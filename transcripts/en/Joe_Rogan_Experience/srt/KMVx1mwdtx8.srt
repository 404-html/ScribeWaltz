1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,970
Boom, and we're live. Hello Charles or
chuck? Which one? So Chuck is my, uh,

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,000
Internet named Charles is like my real
person name. Oh, you're one of those,

3
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,510
do you got a dual personality thing?
Goal at?

4
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:18,630
Somebody took some at some dude in like
Michigan took at Charles C. Johnson,

5
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:22,650
so I was like, all right
chuck. It is then. Does anybody
actually call you chuck?

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,430
Yeah. Um, like my grandma and
like a few people from Boston,

7
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:30,000
but not that many folks. Chuck, what,
what part of Boston you from? Um, from a,

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,530
so it was [inaudible] seven hills
stopped like on the red line. I'm like,

9
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:37,650
did that be like the Dorchester
south line? So I'm from there.

10
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,730
Then we moved to Milton when I uh,
went to, went to school and uh,

11
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,690
Dorchester's a rough neighborhood.
It was more rough back in the day.

12
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:48,510
Now it's become kind of a
Vietnamese kind of, you know,

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,330
there are lots of games that have moved
in. It's kind of moved a little upscale.

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,920
Interesting. The gays are very
good at making things upscale.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,600
It's a gentrification.
You're allowed to say the gay still,

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,290
but you can't say the blacks if you
noticed that. Yeah, I have noticed that.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,770
My rule is that if it's one syllable,
if it's like fewer syllables,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,950
you should be allowed to say it though.
You know like,

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,580
but like you know like African American,
it's really like a long word.

20
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,300
Like blacks. It's just simple. It's like
quick, you can tweet it faster, right?

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,810
Caucasians too much. It
should be white. The whites.

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,030
Now you could say the whites because a
there, you know the preferred, what is it?

23
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,900
Oh, how would you say the
privileged class, and you're
allowed to say the whites,

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,260
but if you say the blacks, it
sounds like derogatory. It is.

25
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,740
It depends on the tone too. Like I
think juice is one of those words too.

26
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:37,440
Or if you say the wrong
tone, that's true. Bad. Yeah.

27
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:41,390
If you say the Jews have one more Nobel
prizes than any other people that,

28
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:44,730
and then you're all right. You
know European Jews, which is true.

29
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,350
They have one more Nobel
prizes for science and I
think than any other racial or

30
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:51,620
gender or religion.
It's not really a race though.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Did you choose your very confusing,
was it,

32
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,430
cause it's you would call it a
race but it's not necessarily,

33
00:01:56,431 --> 00:02:00,300
it's based on a religion, you
know, you like guys, you know,

34
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:03,450
so it's like kind of its own thing and
then you just look at like how wealthy

35
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:05,370
they are and how successful they
are and it's kind of interesting.

36
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,090
It's a grind to get into.
Like if you want to become a Jew,

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,210
my uncle Salvador Digerlando became a Jew,

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,960
married a Jewish woman and I had
to go through the whole grind.

39
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,710
But that mother fucker had a work
like you got to learn a bunch of Shit,

40
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,070
you've got to go to Hebrew school.
It's, it's not easy. It's pretty legit.

41
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,830
Like so legit. It's not like, you know,

42
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,620
I became a Catholic and it
was kind of kind of easy.

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,250
You got to show up for a
few things, you know? Yeah.

44
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:33,990
Like you could be a born
again Christian tomorrow.

45
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:36,060
You could walk into any church and say,
I want to be a Christian.

46
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,230
Like come on in son.

47
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:41,340
The Lord touched you or you just have to
say what is in the Shahada for Muslims,

48
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:42,780
right?
Like is that what you have to do?

49
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,330
You just have to say that and you're good.
Like that's all it is.

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,540
That's all it is. Not the Jews. You
got to jump through hoops. Gotta work.

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,490
They gotta they gotta look
at you side betting. You,

52
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,230
I don't know about this motherfucker.

53
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,790
When did they start using the term you
this for blacks because that's a great

54
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,760
question.
That is a,

55
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:05,761
they never say youths stealing and
rioting when they're dealing with white

56
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:06,610
people.

57
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,350
They will say white teenagers
causing violence. You know what?

58
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,770
They don't say youths.

59
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,670
Will you remember like two years ago
there was like this Huntington beach,

60
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,190
you know,
riot or like stealing bicycles and stuff.

61
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:21,670
I was there like with my wife and I,
we were just like chilling on the beach.

62
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,520
You know, like we start seeing like
all these cops show up and we're like,

63
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,550
what the hell's going on?
Like is it martial law? Like
what's happening? You know,

64
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,290
cause you know, like in
the movies, you know,

65
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,900
like some stuff starts to happen and
then like all the cops show up and it's

66
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:34,870
like by essence since like we were
just kind of confused or whatever.

67
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,480
And the whole like riot took a place in
like an hour and people like turned over

68
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:39,490
a few Porta potties.

69
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,060
And so everyone's been like tweeting out
pictures of that as like white people

70
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:48,010
riot too. And I'm like, no, no. Like
this is not, this is not comparable.

71
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,200
Like I was there for that and I
didn't even know what was going on.

72
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,760
Well the only way you could compare it
as are there pockets of white people that

73
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:59,410
experienced such absolute poverty,
like pockets of black people.

74
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,530
And until you have that,
it's really difficult to,

75
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,960
to make that sort of a comparison.

76
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,010
Like there's no giant ghettos of white
people the way there are giant ghettos.

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,460
But I, I don't know what that
would even look like. I, you know,

78
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,570
I'm sure like the depression, like back
in the old days, yeah. Trailer Park,

79
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:19,510
Irish and Italians back in the day.
But yeah,

80
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:23,500
back in the early 19 hundreds so I'm
sure there were places like that.

81
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,690
We also used to be a bike,
a much more violent,

82
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,420
like white people used to be
much more violent. I think too,

83
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:32,170
like if you just think about like the
index of like bar room fights and all that

84
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,490
stuff.
It's all been like plummeting.

85
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,060
And I don't know if that's because we're
becoming pussies are like what that's

86
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:37,894
about.

87
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,300
But like if you just think about it
like when was the last time you heard of

88
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:43,480
like a legit bar fight?
Recently like Canada,

89
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,820
they still fucking throw down in Canada.
Yeah,

90
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,620
they're Canadians kind of
like a different thing.

91
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,980
There are different kinds of white people.
They're more polite too, which is odd,

92
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,130
but they will fuck you up in a
bar like Jacqueline Hyde, the,

93
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,260
the booze flows, it comes
out well, it's also,

94
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:01,450
they have a long tradition
of hockey fights.

95
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,490
So they have like this sport that you
could use as like an analogy to society

96
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,390
and in that sport occasionally shit goes
wrong and they just start duking it out.

97
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,820
But you know, like I was talking
together mechanics and they like,

98
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,280
they like don't have black people there.
It's like the strangest thing.

99
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,560
What do you mean in Canada? Yeah,
but not, I mean they have them,

100
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:19,570
but they're like not on our,
it's like scale.

101
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:23,140
Like they don't have like urban ghettos
like we, that is true. Yeah. And you know,

102
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:27,790
like, um, there is sort of no
Baltimore equivalent in Canada. Well,

103
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:32,080
they didn't have the level of slavery.
I'm sure there was some slavery in Canada,

104
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,520
but the level of slavery in comparison
to the United States, I mean, we,

105
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:39,490
we will conveniently, people always
want to go, oh, that was so long ago.

106
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,680
Not really. No, no. I mean,
150 years, right. Shit. I mean,

107
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:46,480
Ben Affleck's ancestors on slaves.
Right.

108
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:49,070
Isn't it funny that he was trying
to cover that up? How would that,

109
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,640
I want to know what that
conversation was like. Like a skip,

110
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,390
skip gates like comes in and he's like,
Yo, there's something you should know.

111
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,980
Like, I want to know what
that was like. Right. How

112
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,000
would you break that to somebody?
Um, I guess you would call them.

113
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:03,800
Well,

114
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,300
I don't understand why anybody would
want to cover up the fact that someone in

115
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,970
their life, I guess because
he's benefited from that. Well,

116
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,800
he's called for reparations in the past.
He has. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting.

117
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,890
So I wish, I wonder if he's like,
should I pay up now? Like how does that,

118
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,710
how does that work? That ain't going
to fucking fix shit. It's like,

119
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,990
reparations is like giving people the
lottery money, like lottery winners.

120
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:27,890
They all go broke.

121
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,070
You could just give people reparation
money that's not going to make them feel

122
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:34,400
better. The only way reparations
are really going to work.
Because if you look at,

123
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,770
if you look at it, okay, say you got 18,
65 was women's slavery was abolished,

124
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:42,260
right? Yeah. In this
country. Yeah. Look at, um,

125
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,460
the areas where people had slaves.
Look at the ghettos.

126
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:47,960
Look at these entire,

127
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:51,230
almost entirely black communities
that are ridiculously impoverished.

128
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,990
And then look at this cycle and say,
all right,

129
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,080
there's gotta be a way this can be fixed.
This has gotta be a way,

130
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:59,240
this can be mitigated.
There's gotta be a way you can,

131
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,800
I mean a lot of people say that
that sounds like socialism.

132
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,810
That's all well and good,

133
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:07,811
but until someone steps
in and does something with
these incredibly impoverished

134
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:09,530
areas,

135
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,240
you're going to have this repeating cycle
over and over again of people who were

136
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:18,500
born in poverty and crime ridden streets
that have children that were born in

137
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:19,580
poverty and crime in the streets.

138
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:23,670
And occasionally an athlete breaks
through and occasionally a comedian breaks

139
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:28,160
through or a rapper or musician or
someone escapes this, this cycle.

140
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:30,500
But most people do not.

141
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,530
And that is a symptomatic problem
with these areas. I mean it is,

142
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,570
you have a,
a symptom that needs to be addressed.

143
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,390
You have a shoes issue
that needs to be addressed.

144
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,960
And that's if you wanted to say that
there should be reparations for slavery,

145
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,400
that should be the reparations,

146
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,060
not like individuals getting a
check that's not going to fix shit.

147
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,840
You've got to go in and figuring
out how to make these areas safer,

148
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,720
how to make communities safer,

149
00:07:56,721 --> 00:08:01,150
how to make like community centers and
then give people counseling and, and,

150
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,590
and better education.
You think that would actually work?

151
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:06,860
Like so like there's this thing called
Dick to Shaker heights effect, right?

152
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,990
Where they found that like even like
wealthy black suburbs like, you know,

153
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,970
like in Shaker Heights, Ohio, like
still don't really do all that well.

154
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:18,320
Like the Asian kids still do
better, you know, academically,
you know like, I dunno,

155
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:21,740
I mean I used to be like one of these
guys that thinks that like we could just

156
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:25,100
like solve the problems of the ghetto
and like move everyone out and everything

157
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:28,130
would work out. But I think
there's something to be
said that some people like,

158
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,300
like living there,
you know,

159
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:33,200
like there's kind of like an undercurrent
of our society that they like digs the

160
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,510
poverty stuff that like
digs the gangster style.

161
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,080
I think a lot of the people that
do it's because it's familiar,

162
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,300
it's how they grew up.
I mean,

163
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:45,980
I think if you took that same child
from birth and you know trans,

164
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,680
I mean if you,
if you could obviously couldn't do it,

165
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,470
but if you could live two
completely separate lives,

166
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:55,710
if you could have two of the exact same
people and one of them is born to a

167
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:57,450
really happy,
uh,

168
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,900
educated black couple and they live in
a nice suburb of Atlanta where they'd go

169
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:08,160
to great schools and the other
one is in Baltimore and you,

170
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:12,450
you get to see the same child develop
with different stimuli in different

171
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,000
environment. And one of them was
like, fuck, I liked the ghetto.

172
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,600
And the other one is like, man, I'm glad
I don't live in Baltimore. I mean you, you

173
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,990
say like,

174
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,820
so I was talking to my cousin and my
cousin likes an employer in Baltimore.

175
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,860
Like I know a number of people,
like in Baltimore,

176
00:09:24,861 --> 00:09:27,530
number of black people and there's so many
people who are just sick of this shit,

177
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,100
like so many black, they're like, we
never hear from like from them. Like,

178
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:33,110
we never hear like, oh
fuck, like riots, you know,

179
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,510
like you imagined like were just
like chilling here and there,

180
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,460
like a riot breaks out.
I mean, that's like,

181
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,280
that's like a legit thing that you have
to worry about when you live in some of

182
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:40,700
these community.

183
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,300
It is. Yeah, it is. It absolutely is.
But again, I don't think it's the,

184
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,040
it's a fucked up thing to say,

185
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,200
but I don't think it's the fault
of the people that lived there.

186
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,920
I think the people that live there,
if you look at those kids that rob,

187
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:54,080
that rt reporter, do you see that
today? Yeah. Yeah. That was wild. Wild.

188
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,501
That was like,

189
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:56,770
that was like something out of like
a movie that was like the purge.

190
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,790
You know what I loved about it?
They got saved by the cops.

191
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,950
The Archie reporter got saved by the cops.

192
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,330
The cops came in and tackled the guy
that stole the purse. Like there you go.

193
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:06,680
You need cops.
Okay.

194
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,850
So for all these fucking crazy ultra
progressive fuck the police people,

195
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,920
it's not fuck the police.
It's, um, managing, doing the
fucking job of the police.

196
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,610
It's an impossible job.
It's what it is. No, I

197
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,870
saw it. So I mean, I was the guy who sued
to get Michael Brown's juvenile records.

198
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:24,030
Like we sued unsuccessful,

199
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,380
I think we wake went all the way
to the Supreme Court in Missouri.

200
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,300
Like I like fought this one really hard
because like people should know like

201
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:32,800
what these communities are actually like,

202
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:36,490
like Canfield apartments where they
were brown was from was like a fucked up

203
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:38,800
hell hole.
And like the more we're just,

204
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:42,250
we gotta be honest about these places
and like we need people to actually see

205
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:44,400
them. So whenever we get these
riots it's like on the one hand,

206
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,060
like it's sad and like,
you know,

207
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,860
I'm obviously worried about
my family that's there.

208
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,900
But like on the other hand it's like,

209
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,040
it's such a great illustration of like
reality, you know, like of like, you know,

210
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,920
forget all of your progressive
social justice nonsense.

211
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,010
And like in the final analysis
when the shit goes down,

212
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,510
you either want to have a gun,

213
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:04,240
you want to know a Korean who's
got a gun like here in La, right?

214
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,220
Or you want to like,
you know, take care of,

215
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,530
take care of business and people
don't, people don't get that. They,

216
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,110
this whole like fuck the police mentality
is really causing some serious stuff

217
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:17,450
to go wrong in our society right now
because people are starting to have this

218
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:21,220
like mindset that like cops are evil,
that they're predatory,

219
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:22,150
that they're dangerous.

220
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,810
And it's obvious like why the Obama
administration is pushing it because they

221
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,560
get these consent decrees in where they
can basically rewrite the policing rules

222
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,200
and essentially take over
the policing departments.

223
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,150
So it's obvious like it's a power grab
for like the control of these cities. Um,

224
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,370
and that's why like,
I think we should be very,

225
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:42,700
very cautious about how far we
push it. Because I mean, yeah,

226
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,400
there are some messed up cops and I think,
but you know,

227
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,560
you have to walk a day
in these people's shoes.

228
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,420
Like I did a ride along with the LAPD,

229
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,570
which I highly recommend and there's some
stuff that they have to deal with just

230
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:57,460
like on a routine that's pretty wild.
Like even here in La, you know? Oh,

231
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,430
they certainly do it.

232
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,450
I think the issue is not
that cops bad and that,

233
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:07,360
uh, you know, we need to clean
up the police department.

234
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,750
The issue is we need to figure out a
way to make society safer for everybody

235
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:14,530
involved, including the people that
are stuck in those places, like,

236
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,760
like Brown's apartment complex and the
neighborhood that he lived in. When,

237
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:21,670
you know, growing up in that
neighborhood, man, you're gonna be fucked.

238
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,190
You're fucked.
You're growing up around thugs.

239
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,960
Every one of your friends
are all criminals. Every,

240
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:30,040
it's just the people imitate their
atmosphere. We always have. But you know,

241
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,780
like if you take brown as an example,
right?

242
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,700
We did a bunch of research
on him and he hadn't,

243
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,730
so he went to the second most violent
public school and like all of Missouri and

244
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,950
he actually chose to stay there.
Like he could've moved out with,

245
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:43,870
I think he was a giant dude though.
Yeah.

246
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,850
So that's what I'm saying
though is that like, you know,

247
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:48,970
to some people like living in these
environments can actually be kind of

248
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:51,220
rewarding if you're a big dude and
you don't have a lot of skills,

249
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,250
you can be big Mike and be
an enforcer, you know? Right.

250
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,220
But if big Mike was living in,
you know,

251
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,440
San Francisco and a
really nice neighborhood,

252
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,470
progressive parents went to good schools
from the time he was a baby who did be

253
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:06,100
a different human being, I hope. Thank
you. Yeah, I think you're right. But like,

254
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:07,150
even if you look at like,

255
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,140
I mean if you just look at the
numbers for black on white crime,

256
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:14,650
violence and all that stuff, it's like,
it's pretty, it's pretty shocking.

257
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:19,470
Even among relatively like affluent areas,
you know, it's, I mean, uh, you know,

258
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,610
there's been a lot of
discussion, like, is this innate?

259
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,680
Is this like just something
we have to deal with?

260
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:27,340
Like there's this whole debate
about the m a Oh, a gene,

261
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,370
which is like this gene that black
America black Africans have like much,

262
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,430
it's like a proclivity to violence
that they have and may owe a gene. Um,

263
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,260
I, you know, I recommend people
Google it and do their own research.

264
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:43,030
It's like a big debate
about whether or not,

265
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,080
but basically like what it is is it's,
you know, if we, if you think about like,

266
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,880
you know,
kind of white European,

267
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,250
Asian ancestors as we kind
of moved out of Africa,

268
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,820
like aggression and violence was kind
of less necessary cause we were like

269
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:57,220
farmers and stuff. Right.
Is that really true though?

270
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,580
I mean you look at all the
violence and murder and death,

271
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:05,200
it's been done by the military and you
think about how many people involved in

272
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:08,500
the military are white and how many
people making the decisions are white.

273
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,110
I mean ultimately that's white people
causing violence. True. But like, I mean,

274
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,200
I totally agree with you,
right?

275
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:17,980
Like the industrialized kind of like
Nazi effication or like of like the

276
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:21,460
industrial size, like military industrial
complex is like a serious threat,

277
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,190
no doubt about it. But if you
like there's a book by this guy,

278
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:27,670
Steven pinker [inaudible] hit a about
violence and he's basically like, look,

279
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,360
if you just look throughout human history
of violence is actually going down

280
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,560
because like back in the day,

281
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:36,100
we'd be like in tribal societies and we
would go and beat the shit out of this

282
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:37,870
drive and take their stuff.
And you know,

283
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,440
most of the violence was like we'd
spring up on people and then just butcher

284
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:44,260
them and, you know, steal their
women or whatever. And that,

285
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,460
that was like the way that was like
the way politics was hilarious.

286
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:51,860
That was like a big thing. They would
go and steal women. Where are the women?

287
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,710
Yeah, I'm gonna come
steal them. It's Kinda,

288
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,160
it's Kinda weird like to think about
like that rape culture versus like this,

289
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,210
this fake rape culture that they're trying
to promote. Yeah. Well, I think that, uh,

290
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,800
if you looked at these people, I mean
if you're saying that, um, as a whole,

291
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,090
that white folks are generally slowly
becoming less and less violent,

292
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,750
whereas there is a certain percentage
of whatever it is of black people that

293
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:15,770
contain this gene.

294
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,310
Look at what black people have to
deal with as opposed to white people.

295
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:23,420
Like what we were talking about with
Canada, Canada has no, no black ghetto,

296
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:27,470
if you're growing up in a ghetto is,
I mean,

297
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:30,380
you're fucked from birth.
I mean, you really are.

298
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:33,760
There's really not much as far
as options to get out. Sure.

299
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:38,890
And the constant inundation of negative
influences is his innocent blood out.

300
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,570
I mean, we always talk
about people like, you know,

301
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:44,330
getting out of the ghetto and
thriving, right? Like we always like,

302
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:45,410
that's always like the thing you hear,

303
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,930
like when you hear about it like
successful black Americans, right?

304
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,860
It's like the one tuna that gets
through the net. You're right. Whole,

305
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,300
we never hear about people being like,
you know,

306
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:55,070
I started a great small
business in the ghetto,

307
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:58,820
in the ghetto is my corner of the ghetto
is now got Starbucks on every corner.

308
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,211
You know,

309
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:02,390
that was one of the saddest things about
Ferguson was they were robbing black

310
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:05,810
owned businesses. Yeah. Smashing down
the windows, burning them down. I mean,

311
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:08,750
this was like people were freaking
out. They were like, God damn it.

312
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,630
I'm a part of his fucking community.
I didn't shoot that kid.

313
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:12,950
I didn't do anything wrong.

314
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,910
You're using this as an opportunity
to better yourself using this as an

315
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:21,680
opportunity to steal and just take things
and claim that it's because there's

316
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:25,340
one guy got shot and you look at
like, um, like my in laws family,

317
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,050
they're a Asian immigrants.
You know,

318
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:30,290
my wife's an immigrant from you and you
look at like the kind of neighborhoods

319
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,700
they move into to kind of like,
you know,

320
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:35,310
run the corner store or run like
the quickie mart or whatever. Um,

321
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,280
terribly racist set up.
But nonetheless,

322
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:38,900
it's like there's some
truth in the stereotype.

323
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,140
And then you look at like
welcome to America. We, you
know, the Democratic Party,

324
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:43,190
we love immigrants.

325
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,440
And yet if you build your little
corner of the American dream,

326
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:47,930
we're not going to protect
you when the riots start.

327
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,350
And you look at a lot of these businesses
that were like burned out in Ferguson

328
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,610
and they were like,
you know,

329
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,030
a nice guy from India coming to this
country putting away some money for his

330
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:59,750
family and yet like his property was
destroyed and there's a whole bunch of

331
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,930
right wing,
you know,

332
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,210
people on go fund me trying to raise money
to basically make these people whole.

333
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,940
Um, it's kind of like, it's
kind of wild. But I think,

334
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:10,180
I think the technology plus the,
the,

335
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,700
the history of violence plus like the
ghetto politics and the urban policy,

336
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,150
I think all of that's like combining
right now to create this like massive

337
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:19,850
craziness. I mean, everyone's
got iPhones, everyone's like,

338
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,520
it's like flash mobs meets
Ma, you know, the real mob.

339
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,880
Everyone does have this unique ability
to organize riots or protests or meet at

340
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,350
this place and meet at that place.

341
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:34,010
And I have friends that were involved
in the black lives matter thing and they

342
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,980
would organize these things and
most of the things I disagreed with,

343
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:40,030
like especially the blocking the
highway shit, I was like, it's wild,

344
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,650
guys are causing death.
You're going to cause death.

345
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,590
You're going to cause someone's loved
ones to die because they can't get to the

346
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:47,450
hospital. That's a fucking fact. Yeah, no,

347
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:49,890
it actually happened I think in a
few occasions. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

348
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:53,070
and then you're doing it to just
because lives matter. Okay. Look,

349
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:56,100
this is the transportation system.
It's where we get medicine through.

350
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,960
It's where we get people to the hospital.

351
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,890
It's the way we get important things
happen on these roads and you're being

352
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:05,400
insanely irresponsible. If you want
to, you want to block something,

353
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,180
find out where they make the laws and
don't let anybody leave block that you

354
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:11,730
know and you want to get
arrested somewhere and you
want to make a big stink,

355
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,020
go to the fucking Capitol building block,
that fucking thing. Storming the lawn,

356
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,501
you know?

357
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:20,880
But you can't block the God damn
highway because that's just too random.

358
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,340
I mean you, you, you're from
the Boston area too. Yeah.

359
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:25,320
So you remember when there
was the Boston thing,

360
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:28,500
like it was like a black lives matter
protest in Boston and they like shut down

361
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:31,830
the freeway and like the guy who was like
running that was like this hedge fund,

362
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,130
you know, he's like the son of
some wealthy family and it's like,

363
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,160
it's always like these
super like, you know, uh,

364
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,720
kind of liberal white people who
are like trying to like, you know,

365
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,380
strike back at the system and you look
at all those people who are like you.

366
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,560
I mean it sounds like kind of,
kind of, kind of silly to say this,

367
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,320
but like if you're delayed from
work for like 30 minutes or an hour,

368
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:55,940
like that has like a serious impact on
your whole day. It has an impact on your,

369
00:18:55,941 --> 00:18:59,340
your job. I mean, let's say you're trying
to huff it to get to work, but hey man,

370
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,160
protests are not supposed
to be convenient man. Yeah.

371
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:06,390
But it's like such a Dick thing to do.
Well, it's, it's, it's shortsighted.

372
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,380
I think the idea that these hedge fund
guys realized they were born into this

373
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:14,580
privileged life and they want to somehow
know to give back or make an impact.

374
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:18,570
I love that. I think that's great. I
just don't think that's the way to do it.

375
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:21,630
And I think they get organized
like fuck the system.

376
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:25,410
Fuck Yay everybody was to put a
backpack on and run through the street.

377
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,290
That is not how you change things.
It's just not,

378
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,310
it's certainly how you make a little
bit of a stink, you know, hey,

379
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:34,020
can you make a ripple?
You get some cameras on you.

380
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:39,021
And I would hope that some of this stuff
will stop some cops from shooting kids

381
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,410
when they don't have to.

382
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,630
I mean I think there are times where a
police officer is saving someone else's

383
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:49,020
life or trying to protect their own
life and they have to use violent force.

384
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,180
That's a fact.
Yeah.

385
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,610
But there was a lot of times where cops
shoot people with it shouldn't fucking

386
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:55,990
shoot people and you know it.
And I knew of it.

387
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:59,250
We've all seen the videos and
there's no denying it. And I think,

388
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,040
but they're humans, you know, like what
would you do in that situation? I mean,

389
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,700
I always made a point is like you,

390
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,660
you got to look at the whole thing
like what we're talking about with the

391
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:11,280
ghettos and white people
and, and violence. You've got
to look at the whole thing.

392
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,500
And the whole thing is w determinism,

393
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:15,990
there's a bunch of different variables
that are taking place that are causing

394
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:18,870
certain Accenture. And if
you just say, you know,

395
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:21,600
we gotta block the highway
to make black lives matter.

396
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,180
What about a black guy that dies because
it's fucking wife wants to get him to

397
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,450
the hospital because he hasn't got damn
heart attack. What about that black life?

398
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,150
You don't give a fuck. But you know,
a lot of it though is just like,

399
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,780
it's like vanity, you know what I mean?
It's like posturing. It's like, um,

400
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,440
it's like advertising your virtuousness
by how much you hate this, right?

401
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,290
Once you hate that. And what's kind
of weird to me is that like there,

402
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,440
we've created a culture right now where
the people who can basically like be

403
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:48,100
professional fuck

404
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,810
the system people, you know, and it's
like, it's wild that these people exist.

405
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,350
Like in our society like that that
basically they wake up every day and they

406
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:59,800
have enough money, they have enough like
donations, whatever to basically just,

407
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,100
you know, fuck the system
professionally. And it's like,

408
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:06,610
to a certain extent the system probably
has accounted for these people. You know,

409
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:09,400
like to a certain extent they buy them
off by giving them like, you know,

410
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,550
working on Wall Street or the giving
them, you know, prestigious internships.

411
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,330
But like to a certain extent these
people end up becoming tools of the very

412
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,380
thing that they're trying to eat.
Well like think about it.

413
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:24,250
Like what are they actually like?
They're not really accomplishing anything.

414
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,200
So like the social justice warrior
types there are basically reflecting the

415
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:34,510
establishment view of the colleges.
Right. And what are these colleges?

416
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,590
They're basically like giant money pits
with have large endowments who then

417
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:42,850
invest in, you know, all kinds of
things. Like, and I mean in, you know,

418
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,660
uh, if you look at like
all the investments they're
doing, like fossil fuels,

419
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:48,610
you're looking at all the investments
they do. And like, I mean,

420
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,550
the colleges are so much a
part of the system, right?

421
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,490
And what they're doing is the social
justice warriors are taking their crazy

422
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:57,850
nonsense that they're learning in schools
and they're trying to imply it to like

423
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:58,810
the rest of society.

424
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,290
But if we did stuff like if right
away what we did was we said, look,

425
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,700
any of these in college endowments,
they have to pay out like 5% of their,

426
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:07,661
of their tuition.

427
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,800
Like we do with foundations immediately
colleges free for a lot of people,

428
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:13,570
people aren't making massive student debt,

429
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,900
but instead the colleges like fight
their fight for their privilege. So like,

430
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:17,860
I think what,
what I'm,

431
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,920
what I'm trying to say is that basically
like the bees people are basically the

432
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:24,700
shock troops for the elite without even
knowing that they're shocked groups for

433
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:25,900
the elite.
Right?

434
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:29,500
Like if you think about like if we talk
to like the rape culture stuff, right?

435
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,820
It's like a perfect example of this.

436
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,440
People are trying to advance a narrative
about women and about society and it's

437
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:37,750
a power grab.
I mean it's really as simple as that.

438
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,350
Like they're trying to end due process
rights for young men on campus.

439
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:44,080
They're trying to basically
give a, uh, you know,

440
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:47,710
if you don't create a know a title
nine compliant college, you know,

441
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:48,610
what we're gonna do is we're going to,

442
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:51,670
we're going to stick our trial lawyers
on you and sue you. What does title nine?

443
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,070
So basically what the feminists say,
all right,

444
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:56,770
this is how they get in to
like the whole college racket.

445
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,520
We can probably talk
about that if you want.

446
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,110
But basically what they do is they say,
all right,

447
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:05,110
you're not creating a college campus
environment because you allow too many

448
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:06,130
rapes on campus.

449
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,640
You're not creating college environment
that's conducive to men and women.

450
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,030
So like what you're doing
is essentially your,

451
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:16,120
because you have all these rapists running
around what they're, what, you know,

452
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:18,320
it's harder for girls
to get good education.

453
00:23:18,321 --> 00:23:20,320
So you have to create
these like special courts.

454
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,060
And if you don't create
them to our liking,

455
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:24,650
we're going to sue you and you have a lot
of money because if you have, you know,

456
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,330
these endowments we just talked about
and so it's basically like trial lawyers

457
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:32,920
combining with SJWs to basically to
w being social. Social's for us this.

458
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

459
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,860
I mean it's funny how like all this stuff
has been reduced to like three or four

460
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:42,140
characters. You know, it's like
all like, yeah, it's the, yeah,

461
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,890
it's the Twitter thing
that's like infecting your
brain, right? Also military,

462
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:46,430
military

463
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,410
IED is, they love doing
that stuff. You know,

464
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:50,930
he talked to guys that had been in
the military, they love using those.

465
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,640
Not An acronym. Right? An acronym is
like NASA, right? If you say NASA,

466
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,810
like I don't know if it's an acronym,
the abbreviation, whatever it is,

467
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,310
whichever else I should know what
that is. Um, but it's okay, so,

468
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,160
so what you're saying
is that these people,

469
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:11,420
it almost becomes like
a Gig. Yeah. They like,

470
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:14,090
they like never leave.
They never mentally live.

471
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,040
They never mentally leave college.

472
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,010
Well that's a real problem with academics
in general because a lot of people who

473
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:22,580
are academics, they went to college,
they went to graduate school,

474
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,160
they got their doctorate, they
got their phd, whatever they got,

475
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,280
and then they started teaching and
they never entered the real world.

476
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:31,790
And they live in this world
of extreme liberal values,

477
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,350
extreme liberal biases. And who pays for
that? Like the tuition of the kids, right?

478
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,260
Yeah. And then the endowments that
he's like massively rich schools,

479
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:43,940
which are all invested in like horribly
anti social justice warrior causes.

480
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,420
But what is it that about colleges?
This is where it gets fascinating with me.

481
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,710
What is it about colleges that
almost invariably lean left?

482
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,000
Like there's questions you call. I
mean it wasn't always this way, right?

483
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,060
I mean if you look back historically,
like in the 20s and stuff,

484
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:02,650
they were kind of right wing places,
Kinda hate left and right. I really do.

485
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,130
I kind of hate saying it.

486
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:08,270
I really mad at myself that I just said
it because I am just as right as I am.

487
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:12,350
I mean, I am pro gay
rights, pro gay marriage,

488
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:15,890
Pro Chan's transgender rights,
transgender marriage,

489
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:19,840
pro abortion. I'm pro
choice. I'm pro, I'm,

490
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:24,050
I'm so left in so many ways.
Um, I'm against the drug war.

491
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:26,270
I'm against privatized prisons.
I'm against,

492
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,600
I'm pro legalization of drugs,
um, against police violence. Sure.

493
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,380
But I'm also in the NRA, you know,
also, I think the military is important.

494
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:39,590
I think if you go to parts of the world
and see how fucked up it is and you

495
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:41,450
don't think you need to have a military,
well,

496
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:44,930
you're being a child because we
don't live in utopia yet. We're not,

497
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:49,370
we're not in a, in a time in the
world where it's safe. We're not,

498
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:51,290
we haven't reached some
age of enlightenment.

499
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,440
We're on some strange gradual progression
pace to one day be free of all the ape

500
00:25:57,951 --> 00:26:01,430
violence that lives in our genetics,
but in tool. I hope you're right.

501
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:03,170
I don't know.
I don't see it happening anytime soon.

502
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,390
I mean if you look at what's
happening in Baltimore, it seems like,

503
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,810
it seems like a lot of the times are
kind of primal instincts and our kind of

504
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:09,650
violent stuff.

505
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,980
It seems like it's lurking just beneath
that thin veneer of civilization.

506
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,020
That's Baltimore.
And here's the other problem.

507
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,790
We're talking about a country of 350
million people yet here we are in woodland

508
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,880
hills. Go outside. What are you going
to see your birds Chirp? Beautiful.

509
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:26,510
It's sunny out. People are
Nice. Go to Starbucks down
the street. They'll say, hi,

510
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,820
can I help me? Everybody's
friendly. You know,

511
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,880
this isn't barbarian culture or
maybe talk to you about ages,

512
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:36,080
race matters or something.
Larry is when they tried to do that,

513
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:40,330
is that the quickest accompany
has ever abandoned an idea start.

514
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,040
Let's explain it to people, but a lot
of people again who have lives unlike

515
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,120
us, they might've missed this
particular thought. It was, I thought,

516
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,840
I thought it was the onion and then I
looked into like the corporate leadership

517
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:53,370
of it and they're like all white dudes.

518
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,220
They're like all white dudes and
white chicks. Hey, I got an idea.

519
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,530
This is the way that we
can make things different.

520
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,600
Let's encourage our Brrristas
to talk about race. Hey,

521
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,480
you want to a cop? And she knew, um,

522
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,670
how do you feel about black be the bell?
I wonder what that I would say

523
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:15,750
I wanted to go in. So like what my buddy
and I went into the Compton, uh, you know,

524
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,870
Starbucks like right when they were doing
this and I was wearing like a suit and

525
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,250
like a, you know, expensive tie,

526
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:22,860
like all that stuff would come in there
and like we're the only white dudes in

527
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:25,620
there. Like where are the, you
know, where the dot and the domino,

528
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,800
you know what I mean?
And we're like walking up and I was so,

529
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:31,110
cause they had the race matters
things out and I was like reading it,

530
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,070
I was like leaning
like behind me,

531
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:38,440
it's like a nation of Islam,
like you know, coffee meetup.

532
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,350
Because apparently they have those
like, yeah, seriously, I'm not,

533
00:27:41,351 --> 00:27:45,060
I'm not making this up. Bean pies off. And
there's like a picture of me like yeah,

534
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:48,220
I put it up on my Twitter of me
like reading the, the, you know,

535
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,930
race matters thing while they're, you
know, behind me, you know, discussing all,

536
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,870
that's Hillary you have done on Twitter.
I have on Twitter. Yeah, find out,

537
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,920
find that Twitter and let's put it, I'll
retweet it. That's fucking hilarious.

538
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,480
But so explain the campaign because a lot
of people would have no idea what's it.

539
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,770
Basically there's this
idea that Starbucks had,

540
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:07,260
which was that like the
future of the country,

541
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,110
their views that like we're going
to be a much more racial society,

542
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:12,480
which is probably true. Like you
know, diversity and all that.

543
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:14,310
People moving in immigration so forth.

544
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,430
And so their view is that like we need
to get ahead of it and we need to talk

545
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:19,770
about race because like
that's like a big issue.

546
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,520
And their attitude was like if we get
people together talking about stuff,

547
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:24,930
stuffing coffee shops, it
will be like, you know,

548
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:27,540
it's like the old salon stuff
like the 1850s or something.

549
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:31,260
People are going to be debating issues
and politics and all this and it just

550
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:34,650
totally backfired because
people were not having it.

551
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,120
They were just making fun of it.

552
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:37,860
They were making fun of the
guy who was the head of it.

553
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:42,660
Unbelievably stupid and poorly planned
out to the idea that you're just going to

554
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:46,130
put that on w one thing.
Writing it on cups or something like that.

555
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:46,891
We're going to write,
yeah,

556
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,780
they're going to read it on
cups that are going to basically

557
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,940
Hashtag race together. Is this the
guy? This is a guy, I swear to God.

558
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,520
I thought this was an onion
because you know their stuff.

559
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,550
I mean it's so preposterous.
Race together. What the
fuck does that even mean?

560
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:06,330
That's a terrible Hashtag [inaudible] it
sounds like something for the marathon

561
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,650
race together.

562
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:11,670
You know like if maybe if you were running
a marathon and everybody donated and

563
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:12,770
the charities went towards

564
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:17,140
the human race. It's like if you,
if you read it, the non, the non PC,

565
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:18,370
it's a race to get her

566
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,520
was a friend of mine was
clearly he was like, is this,

567
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,770
is this a subtle rape culture thing?
Oh No.

568
00:29:27,771 --> 00:29:32,680
What a backfire. Well that's why they
capitalize the t and they are sir. No,

569
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,750
but you can't, you can't not
see it. Once you see that,

570
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,280
oh you can't see a picture of the
chick. So true. That's so funny.

571
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:42,010
She's got her hands up like dope rape

572
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,030
me. I have fins. I don't
even have hands. Oh fuck.

573
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:47,170
That's hilarious.

574
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,140
But Starbucks I think stopped being
cool when they changed the check.

575
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:53,020
Like remember where like way back in the
day she had like you could like see her

576
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:56,170
boobs and every time it's right.
Those cowards and they changed it.

577
00:29:56,171 --> 00:30:00,920
So she's like Nazism androgynous.
What's wrong with boobs railing?

578
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,050
Come on, relax. Everybody
relaxed. It's kind of nuts.

579
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,290
Did the race together.
That'll be ditching race to get her,

580
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,000
we should just say it
was just called that.

581
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,240
So this race to get her idea was they
would put a Hashtag on the cup and what

582
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,710
would spark up a conversation
that would lead the fucking line.

583
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:19,450
The lines are long enough for Starbucks.

584
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:22,870
Those slow poke ass motherfuckers need
to drink their own coffee cause they're

585
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:23,830
always real slow.

586
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,250
Well imagine if you are like and metric
if you're like actually a Barista, right?

587
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,470
So you're like there,
you're probably a Barista.

588
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:32,500
Like nobody likes sets out in like, yeah,
I'm going to be a Starbucks Barista.

589
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,710
Like this is not like something you set
out like wanting to do with your life.

590
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,710
I mean I'm sure it's a perfectly good job,
but like nobodies,

591
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,070
nobody dreams about this when they're a
little kid and so you're working there,

592
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,920
you know, you're having to deal with
all these like, you know, bitchy,

593
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:48,010
caffeinated people. Right? And
like you're supposed to just like,

594
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,590
Yo take some time out to go and
discuss race with some custom,

595
00:30:51,591 --> 00:30:53,590
something like stranger.
I mean it's Kinda like,

596
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,570
it's kind of like a very
anti employee mindset, right?
Like, and their timing them,

597
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:01,550
they time them on their drink orders.
So it's like kind of a really,

598
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:04,900
they really like how cells
they said like Tippett. Um, no.

599
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:07,510
What they'll do is they'll time people
on like how long did it take you to do

600
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:10,420
this coffee? Like when they're doing
the training, the training stuff,

601
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,210
and they want you to basically,
you know, do it faster.

602
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:16,960
But apparently your experiences
that hasn't sort of worked
out well did not that

603
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:20,890
bad. I'm fucking around joking around, but
you know, I have been to Starbucks with,

604
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:22,150
they're slow as shit and you're like,

605
00:31:22,151 --> 00:31:26,080
there's no double Cappuccino and that
guy's diet. Kick it up a little sign.

606
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:27,070
I got to get out of it.
Wish you could.

607
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,270
I wish you could pay to get faster
in line like you can at Tsa.

608
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,830
You know, like I know that's like a
terribly privileged thing to say anything.

609
00:31:35,831 --> 00:31:36,860
But sometimes you're like,
Yo,

610
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,030
trying to get to work or
whatever or trying to get to
somewhere and you're like,

611
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,490
fuck it. I need to like, I need my
coffee and I just get outta here.

612
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,400
You know what I mean? And there should
be some way you can be like, nope.

613
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,120
Like I know what you're,

614
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,470
I don't know what you have to pay a year
to get like the expedited service or

615
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:54,070
something. But yeah, I don't know either.
I've gotten that accident only before,

616
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,970
but I never,
I never,

617
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,670
I always say I'm going to sign up
for it but I never signed up for it.

618
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,680
Are He tried to sign up for it
and they denied him. Really? Yeah.

619
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,500
He's an asshole to TSA so
he's an asshole to him.

620
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,920
He got screened once. This guy, he farted
in front of this guy and go, go ahead.

621
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,720
You got to smell my fart now he's
like farted really loud cause his,

622
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,680
his idea is that this is
not protecting anybody.

623
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:22,620
This is a absolutely a violation of our
rights and if you don't yeah and protest

624
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,820
it, it'll escalate. My Buddy Neil who's a,

625
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,810
he's a Tsh and he couldn't get a
job anywhere else and he hates it.

626
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,990
Like it's like the most solace job ever.
And he was saying like,

627
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,930
God bless you to people like right before
they're getting on their flights and

628
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:37,720
the TSA people are like, no, you can't
say that anymore. To people and he's like,

629
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,070
well,
you made me swear an oath to like,

630
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,190
you know, under God to like,
you know, like why can't I just,

631
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,780
he's not even like a Super Christian
Guy. He's just like, yeah, God bless you.

632
00:32:45,781 --> 00:32:47,570
Like have a nice day.
It's kind of his way of doing it,

633
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,670
just to try and meet and just
trying to be nice and they're like

634
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,430
the nation of Islam. People in the back,
it's funny. Or The Nation of Islam,

635
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:56,331
they're back.

636
00:32:56,331 --> 00:33:00,260
The like the dude behind the chick is
there and then there's some other folks in

637
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:04,030
front of me too. That's
so funny. Yeah, so my,

638
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,750
and it was all black people working behind
the counter and everything. Yeah. Yeah.

639
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,810
Did you ask anybody? Did you interview
anybody? How they feel about it was like,

640
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:14,090
well, what's going on with this?
And they're like, we don't know.

641
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,320
Like they just put these things here.
They're just trying to get paid. Why?

642
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,280
Why the fuck did they have to
deal with this stupid shit?

643
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,140
Could you imagine if like you,

644
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,220
you're supposed to be some social
justice engineer while administering

645
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:27,800
cappuccinos? This is, it's so goofy.

646
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,010
It's such a weird thing to ask
your employees to do. Bull idea.

647
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,400
Like nobody's doing this at home depot.
You know what I mean?

648
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,460
Like what kind of education in the
subtle nuances of race relations are you

649
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:40,580
giving these people before you have them
communicate publicly on behalf of your

650
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:41,300
company?

651
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:46,300
Waddling while an employee like I couldn't
think of a more poorly thought out

652
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:50,840
idea executed by a giant corporation.
Totally agree with you.

653
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:53,300
And then you the fact that it was
like designed to all by white people.

654
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,290
Like it's like the weirdest part.
Zach. I have a black girlfriend,

655
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,840
the older dude that was
in the race to get her,

656
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,780
I know it's a good question.

657
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,720
He might have a hot black girlfriend
and she's trying to like the bill Maher

658
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:08,930
thing where he thinks he
can like criticize black
people cause he's dated them

659
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:11,530
kind of thing. Is that what he does?
Yeah, that's what he does. Yeah.

660
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,540
It feels like he can criticize
and he said this, he said like,

661
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:17,850
I've had black hair on my pillow.
I like, it's, Oh God. He's like,

662
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,300
you said stuff like that. Oh
that's so gross. It's creepy.

663
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:28,270
That black hair on my pillow.
Oh you girls.

664
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:33,740
It's such a weird thing to do.
It's fucking statement.

665
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,140
I've had black hair on my pillow.

666
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,140
I think he set it on something
like marriage counseling thing too.

667
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:42,460
You know how they have like guest judges
or whatever. I remember watching that.

668
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:44,930
I was like,
well yeah that is crazy.

669
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:51,470
I just think that if you just, if you're
capable of saying something like that,

670
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,980
I think he's probably just
trying to be like, you know,

671
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,500
cause he's a joke writer
and he's a like a one word,

672
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,940
one line impact sort of a guy.
That's a kind of thing.

673
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:05,030
I've had black hair on my pillow and
you could say things like that's like

674
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:07,040
something that you can see on his show.

675
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,160
Like that would be a line
to like it's concise.

676
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:13,490
It's quick and has a period at the end
of it and it boom and as an impact. Sure,

677
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,150
sure. Yeah. I mean something you could
see on his show but it didn't quite work.

678
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,710
You can't fault them too much for it
because of the way he communicates for a

679
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:26,650
living. But as a person, like if you
were hanging out with them. Yeah.

680
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,920
In fairness, like I got some shit
on Twitter cause like, uh, so I,

681
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:32,210
I kept getting all the stuff like your
anti-immigrant and your other stuff

682
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:33,500
because I was like tweeting
out stuff like, hey,

683
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:36,860
we should be kind of careful about this
amnesty stuff. And uh, I was like, yeah,

684
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:38,160
I hate immigrants so much.
I'm married

685
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,280
one. And then all of these people
were like, all these people are like,

686
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:44,160
you're using your Asian wife, you
know, to like protect you or whatever.

687
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,490
And then I just Hashtag [inaudible]
at my Asian wife and I was like,

688
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,920
my Asian white. Yeah. Like I
was just like making fun of it.

689
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,890
And then people thought I like the social
justice warriors thought I was serious.

690
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,070
So like all of like the Asian social
justice warriors started being like,

691
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,060
you know, my wife is like a cultural,
like appropriation, you know,

692
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,000
whatever nonsense they were spewing.
I remember just sitting,

693
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:06,300
sitting back like yeah, that's why as
my wife and I were like having like,

694
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,580
I think we were having like omelets
or something in the morning like just

695
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:10,440
sitting on, you know like
in, when you, you know,

696
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:13,020
when you wake up on a Sunday and you're
still in your pajamas or whatever,

697
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,240
it's like holy shit honey.
I think I accidentally started a movement.

698
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:22,320
That is a very funny line though. What
he said, I hate immigrants so much.

699
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:26,010
I'm married one. That's very
funny. I mean it's kind of true.

700
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:28,860
The amnesty thing would be the people
that have been in this country for a

701
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:32,460
certain amount of time be allowed
to be United States citizens.

702
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,250
I mean here's basically the Gig,
right?

703
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:39,000
So like people like my wife came to this
country from Indonesia and can't really

704
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:42,390
swim from there. It's kind of a long
way. And like they waited in line,

705
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:44,160
they like followed all the
rules and all this stuff.

706
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,950
And then we've got all these people who
come into this country illegally from

707
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:48,690
like Mexico south of the border.

708
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:51,360
Cause just cause it's easier to get here
and there are a lot of folks who want

709
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:54,440
to make them citizens. The Democrats
want to do it because they get, you know,

710
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,990
lots of voters, the Republicans want
to do it because they get cheap labor,

711
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,420
you know,
and basically drive down wages are,

712
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,880
some Republicans want to do it
and I'm just like, you know,

713
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:04,930
it's probably not a good idea to like,
you know,

714
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,700
give away citizenship like this because
we have a lot of people who desperately

715
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:11,220
want to get in here and it's kind of like,
it's kind of racist in a way.

716
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,070
It's kind of like pro Mexican in a way.
If you think about it,

717
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:17,310
just like logically because yeah,
that people from Africa, from Europe,

718
00:37:17,311 --> 00:37:19,950
whatever who wanted a much
harder time and it's just like,

719
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,330
it's a much kind of unfair
process. You know? I have a very,

720
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:29,370
I wouldn't say unrealistic or Utopian
view of this whole thing. I feel like for,

721
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,510
first of all, I'm not a big fan of
nationalism. I'm not a big fan of borders,

722
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:38,870
but I'm also not a big fan of fucking it
up where people have figured out how to

723
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:42,180
get it right and not necessarily
the United States has got it right.

724
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,240
But I think the real solution is not
to like make it easier for people to

725
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:48,630
immigrant.

726
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,890
The real solution is to make it
easier for Mexicans to live in Mexico.

727
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:57,750
Oh totally agree. Like Mexico. So like
it goes amazing. Go there on vacation.

728
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:59,910
It's fucking beautiful.
Like it should be like,

729
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,200
but there are all these anti
white people laws there.

730
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:05,310
They're all these antique gringo laws.
Like you can't own beach front property.

731
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:07,140
If you're a white guy there you can't,
you can't,

732
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:11,850
you have to or have some
crazy beach front. Probably
has some like Alibaba Dude,

733
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,481
you know who like,

734
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:15,120
no seriously though like you know they
have like some Mexican guy who is like

735
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:17,010
the front man for him that runs his thing.

736
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:20,850
But like there are all these antique
gringo rules down there and it's kind of

737
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:24,060
like my attitude is like everything we
allow Mexicans to do in the states we

738
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:25,860
should be allowed to do in their country.
Right.

739
00:38:25,861 --> 00:38:27,750
I should be able to get a driver's
license in Mexico. You know,

740
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:30,510
you should be able to do all this stuff.
And why not?

741
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,510
Like I think the real tragedy about the
Mexico, first of all, like the drug war,

742
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,980
like a policy.

743
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:39,670
We've got to get rid of it cause it's
like clearly fucking up Mexico. Um,

744
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,480
but we got to just like make Mexico like
a good place to live because maybe that

745
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:47,980
way they won't all move here. You know,
like if you, if you live down there like,

746
00:38:47,981 --> 00:38:51,910
and you're like in cartel land and you
go to the u s and you get paid like 15,

747
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,480
you know, 15 times more money than
you would otherwise. I mean, why?

748
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,570
The real question I have is like,
given how shitty things are in Mexico,

749
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:02,290
why are so many of them still there? You
know, like you have like a great country.

750
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,320
Well, there's a fucking wall,
first of all. Well sort of,

751
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:08,200
but like people are breaking in
all the time, but it's not easy,

752
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:11,420
especially if you have a
baby with, sure, sure. Yeah.

753
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:16,620
I have a friend who came over here
illegally and she came over here with her

754
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:17,501
baby man.

755
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:20,410
She had a fucking two year old baby
and she made it to the United States.

756
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,760
How'd she do it? They got an a
van or some crazy shit, you know?

757
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:27,670
I mean it was all decades ago, but
it's, yeah. Yeah, like back in the day,

758
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:30,580
I think it was a lot easier and
it's also terrifying shit, man.

759
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:35,380
If you really stop and think about the
idea of going in a van illegally across

760
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:39,040
the border that's got a fence and you
have a baby with you and you're just

761
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,380
hoping for a better life.
But you know, I've been, so,

762
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:43,870
my uncle lives in Guatemala of all places,
believe it or not.

763
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,010
Like I live in Guatemala, but yeah, as
he just banging young Guatemalan chicks,

764
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,310
I don't really know. We don't talk
about tall man. That would want to know.

765
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,730
I know he likes to drink down there
cause that's what I'm talking about.

766
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:58,200
Go down there with a fucking fat bottle
of Tequila and ask him some questions.

767
00:39:58,201 --> 00:40:01,210
I mean you can get beer, they're like
16 cents. Like, I mean it's just,

768
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:03,760
it's out of control. Um, but
I've been to the Guatemala,

769
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:07,540
Mexico border and it's like, you know,
there's like machine gun turrets and like,

770
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:08,800
so like,
you know,

771
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:12,460
they're always criticizing our border
buildup and yet if you go to their border

772
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:15,340
with their southern neighbor because
they don't want the Guatemalans breaking

773
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:19,120
into their country. That's
hilarious. So it's like, you know,

774
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:22,510
they're all criticizing the u s for being
racist and everything and yet there,

775
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,990
you know, well that's one of the
things about if you talk to Latinos,

776
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:28,320
like tail always joke around about the,

777
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:31,060
the racism inside Latino culture.

778
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,990
White dudes like don't have any
idea about this. Mexican's are,

779
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,540
have always had a problem with Puerto
Ricans and it's the way that's been

780
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,940
established as in boxing
and the boxing world.

781
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,630
The Mexicans voice had Puerto Ricans
are lazy and like this Mexican fighters

782
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:46,090
versus Puerto Rican fighters
had been a longterm rivalry.

783
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,200
And then there's the Cubans and the Cubans
have a problem with the Puerto Ricans

784
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:55,201
and then there's the Guatemalans Hondurans
who get no respect and it goes like

785
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,810
lower and lower. The further south you
go, the more they fuck with him. No,

786
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:02,020
totally right. I mean, and you look at
like here with the Salvadorans and the uh,

787
00:41:02,021 --> 00:41:06,640
the Salvadorian gangs versus the Mexican
ones. And it's like, you know, to, uh,

788
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,920
to the social justice warriors are
all Hispanic or Latino, Latino.

789
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:11,860
But then you actually like,

790
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,610
these are like legit countries that
have like legit histories and you know,

791
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,900
the real problem and things,

792
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:22,080
even the term social justice
warrior is that they're aggressive.

793
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,830
Like the, the thing about social justice,
so it's like, what do you, what do you,

794
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:30,190
what do you really want? What you
want? Peace it. Guess where it,

795
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:33,980
guess what the worst way to get pieces
being an asshole. Oh, totally. Being

796
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,430
an asshole will almost
kind of antisocial and yes,

797
00:41:36,431 --> 00:41:38,490
there's a sentence in a lot
of ways cause they're like,

798
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,900
like they're about doxing people and
aggressively pursuing actions against them

799
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:47,690
and trying to get people fired because
they don't share their ideology.

800
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,750
The weirdest road testing. Totally
agree. Like the weirdest thing to me.

801
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,630
And I think like people have
started to becoming more like,

802
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:55,910
I've certainly become more aggressive
just dealing with their shit,

803
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,850
you know what I mean? Like
less aggressive. Believe it
or not about them. Like I,

804
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:00,684
I don't,

805
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:04,430
I don't want to fight with that kind of
shit at all because I think it's because

806
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,750
it creates a dust cloud of confusion
because it's counterproductive.

807
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,960
Totally counterproductive. And I share
their beliefs on a lot of things.

808
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:16,580
I just don't, I don't share their
methodology. I don't share the,

809
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,290
the aggressive tactics and I just think
that what they're doing is like insanely

810
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:23,650
short sided. They think that
their Malcolm x or something,

811
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:28,400
they think that they're like trying to
fight the system by screaming, yelling,

812
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,540
fuck capitalism.

813
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:32,570
And it's kind of like the people
who are born like after the 60s,

814
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,020
like they were born after
the party and I'm like,

815
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,450
and then you could tell they're
kind of pissed about it. My friend,

816
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:43,010
my friend Andy Sarabian and I were
talking about this and uh, uh,

817
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,980
we were talking a lot about like
how basically they target you.

818
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,100
Like all right so there are two gay guys
who like had Ted Cruz over just like

819
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:52,460
chat with him, right? Cause he's like
running for president, you know, whatever.

820
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,840
And these guys were targeted by all of
these like gay social justice warrior

821
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:57,940
types being like,
just for talk,

822
00:42:57,941 --> 00:42:59,790
just for talking to him
like you're mainstreaming,

823
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,980
his auntie gave you and like how are we
supposed to persuade people of our views

824
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,350
if we can't even like talk to them,
you know what I mean?

825
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,070
Like how is that supposed to work?
I'm on a bunch of block lists.

826
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,780
I'm on block lists,
social justice and what I've done,

827
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,040
but they're all going to
figure out what I did.

828
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,540
They're all watching your stuff though.

829
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:19,190
This is the weirdest
thing like they block you.

830
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:22,020
And then they all like freak out if
you say something like incendiary,

831
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:27,490
but it's like Cindy Arie stuff primarily
supportive of almost all the things

832
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:29,570
that they're supportive of,
which I think is funny,

833
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,380
but I'm mock male feminists the same way.
A mock like males,

834
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:37,790
like social justice warriors because
I didn't know what your doing. Okay.

835
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:40,640
Like if it's a play for pussy.
Exactly.

836
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:45,350
It's a power grab for Social
Brownie points. That's what it is.

837
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,453
That's primary.

838
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,930
I went to this one guy's Twitter page
and it sets the quote was something like

839
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:55,220
aggressively feminists or
fiercely feminist to like,

840
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:00,020
God damn it son, you need to lift weights.
You need to fucking eat some meat.

841
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:03,650
You need to do some squats. You need
to be, you need to go run a marathon.

842
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:06,680
You need to do something difficult.
It's depressing how Beta,

843
00:44:06,681 --> 00:44:10,070
so many of them are going to man up
and you don't, you don't, by the way,

844
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:12,320
you don't have to be Alpha
and you want to be Beta.

845
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:14,360
There's nothing wrong with that
or that's trends that are Beta.

846
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,930
Brian Redman is pretty God Damn Beta. You
know, he's one of my best friends. Sure.

847
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:22,800
I have a lot of friends that are like
feminine or were like less aggressive.

848
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:27,260
There's nothing. We'll just go do shit,
just go do shit with that. What I'm,

849
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:31,410
what I'm saying is like this attitude and
this aggression that they have towards

850
00:44:31,411 --> 00:44:32,490
things masculine,

851
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:36,690
they're sexist. Well like for me that
the line was crossed, like all right,

852
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:40,130
so I knew the rolling stone thing was
a hoax. Like I was like the first part.

853
00:44:40,131 --> 00:44:43,500
Explain to people who might not be
aware of what this was one of the first

854
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:45,090
people that did this.
I was calling bullshit.

855
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:46,880
Like it's one of the reasons
why I wanted you on the show.

856
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,370
And then one of the things that I did
was I called up some people at the

857
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:52,810
fraternity and just seemed like an
obvious thing to do and I was like, yeah,

858
00:44:52,811 --> 00:44:55,070
it was there. A party. All right,

859
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,030
so there's a story that runs in Rolling
Stone magazine and what happens is that

860
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,350
it's basically this,
this story,

861
00:45:01,351 --> 00:45:04,860
it's written by this woman Sabrina Reuben
Eardley and the story is about a gang

862
00:45:04,861 --> 00:45:09,420
rape. Like a brutal gang rape that occurs
at, um, at Uva, university of Virginia.

863
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:14,700
And basically the story has an anecdote
in there about this girl Jackie,

864
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:18,270
who is like apparently raped by like if
he was either like five guys or seven

865
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:18,631
guys.

866
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:22,590
And this anecdote was like such a big
deal among like the rape activist types

867
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,230
that it was actually used by this chick,
Emily Renda who's he?

868
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:26,760
UVA former UVA student.

869
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,430
And it was like used before it was
testified before Congress. So it was like,

870
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:33,360
you know, under oath, like brought into
the congressional record and I was just,

871
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:34,530
you know, the, the,

872
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:38,970
the gang rape was so ridiculous to me
because it was apparently like over hours

873
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:41,970
and I was like, what college dude
has like the stamina to go for hours.

874
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:43,260
So that was like the first,
no,

875
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:45,780
I mean like legit that like that
was like the first tip off to me.

876
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,110
And then the other thing too
was it was like so graphics,

877
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:51,000
so violent and it was like apparently
at a party. So I was like, all right,

878
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:53,640
there's a lot of stuff here that you
can just kind of like tease apart.

879
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,280
And then what happened was I
figured out the girl's name,

880
00:45:56,281 --> 00:46:00,240
like I went through and researched like,
you know, talk to some people at Uva. Um,

881
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,090
got like a list of all the kind of campus
feminist and kind of just caught cross

882
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:05,450
referenced it. It's been a long
time kind of finding it. And anyway,

883
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:10,140
it's a founder name, you know, his name's
Jackie Coakley. Um, and I was like,

884
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,910
I published the name of her and I knew
that all these people would freak out on

885
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:19,410
Twitter about it and like freak out in
the media but something like 150 to 200

886
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:23,370
newspapers so that I outdid a rape victim.
And like my own mother called me up,

887
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:27,240
like complaining about it. And
I was like, mom, like, trust me,

888
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:30,090
like this is not what it appears
to be. Um, and the, by the way,

889
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:32,400
this newspapers still haven't like done
retractions or anything and these are

890
00:46:32,401 --> 00:46:34,620
like us news and world report.
I mean all these things, they,

891
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:38,820
and they all got me thrown off Twitter
for like outing this rape victim and she

892
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:42,150
wasn't a rectum, you know, it
was like the weirdest like posts.

893
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,830
You didn't totally know though.
No,

894
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,730
I did because I called up
enough people and I knew enough,

895
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:51,000
like enough of the details that the
whole story was like just falling apart.

896
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:53,850
Like there was no party that
night. There was, I mean,

897
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:56,010
she had a history of making
up other stuff in the past.

898
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:57,580
Like I talked to somebody,
she's like, you know,

899
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,950
who was like kind of close with her.

900
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,690
I looked into like the three people who
are quoted in the article who are kind

901
00:47:02,691 --> 00:47:03,840
of like anonymously quoted.

902
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,780
And then I started looking into more
and more on Sabrina Reuben Eardley

903
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,840
discovering that she'd gotten in trouble
for like faking stuff in the past.

904
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,540
And I was like, all right,
this is not, this is not legit.

905
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:16,350
Like this is fake when I'm kind of
stuff that she faked a, she, I mean,

906
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:20,430
I put up some videos on my side. It
got news. Um, but basically she, uh,

907
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:24,690
her very first story she ever did
for rolling stone was w was a,

908
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:29,040
an interview of some, a
profile of a country singer
where she got a lot of facts,

909
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,010
just basically wrong.

910
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:32,650
And then she started fabricating and
she's actually talked about it on video

911
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,070
about how she's gotten these things
wrong. And so she, like, she's wow.

912
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,700
She fabricated and shit and she still
got published and rolling stone her after

913
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:41,570
this was been correct. And this
was what, when she was a college.

914
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:45,100
And so her entire career basically
starts is winning the college journalism

915
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:49,540
award from rolling stone a while she was,
you know, at u Penn working with, um,

916
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:54,070
with a glass, you know, Stephen Glass,
the guy who was famous fabricator, uh,

917
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,060
the new republic. And she
basically, her college, her career,

918
00:47:58,061 --> 00:48:01,540
her entire life is as at rolling stone.

919
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,110
And she was talking about things like
how she likes to shop around for victims.

920
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,320
I mean, these are like verbatim quotes,
how she has a good bs detector. I mean,

921
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:12,050
go and watch the videos. You mean not put
them all online on Youtube and they're,

922
00:48:12,051 --> 00:48:16,810
they're kind of wild.
It's such a fucking explosive subject.

923
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:21,610
It's so dangerous because real
gang rapes, real rapes, excuse me,

924
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,750
are horrific. They're terrifying.
It's disgusting. I totally agree.

925
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,380
Humanization that can be
eradicated from societal fact.

926
00:48:29,381 --> 00:48:33,160
Many of the women who helped me on this
stuff like are victims of sexual assault

927
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,900
because they're so disgusted
with this bullshit. I mean,

928
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:37,360
imagine like actually being a rape victim,
right?

929
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,990
And then like having to deal with all
these bullshit posers pretending to be

930
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:44,140
rape victims and imagine
how infuriating that is.

931
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:49,500
Theory and just hearing about
this [inaudible] rolling
stone failed every single

932
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:53,500
checkpoint of journalism.

933
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:57,550
They did no background
check on this whatsoever.

934
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,010
They did no vetting of the source.
They did.

935
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,650
And what happened was I
did violates journalists.

936
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:05,690
You see the movie almost famous and how
they had like the famous rolling stone

937
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:09,540
fact checkers. I kept wondering like,
when are they going to show up? You know,

938
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,470
like, when are they gonna like, right. Um,

939
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,340
but it makes you wonder about
like the whole publication,
other shit. Like, I mean,

940
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:17,800
I know Michael Hastings was a
great reporter and everything,

941
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,840
but people call bullshit
on some of his stuff too.

942
00:49:19,841 --> 00:49:22,690
And obviously we can't check
now because he's dead. Right.

943
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,380
But like you makes you wonder about all
the other reports that they do there

944
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:29,800
because if they're, if they're so
falling down on this one story, um,

945
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,770
and apparently like, you
know, she's gotten other stuff
wrong and other, you know,

946
00:49:32,771 --> 00:49:34,840
other stories as well,
not just the one I mentioned,

947
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,460
but like I wonder what their
standards are so lax for her,

948
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:41,740
what the standards are like for
the other writers too. Well,

949
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:44,860
it's always a problem when,
because of a salacious story,

950
00:49:44,861 --> 00:49:49,350
because of anything that's big and
juicy, you can become a star. Yeah.

951
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:54,010
Glenn Greenwald is a star and he's
a star for a legit reason. I mean,

952
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:58,270
what he did was a legit story. Totally
agree. Totally agree. He's a star now.

953
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,140
And so there's a lot of people that may
be less scrupulous that are looking at

954
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:03,010
that and they're saying,

955
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:08,430
if I can get some of that juice and if I
can find a juicy story that I can cling

956
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:11,650
to, I can also become a star.
You know, what's weird to me?

957
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:13,330
So like I like taboos like for me,

958
00:50:13,331 --> 00:50:15,340
like the whole point of being
a journalism or you know,

959
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:18,730
being in journalism is to be basically
tell stories that no one else will tell.

960
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:20,620
Cause first of all it gives
you a monopoly, right?

961
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,350
If no one's talking about topic
than you like own that topic. Right?

962
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,950
And then second of all, like there are a
lot of taboos and our society like race,

963
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,010
rape, uh, you know, military,
industrial complex, you know, drugs.

964
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,510
I mean you could basically,
you know,

965
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,240
figuring them a genetic differences
in intelligence. I mean,

966
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:38,750
that's a big one that we're not
supposed to talk about. Um, and for me,

967
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:42,800
like what's weird about this is that
journalism increasingly as used to like

968
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:46,000
justify the state justify
power, justify, like, you know,

969
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:48,440
basically to push agendas
that then become law.

970
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,180
And for me that's like kind of like not
the point. Like the point is to give the,

971
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:53,750
you know,
give the finger to the man.

972
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,290
The point is to basically be like
against the system. So like, you know,

973
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:59,690
I'm identified as being on the right
and I have some right wing views,

974
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:02,930
I have some left wing views, but no one
seems to like asking me about those. Um,

975
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,890
but yeah, I'll do the story's going
after like corrupt Republicans.

976
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:07,980
Like I did a story,
you know,

977
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,600
voter fraud within a Republican primary
and Mississippi there was like ugly.

978
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,970
But the thing is is that people want,

979
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:17,690
what they want is they want you to
reflect their tribal views and their

980
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:20,180
political views and they
don't really want the truth.

981
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,990
So like they will fucking hate you even,
especially when you're right.

982
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,590
So like for years I was talking
about this guy, Menendez,

983
00:51:27,591 --> 00:51:30,770
US senator who's going down
for corruption for years,

984
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:33,750
I was talking about him and I had all
the other journalists make fun of me.

985
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,020
Like you're just a blogger.
You don't know what you're talking about.

986
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,410
Even though like I won awards at these
guys competed for back in the day,

987
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,990
I just didn't want to be in corporate
journalism and even more cause I thought

988
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:45,680
it was too restrictive and
these guys are assholes.

989
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,960
Like you have so much of
the culture right now.

990
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:53,140
They just go after anyone that's new and
different and it's creating a narrower

991
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:57,800
and narrower and narrower space for
people to let their freak flag fly.

992
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:00,440
And I think this is really,
really dangerous for our society.

993
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:05,600
And we used to be a society that was like,
Yo, this guy, you know, he's, you know,

994
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:08,540
he's a crazy black supremacists, but
you know, he makes really good bagels.

995
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:09,920
And I kind of like go and
hanging out with them, you know,

996
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:14,210
like we used to be a society that was
okay with a little freakiness among people

997
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,400
and now it's like you all
have to think a certain way.

998
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:20,090
You have to behave in a certain way.
And it's like, what could be like,

999
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,010
what could be more like anti liberal?

1000
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,650
Like what could be more
like wrong than that.

1001
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:27,850
That's a very good way of putting
it. Yeah. I think that that,

1002
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:31,850
that tribalism things a real issue. You
know, that you're with us or against us.

1003
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,030
How about I'm just a fucking person.
I don't want to join your team.

1004
00:52:35,031 --> 00:52:36,290
I don't want to be on anybody's team.

1005
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:39,350
How about can we just be
on team human race? Yeah.

1006
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:43,930
Can't we all have our own
unique viewpoints because
we have a unique lives. We,

1007
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:47,570
we, we grew up in different environments.
We have different points of view,

1008
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,790
different genetics,
different life experiences.

1009
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,210
The thing that makes me the most excited
is when I meet somebody who like thinks

1010
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,910
something totally outlandish that I don't
know. And then I started reading it.

1011
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:58,400
I'm like, Holy Shit, this
guy's right. Like that's cool.

1012
00:52:58,401 --> 00:53:01,610
Like it's exciting to change your mind.
Like when you don't know something.

1013
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:02,444
It's exciting.

1014
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:05,390
And I always look for the people who are
like courageous enough to be like the

1015
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:09,750
Galileo is of our day. Like,
no, you're wrong about this.
And who are like, you know,

1016
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,580
sticking it out.

1017
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:14,240
I think people have a real issue with
admitting that they don't know something

1018
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:17,120
and a real issue admitting
that they were incorrect.

1019
00:53:17,121 --> 00:53:19,400
And their assumptions and some
people don't ever totally right.

1020
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,790
They don't ever admit it. They don't
ever say, I think I fucked up there.

1021
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,110
They don't,
they don't do that.

1022
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:27,180
They just because feel like somehow
or another that makes them less,

1023
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,300
they make like someone's
like, ah, you were raw.

1024
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,380
I think it actually a backtrack
what your Dick Tuck over there?

1025
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,630
Chuck get tucked on that subject.
No,

1026
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:39,300
and I've seen this like when
I say stuff on Twitter like,

1027
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:41,490
oh I guess I was wrong on that.
Like I guess I was mistaken or whatever.

1028
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:44,010
I think it gives you credibility but
all these people are like freak out and

1029
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:46,980
like you were wrong about this. Like
fuck you. Like did it. It was like, dude,

1030
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,770
like you're on Twitter right now.
Like you know at your mom's house.

1031
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:51,480
Like you know you're a Twitter right now.

1032
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:54,120
Like at work when you show you're
working and you're like bitching at me.

1033
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,360
It's like, what do you, what have you done
today? Like what are, what's the word?

1034
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,730
Ultimately though that that's a good thing
that this Twitter thing, I, I've, I'm a,

1035
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,330
I might be like too optimistic,
but I've been accused of that.

1036
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,160
But I think that this,
the ability to complain about everything,

1037
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:15,330
the ability to interact with people
instantaneously is ultimately a good thing

1038
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,230
because, awesome. Totally agree.

1039
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:21,990
Anybody that's darling like you or
not you, but like anybody today,

1040
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:25,170
like some kid today can
just fucking fire up a blog,

1041
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,530
some 17 year old girl and just say,

1042
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:33,050
I am going to be a fucking journalism
journalists major and I'm going to be,

1043
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,920
I'm going to be a journalist,
I'm going to be,

1044
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,640
I'm going to make my own website that's
dedicated to news that people don't want

1045
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:41,460
to talk about and I'm gonna try to uncover
things and you could do that. Yeah,

1046
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:45,090
it's fucking awesome. It's like the
coolest thing ever. And I mean like,

1047
00:54:45,091 --> 00:54:48,210
like I was at the Wall Street Journal
editorial page I like was in the News Corp

1048
00:54:48,211 --> 00:54:49,980
You Fox News,
evil empire thing.

1049
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,620
I worked for all these different
publications because my face got it.

1050
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:55,260
She was like, I knew shit. Like I
started on my career and I was like,

1051
00:54:55,261 --> 00:54:57,720
nobody knows anything about journalism
and the right for as many publications I

1052
00:54:57,721 --> 00:54:58,470
can,

1053
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:01,110
I'm going to go out there and just like
how all sorts of crazy wild experiences.

1054
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:03,150
And then it became clear to me that like,
Holy Shit,

1055
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:05,550
like I could run my own website,
I could hire people,

1056
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,770
I could like pay people for information.

1057
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:11,640
I could basically like do what I want to
do and I could have more impact than if

1058
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,570
I did like the corporate,

1059
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,470
the corporate route where I basically
have to pay your dues and get coffee and

1060
00:55:16,471 --> 00:55:19,530
you know, basically be like a
cog in the machine. And yeah,

1061
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:22,910
this is like revolutionary the fact
that like when 140 characters, you know,

1062
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,600
you can basically, I mean
I posted documents that
showed that people are lying,

1063
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:31,140
you know, in real time while they're
talking on Fox News, I posted stuff like,

1064
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,760
I exposed this chick Elizabeth though
baggy who was like the face of going to

1065
00:55:35,761 --> 00:55:40,350
war in Syria. She like wrote a Wall Street
Journal op Ed Column, uh, saying that,

1066
00:55:40,351 --> 00:55:42,570
you know, there are all these moderates
there, we should arm them in Syria.

1067
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,650
I proved that she was being paid by the
Syrian rebels and she faked her phd and

1068
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:48,030
like became like a whole scandal.

1069
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:51,120
It led to all this stuff and I did
that like with Twitter and like fucking

1070
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:55,230
around on the Internet and like that
is so cool and so revolutionary.

1071
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:56,850
The scary thing to me though,
right,

1072
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:00,990
it's like the combination of like
using Twitter and using like the mob,

1073
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:04,380
the flash mob stuff like in Baltimore.
That to me is like,

1074
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:06,930
the real question is like,
is the crowd like, you know,

1075
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:10,470
as the crowd going to do good things
like are we gonna use crowds to like,

1076
00:56:10,471 --> 00:56:12,810
you know,
solve major social problems?

1077
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,950
Are we going to use them like for as
terrorist operations that basically spill

1078
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:20,700
out into the real world. And I think it's
probably both. There's definitely both.

1079
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,160
But I think that
ultimately information and

1080
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,600
the access to information is what kind
of sets everything free because you, you,

1081
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:33,250
you get a, an accurate, clear
understanding of what's going on.

1082
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:37,360
There's going to be some
deception is going to be some,
some confusion initially,

1083
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:42,220
but I think we're, we're in
this trend as a, as a society,

1084
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:43,840
as a race,
the human race,

1085
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:48,841
we're in this trend of
expressing ourselves in a much
easier way and a much more

1086
00:56:49,391 --> 00:56:53,980
instantaneous way than anybody's ever
had the ability to do ever by far.

1087
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:59,190
It's one thing we can pretty much say
for a fact as long as we've known about

1088
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:01,720
people and the things that
people have written down,

1089
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:03,820
no one's been able to communicate
the weather able to today.

1090
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:09,090
And if you look at the slow progression
of culture from the dark ages to today,

1091
00:57:09,671 --> 00:57:12,910
well what is accentuated that progression?
What has it been about?

1092
00:57:12,911 --> 00:57:17,180
It's been about information. It's been
about education and ambition, freeing,

1093
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:20,530
freeing information,
expressing yourself and,

1094
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:25,090
and people debating these ideas of
expression with now with facts also,

1095
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:28,390
like someone could say, you know, you can
say something on a podcast, someone say,

1096
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:30,160
well,
you know what actually that's not true.

1097
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:33,460
Here's a link and you go to that
link and they go, Whoa, oh shit,

1098
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:36,430
I didn't know that that's happened
on this podcast a hundred times.

1099
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,110
No Dude, I love that. Like to me,

1100
00:57:38,111 --> 00:57:42,070
like to me the most exciting thing is
when I got a reader who comes forward and

1101
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:45,850
like has information that nobody else
has had, right? Who's like a stockbroker.

1102
00:57:45,851 --> 00:57:49,300
Like I have a lot of like stay at home
moms who work with me on stuff because

1103
00:57:49,301 --> 00:57:51,400
like, you know, their kids are
sleeping and they're like fuck it.

1104
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:55,480
Like let's Kezar evolution on Twitter.
You know, like that is so exciting to me.

1105
00:57:55,750 --> 00:58:00,040
And like when I learned stuff that like
totally up ends how I thought about x or

1106
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:03,610
y, it's like, it's cool. You know, like
the way, the way I thought about this,

1107
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:05,560
there's this essay like I
highly recommend called a,

1108
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,400
what you can't say it's by this Guy
Paul Graham. And he talks about like,

1109
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,000
you know how like if we think about like
fashion, right? Fashion comes in and out,

1110
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,340
we have moral fashions to,
right?

1111
00:58:15,341 --> 00:58:18,610
And what he says is like anytime something
says somebody says that's racist,

1112
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:21,310
that sex is something ist,
right? Capitalist, whatever.

1113
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:24,850
They're just reflecting the
taboo of their time, you know,

1114
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:29,830
that's McCarthy or whatever. And he's
like, the most powerful argument against,

1115
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:32,590
you know, against something is
that it's false. It's bullshit.

1116
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,280
And if you can figure out,
like you can basically check yourself,

1117
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:39,670
like I believe x about something,
you can check yourself and you'd be like,

1118
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:43,540
is this true or not?
And if it's not true,

1119
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:45,510
then like you gotta have
some soul searching.

1120
00:58:45,511 --> 00:58:48,550
You got to be honest enough to be
like, Hey, I might be wrong about this.

1121
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,170
Or maybe there's just
not enough information.

1122
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:53,140
Maybe I'm just going to have to like,
you know, keep studying on this.

1123
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,330
You know what I mean?
And I think a lot of people just want to,

1124
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:59,050
they want to join their gang on Twitter
or in like real, the real world,

1125
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:01,870
like in Baltimore and they
want to go in like, you know,

1126
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:05,980
basically be led by somebody. And to me
that's like such an elite liberal thing.

1127
00:59:05,981 --> 00:59:07,390
It's such a dangerous thing,

1128
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,080
but I think it's ultimately such a human
thing that it's kind of scary, you know?

1129
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:12,070
It's kind of probably why it takes off.

1130
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:16,060
Well, it's, it's also exciting. Yeah.
I mean if you want to go to Ferguson,

1131
00:59:16,061 --> 00:59:20,020
and that's one of the things that
I thought was hilarious was, uh,

1132
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,220
this black eye on Twitter

1133
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,260
row that the thing that scares me more
than the cops in Ferguson is all these

1134
00:59:27,261 --> 00:59:31,400
white dudes that don't live here,
that come down here, that are yelling,

1135
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:35,180
fuck the police and that,
that are trying to get like,

1136
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,220
you know what we're talking
about social and Brownie points.

1137
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:38,360
It's to a rock concert that was,

1138
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:42,890
that there's a certain sense of like
how fun it is to be a part of something

1139
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:46,760
crazy. Yeah. Right. Like, but
we've all met those dudes to those,

1140
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:51,790
those dudes that try so hard and you
know that there's some insincerity that's

1141
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:56,140
attached to and they know that if they
go there and they put that backpack on,

1142
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,820
they put their fucking sock
beanie on and they, you know,

1143
00:59:58,821 --> 01:00:02,690
yell out all the right things and get
the right fucking youtube videos up.

1144
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:05,900
It'll make it look like they're socially
progressive and they're a part of the

1145
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:09,410
solution. No true. But you know, we had
that sort of on our side, like we've been,

1146
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:12,170
yeah know, probably been to
sporting events or fights
or whatever where you like,

1147
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:15,410
you feel yourself like kind
of overcome by, you know,

1148
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:20,150
like how violent it is or how exciting it
is or whatever. And like you, you know,

1149
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:22,970
it's part of the human nature to
like want to belong to something.

1150
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:26,150
And I don't blame them for that. I just
think they're like stupid. You know,

1151
01:00:26,151 --> 01:00:28,370
like it's just,
it needs to be called out on it.

1152
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,920
And that's what's going
on with this is this,

1153
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:34,490
this age of communication that we're
in right now. It's there. You can,

1154
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:39,170
you can expose.
The hypocrisy is you can expose anybody.

1155
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,180
Anytime you run into
someone that's never wrong.

1156
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:45,320
When you were running into a liar,
it was like people wrong.

1157
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,870
If they make mistakes,
they're incorrect and their assumptions.

1158
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:50,540
It's just a part of being a person.
To me that's like the most fun though.

1159
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:52,430
It's like when you're,
when you're like,

1160
01:00:52,431 --> 01:00:55,580
when you think something so profound
like to me like to be a writer,

1161
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:58,610
to be a journalist, it's like, it's like
an adventure. It's like a quest, you know?

1162
01:00:58,611 --> 01:01:01,370
Like I, you know, I don't mean
to be like too nerdy on this,

1163
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:05,870
but like you go on this adventure where
you like arrive at something approaching

1164
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:09,890
truth and you arrive at like not knowing
shit that you didn't know before and

1165
01:01:09,891 --> 01:01:11,690
some of that stuff can
like toppled governments.

1166
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:13,610
It can cause elections to change.
I mean it can,

1167
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:16,130
like you can be pretty revolutionary.
Now,

1168
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,100
let me bring you back to this UVA thing.
Sure.

1169
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:23,570
So you were the first guy calling bullshit
on this or one of the first people.

1170
01:01:23,571 --> 01:01:25,430
I'm sure there's probably, there's
probably like two others. Yeah.

1171
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:29,030
And then all of a sudden, you
know, you get kicked off Twitter,

1172
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,450
people are super angry at you. Your
own mother is saying, what do you do?

1173
01:01:32,451 --> 01:01:34,100
An outing rape victims.

1174
01:01:34,101 --> 01:01:37,520
And did you question your conviction?

1175
01:01:37,521 --> 01:01:40,970
Did you question whether or not you were
correct about it? See, the thing is,

1176
01:01:40,971 --> 01:01:44,450
is that like I know enough about how the
media works that I know that like they

1177
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:47,900
need villains, right? Like
all of the media, basically
their heroes and villains,

1178
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:51,260
just like total morality play, even
though my boys are the ultimate villain.

1179
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:53,570
So like Frat boys,
the military,

1180
01:01:53,571 --> 01:01:55,580
I mean depending on what kind
of story you're writing in,

1181
01:01:55,581 --> 01:01:58,340
the military is either to Hillary hero
or the villain, right? Depending, right.

1182
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,220
So I think human nature is
like far more complicated.

1183
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:02,730
I think we're both like hero and villain.

1184
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:05,690
Like this is part of like what makes us,
this is what makes us cool.

1185
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,480
Like as a species, you
know? Um, so like I knew,

1186
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,070
I knew that the whole thing was bullshit.

1187
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:13,580
I offered like 300 bucks to somebody else
because I wanted to go and hire other

1188
01:02:13,581 --> 01:02:14,414
researchers.

1189
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:18,740
And I look for people who like flout
taboos like to me that one of the things

1190
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:22,380
that makes me interested in people
is like when they're like, hey,

1191
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:23,161
everyone believes this.

1192
01:02:23,161 --> 01:02:26,910
I believe this and I'm right and
they're so confident of it. So anyways,

1193
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,910
so I knew that this was all bullshit
and I knew it was bullshit because of

1194
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:31,800
summary reporting.
I'd done some other research I'd done,

1195
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:33,180
it took me a while to like find the name.

1196
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:36,690
It took me a while to find out more stuff,
but I just started poking around more.

1197
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:39,390
And the thing is like, if you've
seen enough of these fake rape pokes,

1198
01:02:39,391 --> 01:02:42,150
his are enough of these fake like, you
know, race hate crimes or whatever,

1199
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:44,760
you develop this like weird,
I don't know how to describe it.

1200
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,310
It's like I used to play
chess all the time. Um,

1201
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,950
and you see in chess
you see all these games,

1202
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:51,660
enough times that you're
not even thinking,

1203
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:54,330
you're just moving the pieces because
you've seen this orientation before.

1204
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,420
It's like the same thing
with these fake crimes.

1205
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,950
So like I had enough information,

1206
01:02:58,951 --> 01:03:01,980
I had enough stuff to go on and I
have my intuition was like, you know,

1207
01:03:01,981 --> 01:03:06,450
my spidey sense was going crazy and it
became clear to me that like they need a

1208
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:09,000
villain in this story.
So they're going to look for me.

1209
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,940
But what it's going to do is it's going
to amplify the reach of my website,

1210
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:12,150
you know,

1211
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:16,080
gotten news and it's going to make it
so that they're gonna make me the story,

1212
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,960
right? They have to. It's
just the way the media works.

1213
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,220
And so I realized it's like a great
promotion tool. Like if you have no you,

1214
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:26,850
thanks. And then what I'll also do
is it will also bring people to me.

1215
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,050
So like there's a case right now,

1216
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:32,790
this kid Tyler coast in Arizona who's
like wrongly accused of rape and it's like

1217
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:34,410
a whole scandal and
it's going to break up.

1218
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,150
It's going to blow up like
probably over the summer.

1219
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,230
And what's going to happen is all of these
weird people are going to come out of

1220
01:03:40,231 --> 01:03:42,540
the woodwork and they're going to
start helping me on other projects.

1221
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,460
And that's exactly what happened.
Um,

1222
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,490
now how do you know that this
kid is not guilty of rape?

1223
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,700
Because they're all these text messages
and messages showing that the girls can

1224
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:54,270
aspire to set them up and it's like,
it's like pretty sick stuff.

1225
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:58,760
What was the one recently where a girl
sent a guy a message asking him to fuck

1226
01:03:58,761 --> 01:04:03,210
her in the ass? Oh yeah. This is the,
the mattress girl in, uh, Columbia.

1227
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,310
What a great kid. She is. She,

1228
01:04:06,311 --> 01:04:10,590
she sent text messages as guys
saved asking Facebook messages.

1229
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:15,000
So the, I guess he can't
fake them, but you could,

1230
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:16,230
someone else could have said them.

1231
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,700
Someone else could have gotten our coop
on our computer and typed them. Right. No.

1232
01:04:20,701 --> 01:04:24,030
But I mean like there were so many of
these messages like in the deposition or

1233
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:27,990
the filing that they, that they did
to sue Columbia, um, that it's like,

1234
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:31,320
it's kind of like outrageous, you know,
like some of the stuff that was described,

1235
01:04:31,321 --> 01:04:34,290
like the sex acts, like stuff
that goes, it's pretty like nasty,

1236
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:38,190
just disturb stuff. Like I'm not like
judging people's sex lives or whatever,

1237
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:38,880
but like,

1238
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,130
it's kind of not the kind of thing that
you would expect from somebody who was

1239
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:45,840
like, Yo raped, you know, that wants
to go and fuck her rapist years later.

1240
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:50,700
The problem with the word
rape. Okay. Um, rape itself.

1241
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,680
The idea,
when you say the word rape,

1242
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:57,750
we think of it as holding someone down
or forcing someone to have sex with.

1243
01:04:57,751 --> 01:05:02,190
Sure. We think of it as a violent act,
but there's a lot of progressives,

1244
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:03,430
I don't want to call them progressive,

1245
01:05:03,431 --> 01:05:07,200
but let's just call them social justice
warriors that are making these really

1246
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:11,010
ridiculous connections between
other acts and calling them rape.

1247
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:15,960
One of them is having sex while drunk
where two people consenting people who are

1248
01:05:15,961 --> 01:05:20,140
both the same fucking age have
sex while they're drinking.

1249
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:24,400
And the man is a rapist in California.
Occidental University.

1250
01:05:24,401 --> 01:05:28,100
I'll have that is Russell on the podcast.
I love that guys. It's fucking awesome.

1251
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:29,780
Love that guy too.
And you know,

1252
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:32,110
he was a part of this whole thing
while it was going down and he's like,

1253
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:35,380
this is insane. Well that ruined the kid's
life. Ruined the kids' academic career.

1254
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:39,580
Kid gets kicked out of school, girls
still in school and they just had sex.

1255
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,650
That's it. There's no, I
wasn't, I was at college,

1256
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:45,910
I was at Claremont Mckenna out here in
eastern La County and I wrote something

1257
01:05:45,911 --> 01:05:49,930
on my website and the school brought
me up before it has a sexual harasser,

1258
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,540
even though I didn't even
name my ex girlfriend by name.

1259
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:55,600
I just said my ex girlfriend's a
liar, like on my website, on my blog.

1260
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:59,100
And they brought me up before the sexual
harassment code at Claremont Mckenna.

1261
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:02,610
Was it sexual harassment if you
accuse a person of being aligned,

1262
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:05,140
didn't even use her name. No. And so what
they did is, so what I did was I just,

1263
01:06:05,141 --> 01:06:06,040
I just said,
you know,

1264
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:10,390
I wrote like my cheating lying
ex-girlfriend is reliable source as she a

1265
01:06:10,391 --> 01:06:14,530
girlfriend, which is to say not very.
And then they brought me up, you know,

1266
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:16,510
it was brought in actual harasses.
Yeah.

1267
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:19,180
And so what they did was they wanted
to basically investigate my sex life.

1268
01:06:19,181 --> 01:06:20,230
And so what I did was I had,

1269
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:24,190
I had every guy she cheated on me with
and I had them go and testify on my

1270
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:27,610
behalf. So like, wow. It
worked out. And you know,

1271
01:06:27,611 --> 01:06:31,180
like my girlfriend at the time who's
now my wife was like, this is crazy.

1272
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:36,130
Like this is stuff that's bananas though.
Like this is happening all the time.

1273
01:06:36,131 --> 01:06:39,330
Like my case is like, by no means. I
mean, I wrote about it on my website.

1274
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:42,370
Everything. It's by no means unique.
Like I can't even tell you how many,

1275
01:06:42,371 --> 01:06:44,470
since I did the Jackie Coakley Uva thing,

1276
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:47,500
I've gotten like hundreds and hundreds
of emails from people all around the

1277
01:06:47,501 --> 01:06:50,890
country that have similar, that
have similar like crazy. I could,

1278
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,270
I could basically dedicate,

1279
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:56,860
I actually bought fake rape registry.com
because I figure like they might come

1280
01:06:56,861 --> 01:06:57,910
in handy later on,

1281
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:02,970
but the problem is this is a sexist
thing that the men are always the

1282
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:07,110
perpetrators.
The men are always guilty.

1283
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:12,070
The men are always the ones that need to
be removed, locked up there, the rapists.

1284
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:14,950
And when you start saying that,
there was another one in New Jersey,

1285
01:07:14,951 --> 01:07:19,630
they're trying to pass a law saying
that if a man and a woman have sex,

1286
01:07:19,631 --> 01:07:24,620
and it turns out that the man deceived
the woman having sex with, they call it.

1287
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,510
I mean they're, they're trying to make
that rape when they dating, isn't it?

1288
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,600
It's like, well, how about
men raped themselves then?

1289
01:07:31,601 --> 01:07:32,800
Because we've lied to ourselves.

1290
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:36,610
Men will lie to themselves about wanting
to be monogamous with a girl just so

1291
01:07:36,611 --> 01:07:39,690
they can get, get her in bed.
We lie to ourselves about, yeah,

1292
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,490
I'm going to settle down with her. And
then if you decide, you know what man,

1293
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:46,840
fuck this, she's too, too much work,
and then you were a rapist. He lied.

1294
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:48,670
He knew he didn't want to be monogamous.

1295
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:52,600
What about like fat chicks that look
for guys who are drunk and passed out?

1296
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,250
Are they rapists? Right? Like, I mean,
what is that? They certainly are,

1297
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,550
I mean there's a lot of like you could,
you could start playing this game.

1298
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:05,200
Like in California right now we have
affirmative consent. Like that's the law,

1299
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:09,040
right? So my wife's means yes, if
my wife and I get drunk, right.

1300
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,740
And then go in like, you
know, like a bottle of wine
or whatever. And I don't get,

1301
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,300
I've technically raped my wife.

1302
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:17,580
Like that's how like wild
the wildest society you guys,

1303
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,350
even if you have sex with her and she's
willing, she's not able to consent.

1304
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:25,190
But you know, the whole thing, the Michael
Shermer case, do you know that whole, Oh,

1305
01:08:25,191 --> 01:08:27,650
a case,
he was accused of rape because of him.

1306
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:30,240
And a girl had had sex
when they were drunk and,

1307
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:32,300
and she did the language that she used.

1308
01:08:32,301 --> 01:08:35,780
He got me drunk to a po point where I
couldn't consent. And then, you know,

1309
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:37,970
there was a guy wrote a blog about it,

1310
01:08:37,971 --> 01:08:42,971
this asshole of social justice warrior
guy that's as a professor and they,

1311
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,730
you know,
the guys name got pushed out as a rapist.

1312
01:08:46,731 --> 01:08:50,870
I mean there were essentially saying
consenting adults having sex is rape

1313
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,730
because both of them had been drinking,

1314
01:08:52,731 --> 01:08:57,170
but the man was the rapist because men
are evil because it's sexism, it's pure.

1315
01:08:57,171 --> 01:08:58,004
It's totally,

1316
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:01,220
well that's why they're saying that guy
who's suing in the mattress girl case,

1317
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:03,530
uh, Paul like nuns, Burger, whatever.
And by the way, this guy's like,

1318
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,830
he's like a social justice warrior
himself. Like his mother's like, yes,

1319
01:09:06,831 --> 01:09:10,310
I'm leading feminists and he's the one
who needs to know he's the one being

1320
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:12,260
accused of rape.
And so he's like,

1321
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,410
you read the messages and he's like the
most like passive aggressive. I mean,

1322
01:09:15,411 --> 01:09:20,240
he's like the liberal, you know, I don't
pass in that passive aggressive. And so,

1323
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:23,210
you know, he's like, oh, I'm so sorry
that I don't like you kind of seven.

1324
01:09:23,211 --> 01:09:26,180
She's trying to torture
him using the system.

1325
01:09:26,181 --> 01:09:30,710
And so what he did was he said Columbia
and it was like, look, you know, uh, uh,

1326
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,150
title nine,
you know,

1327
01:09:32,151 --> 01:09:34,910
you can't discriminate against men and
you're creating an unsafe environment for

1328
01:09:34,911 --> 01:09:37,770
me here. You're saying you're
allowing my rapist. Yeah.

1329
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:41,780
This woman accuses me of being a rapist
to wander around defaming me even though

1330
01:09:41,781 --> 01:09:43,640
you found me guilty and
your bullshit kangaroo,

1331
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:46,070
I mean found me not guilty and
your bullshit kangaroo court.

1332
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:49,760
So they found him not guilty of rape,
like under their administrative policies,

1333
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:52,760
which by the way, those things are like,
they almost always convict you, right.

1334
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:56,220
So he's found not guilty and he
sues them and I hope you win.

1335
01:09:56,221 --> 01:09:59,930
It's like he's going after Ballinger,
the guy who's the president there,

1336
01:09:59,931 --> 01:10:02,200
he's going after the, um,
and this chick, you know,

1337
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:05,210
she was running around with her mattress
saying that her rapist was on campus

1338
01:10:05,211 --> 01:10:08,870
and he's dangerous to her back. Right.

1339
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:11,210
She was at carrying out and stuff.
Yeah. She was trying to like,

1340
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:15,320
is there like a performance art
piece to what a crazy bitch.

1341
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:17,870
I really do think.
I really do think that by the way,

1342
01:10:17,871 --> 01:10:19,460
like I think like legitimately,

1343
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:22,460
I think like Roosh and some of those
like men's rights people are like,

1344
01:10:22,461 --> 01:10:26,900
I'm not a men's rights guy. Like I, you
know, I'm a people's rights guy, you know?

1345
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:28,550
Um,
but like I think they're right.

1346
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:32,120
Like if you don't go to the police and
you go to like college administrator

1347
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:33,533
shoes,

1348
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,720
that chicks accused of rape by mattress
girl suing Columbia University reveals

1349
01:10:38,721 --> 01:10:43,280
her damning tax and that's
her. Yeah, that's wild. Wow.

1350
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:46,820
We're in this like weird states.
Kind of cute though.

1351
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:50,210
Like go back to that picture again.
Just kind of, she's wearing sexy shorts.

1352
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:53,510
She should want her legs. She's got heels
on or those heels. It's hard to tell.

1353
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:57,240
I think they're like clogs or something,
but she's got all leg, you know,

1354
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:59,690
if a guy was walking around like
that with those cutoff shorts,

1355
01:10:59,691 --> 01:11:03,020
he'd be like that. Gosh,
look at her. She's,

1356
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:07,490
her jeans are cut so low that are pockets
are hanging out underneath the gene,

1357
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:12,830
which is always adorable.
And she, yeah, she's hot.

1358
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:18,630
It's kind of off. It's kind of awkward. I
hope we didn't. We didn't mentally. Right.

1359
01:11:18,631 --> 01:11:21,150
Those aren't, those aren't heels
at all. They're like Birkenstocks,

1360
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:25,110
which is even more appropriate. It's kind
of weird though. Like, can you imagine,

1361
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,700
can you imagine being like a student
and being like accused of this though?

1362
01:11:29,701 --> 01:11:32,250
Like it's pretty wild. Like
it's pretty scary stuff. Well,

1363
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:36,360
it's terrifying that we live in
a terrifying age and look, kids,

1364
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,920
when they go away to college,

1365
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:41,820
they get drunk and they fuck and they
make mistakes and they have sex with

1366
01:11:41,821 --> 01:11:43,590
people like don't have sex with,
that's like the point.

1367
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:47,820
But here's the number one thing that's
fucked up about this idea of people

1368
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:52,510
drinking alcohol, having sex and
have that being raped or people, uh,

1369
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,470
being deceptive and calling that rape.

1370
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:58,290
You're just talking about sex.

1371
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:03,410
You're talking about consensual sex and
you filtered consensual sex into your

1372
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:09,140
these parameters and now you're calling
it rape and it's people fuck up.

1373
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,460
People lie.
People do.

1374
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:14,610
And that's how you find out who to hang
out with and who did not hang out with.

1375
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,760
But the worst case scenario that's
happening to these people because they had

1376
01:12:17,761 --> 01:12:21,180
sex with someone that they regret. That's
part of being a person. You find me,

1377
01:12:21,181 --> 01:12:25,590
someone who has never had sex with
someone they regret and I'll find you a

1378
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:28,580
person has never taken a
fucking chance. Yeah. I mean we,

1379
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,960
we have ex girlfriends and ex
wives for a reason. You know,

1380
01:12:30,961 --> 01:12:32,280
people out there in the world,
right?

1381
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:36,500
Like this is like part of life
boyfriends or boyfriends or X.

1382
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:40,800
Whatever's people fuck up man. You make
dumb decisions and you're like, oh my bad.

1383
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,870
Have you ever talked to
a girl ever that said,

1384
01:12:42,871 --> 01:12:46,380
every guy that I used to date was amazing.
They're the best person ever.

1385
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,880
I'm so happy I fucked them.

1386
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,290
To know that I've ever blown was
the best dude of all time. No,

1387
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:55,950
that's not nearly every conversation
with a friend who just broke up with his

1388
01:12:55,951 --> 01:12:58,860
girlfriend is bad and that bitch is
crazy. Right? I mean, how about this?

1389
01:12:58,861 --> 01:13:01,350
Every girl that ever broke
up with me was right.

1390
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:05,550
She was right at the tone because I'm
a different person than it was 20 years

1391
01:13:05,551 --> 01:13:10,290
old or 18 years old or 30 years
old. You fucking grow, you evolve.

1392
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:14,610
Totally adapt, change. So
this idea that that's rape,

1393
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:16,980
that's if someone's
deceptive or if someone,

1394
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,790
the one that drives me the most bananas
is the two people drunk together,

1395
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:22,200
two consenting adults.

1396
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,500
And then there was a whole feminist
blog that I wrote about that,

1397
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:27,810
that if two people are having
sex while they're drinking,

1398
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,230
even if a man is drunk
and the woman's sober,

1399
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:36,210
the woman raped the man,
which is just adorable.

1400
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:39,240
It's adorable. It's
adorable. First of all,

1401
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:43,200
it's not possible because there's not a
fucking guy on earth that's going to say

1402
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:46,560
that if a woman had sex with him
because he was drunk, that he got raped.

1403
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:50,040
It's like all those, uh, high
school kids, the other where they,

1404
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:51,870
where the kid is like 16,

1405
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:55,380
17 and he's like screwing the 24
year old teacher or something like,

1406
01:13:55,381 --> 01:13:58,860
is that really re like, I mean, I
know we're supposed to say it is,

1407
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:03,700
but like is it really as a joke that,
did he get his dick get hard? Yeah,

1408
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:08,580
he's all right. Emotionally. Yeah, he got
raped. But guess what? He'll get over it.

1409
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:12,160
Who Do? Zach Galifianakis has a great
joke about that, about a young man

1410
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:16,390
who died because he had sex with his
teacher and his friends high fived him to

1411
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:17,224
death.

1412
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:23,150
I remember there was a case
recently of that guy who, uh,

1413
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:26,800
he got in to teachers or whatever
and they found him bragging about it.

1414
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:29,530
That's how they like caught the two
teachers cause he was just bragging.

1415
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:33,220
It'd be Kinda hard not to like imagine
your 17 year old self and you got two

1416
01:14:33,221 --> 01:14:36,560
teachers at a party. Like it would
be hard not to brag about that.

1417
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:40,330
Me a 15 year old kid who got blown by
his teacher who was good at keeping a

1418
01:14:40,331 --> 01:14:43,120
fucking secret.
You're dealing with crazy people.

1419
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:47,110
You're dealing with a woman who is so
crazy. She's blowing high school kids.

1420
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,770
She's having sex parties and drinking
with high school kids and having sex with

1421
01:14:50,771 --> 01:14:55,000
him. And by the way, the ones that get
caught, how many of them don't get caught?

1422
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:55,621
Oh total.

1423
01:14:55,621 --> 01:15:00,520
And how many hundred of them are out
there running around below in high school?

1424
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:01,360
Kids right now.

1425
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:03,790
And how many people are really smart
and just shut the fuck up about it when

1426
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:06,700
they're young. How many of the boys?
Yeah, I mean the boys. We had this case,

1427
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:11,010
so I went to this prep school and
Master's, Milton Academy, you know,

1428
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:13,680
probably probably remember from
your last mass. Yeah. Milton mass.

1429
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:15,460
So scholarship winner there.

1430
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:20,200
And we had this like crazy case where
we had this chick who like willingly 15

1431
01:15:20,201 --> 01:15:20,950
years old,

1432
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:25,950
gave head to this guy who we on his
18th birthday and five other guys.

1433
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:27,640
I think it's like four other guys.

1434
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:31,480
And the school just expelled all of them
because of the Romeo and Juliet laws,

1435
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:35,350
like if you're 15 or under 16,
it's like rape automatically.

1436
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:39,910
And so they just expelled
all five of these guys. I'm
like, no trial, no anything.

1437
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:43,960
Just expelled them. Uh, was it, that was
an issue when I was in high school, man,

1438
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:45,850
I was,
when I was 18 years old,

1439
01:15:45,851 --> 01:15:50,851
when I turned 18 my girlfriend at the
time was 17 and her mother was worried

1440
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:57,280
that like what we were doing was illegal
and she brought it up to me that my mom

1441
01:15:57,281 --> 01:16:00,310
thinks that you could go
to jail for having sex men.
I'm like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

1442
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:03,610
Like we've been having sex for like
seven months or something like that.

1443
01:16:03,611 --> 01:16:08,110
Like almost a year. It was okay then. And
it's not okay today because I turned 18,

1444
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:10,870
like I was nervous. I
was like, I had, yeah,

1445
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,050
I remember who I had a conversation
with, maybe my parents, but it was like,

1446
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,580
can I go to jail? Like,
cause it's really kidding.

1447
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:19,590
Isn't that like an inherently terrifying
thought? You know what I mean? Like,

1448
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,330
so like they're all right, we
know this like genetically, right?

1449
01:16:22,331 --> 01:16:25,270
Like something like one in 10
people are genetic Kuk holds, right?

1450
01:16:25,271 --> 01:16:28,990
Meaning like your dad is not
who your mom says it is. Right.

1451
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:30,790
Because like it's not a cold.

1452
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,610
I thought a cuckold is like you want
to watch dudes banging your wife.

1453
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,080
I don't know what that,

1454
01:16:35,081 --> 01:16:39,160
I don't think that's kind of a cuckold
is somebody who doesn't want that to

1455
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,090
happen. Who was a dude who has
this wife go shagging on other men.

1456
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,060
That's a different situation. Maybe.
Maybe like, I don't know. I mean,

1457
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:49,240
but I know the cuckold that I'm talking
about might be another second definition

1458
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:51,040
that you're talking about. I
don't think I've ever, by the way,

1459
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:54,750
I only I've ever said that word. I've
only like a Shakespearian thing. Yeah.

1460
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:58,180
I've only read cock hold. I don't think
I've ever said it until this podcast.

1461
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:01,960
Yeah. But uh, and so anyway, so
don't even, so like one in 10 people,

1462
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:06,310
their moms or their dads or not hit her
mom says it is. Right. Because humans,

1463
01:17:06,311 --> 01:17:08,860
we know that like women
prefer the Alpha male sperm.

1464
01:17:08,861 --> 01:17:11,810
But Beta male to raise the kids because
the Alpha male will run away, right?

1465
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,470
So a lot of women we've seen,
like in fake rape cases,

1466
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:18,710
they'll go and they'll have an affair
and they'll say, oh, that guy raped me.

1467
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:23,150
Right? And we've seen this happen time
and time again and that kind of stuff.

1468
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:24,380
Like people lie about stuff.

1469
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:28,180
The thing that the people just me off the
most about the feminists are like the,

1470
01:17:28,181 --> 01:17:31,340
the social justice warriors is to
say what woman would lie about rape.

1471
01:17:31,341 --> 01:17:33,440
Like as if it's like some unnatural thing.

1472
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,500
Like people will lie about all kinds
of shit all the time for no apparent

1473
01:17:36,501 --> 01:17:39,590
reasons. I can't say things like
that. What woman to a crazy person.

1474
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,240
But one would lie about bigfoot.
What one would,

1475
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:45,560
would lie about Ufo is what woman would
lie about anything. Sometimes the crazy,

1476
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:48,140
but sometimes it's an a tactical
advantage, right? Like there was a case,

1477
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:51,580
we did it, uh, University of
Hawaii, there was this chick,

1478
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:56,570
mckenna facto is her name and she liked,
there are two guys,

1479
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:58,520
like one who lived in one room, one
who lived in the other, you know,

1480
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:02,060
like dorm situation and she liked
the, you know, the hot, you know,

1481
01:18:02,061 --> 01:18:05,420
football player guy. Um, and
he didn't like her anymore.

1482
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:09,770
He was like banging on some other chick,
right. And the guy next door was like, uh,

1483
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:10,401
you know,

1484
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:15,080
she fucked him to get him jealous and
then said that this guy next door,

1485
01:18:15,081 --> 01:18:18,800
like the nerdy guy next door raped
her and he was found innocent.

1486
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,341
He was like clear,

1487
01:18:19,341 --> 01:18:21,830
but he was like expelled from
school at the University of Hawaii.

1488
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,890
He had to like spend all this money
to defend himself and he was found not

1489
01:18:24,891 --> 01:18:28,520
guilty. You like, you know, one in
everything. But imagine like how,

1490
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:32,240
I mean that that's like a perfectly
human thing. Like who, who, I mean,

1491
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:35,600
who hasn't seen situations where somebody
will sleep with somebody else to get

1492
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:39,050
them jealous, right? Like this
is like how humans behave. Like,

1493
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:43,400
this is what people love to do,
things to get reactions pro or con.

1494
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:44,720
Totally pro or con.

1495
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:49,490
They love to do wonderful things like
bring you flowers to get a reaction or

1496
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:52,490
they look to accuse you of things you
didn't actually do in order to get a

1497
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:56,750
negative reaction or fuck your friends.
I mean, how many girls have done that?

1498
01:18:56,751 --> 01:18:59,210
Fuck her boyfriend's
friends when they break up.

1499
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:01,190
And that's how super common thing.

1500
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,790
I've had fucking girlfriends of x book,

1501
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:09,350
you know guys who are still good friends,
like girlfriends when they break up,

1502
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:13,100
come after me and I'm like, get the
fuck out of here. And I immediately,

1503
01:19:13,101 --> 01:19:16,010
we'll call them and tell them, dude,
your, your ex girlfriend tries to fuck.

1504
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,610
She's trying to fuck all your friends.

1505
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:19,720
Like I had a situation where
I had a friend who like,

1506
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:22,900
I dated the girl beforehand
and I was like, Oh, you know,

1507
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:25,820
my friend is actually better for you
than I am. You know what I mean? Like,

1508
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,110
so I was just like, all right, these
people should date. And it was,

1509
01:19:28,111 --> 01:19:31,910
that was a very healthy of you. I think
people, I think that happens a lot more.

1510
01:19:31,911 --> 01:19:35,270
Like sometimes you're, you realize
like this is not right for me. Right.

1511
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:38,720
It certainly should. I mean it'd be cool
if that's how it worked if, but you know,

1512
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:43,400
the only way that does work is if the
person is mentally healthy and not lonely.

1513
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,300
True.
You know,

1514
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:48,140
the problem is people get lonely and
they get sad and they get super depressed

1515
01:19:48,141 --> 01:19:49,790
at that person doesn't want
to be with them anymore.

1516
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:54,920
And that sometimes that sense of loss and
it's ingrained in our DNA because it's

1517
01:19:54,921 --> 01:19:57,800
how people stay together,
which is how people procreate,

1518
01:19:57,801 --> 01:20:00,680
which is how the human race expands.
Because if it didn't,

1519
01:20:00,681 --> 01:20:03,620
if you didn't have that sense of loss
when someone no longer wants to be with

1520
01:20:03,621 --> 01:20:07,220
you anymore, then you would have no
incentive to improve your personality.

1521
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:08,400
He'd have no incentive

1522
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,160
to get your shit together. No incentive
to be a good mate, no incentive,

1523
01:20:11,161 --> 01:20:15,000
just like hold the reason why people
have that feeling when someone wants to

1524
01:20:15,001 --> 01:20:15,301
leave.

1525
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:19,740
That feeling of rejection is terrible
because you're your body and your DNA is

1526
01:20:19,741 --> 01:20:24,030
telling you, hey fuck face, you got to
learn how to be a more attractive person.

1527
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:26,130
You have to learn how to be more accepted.

1528
01:20:26,131 --> 01:20:30,210
You have to learn how to figure out
a way to be more valuable to mates.

1529
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:33,600
And that is one of the problems
with social justice warriors,

1530
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:38,370
that same instinct to be more valuable
and better is what's leading these people

1531
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:41,580
to loudly proclaim that
they're fiercely feminist.

1532
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:46,620
They'll the go after men exclusively
not be objective about the situation,

1533
01:20:46,621 --> 01:20:47,610
not saying hey,

1534
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:52,410
you may be these two people got drunk and
maybe this girl had sex with a guy and

1535
01:20:52,411 --> 01:20:53,430
kind of regrets it,

1536
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:57,360
but and then in the guy didn't regret
it and now lets just accuse this guy of

1537
01:20:57,361 --> 01:21:02,130
rape because that's what they're doing
and stepping forward and proclaiming that

1538
01:21:02,131 --> 01:21:04,770
this guy's a rapist and
writing blog entries about it.

1539
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:09,930
All your doing is trying to set yourself
aside as being the moral high. Yeah,

1540
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,790
but you know there's a
biological reason for this.

1541
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:14,490
So like there's this great
documentary series from Norway.

1542
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:15,540
I know it's like kind of random,

1543
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:19,110
but there's this document it's called
like Javier Nasca translates to brainwash.

1544
01:21:19,111 --> 01:21:23,430
It's all free online. I highly recommend
it. And you spell it like H, j.

1545
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:27,880
E r n, a, Google brainwashed Norwegian
region documentary you'll find. Okay.

1546
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:31,690
Um, and what he does is he interviews
all these people, like horseplay,

1547
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:35,190
scientists and specialists. I'm like all
these taboo subjects. It's really like,

1548
01:21:35,191 --> 01:21:37,950
it's kind of up your alley. I mean,
I think you'd, you'd dig it. Um,

1549
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:41,580
but basically there's a section where
he talks about how men and women behave

1550
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:44,880
after they have casual sex. Both
groups will party to want it, right?

1551
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:46,740
Because of how we're wired genetically.

1552
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:51,120
But women tend to regret it far more
often than men to the social consequences

1553
01:21:51,121 --> 01:21:53,790
for women. Not just, not just
like the sociological pressures,

1554
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:56,880
but I'm talking about like biological
things. Because women, when you,

1555
01:21:57,090 --> 01:22:00,260
when you have sex with them, they,
you know, they, they get oxytocin,

1556
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:04,050
they get all the kinds of like basically
chemicals in their brains that make

1557
01:22:04,051 --> 01:22:08,410
them attach to you. I
Dunno, maybe, I dunno.

1558
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:12,990
Maybe. I Dunno. But, um,
yeah, this, this show,

1559
01:22:12,991 --> 01:22:17,160
I highly recommend it and washed it
just like 10 parts in the paradox. Yeah,

1560
01:22:17,161 --> 01:22:19,170
it's pretty good.
So anyways,

1561
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:23,520
what's interesting about it is this whole
like kind of like brainwashed kind of

1562
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:27,090
this, this kind of like brainwashed
culture. There's like a biological reason.

1563
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:30,150
And if you're a woman and you have
sex with a guy and you regret it,

1564
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,070
and then the campus
feminists come in there,

1565
01:22:32,071 --> 01:22:35,400
the social justice warriors come in there
and say you'll regret is actually rape.

1566
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:39,660
It's a very like,
biological thing that produces this.

1567
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,990
And then on the other side of it too,
you've got this other biological problem,

1568
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:47,280
which is that in all animal
species, right? Like rape, I mean,

1569
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,750
animals don't rape each other.
I mean, I mean, they do like,

1570
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,990
that's basically like the whole
point of the animal kingdom, right?

1571
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:57,060
So like you've got cases where males
among primates will go and they'll just,

1572
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:01,560
they'll rape some desirable female
because they're like the lonely animal and

1573
01:23:01,561 --> 01:23:05,830
the tribe. You know what I'm saying? So
it's like, it's like, um, in our society,

1574
01:23:05,831 --> 01:23:05,980
if we

1575
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,540
had some loser dude as a last ditch
mating strategy, they'd go and rape.

1576
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:11,501
And I think that's like,

1577
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:15,550
that explains an awful lot of like the
actual violent predatory rape that we see

1578
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,540
now, that kind of acquaintance rape,
you know, I'm writing this down.

1579
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:23,020
Gender equality. Parents love
it. They're all 10 of the parts.

1580
01:23:23,021 --> 01:23:24,850
I think they're like 30
minutes a piece or something.

1581
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:27,180
They're in somewhat in English,
somewhat in Norwegian.

1582
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,980
He interviews all these people. Um,
but the other subtitles is pretty good.

1583
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:36,430
The idea that someone could go to jail
for something like this or get their

1584
01:23:36,431 --> 01:23:40,040
life's ruined for something like
this, it's just so creepy to me. It's,

1585
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:45,050
it's so creepy that sexual attraction
and then regret it could lead to someone

1586
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:49,270
being accused of a crime,
especially a heinous crime like rape,

1587
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:52,840
especially in how much money you have
to spend. Less so like Alan Dershowitz.

1588
01:23:52,841 --> 01:23:54,010
So I actually worked for,

1589
01:23:54,011 --> 01:23:56,490
back in the day was accused of
rape by this like crazy chick.

1590
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:59,770
We're Virginia Roberts and he's been found
like totally innocent and everything,

1591
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:02,320
but he's a lawyer, you know, like one
of the best lawyers in the country.

1592
01:24:02,321 --> 01:24:06,400
He spent all of this like attention
and money basically defending himself.

1593
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:10,810
And that's like a terrible situation
because even though he's found innocent,

1594
01:24:10,811 --> 01:24:13,770
even when people are found innocent,
people still kind of wonder, right?

1595
01:24:13,771 --> 01:24:15,550
Cause you can never know
what happens with two people.

1596
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:18,580
You can never kind of get that back.
You know what I'm saying?

1597
01:24:18,581 --> 01:24:20,260
Like that's what makes it so hellish.

1598
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:23,620
But once you're accused of
something is as disgusting as rape.

1599
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,950
I mean it's very difficult
to shake that moniker.

1600
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,550
I gotta tell you there's a case right
now I'm in la that's kind of like getting

1601
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:33,310
some attention. I wrote about it a lot,
but there's this actress, Pauley Perrette,

1602
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:36,010
you know like the NCI s chick,
I don't know if you've seen that show,

1603
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:39,700
but basically a NCI as she's
like accusing her husband.

1604
01:24:39,701 --> 01:24:43,540
It's like this long drawn out custody
or long drawn out like divorce thing.

1605
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:48,550
And she's been using the state and her
restraining orders to go and hire people

1606
01:24:48,551 --> 01:24:52,060
to follow her husband around and basically
show up so that he gets thrown in

1607
01:24:52,061 --> 01:24:54,520
jail. Um, yeah, it's
like this whole thing.

1608
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:59,590
If you Google Coyote Shivers when Kelly
paret she, hold on, let me explain.

1609
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:03,760
Let me clarify this. So they had a
divorce, so like it was like 10 years ago.

1610
01:25:03,761 --> 01:25:05,530
He married this like hotter check,

1611
01:25:05,531 --> 01:25:08,560
I think she's like a Brazilian Brazilian
journalist or something and he's like

1612
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:12,220
moved on with his life. He's this, um, you
know, musician type, he lives here in La.

1613
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:16,450
And what happened was she created
this whole elaborate story,

1614
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:18,820
like as a tactical maneuver
in the divorce, right?

1615
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:21,490
That he like beat her and like created
this whole like, elaborate thing.

1616
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:25,850
She hired this Pi who's like famous for
basically lying and getting, you know,

1617
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:28,930
the evidence to help his clients. Right.
Nothing wrong with that, you know,

1618
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:31,000
in a legal sense, but in a moral
sense, it's kind of messed up.

1619
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:34,390
And his name's coyote shivers.
I've interviewed him a bunch of,

1620
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:38,740
posted some stuff and he had nine one
one calls that basically proved his

1621
01:25:38,741 --> 01:25:43,660
innocence. And yet what she did was she
hired all these people to go and say,

1622
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:45,550
uh,
to follow him around.

1623
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:49,110
And whenever he goes anywhere she'll
then show up cause they'll to,

1624
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,830
and then he'll be within,
you know,

1625
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:54,850
within the vicinity or whatever
and he'll then have, you know,

1626
01:25:54,851 --> 01:25:56,980
face a chance of violating
the restraining order.

1627
01:25:56,981 --> 01:25:58,540
So she got a bullshit restraining order.

1628
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:02,470
She hired people to basically track
this guy around in La and she's a star.

1629
01:26:02,471 --> 01:26:04,040
Like she's on the top show on television.
I've

1630
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,980
written about this. It got news. Other
people have written about this too,

1631
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,680
but it's like one of the
greatest like loss, you know, uh,

1632
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:13,760
a restraining order abuses against a guy
out there and this guy is facing like

1633
01:26:13,761 --> 01:26:15,670
30. Yeah, I think he's facing like a,

1634
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:20,720
I think he'd say you seem like a year in
prison are a year in jail for violating

1635
01:26:20,721 --> 01:26:23,600
a restraining order. That was like
bullshit Lee obtained and you know,

1636
01:26:23,601 --> 01:26:25,310
you could interview this guy.
Like I vetted him,

1637
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:26,600
I've had all these people look into him.

1638
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,420
Like everything he said
to me has checked out. Um,

1639
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:32,840
how do you know her interviewed
her? So, so I've got,

1640
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:35,810
so I've got a lot of the documents that
confirm what he's saying and no one's

1641
01:26:35,811 --> 01:26:36,591
really dug into it.

1642
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:39,950
So what she's done is she's used the
threat assessment office of the LAPD,

1643
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:43,100
which is like basically a bunch of star
fuckers. Like they love celebrities.

1644
01:26:43,101 --> 01:26:46,460
And so they tried to make it like this
guy who's also kind of like a minor

1645
01:26:46,461 --> 01:26:47,270
celebrity,

1646
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:51,560
they tried to use him and say like he's
a stalker or whatever to advance their

1647
01:26:51,561 --> 01:26:54,560
power and interest when it's really
just a dispute that they had.

1648
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:56,720
And they got into an
argument like is couples do,

1649
01:26:56,721 --> 01:27:00,320
he divorced her and he
then married somebody else.

1650
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:02,570
She was all like upset about this and she,

1651
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:06,740
she hired people to basically torment
this guy. Um, and it's like no,

1652
01:27:06,741 --> 01:27:09,320
that he wasn't a dick,
that he wasn't a beating or whatever.

1653
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:12,410
There was no record of that.
There's no record of anything.

1654
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:17,560
There was no record as far as her going
to the hospital or no record of like

1655
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:22,220
abuse, no record of like, you
know, of him hurting her in court.

1656
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:25,580
Actually they suggested that
he sat on her, you know,

1657
01:27:25,581 --> 01:27:28,460
but that the other than the court,
then the lawyer kind of retracted that.

1658
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,350
I mean basically there's no evidence,

1659
01:27:30,351 --> 01:27:32,420
physical evidence whatsoever
that he was like beating her.

1660
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:38,380
I have with that is there's a lot of
women that don't want to admit that there

1661
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:39,520
man beats them.

1662
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:44,020
They should freak out about it or there's
a mutually abusive relationship and

1663
01:27:44,021 --> 01:27:47,370
the man takes it too far and they don't,
don't ever go to the hospital about it.

1664
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:47,550
I don't think

1665
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:50,340
that's the case here. I mean, you would
have to drill down on the particular,

1666
01:27:50,341 --> 01:27:52,240
cause I've written about this a
bunch already. It's been 20 months,

1667
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:55,410
but you have to communicate with her. I
have, I've reached out to her. I've got,

1668
01:27:55,411 --> 01:27:59,220
I mean all of the documentation that's
in the case supports this guy's side of

1669
01:27:59,221 --> 01:28:02,070
it. And she has said
things that contradict the
documentation that's out there.

1670
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:03,570
Like,
uh,

1671
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:07,350
she said that she feared for her life
and she called the nine one one nine one

1672
01:28:07,351 --> 01:28:11,670
one call and I posted the audio of that
and it showed like she wasn't, you know,

1673
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:13,590
freaking out or anything.
She was very calm.

1674
01:28:13,591 --> 01:28:15,560
She was like trying to
get her husband right.

1675
01:28:15,561 --> 01:28:18,990
I mean there's a lot of physical
evidence in the case. You should,

1676
01:28:18,991 --> 01:28:21,660
I mean you could, you should. I mean
not to tell you what to do your podcast,

1677
01:28:21,661 --> 01:28:23,320
but he's somebody you should have on,
cause he's kind of,

1678
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:25,520
he's kind of an interesting
guy. He's been, you know,

1679
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:28,920
he was like a total liberal kind of
guy and he's been like dealing with the

1680
01:28:28,921 --> 01:28:33,480
trauma of this. Um, and there's,
I mean if you go to God news,

1681
01:28:33,481 --> 01:28:35,130
I've kind of written it out
and kind of more detail,

1682
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,020
but there's a lot of
evidence to kind of point me.

1683
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:41,100
I tend to be very suspicious of men who
are like accused accused of beating in

1684
01:28:41,101 --> 01:28:44,550
general because like, yeah, like a calm,
cause it's common like people do it,

1685
01:28:44,551 --> 01:28:47,590
you know, like a friend of mine, actually,
I'm not a friend of mine, but you know,

1686
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,810
like a Twitter friend of mine,
uh,

1687
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,890
Todd king cannon who was a famous kind
of Republican guy is wailing on his wife

1688
01:28:52,891 --> 01:28:56,330
for a long time and you know, was
apparently arrested for it. So like I, I,

1689
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:59,020
I don't discount that, that,
that happens, but the, the,

1690
01:28:59,070 --> 01:29:02,150
the evidence that's gone on here,
the number of, you know, um,

1691
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:05,890
different civil rights groups have got
involved in a number of researchers got

1692
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:07,410
involved.
There are a lot of people who are like,

1693
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:11,850
this guy could go to jail for a
year on trumped up charges. Um,

1694
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:15,810
and it's kind of wild, but, but again,
you know, you never really know,

1695
01:29:15,811 --> 01:29:17,340
like this gets to what we
were saying earlier, right.

1696
01:29:17,341 --> 01:29:19,530
You never really know what
goes on with two people.

1697
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,910
Right. Right. When he'd go to the
girl with the mattress on her back,

1698
01:29:22,911 --> 01:29:24,570
it's obvious that it does happen.
Sure.

1699
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:26,780
Obviously there's some people
that are fucking crazy.

1700
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:29,750
There's also some people that
want to do that Glen close thing.

1701
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:34,760
I'm not going to be ignored. I will
not be ignored. Like you, they don't,

1702
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:37,520
someone doesn't want you to just
move on with your life. You know,

1703
01:29:37,521 --> 01:29:42,260
some men and women women after
they just go crazy. Yeah.

1704
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:45,890
There's certain people that,
that feeling that they get,

1705
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:48,500
that we discussed before
when someone rejects you,

1706
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,530
that horrible feeling of
loss and it's like God,

1707
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:56,330
which is nature trying to get you to
do some deep fucking soul searching and

1708
01:29:56,331 --> 01:29:58,250
figure out how to be a better mate

1709
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,200
drug thing too, right? When
you're getting, when you're
fucking on the regular,

1710
01:30:01,201 --> 01:30:04,020
you know, you get certain brain
chemicals released, you know,

1711
01:30:04,021 --> 01:30:06,240
you feel good about
yourself, right? Like I mean,

1712
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:08,130
that's what the whole like
when you first fall in love,

1713
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:11,520
you're getting all that Aussie Towson
into your brain, which is like a narcotic.

1714
01:30:11,521 --> 01:30:14,880
Like it's uh, you know, it's an actual
like, and then when you stop getting that,

1715
01:30:14,881 --> 01:30:17,730
you go through withdrawals.
Right? And that's what you,

1716
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,590
that's why you feel like physically
like your body hurts, right?

1717
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:26,070
Like that's what that is and you've
got to go and build yourself up to be a

1718
01:30:26,071 --> 01:30:29,130
better mate.
But a lot of people unfortunately don't.

1719
01:30:29,131 --> 01:30:32,190
And then then the sad thing is then they
start using the legal system or their

1720
01:30:32,191 --> 01:30:35,670
power or their money or whatever
to then fuck with the other person.

1721
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:37,780
Yeah, it's dark, it's dark.

1722
01:30:37,781 --> 01:30:41,680
What people are capable of doing and
deception and the fact that they can plot

1723
01:30:41,681 --> 01:30:44,890
and conspire to have someone locked up
for something just to sort of have an

1724
01:30:44,891 --> 01:30:45,724
impact on their life.

1725
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,300
And I don't think it's like uh,
I don't think it's always an everywhere,

1726
01:30:48,301 --> 01:30:51,410
a malicious thing. Cause I think
sometimes you go, you just go crazy.

1727
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:55,310
Like I mean we've all had bad breakups
where we are like we don't recognize

1728
01:30:55,311 --> 01:30:57,920
ourselves. Like the actions that
we're doing like don't seem rational.

1729
01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:02,150
Well also there's some people that have
some sort of crazy aspects of their

1730
01:31:02,151 --> 01:31:02,661
personality.

1731
01:31:02,661 --> 01:31:06,530
They are attractive because they're wild
and impulsive and you hold off it when

1732
01:31:06,531 --> 01:31:08,060
you first start dating him.
You know,

1733
01:31:08,061 --> 01:31:11,520
like if you're dating a girl and she pulls
her pants down in the parking lot and

1734
01:31:11,521 --> 01:31:13,880
he's, come on, let's do it. And
you're like, wow, this is crazy.

1735
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:16,520
People are going to see us.
I don't care. Fuck me, whoa.

1736
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:20,360
That's a crazy bitch is going to walk
around campus with a mattress on her back.

1737
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:24,560
You know, like that kind of, and you don't
really think about it, you know. Yeah,

1738
01:31:24,561 --> 01:31:25,311
you're exactly right.

1739
01:31:25,311 --> 01:31:27,680
Like sometimes the things that draw you
to them or the things that ultimately

1740
01:31:27,681 --> 01:31:30,920
repel you from them. Right? Like
you know, my friend Tony's Arrow,

1741
01:31:30,921 --> 01:31:34,730
he says that that's psychotic and erotic
or basically the same thing expressing

1742
01:31:34,731 --> 01:31:37,430
themselves and just
different ways that like the,

1743
01:31:37,431 --> 01:31:41,540
the girls who are the most erotic and
crazy in bed or on their fucking bananas.

1744
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:44,680
Like he only dates crazy
girls cause they're fun. Yeah.

1745
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,080
I mean I got to tell you,
like said,

1746
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:49,370
I'm coming up with my two year
anniversary of being married.

1747
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:53,360
I got to tell you like the faster I got
rid of the crazy in my life to happier I

1748
01:31:53,361 --> 01:31:57,540
was for sure. Well, especially when you
recognize the consequences of that crazy.

1749
01:31:57,790 --> 01:31:57,910
No

1750
01:31:57,910 --> 01:31:59,980
financially like debilitating.
When you're,

1751
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:03,370
when you're dating crazy
people, they can't, it can be,

1752
01:32:03,371 --> 01:32:06,430
it certainly can just drive you.
It can be pretty bad.

1753
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,830
Why don't you just gotta be
aware of the consequences,

1754
01:32:08,831 --> 01:32:11,290
not just jump to the deep end of the pool.
You gotta share.

1755
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:16,390
Just tread slowly like dancing on
dynamite though. Like it really is.

1756
01:32:16,391 --> 01:32:19,100
And a lot of guys think like,
no, no, no, I can control this
shit. And like, no, no, no,

1757
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:21,250
no, no. Like there's a legal
system that's got to get you.

1758
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:25,060
Certainly if someone's
inclined to sue and my God,

1759
01:32:25,061 --> 01:32:28,030
I mean anybody that finds
out about mattress girl and,

1760
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:31,660
and then still decides to date or after
that. But what a glutton for punishment.

1761
01:32:31,661 --> 01:32:36,560
You must be. I would, I would
be fascinated to interview
that guy. Like I wouldn't,

1762
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:39,330
wouldn't, wouldn't you be
like, what would you, I mean,

1763
01:32:39,331 --> 01:32:41,020
what was going to be cooking at Uva girl,

1764
01:32:41,021 --> 01:32:43,930
let's go back to the rolling stone
sharing this because we'd never really

1765
01:32:43,931 --> 01:32:48,290
completely completed it. I'm
completely completed this. Um,

1766
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:53,120
you were the guy who were one of the
people that called bullshit on this. Yeah.

1767
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:57,550
And when it all fell apart,
which took a long time. Yeah.

1768
01:32:57,551 --> 01:33:00,250
It was a delayed reaction. Well,
like three or four months, but yeah,

1769
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:02,760
it took a long time. Yeah. I mean there's,

1770
01:33:02,761 --> 01:33:07,000
this whole thing was a huge
story and you know, uh, yes,

1771
01:33:07,001 --> 01:33:11,800
all women and all that shit went down
there that, that bothered me a lot too.

1772
01:33:11,801 --> 01:33:12,290
That was,
yes.

1773
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:16,180
All women than me about that that guy
killed more men than he did women.

1774
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:19,470
And everybody was like, yes. All
women. Like what does it need?

1775
01:33:19,471 --> 01:33:20,590
You're dealing with a psycho,

1776
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:24,460
whatever happened to just like plain
crazy like people are that are just nuts.

1777
01:33:24,461 --> 01:33:27,610
Like it's not even a political thing
like whatever happened to just like this

1778
01:33:27,611 --> 01:33:31,810
guy is nuts. Yeah. But this,
the whole focus became,

1779
01:33:31,811 --> 01:33:35,650
instead of his mental health issues,
does the guy in Santa Barbara,

1780
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:40,950
the for the focus became that this whole
thing was about men's rights activists

1781
01:33:42,191 --> 01:33:46,120
and pickup artists who have fucked
with this guy's head and gotten him to

1782
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:50,170
objectify women and that women have to
deal with this guy kind of person on a

1783
01:33:50,171 --> 01:33:52,000
regular basis.
It's just a nonsense.

1784
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:56,700
Completely ignoring the fact that this
guy murdered four men and two women and

1785
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:00,010
he stabbed more people than he use guns
to people who were trying to ban guns

1786
01:34:00,011 --> 01:34:03,100
doing that. But the whole thing
was just so completely fucked up.

1787
01:34:03,101 --> 01:34:03,790
Like how can you,

1788
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:06,670
and I saw that there's so many
social justice where he couldn't,

1789
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:10,870
one guy that I respect wrote this article,
this Hashtag yes. All women article.

1790
01:34:10,871 --> 01:34:12,460
I'm like,
Jesus fucking Christ dude.

1791
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:17,700
You're dealing with a person with obvious
mental illness problems and the fact

1792
01:34:18,071 --> 01:34:21,880
that you're writing. Yes. All women when
he murdered men as well. It's just crazy.

1793
01:34:21,881 --> 01:34:24,610
It's sexist.
It's fucking sexist is,

1794
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:28,120
and it's sad too because like there's
so many people out there who had lake

1795
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:31,730
legit and mental health issues that
like we shouldn't be putting them into a

1796
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:35,560
like, uh, into like a political
or social or religious lens.

1797
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:38,310
Exactly what you just be like, we should
just get these people help. Right.

1798
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:42,080
And we should try and identify them, not
give them guns. Right? Like I think we,

1799
01:34:42,081 --> 01:34:43,990
you know,
those of us who are pro guns,

1800
01:34:43,991 --> 01:34:47,380
we should recognize that like there's
the people who shouldn't have guns. Um,

1801
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,160
not that we should be overly restrictive
about gun Ross because I think a lot of

1802
01:34:51,161 --> 01:34:54,070
people in Maryland right now kind of
wish they could have concealed carry,

1803
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:58,160
you know, um, yeah, in
Baltimore or whatnot. But we
should be like, we should stop

1804
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:01,550
trying to politicize everything
and try to like help people.

1805
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:05,390
And the thing is when you start like
framing these things as political

1806
01:35:05,391 --> 01:35:09,860
discussions rather than like, hey, like
this guy's crazy, like we should help him

1807
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:12,500
and it's a power grab for
Social Brownie points.

1808
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:15,470
Is this God that I know that I respect,
that wrote this article.

1809
01:35:15,471 --> 01:35:19,350
He's a fucking Dork. He's a
Dork. And I've seen, you know,

1810
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:21,920
I mean I say that with all love,

1811
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:27,100
but he's just as super nerdy guy who's
very weak and this is signaling thing.

1812
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,730
Hollowness, peacock feathers. Yes.

1813
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:33,140
It's all, I mean this is where monkeys,
right? Like we're, we're like, you know,

1814
01:35:33,141 --> 01:35:35,200
we are primates or whatever
we want to say, put, you know,

1815
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:39,920
the Pc version of it all monkeys signal
like all of them socially, they, you know,

1816
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:42,410
that's what the gorilla does this for.
Like this is what,

1817
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:46,030
this is what this is and what
they're doing is they're using the,

1818
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:50,360
the taboos of the society to show to
women that they're virtuous and that

1819
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:53,590
therefore they're deserving of
female attention. And you know,

1820
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,860
they don't know that they're doing that.

1821
01:35:54,861 --> 01:35:57,890
I'm sure they see like a political lens
to it, but that's what they were doing.

1822
01:35:58,050 --> 01:36:01,290
Absolutely. I mean, this is
also, by the way, while heinous,

1823
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:05,460
horrific acts are going on all throughout
the world that these people are

1824
01:36:05,461 --> 01:36:08,880
conveniently ignoring. Like she's not,
they're not focusing on the Congo.

1825
01:36:08,881 --> 01:36:13,570
Then I focusing on, there's like a real
rape culture, a real rape called total.

1826
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:15,090
I focusing on Afghanistan.

1827
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:18,210
They're not writing articles and some
of the most heinous activities of the

1828
01:36:18,211 --> 01:36:18,960
human race.

1829
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:22,080
They're writing articles about this
one thing that's in the news and then

1830
01:36:22,090 --> 01:36:26,460
they're using it to focus on one
very specific aspect of that thing.

1831
01:36:26,461 --> 01:36:29,070
Not to mental illness as
the gender aspects of it.

1832
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:31,960
Easy man. Like I mean I watched all
these videos, I read every article,

1833
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,160
Sabrina Reuben early wrote like I watch
all the videos that I could find of her.

1834
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:39,450
I like, yeah, like it was hard to do
this shit. Like, you know what I mean?

1835
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:42,600
And it's easy just to be like,
yes, I'll live in a, you know,

1836
01:36:42,601 --> 01:36:47,340
140 and it's hard to go to like see the
rape rooms in like you know it and you

1837
01:36:47,341 --> 01:36:49,590
shitty countries. Right. It's
hard to get access to it.

1838
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:52,630
And then the people who do get access
to it, it doesn't trend on Twitter.

1839
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:54,070
Nobody really sees it,
you know,

1840
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:56,970
which is the sad side of
like our media landscape.

1841
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:00,350
What is the consequences for the woman
who was a false rape accuser? Well,

1842
01:37:00,351 --> 01:37:02,630
there's no victim cause
there's no real guy.

1843
01:37:02,631 --> 01:37:05,580
She pointed to write the
[inaudible] fraternity

1844
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:08,460
was vandalized. I think something like
$100,000 worth of damage was done.

1845
01:37:08,461 --> 01:37:12,000
Like people saw that as an excuse. This
is the thing that scares me, right?

1846
01:37:12,001 --> 01:37:15,810
This is like, I don't like the Hitler
reductive added Hitlarian thing, but like,

1847
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,050
you know, like the Kristallnacht thing
when people were like targeting Jews,

1848
01:37:19,051 --> 01:37:19,321
right?

1849
01:37:19,321 --> 01:37:24,321
Like there's a certain aspect of this
where like it becomes okay to hate certain

1850
01:37:24,331 --> 01:37:27,900
people and to be kind of, because it's
okay to hate them. It's okay to harm them.

1851
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:31,050
And we are seeing this with like,
you know,

1852
01:37:31,051 --> 01:37:34,830
attacks on the police in Baltimore right
now we're seeing this with a tax on

1853
01:37:34,831 --> 01:37:38,460
fraternities. I mean if you, the social
justice warriors are honest about this.

1854
01:37:38,461 --> 01:37:41,070
They say like, we want to destroy
fraternities in this country.

1855
01:37:41,071 --> 01:37:44,550
It's like bastions of male power, right?
Like that's what they're trying to do.

1856
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:46,740
That's why you saw it.
You remember that? Uh,

1857
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,860
like a video a while back at
Oklahoma where the, you know,

1858
01:37:49,861 --> 01:37:53,580
the Frat boys were saying some racist
shit. Like, which was like, you know,

1859
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:55,950
we've all been in environments
where people said Shit that like

1860
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,760
probably shouldn't be broadcast to the
entire world. Right? Like, we've all been,

1861
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,890
we've all been like, I'm
not saying, well, you know,

1862
01:38:01,891 --> 01:38:04,080
the Donald Sterling thing isn't,
he is a good example of this,

1863
01:38:04,081 --> 01:38:05,730
like a private conversation.
I mean,

1864
01:38:05,731 --> 01:38:07,470
if you can't have a private
conversation with your mistress,

1865
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:10,480
who can you have a private conversation
with the Donald Sterling thing?

1866
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,580
She's as Christ.
I mean,

1867
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:14,370
I had a bit about it in my act
because it was so ridiculous.

1868
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:19,410
He's asking her to not take pictures
of the black guys in the same sentence.

1869
01:38:19,411 --> 01:38:24,390
He said, I don't care if you fuck
them. The joke I had, my act was,

1870
01:38:24,391 --> 01:38:26,670
could you imagine if it was
the opposite way? If he said,

1871
01:38:26,671 --> 01:38:28,590
I don't mind if you take
pictures of the black guys,

1872
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,770
but I don't want you to fuck on. People
would be like, that's pretty reasonable.

1873
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:33,740
You know?
I think it's kind of how another,

1874
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:36,120
it's racist because it wasn't
one or taking pictures with them.

1875
01:38:36,121 --> 01:38:38,700
Like the whole thing is nuts.
The whole thing was nuts.

1876
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:41,880
They took that guy's fucking team away.
I think he did it deliberately.

1877
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:43,800
I have this whole theory
about how it's like,

1878
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,500
how was like an elaborate
play to like sell the team.

1879
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:49,710
I mean he increased the rent. Oh, if
you look at like when he bought it,

1880
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:52,830
he's not that bright. If you've ever
heard of the talk, he's a fucking billion.

1881
01:38:52,831 --> 01:38:57,680
He's a financial genius but not socially.
I'm sure. I'm sure there Kate. I mean he,

1882
01:38:57,690 --> 01:39:00,000
I think he got back with the chick too.
I could be wrong on that,

1883
01:39:00,001 --> 01:39:02,370
but I think he got back with
her. He should. You know why?

1884
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,530
Cause she's getting sued
by his fucking wife.

1885
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:07,500
She's losing everything that
she's going to be broke as a joke.

1886
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:11,700
His wife is going after money
that she donated to charity.

1887
01:39:11,701 --> 01:39:15,370
Like when she bought things with a
credit card and they can give away $5 for

1888
01:39:15,371 --> 01:39:20,250
breast cancer. She wants that money
to, she's divorces ugly. Well,

1889
01:39:20,251 --> 01:39:24,030
the wife has just going after this cunt.
I mean like this chick,

1890
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:29,510
like the wife is going after her
because she can and because she can,

1891
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:32,010
she can break her. She can show her. Yeah,

1892
01:39:32,011 --> 01:39:35,100
you might be able to fuck my husband
because you're young and pretty,

1893
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:36,390
but guess what I can do.

1894
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:41,280
I had lawyer million dollars and I'm
going to sue you into the ground and if I

1895
01:39:41,281 --> 01:39:44,820
lose I'm going to sue you for something
else and I'm going to keep going until

1896
01:39:44,821 --> 01:39:49,440
you got no fucking money. It's kind of
wild, isn't it? It's crazy to me. This is,

1897
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:50,700
this is our legal system right now,

1898
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:54,330
but I mean in some ways the legal
system is super important to have.

1899
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:57,750
It's important. If somebody victimizes
you, you have a, you have recourse.

1900
01:39:57,751 --> 01:40:00,900
Sure could. You could get that
money but you can get it back.

1901
01:40:00,901 --> 01:40:03,180
But those shitting get victimized.
She,

1902
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:07,170
she had a husband that was fucking the
hot young girl and buying or condos and

1903
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:12,210
Byner Mercedes or whatever the fuck
he bought or of Jaguars or Bentleys or

1904
01:40:12,781 --> 01:40:14,160
whatever the fuck it was.
But it's,

1905
01:40:14,210 --> 01:40:18,330
it's the whole thing is kind of hilarious
when it's all played out in front of

1906
01:40:18,331 --> 01:40:20,220
you. Yeah. You would think
it would be like, yeah,

1907
01:40:20,221 --> 01:40:23,910
you would think it was like a Tom Wolfe
novel or like you would think it's like

1908
01:40:23,911 --> 01:40:25,650
some kind of fun play or something.

1909
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:29,220
But I mean like with the Jackie Coakley
situation at the University of Virginia,

1910
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:29,880
right.

1911
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:33,120
I thought it was kind of racist that we
all like know Twana brollies name but

1912
01:40:33,121 --> 01:40:35,280
not Jackie Coakley.
Like people didn't want to name her.

1913
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:39,300
Well Tawana Brawley though
came out publicly. Sure. But
this is a big difference.

1914
01:40:39,301 --> 01:40:42,510
And then she did too. Like she
participated in, in a story. Right?

1915
01:40:42,511 --> 01:40:43,770
Like a lot of the Times that,
you know,

1916
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,740
if it was so important to
keep on a bit reluctant,

1917
01:40:46,741 --> 01:40:50,070
I mean she wasn't cold so we're
told now. Right. But like,

1918
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:53,010
I mean I'm sure there's some
power that comes with being I,

1919
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,070
it was brought up before

1920
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,581
Congress,

1921
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:58,540
like they tried to pass like laws based
upon this grow based upon Emily Renda

1922
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:02,500
who was her friend who apparently has
this whole other problem with her own rape

1923
01:41:02,501 --> 01:41:06,370
story where she was allegedly raped but
they're like conflicting accounts on

1924
01:41:06,371 --> 01:41:09,220
that. But like the thing that
bothers me about this is not,

1925
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:11,080
is not the girls cause I do,

1926
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:13,480
I think there something like
mentally ill with Jackie,

1927
01:41:13,481 --> 01:41:14,820
like Jackie's clearly bipolar.

1928
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:17,980
Like a lot of the people I've talked
to who know her says she's just not,

1929
01:41:17,981 --> 01:41:21,720
well the thing that bothers me is
there's this desire by a lot of like

1930
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,020
journalists now to go and shop as,

1931
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:27,790
as Sabrina Reuben early put it to shop
around looking for victims. Right.

1932
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:31,690
Rather than to like tell the
complexity of like, you know,

1933
01:41:31,691 --> 01:41:32,920
an actual fight that goes,

1934
01:41:32,921 --> 01:41:37,270
I mean what they do is they reduce people
to like characters in there like agit

1935
01:41:37,271 --> 01:41:38,650
prop play,
right.

1936
01:41:38,650 --> 01:41:43,390
Rather than like get into
like the motivations and the
psychology and they don't

1937
01:41:43,391 --> 01:41:45,940
really, like, they don't really
need to do the actual work.

1938
01:41:45,941 --> 01:41:50,290
They basically use the gang rapes or
the [inaudible] sensationalist things to

1939
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:54,470
basically push people
emotionally manipulate them to,

1940
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:56,830
to like advance an interest or an agenda.

1941
01:41:57,190 --> 01:42:00,790
And what's happening right now on
college campuses is there eliminating due

1942
01:42:00,791 --> 01:42:04,570
process rights for men? And like, I was
a nerd in college, like I'm a nerd now,

1943
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,490
right? Like nobody was asking
me to join a fraternity.

1944
01:42:06,491 --> 01:42:10,150
Like I live with football players and I
like, you know, I saw the progression,

1945
01:42:10,151 --> 01:42:13,630
you know, the, the procession of hot
women that came in and tried to fuck them.

1946
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:17,200
Right. Um, like I, you
know, I saw this, but the,

1947
01:42:17,370 --> 01:42:20,590
and I'm not like trying to like defend
some of the boarish behavior that like

1948
01:42:20,591 --> 01:42:22,210
football players and Frat guys have.
Like,

1949
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:26,050
we all know there's some stuff that goes
on there that's probably like probably

1950
01:42:26,051 --> 01:42:27,970
not the coolest stuff in the
world, right? Absolutely.

1951
01:42:27,971 --> 01:42:31,330
But we also know that some women are
attracted to Borsch men of course,

1952
01:42:31,331 --> 01:42:33,520
because those are, that's what I,
yeah, it was just good old war.

1953
01:42:33,521 --> 01:42:35,710
And those are the men that defend them.
And those are the,

1954
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:39,310
the violence aggressive manner,
attractive to their jeans.

1955
01:42:39,370 --> 01:42:41,920
You can't have a society,
you can't, on the one hand,

1956
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:46,960
have a society that tries to turn us all
into basically feminized men and then

1957
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:49,720
hope that things will work out.
You need burly,

1958
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:52,480
disturbed men to go and
break stuff. You know, like,

1959
01:42:52,481 --> 01:42:54,280
this is what you need in this society.

1960
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:58,300
And if you're just constantly putting
upon them and constantly, it's not gonna,

1961
01:42:58,350 --> 01:43:00,820
it's not gonna work out. Well, this
movie does not, does not go well.

1962
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:06,180
Yeah. Uh, this Uva thing,

1963
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:11,540
so Rollingstone publishes this store and
with very little vetting of the facts

1964
01:43:11,881 --> 01:43:14,730
and just violate it all the
laws of journalism, which is,

1965
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:19,800
it was so disturbing because rolling
stone is this iconic magazine that in my

1966
01:43:19,801 --> 01:43:24,801
mind is ultimately connected with hunter
s Thompson and Matt tie eat totally

1967
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:25,920
pisses me.

1968
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:28,710
They pissed me off when they put the cover
of the fucking terrorist on the cover.

1969
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:29,730
Yeah.
Like my sister,

1970
01:43:29,731 --> 01:43:32,340
my sister was there 20 minutes beforehand
and when he did that I was like,

1971
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:33,830
fuck them,
I'm done with this

1972
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:36,370
place. Well they didn't
just put him on the cover.

1973
01:43:36,371 --> 01:43:40,540
If they put him on the cover handcuffed
being, you know, covered in blood.

1974
01:43:40,541 --> 01:43:43,840
Like they found him under that boat.
Tarp. Yeah. That would be one thing.

1975
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:48,400
They put a glamour shot of him. Yeah.
He's a cute kid, you know, and yeah.

1976
01:43:48,401 --> 01:43:50,290
And then you had all these fellows.
This is what we're getting at. Yeah. I

1977
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:52,160
was like women boarish men.
Right.

1978
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,130
So like they were going all these
chicks like the free, you know,

1979
01:43:55,131 --> 01:43:59,030
Free Dzhokhar Siren. I have brigade on
Twitter who are like, oh, he's so hot.

1980
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:01,640
Like there are all these people have all
these chicks like high school checks on

1981
01:44:01,641 --> 01:44:05,390
Twitter who are like, oh, he's so hot.
He's so dreamy. He's all this. Oh yeah.

1982
01:44:05,391 --> 01:44:07,930
It was like diff of stuff like, uh, uh,

1983
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:09,930
I mean it just goes to show
you that women have, you know,

1984
01:44:09,970 --> 01:44:13,340
some women have no taste and
just fucking around, you know,

1985
01:44:13,341 --> 01:44:15,230
so I don't know that some of
them were fucking around though.

1986
01:44:15,231 --> 01:44:18,860
Like there was some stuff that was
done. Yeah. Like this is what happens.

1987
01:44:18,861 --> 01:44:22,340
He's an attractive kind of guy.
Um, but that, that pissed me off.

1988
01:44:22,341 --> 01:44:24,200
And then then with the
rolling stone stuff,

1989
01:44:24,201 --> 01:44:27,560
what I discovered about a
lot of journalism out there
that you see all the time

1990
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,260
is that it goes through
very little fact checking.

1991
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:34,760
And the Sabrina Reuben Eardley is like
a prime example of this. But we've got,

1992
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:36,380
there are many examples of this.
You could,

1993
01:44:36,381 --> 01:44:39,890
you can shoot down a lot of articles
these days. Yeah. Well you certainly,

1994
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:41,710
I can shoot down that one.
You know,

1995
01:44:41,711 --> 01:44:45,940
that that article is a rough one and
that that article being in rolling stone

1996
01:44:45,941 --> 01:44:48,500
was so disappointing to a
lot of people that it was,

1997
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:50,680
a lot of people canceled the
Rolling Stones Subscriptions,

1998
01:44:50,681 --> 01:44:53,690
I'm sure because of it. I mean it's,
it's one of those things where you,

1999
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:57,850
you're always going to have to wonder
about any scathing report that they

2000
01:44:57,851 --> 01:44:58,900
published in that magazine

2001
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:00,920
now. But you know, there's no story,

2002
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:05,630
there's no story without Jackie Coakley
talking to Sabrina Reuben Eardley so why

2003
01:45:05,631 --> 01:45:07,790
does she go and talk to her?
Because Emily Renda,

2004
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:11,930
who's like trying to push this
campus rape agenda story, you know,

2005
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:14,860
this kind of rape culture
fantasy. She was, she was,

2006
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:18,860
she was shopping around for victims and
there's no story without Jackie Coakley

2007
01:45:18,861 --> 01:45:21,380
and note, and she lied. I
mean, she lied repeatedly.

2008
01:45:21,381 --> 01:45:23,240
She realized about the guy even existing,

2009
01:45:23,241 --> 01:45:26,060
she hadn't talked to the photo of the
guy that she had seen in all these years.

2010
01:45:26,061 --> 01:45:29,420
Like there's just, I mean,
you have to vet your sources,

2011
01:45:29,421 --> 01:45:31,160
you have to vet people that you talk to.

2012
01:45:31,490 --> 01:45:35,510
And none of that was done because the
story was too good. It was too sexy. Well,

2013
01:45:35,511 --> 01:45:39,290
it's one of those things,
this story where you,

2014
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:40,843
you can't,

2015
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:46,340
you can't question a woman who says
that she was involved in a rape.

2016
01:45:46,341 --> 01:45:50,540
Because if you do, you
become a rape apologist. You
become a part of the problem,

2017
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:52,550
you become,
there's all,

2018
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:56,750
I mean you could talk to a bunch of
different negative monikers to it and uh,

2019
01:45:56,930 --> 01:45:58,010
that sort of,

2020
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:01,970
that hands off non objective
approach to one very specific thing.

2021
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:05,150
If you talk about a man who
has been beaten up, you know,

2022
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:09,440
and a man who is a violence has
been perpetrated on you, you,

2023
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:13,490
you can ask all sorts of questions.
But if it's a woman and it's sexual,

2024
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:15,320
why do you think, I mean, so
I've been thinking about this,

2025
01:46:15,321 --> 01:46:17,240
I've been having this debate
with a friend of mine, right,

2026
01:46:17,241 --> 01:46:20,630
about the Rape Shield law, right? Cause
you know, like in a lot of newspapers,

2027
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:22,880
a lot of newspapers do
this. Like, you know,

2028
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:26,180
by design they say like they don't
mention the name of the woman, right?

2029
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:29,900
Whenever there's a rape allegation, they
say, you know, this woman was raped,

2030
01:46:29,901 --> 01:46:32,330
she's turning 19 whatever.
They never tell you like her name.

2031
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,960
And I always feel really uncomfortable
with this because it provides a great

2032
01:46:38,061 --> 01:46:42,740
shield to do damage to
somebody. Right? Like if you,

2033
01:46:42,741 --> 01:46:45,650
if you don't identify the name
of a victim supposed victim,

2034
01:46:45,710 --> 01:46:48,860
it's an alleged victim. We haven't had a
trial yet. We haven't had conviction yet.

2035
01:46:48,861 --> 01:46:50,100
We haven't had anything.
Right.

2036
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:54,780
And when people we know are doing power
place to kind of like screw people over,

2037
01:46:54,781 --> 01:46:58,430
I mean I posted an article of 13 women
who lied about rape, um, or you know,

2038
01:46:58,431 --> 01:47:03,431
on my Twitter page and like I think the
rape shield idea existed like in a time

2039
01:47:04,951 --> 01:47:06,660
before kind of the sexual revolution.

2040
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:10,920
So it made a lot of sense then like
when a woman's virtuousness or you know,

2041
01:47:10,921 --> 01:47:12,630
not having sex was prized,

2042
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,070
but like we're in 2015 like most people
are having sex before marriage, right?

2043
01:47:17,071 --> 01:47:18,450
Like a lot of people,
you know what I mean?

2044
01:47:18,451 --> 01:47:23,451
Like it seems kind of weird that we still
have this thing where we keep the name

2045
01:47:24,121 --> 01:47:26,430
of the victim.
It's an alleged victim,

2046
01:47:26,431 --> 01:47:29,010
but they always pretend like it's a
real victim and we don't know that yet.

2047
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:32,250
Like there hasn't been.
And it seems like if we named,

2048
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:35,910
if we named the women,
you know, like, hey,

2049
01:47:35,911 --> 01:47:40,050
so and so's accusing such
and such of this crime. Um,

2050
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:42,870
and we just named them like we do for
attempted murder like we do for all kinds

2051
01:47:42,871 --> 01:47:47,220
of cases. Um, I think we would get
fewer of these fake rape incidents.

2052
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:48,200
But on the,

2053
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:52,940
do you also think though that we would
get few real rape accusations of actual

2054
01:47:52,941 --> 01:47:56,810
rape because women don't
want to be shamed. There's
some woman that's a shame of,

2055
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:57,520
of,

2056
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,940
of coming out publicly
about an actual real rape.

2057
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:06,620
It actually prevents them from going
after a real rapist. That's a fact.

2058
01:48:06,621 --> 01:48:09,020
So we're told, yeah, I mean
that's not, so we're told there's,

2059
01:48:09,021 --> 01:48:12,230
I mean this is let people
that have actually been
raped where it's totally fun,

2060
01:48:12,231 --> 01:48:12,801
they've been raped,

2061
01:48:12,801 --> 01:48:16,100
have said that they were reluctant
shock about it because of the shame that

2062
01:48:16,101 --> 01:48:17,600
comes on them.

2063
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:21,470
The shit that gets put on them because
of the situation where a woman who gets

2064
01:48:21,471 --> 01:48:21,891
raped,

2065
01:48:21,891 --> 01:48:25,550
it's very different than a woman getting
beat up or a man getting geed up or any

2066
01:48:25,551 --> 01:48:29,360
other situation when a person gets raped.
It's a shameful,

2067
01:48:29,361 --> 01:48:33,680
horrible feeling that this
person has to deal with publicly.

2068
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:38,750
They have to be publicly humiliated by
the fact that this guy sexually use them,

2069
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:43,340
held them down. It's not just
about a woman was assaulted
if a woman's assaulted.

2070
01:48:43,341 --> 01:48:47,040
That's one thing. And it is,
it does have to do with our,

2071
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:51,170
our unusual connection with sexuality.
We have this,

2072
01:48:51,530 --> 01:48:56,030
this thing about sexuality.
There's this sort of demonization and this

2073
01:48:56,460 --> 01:49:01,450
right. Women either had are whores or
uh, you know, or uh, or nuns, right?

2074
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:04,700
Or Saints, you know, like that.
There's kind of like this, uh,

2075
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:09,780
kind of like in the post sexual revolution
era where like not sure if w if women

2076
01:49:09,781 --> 01:49:12,420
should be virtuous,
if they should be the same as men,

2077
01:49:12,421 --> 01:49:14,550
we're not really sure what
to, what to make. I mean,

2078
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:16,920
I've thought about this though.
Like I would never shame a woman.

2079
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:20,160
Like if somebody came to me and they were
like, you know, I was raped, or like,

2080
01:49:20,161 --> 01:49:24,540
you know, my sister or friend or
whatever, I wouldn't be like, you know,

2081
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,520
shaming them.
I don't know that like,

2082
01:49:26,521 --> 01:49:30,120
I don't know that the shame thing
really is as true as it once was.

2083
01:49:30,121 --> 01:49:32,100
Maybe it's still there and
maybe you're right about that,

2084
01:49:32,101 --> 01:49:34,320
but like you wouldn't shame a curl,
right?

2085
01:49:34,321 --> 01:49:36,570
Like who came to you and said that
she was raped. You pick, oh my God.

2086
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:39,750
Like I'm sorry, like, you know,
anything. I can do a slot. Of course not.

2087
01:49:39,751 --> 01:49:41,880
But what kind of man would do
that? I mean, not to say that,

2088
01:49:41,881 --> 01:49:43,420
not to say that that wouldn't happen.

2089
01:49:43,580 --> 01:49:46,880
Well, this isn't a lot of shitheads out
there though. Whenever you go public,

2090
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,130
you expose yourself to

2091
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,500
all people and out of all people,

2092
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:54,910
there's going to be a certain percentage
of them that I love to use this term.

2093
01:49:54,911 --> 01:49:56,140
The 1% you know,

2094
01:49:56,141 --> 01:50:00,220
the 1% everyone always wants to use the
1% in terms of like the judges and the

2095
01:50:00,221 --> 01:50:04,390
bankers, but the 1% of people
are just fucking cunts.

2096
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:07,250
And 1% of men,
1% of women,

2097
01:50:07,251 --> 01:50:10,570
this is 1% one out of a hundred
magnified on Twitter, aren't they?

2098
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:15,460
They're magnified when you get a
public exposure to millions. Well,

2099
01:50:15,550 --> 01:50:18,400
if you're dealing with 300 million people,
the United States population,

2100
01:50:18,401 --> 01:50:19,240
whenever the fuck it is,

2101
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:23,530
you're dealing with 3
million cuts and if there's,

2102
01:50:23,531 --> 01:50:27,760
and if there's one in a million, there's
still 300 cons. Yeah, that's a lot.

2103
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:31,990
That's a lot. I mean one in a million
is a ridiculously optimistic outlook.

2104
01:50:31,991 --> 01:50:33,580
Of course it's way more than that.

2105
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:36,730
It's probably one in a hundred if you
get to be together with a hundred people,

2106
01:50:36,731 --> 01:50:40,530
especially when you add anonymity at the
anonymity that the Internet provides or

2107
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:44,340
you don't have the social consequences
of being questioned for your behavior,

2108
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:45,790
your tweets,
or it's like being,

2109
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:48,610
it's like being on the freeway
and being a shitty driver. Right?

2110
01:50:48,611 --> 01:50:51,400
Cause nobody can identify. It's the same
kind of thing. There's a lot of that,

2111
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:54,940
but at least they can see you and look
in your eyes and see your car, right.

2112
01:50:54,941 --> 01:50:58,960
Your plate down and gives us some jumbled
the series of numbers and letters.

2113
01:50:58,961 --> 01:51:01,870
It's your Twitter account, you're
an asshole on it, you know,

2114
01:51:01,871 --> 01:51:04,150
and you can do it anonymously
and you can get away with it.

2115
01:51:04,151 --> 01:51:09,090
So if you find out that someone has been
accused of something or some woman is a

2116
01:51:09,970 --> 01:51:13,060
crime, like rape has been perpetrated
against her, what's the stop?

2117
01:51:13,061 --> 01:51:16,690
Some anonymous fuckhead from just
harassing them and going after them.

2118
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:21,840
And a lot of people have like
made of, you know, they've made a,

2119
01:51:21,841 --> 01:51:24,910
a strong habit of doing that to
people. Yeah. Well let's take,

2120
01:51:25,090 --> 01:51:26,260
let's take it a good example.
Like,

2121
01:51:26,261 --> 01:51:28,690
so I was reading John
Krakauer's book and Missoula,

2122
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:32,110
which is like about this campus
rape phenomenon and in Montana,

2123
01:51:32,111 --> 01:51:34,360
University of Montana,
this is a phenomenon.

2124
01:51:34,810 --> 01:51:37,750
He says there's a phenomenon going on,
but he's at the University of Montana.

2125
01:51:37,751 --> 01:51:40,660
He lives in Montana. So I seen him,
he was just interviewing people,

2126
01:51:40,661 --> 01:51:43,990
but they're there like five or
six anecdotes of like rapes.

2127
01:51:44,290 --> 01:51:49,290
And one of the cases is this guy who was
a football player who in 2012 was found

2128
01:51:49,390 --> 01:51:52,480
not guilty of rape. It was like brought
before the courts and everything he was,

2129
01:51:52,690 --> 01:51:56,440
he was exonerated and Krakauer wants
has got to be expelled even though the

2130
01:51:56,441 --> 01:52:00,430
court system found him innocent
and he's created this like um,

2131
01:52:00,730 --> 01:52:04,180
anonymous identity for this chick, her
name, he calls her Washburn, like her,

2132
01:52:04,181 --> 01:52:08,380
I forget her first name in the book,
but like there's this case, you know,

2133
01:52:08,381 --> 01:52:13,060
University of Montana where the guys
found innocent and even after he's found

2134
01:52:13,061 --> 01:52:15,790
innocent, he's still being tortured
with being called a rapist.

2135
01:52:15,791 --> 01:52:18,370
He's still being tortured with
calling, you know, being called.

2136
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:23,770
And I think I got to say like
damaging accusations of rape.

2137
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:27,910
Rape is like a serious, terrible crime.
It's like as, as Dershowitz has put it,

2138
01:52:27,911 --> 01:52:29,920
it's the most falsely reported crime,

2139
01:52:30,130 --> 01:52:33,220
but it's also the most under reported
crime that we sort of have in our society.

2140
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:37,360
Blot. On the other hand, like it should
be a big deal to accuse somebody publicly.

2141
01:52:37,361 --> 01:52:40,330
You should, I mean, under
the sixth amendment of the
United States constitution,

2142
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:42,610
you have a right to
confront your accusers.

2143
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:46,790
How can you confront them if the trials
occurring the media without your ability

2144
01:52:46,791 --> 01:52:50,780
to even respond to the non, you
know, anonymous allegations.
So it's kind of like,

2145
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:53,780
it's like a trade off thing and it's
really difficult to make the balance.

2146
01:52:53,781 --> 01:52:56,840
Anyone who says definitively like I
have the answer for you on this stuff,

2147
01:52:57,170 --> 01:52:59,930
she totally full of shit because
it's really hard to know what to do.

2148
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:04,100
You know like should we not write about
the University of Montana case where

2149
01:53:04,101 --> 01:53:07,730
this guy was found not guilty because
he's now been found not guilty even though

2150
01:53:07,731 --> 01:53:09,260
he may have raped her.
Right. We don't know.

2151
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:11,810
Just because the court
system decides something.

2152
01:53:11,811 --> 01:53:13,880
We know there are many cases
where courts get things wrong.

2153
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:15,830
Somebody on Twitter pointed
out something really good,

2154
01:53:16,250 --> 01:53:20,780
but I need to adjust the white people
that rioted in the hockey riots have a

2155
01:53:20,781 --> 01:53:23,990
Vancouver.
I was actually there for that.

2156
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:28,420
I was there right before that went down.
I left just before the riots. It was,

2157
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:32,210
well I didn't see the riots, but I
had been in the town. I was like,

2158
01:53:32,211 --> 01:53:34,580
there's so nice up here.
How the fuck are they riding?

2159
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:36,710
So somebody had a good point.
White people do. Right.

2160
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:40,490
But it's all over sporting events
and it's over relatively quickly.

2161
01:53:40,660 --> 01:53:43,850
We're not only that, the people
that riot, we're so fucking stupid.

2162
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,820
They were doing it while everyone was
taking pictures and posting it on social

2163
01:53:46,821 --> 01:53:49,430
media and a giant chunk
of them went to jail,

2164
01:53:50,060 --> 01:53:51,930
like a giant chunk of
them got arrested for it.

2165
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:54,200
Take for you to actually write
it. I've always, I've always,

2166
01:53:54,201 --> 01:53:57,020
I asked my wife this the other day,
I was like, well what do you like,

2167
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:59,690
why would we riot honey? You know, like,

2168
01:54:00,110 --> 01:54:03,520
I can't imagine a scenario in
which I'm like burning things down,

2169
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:06,500
destroying people's property.
Well, you're not poor, true,

2170
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:10,150
poor and desperate and you don't,
there are lots of poor people. Those,

2171
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:13,550
a downside future like,
right. No, definitely.

2172
01:54:13,551 --> 01:54:15,950
But I think that's a big
part of it. I mean the, the,

2173
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,800
the writing and the hockey riots,
those are fucking retards.

2174
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:21,470
I think it's a young man thing
too though. For sure. Yeah.

2175
01:54:21,471 --> 01:54:25,160
It was all a whole lot of young
women out there rioting a video, uh,

2176
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:29,420
which is making the rounds, um, called
good morning, good morning, Baltimore.

2177
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:32,420
You know, like that old, we did
a video where we took all of the,

2178
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:36,710
the shots of the rioters and put it
to like this music and it's like,

2179
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:41,450
it's really like, it's fucking, it's
perverse, but it kind of funny. Um,

2180
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:44,390
but I think, I dunno man,
like there's something,

2181
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:48,710
I think there's something tribal about
us as people that like, you know, I've,

2182
01:54:48,860 --> 01:54:49,220
I've had,

2183
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:52,820
I've had this experience at tri at like
sporting events or like at political

2184
01:54:52,821 --> 01:54:56,570
events where you feel
something like overcome you.
And I'm like pretty rational,

2185
01:54:56,571 --> 01:55:00,170
you know, nerdy guy, you know, high
Iq and the bell curve kind of thing.

2186
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:04,460
But like there's something if, if I'm
drawn to it and we're all drawn to it,

2187
01:55:04,461 --> 01:55:08,600
like then the people who are really like
dumb and poor and don't have a lot of

2188
01:55:08,601 --> 01:55:12,290
options and yet they all have smartphones.
Like it gets really scary.

2189
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:13,960
I can certainly, damage can be done. Well,

2190
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:18,650
there's without a doubt there's a certain
aspect of human beings that allows us

2191
01:55:18,651 --> 01:55:23,651
to go with the flow of big movements when
there's big things that are happening,

2192
01:55:23,991 --> 01:55:26,870
there's horrific things that happened
in large groups and mass groups.

2193
01:55:26,871 --> 01:55:31,460
It just wouldn't happen when there's one
person is a weird thing and I think the

2194
01:55:31,461 --> 01:55:33,830
sporting events like thing of
the white people that riot.

2195
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:37,490
I think that that is like what I'm
talking about like part of this tribe and

2196
01:55:37,491 --> 01:55:40,480
you're just like boils over cause when
you have a whole lot of like you know

2197
01:55:40,490 --> 01:55:42,020
shit heads together like we
were talking about earlier,

2198
01:55:42,021 --> 01:55:44,070
like 1% of them are going
to be assholes or whatever

2199
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:47,850
and I'm sure it starts really slowly
like one guy break something and then

2200
01:55:47,851 --> 01:55:49,460
everyone else starts breaking shit.
Right.

2201
01:55:49,630 --> 01:55:52,000
Well think that's also speaks
to what we're talking about,

2202
01:55:52,001 --> 01:55:56,950
the incredible difficulty of escaping
from a ghetto because we imitate our

2203
01:55:56,951 --> 01:55:58,960
atmospheres and we
maintain our atmosphere.

2204
01:55:58,961 --> 01:56:02,470
Atmosphere is boiling over into mad
violence and rioting and looting.

2205
01:56:02,890 --> 01:56:06,700
There's a lot of people that just succumb
to that influence and just give in and

2206
01:56:06,701 --> 01:56:11,440
be overcome. I don't think we're nearly
as autonomous as we like to think we are.

2207
01:56:11,470 --> 01:56:16,470
I think we are a giant super organism
and we have our own individual identities

2208
01:56:16,721 --> 01:56:17,980
inside the super organism.

2209
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:22,440
Wilson says that he says we're like
ants like as a species. Um, you know,

2210
01:56:22,441 --> 01:56:25,860
the great biologist,
evolutionary biologist, he says
that we're basically a soup.

2211
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,810
Well, it's not just us, it's
pretty much every organism.

2212
01:56:28,811 --> 01:56:32,560
How do you think those birds fly together
in these giant flocks and go left and

2213
01:56:32,561 --> 01:56:37,090
right and move around like,
like, like they're like,
they're all being controlled.

2214
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:38,740
How does it happen with fish?

2215
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:43,870
How does it go with all sorts of animals
that exist in pastoring? Totally. Yeah.

2216
01:56:43,871 --> 01:56:46,690
We, we have, you know, we, we,

2217
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:52,080
we have groups and these groups act
as a unit and when the group riots,

2218
01:56:52,690 --> 01:56:56,170
I think people become incredibly
compelled to become a part of that.

2219
01:56:56,410 --> 01:57:01,030
And it takes amazing
resolve and intelligence if
you're a trapped in that to

2220
01:57:01,031 --> 01:57:02,290
avoid the influence of that.

2221
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:04,190
Sure. But like, so like take the case,

2222
01:57:04,191 --> 01:57:06,500
like there was a famous sociological
experiment where we took,

2223
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:09,590
we gave blacks in the ghetto.

2224
01:57:09,591 --> 01:57:12,410
We gave them like section eight vouchers
to like get the hell out of the ghetto.

2225
01:57:12,530 --> 01:57:14,020
Right.
And we started,

2226
01:57:14,030 --> 01:57:16,790
it was like an Atlantic article on
this like maybe four or five years ago.

2227
01:57:17,090 --> 01:57:20,240
But what happened was was that we gave
all these section eight vouchers to get

2228
01:57:20,241 --> 01:57:22,010
out of the ghetto.
Right. And what happened?

2229
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:25,880
Like people got out of the ghetto and
then they started committing crimes like

2230
01:57:26,210 --> 01:57:28,400
in their new area. So like
we gave everyone, you know,

2231
01:57:28,401 --> 01:57:31,520
like whatever the rental equivalent is
and then you can move into like a nicer

2232
01:57:31,521 --> 01:57:33,620
area and they brought the crime with them.

2233
01:57:33,770 --> 01:57:37,850
So that just goes to show like how much
it's like a part of you once you grow up

2234
01:57:37,851 --> 01:57:40,880
in it or how much it's a part
of your brain. You know, like,

2235
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:43,250
so this book I'm reading right now,

2236
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:46,400
this is like the best book I've read
in like 10 years. It's called sapiens.

2237
01:57:46,790 --> 01:57:49,400
And it's about basically
what makes humans like,

2238
01:57:49,401 --> 01:57:50,860
what made us different from all the other,
you know,

2239
01:57:50,930 --> 01:57:53,620
homos or I guess animal almost.
You know,

2240
01:57:53,630 --> 01:57:57,080
I'm a erectus homo
neanderthal or whatever.

2241
01:57:57,350 --> 01:58:00,770
And what he says is there's this thing
that we have as humans where we take on

2242
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:01,613
fictions,

2243
01:58:01,730 --> 01:58:06,230
like we believe certain isms and that
becomes like most primate species.

2244
01:58:06,231 --> 01:58:09,350
It's like, you know, a few people are
in your tribe and are in your group.

2245
01:58:09,770 --> 01:58:12,140
You know, like humans. I
think it's like 150 maximum.

2246
01:58:12,141 --> 01:58:15,470
That's like the Max size of
uh, of, uh, of a tribe. Um,

2247
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:18,500
but what happens is that we all start
to like believe certain narratives about

2248
01:58:18,501 --> 01:58:19,550
the world in our brains.

2249
01:58:19,551 --> 01:58:23,240
We're getting kind of like brainwashed
or whatever and then we start to act on

2250
01:58:23,241 --> 01:58:27,770
our commitment to that fiction that
we've created. And it's kind of wild.

2251
01:58:27,771 --> 01:58:30,110
Like when you think about it, like
there's so many fictions in your society,

2252
01:58:30,111 --> 01:58:34,190
so many things you unconsciously
believe so many ism, you know his isms.

2253
01:58:34,191 --> 01:58:38,240
But also like things like joint stock
companies or like legal documents.

2254
01:58:38,241 --> 01:58:40,130
I mean all of law,
if you think of it as just a fiction,

2255
01:58:40,131 --> 01:58:42,520
we all agree on it's
the same kind of thing.

2256
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:45,370
And his book is really kind of like
challenged a lot of my thinking on this

2257
01:58:45,371 --> 01:58:47,380
because like, you know, if you're in the,

2258
01:58:47,650 --> 01:58:51,250
if you're creating this mindset that
like people are so put upon, so put upon,

2259
01:58:51,251 --> 01:58:54,640
so put upon, they'll start to act
like they're so put upon, right?

2260
01:58:54,641 --> 01:58:56,650
Cause it's like there they get infected,

2261
01:58:56,651 --> 01:58:59,950
their brains get infected and it
becomes really hard to persuade people

2262
01:58:59,951 --> 01:59:01,720
particularly it's like
it's pretty self serving.

2263
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:04,450
If you just say like you're in the
ghetto and you're fucked because like,

2264
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:07,780
you know, there are many examples of
people like surviving out of the ghetto,

2265
01:59:07,781 --> 01:59:09,010
people moving out of the ghetto.

2266
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:12,940
There are many like human beings are
much more malleable I think then of like,

2267
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:13,241
you know,

2268
01:59:13,241 --> 01:59:17,770
escaping from terrible circumstances and
yet what we do as a society as we say,

2269
01:59:17,771 --> 01:59:20,880
like, no, you're fucked. Like you're done.
You know, you're never going to end it.

2270
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:23,830
Like we should be like thinking about
waste so we can orient the society.

2271
01:59:23,831 --> 01:59:27,880
So they're more options. But like it's
really hard. People are more malleable.

2272
01:59:27,881 --> 01:59:30,970
But I disagree that people are more
malleable when it comes to the ability to

2273
01:59:30,971 --> 01:59:34,900
escape the ghetto. I think there's
everything is stacked against you.

2274
01:59:34,930 --> 01:59:38,170
If you're in that environment financially
it's tacked against you as far as the

2275
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:41,280
behavior that you're imitating,
your atmosphere around all those,

2276
01:59:41,550 --> 01:59:44,530
the fear affects too,
like your fear of friends and stuff.

2277
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:48,340
It's not like you live in Irvine and you
know your family's of moderate income

2278
01:59:48,341 --> 01:59:52,540
and you figure out a way to make it so
it's nothing that's really weird to me.

2279
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:54,940
Like I did a lot of reporting on the
Ferguson stuff and the thing that was

2280
01:59:54,941 --> 01:59:58,150
really weird to me are like where'd
these affluent black kids who are like

2281
01:59:58,151 --> 02:00:01,780
coming in like slumming in the
ghettos of Ferguson? And like,

2282
02:00:01,810 --> 02:00:03,430
I'd never seen anything like this.
I mean,

2283
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:07,030
so like there were a number of like black
radical activist types of can Chicago

2284
02:00:07,031 --> 02:00:09,520
and the suburbs there who basically like,
you know,

2285
02:00:09,670 --> 02:00:12,970
black guys who his parents are like
doctors, lawyers, whatever. You know,

2286
02:00:12,971 --> 02:00:15,620
like people who like, you
know, not, I mean you know,

2287
02:00:15,790 --> 02:00:18,400
not obviously not every black person
is kind of like living in the ghetto.

2288
02:00:18,401 --> 02:00:20,590
I mean there are lots of dumb, we
live, you know, whatever. Right.

2289
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:25,120
So what was interesting about this is
there all these cases of like to be like

2290
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:28,150
authentically black.
These kids who were like,

2291
02:00:28,151 --> 02:00:30,760
you know when to fancy schools
went to good schools or whatever,

2292
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:35,050
they felt they had to go and participate
in like you know the anti-cop protests

2293
02:00:35,051 --> 02:00:36,040
or the,
you know what I mean?

2294
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:40,450
Like but isn't that also possibly because
they recognize that they were lucky

2295
02:00:40,451 --> 02:00:42,640
and they want to help maybe yeah,
you could be right.

2296
02:00:42,670 --> 02:00:43,960
Like I hadn't thought of it that way.

2297
02:00:43,961 --> 02:00:47,230
I think you may be right but
I I maybe on the other hand,

2298
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:49,870
I mean yeah you probably are right
about that to a certain extent.

2299
02:00:49,871 --> 02:00:52,930
I'm sure there's a motivation of that
but I also think it's kind of weird too

2300
02:00:52,931 --> 02:00:55,150
that your parents give you
all these options, right?

2301
02:00:55,151 --> 02:00:58,780
To escape the ghetto and you returned to
the ghetto as like a, you know, to like,

2302
02:00:58,810 --> 02:01:02,920
cause trouble, like in their
mind they're not causing trouble.

2303
02:01:02,921 --> 02:01:06,090
They're there in their mind they're
trying to enact some sort of change. True.

2304
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:09,190
True. To a certain extent. Yeah. What's
going on Aaron? Greer? Baltimore.

2305
02:01:09,191 --> 02:01:12,640
Not Mom beats the mom who rescued.
Uh,

2306
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:16,540
she saw her son on the TV and went after
him. She beating the shit out of them.

2307
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:19,660
I liked, I liked that. I
mean, I think it's good.

2308
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:22,060
I think if people took more
responsibility for their own,

2309
02:01:22,061 --> 02:01:24,490
for their family members,
you know, like if you saw,

2310
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:28,360
if you saw like your friend on TV, right?
And you'd be like, dude, like don't write.

2311
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:32,920
I don't like the beading thing though.
I'm not cool on.

2312
02:01:32,921 --> 02:01:36,040
That's probably the only way to get this.
He's got a mask on.

2313
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:41,900
Oh yeah. I mean, I don't agree
with the beating either, but fuck,

2314
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:46,220
the whole thing is Iraq.
What do you think's going to
happen in Baltimore? Yeah.

2315
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:48,530
Well ultimately,

2316
02:01:48,531 --> 02:01:52,490
I mean I'm sure they have the national
guard's down there now and there was

2317
02:01:52,491 --> 02:01:53,620
probably going to Bli on,

2318
02:01:53,621 --> 02:01:56,870
so we'll escalate and then like
Ferguson will eventually calmed down.

2319
02:01:56,871 --> 02:01:59,270
But do you know what really pisses
me off though and this whole thing,

2320
02:01:59,350 --> 02:02:02,690
there are all these people who are like
trying to spin it politically. How so?

2321
02:02:02,691 --> 02:02:04,550
Like all of these people were like,
it's true.

2322
02:02:04,551 --> 02:02:07,460
Like there hasn't been a Republican
mayor of Baltimore since like the 60s or

2323
02:02:07,461 --> 02:02:10,700
whatever, but they're like, liberals
did this, liberalism did this.

2324
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:13,730
Like there are lots of places that are
run by liberals that are like perfectly

2325
02:02:13,731 --> 02:02:17,000
fine places to live and go to boulder,
Colorado. Yeah. It's all liberals.

2326
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:20,270
Nobody gives a shit. Everybody's
nicest shit. Or West west side La,

2327
02:02:20,630 --> 02:02:24,230
Seattle or Boston, you know,
like Asheville, North Carolina,

2328
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:29,840
liberal places that are great. Yeah. Yeah.
It's not a liberal or Republican thing.

2329
02:02:29,841 --> 02:02:33,530
It's a poor people thing. It's a lack
of hope thing. It's a crime thing.

2330
02:02:33,531 --> 02:02:36,710
It's a poor people too.
To him of the environment thing.

2331
02:02:36,711 --> 02:02:39,080
We have a whole lot of poor
s Asian people like you know,

2332
02:02:39,081 --> 02:02:41,870
in the San Gabriel valley,
we have a whole lot of poor ass Mexicans.

2333
02:02:41,871 --> 02:02:45,140
We have a poor la boats all sized right
to the heart of what happened in the

2334
02:02:45,141 --> 02:02:47,480
first place. It's so fucking
police brutality is. Sure.

2335
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:51,200
I mean we don't know what
the fuck happened. We don't
have a video in this one,

2336
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:54,680
but we do have a video of that guy
running from the cop and getting shot from

2337
02:02:54,681 --> 02:02:58,940
behind. Sure. You know we have that one
from South Carolina. Yeah, Walter Scott,

2338
02:02:59,170 --> 02:03:02,780
we case. Yeah. You know we
have a series of of that.

2339
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:06,680
We have the 12 year old kid that had the
fucking toy gun where the cops pulled

2340
02:03:06,681 --> 02:03:11,300
the car over and just shot him. Sure. We
have a lot to put yourself in that case.

2341
02:03:11,301 --> 02:03:14,970
Right. And that example of the Tamir Rice
situation, right. Kid with a fake gun,

2342
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:18,030
fake gun. So that area is like
known for having people with,

2343
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:20,490
with those types of guns,
robbing people. Right.

2344
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:22,580
It's known as like a
really shitty part of town.

2345
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:25,850
You're getting reports of somebody who's
like running around in a park with a

2346
02:03:25,851 --> 02:03:26,661
gun,
right?

2347
02:03:26,661 --> 02:03:31,460
The kamikaze known for
being an overbearing over
violent cop who was released

2348
02:03:31,461 --> 02:03:34,790
from another police force and they
didn't want to have to retrain him.

2349
02:03:34,791 --> 02:03:37,910
So desired and another cop, bad
cop, no doubt about it. But,

2350
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:41,210
but in any population of anything,
you're going to get shitty teachers,

2351
02:03:41,211 --> 02:03:43,610
good teachers, bad cops,
good cops. You know,

2352
02:03:43,611 --> 02:03:48,611
the system that you build should be
built towards like trying to assess the

2353
02:03:48,741 --> 02:03:53,150
worst case scenarios. Right? And like
in some of these cases, like, you know,

2354
02:03:53,151 --> 02:03:56,690
Darren Wilson is a good example by the
way. People should go see that Ferguson,

2355
02:03:56,700 --> 02:03:59,300
the play, like it's getting all
this attention. The Guy, yeah,

2356
02:03:59,301 --> 02:04:02,480
there's this Guy Phil Mcaleer, he's like
a friend of mine, he's an Irish guy,

2357
02:04:02,481 --> 02:04:06,320
he's a journalist and he
did verbatim theater of, um,

2358
02:04:06,710 --> 02:04:09,650
of the Ferguson stuff where they just
read the grand jury transcript and it's

2359
02:04:09,651 --> 02:04:13,100
caused like all this controversy
and craziness. It's here in la.

2360
02:04:13,101 --> 02:04:16,250
And it's like totally not even political.
They're just like reading this.

2361
02:04:16,251 --> 02:04:18,380
But it's political because they're
reading the script, you know what I mean?

2362
02:04:18,381 --> 02:04:21,440
It's like one of those kinds of
situations and it's really fascinating.

2363
02:04:21,441 --> 02:04:23,840
Like I'd read the grand jury
transcripts and everything,

2364
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:28,850
but to see like actual actors and human
beings like talk about the, you know,

2365
02:04:28,851 --> 02:04:30,060
what actually happened,
like,

2366
02:04:30,170 --> 02:04:33,560
and then obviously the actors are
making choices and whatnot, like stress,

2367
02:04:33,561 --> 02:04:35,330
certain words cause we
just have a transcript.

2368
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:37,740
But it was like pretty
riveting stuff of crazy.

2369
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,750
But like if you look at like
the Darren Wilson thing,

2370
02:04:39,751 --> 02:04:43,140
it's like a perfect example of this.
Like we don't really know what happened.

2371
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:47,740
Like what, we definitely know that that
kid punched him. The kid's dead. Yeah.

2372
02:04:47,770 --> 02:04:51,300
The kid punched him and the kid was shot
at close range while I was trying to

2373
02:04:51,301 --> 02:04:54,240
get the guy's gun. Yeah, we know.
We know the autopsy all that's true.

2374
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:55,980
But like we don't know what was said.

2375
02:04:56,100 --> 02:04:58,140
We don't know what they had for breakfast
that well. You know what I mean?

2376
02:04:58,141 --> 02:05:01,650
Like we don't know. No. And
the thing is like we as humans,

2377
02:05:01,651 --> 02:05:03,150
like Ben Gazi is another example.
This,

2378
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:07,080
like all these events happen and people
just go on like project their views,

2379
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:09,840
their experiences, their life,
their whatever unto them.

2380
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:14,430
And did they come kind of like roar shock
techs are like inkblots and we should

2381
02:05:14,431 --> 02:05:15,600
be really like hesitant.

2382
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:19,800
Like it's true that co that blacks
are disproportionately killed by cops.

2383
02:05:20,130 --> 02:05:23,850
It's also true that blacks
disproportionately commit
a lot of crime, right?

2384
02:05:24,090 --> 02:05:26,850
Like if you, if you look at
like the Asian stats, right?

2385
02:05:27,180 --> 02:05:29,580
If you compare the Asian to the
black stats in terms of crime,

2386
02:05:29,790 --> 02:05:31,080
it's like night and day, right? Right.

2387
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:35,180
But you're also dealing with people
that again grew up and are a sub.

2388
02:05:35,181 --> 02:05:39,150
There are product of these environments
and disproportionately black,

2389
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:43,440
disproportionately black in,
in these crime ridden,

2390
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,700
horrific environment.

2391
02:05:44,701 --> 02:05:47,670
I mean like if you have all these housing
projects and the hell hole of like not

2392
02:05:47,671 --> 02:05:49,650
having fathers around, I'm
with you on all of this, right?

2393
02:05:49,950 --> 02:05:52,530
But I think we need to be like,
I think these,

2394
02:05:52,590 --> 02:05:56,970
these communities are so intractable
and the solutions that we've offered for

2395
02:05:56,971 --> 02:05:59,850
many, many years of like
they're not solving the problem.

2396
02:05:59,851 --> 02:06:02,960
And I don't know that we can ever really
solve them. And that's kind of like,

2397
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:06,210
to me, that's the most terrifying thing
about this is that it's just a permanent

2398
02:06:06,211 --> 02:06:07,220
feature of modern life.

2399
02:06:07,230 --> 02:06:10,170
Don't think there's enough effort
put to try to solve the problem.

2400
02:06:10,171 --> 02:06:12,900
And I think the,
the clear root of that problem is,

2401
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:16,920
I described it yesterday in terms
of if we are a super organism,

2402
02:06:16,970 --> 02:06:19,320
we look at it and look at our,
our,

2403
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:23,190
our country as a microcosm
of the world super organism.

2404
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:25,590
What's the issue with this organism?
Will,

2405
02:06:25,591 --> 02:06:28,680
the issue is the organism has some
six spots. It's not dealing with,

2406
02:06:28,890 --> 02:06:31,860
the way I described it yesterday is if
you have a staph infection and you're

2407
02:06:31,861 --> 02:06:35,280
angry at the staph infection for
not healing, sure. Right? I mean,

2408
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:37,810
it's like a fucking
stupid staph infection.

2409
02:06:37,811 --> 02:06:39,870
Why don't you pull yourself
up by your bootstraps? I like,

2410
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:42,570
but if you look at like say
like a staph infection, right?

2411
02:06:42,570 --> 02:06:45,930
Like if you're a super organism or
whatever, we're all gonna die, right?

2412
02:06:45,931 --> 02:06:47,490
Like at some point like
we're going to get, you know,

2413
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:49,320
we're going to get inoperable
brain cancer, whatever,

2414
02:06:49,321 --> 02:06:51,090
something's going to happen to us.
Like that's part of life.

2415
02:06:51,450 --> 02:06:56,340
Like I think we undersell how much of
life is just playing shitty and like we're

2416
02:06:56,341 --> 02:06:57,870
always like,
as like Americans,

2417
02:06:57,871 --> 02:07:01,170
like we're always trying to like
solve these problems. Right? But like,

2418
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:04,440
like sometimes things are just not
solvable, right? Like sometimes,

2419
02:07:04,441 --> 02:07:08,210
so this is certainly solvable. This
is, you're more optimistic than I am.

2420
02:07:08,211 --> 02:07:10,190
We're optimistic.
But you're talking about like we've,

2421
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:12,540
you have a broken arm but he then
we'll fuck it. I'm going to die anyway.

2422
02:07:12,541 --> 02:07:14,920
Why go to the Donald? But I mean that's
essentially what you're saying. No, no,

2423
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:18,480
not exactly though. I'm
saying like there's certain
things, let's take a cancer,

2424
02:07:19,290 --> 02:07:21,690
right? Inoperable cancer. Right.
And we're a staff weren't, you know,

2425
02:07:21,930 --> 02:07:26,310
there are citizen and nonporous but there
are certain ghettos aren't inoperable.

2426
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:28,800
I mean how would you, how
would, how would we solve that?

2427
02:07:28,801 --> 02:07:32,010
We would go home my money and go,
fuck, it should make an effort.

2428
02:07:32,310 --> 02:07:35,100
How about some effort?
There's almost being done.

2429
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:37,590
If you look at like Dorchester
while I used to live, right. Um,

2430
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:40,060
and how shitty and rundown it was.
You know,

2431
02:07:40,061 --> 02:07:41,500
they're putting in all these new schools,

2432
02:07:41,501 --> 02:07:44,740
they're putting in school choice things.
It's charter school is all that. I'm all,

2433
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:47,230
some people get upset at
that. I'm all right. Yeah.

2434
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:49,680
And then they get pissed off because
they're real estate prices go up. Right.

2435
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:51,360
So it's like, and then, yeah,

2436
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:54,010
poor people have always gotten
fucked throughout human history.

2437
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:59,080
Like it's just a shitty part of existence.
You know, like, and I don't know,

2438
02:07:59,260 --> 02:08:00,610
so many of the solutions we offered,

2439
02:08:00,611 --> 02:08:03,130
we built housing projects to help
people with affordable housing. Right.

2440
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:07,810
Then they became like dens of crime,
you know, like affordable housing.

2441
02:08:07,811 --> 02:08:11,320
It just makes it cheaper for people
to live in a fucked up place.

2442
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:13,540
It doesn't change the fucked up place.

2443
02:08:13,541 --> 02:08:16,900
You have to figure out a way somehow or
another, and I'm not a social engineer,

2444
02:08:17,320 --> 02:08:21,400
but I think there has to be some sort
of a way to look at these communities.

2445
02:08:21,401 --> 02:08:23,740
And there's six spots.
These are,

2446
02:08:23,741 --> 02:08:27,610
these are areas where there's a
disease and that disease is crime.

2447
02:08:27,611 --> 02:08:31,120
And poverty and you have to figure
out a way to make it better.

2448
02:08:31,150 --> 02:08:34,440
And one of the ways to make it better,
as you got to shine a light on it,

2449
02:08:34,470 --> 02:08:36,830
you've got to pay attention to it and
you got to put a lot of money into it.

2450
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:37,150
You gotta,

2451
02:08:37,150 --> 02:08:41,410
you gotta put a lot of money into it
in terms of trying to build up that

2452
02:08:41,411 --> 02:08:43,240
community,
trying to help those people.

2453
02:08:43,270 --> 02:08:45,940
But if you look at like the La public
schools or you look at some of the public

2454
02:08:45,941 --> 02:08:50,570
school systems up there, we pour shitloads
of money into them. Yeah. Awful there.

2455
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:53,470
We get nothing for the money. See,
to me, what's scary about this,

2456
02:08:53,710 --> 02:08:55,770
like I talked to my family in Baltimore,
like if,

2457
02:08:55,780 --> 02:08:59,350
you know what's scary to me about this
is that like what happens is that they

2458
02:08:59,351 --> 02:09:02,080
get political leadership and it's
not a Democrat Republican thing.

2459
02:09:02,081 --> 02:09:05,620
People are trying to put it in that Lens.
It's they get political leadership.

2460
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:07,330
I mean the mayor before this last one,

2461
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:11,980
like when to jail was indicted for
corruption. They get these really corrupt,

2462
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:15,700
thuggish bad people. And I'm not saying
that thuggish cause they're black,

2463
02:09:15,701 --> 02:09:18,550
you know I'm saying they're thugs
because they're thugs, right? They,

2464
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:22,000
they prey on their own people and they
pray in their own communities and it's

2465
02:09:22,001 --> 02:09:25,480
really like sick. And I don't know how
you solve that. If we're going to have,

2466
02:09:25,481 --> 02:09:29,050
like, if we're going to have a society
where people can vote and elect people,

2467
02:09:29,051 --> 02:09:31,540
like, I mean, so much of the
political system is bullshit.

2468
02:09:31,570 --> 02:09:33,790
Even in like the wealthier
parts of the country, right?

2469
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:36,730
We still have to deal with assholes who
like pretend to represent us who are

2470
02:09:36,731 --> 02:09:40,540
whatever party. And yet like these people
have no choice. They're often like,

2471
02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:42,940
you know, the people who
get elected or like corrupt,

2472
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,670
they're bad people and yet
like they're supposed to,

2473
02:09:45,671 --> 02:09:50,580
I mean you can't get a good system out
of a corrupt yeah. Group of people.

2474
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:54,310
You're just not going to happen. Right. I
see what you're saying. And I think the,

2475
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:59,010
uh, you're ultimately correct and I think
that, I mean, what do you do? Do you do,

2476
02:09:59,011 --> 02:10:01,460
do you send in like the National Guard?
I'm like martial law.

2477
02:10:01,490 --> 02:10:05,590
No cause it's a millet. There's gotta
be some way to enhance the communities.

2478
02:10:05,591 --> 02:10:08,220
There's gotta be some way to enhance
the education is going to be some,

2479
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:11,530
there's gotta be some way. I'm not
the guy you, no, no, no, no. My time,

2480
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:15,430
and I think this is something that
needs to be looked at objectively over

2481
02:10:15,431 --> 02:10:18,400
longterm. It's, it's gotta
be a project where you,

2482
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:23,790
he's somehow or another half to revitalize
and reenergize these areas and then

2483
02:10:24,341 --> 02:10:29,140
deal with the fact that the momentum of
the past is so goddamn strong in these

2484
02:10:29,141 --> 02:10:32,680
places and they've been fucked for
decade after decade after decade,

2485
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:33,980
generation after

2486
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:37,790
generation, after generation of people
born to this thing with very little

2487
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:40,560
recourse. I think Obama's right. I mean,

2488
02:10:40,561 --> 02:10:41,940
I don't agree with Obama
and all that stuff,

2489
02:10:41,941 --> 02:10:43,710
but I think Obama's right
when he says that, you know,

2490
02:10:43,711 --> 02:10:47,010
he quotes Faulkner saying that the
past isn't pass. It's not, you know,

2491
02:10:47,011 --> 02:10:51,510
at the past is not finished. It's not
even past. Yeah, you're right. Like,

2492
02:10:51,511 --> 02:10:54,540
I mean there is something to be said
for this being a legacy of slavery.

2493
02:10:54,541 --> 02:10:58,200
It's a legacy of like failed
urban policies of the 60s.
It's a legacy of like,

2494
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:00,870
we're always like kind
of dependent on history.

2495
02:11:00,871 --> 02:11:03,480
Like history is still very much alive.
And some of these places, you know,

2496
02:11:03,990 --> 02:11:08,850
well it's so recent as we're
talking about slavery being 1865,

2497
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:13,230
that's just not that long ago and
50 years. It's nothing. It's a blip.

2498
02:11:13,680 --> 02:11:16,410
Um,
the University of Virginia Case,

2499
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:22,040
is there any repercussion against
the girl who filed the fee? She's,

2500
02:11:22,041 --> 02:11:24,420
she kind of dropped out of school.
I think she works at last I checked,

2501
02:11:24,421 --> 02:11:28,080
she works at a hair salon and it's
just sad. The whole thing is sad.

2502
02:11:28,081 --> 02:11:30,900
Like it's a lot of people think
I take like joy and having,

2503
02:11:30,930 --> 02:11:34,950
I take joy and like exposing the truth
always. But I don't take joy in like,

2504
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:38,400
you know, these people whose property was
destroyed. This girl's life is ruined.

2505
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:41,400
I mean, to a certain extent,
there's, that's like the
social costs. Like I had to,

2506
02:11:41,430 --> 02:11:45,810
I had a responsibility to like make it
public who this person was. Um, I think,

2507
02:11:45,990 --> 02:11:48,090
but um,
it's sad.

2508
02:11:48,091 --> 02:11:51,210
Like the whole situation is kind of sad
and I know there's some people right now

2509
02:11:51,211 --> 02:11:54,150
who want to do like a more comprehensive
report and I'm probably going to help

2510
02:11:54,151 --> 02:11:57,420
with that going into more stuff on
Sabrina Reuben Eardley but they're,

2511
02:11:57,450 --> 02:11:59,580
I mean their fraternities,
their football teams,

2512
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:02,160
there's all this stuff that's under attack
all throughout the country right now

2513
02:12:02,161 --> 02:12:07,140
by the social justice warriors. And um,
it, it's going to be quite frightening.

2514
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:11,150
I think it's going to be, I think it's
going to intensify before it gets, and it,

2515
02:12:11,151 --> 02:12:13,250
what we have right now
is we have a war and I,

2516
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,620
and I hate the word war because like,

2517
02:12:15,630 --> 02:12:17,730
and I hate even the warriors
thing of the social justice thing.

2518
02:12:18,090 --> 02:12:20,730
I prefer like social justice activists
because they're active there.

2519
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:23,310
It's not a war. Like we're not shooting
each other like thank God. Right.

2520
02:12:23,700 --> 02:12:28,700
But I think there really is
like a political electronic
civil war going on right

2521
02:12:29,731 --> 02:12:33,780
now between people who have narrative
based views of the universe and people who

2522
02:12:33,781 --> 02:12:37,200
are fact based and and and their big,
excuse me,

2523
02:12:37,201 --> 02:12:42,201
they're basically at loggerheads and
I don't know how long this can endure.

2524
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:46,890
You know like you talked
about like slavery and the
civil war. Like Lincoln said,

2525
02:12:47,010 --> 02:12:49,020
a house divided against
itself can't stand,

2526
02:12:49,260 --> 02:12:52,590
I don't know how we have journalists
on the one hand who present facts and

2527
02:12:52,591 --> 02:12:55,110
figures and trying to like understand
the world and then others who try and

2528
02:12:55,111 --> 02:12:59,310
basically preach and sell like
crazy narrative the world.

2529
02:12:59,311 --> 02:13:01,500
I don't know how this coexists,
wow.

2530
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:04,040
I think it coexists in that they're there.

2531
02:13:04,050 --> 02:13:09,050
This conflict and the debate and the
discussion people like you or people,

2532
02:13:09,131 --> 02:13:12,670
like many of the people that are
listening to this now or watching this or

2533
02:13:12,671 --> 02:13:16,960
people that are discussing this right
now on Twitter and arguing pro and con

2534
02:13:17,380 --> 02:13:21,970
[inaudible], these subjects get vetted
out. They get discussed, they get debated,

2535
02:13:21,971 --> 02:13:24,790
they get bound, you know,
bounced back and forth.

2536
02:13:24,791 --> 02:13:27,040
And some people will change their minds.

2537
02:13:27,041 --> 02:13:31,860
And some people were will be reinforced
by this conversation and some people be

2538
02:13:31,861 --> 02:13:32,280
angered

2539
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:34,830
by this conversation. Some people
will anger that I have you on. Yeah.

2540
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:38,190
And I saw that it's kind of, what do you
think is up with that? The, the rape, um,

2541
02:13:38,220 --> 02:13:42,030
the outing people.
I think people need to saying their names.

2542
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:43,470
I think that's a big,
that's part of it.

2543
02:13:43,471 --> 02:13:45,900
But I think I also think I've
said some stuff, you know,

2544
02:13:45,901 --> 02:13:48,600
I've said sums up where I've changed my
mind on it and I'm also said stuff on

2545
02:13:48,601 --> 02:13:52,080
Twitter. So I see Twitter as a
way of sparking conversations.

2546
02:13:52,110 --> 02:13:55,200
Like a lot of the stuff that I put on
Twitter I don't necessarily always agree

2547
02:13:55,201 --> 02:13:57,600
with and I'm not trying to be a
troll like necessarily, right.

2548
02:13:57,720 --> 02:14:01,770
I'm trying to like force conversations
that I want to have that no one else has

2549
02:14:01,771 --> 02:14:02,280
having,

2550
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:06,660
well you was the one you have like name
the names of celebrities that are a

2551
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:10,050
support the Baltimore
riots. Yeah. Yeah. No.

2552
02:14:10,051 --> 02:14:13,350
What I want to do with that is I want
people to understand like, you know,

2553
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:16,740
there are people out there
who there should be a
consequence for like supporting

2554
02:14:16,741 --> 02:14:19,560
it. Well, I'm not saying anybody
support any fucking riot.

2555
02:14:19,620 --> 02:14:21,410
There are people out
there like Sally Code.

2556
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:23,990
I mean there are people out there who
are saying them Saturday cone, I'm sure.

2557
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:27,600
I think she's on a MSNBC or she's on CNN
or something. She says riots or, yeah.

2558
02:14:27,601 --> 02:14:29,640
Oh yeah. There are people who
are saying that the riots,

2559
02:14:29,820 --> 02:14:33,510
the response to the riots are a
political thing. It's an uprising.

2560
02:14:33,511 --> 02:14:34,380
It's an insurrection.

2561
02:14:34,530 --> 02:14:38,520
Same people who defended the Ferguson
stuff is a uprising against the police.

2562
02:14:38,521 --> 02:14:42,290
Against the system. Right. Don't
you think though, in some ways the,

2563
02:14:42,291 --> 02:14:46,440
the what the benefit of it is, is that
we're all forced to discuss this now.

2564
02:14:46,590 --> 02:14:49,680
We're all forced to look at the Sherry
of Baltimore, this horrible area.

2565
02:14:50,490 --> 02:14:53,270
And my friend John Rollo lives in
Baltimore and he said, fucking,

2566
02:14:53,310 --> 02:14:56,280
he says there's parts of Baltimore
that are just God damn crazy.

2567
02:14:57,060 --> 02:14:58,050
And we're seeing it right now.

2568
02:14:58,051 --> 02:15:01,470
I mean a lot of people were exposed to
it from the wire and they weren't aware

2569
02:15:01,471 --> 02:15:03,750
of the problem of the wires I tweeted
the other day is that there are far too

2570
02:15:03,751 --> 02:15:07,380
many white people on it. I mean that's
what, that's what this is showing to us.

2571
02:15:08,010 --> 02:15:10,890
I mean, yeah there's, there's some truth
to that. But you know, and like if you're,

2572
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:13,620
my cousin likes to say if your,
if your show,

2573
02:15:13,621 --> 02:15:17,070
if your city is known for the wire
and homicide and all this other stuff,

2574
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:21,300
it's probably not good. Well
it's definitely a fucked
up part of the country.

2575
02:15:21,350 --> 02:15:25,500
It's, and there's many areas that
are like it. Detroit is pretty,

2576
02:15:25,501 --> 02:15:28,790
God damn fucked up.
Tons of Philly Chicago out there.

2577
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:33,360
There's some places that could blow
and there's some places now because of

2578
02:15:33,630 --> 02:15:38,630
youtube and all of these videos that
everyone has a rather a phones that can

2579
02:15:39,901 --> 02:15:40,734
take videos,

2580
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:45,120
you can expose all sorts of shit
that shouldn't be happening.

2581
02:15:45,150 --> 02:15:48,480
But police brutality and then there's
a reaction to it. Do you know, like,

2582
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:50,390
so I've been thinking about this, I
totally agree with you, but nature,

2583
02:15:50,480 --> 02:15:53,100
the nature of like everyone has
these, right, and how awesome that is,

2584
02:15:53,101 --> 02:15:54,510
how powerful it is.
Andrew Breitbart,

2585
02:15:54,511 --> 02:15:57,780
others have talked about how awesome this
technology is. But to a certain extent,

2586
02:15:57,781 --> 02:16:00,390
when I turn on the camera, right, you're
turning on the camera on me. You know,

2587
02:16:00,391 --> 02:16:04,620
we've got this audio equipment
people change, right? So
like to a certain extent,

2588
02:16:04,621 --> 02:16:06,360
when I'm,
when you're running around filming stuff,

2589
02:16:06,361 --> 02:16:08,800
some people are performing for
the camera, no doubt. Right?

2590
02:16:08,950 --> 02:16:10,430
That's escalates because of that.

2591
02:16:10,850 --> 02:16:12,480
And I don't know what you do
about that cause you can't,

2592
02:16:12,810 --> 02:16:14,970
you can't on the one hand sensor
it because if you censor it,

2593
02:16:14,971 --> 02:16:17,250
like that's evil and wicked.
Like we're against that.

2594
02:16:17,310 --> 02:16:20,250
We have a first amendment for a reason
we want to show. But on the other hand,

2595
02:16:20,251 --> 02:16:25,110
like, you know, it's like the, the, what
is it that, um, uh, Paredo a factor.

2596
02:16:25,111 --> 02:16:28,440
There's an effect where basically you
watching something causes people to change

2597
02:16:28,441 --> 02:16:30,160
their behavior.
If you watch your employees

2598
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:33,660
are gonna change their behavior, well,
it just is. I don't think there's,

2599
02:16:33,870 --> 02:16:37,750
I mean it just is, it is a fact. No
solving it. Yeah. It doesn't seem,

2600
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:39,700
it seems to be a new reality.

2601
02:16:39,940 --> 02:16:43,330
Just like how do you get away from the
fact that everyone has a cell phone, you,

2602
02:16:43,380 --> 02:16:44,213
you don't,

2603
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:48,490
unless an asteroid hits and we have a
massive cataclysmic disaster that shuts

2604
02:16:48,491 --> 02:16:52,180
down the power grid and there's no more,
no more monitoring or whatever,

2605
02:16:52,300 --> 02:16:55,120
unless that had walking dead style because
there's not really much you're going

2606
02:16:55,121 --> 02:16:57,520
to be able to do this, this,
this is our new reality.

2607
02:16:57,521 --> 02:17:01,330
Just like the people that live before
cars could never have imagined being able

2608
02:17:01,331 --> 02:17:04,900
to drive across the country in four days,
just like the people existed before.

2609
02:17:04,901 --> 02:17:07,990
Planes can never imagine
it doing it in six hours.

2610
02:17:08,530 --> 02:17:13,530
You're just not going to change that
unless you change the entire civilization.

2611
02:17:14,250 --> 02:17:17,530
This is going to have to happen for
that. Something new. Yeah, totally agree.

2612
02:17:17,650 --> 02:17:21,490
So I don't think we should necessarily
concentrate on that as much as we should

2613
02:17:21,491 --> 02:17:24,670
concentrate on what are the lessons that
we can learn from all this and what I

2614
02:17:24,671 --> 02:17:29,500
think ultimately we have to concentrate
on these areas, whether they're Ferguson,

2615
02:17:29,501 --> 02:17:32,890
which is a very high crime area,
has been for a long time,

2616
02:17:33,340 --> 02:17:37,870
or whether it's Baltimore,
there's, there's areas of
the country that need help.

2617
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:42,100
And the people that grow up in their
grow up in these horrible crime ridden

2618
02:17:42,101 --> 02:17:44,890
environment that really don't have
any other recourse. They don't,

2619
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:47,980
or a lot of recourse I should say. Yeah.
I don't know what to do about it. I mean,

2620
02:17:47,981 --> 02:17:49,210
like one of the things that,

2621
02:17:49,630 --> 02:17:52,270
one of the things that I kind of
feel bad about this, you know,

2622
02:17:52,271 --> 02:17:53,870
like everyone's going after this,
you know,

2623
02:17:53,890 --> 02:17:56,760
this woman Stephanie Rawlings
Blake for saying, you know,

2624
02:17:56,830 --> 02:18:00,130
we need a space to destroy. I went after,
I know a lot of people are going after,

2625
02:18:00,780 --> 02:18:03,160
um, you need a space to
destroy. Did you see this?

2626
02:18:03,161 --> 02:18:06,090
So she did a video where
she said, um, I actually,

2627
02:18:06,820 --> 02:18:09,160
the video that we did have
a good morning Baltimore,

2628
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:12,490
where with the riots we started with this
opening thing where she said, you know,

2629
02:18:12,491 --> 02:18:16,060
we need a safe space
for people to destroy,

2630
02:18:16,061 --> 02:18:19,690
for writers to destroy and people are
going after. She said she misspoke.

2631
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:20,861
I don't know.

2632
02:18:20,861 --> 02:18:23,440
I'd give her the benefit of the doubt
cause she's been kind of like reluctant

2633
02:18:23,441 --> 02:18:25,720
and bringing in the police
to basically solve the riots.

2634
02:18:26,170 --> 02:18:30,760
But basically I feel really bad for her
because like this is a really tough job

2635
02:18:30,761 --> 02:18:33,520
to be mayor. Like, you know, like
I get to be a journalist, you know,

2636
02:18:33,521 --> 02:18:36,460
we get to basically just like bloviate
and bullshit about this, right?

2637
02:18:36,460 --> 02:18:39,190
Like we're not the ones like in these
cities like making these decisions.

2638
02:18:39,490 --> 02:18:42,400
Like I always try and put myself
in the position of people,

2639
02:18:42,700 --> 02:18:43,271
you know what I'm saying?

2640
02:18:43,271 --> 02:18:46,120
Like I was trying to put
myself in their chair and like,

2641
02:18:46,270 --> 02:18:50,050
it's a shitty situation and I don't see
any situation short of like bringing the

2642
02:18:50,051 --> 02:18:54,490
military, which I, you know, I'm not a
big fan of military industrial complex,

2643
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:55,870
but like that's what
they're going to have to do.

2644
02:18:55,880 --> 02:18:59,380
They said did the same thing with the La
riots here, right? Like, um, you know,

2645
02:18:59,381 --> 02:19:02,770
the Koreans were defending themselves
and their rear property. Um,

2646
02:19:02,820 --> 02:19:05,320
and they can't really do that in Maryland
because they don't have concealed

2647
02:19:05,321 --> 02:19:06,220
carry and they have a lot of guns,

2648
02:19:06,310 --> 02:19:09,280
gun restrictions and people who
are in the kind of white areas,

2649
02:19:09,281 --> 02:19:12,070
they are kind of liberals then
wouldn't have guns anyways. Um,

2650
02:19:12,850 --> 02:19:16,900
but what I find really interesting about
this and like is that how quick people

2651
02:19:16,901 --> 02:19:19,450
are to judge our elected leaders
and we should judge them. But like,

2652
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:20,590
it's a hard life.

2653
02:19:20,620 --> 02:19:24,880
Like it's a shitty situation that these
people are in and I guarantee you like

2654
02:19:24,881 --> 02:19:26,830
Stephanie Rawlings Blake,
you know, the mayor there,

2655
02:19:26,920 --> 02:19:27,980
she never thought she'd
have to deal with this

2656
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:30,890
shit. You know, like it's
tough thing. It's a tough gig.

2657
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:34,610
While we try to make sure that we're
protected from the cars and other things

2658
02:19:34,970 --> 02:19:38,030
that were going on.
We also gave those who wished.

2659
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:42,050
What does that the space to destroy?
Yeah.

2660
02:19:42,051 --> 02:19:45,370
There's this face right there,
Huh?

2661
02:19:46,670 --> 02:19:47,503
Wow.

2662
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:51,160
The mayor is not saying that she asks
people to give space to people who sought

2663
02:19:51,170 --> 02:19:54,920
to create violence and he suggestion
otherwise we are misinterpretation of her

2664
02:19:54,921 --> 02:19:57,620
statement or statements sucks,
which is not a good statement.

2665
02:19:57,950 --> 02:20:01,010
What she's saying within the statement
and it ended the video itself like be

2666
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:02,720
people should watch it.
People should make up their own.

2667
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:05,780
I think what happens a lot of these
situations is that the police,

2668
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:10,610
the the activist, there's like a view
among the sort of like, you know,

2669
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:14,180
municipality run system. There's a
view that like, hey, we can't bring,

2670
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:17,230
I can't bring the cops in cars.
If we bring the Compson,

2671
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:19,250
it'll just inflame people because like,
you know,

2672
02:20:19,251 --> 02:20:20,240
it's the same thing with the video camera.

2673
02:20:20,241 --> 02:20:23,180
If you could put a cop and a ghetto
environment, people hate the cops.

2674
02:20:23,210 --> 02:20:25,250
Like they're going to react, right? Like,

2675
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:28,340
and so their view is like we shouldn't
bring the police but then you don't bring

2676
02:20:28,341 --> 02:20:31,160
in the police and then the riots get
even more out of hand and it's like,

2677
02:20:31,580 --> 02:20:33,140
it's like you can't win situation.

2678
02:20:33,170 --> 02:20:36,860
I'm of the opinion that
when we look at these I,

2679
02:20:36,861 --> 02:20:41,530
these isolated instances, any of them
we, we look at it and we say, okay,

2680
02:20:41,580 --> 02:20:43,980
wow this is horrible.
The world is fucked.

2681
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:49,580
But I think that what's going on with
all of these incidences is we're reacting

2682
02:20:49,771 --> 02:20:54,390
to problems that we have in our society.
We have, we're reacting to these,

2683
02:20:54,630 --> 02:20:59,630
these areas that need attention and
these explosive events that cause whether

2684
02:21:01,321 --> 02:21:06,321
it's riots or protests or marches or
all of these things are ultimately good

2685
02:21:06,421 --> 02:21:11,421
because I think they cause people to focus
on these areas that are convenient to

2686
02:21:13,111 --> 02:21:13,740
ignore.

2687
02:21:13,740 --> 02:21:17,130
I told him, I mean I agree with you
that he does spotlight this stuff.

2688
02:21:17,410 --> 02:21:20,160
I had just not, I hope
you're right. Like, I mean,

2689
02:21:20,161 --> 02:21:24,150
like if I go pray that you're correct,
that we can solve a lot of this stuff,

2690
02:21:24,630 --> 02:21:28,650
but like we've been dealing, like not
every society gets a do over, right?

2691
02:21:28,651 --> 02:21:32,220
Like some societies are humble are
fucked from the beginning. Yeah. Right.

2692
02:21:32,221 --> 02:21:35,500
That it's just a question of it playing
out, right? Like, you know, you could,

2693
02:21:35,510 --> 02:21:38,910
we're also the first society that's had
this kind of access to information ever.

2694
02:21:39,130 --> 02:21:42,630
The history that we're, I mean if you're,
if you're, there are two ways to bet,

2695
02:21:42,631 --> 02:21:45,240
right? There's the pessimistic kind
of like, Shit's going to go down,

2696
02:21:45,241 --> 02:21:49,470
all that kind of thing. Which
like, temperamentally, I'm
probably more that way. Um,

2697
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:51,360
but you could be right. I'm not, I'm not,

2698
02:21:51,361 --> 02:21:53,940
I don't dispute you like there's
shit that we'd like, I mean,

2699
02:21:53,941 --> 02:21:57,030
the fact that I have this effect that
I have a career because of this exists,

2700
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:57,720
right?

2701
02:21:57,720 --> 02:22:01,260
And the fact that I'm able to disrupt bad
stuff on the Internet and cause things

2702
02:22:01,261 --> 02:22:05,580
to change, it's all awesome.
All good. Like I'm all for
it. But I think there's a,

2703
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:10,500
the same technology that allows us to
spotlight government abuses can often, uh,

2704
02:22:10,590 --> 02:22:14,850
you know, in the wrong hands can be
used to basically promote and do riots.

2705
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:15,730
I mean like,
well,

2706
02:22:15,730 --> 02:22:19,630
there's not going to be immune.
It's not ultimately the solution.

2707
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:23,260
But I think that if you look
at the course of human history,

2708
02:22:23,261 --> 02:22:26,070
there's no denying that this is
the safest time to live ever. Yeah,

2709
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:26,600
it's awesome.

2710
02:22:26,600 --> 02:22:31,170
And it's also very difficult to deny
that the United States is one of the most

2711
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:34,680
innovative governments,
the most innovative countries ever.

2712
02:22:34,681 --> 02:22:38,160
It's only been around a couple of hundred
years and look at all the crazy shit

2713
02:22:38,161 --> 02:22:41,180
that's happened here. I mean, this is
the, this is awesome. This is so cool.

2714
02:22:41,190 --> 02:22:45,060
The forefront of the world when it
comes to culture. I mean, I feel like I,

2715
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:47,760
I feel like every day with all the
new technology, everything, I mean,

2716
02:22:47,761 --> 02:22:50,680
I grew up with the Internet. Like
I remember waking up one day, fuck,

2717
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:53,820
there was Wikipedia like you,
you know, like I remember like,

2718
02:22:53,821 --> 02:22:55,350
I remember my first Google search.

2719
02:22:55,351 --> 02:22:57,450
Like I grew up like
basically with the Internet.

2720
02:22:57,540 --> 02:23:00,090
My point was that I'm with
you all to more itself.

2721
02:23:00,091 --> 02:23:02,490
It's fucked as it is as fuck
does. It's been, you know,

2722
02:23:02,491 --> 02:23:04,470
it's just these people
that grew up generation,

2723
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:06,900
generation after generation
live and in poverty.

2724
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:10,620
It's only been around a
couple of hundred years total.

2725
02:23:10,660 --> 02:23:14,130
This is a new situation,
but a completely new country.

2726
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:17,640
Ultimately when you look at the,
the, the history of the world. Yeah.

2727
02:23:17,641 --> 02:23:19,410
And you look at like
shit like crack babies,

2728
02:23:19,411 --> 02:23:20,760
which we thought was
going to be huge problem,

2729
02:23:20,761 --> 02:23:23,640
turns out to not have been
a bigger problem. Right?
Like there's a lot of stuff,

2730
02:23:23,641 --> 02:23:27,510
there's a lot of room for optimism and
even things like social justice warriors

2731
02:23:27,511 --> 02:23:32,511
are people that are going after college
campus scenarios where they believe that

2732
02:23:32,641 --> 02:23:36,510
there's men that are committing
rape ultimately what they're doing,

2733
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:41,600
even if I disagree with their methodology
or disagree with their ideology that

2734
02:23:41,971 --> 02:23:44,700
they're pushing forth in
favor of objective truth.

2735
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:48,630
Ultimately it's to try to stop crime,

2736
02:23:48,631 --> 02:23:53,040
stop people from being victimized. It's a
trend. That's a good trend. Yeah, totally.

2737
02:23:53,070 --> 02:23:54,750
I mean, even if it's done in
the wrong way, I mean, look,

2738
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:57,690
but the road to hell is paved with
good intentions. Right. By you,

2739
02:23:57,691 --> 02:24:02,550
you son of a bitch. I'm not honestly, it's
true. It is true. Nobody says like, Yo,

2740
02:24:02,551 --> 02:24:05,130
I'm the villain. Right. Like nobody
ever says there are a few guys,

2741
02:24:05,131 --> 02:24:07,310
but they're pro wrestlers. Yeah,
yeah. And, but they didn't.

2742
