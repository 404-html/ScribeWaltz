1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,320
That's the good version of it.

3
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:04,651
Or whatever.

4
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:06,330
In Dubai in Dubai,

5
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:09,190
it's interesting because they stopped
paying and the fucking workers just start

6
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:10,024
walking home.

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,470
It just all pack their shit and
started walking to the edge of town.

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,570
That whole place is so crazy
that they were ever been there.

9
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:16,404
So yeah,

10
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,330
there were appalling at such a high
level and then it just kind of all came

11
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:22,164
crashing down.

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,630
It's a resource based economy and limited
resource based economy and you can't

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,110
eventually that's going to go dry no
matter if it's now or 50 years from now,

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,270
you're banking your whole worth on oil.

15
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:34,600
These fuckers are going to be hocking
rugs like they were in the fifties sooner

16
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:35,291
than they know it.

17
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,370
And it's going to be a creepy

18
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,210
period for them.

19
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:37,331
Well,

20
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:38,730
they also have debtor's prisons,

21
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:39,550
so you can't be,

22
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,383
you can't be in debt.

23
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,770
You can't just go bankrupt over there.

24
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,060
They just lock you up in jail.

25
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:43,961
So a lot of people,

26
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,550
they parked their Mercedes at the airport,

27
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:47,020
got on a flight and just left everything.

28
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:47,860
But hopefully like,

29
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:48,694
I don't want to be in jail.

30
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,810
Fuck you and your country.

31
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:51,850
Take care of exactly what
people were living there.

32
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,380
Like Michael Jackson was living there.

33
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:53,770
Right.

34
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:53,981
I mean,

35
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:55,030
it got to be this,

36
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:55,390
you know,

37
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,440
really the idea of this enchanted
paradise place where millionaires and just

38
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:00,140
sounds like nuts.

39
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,280
And it sounds like the Las
Vegas run by southern Baptists.

40
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:03,820
Yeah.

41
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,261
The whole thing.

42
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:04,861
It's really fast.

43
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:05,800
And religious police,

44
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:08,470
like I got them called
on me during my show.

45
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:08,860
Ooh.

46
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,450
During your show in Dubai.

47
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,313
Yeah.

48
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,831
Oh,

49
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:12,190
I was,

50
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,460
I was doing a show with Jon
Lovitz of all people I guess.

51
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,420
And um,

52
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,373
he,

53
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:17,830
I was,

54
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,880
I did the first 45,

55
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:21,640
he did a second 45 and I
introduced him in between show.

56
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:21,821
Now,

57
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:22,030
you know,

58
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,130
our shows and I come out and this,

59
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,590
uh,

60
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,700
and um,

61
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,000
so I'm up on stage and um,

62
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,030
I had gone up to the
top of the Burj Khalifa,

63
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:28,631
the tower,

64
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:29,980
the tallest building in the world.

65
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:33,790
I have now been in four of the
tallest structures in the school,

66
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,181
whatever,

67
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:34,361
blah,

68
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:34,481
blah,

69
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:35,290
blah.

70
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:35,950
It's pretty,

71
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,783
it's actually,

72
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,010
you know what it looks like it's the
same deal you get in a landing airplane.

73
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:42,760
You know when you're flying into lax and
you're over the what would be Pasadena

74
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:44,200
and all that Shit and
you're that high in the air.

75
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,010
That's what it looks like.

76
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,160
I would just start shitting
and pissing him pass out.

77
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,970
But it's all dirt.

78
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,720
It's terrible.

79
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,980
And I even said like,

80
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:54,580
I think it's great you guys built a
tower that high because that's dirt looks

81
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,560
its best from about 3000 feet.

82
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,423
You know what I mean?

83
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,720
Dirt up close sucks,

84
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:01,330
but all this dirt so great
to see it cause there's no,

85
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,860
they implant any fucking trees.

86
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:03,700
It's all construction.

87
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:04,534
It looks like shit.

88
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,583
So,

89
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,380
and they don't even like the biggest
observation deck doesn't even face the

90
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:08,771
water,

91
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:11,380
the Caspian Sea cause they wanted to
impress people with what the city looks

92
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:11,561
like.

93
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:13,300
So they put the observation
deck on the inside.

94
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:14,500
Well the city hasn't been built yet,

95
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,610
so bullshit.

96
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:15,861
Anyway,

97
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:16,694
so I go up to the top of it.

98
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,870
It was originally called the
Burj Dubai based on the city,

99
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,240
the Sheikh Khalifa.

100
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:22,720
The,

101
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,500
the president of the UAE gave them
$10 billion to finish the tower,

102
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:30,390
$10 billion to finish it because it
didn't look like it was going to.

103
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,620
And so the on opening day they decided,

104
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:32,951
you know what?

105
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:35,620
Fuck this we're gonna name
it Burj Khalifa after him,

106
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,300
like this impulse thing.

107
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,720
But you go up in it and I was one of
the first 200 people to go up in it,

108
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,290
you know,

109
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,190
and um,

110
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,290
and I go up in the gift shop,

111
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,590
all has shit that says Burj Dubai on
it and it's the same bullshit gift shop

112
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,041
crap.

113
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,320
You'd find that the Sears
tower or in Disneyland,

114
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,000
it's fucking golf shirts and,

115
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,850
and pocket knives and bottle it

116
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,241
winners.

117
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,200
And they all have burdens.

118
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:58,620
You buy paper weights where there's water
in it and you can shake it all comes

119
00:02:58,621 --> 00:02:59,510
on that little tower.

120
00:02:59,590 --> 00:02:59,820
No.

121
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,140
Sudden

122
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,760
sandstorm,

123
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,420
maybe we right when to get one of them.

124
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,970
It's stupid like,

125
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,260
and,

126
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,880
but it all still said Burj Dubai on it.

127
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:07,210
I'm like,

128
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,230
this motherfucker gives you $10 billion
and you can't replace the bullshit

129
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,880
printed tee shirts in 24 hours.

130
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,870
What you say this?

131
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,560
Yes.

132
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,251
So I basically,

133
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:19,060
what I said on stage was it's
pretty rude to miss your Khalifa.

134
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,240
I think that you,

135
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:20,650
you know,

136
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,860
that you did this or whatever because
I'm not paying for my hotel room.

137
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:24,910
But when I call room service,

138
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:25,270
they say,

139
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,811
they say yes,

140
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:26,411
Mr. Sparks.

141
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:28,180
They don't say the guy who
was in the room before me,

142
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,080
you know,

143
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,900
and I was actually trying to
say something deferential,

144
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:32,950
respectful to the guy.

145
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:33,210
Right.

146
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,043
You know.

147
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,290
Well it was the fact that I said Miss
Sheer Khalifa instead of shake Khalifa

148
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,270
that drove this one guy crazy and he stood
up in the back like eight tables back

149
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,170
and people were laughing.

150
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,580
So I didn't see this happen.

151
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,020
He was back in the dark

152
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,200
and he storms out of the fucking place.

153
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,950
Woe is,

154
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,130
I walk offstage to finish my set.

155
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,050
It was great set actually.

156
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:54,040
It had a great time and there was,

157
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,140
he's like $40,000 tables,

158
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,531
you know,

159
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:59,530
Evers round tables in the front full
of shakes and these guys and if I can,

160
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,170
and women in their hijabs and
Burkas and the whole deal.

161
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,240
And then there are business
partners with west,

162
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:04,471
so all,

163
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:04,601
you know,

164
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,434
it's really weird.

165
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,090
It's like offstage and
the promoters there.

166
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:07,924
And he goes,

167
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,710
uh,

168
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,280
yeah.

169
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,113
Uh,

170
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,820
you said something that offended
one of the shakes who was here.

171
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:14,980
And so he called the CID,

172
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:15,731
the religious police,

173
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:18,280
and they're here and they're
going to take you into custody.

174
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,330
We'll try to,

175
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,720
yeah,

176
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,301
this is fucked.

177
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:20,800
That wow.

178
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,500
We'll try and mitigate
it as much as we can.

179
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,850
But the fine could be as much as
$25,000 and three days in jail.

180
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,091
And,

181
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,500
but we'll try and talk them down.

182
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:31,900
And it might not be a big deal because
we're not even sure what he was upset

183
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:32,471
about yet.

184
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:33,720
And we'll try to talk to them about,

185
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,810
but can you go out,

186
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,590
take this out,

187
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,270
can you go out and introduce John?

188
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,110
Fuck,

189
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,310
and then come back and we'll deal with it.

190
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,280
So I walk out on stage and I,

191
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,500
uh,

192
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
I go up on date and I introduced John.

193
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,900
And as I'm on there,

194
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:48,340
as I'm on stage introducing them,

195
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,170
I see them come down the aisle.

196
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,370
I see the religious police,

197
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:52,150
these,

198
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,481
these,

199
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:52,860
uh,

200
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,160
four,

201
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,730
there are three of them in these white
shirts with the little belts that across

202
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,301
their chest.

203
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:01,960
And then we'll stick holsters and stuff
and they're walking down the aisle

204
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:05,620
towards backstage and they go backstage.

205
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,040
And I introduced John and
instead of going backstage,

206
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,880
I walked straight off the stage and walk
right out to the lobby where they had a

207
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,990
table set up for me to sell
shit and sign things right.

208
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,110
Whereas where I had intended
to go in the first place,

209
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,431
but I walked,

210
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:18,821
I just,

211
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:19,710
instead of going backstage,

212
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,860
I went straight out front.

213
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,161
I'm like,

214
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:21,871
they'll find me out there,

215
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:22,421
they're going to find me,

216
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,021
they going to find me,

217
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,810
but I'm going to go out there and do
that shit first and let them stew.

218
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,890
You gotta sell your merchant.

219
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:27,250
Yeah.

220
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,083
Right.

221
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,290
So I go outside and I'm taking a bunch
of pictures and shit up there totally.

222
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,880
And Dvds and,

223
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,900
and took pictures and blah,

224
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:35,410
blah.

225
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,770
And I had a bunch of people
come out because John is Jewish,

226
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,580
I'm not Jewish.

227
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,470
And they definitely have
issues with Jews there.

228
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,490
So a lot of them came,

229
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:45,090
saw me and didn't stick around village,

230
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,761
the Jew,

231
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:46,594
right.

232
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,440
Assholes.

233
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:47,771
Anyway,

234
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:52,180
so they come out and these guys are
back there for 10 fucking minutes before

235
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:53,950
they realize he's not coming back.

236
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,730
Right.

237
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,100
And so they turn around and come out
to the office and right when they walk,

238
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,230
I'm getting a picture with a
shake and his wife like this,

239
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:00,710
like,

240
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,500
like you were in fucking Wisconsin
farm around both of them.

241
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,540
Big stupid grin there smiling.

242
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,150
He's got his fucking classic sunglasses,

243
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,290
White Shawl.

244
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,610
The whole deal is white burqa.

245
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,840
You can't even see her fucking,

246
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,033
this is it.

247
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,990
And I'm just a big smiling picture.

248
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,360
I'm assuming she's smiling and um,

249
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:17,941
and they,

250
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:18,830
they come out and they go,

251
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:19,971
well,

252
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:21,560
if he had said anything offensive,

253
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:22,394
these people would be,

254
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,450
they would not take a picture with him.

255
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,200
This shaker right here.

256
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,450
And his wife would not be taking
pictures if he said anything we're saying

257
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:27,260
they'd saw it.

258
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:27,890
There was,

259
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,910
so they basically said,

260
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,230
wow,

261
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,840
he's not,

262
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,790
he didn't offend anybody
because if he did,

263
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,870
they would be mad too.

264
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,430
And so they went to the,

265
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:34,821
the shake.

266
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,990
Who was standing by the doorway.

267
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,830
I didn't know who it was,

268
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,080
but apparently he was standing it and
then they walked over with their arms

269
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:39,291
crossed.

270
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:39,831
What did he say?

271
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:40,820
What was the big and he goes,

272
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,900
well it wasn't what he said.

273
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,780
I was just thought that other
people might get offended.

274
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,620
He started backtracking on what he said.

275
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,120
Oh.

276
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,950
So they stuck around and watched John
Show for about 10 minutes to make sure he

277
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:53,050
wasn't doing anything untoward.

278
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,890
And I think they ended up
finding him $25,000 fine.

279
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,420
John 25,000 mentioning
his Judaism too much.

280
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,293
Why?

281
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,770
Yeah,

282
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,603
fuck that.

283
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,140
Don't ever go there.

284
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,840
Yeah Dude Dude.

285
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,430
So cause it wasn't anything else.

286
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:08,390
I mean he does this thing.

287
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:09,410
Bob Saget is gay.

288
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:10,280
This song he does,

289
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,560
which might've been it.

290
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:15,320
Cause you mentioned homosexuality is
worse than mentioning Judaism there.

291
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:17,870
I think almost they conflate the two.

292
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:18,760
But it's psychopath.

293
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,360
I mean it's crazy behavior.

294
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,100
Imagine if Fred Phelps,

295
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:23,540
his family ran Vegas.

296
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,800
Who's Fred Phelps?

297
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,480
The Westboro baptist.

298
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:26,870
Yeah.

299
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,950
God hates fags at Oregon.

300
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,843
I was like,

301
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,010
imagine if they ran Vegas.

302
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,820
Oh my God.

303
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,720
And every time you were,

304
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,010
you were having a great time in Vegas.

305
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,130
You had to like Kinda stop and make sure
that nobody went and told Fred Phelps

306
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:37,461
his fans.

307
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:40,300
You have reservations go in there and
performing there and do we like that?

308
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,060
It'll be okay.

309
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,950
I not really,

310
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:46,100
I felt okay about what I was going to
say and I knew that like that was an

311
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:46,401
issue,

312
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:49,550
but I didn't think I was going through
my act going is there anything that

313
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,840
they're gonna come punch.

314
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,441
Did you swear?

315
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:52,220
Do you swear at all?

316
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,850
Yeah.

317
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,140
Yeah,

318
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,930
the story problem.

319
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,230
No,

320
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,620
they didn't.

321
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,240
They weren't bothered by the sexual stuff.

322
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,560
You're allowed to talk
about sex and stuff.

323
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:57,890
Yeah.

324
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,251
Really?

325
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:58,550
Yeah.

326
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,220
How much so be level,

327
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,031
I mean,

328
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:02,700
not by B.

329
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,610
Can you talk about
popping pussies and stuff?

330
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,160
I know and I wouldn't,

331
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,023
it wouldn't go there.

332
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,451
What is it?

333
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:08,040
What is popping?

334
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,420
Posing.

335
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,380
That's what you snap it.

336
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,730
What do you do with your fingers?

337
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,091
No,

338
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:11,960
you just pop it.

339
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,100
How do you do that?

340
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,940
Just pop it.

341
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,481
What the fuck does,

342
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:14,751
I don't know.

343
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:16,010
What that means is songs about it.

344
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:16,191
You know,

345
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,480
two live crew pop that pussy.

346
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,020
Mm.

347
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,060
I think they just have fun.

348
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,310
Don't,

349
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,581
don't,

350
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:20,540
don't find that on Youtube.

351
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,130
Whatever you do is you
want to fingers moving.

352
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:22,670
Yeah.

353
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,180
Cut The shit.
