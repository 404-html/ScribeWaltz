1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,110
That sound that you hear, ladies
and gentlemen. It's not a real cat.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,570
That was actually me.
So if you're allergic to cats,

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,670
don't fucking freak out right now,
man.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,610
The joke will experience the
one with the fuck's going on.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,130
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by [inaudible] dot com.

6
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:24,480
Today's the last day today being Tuesday,
October 16th.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,380
If you use the, the, the, uh,
the codeword follow on it,

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,560
you'll save 20% off of any supplements.

9
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:35,670
If you follow them on Twitter and
you use that follow on it 20% off.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,100
No, no, no, no, no. You
know one either or do both.

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,070
20% is what I'm saying. Normally
it's double what the Code Brogan is.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,990
Wow. Yeah. So it was just today.

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,200
So go buy yourself some fucking pills
that make your brain better, dude.

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,790
All right. Get some, get some
shroom tech. Get some knew.

15
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,530
Mood knew mood is,
uh,

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,740
one of the best supplements that we have
because it really actually makes you

17
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:03,780
feel better. I mean, it sounds crazy,

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,350
but there are supplements that
enhance your brain chemistry.

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,280
That's not what they really sound like
when they're rolling around and magical.

20
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,101
But it is,

21
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:15,690
it's five f five HTP and the whole
trip to fan and it's got sort of a time

22
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:20,691
release quality to it because five HTP
is what turns into Serotonin and which

23
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:25,580
what your body uses to make
serotonin and l tryptofan.

24
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,870
It's what your body
converts in the five HTP.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,180
So there's like a time release aspect
of new mood and you take them at night.

26
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,390
Uh, you can take them during
the day too. But most people,

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,810
most people take it at night before
they go to bed and you'll feel great.

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,370
It helps the way you sleep,
it helps your dreams. Um,

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,210
Alpha brain will fuck with your
dreams for sure. That's one thing. If,

30
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:49,470
if we just sold them just as dream pills,

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,920
forget about what it can
do for your memory and uh,

32
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,900
all the other different shit
that they can do for him.

33
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,050
But just what it does for your dreams.
You'll have really trippy dreams.

34
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,550
Most likely meet for me.

35
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:03,270
They're much more lucid
and I remember them more.

36
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:05,610
For some reason my
retention is way better.

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,120
I took some last night and had crazy
dreams. Yeah. Yeah. What'd you dream?

38
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,390
I can't talk about it, but it's with Dan
at or on mine. Who's a friend of mine.

39
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:15,930
It was really awkward. It's
really awkward. The dream
about her sexually. Yeah.

40
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,790
That'd be funny.
If she wasn't a porn star.

41
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,200
That'd be hilarious if she wasn't in
like how many gang bang films this shit

42
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,870
done? They're like violent gang
bang one. So when you like her,

43
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:27,270
she's a nice person. Like,
oh, I enjoy being around her.

44
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,040
It wasn't like a sex dream like that.
It was like,

45
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,850
it was like a romantic dream that became
sexual and it was very awkward. Oh,

46
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,650
it was a romance.
A love thing.

47
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,120
You have some secret love and Alpha brain
brought it up. That's beautiful, man.

48
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,390
She, everybody needs love.
Even porn starts need love.

49
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,060
They need love more than anybody.
Maybe you're the guy, dude.

50
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,220
You're the guy to bring it out.
What do you do?

51
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,500
Do Animated Gifs in fucking audio.
Hey, I'm animated sparco gifts.

52
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:57,470
Please don't do that. Okay. For my
space. Bringing pays back pitches,

53
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,160
it's still up.
You can go.

54
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,200
Is this people on an everyday I logged
in the other day in the end, uh,

55
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:04,480
I was trying to do some
stuff and it was not working.

56
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:08,620
And then somebody said that that they're
selling my space and like restarting it

57
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,960
and you're just going to lose all
your stuff that was there. Oh.

58
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:13,110
So they're going to try a new company
is going to take it one more time.

59
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,320
Like could cool down know if that's true.

60
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:18,550
But it's what's making just with someone
told him. So does he Google it? No.

61
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,090
Ne He just reports. I don't even want
to Google my space. I'll ping it.

62
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,040
Well maybe I really don't give a fuck.
You're fucking shady. I love it. Uh,

63
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,160
on a.com he used the code name. This
is, well, by the time you hear this,

64
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,360
if it's on iTunes too late,

65
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,660
so you use a code name Brogan and he
was still save 10% off any and all

66
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,950
supplements we now have as of today,
the Blendtec blenders in um,

67
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,820
there significant in the last one that
with the manufacturer retail prices,

68
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,820
I think it's like when we sell them for
more than a hundred dollars less than

69
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:50,590
the retailers. Yeah, we're you, we're
trying to sell shit as cheap as possible.

70
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,211
The,
the,

71
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:56,010
the idea behind on it is to
sell you guys the best process.

72
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,490
Yeah. The, the actual price.

73
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:02,210
The MSRP is six 59 and we
sell them for four 54. Wow.

74
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:05,350
That's go the best possible shit
or the cheapest we can sell it.

75
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:08,620
So like the kettle bells, that's the best
possible kettlebells we couldn't buy.

76
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:12,220
They have nice fat handles are
excellent. We made, there's solid steel,

77
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:15,160
these fucking iron things.
They'll last forever.

78
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,720
You don't need to buy
them once in your life.

79
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,140
And these giant iron
cannonballs you swing around,

80
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,500
there'll be your extra exercise equipment
forever. Same with the battle ropes.

81
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:26,620
You never going to break him. They're
giant ropes that you use to make fucking,

82
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,060
they pull ships and shit.

83
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,870
You just whip these bitches around
and you get an awesome shape. So go,

84
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,070
go get on that. Go, go get
on it. Okay. Just do it.

85
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,160
Oh Brian going to make an animated
one of that and we need, I know Brian,

86
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,110
I know Brian animated like an
animated Gif if you do need to do,

87
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,510
I had a lot of fun playing with the
grass fed guy yesterday. He was awesome.

88
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,880
He was a really cool and interesting
like I was smart as fuck.

89
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,280
It scared the shit out of me. I've
been thinking about it. It was like,

90
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,440
you know when you see a movie
and sometimes you're like,
God, that was good. Maybe.

91
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,020
Then there's other movies you see and
you think about it for like the rest of

92
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:05,450
the night. You wouldn't talk about
it while you're eating. You know?

93
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,400
It's kind of like that guy. Like I, I'm,

94
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,410
I want to listen to it again and try to
dissect what that guy was saying. Yeah.

95
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,100
Well let's talk about that later.

96
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,190
Let's get through this fucking
rancid commercial. We're stuck in.

97
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,580
Go buy some shit. Go to desk
squad. Dot TV and buy some shit.

98
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,750

though. You fuck heads. You missed out.

decides if you haven't seen Thompson
Thompson grow right now is like on fire.

106
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:52,820
This kid is fucking hilarious. He's, he's
one of the best comics in the country.

107
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:55,730
He isn't taught, if you want to talk
about like an underappreciated God.

108
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,160
It's hilarious. Thompson.
That's who I believe.

109
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,880
He doesn't get like talked
into consideration is like
the best comics out there.

110
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,610
He makes me laugh as much as anybody.
He's a beautiful man.

111
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,720
He's a sexy beast and he makes them
with Doug Benson and Tony Hinchcliffe,

112
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:10,700
it's gonna be read. It's going to

The end of the world show is still on.
Tickets are available. Go to live nation.

115
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:21,290
You could find them. You could find them
somewhere buried in my Twitter feed,

116
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,220

with a band, but they're so cool. How
could we not so honey, honey band,

118
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,270
Joey motherfucking Coco Diaz,
Doug,

119
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:35,990
Stan hope and me and it's December 21st,

120
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,680
2012 at the Wiltern theater in La and
shit's going to get crazy bitches.

121
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,880
Hey,
when is the Mayan calendar actual Cli on?

122
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,490
Where's the my own clock with actual
time? Is it like, is it, is it,

123
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,440
are there times at like 12 1212 or

124
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,450
don't think they ha ha.

125
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,740
I think you have to take their calendar
and then you have to corresponded to a,

126
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,950
our, our, you know, whatever it's
called. The green. What does the,

127
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,200
what does Arconic calendar called?

128
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,050
What is the technical term but Gorian
Gregorian. Yeah. So I don't think,

129
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,560
I don't think we should talk about
that in the middle of commodity. So

130
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,680
hire at dash primate Dotcom

primate is all monkeys and mushrooms

133
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,250

All right ladies and men, this podcast,

134
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:26,510
we're going to try to keep it as,

135
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,770
as light on the gloom and doom as
possible because the subject matter is

136
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:35,540
absolutely fucking hideous.
It's not tangible, right?
It's crap. Now, this wasn't a,

137
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,940
this isn't a when thanks though
for, sorry. Weeks of 10. One.

138
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,953
Okay.

139
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,953
Experience.

140
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,280
First of all, thank you guys
for enduring those commercials.

141
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,960
This is the least professional piece of
broadcast and you'll ever be a part of.

142
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,860
We're trying to be as minimalized and is,
uh,

143
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,040
easily dismissed as we can.
So we just,

144
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,190
it was just going to do bad stuff from
here on out. Yeah. Have signed to lay low.

145
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,990
There's too much bad
information out there.

146
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,170
The more I read about what's going on,

147
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:19,150
the more you read about the government
anymore. He read about corruption and,

148
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:24,140
and, and, and censorship and what,
what's really going on behind the scenes.

149
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:27,440
It's fucking depressing. Do you guys feel
that? Who I'm talking to is Abby Martin.

150
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,980
David Seaman. And I'm
sorry, David's kind of your,

151
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:34,820
what is the exact term is online
campaign campaign manager,

152
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:39,470
which named Buddy Dell.
Cameron. Tell Cameron, Dale
Dale Dale down pack like Dell,

153
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:42,860
like the computer. Right. Do you ever
use, do you use Dell Dell products?

154
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:44,730
We feel silly.
Uh,

155
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,410
if I was using like a rogue and laptop,
but going to that bitch, same name.

156
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:56,030
So I would feel weird about
that. Doesn't bother you. No.

157
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,200
Good for you man. I mean, I'm not sure
it's short for Cordell. Oh, Cordell. Oh,

158
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:05,650
okay. Okay. But I'm a junior and that's
just too confusing sometimes for my,

159
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,560
your father talk with a
southern accent police.

160
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:12,561
I guess that'd be awesome if he's Cordell
and Cordell for Dale Dale junior come

161
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:17,100
over here,
touchy you about life.

162
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,830
Um, you guys are all very young
and you're all very idealistic.

163
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,620
You're all very, uh, uh, you're, you're,

164
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,260
you're the new breed of
journalists and we're,

165
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:32,370
we're seeing this because of what's going
on because there's so much censorship

166
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:37,371
and because CNN and Fox News and they've
gotten to be what you got to think of

167
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:42,771
as untrustworthy sources in for the
simple fact that they don't concentrate on

168
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:47,190
everything. There's a lot of shit. It's
really important that they don't cover.

169
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,490
But meanwhile they'll find the
time to cover ridiculous shit.

170
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,890
They'll find the time to,

171
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,340
to cover some nonsense celebrity
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Story.

172
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,050
They'll find that time,
they'll fit it in,

173
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,650
but they won't find the
time to discuss the NDA.

174
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:05,910
They won't find the time to discuss these
buildings that they're making in Utah

175
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:09,690
where they're going to store everybody's
information that they need to be

176
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:12,060
discussing this. That's what
journalism is supposed to be for.

177
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,080
Everyone knows this now
and because of you guys,

178
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:21,081
because of this new breed of young
kids who grew up with the Internet,

179
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,350
he grew up with this massive access to
information and this model that they've

180
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:31,920
got in place for how shit runs is whack.
And it's not gonna work.

181
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,340
It's not going to work.
It's like almost like a religious model.

182
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,450
It's like you have to believe in it as
a religion and you have to trust the

183
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:43,380
government and full faith for it to
work at all. And the only way they're,

184
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:43,711
they're,

185
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:47,370
they're actually getting people to go
along with that is by connecting it to

186
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:50,700
religion that connected to,
to the really simple minded folks,

187
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,390
that whole God and government thing.
And you know, God's on our side.

188
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:57,900
And it really does become sort
of a religious, a variable.

189
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,870
It becomes like the
reason why it's working.

190
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:03,160
It's because we've got this
weird wacky thing in us.

191
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,970
We're willing to believe shit
that doesn't make any sense.

192
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,380
And there's a lot of you guys that are
coming up that aren't doing that. You're,

193
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:12,660
you're, you're standing up
and you're saying this is,

194
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,200
the information that you're getting
is not exactly what's happening.

195
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,110
And they're lying through omission also.
Yes.

196
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,300
It's not so much that they're running
stories saying don't worry about Nda.

197
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,870
It's that they're not covering it at all.
Yeah.

198
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,750
And I think that's something else
is more important. So instead it's,

199
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:31,470
let's talk about Mitt Romney's tax returns
from the 90s and let's not focus on

200
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:32,970
something that is happening right now.

201
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,240
How did that happen? How did they do or
they just bought and paid for? I mean,

202
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:37,750
what is it?

203
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,920
Some of them, I think that's,
yeah, I mean, it's, it's,
it's not for truth telling.

204
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:45,040
I mean, they can legally lie. So it's just
a profit making industry. They're not,

205
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,280
they're not supposed to
tell you the fucking news. I
mean, they sell shit to you.

206
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,810
They sell fear and they sell
sensationalism. That's what sells.

207
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,010
There's huge entertainment

208
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,850
value to it. And that's why
they have somebody watching it.

209
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,600
When did the sellout begin?

210
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,490
Yeah, during the deregulation
era when we had, you know,

211
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:06,810
it went from like 60 companies to now
five corporations control everything that

212
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,840
you see and read in the main stream
and general electric. I mean,

213
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:14,030
the biggest fucking weapons'
contractor owns MSNBC, NBC. So

214
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,140
ads running during news programs itself.
Like, I mean, it, it takes away from like,

215
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,180
the, the viewers aren't really the
customers anymore. The ad agencies are,

216
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:27,160
and the viewers were, we're more of, um,

217
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,840
you're the part of like a product because
that's their selling are, you know,

218
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,100
the fact that we're reviewing too.

219
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,630
So you think,
I mean,

220
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,380
well that would be actually a good way
to allocate government funds, right?

221
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:41,470
Wouldn't it be to have like an
independent news source that was funded

222
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:45,730
completely and totally by tax dollars and
had nothing to do with any commercials

223
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:50,020
whatsoever?
Is that what it actually is for Russia?

224
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,533
That's what you work for.

225
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,020
The Russian times is our t right? Russia
today. Rush it to them. I'm sorry.

226
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,920
Do they, um, are they accurate
with stuff that goes on in rush

227
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,450
that is questionable? Uh, they, you
know, it's like the BBC in London.

228
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,810
Um, so you're not going to cover Putin,
obviously, like very unfavorable,

229
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:14,490
you're probably not going to call it the
elections as being stolen or whatnot.

230
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,870
But in terms of rt America,
which is where I work,

231
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,680
we just focused wholeheartedly on American
foreign policy and domestic policy.

232
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:22,750
So that's really where my head's at.

233
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:25,570
I mean we don't see Russia going around
and colonizing the rest of the world.

234
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,840
So I'm kind of picking my
battles here and working for a,

235
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,720
they still, they still keep a
gangster in Russia. They're, yeah,

236
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,650
they're keeping it as gangster as any
like real evolve civilization can,

237
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,550
I mean, it's really good,
again, because of the Internet,

238
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,460
because of this access to information
that we have now and we're kind of really

239
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:47,650
seeing the true shape of these things.

240
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,820
Whereas before it was all
hidden behind. You know, nobody,

241
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,380
nobody had access to information. Nobody
knew about who, never who. I mean,

242
00:13:56,381 --> 00:14:00,160
how many people actually went through
the Warren Commission report and followed

243
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:04,300
up on all the inconsistencies. How many
people have actually like read a bill?

244
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,790
How many people have actually, it's, it's,
it's too confusing for people on that

245
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,980
broadcasters that are actually,

246
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:12,040
you're going to read it and
relay the information accurately.

247
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,000
Exactly.
So what should it be?

248
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:17,600
Should it be that the news
is completely noncommercial?

249
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,930
Should it be that the news
is state funded? So because,

250
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,600
but you can't tell these
fuckheads where to spend money.

251
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:27,020
That's the most annoying
thing about giving out taxes.

252
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:29,990
Some of the networks don't appear to
be the networks that are supposedly

253
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:33,830
operating for profit or making decisions
that are against their own commercial

254
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:38,390
interests to instead promote propaganda,
which is worrying. You look at like,

255
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,840
so NDA would have been a massive story
with a lot of viewers and a lot of hits

256
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:44,340
on the online side. Right. And
why wasn't that covered? You know,

257
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,910
Wiki leaks is a massive
story in every possible way.

258
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,780
So something's happening behind the scenes
that is not purely driven by profit.

259
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:51,614
It's by,

260
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,530
uh, um, what's the word,
by ideology. You know,

261
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:58,520
somebody who's being told or somebody
believes that this should not be shown to

262
00:14:58,521 --> 00:14:59,354
the public.

263
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,220
Yeah. That's where it gets really
scary is when it surpasses the,

264
00:15:02,221 --> 00:15:06,150
the a moneymaking like the paypal
thing when they tried to block funds to

265
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:07,170
Bradley Manning and you're like,

266
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:10,440
you're working against your interest to
make money and to try to fucking promote

267
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:15,180
some sort of government and make money
off of that green is easier to understand.

268
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,530
You know what you're talking about. Like,
yeah, it's, it's, it's really confusing.

269
00:15:19,531 --> 00:15:22,710
Like when you see these things like
the end date. For folks who don't know,

270
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,370
let's just give a brief overview of what
the NDA actually means to people just

271
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:33,480
so they know. We know why. Well,
they know, rather while we're upset,

272
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,340
why don't you just
explain it in that show?

273
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,450
Uh,
the NDA is normally passed every year.

274
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,310
It's our defense appropriations
bill. So, uh, pays for the troops,

275
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:48,870
salaries and all of our spending
overseas and various military things. Uh,

276
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,640
in this last year's bill in 2011,
they snuck in a provision section 10 21,

277
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,110
which appears to allow for
the imprisonment without
trial of American citizens

278
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,490
on suspicion alone. Uh, and that's
what has caused all the uproar.

279
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,670
Why was this thing snuck into something
that they pretty much need to pass?

280
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,780
Why did Obama claim that he wanted to
veto it? And then he withdrew his veto,

281
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:13,740
threatened sign it into law at like 11:30
PM on New Year's Eve when nobody was

282
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:17,850
paying attention. And then he
went to stay there. I said,

283
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,390
it was like the sneakiest move I've ever
seen in my lifetime from a president,

284
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,280
this single sneakiest move. And then
he issues a signing statement saying,

285
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:26,550
I did it, I have resin, I had reservations
about it, but I'm not gonna use it.

286
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,080
And you're like, okay, maybe he gets it.

287
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:30,990
Maybe you just had to sign it for some
reason that we don't know about a,

288
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:35,991
and then his lawyer's in court have tried
incredibly ferociously to hang on to

289
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:39,210
this power. We've seen two rounds of
that now and it's gotten very serious.

290
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:40,980
I think the next stop,
uh,

291
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:44,220
I mean it already went through a three
judge panel and the appeals court and

292
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:45,420
they ruled in his favor.

293
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,180
So we're getting pretty close to
the Supreme Court at this point.

294
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,670
I think they have to see another,

295
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,650
there's another round of something
that the appeals court can go through,

296
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,470
but it's scary that Obama
claims he doesn't want this.

297
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,520
And yet his lawyers are working very
diligently to make sure that he has it.

298
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,490
It appears to me that either they know
something that we don't know or there is

299
00:17:05,711 --> 00:17:10,711
a systematic sort of a psychosis involved
in governing people and when you're in

300
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,310
a position where you have the
power to tell people what to do,

301
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:19,690
it does not seem like a natural position
and it seems like this us versus them

302
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:22,270
mentality that can come come about it.

303
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:27,550
It gets to a point where they're willing
to sacrifice the lives of people that

304
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,840
are supposed to be on their team.

305
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,660
They're willing to do that in
order to push their agenda.

306
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,990
When you hear about stuff like that
and you hear about like the false flag

307
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:37,270
events and the planned false flag of act,

308
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,480
a false flag event that they were going
to do an ran about operation Northwoods

309
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:44,710
in the 60s yeah,
that's well documented,

310
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,950
well documented that they were going to
blow up a drone airliner and it on Cuba.

311
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,360
They were going to arm chub and friendly's
and have them attack Guantanamo Bay

312
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,120
and they were going to blame all this
shit on Cuba so we could go to war with

313
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:00,420
Cuba. There were just going to kill
people. They're going to kill Americans.

314
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,380
They were going to kill soldiers. They're
going to attack basis. You know? I mean,

315
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,250
they're easily could have
been in completely innocent
Americans that have died

316
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:11,400
because these guys wanted an
excuse to get into war. Well,

317
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:13,740
why the fuck would anybody
want to do that? What is that?

318
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:17,100
What is it where you would you be
a person who was in government?

319
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,380
You're supposed to be the
leader of these people,

320
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:23,130
but you're doing something
that's completely contrary
to the wants and needs of

321
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:24,060
any of the people.

322
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,750
I think leadership has become kind of
cannibalistic where they're like, okay,

323
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:29,640
we need to keep you safe,
but in order to do that,

324
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,260
you have to strip you of your rights.

325
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,210
You're destroying the things
that the terrorist supposedly
hate us for. You know,

326
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:39,210
you're taking away our core freedoms are
turning us into a Middle Eastern regime.

327
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,910
Yeah, but they're consciously
doing it. They're not.

328
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,330
They don't believe that she is doing
this. Who is the person? Who is the group?

329
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:48,530
What is, is it follow? The money
is at the top of the food truck

330
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,330
machine and incorporations
control the the body elect,

331
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,500
not not just any corporation, it's
defense contractors, defense contractors,

332
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:58,600
Monsanto.
There's a few a keynote,

333
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,970
but I didn't see insatiable
urge for more control.

334
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:03,640
I mean when you have the technology
at your fingertips and it's just

335
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:08,350
exponentially growing, you just want it.
The insatiable urge to control that to,

336
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:11,560
you know, if there's facial recognition
technology, you want to seize that.

337
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:14,740
You want to fucking tap into all that
shit and just have the grid just because

338
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:16,720
you can.
I think anything

339
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,340
become,

340
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,120
you can rationalize anything you know
for them as long as it's like supporting

341
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:24,600
the business interests of the United
States as opposed to like anything else.

342
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:28,320
Like I think that there one of them,
this is not a sickness

343
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,950
and then it could be so pervasive
that it could be thousands of people.

344
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:41,310
It could be where people working together
along with people that signed up for

345
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:45,180
the military to supposedly
protect, you know, this country.

346
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:47,970
They could be involved in this,
this nonsense.

347
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,990
People are hopped up on episodes of
homeland and then actually believe they

348
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,930
believe their own internal
memos that people like me,

349
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:58,890
journalists and independent politicians
who don't side with one party and people

350
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:03,060
who are like fucking college students
who have backpacks and little cameras to

351
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:06,480
record stuff, that those people
are potential terrorists.
It's absolutely insane.

352
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,080
You start believing their own lie. Yeah.
I mean it's just nobody challenged it.

353
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:12,480
Nobody is saying no, that's
bullshit. So over time people go,

354
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,760
maybe this is the way it is. Maybe,
maybe these people are terrorists.

355
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,010
They are undermining our
system, right? Maybe,

356
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,600
maybe journalists are terrorists who,

357
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,080
so why isn't this discussion
ever going mainstream? Why?

358
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:26,910
Why has this discussion
completely avoided? But even
like unlike Bill Maher show,

359
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,020
they don't talk about this. Like, I mean,

360
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,670
what we're trying to do is
turn the mainstream and away
from the TV and bring it

361
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:33,504
over to us.

362
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,530
Yeah. But even, I mean, yeah, Bill Maher's
broke is the line. A lot of tickets.

363
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,430
I mean, you've got to find new media
has bill Maher's and brought this up?

364
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,160
No, Bill Maher fucking pulled
out his giant checkbook.

365
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:51,161
Gave $1 million to Obama's fucking Super
Pac Dune though Mars totally toeing the

366
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:54,100
line. I mean it's sad, you know,

367
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,160
you can fall in line with so much of what
he says and at the end of the day he's

368
00:20:57,161 --> 00:21:00,520
just like, and that's why
you need to donate money to
Obama. And you're like, what?

369
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,430
Yeah, I don't get it. I mean
maybe it's to get guests on.

370
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,820
Maybe if it doesn't play the game,

371
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,910
you can't run a show the
way he wants to run a show.

372
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,890
I think it's a status symbol.
I think so.

373
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:14,760
I think people donate large amounts of
money to political campaigns just so that

374
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:19,020
people know that they did. Yeah,
you're right. Well, no, not everyone,

375
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,310
but I think a lot of people do that.

376
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,050
It's like philanthropy for like people
like charities, hunty philanthropists,

377
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,450
philanthropies, braggy and shit about
their philanthropy. Yeah, it's the same.

378
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,600
Same thing to me.
I think,

379
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,071
well,

380
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:34,830
here's the reason that the dialogue is
not inserted in the mainstream because

381
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,980
the problem with the media other than of
course the fact that it's controlled by

382
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:40,860
corporations and that it's partisan.
So it's divide and conquer.

383
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:44,310
I mean they bring up these really divisive
issues that no one can agree on in a

384
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:48,450
country of 380 million people just to
keep us fighting when really we can all

385
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:51,450
agree on the huge issues that we
don't want to fucking, you know,

386
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,240
invade the entire planet and spend,
you know,

387
00:21:54,241 --> 00:21:57,390
just waste millions and trillions
of dollars by killing people.

388
00:21:57,391 --> 00:22:01,030
I mean I think we can all agree on those
things, but they like to keep us a,

389
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:04,050
you know, fighting with each other. And
so you have these networks like MSNBC,

390
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,280
Fox News,
CNN,

391
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:09,870
they're all partisan and they all push
these narratives that don't broaden up

392
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,740
the scope to undermine the actual
rhetoric of the establishment line,

393
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:14,551
which is really,
you know,

394
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:18,210
they tow that line to keep people
in line and that's the problem.

395
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,940
They pull abortion out of the pocket
cause that's the way it's not going to be

396
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:22,470
resolved next month or next year.

397
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,400
It's always going to be something we're
47 or 48% of the people believe this one

398
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:30,600
thing and 47 or 48% of the people
believe this one thing and then two or 3%

399
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:32,300
don't really give a shit.
Gay Rights and abortion,

400
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,260
everything's going to be like
that until the end of the time.

401
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,040
Yes. It will never make
marriage legal federally ever.

402
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,980
They won't because then they
lose that thing to argue about.

403
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,630
It's like they'll always figure out a way
to make that a stupid issue that comes

404
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:47,000
up.

405
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,220
Well that's what I was
telling them last night.

406
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:52,300
Like I think maybe a lot of conservative
politicians don't really want abortion,

407
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,080
um,

408
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,710
to be illegal because it would take away
like the one big polarizing issue that

409
00:22:56,711 --> 00:23:00,210
they have with their, with
their bring brings the ground
springs, the crowds like,

410
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:01,044
yeah.
I mean

411
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,780
did he wrote Dajani laid the Tennessee
who is like pro life and then force his

412
00:23:05,781 --> 00:23:07,670
mistress to have an abortion.
Pretty fucking funny.

413
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:13,400
Sounds like a classy caught up on that
shit. I'm like outlawed contraception,

414
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:16,220
but he had put a bill through to
fund like animal contraception.

415
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,780
It's all this self loathing game.

416
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,611
Yeah,

417
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:22,180
you've got to worry about anybody that
really cares that other people were doing

418
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:24,940
things that have no effect on them and
you wrap it up in your religion and

419
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:25,810
whatever you want to wrap it up.

420
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:28,330
Then if you're going after
people for what they enjoy doing,

421
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:30,960
there's something wrong with you.
It's just that simple. Right.

422
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,620
Saw the bill of rights.
Such an important thing.

423
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,620
You have these rights
doesn't really matter to me.

424
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,510
The government thinks that it would
make us safer to take them away.

425
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:41,560
That's not what you can do.
This is the safest time we've ever known.

426
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,070
There's never been more safety.
There's never been like a peace America.

427
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,040
We could go even in this
fucking terrible economy,

428
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,510
like it's safer to live today than it
has been to ever live ever on earth.

429
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,320
You know? And we still act like
the fucking sky is falling.

430
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,410
We're going to snatch away rights
and build up military camps.

431
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,460
Will you know what it is? Man?
It's not even red scare. I mean,

432
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,720
what it is is,
uh,

433
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,450
a business that's trying to
stay in business and there's
only one way to stay in

434
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,470
business. You got to ramp up the
fucking military action side.

435
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,390
You want to make a lot of money
and sell a lot of fucking tanks.

436
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,800
I one ramp up the military action bringing
home our number one export weapons.

437
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:24,200
How the fuck can we still, you
know, we have to sell that shit.

438
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:25,250
We have to sell that shit.

439
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,420
They're selling tanks were just sitting
there collecting dust that we don't use.

440
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,410
There's massive, massive amounts of
money. We make iPods and Predator drones,

441
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,990
we don't even mail make the iPods
designed in California.

442
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,370
Well in Brazil I was just in Brazil and
apparently they make iPods and iPhones

443
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:47,430
there as well. So if you bring one over,
like if you're a Brazilian and you have,

444
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:51,290
when they want to make sure that you
didn't go and buy an American one and then

445
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:54,860
come over to Brazil because that fucks
with their economy because the Brazilian

446
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:57,500
ones are like a little bit more expensive.
So I guess they give you a hard time.

447
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,870
It's like this thing of the Supreme
Court is looking at this fall,

448
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,550
the first sale doctrine, uh, where uh,

449
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:06,590
it could challenge your right to resell
like your iPhone or your car or anything,

450
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,560
anything that you've bought. You'd
have to get permission from like Ford,

451
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:13,340
can I resell this car to this third
party now that I no longer wanted? What?

452
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,040
Because uh,
you should bring up the details of it.

453
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:19,190
I'm going to mess up the details.
It's really sick about that.

454
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:22,280
Is it only really affects businesses
and or like small businesses,

455
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,720
it doesn't really affect like,

456
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,260
I mean of course I could always walk next
door and saw my car to my neighbor so

457
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:28,790
it's not really going
to affect me personally,

458
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:31,840
but it's going to just like trash a
bunch of Internet, it's going to destroy.

459
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,740
There's Ebay would immediately go.

460
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,400
There's an issue with electric cars
as well that people aren't taking any

461
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:39,091
consideration.

462
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:42,450
A lot of people think there's some how
or another going to be free from Karma if

463
00:25:42,451 --> 00:25:44,430
they get an electric car.
One of it,

464
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,130
it takes a lot of oil to build
and make an electric car.

465
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:52,170
But two is electric cars run on lithium
ion batteries and lithium ion batteries

466
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:55,560
come from places like the Congo and a lot
of times they're dug out of the ground

467
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:58,020
by little kids and that's
just a fucking fact.

468
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:00,660
And you can use your laptop
and your cell phone all day,

469
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,490
but it's very likely that somewhere
along the chain someone was abused.

470
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,900
I mean literally down to like the
most inhuman type thing you do.

471
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,400
Like you turn someone into a slave,

472
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:15,450
you turn someone in the working slave for
you, you make them do that. Like that.

473
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,110
The breakdown of the highest expression
of technology we have available.

474
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,940
If you follow its path at the end of it,

475
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:22,770
as a kid in Africa digging in the ground,

476
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,610
it's really hard to corporate just
in like a world. It's so like, yeah.

477
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:31,470
And also a big place where they
found a gigantic stash of lithium is

478
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:34,150
Afghanistan. The trillion
dollar minerals. Yeah.

479
00:26:34,151 --> 00:26:35,770
So there's a reason why they're there.

480
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,510
There's a bunch of reasons why they want
to control Afghanistan and almost none

481
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:42,240
of them have to do with some dudes and a
dressed up like during the fucking star

482
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:47,070
wars movie, San People,
thousand dudes with guns.

483
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,410
That is not why we're there.
That's fucking bananas.

484
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:51,660
If you believe that you're
absolutely out of your fucking mind.

485
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,830
There's a massive amount of heroin
there and there's a massive amount of

486
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:59,010
minerals and the heroine is the craziest
one because that's the one that makes

487
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:01,860
people go, oh, you just
crossed into crazy land son.

488
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,220
Do you think the United States government
would be involved in selling heroin?

489
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,450
You know what? We don't
grow it here. So yeah,

490
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,200
I don't see a lot of it around
pharmaceutical companies
need to opium late techs

491
00:27:12,201 --> 00:27:16,530
to manufacturer pills and the
Pharma lobby is fucking huge here.

492
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:21,480
And I mean opn, 90% of the world's
heroin comes from Afghanistan now. Yeah.

493
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:25,380
And we know when I talked to Shane Smith
from vice.com he was breaking down from

494
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:26,550
me in numbers.

495
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:30,600
How much more heroin is available
now and how easy it is to get.

496
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:32,280
And it's a direct correlation.

497
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,790
Cine United States being involved with
Afghanistan, that's when it started.

498
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,700
It's like so transparent.
It's just in your face.

499
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,960
There's videos of soldiers walking down
poppy fields with machine guns and for

500
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:46,860
the soldiers, they must feel like this
is not what I fucking king here for.

501
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:49,410
You know, I thought I was going
over here to fight bad guys.

502
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,270
I mean mom protected poppy seed.

503
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,770
What's crazy is I've seen a lot of people,
uh,

504
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,620
who are excited before they go over there.

505
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,450
I've yet to read a single
account and you know,

506
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,770
a credible publication saying like,

507
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,960
I went over there and it was
a great experience. You know,

508
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,950
I haven't seen that at once.
Not even one time.

509
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,600
You think if that happened that they
would promote that a lot. You know,

510
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,990
but I never hear that
and maybe it's out there.

511
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,170
I'm sure like one of your listeners
has had that, but I don't hear that.

512
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,150
I hear horrific stories. I heard a lot
of horrific stories from Iraq as well.

513
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,430
There's a guy, uh, there's, you know,

514
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:24,750
there's videos of these veterans that
sit down, I forget the name of the group,

515
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,060
a rack.
It might be that,

516
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,750
but he was just telling all the different
stories of the people they killed and

517
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:34,820
why they killed him and
how they're, uh, sergeant,

518
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,080
whoever it was was going to
give them extra days off.

519
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,680
They killed somebody with a knife,
you know,

520
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,840
and you hear shit like this and
you're like, whoa. Like this is like,

521
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,440
they're just promoting like a bunch of
assassins to just run through streets and

522
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:47,880
kill people.
You know,

523
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:51,150
they seen the photos of people
holding a little kid's head up,

524
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:54,210
the kids like naked and he shot and
the guy smiling next to him, like,

525
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:58,860
you just shot a deer. Have you seen that?
Yeah, man, that's, that's our soldiers.

526
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,030
You know, if that's at all
possible, even even for one guy,

527
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,240
we need to hit the brakes on this thing
and figure out what the fuck we're doing.

528
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,330
Because it's not just that
we're making money. Okay.

529
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,540
It's not just someone's making money,
they're making psychos. They're making,

530
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,760
they're making people that are probably
never going to be the same again.

531
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,620
Look at what they do to the,
some of the inmates at Guantanamo,

532
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,820
they put them in a sensory deprivation.
And then this one dude in 2006,

533
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:26,650
he had to see a dentist, I think his
name is Jose Padilla. And, and uh,

534
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,540
when he was out in the outside world,

535
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,890
they put headphones on him and goggles so
that he could not see or hear anything.

536
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,400
And he started going into convulsions
because his mind is so fucked at this

537
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:37,840
point from no,
no,

538
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,100
no stimulation over a course of like a
year or something that he's just totally

539
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:44,950
gone inside.
And when he spoke with his lawyers,

540
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:48,670
he thought that they were interrogators
pretending to be lawyers. So he's like,

541
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:50,580
he's gone. They can't,
they can't even let it go.

542
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,860
Let that go because you've totally
fried his mind. And now he,

543
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,420
if he wasn't before,
now he certainly is a fucking psycho.

544
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,680
How long did they have them
in there like that for?

545
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,600
Uh, I don't want to miss
like give you the wrong time,

546
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:03,840
but it's a lot like a long time.
Like hundreds or thousands. Yeah.

547
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,000
Well the media likes to paint
these people was like, oh,

548
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:07,650
they're just a few bad apples,
you know,

549
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,110
England or whatever the
fuck that woman's name was.

550
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:12,750
He was like pointing at the dude with
the hood on his face. And you're like,

551
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:17,250
but Rumsfeld's tort, like memos circling
Shit. And he's like more of this,

552
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,520
more of this. I mean, it's totally fucking
systemic. And the chain of command,

553
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:21,540
I mean,
these people are,

554
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,970
you're going to place a
lot of the blame on the,

555
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,550
on the people that are keeping the
soldiers over there because you've got to

556
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:28,550
imagine like being in a war
zone for that extended period.

557
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,520
Now I'm not like excusing the, some
of the most more horrific acts. Like,

558
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:36,110
obviously that's, you know, those people
had some issues before they got there.

559
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,010
But, um, you know,

560
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:40,250
if you keep those soldiers over there
for what had been at war for a decade,

561
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,100
I mean eventually, you know,
it's going to, cause, I mean,

562
00:30:43,101 --> 00:30:46,820
I'm sure there's the number of people
coming back with psychological issues is

563
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,590
skyrocket.

564
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,910
I'm sure I'll continue to go up to
outnumbered deaths in battle. Yeah.

565
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:54,190
Isn't that incredible that
just, that number alone? I mean,

566
00:30:54,191 --> 00:30:57,550
has that been this discussed?
No, I seriously doubt.

567
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,510
How could you not talk about that?
That's a big issue. It's a huge issue.

568
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,540
It should be on the,

569
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,620
because they want to pretend like the
government gives a shit about the troops.

570
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,130
That's why the whole
thing's very shocking.

571
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,910
It's very shocking when you got this far

572
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,160
that comes back to Nda and because some
of the funding for the NDA covers like

573
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:17,590
veterans benefits for veterans.

574
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:20,830
And so it's when they're talking
about attacking on ride ons,

575
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:24,880
like the indefinite detention section,
um, they're basically holding,

576
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,810
um, like veterans'
benefits and pay for, um,

577
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,340
for soldiers like hostage.
And they're like, you know,

578
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,610
we have to pass this through. Or they're
using it as an excuse like Obama did.

579
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,520
Like we have to pass this
through otherwise are

580
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,160
veterans are our, you know,
our soldiers aren't you?

581
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,960
You get paid and like,

582
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,900
well why don't you just remove that
and we'll go ahead and say, okay,

583
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,850
how is it legal to package a bunch
of shit together and have it count?

584
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,940
Welcome to Congress believably ridiculous,

585
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,820
shove things in there that make no sense,

586
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,680
that are like really bad and shove it
into something called the Patriot Act

587
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,850
second earlier about the knee,
how they, how they name buildings.

588
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,420
And like there's one where it
basically like, um, it makes, uh,

589
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,870
ISP Internet service providers like
log all of your activities so that the

590
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:14,170
government, like whatever, like the
FBI could access that if it needed to.

591
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,050
I think it's like a period
of two years and the,

592
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,800
that's what the bill does
and what the bill was called.

593
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:23,250
It was like the child protecting,
protecting children from predators,

594
00:32:23,251 --> 00:32:25,850
molesters act, you know, and like,
who's going to vote against that?

595
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,850
If you vote against it, they'll slam
you in the media. Of course, like,

596
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:31,620
like Fox News for election,
the commercial is going to be like,

597
00:32:31,621 --> 00:32:36,250
he voted against the anti child
Molester Act. He loves pedophile. Yeah.

598
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:40,460
Obviously. What I wanted to
say really fast about the, um,

599
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,240
what's so crazy about it is they
have these ride ons or add ons.

600
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:47,390
The section 10 21 and Obama
supporters claimed that, well, he was,

601
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,520
he was shoved in a corner. If
he didn't, if he didn't sign it,

602
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:52,550
some Republicans would have criticized
him is if they're not already criticizing

603
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:54,800
the shit out of him.
Like if you were to have a president,

604
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:57,920
Ron Paul behind that desk or a president,
uh,

605
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,150
Gary Johnson or President Joe
Rogan, anybody, uh, you'd be,

606
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:03,800
you'd be handed that and you'd say,
no thanks.

607
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:05,630
I'm going to veto this until
this shit is out of there.

608
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,580
And if the Republicans
had an issue with it,

609
00:33:07,581 --> 00:33:09,050
you would've gone to the press and said,
look,

610
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,980
this section cannot be signed into law.
I'm not holding them.

611
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,740
When they say like, don't hate
the player, hate the game.

612
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,600
You should also maybe hate the player a
little bit cause he fucking signed it.

613
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:20,510
It would not exist without his signature.

614
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:25,511
So for people to totally ignore the
Obama involvement in this is I think

615
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,210
dishonest.

616
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:26,750
So how,

617
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,750
how is it possible that so many people
could agree with this and want to sign it?

618
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,100
How was that possible that I could got
get to that point where they would draft

619
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,330
something where they would

620
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,630
behind closed doors, that section, I
think it was done behind closed doors.

621
00:33:38,631 --> 00:33:42,320
So it's not like they pulled the American
people in on a episode of American

622
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:42,591
idol.

623
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:45,680
It was like we got 85% response saying
we need to imprison you thought trial.

624
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:47,210
It's like a couple of old dudes,

625
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:51,650
Senator Mccain and Senator Carl Levin
decided that this is what America needs

626
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,840
and then before you know it,
this is what American needs.

627
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,440
I feel like they like gave Obama like
the opportunity to try to save face by

628
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:59,680
like saying he was going to
veto it and like how could,

629
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,110
how now could you like look at it and
think that he ever had any intention of

630
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:03,760
doing that?
Right.

631
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,930
It will still have mental gymnastics.
People are like, oh, but he's, you know,

632
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:11,250
he's doesn't want it that Dah Dah, Dah.
He's just the benign brand of the empire.

633
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,660
I mean that's really what I'm online.

634
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,650
Why would he be fighting
against Mitt Romney Spotify

635
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,320
playlist? That's basically
what it is, is the drone king.

636
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,980
So do you think that we got tricked
into thinking that Obama was something

637
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:25,760
different by just what he looked like
and the fact that he didn't have much

638
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:29,960
history to go back on and you know,
we just, idealistically I was like,

639
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:31,850
well this is the guy.
He's young. The pressure.

640
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,110
Yeah, it was the pressure valve from
Bush. People were like, yeah, fuck yeah,

641
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:38,230
like African American president.
And he's like, has awesome rhetoric.

642
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,710
But if you really analyze what he was
saying he was promoting, you know,

643
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,520
expanding the war in Afghanistan.
I mean he really, but yeah,

644
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:48,760
I sold a fucking billion dollar
ad campaign. Hope and change, Bro.

645
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,280
You also like to change
and some of the campaigns,

646
00:34:51,281 --> 00:34:52,810
there's one in 2000 wouldn't want that.

647
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,980
Yeah. And in 2007, he said, uh,

648
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,360
if even one Arab American is the Tange
without a trial that affects my liberties.

649
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,200
And uh, like you can pull up that video
where he says that and you're like,

650
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,030
what about the NDA?
Like now you're,

651
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,810
what do they do to them when they get
them an office that gets them to behave

652
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:13,530
like this? Is there something or are they
just all full of shit? Is it they're,

653
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,620
they're all full of shit and
by the time they get there,

654
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,740
it's just they've been so good at being
full of shit for so long and they've

655
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,800
kept the record clean and they, they're
going to pull off the big position.

656
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,680
Is that it?

657
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,740
I don't think the parties would promote
a candidate that they didn't think it

658
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:26,820
would eventually fall in line.

659
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,730
Well,
it's not even a party is its banks.

660
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,340
I mean Goldman Sachs was the
top donor to Obama's campaign.

661
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:33,930
He's now that they're not at the top donor
to Romney's campaign. So I mean it's,

662
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,640
it's all just a favor doubt

663
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,020
though.
Do you think that they get and they say,

664
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,853
listen dude,

665
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,450
you got to just do what we say and if you
do what we say we're going to keep you

666
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:46,610
moving along. But if you don't do what
we say, you know it's over. Cause that,

667
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,900
is that like a real
conversation they have.

668
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,870
I don't think there's like a smoky
room went dude saying like Yo,

669
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,730
here's the fucking JFK real,
you know,

670
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,740
video of JFK getting assassinate. I just
think it's the, the corporate machine.

671
00:35:57,741 --> 00:35:59,750
I mean you know what you have to do,

672
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:04,010
you know the game you have to play in
order to put Nigga shit pass and fucking

673
00:36:04,011 --> 00:36:04,844
hold your head up.

674
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,680
But they just like guarantee.

675
00:36:06,681 --> 00:36:10,130
I mean they just trust him to
keep going along those lines.

676
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,900
It seems kind of crazy to me.

677
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,380
It seems kind of crazy that you can
see as much of what's wrong with the

678
00:36:17,691 --> 00:36:18,031
government.

679
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:21,890
That's Obama must be able to see it
must go to save the horrors of the war.

680
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:25,310
He's a smart guy. I mean, he's
not an old fucked up dude.

681
00:36:25,311 --> 00:36:28,250
He's a guy that's in touch.
He's gotta be paying attention.

682
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:30,470
He's gotta be looking at
these suicide numbers.

683
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,570
He's got to be looking at
this horrific situation,

684
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,460
this saber rattling for
going to war with Iran. Him.

685
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:40,340
He has to be looking at this in Har. I
think part of it is bad advisors. I mean,

686
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,940
look at who he's surrounded by. These
aren't, these aren't new young people.

687
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,880
These are like the same people.
There are the establishment.

688
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,713
A lot of these people,

689
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,750
so maybe he's so insulated like he used
to talk about like I don't want to wind

690
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:54,120
up in a bubble and now he's most
definitely in a bubble. He goes on,

691
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,280
if you were to go on Msnbc,

692
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:59,600
they would just kiss his ass for 30
minutes and not mention NDA wants as the

693
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:01,340
idea of a president.
Ridiculous.

694
00:37:01,341 --> 00:37:04,520
Do we need to abandon it because
it seems ridiculous to me.

695
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:09,550
It seems like one guy representing the
entire country is a silly monkey thing.

696
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,430
It's a silly alpha male. She'll
be a bunch of jet eyes, you know,

697
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,510
a bunch of smart people all sitting around
in a circle, kind of like 20 people.

698
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:21,210
A bunch of dudes that have done the cave
as a bunch of people who've done that

699
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:24,830
Dave Asprey brain thing. Yeah. That
is what congress is supposed to be,

700
00:37:24,831 --> 00:37:25,664
but it's not,

701
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,810
they're acting outside of
their mandate as a government.

702
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:32,810
Like a lot of the things that they're
doing right now, there's really no,

703
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,730
like it's everything that they're doing,

704
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:38,030
it's like unconstitutional and we're
just so used to like putting up with it.

705
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,510
It's hard to call them.
There's so many,

706
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:42,940
and we're getting like flooded with
these bills that are obviously,

707
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:45,700
they're all unconstitutional and every
once in a while they slipped one through

708
00:37:45,701 --> 00:37:50,110
it. It's all the idea behind it is
what's completely UNAMERICAN, you know?

709
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,940
Uh, we, we have this idea of
what, you know, what America's
supposed to stand for.

710
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:59,590
At least we used to, that that idea is
getting eroded, eroded more and more.

711
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:02,200
You pay attention to what's
really going on in the world.

712
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:05,850
It's a sad time to be alive
in that sense that it's,

713
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:10,860
we have so much going for us where we're
so technologically advanced were so we

714
00:38:11,351 --> 00:38:13,990
were able to communicate with each other
and exchange information in ways that

715
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,530
have never been possible before
for any human being ever.

716
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:22,180
And yet we're still
living like fucking crazy.

717
00:38:22,181 --> 00:38:25,870
Barbarians were still launching
rockets and to villagers,

718
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,610
I mean these double tap drones,

719
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,310
the fact that we're not there and we
don't see it doesn't mean that what you're

720
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:34,210
doing isn't fucking terrifying.
Horrific murderer, shit,

721
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,670
feminism to double tap,
oh, it's a double tap.

722
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,500
What that means is they shoot the drones
into the building and then they come

723
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:44,950
back like 20 minutes later and shoot
again because people have gathered up to

724
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:45,780
get rid of the,

725
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,430
the sick people in the target mourners
and people who are like combating the

726
00:38:49,431 --> 00:38:54,431
sick and wounded and drones have a 2%
success rate to fucking percent success

727
00:38:54,621 --> 00:38:59,240
rate. So that kind of deterred underminded
that whole logic like drones or the

728
00:38:59,241 --> 00:39:01,610
strategic,
they're surgically precise now.

729
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:06,300
They're not at all 2% are think
one in 47 something like that.

730
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,620
End Up on the wrong dudes excel
spreadsheet, a Predator drone headed.

731
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,810
But how crazy is that idea that you can
murder 47 people as long as you get the

732
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,720
one right guy. And that's,
that's, and by the way,

733
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:21,410
thousands of people died like this. The
right guy. Like who is this fucking guy?

734
00:39:21,411 --> 00:39:24,740
We haven't put him on trial. Fuck. Are
these people that were killing anyway,

735
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,790
relabeled the term militant basically
defined it to include just any,

736
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,820
anyone of that could be of age.

737
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,690
They're so low Custer to be like
part of like one of these groups.

738
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,140
They're shooting fucking
rockets from the sky in robots.

739
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:45,790
That is the most ridiculous shit ever.
They're fighting pre crime. They're like,

740
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:48,940
these people look suspicious. They're
definitely doing some militant like, shit,

741
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,340
let's just get rid of all of them.
You know?

742
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,270
It's a weird way to turn
a human into a number.

743
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,170
It's just bizarre that because we
don't see it within a footage of it,

744
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:02,530
we're not there. What's happening? It's
not happening over here. We're just like,

745
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:02,861
oh yeah,

746
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:07,861
we use drones and it's so relaxed or
opinion on is that Obama can make jokes

747
00:40:08,711 --> 00:40:10,540
about it.
Like remember when he does,

748
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:17,770
he was joking about dating his daughters
and he said, I've got two words for you.

749
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:21,760
Predator drone. That'd be funny if
he didn't actually have mean. Yeah.

750
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,650
It'd be funny if thousands
of people hadn't died already
because of these things.

751
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:30,550
A lot of them, most of them innocent.
I mean, and he's joking about it.

752
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:34,510
Like what kind of weird disconnect is
that I give her if you're just a regular

753
00:40:34,511 --> 00:40:36,940
dude and people would say, oh, you're
being sensitive. It's just a joke.

754
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,520
That's a crazy thing to joke about.
You know?

755
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,960
That's like Lizzie Borden joking about
access. You know, it's a little touchy.

756
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,890
That's a weird joke. Zero transparency
with those types of kills too. I mean,

757
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:50,720
you don't know who you hit. It's hard to
get. Got to move up to the microphone.

758
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,200
Sorry, I want to talk. Yeah,

759
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:55,030
I was saying like there's zero
transparency involved with that type of

760
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:55,571
technology.

761
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:58,710
There's no way for us to like confirm
who we killed or who was down there and

762
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,000
every organization help her number.
We don't go back to help them. Sorry.

763
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:04,990
We had to kill this one dude.

764
00:41:04,991 --> 00:41:07,270
I started with fucked up
everybody and blew up your babies,

765
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,880
but we had to get this one dude.
Now we're going to help, you know,

766
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:10,540
there's no help.

767
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,350
They're just robots from the Scottish
shoot rockets and they call the rockets

768
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,440
hell fire missiles. Like, wow.

769
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,070
How crazy is this? A domestic drone thing?
The thing that scares me the most of,

770
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,840
of course, aside from the spine grid
that's going to be surveilling all of us.

771
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,600
Um, you can, you can hijack these rounds.

772
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:32,320
So people who are just hackers can just
hijack these fucking domestic drones and

773
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:35,450
use them as like,
that to me is fucking terrifying.

774
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,400
Crazy hacker can hijack the drone and
tell it the slim knew his girlfriend's

775
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:44,130
apartment.
Exactly.

776
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:50,840
That's going to happen. I
mean, that Shit's real. Yeah,
right. No kidding. How Sad.

777
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,400
How sad is it that our technology's
evolving and exponentially growing by the

778
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:57,980
second yet were stunted consciously.

779
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,900
Our F our evolutionary consciousness is
stunt into these archaic paradigms that

780
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:06,680
just are just mechanisms of control,
social control, fucking religion,

781
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,930
political ideology. It's like, dude,

782
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:12,890
we are applying to a system that does
not like we are living in a system that

783
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:14,660
does not apply to Myron society anymore.

784
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,010
It's strange how it just sort
of snuck up on us too. You know?

785
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,730
It's strange how there was like
this disdain for Nixon likes.

786
00:42:20,731 --> 00:42:25,400
He sort of represented a,
an unsavory dishonest character.

787
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,421
And then,
you know,

788
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:31,400
Gerald Ford was kind of bumbling and
then Ronald Reagan was loved and hated at

789
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:35,630
the same time and now people go
completely gotten loony on who,

790
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,830
who he was and what he stands for.
And then it goes from there too.

791
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,190
It starts getting a little shady
with Herbert Walker Bush goals,

792
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:47,090
shady with the fucking former president
of CIA running a government with what's

793
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:49,550
going on. How's that guy? The
President? He was a little weird.

794
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,510
And then it goes from that to
Clinton. Oh, we're back. Look at this.

795
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:56,940
We got this guy, you know,
this guy, smart as fuck. He's,

796
00:42:56,941 --> 00:43:01,400
he's a brilliant man and he says that
he's so such a charismatic speaker and we

797
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:04,460
have prosperity,
economic prosperity while he's in office.

798
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,181
So there's a little thing,

799
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:08,540
social disturbances from him getting
caught in affairs and stuff like that,

800
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:10,400
but all in all a good run.

801
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,610
And then the shit fucking hits the skids.

802
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:18,790
And then our entire view of what being
American changes on September 11th from

803
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:19,874
then on,

804
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,440
it goes from anger to confusion too.

805
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,680
You feel like you got tricked.
It goes from anger.

806
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:31,610
That American was attacked to confusion
as to why we going over there.

807
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,110
Two years later,

808
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,780
we're still there and it doesn't make
any sense and it has nothing to do with

809
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:38,810
September 11th and you're like,
wow, what the fuck? What happened

810
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,720
to almost accurate,
what's the word I'm looking into?

811
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,190
Just the best system that we
have now. It's just like, well,

812
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,150
he's better than Romney.

813
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:50,650
What's so crazy about the nine 11
situation when you think about it? Uh,

814
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,570
I interviewed this guy,
David Brin,

815
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:55,390
who wrote a book about
like transparent societies.

816
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,630
And on one of the pages of his
book, he was like, let's just,

817
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,300
this is years before nine 11 he's like,
just as a hypothetical,

818
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,810
let's imagine that some terrorist,
some terrorists,

819
00:44:03,811 --> 00:44:06,700
a blow up the World Trade Center,
take down the twin towers.

820
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,760
What would the government do in
response with the federal government do?

821
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,310
And he basically outlines the
fucking Patriot Act. He's like,

822
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,310
this is what they would do and
this is what it would devolve into.

823
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:19,780
And then that actually happened and
this guy has the only solution I've ever

824
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:20,500
heard.

825
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,110
I don't know if it would actually work
because there are a lot of impediments to

826
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:26,620
this working, but the solution is
we can't turn off the surveillance.

827
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:28,690
We can't turn off the
technological progress.

828
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,800
What we can do though is use it
against the gut, not it against, but

829
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,860
make it a two way street.
Like instead of surveillance,

830
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:38,370
he calls it suveillance where you're just
walked. Everybody's watching everyone.

831
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:41,460
So if we were going to have trap wire and
surveillance cameras and all this shit,

832
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:42,000
fine.

833
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,300
But then we want to also be able to look
in there and if it's supposed to be to

834
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:49,740
keep us safe, why isn't more people a
good thing? Why isn't crowdsourcing this?

835
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:50,873
Why isn't that good?

836
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,850
I think eventually it's inevitable that
we're going to get to a position just

837
00:44:54,851 --> 00:44:58,090
technologically speaking and where
everyone's going to be accessible to

838
00:44:58,091 --> 00:44:58,924
everybody. Yeah. No,

839
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:04,240
it seems like that's what the
obvious trend is. I mean, it's gone.

840
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:07,000
Whatever we are,
whatever new technologies are created,

841
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:08,200
they're not enhancing privacy.

842
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:11,220
The new technologies are almost
always enhancing connectivity there.

843
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:14,680
Everybody's able to access
each other easier and quicker,

844
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:18,910
and Tumbler and Facebook days of your life
will be on Netflix where you could go,

845
00:45:18,911 --> 00:45:21,850
I want Joe Rogan Thursday from
three o'clock to four o'clock

846
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:25,600
what's he doing? Yeah. No
people like, Oh my God,

847
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:29,650
I love watching your life
watching streaming. Nice, Bro.

848
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,290
Well, they're going to get crazier
than that Google thing. Whatever it is.

849
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,780
I can literally watch you like pissing
into a urinal and then put that up on

850
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:44,710
youtube and like that.
Yeah, for sure. Absolutely.

851
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:48,980
It's like you could call it the piste
diaries every night. We know. Yeah.

852
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,410
You only turn it on when you go into the
cam and he just, this is me pan again.

853
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,700
It's 1132 more hundred gins and uh,

854
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,170
Phillip kind of a bitch and people were
thinking of doing blokes to keep coming

855
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:03,590
to here, but I'm just being, it would
be like the popular one. Like wow,

856
00:46:03,591 --> 00:46:04,940
that guy's really honest about his pen.

857
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,720
I like following him that being
glasses are going to be so awful.

858
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,960
The being glasses,
he's just going to be doing gps.

859
00:46:11,961 --> 00:46:15,020
They're just going to shoot it
into your ivy billion cameras.

860
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,570
I'm going to watch everything
that goes on inside and outside.

861
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:22,400
He'll come through your skin RFID chips
in their student Ids and like punishing

862
00:46:22,401 --> 00:46:25,380
them, monitoring their
bathroom time. Right.

863
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:29,030
Well your story ideas that they want
to be able to find kids, you know,

864
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,240
at least these are people that are,
you know,

865
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:36,410
under 18 and they have to be looked after
and there's safety considerations and

866
00:46:36,411 --> 00:46:38,000
it's not like we're
making them wear a chip,

867
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:39,920
like inside their skin or anything crazy.

868
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:45,260
But that's always been there and I'm like,
why now do we like,

869
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,830
is it more dangerous to go to school now
than it used to be like somebody got a

870
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:52,090
contract to make these
chips and put them into you.

871
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,710
What parents are looking for is a good,

872
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:58,330
good guidance in school and good teachers
and safety that's still looking for

873
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:58,460
that.

874
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:03,190
I'm not necessarily sure that they're
looking for these ra fid chips because you

875
00:47:03,191 --> 00:47:05,990
know those things are kind of sketchy.
Those chips,

876
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:09,380
you can get information from them and
that's one of the reasons why they never

877
00:47:09,381 --> 00:47:11,720
did an episode on mythbusters spout it,
you know,

878
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:15,810
I said that it's one that was the one
episode where mythbusters was told they're

879
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,360
not going to cover that issue.

880
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,870
Yeah. So many, so many companies use
RFID. The technology is everywhere.

881
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,620
Well, the technology is not
secure. It can be tapping

882
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,000
of them. Yeah, you can
easily hack, but you know,

883
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,250
you were saying earlier about the people

884
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,250
in the government, how they've been around
for a long time. It's not even that.

885
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,760
I mean all these people like
Kissinger, even Madeline, all right,

886
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:38,680
all these corporate heads,
defense contractors,

887
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:41,530
they all sit on boards of these
think tanks that right our bills now,

888
00:47:41,531 --> 00:47:43,210
like no one fucking
right to bills anymore.

889
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:48,040
No Congress or the Senate passed too fast.
We've actually written,

890
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,700
one was changed in eight hours.
It was like changed overnight.

891
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,800
That was way more draconian and then
everyone just voted for it because they

892
00:47:54,801 --> 00:47:57,460
were in the fucking post nine 11
fervor and they're like, yeah dude,

893
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:01,330
we don't want to be unpatriotic.
It's amazing how gangster it was,

894
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,230
how they just ran in and immediately
started doing shit like that.

895
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:09,760
But it really,
it's such fueled

896
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,940
the, the deep end
conspiracy dudes, you know,

897
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:14,910
we're obviously talking
and conspiracy here.

898
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:20,540
There's someone for sure is conspiring
to control the government and there they

899
00:48:21,141 --> 00:48:24,140
don't want it to just strictly be the
will of the people. That's pretty clear.

900
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:24,771
And the,

901
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:28,220
the idea that we're going to do these
things in other countries and the other,

902
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:30,650
we're going to do it for, you
know, national defense reasons.

903
00:48:30,651 --> 00:48:33,720
Those also seem to be, it seems,
it seems pretty obvious. Tom's,

904
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,750
anybody's paying attention to,
that's not really the case.

905
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,820
So how long can you do that?
How long can you run a game like that?

906
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,520
How long do you think that
they can keep doing that?

907
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:48,250
It's melted down in Europe as we speak.
Uh, you're seeing the people there,

908
00:48:48,251 --> 00:48:50,770
they're unhappy about slightly
different things. Mostly economic,

909
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:51,650
but it seems like here,

910
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:54,910
no matter how many rights you take away
and how obvious in your face it is,

911
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:58,660
most people just go along with it.
Yeah. And until they feel it, I mean,

912
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,610
right now you can keep people at bay until
they're fucking feeling it. You know,

913
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,470
who says like making us more pro,

914
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,270
like the people more prosperous
is a benefit to them anyway.

915
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:10,630
Like sometimes maybe it's more
beneficial for our economy

916
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,750
collapse.
Yeah.

917
00:49:11,751 --> 00:49:15,500
But a lot of people have to agree with
the way things are going in order to keep

918
00:49:15,501 --> 00:49:16,580
something like this going on.

919
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,750
I mean at somewhere along the
line in the chain of command,

920
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:24,260
there has to be people that
are questioning the direction
that this is all going.

921
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,780
Cause I don't believe that everybody that
gets involved with government is evil.

922
00:49:26,781 --> 00:49:27,650
I think that's crazy.

923
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,650
I think a lot of people that get involved
in government are good people and they

924
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:31,760
want to actually help.

925
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:36,140
I think once they get in there and they
see that fucking Barb wire quagmire that

926
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:39,270
it is just a fucking,
just a massive corruption.

927
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:42,830
And I think then, you know,
get becomes distant heartening.

928
00:49:42,831 --> 00:49:46,760
And oftentimes in life you kind of
change what you stand for or change what

929
00:49:46,761 --> 00:49:49,340
you're there for and just sort of
settle into the groove. You know,

930
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,190
maybe you buy a boat,
you know,

931
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,750
and you got to pay your boat so
you keep your fucking mouth shot.

932
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,820
Well it's like these people at the
top half to see the collapse coming.

933
00:49:56,821 --> 00:49:59,070
They have to see that
global capitalism and,

934
00:49:59,071 --> 00:50:02,910
and kind of the predatory shit that we're
doing is not sustainable. I mean we're,

935
00:50:02,911 --> 00:50:05,460
we're focusing on a
model of endless growth.

936
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:08,970
I mean that that can't sustain itself.
So these people have to fucking see that.

937
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:13,460
Well they, they do and yet
they don't cause they do.
And yet they feel like, well,

938
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:16,070
we'll just adjust along the way
and keep this pitch. Roland,

939
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:20,270
it's not that you can ride the car forever
without changing the tires. It's like,

940
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,830
no, no, no, no, no. You're
going to get some flats.

941
00:50:21,831 --> 00:50:24,290
He changed the tire and you're
back on and you keep running.

942
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,220
And I think that's the
attitude that's going on there.

943
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,180
It's like until the last
drop oil in the ground,

944
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:32,810
then we can go over to alternative versus
sustainable energy and then we'll deal

945
00:50:32,811 --> 00:50:35,540
with it. Well, they, I assume
they probably figured out,

946
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,690
they think that someone's going to
come up with some effective form of

947
00:50:38,691 --> 00:50:41,720
propulsion based on water or you know,
there's,

948
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:44,630
I mean there's been people that have
made cars that have run on water.

949
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,690
I mean that's already existed and
converts to hydrogen. You know,

950
00:50:47,691 --> 00:50:50,150
it's complicated. But so it was
making a gasoline engine, you know,

951
00:50:50,151 --> 00:50:54,080
it's just a gasoline engines had been
made for thousands of years or hundreds of

952
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,370
years. Has it even been a hundred years.
My dating sucks weird that we don't have

953
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:03,330
Margaret Priority put on, uh, creating
the next like energy innovation.

954
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,730
I know that companies are spending
a lot of money to develop that,

955
00:51:05,731 --> 00:51:09,450
but you look at individuals, I don't
know a single person who's like, it's,

956
00:51:09,451 --> 00:51:09,701
I don't know,

957
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:13,290
a single ambitious person who wants
to develop the replacement to oil,

958
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,380
but I know a lot of people who want to
develop the next a hundred million dollar

959
00:51:16,381 --> 00:51:17,214
Facebook APP.

960
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:21,020
You were kind of, we think
the oil issue is, uh,

961
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:26,120
is really tricky because there's
debatable science that shows that oil,

962
00:51:27,031 --> 00:51:30,270
uh, grows back in some areas,
you know, and if it does,

963
00:51:30,271 --> 00:51:34,650
it takes a long time and no one's
telling us how much is actually left.

964
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,060
There's like real,

965
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,510
it's a real questionable information
when it comes to how much of a supply has

966
00:51:39,511 --> 00:51:41,760
left.
The real question is though,

967
00:51:41,761 --> 00:51:46,761
do you just suck it all out full blast
until it runs dry and when it runs dry we

968
00:51:47,701 --> 00:51:49,770
will see fucking havoc?

969
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:53,490
Or is this communicated
to the powers that be,

970
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,710
is there any sort of preparation
put in place with, you know,

971
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:58,980
a harnessing resources,
getting universities involved,

972
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,790
bringing in scientific guys and saying,
look, we've got to fucking do something.

973
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:06,630
We had to do it now either we have to
figure out some sort of solar power trains

974
00:52:06,631 --> 00:52:09,810
that are gonna take everybody around you.
We're going to have to do something.

975
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,480
Well, he was saying that like this
morning we were taught, we were taught,

976
00:52:12,481 --> 00:52:15,210
we had this almost exact same conversation
last night and he was talking about

977
00:52:15,211 --> 00:52:16,044
how,
um,

978
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:20,700
some of like the economic control is so
intertwined with our need for oil that

979
00:52:20,701 --> 00:52:23,280
it's difficult at this point
to just transition over.

980
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:28,281
Like the people that have control
over the way our economy fluctuates.

981
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:33,470
Um, whatever control they can have, the
dollar would be garbage. Yeah. Without,

982
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,050
it's linked to oil. Right. But we're not
based on gold anymore. We're based on oil,

983
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,520
but it felt Boyle is a
finite resource if it,

984
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:43,930
but if it only has 30 years of full,
full boat, I mean 30 years at this rate,

985
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:44,860
which by the way,

986
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:49,240
even though the oil is
consumed less by cars today,

987
00:52:49,241 --> 00:52:52,090
there's more cars today. So even though
they get better miles to the gallon,

988
00:52:52,091 --> 00:52:55,300
there's more of them and it takes oil to
make these fucking things and it's like

989
00:52:55,301 --> 00:52:56,410
we're never going to stop making cars.

990
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:59,410
People are gonna always want a new car
and people were always going to try to

991
00:52:59,411 --> 00:53:03,670
afford a car and they're going to get a
car and then at a certain point in time

992
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:08,470
you're going to run out. And if
they just run out, if it just would,

993
00:53:08,471 --> 00:53:12,880
would they be wise enough to like
have any preparation in place?

994
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,960
You would fucking hope. So that's
the, that's the real question.

995
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:20,140
It's like when you see shit like the
Patriot Act being passed and then you see

996
00:53:20,141 --> 00:53:23,880
the Nda being passed, you see
these, this crunched down lately,

997
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:25,980
you see all this buildup in the military.
They

998
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,260
should be, that's their idea of the
preparation. That's what I'm saying.

999
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,490
That's what I'm worried.
What I'm saying is when I'm looking at it,

1000
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,370
I'm looking at, if you look at the
possibility that oil is a finite resource,

1001
00:53:35,371 --> 00:53:37,890
that's what they say.
I'm too dumb to understand it.

1002
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:39,510
I don't know who's right or who's wrong.

1003
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:42,930
There's a book called black
gold stranglehold where
some guy tries to claim that

1004
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,830
the oil oil is actually made.
It's a process of the earth.

1005
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,190
I mean it's, it's some
sort of fossil fuel, right?

1006
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:52,140
It's something that's
created by the earth,

1007
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:55,830
but it takes like millions of
millions and pressed carbon mattered.

1008
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,560
Millions magic. How
much is there? You know,

1009
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,430
I mean they're talking about going into
Alaska and pulling it out and apparently

1010
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:05,240
it's like super difficult to do that
cause it's a different kind of oil, right?

1011
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:09,180
Like shale oil. It's oil, it's in rock.
It's in the oil company's interest to do,

1012
00:54:09,181 --> 00:54:12,000
uh, to exaggerate their
holdings. Like, Oh yeah, this,

1013
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:15,150
this plot right here has 100 billion,
whatever.

1014
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:18,030
I'll use barrels beneath the
soil or beneath the ground.

1015
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:21,270
Who knows if it actually does, cause
it's your own proprietary calculation.

1016
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,980
How do they calculate it? I have
no idea, but if you look up,

1017
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:26,400
you think about it like which
sounds better to share holders.

1018
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:27,390
We might have a billion,

1019
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,380
a billion barrels or we have 100 billion
barrels and who's going to challenge

1020
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:31,740
that?
There's,

1021
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,310
I don't know of any like did that
would be dependent analysis group.

1022
00:54:35,311 --> 00:54:37,590
It does that confusing as fuck do you,

1023
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:42,120
could you imagine the day the oil runs
out you want to talk about a horrific

1024
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:46,620
symbiotic connection that we have.
We have like as a side,

1025
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:49,890
the only way you can make this
work at all is if you have oil,

1026
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:55,040
the jets that fly people
across the country for Fedex
envelopes and anything you

1027
00:54:55,141 --> 00:54:58,200
want to get done over night and everything
that you have that's made out of

1028
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:00,670
plastic.
Almost all of that shit.

1029
00:55:00,671 --> 00:55:04,080
It comes from oil and if we really are
going to pull that stuff out of the

1030
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:08,370
ground like that and we really are just
going to get it full blast until the

1031
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:11,280
wheels fall off.
That could be what they're preparing for.

1032
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,700
If they know that there's only a
few years less to the left of this,

1033
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,960
that could be what they're preparing
for and that's a terrifying idea.

1034
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:21,750
It's a terrifying idea because I
don't know what the alternative is.

1035
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:25,830
If I was in charge and I knew that the
fucking wheels are going to fall off and

1036
00:55:25,831 --> 00:55:28,770
there was nothing we could do and people
are going to starve and go fucking fond,

1037
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:31,080
Zombie in the street is
going to be no more oil.

1038
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,430
I don't know what I would do either.
I don't know what I would do. Yeah.

1039
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,430
These people are really not looking past
their bottom line every year after year.

1040
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,430
I mean they have to be seen.

1041
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,440
How many people would know if there
was only 20 years left of oil,

1042
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:46,410
how many people would know? I mean, how
many people would really be aware of that?

1043
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,910
It is pretty common knowledge
that we have. I mean,

1044
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:53,940
oil is not,
oil is not a fucking infinite.

1045
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:57,450
I mean that we'll know by the price
like as soon as it became more rare,

1046
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,960
but they can, they can totally
bullshit that to you. Right.

1047
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,420
How will you know how much oil they
really have and why would they tell you?

1048
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,930
I mean,
I would think that if they,

1049
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:10,860
if they did tell you it would be worse
because then people would go crazy. Now,

1050
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,540
you know,
the inevitable would happen.

1051
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:15,390
Now it's easier for them to do
that because the price of oil now,

1052
00:56:15,391 --> 00:56:18,660
like the way it's speculated
on like it's way over priced.

1053
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:21,570
So they could actually,
as it becomes more expensive for them,

1054
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:24,310
they can hold it at that
price for quite a while before

1055
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:26,350
they end up having a short,
I mean it would just,

1056
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:30,360
their profits would go down a little bit.
But what he's talking about oil, well,

1057
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,650
what I mean is like as
we go less and less oil,

1058
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:35,800
like they've speculated the price
of oil, it's a lot higher. You know,

1059
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:39,940
it'd be like $100 dollars a barrel when
it's really only like 60 so even if they

1060
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:40,960
started to run out,

1061
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:44,500
they can maintain the illusion
that it's holding it $100 a barrel

1062
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,020
for so, and we wouldn't know until
it was almost too late. Well,

1063
00:56:48,021 --> 00:56:51,740
it'd be too late anyway because they told
you that we have 10 years left of oil.

1064
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,290
You have 10 years left or then then
it's over. It's too late already. Yeah,

1065
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:58,850
because 10 years, 10 years tops, not
enough time, none of bio. By the way,

1066
00:56:58,851 --> 00:57:02,750
people are going to go straight crazy.
If you pick people,

1067
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,840
if people found out that there's 10
years left to the oil right away,

1068
00:57:05,841 --> 00:57:07,790
people would fucking
start committing suicide.

1069
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,770
They wouldn't be able to deal
with it and we'll go crazy

1070
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,630
taking the oil out of the ground
and look what it does at Damn.

1071
00:57:12,631 --> 00:57:16,700
It just destroys everything and we have
sustainable alternative resources that

1072
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:19,370
we can start investing it.
I mean, there are options.

1073
00:57:19,371 --> 00:57:21,650
It's not like we're looking at me
like what the fuck are we going to do?

1074
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,410
We don't hold on.

1075
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,930
Well, you got to not talk over
each other a little bit. Oh, sorry.

1076
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:28,140
The podcast things a little bit different
than a regular conversation and it

1077
00:57:28,141 --> 00:57:31,030
seems normal, but when we're
both doing that at the same time,

1078
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:33,480
it's going to be a problem.
People fall off ellipticals that way.

1079
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:40,640
They go down that way. Um, what were you
saying? Uh, I don't remember. Oh, sorry.

1080
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:43,650
Um, it's, I don't know.

1081
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,910
[inaudible] our whole scene in this
country is very confusing, but that's not,

1082
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,720
not in the, uh, not the
most confusing aspect of it.

1083
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,520
The global warming aspect
is terrifying to have.

1084
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:56,280
How many people want to
put their head in the sand?

1085
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:59,370
That there's not something going on
with the climate that could potentially

1086
00:57:59,371 --> 00:58:02,600
damage everything? There's this weird
conservative thing where they go,

1087
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:06,030
I like a guy in my Jujitsu
class the other day.

1088
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,400
This guy is marine guy.
He's a nice guy,

1089
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,300
but he's like one of those fucking gung
dude's and someone is talking about

1090
00:58:12,301 --> 00:58:13,050
global warming,

1091
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,710
about watching something and he's like
global warming's a natural process.

1092
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,390
And I go, what are you a fucking scientist
or something? So it was a tornado.

1093
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,850
The can't get a good thing, but how do you
know? How do you, how does anybody know?

1094
00:58:23,851 --> 00:58:26,760
I mean, how the fuck could
anybody be a 26 year old guy?

1095
00:58:26,761 --> 00:58:29,760
Especially be so confident that you,
you can say,

1096
00:58:29,761 --> 00:58:32,100
you know what changes the
fucking temperature of the earth.

1097
00:58:32,101 --> 00:58:35,610
Which by the way changes radically
over a period of a thousand years.

1098
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,130
Cause the point where there's places
where you used to be able to live and

1099
00:58:38,131 --> 00:58:41,370
nothing can live in them
now like Antarctica at one
point in time was nice and

1100
00:58:41,371 --> 00:58:44,640
juicy and green and had rivers
and stuff. Yeah. Not Anymore.

1101
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:48,540
An asteroid is a natural process.
Awesome. Fuck yeah. I mean, so if, if,

1102
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,170
even if it's naturally cause,

1103
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:53,220
which I don't really believe for whatever
reason the earth is getting hotter and

1104
00:58:53,221 --> 00:58:55,260
colder, it's getting more extreme. So we,

1105
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,000
you just start thinking
about how do we fix that?

1106
00:58:57,030 --> 00:59:00,750
Do we put shit up in the sky to it is
natural. It is natural. I mean the,

1107
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:04,680
the natural d poisoning of the environment
is a byproduct of the human being.

1108
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,830
And it's also cows.
Cows fucking global,

1109
00:59:07,831 --> 00:59:11,790
warm that shit up at places with
their dirty farts. Delicious.

1110
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:15,560
You love all the burden's on us.
Like calculate your carbon footprint guys.

1111
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:15,831
And you're like,

1112
00:59:15,831 --> 00:59:18,830
what are you gonna fucking do about the
methane gas that you're admitting from

1113
00:59:18,831 --> 00:59:21,990
all of these slaughterhouses? I mean,
that's like 20 of all the initial

1114
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:25,520
notes right there. Or just consumer
of the largest polluting the world.

1115
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,090
My folks used to live in Pennsylvania
when I used to drive to visit them.

1116
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:33,710
I had to go through an hour and
a half of this horrific smell.

1117
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,220
And it was these farms in Ohio,
the whole state of Ohio. Ooh,

1118
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:43,040
it's so bad. It's like coming in the
events of the car. Terrific. It's just,

1119
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,530
it's shit and dead animals.
That's what you're smelling.

1120
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,390
You smelling shit and rot. Yeah. Farts.

1121
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:52,100
Climate change is somehow a partisan
issue. Like how did that happen?

1122
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,640
Like I don't understand why it's
a conservative talking point.

1123
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:58,460
If you listen to conservative
radio, they're constantly
mock liberals, liberals,

1124
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:03,200
these lives, these lives in their global
warming fee. It's unnatural process.

1125
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:08,260
There's data or scientific and they have
this sort of no nonsense way about you

1126
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:11,390
that makes you,
it's a very aggressive ideology.

1127
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,130
So it makes you want to be on their side,
you know?

1128
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:18,110
So it's sort of bullies you in a gold
egg. It's a globe. It's a normal process.

1129
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,420
Meanwhile you don't even know what the
fuck you're talking about. Like a guy.

1130
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:23,630
This guy interjected into this other
people's conversation. I was involved,

1131
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:25,620
I was sitting on the sidelines
and he just, he just,

1132
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,030
he walked up and they were talking and
he just interjected this conservative

1133
01:00:29,031 --> 01:00:32,020
talking point. It's like that's it's
fastened. Dropped it. He's like boom,

1134
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,820
I'm out.
Cause they do it.

1135
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,990
Like David's whole point is like who
cares if it's a natural process or not?

1136
01:00:38,991 --> 01:00:41,450
Like shouldn't we be doing
something about it? Most certainly.

1137
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,660
But it is a natural process because
people are cons. There's a good,

1138
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,620
there's a good graphic.

1139
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:48,350
Every time I fucking see somebody throw
a cigarette out the window, I'm like,

1140
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:51,830
why is that so easy for you to do?
Why is it so easy for you to just,

1141
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:56,540
let's just make shit worse. Why is it so
easy? Right? Because we have a disconnect.

1142
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,010
Human beings or there's something
missing in the way the human society is

1143
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:04,040
currently run because it's all about the
end, the line. It's all about getting,

1144
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:07,970
getting some awesome property,
you know, gathering up your toys,

1145
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:10,980
living a good life, putting your kids
in a good school. That's like the, the,

1146
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:14,210
the bottom end line.
And along the way there's,

1147
01:01:14,211 --> 01:01:16,640
there's so little emphasis
on enjoying the moment.

1148
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:21,340
There's so little emphasis on what
you could actually be doing it,

1149
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:22,580
how you could be feeling,

1150
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:26,930
how you could be enjoying this life and
how it is finite and it really doesn't

1151
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,960
mean you have to fuck find
out and concentrate on what
makes you happy and how

1152
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,260
many people get to do that.

1153
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:37,970
This is a small fraction of the people
that are traveling with us on the

1154
01:01:37,971 --> 01:01:41,330
highways and driving with
us on the streets and that
you run into every day that

1155
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:43,430
are actually happy
people. It's a tiny, tiny,

1156
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:47,300
tiny number because they're tricked
into this country shitty world.

1157
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,650
There's tricky fucking goofy world where
there's a thing called the federal bank

1158
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:56,780
that's not really federal and it has
control over all the money and it's not

1159
01:01:56,781 --> 01:02:00,170
based on anything. And the money's
not really based on anything anymore.

1160
01:02:00,171 --> 01:02:02,990
It used to be based on gold,
but now it's just kind of confidence.

1161
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:08,150
Like you grow up with this shitty
fucking system and it's so disheartening.

1162
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:13,100
It's so hard for people that have to pay
taxes to this system and have to spend

1163
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:17,210
into this system. It's so hard for them
to just keep doing it and be happy.

1164
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:17,810
You know?

1165
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:22,560
Even if you have a good job that you
enjoy and you can't afford to live where

1166
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:25,560
you live because you have to pay
too much taxes. That's maddening.

1167
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,180
That drives people crazy.

1168
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,760
Like you can't live in a nice neighborhood
and you have to live in a little bit

1169
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:32,640
of a Shitty your neighborhood because
you've got to pay 40% of the government.

1170
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:36,840
Can you imagine if, if society rewarded
you for creation instead of like,

1171
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:37,790
I mean all the, like the, the,

1172
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:41,820
the smartest people in this country
are working to for destruction. I mean,

1173
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:44,850
how did like build bombs and kill people?
It's like,

1174
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:48,270
what if we rewarded rewarded
people and creativity?

1175
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:51,830
How to scam you with ads on
Facebook, all that. Yeah,

1176
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,530
the Predator drone or scam you
out of money. It's amazing.

1177
01:02:55,531 --> 01:02:59,550
We're just stunting our potential so much
for human growth and our consciousness.

1178
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,170
We're on the cusp of greatness and there's
just a couple of psychopaths sort of

1179
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:05,460
like cock blocking us,

1180
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,070
Paul. It's a, there's a whole
culture of the uninvolved unevolved.

1181
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:16,020
There's a a culture of people that still
have this fucking buck Rogers view of

1182
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:20,280
the world. It's not, it's not a
small amount. It's a lot of people.

1183
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:22,980
It's people that haven't had
any psychedelic experiences.

1184
01:03:22,981 --> 01:03:26,910
It's people that are from really dumb
environments than the in they're, they're,

1185
01:03:26,911 --> 01:03:30,570
they're prone to imitating
their atmosphere and the
atmosphere is filled with

1186
01:03:30,571 --> 01:03:34,680
idiots and it's not a small number. It's
a big number. Unfortunately, this more,

1187
01:03:34,681 --> 01:03:38,790
almost 50% of this country believes that
the earth is less than 10,000 years old

1188
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:41,760
based on scripture.
Almost 50% of the country.

1189
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:45,850
That's more than a hundred million people.
That's craziness. Let's sad it has in.

1190
01:03:45,851 --> 01:03:49,590
It isn't. It's fascinating and it's,
it, it's, it's, it's weird. You know,

1191
01:03:49,591 --> 01:03:54,030
it's like if you see those videos of
people like that go to these strange rain

1192
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:56,880
forests and they, they find this
tribe that's never seen people before,

1193
01:03:56,881 --> 01:04:00,630
they catch it on camera, cause some
fucking weirdness to it, right?

1194
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,930
When you see like, wow, you
know, these poor people, they're,

1195
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:06,510
they're living in here with leaves on
our dicks and jumping from tree to tree

1196
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:07,850
and then you look at

1197
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:09,320
la.
Yeah.

1198
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:12,880
You look at, you look at our
society, you look at our,

1199
01:04:12,881 --> 01:04:15,340
our craziness and you
somewhere along the line,

1200
01:04:15,341 --> 01:04:18,880
I think everybody has to conclude that
no one really is in control of this

1201
01:04:18,881 --> 01:04:19,714
fucking thing.

1202
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,230
It runs on momentum and whether
it's good momentum or bad momentum,

1203
01:04:23,231 --> 01:04:24,340
it runs on momentum.

1204
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,770
That's really important when you're
looking at the, looking at the election,

1205
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,450
you see like the bullshit.
It propagates because of momentum.

1206
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:36,990
Some people who are really anti Romney,

1207
01:04:36,991 --> 01:04:40,320
you're trying to push this sense
Sada story, however it's pronounced.

1208
01:04:40,321 --> 01:04:43,290
It's his company that he used to
invest in that outsource American jobs.

1209
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:44,250
The Chinese workers.

1210
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,800
I think that's like that's like
the cliff notes version and uh,

1211
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,120
they're trying to make this a huge issue
so they're just like blowing up Twitter

1212
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:55,560
feeds with it and asking journalists
to cover it and the facts are that it's

1213
01:04:55,561 --> 01:04:56,820
really not that big an issue.

1214
01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:00,090
I'm not saying this is some kind of like
Republican shill. I'm an independent,

1215
01:05:00,091 --> 01:05:02,010
it's just like it's clearly
not a big fucking issue.

1216
01:05:02,011 --> 01:05:05,430
He used to invest a small amount of money
in this company and like it'd be like

1217
01:05:05,431 --> 01:05:08,790
if I own shares of Microsoft five years
ago and then you came up to me and

1218
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:11,580
you're like, dude, the Zune
sucks. Why do I care about that?

1219
01:05:11,581 --> 01:05:14,970
I don't own any shares of this company.
And like if I did it was a small share.

1220
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:17,980
And how is that the most important
thing happening now when you

1221
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,230
should be going after maybe
like some of his beliefs,

1222
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,730
sort of his beliefs on the war,

1223
01:05:21,731 --> 01:05:24,970
on drugs continuing that is belief
something we need to increase our defense

1224
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:25,540
budget.

1225
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,360
I think those are more important issues
than some fucking obscure company that

1226
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:31,660
he might have invested in a while ago.
It's weird that Mormons,

1227
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,120
generally speaking,
I like super nice guys.

1228
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:37,360
Like I've met a lot of Mormons and one
of the things about them is they're like

1229
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:42,130
almost like to a man changeovers friendly,
gentle,

1230
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:46,720
gentle lovers.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1231
01:05:46,721 --> 01:05:49,600
Like they seem to be like sort of a
peaceful religion. Very nice. But it's,

1232
01:05:49,601 --> 01:05:52,240
I think it's hostile to think that you
have to convert other people to your

1233
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:56,320
belief system. Well, it's nice to be
like in a tie and be friendly to people,

1234
01:05:56,321 --> 01:05:59,260
but if your underlying thing is these
people are idiots because they don't

1235
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:03,250
believe what I believe. Well it's
a cult. I mean, don't get me wrong,

1236
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:07,420
I'm just saying it's a cult that
makes nice people. If the outcomes,

1237
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:12,730
it's a cult and, and, and, and even if
you know you, you want to diverge from,

1238
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:15,700
you know, that you want to say all
religions are called, well maybe,

1239
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:19,600
but here's when they're clearly calls.
When you know the guy who wrote it. Yeah.

1240
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,380
It's like 50 years ago.

1241
01:06:23,381 --> 01:06:27,370
His fucking name is Joseph Smith
in 1820 really liked women.

1242
01:06:27,371 --> 01:06:29,530
So that's why you get the multiple wives.
That's by the way,

1243
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:31,300
why Mitt Romney's families from Mexico,

1244
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:35,500
Mitt Romney's family comes from I
fucking religious compound in Mexico.

1245
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:38,620
They separated from the United States
because they wanted to fuck more bitches.

1246
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:42,820
That shows leadership leadership,
having your own compound in Mexico.

1247
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:45,790
That's dope as fuck, dude. I just
moved there because he want 20 wives.

1248
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:49,240
They were like, you can't have 20
wives. He was like, oh bitch, I can,

1249
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:52,270
I'll just got to go here.
And when they did it too,

1250
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:55,060
it was in the 18 hundreds and you know,
there was no cars yet.

1251
01:06:55,061 --> 01:06:57,160
So America wasn't quite
as awesome as it is now.

1252
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,710
There wasn't really that much of a
difference between living in Mexico and

1253
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:03,070
living in Texas. You know, he just
went over there, okay, now I can do it.

1254
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:06,460
Let's just buy some land here. It's cheap.
We'll fucking make a bad ass compound.

1255
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,090
They outsource themselves. So that's
why midst dad could never be president.

1256
01:07:10,091 --> 01:07:14,340
And His dad wanted to be president, but
he was born in Mexico. Shazamm sorry.

1257
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,000
Isn't that crazy?
He mean he's a full on nutter.

1258
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,010
I mean he's not just from a cult.

1259
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:25,870
He's from the branch that left the
country because they wanted to continue

1260
01:07:25,871 --> 01:07:28,900
their, their multiple wife practice.
You can have multiple wives,

1261
01:07:28,901 --> 01:07:32,650
but you can't marry a gay person. That's
bad. God doesn't want it. I'm old.

1262
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:36,040
Marriage is next.
Medical marijuana don't believe in it.

1263
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:37,600
I believe I'm just turned up.

1264
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:41,020
Can I play devil's advocate
on the door on me since he,

1265
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:43,630
since we actually have a record of
what he did when he was governor of

1266
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:47,770
Massachusetts, we see that he
did not try to, for example, uh,

1267
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:50,650
in prison or execute women who
use like the morning after pill.

1268
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,300
He said that he didn't do
this shit. You know, like,

1269
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:56,250
so like some of the fantasies coming
from certain elements of the left. Uh,

1270
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,880
and I hate to use terms
like the left and the right,

1271
01:07:57,881 --> 01:08:00,220
cause I'm totally against that stuff.
But these fantasies,

1272
01:08:00,221 --> 01:08:02,710
it's like he was governor,
he was a powerful guy. He
didn't do any of that shit.

1273
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:03,670
He was fairly moderate.

1274
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,940
You can attack him for being
a kind of a heartless person,

1275
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:10,990
but he is not nearly as extreme
as I think, as people think.

1276
01:08:10,991 --> 01:08:13,120
And as he's portraying himself to be.
Well,

1277
01:08:13,121 --> 01:08:16,190
I think he's very flexible
and I think he's, it's what's

1278
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:20,090
really important for guys like Mitt Romney
has to be in power and Massachusetts

1279
01:08:20,091 --> 01:08:22,100
is a very liberal state.
I grew up in Massachusetts.

1280
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:26,300
You can't get by on just total
strict Republican, you know,

1281
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:28,130
rhetoric in Massachusetts,
it's not going to work.

1282
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,730
So he sort of went with the flow
of the thing. That's what I think.

1283
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:33,140
And I think he's a,

1284
01:08:33,141 --> 01:08:36,740
that's the most dangerous thing about
him is that he doesn't seem to have like

1285
01:08:36,741 --> 01:08:41,160
real strong opinions on things. I mean,
he seems to know how to make money with,

1286
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:44,330
you know, I don't understand
what they do. I mean,

1287
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:48,890
I've tried to look into like what's
supposed to be so evil about Bain capital,

1288
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:52,670
but it's, to me it's, it's numbers
nonsense. It's all craziness.

1289
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,190
I read the Matt Taibbi
article in Rolling Stone,

1290
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:59,780
which is a another mind fucking
sort of a view where you're like,

1291
01:08:59,781 --> 01:09:02,420
why do you make money doing watts?
Like I need to do it.

1292
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:05,540
And then they move it from here
and then they give them loans.

1293
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:07,570
He never pay it back and like walked off.

1294
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:11,340
Fuck Mitt Romney said he harvests
business businesses for profit.

1295
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:13,770
Sounds like ma the matrix
and harvesting human being.

1296
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,850
But do you know the bank capital?

1297
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,880
Bain capital is actually integral
into a pushing Monsanto into biotech.

1298
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:22,140
So Bain capital.
Yeah,

1299
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:27,380
Mitt Romney got $1 million from the ex
CEO of Monsanto when he was starting off

1300
01:09:27,451 --> 01:09:31,080
at Bain capital and he got pushed into,
you know,

1301
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,960
he's very tight with Monsanto.
So as Obama they all are,

1302
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:36,920
it's so creepy when you find that
the history of Monsanto, you know,

1303
01:09:36,921 --> 01:09:39,650
everybody thinks about, Oh man, these
genetically modified foods are dangerous.

1304
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:43,820
How about AZT? How about
fucking, how about Agent Orange?

1305
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,840
The chemo with Agent Orange,

1306
01:09:45,841 --> 01:09:49,380
that company making your DHT
grains that are in your cereal.

1307
01:09:49,381 --> 01:09:53,220
It's crazy to his cancer
medication. Ddt and DDT, they made

1308
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:57,600
Agent Orange and here they
are making a call on hollow.

1309
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:59,060
How's about how a lot of player,

1310
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:03,330
I fucking poison the shadow Alyse then
Alabama for like decades and knew about

1311
01:10:03,331 --> 01:10:06,280
it and everyone's like dying and they're
like, oh yeah, our bad. Sorry about that.

1312
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,410
Was it with the use PCBs just dumping
the shit in the water and everyone's like

1313
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:14,490
retarded now. Whoa. Why would they dump
it in the water? Just because they could,

1314
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:19,020
they had it and it was there and
that's how they got rid of it. Wow.

1315
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,490
Zero regulation.

1316
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:24,320
It's a, the, the Indian farmer things,
the scariest thing when you feel God,

1317
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:28,530
hundreds of thousands of Indian farmers
have committed suicide is does it,

1318
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:28,970
how would,

1319
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:33,970
how are they connected to Monsanto by
choice or is it like they have no choice

1320
01:10:34,111 --> 01:10:35,010
where to buy their seeds?

1321
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,530
Um, they are, yeah,
they're being forced. Well,

1322
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,460
one of our main thing and the government
is forcing Monsanto seeds on them and

1323
01:10:41,461 --> 01:10:43,260
so they're burning them
and people are just like,

1324
01:10:43,261 --> 01:10:45,630
why would poor people burn food?
And you're like,

1325
01:10:45,631 --> 01:10:50,631
because they'd get it like they don't
mean it's crazy like owning non-regulated

1326
01:10:50,821 --> 01:10:52,590
seeds or something like that.
Like if you,

1327
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:54,550
you have to get your
seeds from a certain way,

1328
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:58,140
the most sinister shit out there and
also creates mono cropping and destroys

1329
01:10:58,141 --> 01:11:00,330
local agriculture.
If there is a god,

1330
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,340
a seed is clearly designed to be something
that should not be regulated or bad

1331
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:08,230
cause it drops through the fucking tree.
You know, like it creates more of an eat.

1332
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,660
Some of them,
it creates more of them.

1333
01:11:09,661 --> 01:11:14,040
Like it's not something that's
supposed to be a Somby competitive

1334
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,060
products. We're making Zombie plants
that can't make babies, you know,

1335
01:11:18,061 --> 01:11:20,580
so you have to keep buying
seats from these fucking, this,

1336
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:24,420
this evil group of people that's planning,
grading super worms and shit though.

1337
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:26,970
So it's like not even going
to work anymore and that's
what's going to be really

1338
01:11:26,971 --> 01:11:30,580
scary about it. The idea of, of doing
it for profit too. It's just so,

1339
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,090
it's so crazy how much
money can make doing that.

1340
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,740
And they're getting away with it.

1341
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:38,730
And now they see the study that shows
his tumors that are some rats that are

1342
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:43,290
eating genetically modified corn. Creepy.
Well, you know, it's not an actual food.

1343
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:47,190
There's, there's a, there's a crazy
battle going on. Ladies and gentlemen.

1344
01:11:47,191 --> 01:11:51,120
This is just one of the rats
get cancer from like everything,

1345
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:53,820
those fucking losers.
But what about the terminates or alluded?

1346
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,640
That's a weapon on down made a
terminator seed that destroys it.

1347
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:01,800
So after one year, no, it's swear to God,
it's, it destroys itself after one yield.

1348
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,630
You're like,
why would you even have to make that?

1349
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,630
What are you going to use
that for such a your seeds?

1350
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:10,430
So that's just the fuck over. Barch a
god thing. It's such a claim. I mean,

1351
01:12:10,431 --> 01:12:13,080
you're playing God, you're,
you're actually fucking with life.

1352
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:17,280
And because it's a plant, we were like,
ah, it's just a plant. It's still life.

1353
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:19,770
That's a living organism
and you fucked with it.

1354
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:22,980
And now you're growing your own organism.
And then you wrote,

1355
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,720
you wrote that you own this organism. I
mean, Jesus Christ, you own it. I mean,

1356
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:30,480
it's like a dog. Like you know,
this is your shit. You know,

1357
01:12:30,481 --> 01:12:35,310
you've made little robot
seeds, the you, you now,

1358
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,600
you now you own all these,

1359
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:38,880
you seldom these people and they can
never use them again and they can't,

1360
01:12:38,881 --> 01:12:42,330
they don't grow.
So the whole idea behind it is insanity.

1361
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:45,570
It's insane that you could
be able to patent life

1362
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:52,040
where they actually outlaw collecting
rainwater too. So, you know,

1363
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:54,650
you get the idea that no one's protected,

1364
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:57,510
that no one's come in and
protected that and said, listen,

1365
01:12:57,511 --> 01:13:01,080
you cannot own life if you
can't patent life, you can't.

1366
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:04,530
You can't have the genetic code for
pigs. Yeah, you want another one?

1367
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:08,700
How about bottled water?
We were talking about this yesterday.

1368
01:13:08,701 --> 01:13:12,750
If you're to go back in time 30 years
and tell somebody, uh, 30 years from now,

1369
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:16,350
you're going to have to pay $2 50 cents
out of a machine for a bottle of water

1370
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,540
to hotel.
And on top of that,

1371
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:21,450
most of our wars are going to
be fought by robots in the sky.

1372
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,870
People at the venue are
like schizophrenia. That's
crazy. Shit. Water's free.

1373
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:27,810
Just go down to the daughters
told me that even years ago,

1374
01:13:27,811 --> 01:13:30,900
I probably wouldn't believe
you. The water, the issue is a,

1375
01:13:30,901 --> 01:13:33,960
is a tough one because you know, some
people say it's just drink, tap water.

1376
01:13:33,961 --> 01:13:36,780
It's safe. Like Penn and teller
had a whole show about it. But no,

1377
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:40,330
it's not really okay. Because there's
fluoride in it. And guess what flora?

1378
01:13:40,331 --> 01:13:44,130
It's poison. I mean it's a very low
level poison and the idea is that floor,

1379
01:13:44,131 --> 01:13:46,830
it's supposed to kill the bad things that
are on your teeth to give you cavities.

1380
01:13:46,831 --> 01:13:49,170
And that's,
I guess maybe that it does that,

1381
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:50,850
but you really could get away without it.

1382
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,800
You could brush your teeth
without using fluoride.

1383
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:56,100
Fluoride is fucking kind of dangerous.
It's not healthy for the body.

1384
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:59,850
And you know, you drink water
with fluoride in it all the time.

1385
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:03,210
There's been studies that show that
it could calcify your pineal gland,

1386
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:07,470
which is where Melatonin and DMT or
produced like that fluoride actually can

1387
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,320
fuck with the chemistry of your
brain if you take in a lot of,

1388
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:14,290
especially if you're drinking a lot of
tap water every day and you think about

1389
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:15,650
how much flora that there could have

1390
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,890
bathing thinking, I mean you're
already in consuming, I mean why,

1391
01:14:18,891 --> 01:14:21,220
why is it that we
accepted this propaganda?

1392
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:24,620
We still do that somehow the fluoridation
of water supplies all across the

1393
01:14:24,621 --> 01:14:27,740
country is good for us. I mean
it's mass medication. It's a,

1394
01:14:27,741 --> 01:14:29,690
it's a byproduct of phosphate mining.

1395
01:14:29,691 --> 01:14:33,110
They sell it to municipalities and
we drink it. I mean it's insane.

1396
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:34,240
Yeah,
and by the way,

1397
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:39,100
it was one of Hitler's ideas to fluoridate
the water to keep the population

1398
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:43,900
numb. Those Hitler's idea, like it
was much more fluoride I believe.

1399
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:46,390
Then we use now I think,
you know,

1400
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:50,620
ours is less and sinister and I think
they did it because someone tricked them

1401
01:14:50,621 --> 01:14:53,740
into doing it for, you know, the
idea of a dental hygiene. It's like,

1402
01:14:53,741 --> 01:14:57,160
we ha I had this Guy Dave Asprey on the
show yesterday and he was talking about

1403
01:14:57,161 --> 01:14:58,360
how bullshit,

1404
01:14:58,361 --> 01:15:02,860
how much bullshit is involved in the
idea of a salt of having a low salt diet

1405
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,210
and how crazy that is.

1406
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:08,260
And he was talking about how that's just
propaganda that stuck around like a no

1407
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:10,340
salt diet.
How's it supposed to have plenty of salt?

1408
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:13,300
My salt salt's in essential minerals.
This Guy Dave Asprey,

1409
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:16,480
carry salt around with them.
He brings salt with him everywhere.

1410
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,420
He goes like he has salt every morning.
He says it's like an essential,

1411
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:24,390
like part of being a human animal.
You need it to retain water. Yeah,

1412
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:27,130
everybody needs it. It's just one
of those things where you know,

1413
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:31,830
you get sold some wacky bill of
goods, you know, like, remember,

1414
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,930
do you ever remember those commercials
that they used to have where they had

1415
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:39,070
doctors suggesting particular types
of cigarettes? It was a crazy,

1416
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,810
it helps with digestion as your meal.
God.

1417
01:15:43,811 --> 01:15:46,630
Doctors are recommending where Shit
today in cigarettes. Well, do you, um,

1418
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:50,690
what was the movie? Oh, Jay Edgar. The
J Edgar Hoover. I thought that was good.

1419
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:51,940
It was good.
It was good.

1420
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:56,970
The Leonardo Dicaprio movie and in it
she says that the doctor prescribed him

1421
01:15:58,241 --> 01:16:01,570
cigarettes for his health,
like to make them more robust.

1422
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,310
There's a prescribed cigarettes,

1423
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,500
it was on mad men and there was actually
a movie that came out a few years ago

1424
01:16:06,501 --> 01:16:10,550
and like it was kind of post apocalyptic
and the people who lived there like

1425
01:16:10,551 --> 01:16:14,090
they would have to smoke cigarettes
cause it had medication in it and protect

1426
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:19,091
them from like the like I think I've
seen that that means they're just given

1427
01:16:20,091 --> 01:16:24,860
them wheat. Salem Wenson must've paid a
lot for, yeah, cigarettes are cast alive.

1428
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,420
You,
you said stuff about,

1429
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:28,610
it's like you didn't really like
it because it kind of sucked.

1430
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:32,480
I enjoy it as background. I put it on
when I write sometimes visually. Yeah.

1431
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:35,560
It's the length that I tweet it to
you about that. What about it? Uh,

1432
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,780
they created a fake corporate
website for Wayland,

1433
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:40,990
which is the company that
backs their mission. Right.

1434
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,880
And from atheists and on the
website there's all kinds of shit.

1435
01:16:43,881 --> 01:16:48,230
Like there's a fake Ted talk given in
the year 2023 or he's talking about how

1436
01:16:48,231 --> 01:16:51,700
like now we can create android so we
have the same power as God. Oh Shit.

1437
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:54,710
And they did such a good job with the
website that you look at it and you're

1438
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:55,041
totally like,

1439
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:59,660
this could be Google and the next like
20 years or whatever big company happens

1440
01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:00,494
to be around.

1441
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,191
I think,
you know,

1442
01:17:01,191 --> 01:17:03,620
I watched promethium and that's one of
the things I thought when there's like,

1443
01:17:03,621 --> 01:17:07,840
you know, if we're from a [inaudible],
you know, the year 2092 or whatever, what,

1444
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:11,140
22 what was, what was the year? Oh yeah,

1445
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:15,200
it was like seven years and it was like
90 years from now or something like that.

1446
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:19,600
Whatever, whatever the fuck is spoilers.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. And uh, I,

1447
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:21,080
when I was looking, I
was like, you know what,

1448
01:17:21,081 --> 01:17:23,960
that is really underestimating how
fucking nutty things are going to be.

1449
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,610
Cause that doesn't even look hardly nutty.

1450
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,670
The only thing that's nutty about that,
they can go further into space.

1451
01:17:28,671 --> 01:17:31,400
They'd go to sleep for a little while
and they got holograms. That ain't shit.

1452
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,860
I think that's really underestimating.

1453
01:17:33,861 --> 01:17:37,580
They sort of interconnectivity that
people are going to enjoy just in the next

1454
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:39,230
decade.
I think it's going to be wait crazy.

1455
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:42,350
And then promethium I'm looking forward
to like a psychic version of Gmail.

1456
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,720
It's going to be like, look,
you're going to be connected.

1457
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:47,000
You're going to be connected to
people in some other weird way.

1458
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:50,240
It's just the same way you are
through your phone in a wireless way.

1459
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,780
Someone's going to figure out how to make
that something that speaks directly to

1460
01:17:53,781 --> 01:17:56,360
your synapsis. They're going
to make it. Yeah, absolutely.

1461
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:57,860
There's gotta be something like that.

1462
01:17:57,861 --> 01:18:01,460
There's going to be something that
allows you either in a clinical setting,

1463
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:04,460
it will probably be that way first and
then it's just going to integrate into

1464
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:06,710
your life. You know? It's
Kinda got to figure out a way.

1465
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:09,560
It's everyone's going to need God.
God Damn Electric toothbrush.

1466
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:10,550
Everyone's going to have one.

1467
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,240
Well, I was, I was kinda disappointed.

1468
01:18:12,241 --> 01:18:13,890
I don't know what you were saying
about probate this earlier,

1469
01:18:13,891 --> 01:18:16,020
but I'm really into that theory too,

1470
01:18:16,021 --> 01:18:19,050
that aliens created us and so I
was like kind of like, fuck yeah,

1471
01:18:19,051 --> 01:18:21,600
they have like a movie about
this. Then I was like, aw man.

1472
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,570
It kind of just wasn't as
good as I thought it would be.

1473
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:28,260
Shit version of the idea.
Such an idea

1474
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:28,841
the,
yeah,

1475
01:18:28,841 --> 01:18:33,520
the ancient aliens theory debunked or
ancient aliens showed debunked is a

1476
01:18:33,521 --> 01:18:38,500
fucking amazing youtube clip where
a guy created this, his names,

1477
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:40,600
well I don't want to say his name,
some it'd be, he doesn't want his name,

1478
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:45,930
but he's got to come on the podcast.
Thank you. So I think he's out. Tom.

1479
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:49,620
Chris. Anyway, so he debunked and
the whole, let's fucking, what am I?

1480
01:18:49,621 --> 01:18:54,170
So it's not like he did anything dangerous
when I'm saying Chris White. Anyways,

1481
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:54,761
very nice guy.

1482
01:18:54,761 --> 01:18:57,970
We've been going back and forth on
Twitter and this guy was a believer at one

1483
01:18:57,971 --> 01:19:01,780
point in time and then just started
looking into all the different things that

1484
01:19:01,781 --> 01:19:06,280
they've claimed on the show and you know
that shows goofy as fuck, but it's fun.

1485
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:10,710
This dude wrecked it. Aw Man.
Crushed it. It means nothing now.

1486
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:12,220
It means nothing.
I mean,

1487
01:19:12,221 --> 01:19:15,580
it's still a lot of mystery until
like the construction methods used for

1488
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,090
building the pyramids and moving
obelisks and stuff like that. But he,

1489
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:22,900
he basically crushed them on
all of their major points.

1490
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:26,010
I heard the diplomat just comes
his hair to the side so glossy.

1491
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,410
He looks like me shaking his
head just like, fuck this.

1492
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,610
It started off really good cause
you're like, all right, the pyramids.

1493
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:35,790
Maybe this other shit in South America.
Maybe.

1494
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:39,220
Then you run out of things to point the
finger at and now it's like bigfoot.

1495
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,520
Was George Washington really influenced
by an alien visitation and it's like

1496
01:19:42,521 --> 01:19:45,130
you're just picking random things that
of history at this point and trying to

1497
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,070
superimpose crazy.
We were doing Samurais.

1498
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:50,050
Yeah, that's what you
need. You've gone too far.

1499
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:55,970
Samurais who could have come up with
the technology to make the sword?

1500
01:19:57,130 --> 01:20:01,840
Could it possibly have been aliens?
Joe, have you seen Sam? Sorry yet? No.

1501
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,760
Oh Man. He's really
fucking shit. What is it?

1502
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:09,400
Have you seen Baraka or choir get
Scott to that trilogy? Dude, oh my God.

1503
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:12,210
It's just a fucking, it's
just all images and, and,

1504
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,850
and really amazing images from all
around the world. Uh, the, you know what,

1505
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:19,890
what did the film's called?
Baraka and Sam. Sarah,

1506
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:23,170
I feel like I'm in a cult because I'm
like telling everyone to watch and see

1507
01:20:23,171 --> 01:20:27,600
what it is, so I forget who directed it.
I want to say Phillip Glass at the music,

1508
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:32,520
but it's just all of the world's wonders
and it's just so intense that it takes

1509
01:20:32,521 --> 01:20:35,760
you into the soul of people and then like
it moves to another image and then it

1510
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:38,790
moves to another image. Like there's a
bunch of people climbing up mount. Yep.

1511
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:44,020
Yeah, I've seen that. Yeah. Yeah.
It's incredible. It's incredible.

1512
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,330
I just feel like I'm,

1513
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:48,510
I feel like I'm tripping on mushrooms
when I watch it because it's just so

1514
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:52,250
intense. Like it's just different
cultures all around the world and the,

1515
01:20:52,251 --> 01:20:53,730
and the juxtaposition between,
you know,

1516
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:56,460
Modern Day society in ancient
cultures and how they,

1517
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:59,580
they're living in the same time
and then it's just incredible.

1518
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:03,690
I bet that's going to be like the first
technology when it comes to like really

1519
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:05,220
tapping into another person's life.

1520
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,000
They're going to create like a real for
us and everyone's going to get the same

1521
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:12,060
real and you'll be able to put it on
cause it takes a long time to record it.

1522
01:21:12,061 --> 01:21:14,730
It's very difficult to process.
So it's going to be like that game.

1523
01:21:14,731 --> 01:21:17,560
Dragon's layer. Do Remember
the game? Dragon's layer? No,

1524
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:21,570
it was the first video game and the
dragon's layer video game wasn't really a

1525
01:21:21,571 --> 01:21:22,404
video game.

1526
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:26,460
Like you would be shown an animated thing
and then you'd have to move the lever

1527
01:21:26,461 --> 01:21:29,290
one way or another way to get
away or to get fucked like you,

1528
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:31,110
like one or one of them doesn't happen.

1529
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:35,250
Either you moved it the right way and
then they would show you a new screen.

1530
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,160
Congratulations and you move on to the
next round or it would show you you

1531
01:21:38,161 --> 01:21:40,200
getting hit in the head by
a giant boulder and dying.

1532
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:41,840
It was the stupidest video game ever,

1533
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:45,060
but it was like really clumsy because
they couldn't quite get it yet.

1534
01:21:45,061 --> 01:21:48,750
Now they have full motion three d graphics
that are absolutely insane and you

1535
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:49,980
play it,
it's full immersion.

1536
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:54,450
I think that's what it's going to be
like the first time you get a chance to

1537
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:55,770
peek into somebody else's brain.

1538
01:21:55,950 --> 01:22:00,090
They're just gonna take a whole just
segment of people from all over the world

1539
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:02,250
and make it into the
one dope ass mix tape,

1540
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:06,210
put it on and get to
like live changing lives.

1541
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:10,170
And then it's gonna move from there to
the point where we're eventually all

1542
01:22:10,171 --> 01:22:12,480
going to have the ability
to transmit and receive.

1543
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:15,820
Just get off the bench. It's gonna be
really cool. They can record brand,

1544
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:20,620
they can record dreams now. Like actually,
uh, get digitally, interpret them. Yeah.

1545
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:24,070
Well they've, they've have been able
to get blurry images for dreams.

1546
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:25,870
They've also been able to,
uh,

1547
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:29,890
get blurry images from memory and they
think that they might be able to figure

1548
01:22:29,891 --> 01:22:34,090
out whether or not people are guilty or
not and whether or not by whether some

1549
01:22:34,091 --> 01:22:37,680
certain images exist in their memory.
If they can grab him.

1550
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:44,440
I think in Grad just that means they
can probably put in images. Yeah, well,

1551
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:48,520
by the way, I bet your imagination
can put those images in there as well.

1552
01:22:48,521 --> 01:22:50,920
And then it becomes the question
of whether or not the mat, I mean,

1553
01:22:50,921 --> 01:22:53,380
how much power does the
imagination have over reality?

1554
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:56,020
Because a lot of people
think that, you know, well,

1555
01:22:56,021 --> 01:23:00,310
imagination is just what's not real.
And a reality is what Israel. Okay.

1556
01:23:00,311 --> 01:23:03,100
You don't want to be too
imaginative, Jimmy, but the,

1557
01:23:03,101 --> 01:23:07,600
the reality is that everything that real
is created because of the imagination.

1558
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:10,060
The imagination is the
reason why we have tables.

1559
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,980
That's the reason why
someone invented a rocket.

1560
01:23:11,981 --> 01:23:13,480
It's a reason why a computer exists.

1561
01:23:13,481 --> 01:23:16,720
If someone had a thinking and then it
manifested itself in the real life,

1562
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:19,990
then the imagination becomes a very
different thing because then it becomes

1563
01:23:19,991 --> 01:23:21,220
something that you know,

1564
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,850
through a human and through the human
touching things and moving things,

1565
01:23:24,851 --> 01:23:28,660
manipulating with this idea,
it can change physical reality.

1566
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:33,460
So it's not just an innocuous little
thing floating in space. The imagination,

1567
01:23:33,461 --> 01:23:35,740
when you sit down and come up with
things and create things and actually

1568
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:39,640
physically make them, it made those
fucking things. It did it through you.

1569
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:43,960
Then the question becomes can it do that
to everything else as well and is it

1570
01:23:43,961 --> 01:23:46,500
just we do,
we look at the imagination is like,

1571
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:49,540
well we can control this because
I'm a creative person and you know,

1572
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:52,720
I drink a lot of coffee and then I
sit down and I do my work. Is it,

1573
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:57,370
is that the case or is the imagination
like a force that moves everything in the

1574
01:23:57,371 --> 01:24:01,540
universe and we're just doing our little
itty bitty bitty part of it? Well, yeah,

1575
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:05,050
I think the placebo effect is a prime
example of something that no one talks

1576
01:24:05,051 --> 01:24:08,770
about, but it's a fucking miracle. You're
like, you're mine did this. Like how come?

1577
01:24:08,771 --> 01:24:09,604
That's amazing.

1578
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:13,180
Why don't we focus more on the fact that
the placebo effect is incredibly mind.

1579
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:16,020
My hands are able to throw it away
because you thought that it was going to

1580
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:21,160
reality might not necessarily
be something you'd knock on.

1581
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:25,750
It might be the the tune of the way you
look at the world and your perceptions

1582
01:24:25,751 --> 01:24:29,890
and your expectations can literally
change what happens. That's a,

1583
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:32,170
that's a hard,
you know what I mean?

1584
01:24:32,171 --> 01:24:35,080
It can't be 100% because
babies dying drive bys.

1585
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,940
There's like some weird
shit that goes on there.

1586
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:41,590
But then there's also the thought
like if this is a continuous cycle,

1587
01:24:41,591 --> 01:24:46,420
that's what so many eastern religions
believe that you will come back and a lot

1588
01:24:46,421 --> 01:24:49,240
of them believe you will come back until
you get it right and you'll keep living

1589
01:24:49,241 --> 01:24:52,210
the same life over and over again
until you do it with zero mistakes.

1590
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:55,840
And you do it as an enlightened being
from the time you were a baby to the time

1591
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:58,450
you leave and then you move on
to the next stage of existence.

1592
01:24:58,451 --> 01:25:00,910
So we're in this constant
and endless cycle.

1593
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:03,940
But if there was a way to,

1594
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,750
to know that you were going to
die and come back as a baby,

1595
01:25:07,751 --> 01:25:11,110
but you had to take a chance that you're
going to be a baby in a good house,

1596
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:14,770
how terrifying would that fucking trip be?
You would never want to die.

1597
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:19,000
He would never want to die because what
if you came up with some fucking asshole

1598
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:22,720
parents? What if you came up
with some abusive environment?

1599
01:25:22,721 --> 01:25:25,690
What if you were born in Ethiopia and
what if you're born some shit part of the

1600
01:25:25,691 --> 01:25:27,760
world where you can't get out,
you're fucked.

1601
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:33,720
If we had people that really believed
that the only way to ensure your Karma,

1602
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:40,120
the only way to ensure you're safe
passage as a child to adulthood is to go

1603
01:25:40,121 --> 01:25:45,121
through this life being as loving and is
careful and as considerate as possible

1604
01:25:46,691 --> 01:25:49,060
and it's spreading as much
positive energy as possible.

1605
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:54,090
If we really could get people to think
that that would change reality because

1606
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:59,260
every baby would grow up in an
environment where people did grow up in an

1607
01:25:59,261 --> 01:26:04,160
environment where people love them because
they didn't want to be stuck in some

1608
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:08,540
fucking shit hole in the middle
of Pakistan in a hut somewhere.

1609
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:12,500
Why drones are shooting missiles over
their heads. I was thinking of Glendale,

1610
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:17,420
I was thinking where the, where the
bombs hit man, where the drone son,

1611
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:22,340
if we get people to believe that you
can get people to think, look the die,

1612
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:26,720
that might be real. I mean, it
really, I mean if, I don't know,

1613
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:30,260
I don't understand the idea of
reincarnation, but if it does exist,

1614
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:33,290
people are going to be terrified if they
could prove that exist. Just that alone,

1615
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:34,670
but free people the fuck out.

1616
01:26:34,671 --> 01:26:37,790
The fact that you just gonna keep coming
back as a person and a new life every

1617
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:42,220
time. If you believe in the Dalai
Lama and what he represents, uh,

1618
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:46,460
they claimed that he has the option of
just like opting out next time you opt

1619
01:26:46,461 --> 01:26:49,280
out of the body scanner at the
Tsa. He can just be like, I'm done.

1620
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:51,770
Like I'm not going to do this.
And he doesn't want to be the Dalai Lama.

1621
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:55,100
And I see that he has that choice.
Like apparently after he dies,

1622
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,280
he can tell whoever's in charge of the,
you coming back in a body can be like,

1623
01:26:58,281 --> 01:27:01,490
I'm just, I'm done with this.
No more earth. He's just,
he has that option. He's,

1624
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:04,850
he seems like a wonderful guy,
but he stuck it in an ideology.

1625
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:09,200
He's dressed like an idiot. He's being
silly as fuck. The whole thing is silly.

1626
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:10,670
It's completely silly.

1627
01:27:10,671 --> 01:27:14,490
This clothes thing where you have to
wear certain clothes to be, I mean you,

1628
01:27:14,491 --> 01:27:18,740
you have to be completely expressionless
in the way you keep your body warm.

1629
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:21,380
That's nonsense. That doesn't make
any sense. If there's a real god,

1630
01:27:21,381 --> 01:27:22,520
he doesn't care if you wear pants,

1631
01:27:22,521 --> 01:27:25,790
it doesn't care if you have
a fucking ACDC tee shirt on,

1632
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,280
he should wear whatever the fuck you want.
That's craziness.

1633
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:31,370
The whole idea that you can have sex
with anybody, I'll come on, you know,

1634
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:34,850
the idea that it takes over and
obsesses your life. Um, no it doesn't.

1635
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:36,230
If you get your shit together stupid,

1636
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,770
the idea that you can't have sex because
it ruins your life doesn't always ruin

1637
01:27:39,771 --> 01:27:42,020
your life dummy.
It's sometimes it enhances your life.

1638
01:27:42,021 --> 01:27:43,880
You're not living 100% full life.

1639
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:47,450
So this idea that you're enlightened yet
not living, stop it. That's nonsense.

1640
01:27:47,451 --> 01:27:49,550
You need to go out and he'd get need
to get drunk and right now and then you

1641
01:27:49,551 --> 01:27:52,970
need to have a shot of whiskey and need
to go to Vegas and see what a real strip

1642
01:27:52,971 --> 01:27:54,980
clubs look like.
Maybe that's maybe that's a Mitt.

1643
01:27:54,981 --> 01:27:59,210
Romney needs just a hard weekend in Vegas.
He needs to go back to Mexico.

1644
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:04,670
It goes back to Mexico and fucking camp
out with the Colton and load rifles as

1645
01:28:04,671 --> 01:28:08,330
they look around for kidnappers. That's
what they do. They talk up a black girl.

1646
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:13,430
I think you just nailed it.
A black girl really likes mushrooms.

1647
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,050
The lack of psychedelic experiences is
a real problem for people that are in

1648
01:28:18,051 --> 01:28:21,970
office. And I say that it
sounds completely ridiculous,
but I really think it's,

1649
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:24,350
you need something as a,
as a human being,

1650
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,640
they need something every now and
then the jolt you out of your walls of

1651
01:28:27,641 --> 01:28:31,910
perception because we get stuck. You get
stuck thinking that this makes sense.

1652
01:28:31,911 --> 01:28:35,530
You get stuck on a momentous
journey where you know the,

1653
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:39,350
the momentum keeps pushing you along the
same path and there's no room to adjust,

1654
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,780
especially if you're part of a
corporation and something big.

1655
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:45,800
Every corporation should have a fucking
retreat every six months where they all

1656
01:28:45,801 --> 01:28:48,380
go to the desert together and they
all trip. They're fucking balls off.

1657
01:28:48,381 --> 01:28:51,050
And then they rethink their life and
then they get together and they have a

1658
01:28:51,051 --> 01:28:52,910
meeting on Monday. And I
go, what do you think? Well,

1659
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:56,810
the fucking Lizard Guy with the tail
and the way he told me, I'm fucking up.

1660
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,690
And uh, they showed me the future
and it's not good. We listen.

1661
01:28:59,691 --> 01:29:00,940
We've got to get these suicides.

1662
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,340
People's hands. Well,
yeah, we can't be making,

1663
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,880
making money off them that this is
fucked. You know, they would, they would,

1664
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:09,740
they would realize the
error of their ways,

1665
01:29:09,741 --> 01:29:14,010
but instead they have a whiskey and an
ambient and they go to sleep. And the,

1666
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:17,240
the drugs that we have available now,
whether it's Oxycontin,

1667
01:29:17,241 --> 01:29:20,770
which is readily available to anybody
that stubs their toe, you know,

1668
01:29:20,771 --> 01:29:22,370
all these different
drugs that are available,

1669
01:29:22,371 --> 01:29:25,160
they're available and they
have a numbing quality to them.

1670
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:28,790
They have a quality that allows
you to not look at the big picture,

1671
01:29:28,791 --> 01:29:33,710
but just play your role and put your
nose down and grin and bear it, you know?

1672
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:36,770
Do you know any fucking people are
on antidepressants during the day and

1673
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:40,010
sleeping pills at night?
It's a staggering number.

1674
01:29:40,011 --> 01:29:41,840
It sends a recipe for insanity,

1675
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:44,480
like some of those civic because you
walk around and don't remember where you

1676
01:29:44,481 --> 01:29:46,640
were. Oh yeah. That happens a lot.

1677
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:47,571
I used to work at a,

1678
01:29:47,571 --> 01:29:50,990
a at a physician's office and he handled
mostly like injuries and every single

1679
01:29:50,991 --> 01:29:52,730
patient that came in there
with like a work injury,

1680
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:55,400
they would get an antidepressant
because they weren't working.

1681
01:29:55,401 --> 01:29:58,580
So obviously they're depressed.
Um, they would get a painkiller,

1682
01:29:58,790 --> 01:30:00,350
they would get like
meloxicam or something,

1683
01:30:00,351 --> 01:30:04,160
but it was like a sedative
and an antianxiety pill.

1684
01:30:04,161 --> 01:30:05,600
And it was like five or six pills at,

1685
01:30:05,601 --> 01:30:09,110
like almost every single patient would
walk out with mass diag, you know,

1686
01:30:09,111 --> 01:30:11,900
just diagnosing everyone that comes
in there with anxiety and depression.

1687
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:16,120
I had no idea it was such an issue
until I had a few friends that,

1688
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:20,190
that got prescribed them and I saw it
like changes in their personnel and so

1689
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:25,160
weirdness, you know, I saw
people that acted irrationally.
And then, uh, especially,

1690
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:26,690
um,
when I was on news radio,

1691
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:29,390
Phil Hartman's wife was on
Zoloft when she killed him,

1692
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:31,460
she was on Zoloft and cocaine.

1693
01:30:31,610 --> 01:30:35,240
And apparently that is a psychotic
combination like literally makes you

1694
01:30:35,241 --> 01:30:36,074
psychotic.

1695
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:39,650
And to the point where the family got
a settlement from Zoloft family got a

1696
01:30:39,651 --> 01:30:42,700
settlement because of that and
it's been shown to have, you know,

1697
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:47,420
horrific effects. So I, I started looking
into it and then I found the numbers,

1698
01:30:47,421 --> 01:30:50,540
the numbers of people that
are on antidepressants and
they're fucking staggering.

1699
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,793
It's staggering.

1700
01:30:51,830 --> 01:30:56,180
And as far as like long term studies to
see what kind of an effect that should

1701
01:30:56,181 --> 01:30:59,830
has on you in 2030 years,
have there been any,

1702
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:01,940
I mean do they know how about
people who don't need them?

1703
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:06,050
Those people are part of an ongoing
experiment. You are the data.

1704
01:31:06,051 --> 01:31:07,910
If you're on those pillars here,
the data that people,

1705
01:31:07,911 --> 01:31:09,100
20 years from now I'll be looking at,

1706
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:12,060
well it's amazing every time there's
like a famous person that dies from,

1707
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,110
from pills that are just like,

1708
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:15,780
oh they don't really talk about it
wouldn't before it was like yeah,

1709
01:31:15,781 --> 01:31:19,080
they died of his speed ball. It's like
now this is legal heroin, legal cocaine,

1710
01:31:19,081 --> 01:31:23,970
legal speed, way crazier. I mean fucking
all the fentanyl patches and shit.

1711
01:31:23,971 --> 01:31:25,260
I mean they're just
like giving this thing.

1712
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:30,210
I called my doctor wants to consult about
birth control and within five minutes

1713
01:31:30,211 --> 01:31:34,740
she was trying to give me an
antidepressant. I wanted to get pregnant.

1714
01:31:34,741 --> 01:31:35,860
Or you didn't want you to know?
No,

1715
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:38,670
I just was calling just to consult about
like different kinds of birth control

1716
01:31:38,671 --> 01:31:41,250
and she was just like, well are you
feeling moody? And she was like,

1717
01:31:41,251 --> 01:31:44,370
let's talk about your like moodiness.
And she was like, I was like,

1718
01:31:44,371 --> 01:31:47,480
is this illegal for you to like try to
push meds on my second for the brain?

1719
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:49,340
It's like if you were

1720
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:52,760
oh you are a person who
like wasn't strong minded,

1721
01:31:52,761 --> 01:31:54,700
you would go it just because
your doctor recommended. Yeah.

1722
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:58,770
America is one of only two countries
in the world that allowed direct to

1723
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,040
consumer advertising with

1724
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,130
pharmaceutical pills, US and
New Zealand. Random. Right.

1725
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:06,700
She's my dad's a doctor and he
hates the ask your doctor about,

1726
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,020
cause you're misleading people.

1727
01:32:08,021 --> 01:32:11,200
Like if you think you have a
symptom and like you're like,

1728
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:13,360
oh I got to ask my doctor
about this to get it fixed.

1729
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:16,420
There are a hundred other diseases that
could be causing that symptom and that's

1730
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:19,600
where you go to a fucking doctor in
the first place so you can be diagnosed

1731
01:32:19,601 --> 01:32:21,160
properly.
But instead what happens is you go,

1732
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:24,730
this must be what I have because the TV
ads so convincing you look it up on web

1733
01:32:24,731 --> 01:32:28,150
MD. It confirms your ex your
expectations. Yeah. This is what I have.

1734
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,860
You go to your doctor and you're like,
here,

1735
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:33,670
you know I've done the research for you
and then you're putting your doctor and

1736
01:32:33,671 --> 01:32:36,970
an awkward situation where if he
doesn't do it, you want them to do.

1737
01:32:36,971 --> 01:32:39,790
You suddenly think he's not
giving you the right care,

1738
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:41,560
but you really have to rely on an expert.

1739
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:44,740
It'd be like you don't see that for cars.
You don't see advertisements for like,

1740
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:47,770
uh, you know you don't, you don't just
walk into a car dealership and say,

1741
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:49,930
here's what's wrong with my car
and need to do this, this and this.

1742
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,070
You tell them to check it out.

1743
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:53,500
It's kind of interesting that you
can't sell cigarettes anymore.

1744
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:55,700
That's the one thing.
You can't sell an ads anymore.

1745
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:57,730
Can't have cigarette
commercials except there's,

1746
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,550
remember that new one we
saw with the electronic
cigarettes? Oh yeah. It so sexy.

1747
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:06,520
Let me try to find who was
Steven Bauer. No, no, no, no.

1748
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:11,780
Stephen Dorff. Yeah. Oh my God. Please
pull that commercial up. Oh my goodness.

1749
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:15,200
Yes they do.
It's not the nicotine.

1750
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:18,200
Nicotine is actually has some
positive effects on the body.

1751
01:33:18,230 --> 01:33:22,310
Nicotine actually is beneficial. It
can help people with heart issues. Uh,

1752
01:33:22,311 --> 01:33:26,930
it helps people be more creative.
Like nicotine itself is as a drug,

1753
01:33:26,931 --> 01:33:29,000
as a compound. Isolated
compounds. Not Bad.

1754
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:33,500
What's bad is when you smoke it and he's
smoking a cigarette form with 590 other

1755
01:33:33,501 --> 01:33:36,410
fucking chemicals, they're all poured
in there by your own, you know,

1756
01:33:36,411 --> 01:33:39,650
approved by your own loving government
just to make those cigarettes more

1757
01:33:39,651 --> 01:33:42,620
addictive. That's when shit gets really
bad. Make them burn a little bit better.

1758
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:46,130
Yeah. Shit into it. But let's be honest,

1759
01:33:46,131 --> 01:33:48,740
this is kind of disturbing to watch
that because it is still nick,

1760
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:52,370
Tina, and people can still get addicted
to nicotine, you know? Yeah, they can.

1761
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,120
You're right. Yeah.
What's, watch this. This is

1762
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,250
beautiful.
I'm Steven door.

1763
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:59,390
I've been a smoker for 20 years and
I just found the smarter alternative.

1764
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:04,050
Blue aesics blue lets
me enjoy smoking without

1765
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,700
sexy years.
He's a rebel.

1766
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:11,690
He's got to James that jacket on
and best of all he said the beach.

1767
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:15,860
He's so cool. He's got a beach
house like we're all adults here.

1768
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:23,720
Hello Ring. Oh my guys. It looks cool.
I just want to go to parties with him.

1769
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:25,010
Oh Stephen Dorff.
Does it

1770
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:26,553
party with him?

1771
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,520
Yeah, that's the kind of, if like
you've met a guy and he liked it,

1772
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:34,830
pulled out a cigarette and started telling
you how awesome it was like that he

1773
01:34:34,831 --> 01:34:38,790
would run like the house was on
fire and we just run away from him.

1774
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:43,670
You who fucking dis design
that commercial commercial.

1775
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:45,270
If you looked in the eyes
of blue smoke like that

1776
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:50,580
actory fuck you dummy. You got to
choose. Either are selling shit.

1777
01:34:50,581 --> 01:34:54,420
Are you going to be an actor? You
can't be all actory. What does that,

1778
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:57,980
what it was that an emotional moment for
Yale? He can considering your nest next

1779
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,410
project on a kick that guy in the balls.
When I said that commercial,

1780
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:04,770
that's insulting. Fucking
insulting commercial. You fool,

1781
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:11,090
but I'm not hating us. Even a for me, if
he got paid, go for it dude. Whatever.

1782
01:35:11,091 --> 01:35:13,880
Just think you could have done a better
job. I think you kind of phoned it in.

1783
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:19,570
I liked you in blade though,
Dude. Pretty sweet and blade.

1784
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,310
That's saying you're a bad actor.

1785
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:24,890
I'm saying that Shit's preposterous
son and take it from me.

1786
01:35:24,891 --> 01:35:28,770
I've done preposterous shit. You got to
know when you did it. You just did some

1787
01:35:30,530 --> 01:35:34,580
black and white walk and by the beach
with your fucking James Dean Jack and on

1788
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:37,490
sucking on a blue robot.
Dick.

1789
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:42,690
That's a blue robot. Dick. You really
need to suck on that blue robotics.

1790
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:48,100
Come on man. Why? Why don't you just get
some Nicorette Gum? You look at my like,

1791
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,390
he's fucking serious.

1792
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:53,450
He's serious and he's going
to say something cool right
before he shows you that

1793
01:35:53,451 --> 01:35:58,160
it's blue. Yeah. This is like a scene in
a movie that's making fun of the future.

1794
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:02,720
That's what it is. Johnny drama. This
is like Johnny drama. Got a commercial.

1795
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:05,090
If he's acting it.
If you are watching like uh,

1796
01:36:05,170 --> 01:36:08,840
like one of those Arnold Schwarzenegger
movies or like the Terminator or

1797
01:36:08,841 --> 01:36:10,850
something like that where if they
were making fun of the future,

1798
01:36:10,851 --> 01:36:12,950
showing you a video of what
the future would be like,

1799
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:17,540
this would be really robot fucking
cigarettes and election man and this silly

1800
01:36:17,541 --> 01:36:21,500
pitch is smoking them. What are you doing
dude? He's a little wrinkly forehead.

1801
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:25,640
He's fucking serious problem. Leno at
a mountain, the Beach Doula surfing.

1802
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:29,920
Sometimes I just move sand
holes.

1803
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:33,160
I'll make trenches and make my own
rivers and they lost mode. You know,

1804
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:36,410
I make like these castles and I loved
the fact that we're not going to be there

1805
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,690
and an hour they're gone,
but they're there now.

1806
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:42,650
I live for now for now
with my blue cigarettes.

1807
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:47,970
I was just thinking how you were saying
that people are just generally an

1808
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:50,960
unhappy because they're overworked.
They're not fucking following their true.

1809
01:36:50,961 --> 01:36:51,591
We'll all this shit.

1810
01:36:51,591 --> 01:36:54,590
I was just thinking the other day watching
the soup because it highlights the

1811
01:36:54,591 --> 01:36:57,800
most ridiculous reality shows that you
can't even believe our fucking on TV.

1812
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:01,780
But just like the, my strange addiction,
like people who eat scotch tape and shit,

1813
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:05,690
you're like, I'm sure they saw
this. They're like, what the fuck?

1814
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,180
I was just only like first world problems.

1815
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:11,870
Like can you imagine anyone
else like having that problem?

1816
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:16,230
Like I can't stop eating couch upholstery.
I have a problem. How about PD?

1817
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:20,190
The first world problems Hashtag
on Twitter that people, yes. Yes.

1818
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:24,290
They took some of those tweets that were
popular and they super imposed them or

1819
01:37:24,291 --> 01:37:27,470
they didn't superimposed and they had
kids and like really poor people in Haiti.

1820
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:29,810
Oh God. All right. This shit.
It's a video you can look up.

1821
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:32,570
It's like Katie first world problems
and it's like, I hate how my,

1822
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:36,650
my two door garage takes like 10 seconds
to open and your mother were like

1823
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:38,870
starving animals in the background
and stuff and it's like,

1824
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:39,810
it starts to hit home.

1825
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:42,110
Like you're kind of an asshole if you
spend all day tweeting about stuff like

1826
01:37:42,111 --> 01:37:42,630
that.

1827
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:45,800
Like it's okay to acknowledge that like
you're privileged and you have a lot of

1828
01:37:45,801 --> 01:37:48,050
shit that most people on earth don't have.
But a certain point,

1829
01:37:48,051 --> 01:37:51,140
maybe you give $20 to your favorite
charity instead of tweeting that all

1830
01:37:51,141 --> 01:37:53,690
afternoon. Yay. Silly Bitch. Hey Brian.

1831
01:37:53,691 --> 01:37:56,250
How funny was that a video
that you pulled up yesterday

1832
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:58,990
and silent live video. You want to
pull it out? Should we pull it out?

1833
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:01,110
It's so funny. They did a fight for, I've,

1834
01:38:01,111 --> 01:38:04,030
I haven't washed out and lived a long
time cause siren live went through this.

1835
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,390
It's really went through
a spell where it was just,

1836
01:38:06,391 --> 01:38:08,130
I couldn't watch isn't it getting better?
I don't know.

1837
01:38:08,131 --> 01:38:10,110
I heard but this is fucking fantastic.

1838
01:38:10,111 --> 01:38:13,590
This is the first thing that I've seen
from them in years and I only saw it

1839
01:38:13,591 --> 01:38:15,120
because Brian was watching the computer,

1840
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:19,580
but it's them making fun
of people complaining about
apple products and then the

1841
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:23,700
people who answer or the Foxconn
employees. Holy Shit. Is it funny to do?

1842
01:38:23,701 --> 01:38:26,930
You got it.
Tyna nbc.com unfortunately,

1843
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:31,470
so I'm trying to watch the
commercial right now. Oh,
you have to watch a 32nd one.

1844
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:36,710
What did it, I'm trying to sell you
missiles. They did it, but yeah, yeah.

1845
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:40,800
Don't be complainant bitch. You can
easily be born in Ethiopia with no feet.

1846
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:42,780
Maybe we'll be,
if you can play,

1847
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:46,380
maybe that mother fucker is
a medium for knowledge there.

1848
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:51,360
Could you imagine if everybody that was
in a shit situation just he used to mock

1849
01:38:51,361 --> 01:38:54,990
people and shit situations in the
last life. If it was that cut and dry,

1850
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:58,260
it was that easy to follow
where the Kardashians headed.

1851
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:01,560
I feel like they're not real.

1852
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:05,940
I feel like probably from another
planet and it's some sort of a,

1853
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:10,440
a device they're using to gauge
our stupidity, like saying no,

1854
01:39:10,441 --> 01:39:13,770
it's like a robot. It's like girl,
she's like a robot fucked off in space.

1855
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:18,410
That's what I think because
they've totally overestimated
or position like her,

1856
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:22,500
her, uh, her physique rather, I mean her
ass is just completely out of control.

1857
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:25,050
It's gotten just insane.

1858
01:39:25,051 --> 01:39:28,110
It is growing and it's not growing in
a natural way because their legs aren't

1859
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:28,890
growing with it.

1860
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:32,040
Like if she became like some crazy power
lifter and she just developed these

1861
01:39:32,041 --> 01:39:35,880
giant muscular thighs, this huge
ass, that would make sense. But no,

1862
01:39:35,881 --> 01:39:37,290
someone in youtube describe it best.

1863
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:41,630
He said it looks like a diaper
filled with putting, yeah,

1864
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:44,610
that's what it looks like. It looks like
it's like she's doing something to it.

1865
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:49,040
She's making it bigger. The only episode
I ever accidentally saw that show lies.

1866
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:53,350
Let me see your DVR right now.
So I was the one,

1867
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:57,120
she had her like ass x ray to like try
to prove that there was no implants.

1868
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:59,850
Really. So that only leaves
like a couple of other options.

1869
01:39:59,851 --> 01:40:02,300
It's a good use of healthcare resources.
Well,

1870
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:04,890
how do we know it's a real doctor
by the way? If it was covered, shit,

1871
01:40:04,891 --> 01:40:07,380
his insurance,
I mean most of the,

1872
01:40:07,410 --> 01:40:11,710
like when they walk into a place and
everybody goes, oh hi, nice to see you.

1873
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:13,070
There's a fucking camera already there.

1874
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:16,000
They're showing you an
over the shoulder shot.

1875
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:19,260
It's a fucking camera behind you and
you're pretending you didn't know she was

1876
01:40:19,261 --> 01:40:19,680
coming.

1877
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:23,230
We had a stop that he had a reality show
coming into one of the doctor's office

1878
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:24,600
I worked in and I was like,

1879
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:27,570
I think she was like a
gymnast or something and they
just came in with cameras.

1880
01:40:27,571 --> 01:40:29,550
But of course they were supposed
to pretend like, oh, hey,

1881
01:40:29,551 --> 01:40:33,270
you know what's wrong with you?
It's fucking ridiculous.

1882
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:35,510
They don't have real
reality shows anymore.

1883
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:38,940
What they have is like these low end
producer guys who look sort of dictate

1884
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:42,240
what's going to happen in these scenes
and then these clumsy fucks act it out.

1885
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:46,410
I watched a whole episode of Jersey shore
the other day in my green room before

1886
01:40:46,411 --> 01:40:51,411
a show where the situation wanted to
leave and nobody else wanted to leave.

1887
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:53,150
And that was the whole show.

1888
01:40:55,720 --> 01:41:00,370
And I'm not exaggerating,
sneaky, no, no, no, no, no.

1889
01:41:00,371 --> 01:41:04,390
They were at a club or a club and
uh, you know one's guy like, hey,

1890
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:07,000
you know the mall, he's an Asshole,
but it is for me because you know,

1891
01:41:07,001 --> 01:41:11,500
they get all the beaches and then snuck.
He was like, I'm not leaving. Fuck you.

1892
01:41:11,501 --> 01:41:14,740
I'm not leaving. And he's like, it's
time to go. Like you wanted to leave.

1893
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:16,000
Nobody else wanted to leave.

1894
01:41:16,001 --> 01:41:19,860
And that was the whole thing was them
playing on this and you got to know like

1895
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:23,680
99% of that's horse shit. That's doesn't,
they're not really having this argument.

1896
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:26,140
They just decide that this is
what it's going to be tonight.

1897
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,750
Tonight it's going to be the situation.
Tries to get girls,

1898
01:41:28,751 --> 01:41:31,990
but he's too aggressive so he wants to
leave and then they, you know, they have,

1899
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:37,050
they did make it drama. They, they
turned it into like a script I live had,

1900
01:41:37,051 --> 01:41:38,920
there's a channel called real TV,

1901
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:42,760
but every single show on it's fake fake
reality shows. Well you remember what,

1902
01:41:42,761 --> 01:41:44,800
how they're doing minding the store.
You know,

1903
01:41:44,870 --> 01:41:48,310
when they were doing the Pauly shore,
uh, comedy thing, comedy store thing,

1904
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:50,980
or they had like a scenario that they
would do every day. I look at it,

1905
01:41:51,150 --> 01:41:51,983
that's how they do all,

1906
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:56,980
they don't trust that it would be like
interesting enough to just follow your

1907
01:41:56,981 --> 01:42:01,450
wife. I think it was Rutgers that paid
snuck. He like 40 g to speak there.

1908
01:42:01,451 --> 01:42:03,370
I was like, if I was a
student, I did fucking quit.

1909
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:06,810
Like I'm not paying my tuition to
pay sneaky to teach me life lessons.

1910
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:10,720
You get a refund.
It would be fascinating.

1911
01:42:10,721 --> 01:42:12,670
Now if she couldn't leave of,

1912
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:16,960
she had a certain amount of time and
she had to answer questions, come on.

1913
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:20,330
That would be fun. That would be, she
can't just not worth 40 grand, but yes,

1914
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:23,230
I wouldn't know. $40 I would
sit through that and watch that.

1915
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:27,210
It'll be fascinating though, just to pick
her brain. I don't, you know, I'm, I'm, I,

1916
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:30,520
I wouldn't, I don't hate her.
She, who wouldn't do that if they,

1917
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:35,920
if you were, you were her, she was you. I
would fuck it. Do exactly the same thing.

1918
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:36,783
That's the thing was shitty

1919
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:38,540
people in general, like
you think like, all right,

1920
01:42:38,541 --> 01:42:42,080
if I were given the power to do this,
this, and this, what I act any different.

1921
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:46,140
If I were like a riot cop and I was
coming from that background and like a,

1922
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:50,450
B and c were set up as such, could
I be any different, you know,

1923
01:42:50,730 --> 01:42:54,660
well, you become with the riot cops
are real extreme example. Obviously

1924
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:59,550
pick the most experienced the most. Mostly
you're, you're on the enemy. You know,

1925
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,890
you, you just, it becomes you versus them.

1926
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:05,580
There's no way of avoiding that and you'd
have to be from a different culture.

1927
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,930
You know, I think there's a,
things have happened in some,

1928
01:43:08,980 --> 01:43:10,490
some countries where the,

1929
01:43:10,491 --> 01:43:14,100
the people and the police officers
don't have the same sort of antagonistic

1930
01:43:14,101 --> 01:43:17,940
relationship to the United States. People
do. But in the United States, if you are,

1931
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:22,170
if you're a riot cop in this riot,
you're the enemy. You know, it's like,

1932
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:25,440
you know that guy's got a club and he's
wearing a bulletproof vest and a fucking

1933
01:43:25,441 --> 01:43:28,530
helmet. It's, you would,

1934
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,160
it'd be real hard for you to not act in
self preservation by staying with the

1935
01:43:32,161 --> 01:43:32,900
group.

1936
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:35,260
We were discussing that
like level of escalation,

1937
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:38,900
how the police were allowed to be like
one level of hostility above you and they

1938
01:43:38,901 --> 01:43:42,260
have like clear define levels of
hostility and if, if you're at one level,

1939
01:43:42,261 --> 01:43:44,270
they can be one level
above you at all times,

1940
01:43:44,271 --> 01:43:47,780
which I guess it's supposed to be
a deterrent from picking up a rock.

1941
01:43:47,781 --> 01:43:51,710
But the problem is at the same time they
have people that are in clothes that

1942
01:43:51,711 --> 01:43:54,710
are police officers doing things
like that to antagonize the crowd.

1943
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,550
So they can move to the next

1944
01:43:56,590 --> 01:44:00,280
level. Yeah. The next escalation they're
called agent provocateurs. They just,

1945
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:02,710
it was one of the occupy photos.
It's hilarious.

1946
01:44:02,950 --> 01:44:04,630
You see these fucking cops and the cops,

1947
01:44:04,631 --> 01:44:08,770
I'll have these Vibram work duty
in boots on and so did the guys.

1948
01:44:08,771 --> 01:44:12,130
They're handcuffing handcuffing your bio
protestors and they all have the same

1949
01:44:12,131 --> 01:44:15,070
fucking boots on.
It is the most ridiculous thing because,

1950
01:44:15,071 --> 01:44:17,830
and then people could say, well would
anybody could buy those boots? Yeah,

1951
01:44:17,831 --> 01:44:21,250
but everybody, all three of those
guys like the black hats on.

1952
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:24,310
You're watching a puppet show.
I mean you're watching a puppet show now.

1953
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,550
Now you're watching them act.
This is,

1954
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:29,320
these guys are acting like they're
bad guys now. Like it's like a show.

1955
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,360
Like cops are arresting cops,

1956
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:34,420
they're arresting cops and then it
gives them the power to go in and arrest

1957
01:44:34,421 --> 01:44:37,540
everybody else. Cause now we obviously
have a violent protest so we escalate.

1958
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:40,470
So instead of it being what it really is,
it becomes a show.

1959
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:43,480
There's a video of one of them
like kicking a window in and a,

1960
01:44:43,481 --> 01:44:46,390
it's like a real tight video.
If you watch it from like the media side,

1961
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:49,480
but there's actually someone recording
it with a phone really far away and when

1962
01:44:49,481 --> 01:44:53,860
you look at their angle, you can see not
only like all the media surrounding him,

1963
01:44:53,861 --> 01:44:54,581
not stopping him,

1964
01:44:54,581 --> 01:44:57,610
but there's police across the corner
or like across the street just standing

1965
01:44:57,611 --> 01:45:00,320
there like letting him bash the
window in and it was just right.

1966
01:45:00,370 --> 01:45:02,450
It's perfect. It feeds
into the police line. Like,

1967
01:45:02,650 --> 01:45:05,710
I mean they love the black
bloc shit like a NATO and Ga.

1968
01:45:05,711 --> 01:45:07,180
Like there were people
running around like,

1969
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:10,120
like someone like lit a cop crown fire,
and they were just,

1970
01:45:10,121 --> 01:45:11,300
the cops didn't do anything about it.

1971
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:14,500
It just gives them justification to just
do mass arrests and use crowd control

1972
01:45:14,501 --> 01:45:16,230
methods that are completely unjustified.

1973
01:45:16,690 --> 01:45:19,840
Yeah, and for people who think that
that's horseshit, you just need to watch.

1974
01:45:20,020 --> 01:45:23,440
There's a, there's a documentary, I
mean it's an Alex Jones documentary,

1975
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:28,160
which ones settle in, but it's a nine
11, the road to tyranny. And what, what,

1976
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:32,860
what's in it that's the most spectacular
is that he details and outlines the,

1977
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:37,450
the introduction of these agent
provocateurs into this peaceful, um,

1978
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,390
a settlement or this
peaceful a disagreement.

1979
01:45:40,570 --> 01:45:44,170
So these people are all protesting
everyone. There's no rocks thrown,

1980
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:45,070
nothing's happening.

1981
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:48,070
And then all of a sudden these dudes
come in and they're dressed in black and

1982
01:45:48,071 --> 01:45:51,520
they have military boots on and they
started breaking windows and turning cars

1983
01:45:51,521 --> 01:45:55,410
over and going crazy. And then they all
hold up in a fucking building, something.

1984
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:55,670
I,

1985
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:59,140
I don't even want to get into it and full
depth cause it's a long and drawn out

1986
01:45:59,141 --> 01:46:02,860
thing,
but he details it with news accounts.

1987
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:05,950
He's showing you the actual footage
of what's going on. He, and it's,

1988
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:06,971
it's preposterous.

1989
01:46:06,971 --> 01:46:10,090
Like you look at it and then what happens
after it will act after the police

1990
01:46:10,091 --> 01:46:13,930
came in and broke up the peaceful protest
and, and, and it turned into violence.

1991
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:17,860
And then the arrest, all the, uh, the
fake cops or the fake fake protestors,

1992
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:21,520
then they make a no protest zone.
So you can't even have,

1993
01:46:21,521 --> 01:46:22,690
it was the World Trade Organization.

1994
01:46:22,691 --> 01:46:26,320
You couldn't even have people that had
a badge on with a red stripe through the

1995
01:46:26,321 --> 01:46:29,440
WTO. They were stopping
them from going to work.

1996
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:32,640
These people had book bags with
WTO on it and they're like,

1997
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:36,850
this is a no protest zone. A fucking
no protests on. Like, you can't go.

1998
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:41,230
And this is all, I mean, it's not, there's
the, the narrative aside, it's, you know,

1999
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:45,190
this is all documented. It's all very
clear. It shows you the car, the car,

2000
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:48,910
you see the cop tell her to take
the fucking pin off of her book bag.

2001
01:46:48,911 --> 01:46:53,760
And like what HR three 47. Yeah. Well,

2002
01:46:53,761 --> 01:46:56,210
it's also, you know, I mean,
when they get really nutty,

2003
01:46:56,211 --> 01:47:00,030
it's when they start talking about Timothy
Mcveigh in Oklahoma City and how many

2004
01:47:00,031 --> 01:47:03,030
antiterrorism provisions were
passed right after Oklahoma City.

2005
01:47:03,031 --> 01:47:07,530
All these different things that they
could do after that was passed in order to

2006
01:47:07,531 --> 01:47:08,550
surveil into,

2007
01:47:08,570 --> 01:47:13,260
do you so what used to be illegal
surveillance and that building, you know,

2008
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:16,170
that's that whole thing is crazy.
That Timothy Mcveigh thing,

2009
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:18,240
if you talk to people that
are demolitions experts,

2010
01:47:18,241 --> 01:47:21,450
they said there's no way a truck filled
with fertilizer can make an explosion

2011
01:47:21,451 --> 01:47:25,000
like that. It's not what it does. I said,
it doesn't have that kind of an impact.

2012
01:47:25,010 --> 01:47:27,510
Does it mean they can, you can kill
people with it, no doubt about it,

2013
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:30,450
but it's not going to blow the whole
fucking building apart like that.

2014
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:35,430
That's an insane bomb and probably not
even just one bomb and it blew everything

2015
01:47:35,470 --> 01:47:38,370
outward. Like if you look at
them, the point of impact,

2016
01:47:38,371 --> 01:47:41,310
the guy parks his truck right in the front
of the building and then blows it up,

2017
01:47:41,311 --> 01:47:43,110
right? That's, that's what
we're supposed to believe. Well,

2018
01:47:43,111 --> 01:47:47,250
the fucking buildings blown outward. Like
there's most of the buildings missing.

2019
01:47:47,251 --> 01:47:51,720
Like the whole front of the building's
gone and fertilizer in a fucking truck

2020
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:55,350
can do that. He was supposed to have
as this fertilizer. Yeah, but, but no,

2021
01:47:55,351 --> 01:47:56,490
because the FBI,

2022
01:47:56,491 --> 01:48:01,230
they have the news footage of the Spi
taking bombs that didn't explode and

2023
01:48:01,231 --> 01:48:02,370
removing them from the building.

2024
01:48:02,371 --> 01:48:05,790
They had a bomb squad that
removed additional bombs
from the building because in

2025
01:48:05,791 --> 01:48:08,400
the moments after September
or after Oklahoma City,

2026
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:10,920
there was a lot of confusion as to what
happened before they put the narrative

2027
01:48:10,921 --> 01:48:13,380
out there and before they say that
this is what happened, this is the guy.

2028
01:48:13,381 --> 01:48:15,750
And there was a lot of confusion
as to what really took place.

2029
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:19,070
And while that confusion is being
taken by sis, news reports of FBI guys,

2030
01:48:19,071 --> 01:48:21,900
we're moving bombs from the building
and those were never like tied to him in

2031
01:48:21,901 --> 01:48:23,040
the trial or anything like that.

2032
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:27,600
Now there is also very important now the
second guy who was in the car the whole

2033
01:48:27,601 --> 01:48:31,770
time, like just another, yeah. And
not only that, the, um, the, the, the,

2034
01:48:31,771 --> 01:48:34,680
the agents who were in that building all
evacuated the building before the bomb

2035
01:48:34,681 --> 01:48:35,240
went off.

2036
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:36,960
Yeah. This is pre internet media, right?

2037
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:40,350
So of course when you put
out the official narrative,

2038
01:48:40,351 --> 01:48:44,330
it fills in the gaps in people's
minds. Yeah. It's like a, you ask, uh,

2039
01:48:44,820 --> 01:48:47,370
an acquaintance, what'd you think
of the hot girl wearing the red hat?

2040
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:51,360
We just pass by. Most people go, yeah, she
was hot. Even if that girl did not exist,

2041
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:54,900
right? You fill in the
blanks and especially after
something traumatic happens,

2042
01:48:54,901 --> 01:48:57,480
you want somebody out there with
the voice of authority to say,

2043
01:48:57,540 --> 01:49:00,690
this is what happened. Now you know,
now it's not a fucking mystery.

2044
01:49:00,691 --> 01:49:03,990
We can move on with our lives. And you
pretty much accept whatever they say.

2045
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:08,270
Yeah, no doubt. No doubt about it.
I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's,

2046
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:11,750
we live in a shocking world and if
something like operation Northwoods is

2047
01:49:11,751 --> 01:49:12,261
possible,

2048
01:49:12,261 --> 01:49:15,830
that one point in time they had decided
they were going to sacrifice American

2049
01:49:15,831 --> 01:49:18,980
lives. And then you hear about
the Dick Cheney plan to do this.

2050
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:23,110
The very same thing in Iran at the
end of the Bush administration. You,

2051
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:25,730
you got to wonder what we're,
what we don't know about

2052
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:29,510
what about General Wesley Clark's coming
out and I think it was 2007 where he

2053
01:49:29,511 --> 01:49:31,700
said that he was given that paper,
uh,

2054
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:36,740
classified memos saying that they wanted
to invade seven countries in five years.

2055
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:38,530
And this was all laid out.
Yeah.

2056
01:49:38,531 --> 01:49:42,590
This is like a week after nine
or something like here it is.

2057
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:46,040
What did it say?
What the other countries where,

2058
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:48,100
cause I'm sure can pull it up online.

2059
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:51,000
Do you want to pull it up on mine suite
here? Wesley Clark Sad. Brian one.

2060
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:53,010
Find that because it's,
if you want us,

2061
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:57,950
the last piece of hope and in between
that and just agent provocateurs,

2062
01:49:57,970 --> 01:50:00,030
there's been a lot of uh,
uh,

2063
01:50:00,310 --> 01:50:04,300
agents like going in and using like
entrapment techniques to like get people

2064
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:07,300
arrested. Well, of course, not only that,
they've actually supplied them with,

2065
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:11,260
they could have never had in the first
place something like 18 year old kid

2066
01:50:11,261 --> 01:50:13,430
who's just like, you know,
he can be taught, I mean,

2067
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:18,380
so like vulnerable and can be
talking about all FBI facilitation.

2068
01:50:18,410 --> 01:50:21,850
They could not do what they are saying
that they can do without the FBI

2069
01:50:21,851 --> 01:50:25,810
completely controlling and manufacturing
the way just providing him with it.

2070
01:50:25,811 --> 01:50:27,740
It's like talking them
into doing well by the way,

2071
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:29,940
introducing that idea into
their head. I mean, right.

2072
01:50:30,910 --> 01:50:35,470
When you have a person and that person
benefits from getting you to do something

2073
01:50:35,471 --> 01:50:38,110
that is illegal and they
benefit by getting a collar,

2074
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:39,640
they'd benefit and you didn't,

2075
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:42,760
you didn't have this plan in effect
until you came into contact with them.

2076
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:44,680
How could that possibly be legal?

2077
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:47,890
Because you're just counting
the possibility that that
could be influencing,

2078
01:50:48,070 --> 01:50:48,903
first of all,

2079
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:52,450
what kind of a deceptive person are they
that they can pretend they're so good,

2080
01:50:52,451 --> 01:50:53,950
they can trick you and B,

2081
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:57,130
they could pretend that they're on your
side when meanwhile they're the enemy.

2082
01:50:57,490 --> 01:51:00,470
I mean, if you're, if you're
a terrorist and the FBI is in,

2083
01:51:00,471 --> 01:51:02,560
in the myths and pretending
to be one of you,

2084
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:06,910
he's such a good manipulator that
he can pretend to be you. I mean,

2085
01:51:06,911 --> 01:51:09,940
this guy's an excellent bullshitter.
And then on top of that,

2086
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:12,700
he comes up with a plan.
Listen man,

2087
01:51:12,701 --> 01:51:15,670
we're going to stick it to the man and
you're like, Hey, what are we going to do?

2088
01:51:15,671 --> 01:51:18,730
I want to get you some c four who had
to blow this motherfucker. You're like,

2089
01:51:18,731 --> 01:51:21,820
are you sure about that? And you're
like, oh yeah, I got it covered.

2090
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:25,510
Let me just do everything.
That guy that got arrested in Dallas,

2091
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:27,820
that kid was a fucking moron.
I mean,

2092
01:51:27,821 --> 01:51:32,020
he was a dumb kid and they talked to
him in to making this attack. They,

2093
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:35,380
they gave him a fake bomb and
they let him try to detonate it.

2094
01:51:35,410 --> 01:51:36,760
They tell them everything to do.

2095
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:39,880
They did and they failed this
kid up with hypnosis. I mean,

2096
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:42,460
I'm not discounting the fact that he,
you know,

2097
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:46,330
anybody that is willing to
just detonate this fake bomb,

2098
01:51:46,370 --> 01:51:47,830
it should be removed anyway.

2099
01:51:47,831 --> 01:51:51,060
I mean they did an awesome service cause
they got a fucking moron off the street.

2100
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:53,470
And if it wasn't the FBI that
talk this kid in a doing that,

2101
01:51:53,471 --> 01:51:57,910
it could have been actual terrorist
is a moron. That guy's that guys,

2102
01:51:57,911 --> 01:51:59,610
I'm glad I didn't run into
him at the supermarket.

2103
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:03,190
Some extent you need people like that
who are infiltrating groups just to get

2104
01:52:03,191 --> 01:52:04,460
rid of the supermarket.
Uh,

2105
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:09,310
I think we've seen evidence of it going
away too far where they are the problem.

2106
01:52:09,311 --> 01:52:13,060
Like well how about the one in Florida
where they're hiring undercover cops to

2107
01:52:13,061 --> 01:52:18,040
pretend to be high school students to
get weed getting stronger and, and laws.

2108
01:52:18,041 --> 01:52:19,480
And this is something that
we could actually fix.

2109
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:24,490
Well how about the one where there's a
25 year old woman who convinces a 17 year

2110
01:52:24,491 --> 01:52:26,350
old honor roll student and get her weed?

2111
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:31,380
Some horn tries to give it to her as a
gift and she insisted he take money for

2112
01:52:31,481 --> 01:52:35,950
it and then he's arrested because
she's so horny. Little, no nothing kid.

2113
01:52:35,951 --> 01:52:38,320
And he gets fucking locked
away. It's insane. It's insane.

2114
01:52:38,321 --> 01:52:40,810
But yet this is all done with
tax dollars. You know, we're,

2115
01:52:40,850 --> 01:52:44,750
we're paying for them to entrap
17 year olds with boners the bed.

2116
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,070
The best story of entrapment

2117
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,930
that was hardcore failure was this guy.

2118
01:52:47,931 --> 01:52:50,300
And then they get paid like hundreds of
thousands of dollars do this over the

2119
01:52:50,301 --> 01:52:53,330
course of six months to a year.
I mean really longterm shit.

2120
01:52:53,331 --> 01:52:57,860
And so this guy was in a mosque trying
to rally up like some terrorist activity

2121
01:52:57,861 --> 01:53:00,940
and they actually reported hinder the
FBI there like some crazy motherfucker

2122
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:05,030
isn't here trying to like talk to him.
We got this one

2123
01:53:07,210 --> 01:53:11,370
so silly. It's so awkward. Surveillance.

2124
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:13,940
Well the Da,
if the fact that they can go,

2125
01:53:13,941 --> 01:53:15,950
they have the time to go
after pot when there's math,

2126
01:53:15,951 --> 01:53:17,390
it's like did you clean up all the math?

2127
01:53:18,230 --> 01:53:22,690
You didn't clean up the mess
because the pots recently,

2128
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:26,990
some kid wrote like fuck the DEA on his
Facebook page and now he's being charged

2129
01:53:26,991 --> 01:53:30,870
with a felony or something saying, well I
apparently threatened me. You just said,

2130
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:34,970
you know, said something
fucked up. There's three words.

2131
01:53:34,971 --> 01:53:38,270
It's not the most eloquent, eloquent way
to argue against the agency's policies.

2132
01:53:38,271 --> 01:53:40,730
But if that's what puts you in prison,
like learning the word well,

2133
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,620
agencies are a problem.
It's a problem.

2134
01:53:42,621 --> 01:53:45,110
When you boil things down to three
letters, when you have power,

2135
01:53:45,111 --> 01:53:48,500
because of those three letters you say
open up, it's the FBI. Like Holy Shit,

2136
01:53:48,501 --> 01:53:51,890
the FBI's here. It's not like
no knock knock. Who is it? Well,

2137
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:56,920
my name is Mike and on the machine guns
is Peter and Tom and behind them is a

2138
01:53:57,330 --> 01:54:00,930
delivery with a battering Ram
and Bob's his backup and a,

2139
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:05,690
well we're here because we heard that you
uh, you have some plants or something.

2140
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:09,410
I mean that doesn't sound right, but
open up. It's the DEA like Holy Shit,

2141
01:54:09,411 --> 01:54:10,490
the DEA is here.

2142
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:13,100
Like whenever you have people like that
in a group and you give them like a

2143
01:54:13,101 --> 01:54:17,390
little name like that, it just puts some
mythical fucking no. Yeah. It's like,

2144
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:21,410
it's like it's a giant power group.

2145
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:25,310
Pick them off stealing goods.
What's tragic about that is like you said,

2146
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:28,970
the math is still out there.
Like these agencies have an actual role.

2147
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:30,590
And instead they focused
on the wrong shit.

2148
01:54:30,591 --> 01:54:33,650
Like it'd be great to get meth out of
people's hands because it destroys lives.

2149
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:34,820
The great if you've got an Oxycontin,

2150
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:38,810
so it'd be great if the FBI focused on
the tremendous amount of financial fraud

2151
01:54:38,811 --> 01:54:39,591
happening right now.

2152
01:54:39,591 --> 01:54:43,280
Like half the emails and my fucking
spam folder or people directly trying to

2153
01:54:43,281 --> 01:54:46,860
defraud me out of money in some
way. That's just amazing. Nigerians,

2154
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:49,940
I know a lot of us, a lot of that
spans so many, so many people.

2155
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:51,351
I don't fall for that shit,

2156
01:54:51,351 --> 01:54:53,240
but my point is a lot of
people out there in America do,

2157
01:54:53,390 --> 01:54:56,230
especially older people who don't
use the internet as much. Yeah.

2158
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:57,350
That should be looked into.

2159
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:00,740
And the people who directly benefited
from the financial crisis that should be

2160
01:55:00,741 --> 01:55:01,880
looked into.
It's not,

2161
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:04,760
instead they're focused on fucking
occupiers and journalists. Well,

2162
01:55:04,761 --> 01:55:06,740
the problem is it's compartmentalize too.

2163
01:55:06,741 --> 01:55:11,690
It's like how many people do they have
that are on the police force and whatever

2164
01:55:11,691 --> 01:55:14,870
Florida town that was there supposed
to be gathering up, we'd, you know,

2165
01:55:14,871 --> 01:55:17,320
I mean how many, how many people did they
have that are supposed to get arrest?

2166
01:55:17,330 --> 01:55:21,590
Like, it's not like those people
can instead be allocated, you know,

2167
01:55:21,591 --> 01:55:22,820
in some sort of a positive way.

2168
01:55:22,821 --> 01:55:26,090
Like you'd have to like change their job
because if their job is to go out and

2169
01:55:26,091 --> 01:55:27,290
bust people for drugs,

2170
01:55:27,570 --> 01:55:30,320
well that's their job and they're going
to do it as long as that job exists.

2171
01:55:30,321 --> 01:55:31,640
And if that job doesn't exist,

2172
01:55:31,641 --> 01:55:33,440
well then they're out of work and
they got to find something new to do.

2173
01:55:33,441 --> 01:55:37,730
So they're going to resist that job being
being taken away as well. So it's, it's,

2174
01:55:37,750 --> 01:55:42,230
it gets to be a weird
thing of entanglement where
we have private prisons,

2175
01:55:42,231 --> 01:55:44,090
we have, you know, cops

2176
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,690
and, and, and police officers,

2177
01:55:45,691 --> 01:55:47,940
unions that are lobbying to
keep certain things illegal.

2178
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:49,710
We have a big entanglement.

2179
01:55:49,850 --> 01:55:51,050
Yeah, no, yeah. Also,

2180
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:53,810
banks are laundry and trillions of
dollars with the drug money. Yeah.

2181
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:56,180
Oh yeah.
What was that a Wacovia?

2182
01:55:56,300 --> 01:56:00,500
It's like 400 400 something million
dollars, which is so stupid.

2183
01:56:00,501 --> 01:56:04,070
Make the shit legal, make everything
legal, stop being silly. You know? Let,

2184
01:56:04,071 --> 01:56:07,670
let people make their own fucking choices.
And if you want to do math,

2185
01:56:08,270 --> 01:56:10,700
you're going to get in any way you're
going to get math and you know,

2186
01:56:10,701 --> 01:56:14,600
we should fucking heavily punished any
company that wants to sell it to the

2187
01:56:14,601 --> 01:56:18,220
point where it's not even financially
viable. Take that money. If you're going,

2188
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:21,470
you really sell math, you're fucking
touch a piece of shit. I mean,

2189
01:56:21,471 --> 01:56:22,910
it's not like the data's not in,

2190
01:56:22,911 --> 01:56:26,480
it's not like there's meth advocates out
there going, dude, my life was terrible.

2191
01:56:26,510 --> 01:56:30,140
So I started smoking the nap and it's
like, I just saw it different. I was like,

2192
01:56:30,141 --> 01:56:32,390
I didn't need to be kinder to people.
That doesn't happen.

2193
01:56:32,630 --> 01:56:34,430
There's no math advocate.
So if you're selling meth,

2194
01:56:34,431 --> 01:56:37,400
you're a piece of shit as far as society
is concerned and we should tax you

2195
01:56:37,401 --> 01:56:40,850
heavily. Yeah. You maybe make a living
off of it and maybe feed some Cretins,

2196
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:41,301
you know?

2197
01:56:41,301 --> 01:56:44,330
But people should be responsible for
their actions when they're on drugs.

2198
01:56:44,331 --> 01:56:47,420
That's when they commit crimes.
It's not the fact that you're on drugs.

2199
01:56:47,421 --> 01:56:49,940
If you want to do math and lock yourself
in the basement and just fucking hulk

2200
01:56:49,941 --> 01:56:53,990
out and smashing into walls and shit.
I don't know what I'm saying.

2201
01:56:54,950 --> 01:56:56,750
But if you don't do anything to people,

2202
01:56:56,751 --> 01:56:59,300
who the fuck is anybody to
tell you you can't do that?

2203
01:56:59,330 --> 01:57:02,700
And how do we have a free society if
you can be told what plants you can put

2204
01:57:02,701 --> 01:57:03,430
into your own body,

2205
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:06,770
it's not only that they can shoot you
because there's a 17 year old kids are

2206
01:57:06,771 --> 01:57:10,400
getting like their chances for getting
into college or like ruined forever cause

2207
01:57:10,401 --> 01:57:11,300
I got caught with a joint.

2208
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:13,730
You know they don't think of that
school they need the internet.

2209
01:57:15,810 --> 01:57:18,470
School's going to be awesome to get laid,
but that's where the harmony comes in.

2210
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:20,090
Just need to get on you harm

2211
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:21,970
and just put together a day date,

2212
01:57:22,030 --> 01:57:26,470
a dope profile and you know really
like come up with some good quotes.

2213
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:30,550
Sort about craigslist is the verdict.
Well if you want to hook her,

2214
01:57:30,551 --> 01:57:34,900
that's what she needs to go or a couch
or out. Then the media narrative,

2215
01:57:34,901 --> 01:57:38,260
like just immediately putting it out into
the mainstream to try to solidify some

2216
01:57:38,261 --> 01:57:42,160
sort of narrative or right after nine
11 my mom was like, uh, Uber Patriotic,

2217
01:57:42,161 --> 01:57:43,900
you know the flag phone case,

2218
01:57:43,901 --> 01:57:45,880
fucking first bag out on the
block and shit and stuff.

2219
01:57:45,881 --> 01:57:49,990
My brother and I just discovered this
giant box of magazines and newspapers

2220
01:57:49,991 --> 01:57:53,140
right after nine 11 and you should see
it. I mean Newsweek, Time magazine,

2221
01:57:53,150 --> 01:57:57,310
like two days after nine 11 already
explaining exactly. You know,

2222
01:57:57,490 --> 01:57:58,600
everything laid out,

2223
01:57:58,601 --> 01:58:01,630
all the hijackers bin Ladin the how
the buildings fell down and all the

2224
01:58:01,631 --> 01:58:03,670
countries that going to invade in
the next 10 years. And you're like,

2225
01:58:03,730 --> 01:58:07,090
if you had this much information and they
had to have been fed it just directly

2226
01:58:07,091 --> 01:58:08,410
by the government,
I'm like,

2227
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:11,470
then how come they couldn't prevent
it if they'd already knew all the shit

2228
01:58:11,471 --> 01:58:13,610
within 24 hours to print this publication?
Right.

2229
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:18,590
You have the mind that the nine 11 events
were orchestrated or it's incompetent

2230
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:21,370
I think in part orchestrated for sure.
That's undeniable.

2231
01:58:21,371 --> 01:58:24,520
I mean just the put options
alone shows that, well that's,

2232
01:58:24,521 --> 01:58:28,930
that could just say for knowledge the
put options where all of the, I mean,

2233
01:58:28,931 --> 01:58:31,540
you bet for stocks to
fail on any given day.

2234
01:58:31,570 --> 01:58:34,480
A lot of people bet for certain stocks
and fail. But on this particular day,

2235
01:58:34,481 --> 01:58:36,130
all the airlines that
were involved in nine 11,

2236
01:58:36,131 --> 01:58:39,040
we're bet 25 times more
that they would fail.

2237
01:58:39,041 --> 01:58:42,940
So all these rich white people
pretty much profited immensely.

2238
01:58:43,090 --> 01:58:46,800
So someone's failed stocks.
Someone had to be tipped off and then,

2239
01:58:46,801 --> 01:58:48,790
and then they didn't pursue
it because they said, well,

2240
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:51,310
because it wasn't done by Al Qaeda,

2241
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:54,550
then we're not interested in
pursuing the money ring in your like.

2242
01:58:54,551 --> 01:58:57,820
But that's much more interesting that it
was done by old white men that bet for

2243
01:58:57,821 --> 01:59:00,640
these stocks to fail.
That's much more fascinating to me.

2244
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:04,120
Do we know if there's a list somewhere
of people who benefited? I don't know.

2245
01:59:04,121 --> 01:59:06,940
But also people were warned
not to fly Willie Brown. Uh,

2246
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,360
some other people will have admitted
that they were told not to fly. So,

2247
01:59:10,361 --> 01:59:11,860
I mean there,
there definitely was for knowledge,

2248
01:59:11,861 --> 01:59:14,080
but if you're going into nine 11,
I mean the hijack,

2249
01:59:14,170 --> 01:59:17,920
some of the hijackers lived
with the old mayor. Yeah. Um,

2250
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:22,030
two of the hijackers lived at Pensacola
naval base with under the roof of an FBI

2251
01:59:22,031 --> 01:59:24,830
informant. I mean that's, that's
documented. That's mainstream

2252
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:25,490
news.

2253
01:59:25,490 --> 01:59:30,490
So do you think that they set the whole
thing up and do you think they were real

2254
01:59:31,431 --> 01:59:33,760
hijackers and how'd they get
people to suicide? Bombed?

2255
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:37,230
They were patsy. They don't think that
they knew that they were going to die.

2256
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:40,170
I don't know. I mean, I
don't want to speculate.

2257
01:59:40,171 --> 01:59:42,480
All I know is what I'm
being told is a lie.

2258
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:47,590
How much have you looked into
the, uh, the flying aspect? Alas,

2259
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:51,370
the flying aspect is fascinating when you
talk to people that actually fly those

2260
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:54,190
jets and talk about how difficult
it is to maneuver them correctly,

2261
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:56,650
especially the one where
it hits the Pentagon.

2262
01:59:57,910 --> 02:00:00,010
That's fucking fascinating.

2263
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:03,850
And there's no pieces of
planes and we'll not only that,

2264
02:00:03,910 --> 02:00:08,910
that area where it hits is the same area
where Donald Rumsfeld was on television

2265
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:15,570
just a day before talking about
this trillion plus dollars.

2266
02:00:16,241 --> 02:00:19,390
It's missing some, some dangerous
amount of money that's missing.

2267
02:00:19,780 --> 02:00:23,710
And then the accounting office in the
Pentagon shut down is what gets hit by

2268
02:00:23,711 --> 02:00:26,860
this plane. I mean, that's
where the plane lands.

2269
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:30,220
It's the very offices that we're storing
all the data that we're looking for,

2270
02:00:30,221 --> 02:00:32,800
where the mothers in construction
in that side of the building,

2271
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:35,280
I think at,
at the very least,

2272
02:00:35,310 --> 02:00:40,310
they knew exactly what was coming and
they helped make it happen at the very

2273
02:00:40,801 --> 02:00:43,770
fucking lease, which should piss
people off just as fucking match.

2274
02:00:43,771 --> 02:00:46,220
Because think about it, if they knew
that this terrorist attack was coming,

2275
02:00:46,230 --> 02:00:50,430
so they tell people in the first World
Trade Center, whatever the, the, you know,

2276
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:51,660
after the first ones hit,

2277
02:00:51,661 --> 02:00:54,210
they knew that it was the terrorist
attack that they had been warned about.

2278
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:57,090
And then they told people to go to
fucking back to work in the Second World

2279
02:00:57,091 --> 02:00:57,760
Trade Center

2280
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:59,540
hang.
It piqued my interest when I was here.

2281
02:00:59,630 --> 02:01:04,340
A lot of thing like theories about
that was the building seven. Yeah.

2282
02:01:04,740 --> 02:01:06,940
That was like the videos
of that or just it?

2283
02:01:07,070 --> 02:01:10,190
It looks exactly like if you put it
right next to a video of of an an

2284
02:01:10,191 --> 02:01:13,070
intentionally imploded building.
Like it just looks exactly the same.

2285
02:01:13,740 --> 02:01:15,510
Yeah. The, the tower seven,

2286
02:01:15,511 --> 02:01:20,511
this mind fuck of a half because the real
thing about tower seven as if it was a

2287
02:01:20,821 --> 02:01:24,060
controlled demolition.
What did they build it that way?

2288
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:26,850
Did they build it so they could
just implode it and if they didn't,

2289
02:01:26,851 --> 02:01:28,050
how long did it take to rig that?

2290
02:01:28,170 --> 02:01:30,930
Cause you talked to people that
like demolish buildings. That's you.

2291
02:01:30,931 --> 02:01:34,320
It takes a long time. And if it
didn't, if it wasn't a demolition,

2292
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:37,320
why would you not sue like crazy.

2293
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:40,070
If that was my building and
it just fell apart like that

2294
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:43,160
and I'd be like, bitch, how'd you build
this? Is Larry Silverstein confident?

2295
02:01:43,161 --> 02:01:45,070
He has like 20 mil dude off

2296
02:01:45,150 --> 02:01:47,980
off the whole complex roofers.
Yeah. Guys. The truth.

2297
02:01:48,790 --> 02:01:52,080
I find it so scary that that's the
word that's been pushed out there.

2298
02:01:52,110 --> 02:01:54,400
Now it's being pushed on totally different
topics that have nothing to do with

2299
02:01:54,401 --> 02:01:56,650
nine 11 like it's kind of where William,

2300
02:01:56,651 --> 02:01:59,680
that a truth or is now a piece of
shit like somebody who's interested in

2301
02:01:59,681 --> 02:02:04,681
pursuing what the truth was about nine
11 that's like truth or the one patriotic

2302
02:02:05,220 --> 02:02:07,680
cruisers and it's like
a funny being a truth.

2303
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:11,290
It's almost like straight out of 1984
these fucking unpatriotic true thirst.

2304
02:02:11,310 --> 02:02:14,220
They want the truth. Well, how
about being a liberal? Yeah, I,

2305
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:16,900
I've been called libertarian
like it's an insult before,

2306
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:19,120
which I'm not even a libertarian.
I have some of their views,

2307
02:02:19,121 --> 02:02:20,800
but it's like you really,

2308
02:02:20,801 --> 02:02:24,370
you hate people who want to have
more personal freedoms and liberties.

2309
02:02:24,371 --> 02:02:28,340
That's a bad thing. Why is
that a bad thing? It's, it's
weird. It's crazy. We're,

2310
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:31,780
we're nuts. Oh, you one of those love

2311
02:02:33,930 --> 02:02:37,900
fucking up his world. What are you a
friend, your friend going to be my friend.

2312
02:02:38,010 --> 02:02:42,670
Found out my friend. Fuck face. I
don't want friends from American. Well.

2313
02:02:42,671 --> 02:02:46,810
Also, another interesting thing about
the nine 11 thing is that if we,

2314
02:02:47,010 --> 02:02:51,640
the s there was a CIA sting operation
to get the Bin Ladin Confession tape,

2315
02:02:51,790 --> 02:02:54,460
quote Unquote Confession tape
that's admitted by the Guardian,

2316
02:02:54,461 --> 02:02:57,640
like that was set up by the CIA to
get him to supposedly confessed.

2317
02:02:57,641 --> 02:03:00,730
So if we had him, why didn't we just
arrest him then? That was in 2001 well,

2318
02:03:00,731 --> 02:03:03,120
what do you think about this
guy who wrote the book and the,

2319
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:07,810
the Navy seal wrote the
book on the assassination of
Bin Ladin and he's given a

2320
02:03:07,811 --> 02:03:10,750
totally different version of the
events than the official story.

2321
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:14,530
How does that guy, you're allowed to make
that book. How can we have an ice dam?

2322
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:18,030
I don't, I don't know if I
believe cause I mean I'm not sure.

2323
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:22,390
I think they realize that the public
knows that, um, you know, they're,

2324
02:03:22,540 --> 02:03:24,690
the official story is
never exactly correct,

2325
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:26,760
but you're allowed to say this.

2326
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:29,430
What was the last time a guy was
involved in like a secret operation?

2327
02:03:29,431 --> 02:03:34,410
Wrote a book about it. It doesn't make
any sense. Yeah. It's almost like you're,

2328
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:38,520
they give him the green. I don't
under they give him the green light.

2329
02:03:38,521 --> 02:03:40,590
Did they tell him, listen man,
you want to do help? You crunchy.

2330
02:03:40,591 --> 02:03:43,510
I like to write a book about the events.
Just mix it up a little.

2331
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:47,310
It looks like we're like not telling
the full truth and we're like,

2332
02:03:49,290 --> 02:03:53,130
bring it back.
Don't say anything.

2333
02:03:53,131 --> 02:03:57,990
When in season five we bring back
the sound wasn't really Osama,

2334
02:03:57,991 --> 02:04:01,540
it was this other dude that looks like
Osama because he's in love with Osama,

2335
02:04:01,590 --> 02:04:03,360
you know he wants to
be Osama but he's not.

2336
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:06,300
So they shot him in the heads of it even
know so they thought they got Osama.

2337
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:11,040
They really did think that got him.
We've been holding back on the DNA.

2338
02:04:11,041 --> 02:04:14,610
We've had the DNA. We've kept it secret
because they didn't want to alarm people

2339
02:04:17,130 --> 02:04:20,630
still out there. He was on the
island. I love that you NGA,

2340
02:04:20,690 --> 02:04:23,310
when [inaudible] speaks every year,
everyone like walks out,

2341
02:04:23,311 --> 02:04:25,800
but he's actually said some
really same shit. He's just like,

2342
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:28,170
how come you guys just dump and
laudens body in the ocean? Like,

2343
02:04:28,171 --> 02:04:31,130
how come you didn't just arrest
him and put him on trial? They can,

2344
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:32,380
everyone's like walking out like,

2345
02:04:32,550 --> 02:04:35,220
because he like the real life version
of the dictator, like a document.

2346
02:04:36,610 --> 02:04:39,450
But it gives the UN speech
there and people are like, no.

2347
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:42,510
Most people that are in the
intelligence community said that,

2348
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:45,130
that he was already dead. They said been
a lot of that had been dead for years.

2349
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:48,780
Our butoh came out and Pakistani prime
minister, he for, she was assassinated,

2350
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:52,000
can't you said to see attended
his funeral to ease those Grice.

2351
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,620
She said she attended his funeral. Hmm.
This bitch. Cause we get problematic.

2352
02:04:57,870 --> 02:05:02,870
Pesky truth. Predator, pesky
traffic or ground. Never say it.

2353
02:05:02,871 --> 02:05:07,710
Common like Predator and like a second,
a third vote.

2354
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:10,710
I don't even think they vote on it.

2355
02:05:11,320 --> 02:05:14,250
This thing about all this is that no
one demands evidence or no one demands

2356
02:05:14,251 --> 02:05:16,740
facts from the government. So that's just
appeal to authority. You're just like,

2357
02:05:16,741 --> 02:05:19,230
well, let's just trust our
government must be true.

2358
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:21,360
It's not no one because there's
people like you right now,

2359
02:05:21,390 --> 02:05:24,900
there's a whole wave of kids
that are growing up that are um,

2360
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:30,360
people growing up with real transparency
as far as what's going on. You know,

2361
02:05:30,361 --> 02:05:34,260
and even if you want to insulate yourself
Salou give yourselves a pat on the

2362
02:05:34,261 --> 02:05:39,100
back of your, yeah,
yeah. It's fucking nasty.

2363
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:43,020
Horrible started.
Sorry Dave Asprey.

2364
02:05:43,021 --> 02:05:45,360
I didn't have time to make the
bulletproof coffee that I use.

2365
02:05:45,361 --> 02:05:48,180
I can't believe it's not butter. It's
not the same point. Nice coffee. No,

2366
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:51,300
you just pour it in there.
We had this guy on yesterday who makes a,

2367
02:05:51,330 --> 02:05:55,920
he's a fucking super cool dude and
just incredibly fascinating guy.

2368
02:05:55,921 --> 02:05:59,010
And one of the things he was saying was
that we have in an amazing amount of

2369
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:03,950
toxins that we just accept because
there's so much corn in our diets and like

2370
02:06:03,951 --> 02:06:04,290
some,

2371
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:09,290
some insane number of percentage of corn
has like certain low level toxic fungus

2372
02:06:10,021 --> 02:06:12,000
on it.
Totally edible.

2373
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:16,440
I pissed off how you drink a lot of
water that's actually healthy, but that,

2374
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:17,341
that you know,

2375
02:06:17,341 --> 02:06:21,750
you should really have only grass fed
beef and only grass fed beef butter.

2376
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:26,640
And that coffee off oftentimes
comes with a fungus on it as well.

2377
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:29,610
And there's toxic funguses and a
lot of people's coffee and that.

2378
02:06:29,611 --> 02:06:30,690
They're literally,
that's why they get,

2379
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:34,340
they feel like shit after they drink
coffee. Literally you're getting poisoned.

2380
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:37,020
It's not this club, this is all organic.
We'd go, we'd go to a nice place.

2381
02:06:37,470 --> 02:06:40,830
It's down the street. It's very
nice people. Um, but that, um,

2382
02:06:40,860 --> 02:06:45,090
he makes his bulletproof coffee so
he takes his butter and MCT oil.

2383
02:06:45,091 --> 02:06:46,170
Mct Oil is,

2384
02:06:46,171 --> 02:06:49,200
you take coconut oil and he's sticking
in a centrifuge and take the best part of

2385
02:06:49,201 --> 02:06:53,130
it, the most nutritious part. And then he
puts it, separates it and makes an oil,

2386
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:57,870
puts that in the coffee butter.
That's from a only grass fed cows.

2387
02:06:57,900 --> 02:06:59,510
Cause apparently the,
the um,

2388
02:06:59,550 --> 02:07:01,620
the fats in that are much
more healthy for your body.

2389
02:07:02,070 --> 02:07:07,070
And he mixes it all together in a blender
with his coffee and he just sits back

2390
02:07:07,411 --> 02:07:11,940
and shot himself in the head. Fucking
guy was a trip, man, that guy,

2391
02:07:12,270 --> 02:07:15,010
there's very few people that really
freaked me out. This guy freaked me out.

2392
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:19,050
What was the whole point of drinking
that that's sensational for your body?

2393
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:23,010
All the, uh, the, the fatty
acids, all the, the, uh, the oils,

2394
02:07:23,011 --> 02:07:26,610
the healthy oils from the MCT oil
and from the grass fed butter.

2395
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:30,030
So sensational for brain function.
You're, you just feel like you're on fire.

2396
02:07:30,031 --> 02:07:32,850
It's like really great stuff and get
it doesn't like burn you out as easy

2397
02:07:32,851 --> 02:07:35,950
because I don't understand.
He explained how it's uh,

2398
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:39,640
how they interact with each other and
how, how positive it is for your, uh,

2399
02:07:40,030 --> 02:07:41,870
for your brain.
But he had a,

2400
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:45,940
all these crazy things that he did and
one of them was go to this place that,

2401
02:07:45,941 --> 02:07:48,970
that thing with the sound where you
manipulate sound with your mind.

2402
02:07:48,971 --> 02:07:52,600
You're set up with electrodes and you
literally manipulate sounds with thought

2403
02:07:52,601 --> 02:07:53,490
and in, in, in,

2404
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:57,760
in which your mind and brainwaves and
you're in an isolated place where it's

2405
02:07:57,761 --> 02:08:01,690
total blackness and you're doing this
and apparently it's been shown to rewire

2406
02:08:01,691 --> 02:08:05,140
your brain and the more control
over you have over the sound.

2407
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:09,340
It's like power lifting for your brain
and you come out of it with a permanent

2408
02:08:09,341 --> 02:08:13,900
boost in your Iq. He boosted his
Iq 20 points from this seven day,

2409
02:08:14,130 --> 02:08:16,960
every day,
all day experience of this Guy Magneto.

2410
02:08:17,010 --> 02:08:21,430
Sounds like maybe that's what I'm talking
about. Fuck out. And you walk in there.

2411
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:25,320
Well listen, the guy was smart as fuck.
He wasn't fake smart as fuck. So I,

2412
02:08:25,330 --> 02:08:27,490
I had to like listen
to everything he said.

2413
02:08:27,491 --> 02:08:32,491
And I know that research and science
backs almost every single different aspect

2414
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:36,610
of that. The health part of his
bulletproof diet that he's talking about.

2415
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:41,200
I read all the stuff. I mean it's, it's
all, it seems like it seems rock solid.

2416
02:08:41,620 --> 02:08:45,280
So this guy is like this super genius
character who is claiming that 20% or

2417
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:49,540
rather a 20 points of his Iq was boosted
by doing this fucking crazy sound

2418
02:08:49,541 --> 02:08:52,570
experiment and the dark for seven days.
He scared the shit out of me.

2419
02:08:52,630 --> 02:08:56,410
Where did he claim where, where do you
do this? BC. That's where he lives.

2420
02:08:56,470 --> 02:08:57,251
He lives up in BC.

2421
02:08:57,251 --> 02:09:00,760
And he did he sent this up or is it like
a research project someone was doing or

2422
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:05,440
oh no, well it's, it's, you know,
I don't, I don't remember entirely,

2423
02:09:05,441 --> 02:09:09,040
but it's based on the research of
some neuroscientists to figure it out.

2424
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:14,040
Something about manipulating brainwaves
with electricity and stimulation.

2425
02:09:14,171 --> 02:09:17,980
So he puts these little electrodes on
his head and he sends like a low volt to

2426
02:09:17,981 --> 02:09:22,480
change his, uh, his state, you know, from
Alpha to Beta or whatever the fuck it is.

2427
02:09:22,490 --> 02:09:24,460
You know, he's got like, you know,

2428
02:09:24,490 --> 02:09:27,550
like different settings on
it and I put it on pinched.

2429
02:09:27,820 --> 02:09:28,930
I said that it felt like a,

2430
02:09:28,931 --> 02:09:33,931
like a a B was just touching you at the
tip of his horn is a little stinger,

2431
02:09:34,421 --> 02:09:38,620
just not stinging you but
just say [inaudible] could
just fuck you up right now

2432
02:09:38,630 --> 02:09:40,390
dude,
but not quite.

2433
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:43,810
And so this guy is obsessed with,

2434
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:46,720
with like manipulating his
mind and like hacking his body.

2435
02:09:46,721 --> 02:09:50,500
So he takes in all of these incredible
amounts of essential nutrients and he's

2436
02:09:50,501 --> 02:09:53,800
eating like the healthiest grass fed
meat and he's fucking electrifying his

2437
02:09:53,801 --> 02:09:56,380
brain and he's going to his place in
manipulating things with sound and getting

2438
02:09:56,381 --> 02:10:00,010
smarter, like notably visibly smarter.
And I know he's smart as fuck.

2439
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:03,410
He can't fake it for two hours. There's
a certain amount of talking to someone.

2440
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:05,050
We can tell if someone's we like,

2441
02:10:05,051 --> 02:10:08,230
I've had people on the podcast before
that I knew were full of Shit within like

2442
02:10:08,231 --> 02:10:09,700
the first 20 minutes talking to them.

2443
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:12,370
But the first 15 minutes I might've
thought they were pretty cool.

2444
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:15,340
And then somewhere along the line to go,
there's this guy's a little wacky,

2445
02:10:15,341 --> 02:10:18,220
there's something, something,
something wrong here. There's some,

2446
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:19,360
this guy was not like that.

2447
02:10:19,361 --> 02:10:23,380
This guy was just firing off all
this fucking information about how to

2448
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:25,210
streamline your,
your,

2449
02:10:25,211 --> 02:10:28,510
your mind and how to make things work
better and what nutrients are essential

2450
02:10:28,511 --> 02:10:32,650
and what they do and how it literally,
it enhances the way your nerve endings,

2451
02:10:32,710 --> 02:10:33,980
your nerve endings

2452
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:38,690
interact. He eats Yak. Yak was
delicious. It was delicious,

2453
02:10:38,691 --> 02:10:42,650
but they only eat a certain type of a
plant and you can't even grow it at low

2454
02:10:42,651 --> 02:10:46,250
altitudes so they don't like live down
here. It's like tough to get a Yak,

2455
02:10:46,980 --> 02:10:50,390
Yak in your backyard because you grow
Yak food. It just fucking just dies.

2456
02:10:51,210 --> 02:10:54,620
Idiot to who? Collect
exotic pets. I was just,

2457
02:10:54,900 --> 02:10:57,980
we were just talking about it outside
all the idiot too. I would like python,

2458
02:10:57,981 --> 02:11:02,981
fucking chimpanzees and Kangaroos and
there's like beauty pageants for exotic

2459
02:11:03,201 --> 02:11:08,060
animals. Didn't know what a chimpanzee
was until that one eight that lady's face.

2460
02:11:08,270 --> 02:11:11,330
People thought the chimpanzees were
like Bj and the bear, you know,

2461
02:11:11,331 --> 02:11:13,440
like to see your buddy. He goes
trucking with you. You know,

2462
02:11:13,460 --> 02:11:15,530
like they were always sidekicks
and movies and shit. Like,

2463
02:11:15,710 --> 02:11:19,490
people didn't see the videos of
chimps eating monkeys alive. You know,

2464
02:11:19,491 --> 02:11:23,210
they've never seen a champ attack a
person they didn't know about these chimps

2465
02:11:23,211 --> 02:11:24,730
in Africa right now that are going to,

2466
02:11:24,731 --> 02:11:28,130
that forget one particular part or Africa
where they're actually going actively

2467
02:11:28,131 --> 02:11:31,280
out of their way to kill humans
and they've killed, uh, you know,

2468
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:33,590
I've got to pull that up because
that sounds like terrorism.

2469
02:11:33,591 --> 02:11:37,520
I think we should go and start a war.
That's exactly what we're doing to them.

2470
02:11:37,870 --> 02:11:42,390
So that's a shock to
they're doing it back.

2471
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:46,400
Well, the row there, um, there
were reacting. It's in a Congo,

2472
02:11:46,580 --> 02:11:49,130
the eat them like crazy in the Congo.
It's called Bushmeat.

2473
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:52,190
The lions in Africa that
were intentionally hunting
humans and like keeping

2474
02:11:52,191 --> 02:11:55,190
their bones in a cave or oh yeah.
That was the ghost and the darkness.

2475
02:11:56,190 --> 02:12:01,090
That's pretty big. Back when val
Kilmer was sexy and slim for Batman.

2476
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:05,590
Yeah, back man. I just fucking
tapped out. And it's like, yeah,

2477
02:12:06,050 --> 02:12:09,680
imagine that this thing,
Congo chimps reporting and killing people.

2478
02:12:10,730 --> 02:12:15,290
Imagine that thing. And here's the thing
is they go right for your fingers first.

2479
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:17,300
That's what they like to rip apart first.

2480
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:19,550
Cause they know you can't fight
back when you don't have fingers.

2481
02:12:19,551 --> 02:12:21,110
So they immediately go after your fingers,

2482
02:12:21,111 --> 02:12:24,620
like grabbed your hand and eat your
fucking fingers and you can't stop them.

2483
02:12:24,910 --> 02:12:27,020
You can't stop them. They're way
stronger than you. They have your hand,

2484
02:12:27,021 --> 02:12:28,430
they're just going to chew
your fucking fingers off.

2485
02:12:28,431 --> 02:12:30,620
And then they go after your Dick.
They go off to your Dick,

2486
02:12:30,621 --> 02:12:34,250
they rip your Dick off, they
kill your sexually, and then
they go after your face.

2487
02:12:34,251 --> 02:12:36,290
They pull your eyes
out like they're smart.

2488
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:39,740
They know they're not even killing you.
They kill you easy.

2489
02:12:39,741 --> 02:12:42,380
They could pick up a rock and just
start smashing you and you'd be dead.

2490
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:46,100
But they're punishing you.
They are punishing, punishing
you by taking away your,

2491
02:12:46,101 --> 02:12:49,670
your humanness, taking one of your ability
to see things, your sex organs. I mean,

2492
02:12:49,671 --> 02:12:54,470
it's crazy. They take your feet apart.
They attack people's feet. Yeah.

2493
02:12:55,170 --> 02:12:59,480
And they're smart. You know,
they can spell, you know,
they shouldn't be in cages.

2494
02:12:59,510 --> 02:13:00,071
I mean there's,
there's,

2495
02:13:00,071 --> 02:13:03,830
there's no way there should be a healthy
separation between people and these

2496
02:13:03,831 --> 02:13:06,410
fucking things in the real world
because they do that to each other.

2497
02:13:06,411 --> 02:13:08,630
They go after other chimps and
they fucked him up. I mean,

2498
02:13:08,631 --> 02:13:11,450
it's amazing that they're just
now starting to gang up on people.

2499
02:13:11,870 --> 02:13:13,430
But 10 people have been killed.

2500
02:13:13,431 --> 02:13:17,380
17 people have been severely
injured and uh, they,

2501
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:20,840
they killed one little kid.
They don't give a fuck. Why
would they not kill a kid?

2502
02:13:20,870 --> 02:13:23,120
They don't like people that don't
like people. They don't like to say,

2503
02:13:23,121 --> 02:13:25,670
well it's only been like six.
I just want to let them,

2504
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:29,360
they think this is an easy kill.
Yeah. It's just scary shit man.

2505
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,010
I was listening to one of your,
where you're talking to

2506
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:34,100
a guy who came back from China,
is it,

2507
02:13:34,110 --> 02:13:36,000
they love to eat and monkeys
and certain parts of China.

2508
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:39,750
So it's really not that much different
from what we do in terms of other

2509
02:13:39,751 --> 02:13:41,130
cultures of humans.

2510
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:43,950
Like I think it's appalling that somebody
would hunt down a monkey and fucking

2511
02:13:43,951 --> 02:13:45,540
eat it.
Just not even cause you need the meat.

2512
02:13:45,541 --> 02:13:48,420
But just for pleasure because
it's considered like a
high status thing to have

2513
02:13:48,430 --> 02:13:50,870
monkey on the table,
you know? That is weird.

2514
02:13:50,871 --> 02:13:55,050
More fucked up to do that or more fucked
up to have drones that shoot rockets

2515
02:13:55,051 --> 02:13:59,820
into buildings and you know you're going
to get like 98% I think drones are,

2516
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:02,280
drones are a little more fucked up.
Yeah.

2517
02:14:02,281 --> 02:14:06,460
What is the percentage is 2%
versus 98% fuck up, right?

2518
02:14:06,670 --> 02:14:08,700
Many percent accidental murder.

2519
02:14:09,190 --> 02:14:11,680
That's what we're getting for all
those buildings to fight terror.

2520
02:14:12,330 --> 02:14:15,390
That's the only way. That's the only
way I'm going to bust some myths.

2521
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:16,660
That right there isn't it?

2522
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:20,110
So you have these two combating
narratives with like the liberal and

2523
02:14:20,330 --> 02:14:21,900
conservative establishment
where you're like,

2524
02:14:21,901 --> 02:14:24,810
we either have to have full fledged
warfare or we have drone wars,

2525
02:14:24,811 --> 02:14:28,080
but no one's questioning do we need,
maybe we don't need any.

2526
02:14:28,450 --> 02:14:31,890
I'm showing you to be fucking fighting
this proverbial enemy that doesn't really,

2527
02:14:31,950 --> 02:14:34,570
it's not a very central way cooler
we can do with that technology. Yeah.

2528
02:14:34,710 --> 02:14:35,470
Well we can,

2529
02:14:35,470 --> 02:14:38,820
the amount of money we spent in Iraq
and Afghanistan would have funded like a

2530
02:14:38,821 --> 02:14:41,310
little over 400 missions.
Uh,

2531
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:44,610
the same size and significance
is the curiosity mission to Mars.

2532
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:47,910
I did the math on that and uh,
I get the math.

2533
02:14:47,970 --> 02:14:51,180
Well that was the Neil degrasse Tyson
isn't that fucking psycho though.

2534
02:14:51,181 --> 02:14:53,010
Like the money that we spent
in Iraq and Afghanistan,

2535
02:14:53,011 --> 02:14:55,710
which the average American citizen
is received zero benefit from,

2536
02:14:55,860 --> 02:15:00,030
we could have launched 400 missions
around the solar system and it killed a

2537
02:15:00,030 --> 02:15:02,100
million people aside from the Shit
we learned from doing all that.

2538
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:03,090
It's the jobs that we would,

2539
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:06,210
we would create right here in the u s
cause you don't outsource NASA jobs to

2540
02:15:06,211 --> 02:15:10,560
China. They stay here in the
u s it's crazy. Yeah. It's,
it's interesting that this,

2541
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:14,850
this industry is thought of as like by
the people that are in charge I guess as

2542
02:15:14,851 --> 02:15:18,270
the only way of having this
amount of business going on.

2543
02:15:18,630 --> 02:15:20,190
It's like that's the only way.

2544
02:15:20,220 --> 02:15:24,270
Instead of thinking of taking the same
sort of initiative at the same amount of

2545
02:15:24,271 --> 02:15:28,140
focus and resources and putting it
on just building up inner cities,

2546
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:31,170
just fixing Detroit. You know, if
you've seen the signs and Detroit,

2547
02:15:31,171 --> 02:15:33,390
now they're saying enter
Detroit at your own risk.

2548
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:36,990
It's like they're posting siren sang
in terrible places saying people should

2549
02:15:36,991 --> 02:15:38,880
enter it. Their own risk.
It's like saying like,

2550
02:15:38,881 --> 02:15:40,500
I guess cops aren't going to go in there.

2551
02:15:40,770 --> 02:15:42,900
Like the murder rate in
Detroit is through the roof.

2552
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:44,680
It's the scariest place in the country.
Right.

2553
02:15:44,681 --> 02:15:48,240
In the city council there was telling
people not to come like, yeah, I,

2554
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:50,280
which is like weird cause you,
you know crazy.

2555
02:15:50,580 --> 02:15:53,400
It's good for their economy to have people
come in and it's for them to say that

2556
02:15:53,401 --> 02:15:54,470
it's gotta be really serious.
Yeah.

2557
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:59,070
The fact that we're over in Afghanistan
and we're not in Detroit. I was crazy,

2558
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:02,520
awesome campaigns looking at the
cops don't want to go into Detroit.

2559
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:03,900
You should look,

2560
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:08,010
there's no way a country can
be strong when the base of it,

2561
02:16:08,011 --> 02:16:11,910
the bottom of it is fucked up and
rotten and the bottom of this country,

2562
02:16:11,911 --> 02:16:15,780
the foundation of this country
is youth and poor neighborhoods.

2563
02:16:15,810 --> 02:16:19,560
Though the higher we can make the
quality of life for our poor people,

2564
02:16:19,740 --> 02:16:21,630
the better the whole thing works.

2565
02:16:21,631 --> 02:16:26,010
The more accessible like happiness
and wealth is to poor people,

2566
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:29,980
the more it's possible to, to, to gain
and achieve and to get out of there. The,

2567
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,300
the,
the stronger.

2568
02:16:31,301 --> 02:16:35,440
The whole thing gets like the idea that
we have this finite amount of jobs. No,

2569
02:16:35,441 --> 02:16:38,590
we just have a finite amount of jobs
with this system, with this system,

2570
02:16:38,591 --> 02:16:40,180
but there's obviously a
lot of work to be done.

2571
02:16:40,210 --> 02:16:42,880
There's a shit load of things that need
to get done and not everybody's going to

2572
02:16:42,881 --> 02:16:43,870
get to be Tom Cruise,

2573
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:47,800
but a lot of people do a lot of really
good fucking things that it is possible

2574
02:16:47,830 --> 02:16:49,510
that we could use the same resources,

2575
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:52,930
the same billions of dollars that we're
allocating to going over places that we

2576
02:16:52,931 --> 02:16:56,140
don't really understand for
whatever fucking reason. You
know, it's not the truth.

2577
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:59,890
We could do that over here.
It doesn't seem to be impossible.

2578
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:03,130
It just doesn't seem to be probable
under this situation. And this,

2579
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:06,580
the group that's in charge right now
has such a stranglehold that they don't

2580
02:17:06,581 --> 02:17:10,060
want to ever make. You think that it's
possible to do things any differently.

2581
02:17:10,270 --> 02:17:12,040
Like we're always going
to be at war with Iran.

2582
02:17:12,220 --> 02:17:15,040
We're never going to totally trust Russia.
China is always dangerous.

2583
02:17:15,050 --> 02:17:16,150
We don't know what they're really saying.

2584
02:17:16,210 --> 02:17:18,700
I think China really is dangerous
though, just my opinion. But yeah,

2585
02:17:18,810 --> 02:17:22,950
I think based on what I've seen, they have
no respect for human rights. No. And uh,

2586
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:26,040
they're growing at such a rate that they
have to keep their middleclass happy

2587
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:27,990
and that's not going to happen forever.
I mean,

2588
02:17:28,050 --> 02:17:30,360
already it's started seeing
signs of a slow down,

2589
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:33,450
like a credit crunch and a slow down.
You're going to get desperate. Exactly.

2590
02:17:33,940 --> 02:17:34,070
I mean,

2591
02:17:34,070 --> 02:17:36,710
there's only so many resources in the
world and so much wealth and they need

2592
02:17:36,711 --> 02:17:38,990
more of it to keep their middle
class from attacking them basically.

2593
02:17:39,070 --> 02:17:43,190
Have they had a policy of,
of attacking other countries in the past.

2594
02:17:43,670 --> 02:17:44,840
Have they worked on that?

2595
02:17:45,890 --> 02:17:49,550
A billion people and they want more and
more and they try to do things to stop

2596
02:17:49,551 --> 02:17:52,070
people from not saying
day like just the Chinese.

2597
02:17:52,071 --> 02:17:55,550
I'm saying you get any country with a
billion people that has just recently come

2598
02:17:55,551 --> 02:17:59,360
online and the capitalism game we're
having more shit is what you want to do.

2599
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:02,900
They're going to start to acquire other
areas. Doesn't India have a billion too?

2600
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:05,090
They do.
They just make Bollywood.

2601
02:18:05,091 --> 02:18:08,690
They just make movies
and they don't eat cows.

2602
02:18:09,870 --> 02:18:12,500
They don't, they're not
threatening anybody other than
the Pakistan though. Right.

2603
02:18:13,910 --> 02:18:16,820
It's also hilarious
about hearing how Iran,

2604
02:18:17,130 --> 02:18:18,960
when they get their
nuclear weapon or whatever,

2605
02:18:18,961 --> 02:18:21,840
that people are fearmongering
us about. Um, they're like,

2606
02:18:21,841 --> 02:18:23,850
they're going to start a nuclear
arms race in the Middle East,

2607
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:27,670
but they don't talk about Israel.
Pakistan, fucking, I mean,

2608
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:32,530
so many countries that have
nuclear stockpile. Funny.
Like Pakistan is sort of,

2609
02:18:32,531 --> 02:18:34,050
it was sort of a u s backed country.

2610
02:18:34,051 --> 02:18:36,840
There's a lot of us money going
in there over the last 60 years.

2611
02:18:36,870 --> 02:18:41,870
And India was sort of had the same
thing going on with Russia and you know,

2612
02:18:43,050 --> 02:18:48,050
Usr Ussr collapsed and yet India is a new
emerging country and Pakistan is doing

2613
02:18:48,811 --> 02:18:49,500
so shitty.

2614
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:51,750
It's hilarious that we pay attention
to them like they're really dangerous.

2615
02:18:51,751 --> 02:18:55,190
Well we don't fuck with North Korea.
North Korea is scary there.

2616
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:56,580
They are really brainwashed.

2617
02:18:56,610 --> 02:18:59,580
It's a nutty fucking country full
of people that will drop bombs.

2618
02:18:59,610 --> 02:19:01,270
It's depressing to the human costs.
They're like,

2619
02:19:01,380 --> 02:19:04,680
those people are 100%
brainwashed. Yeah. They brought,

2620
02:19:04,860 --> 02:19:08,940
they brought in an eye doctor, uh,
to fix some of the people's eyes

2621
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:11,870
cause they had cataracts do whatever they
do for cataracts and chopped that part

2622
02:19:11,871 --> 02:19:13,940
out and replace it.
And they did this,

2623
02:19:14,360 --> 02:19:17,270
they actually brought in a film crew
and this was like the cover story.

2624
02:19:17,271 --> 02:19:19,700
They had to bring them into the countries
that are just filming the medical

2625
02:19:19,701 --> 02:19:22,620
procedures and it's scary.
They,

2626
02:19:22,830 --> 02:19:25,790
they would get their vision back instead
of back to the d instead of thanking

2627
02:19:25,791 --> 02:19:28,220
the doctor like you
dear leader for bringing

2628
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:31,010
us our vision back. And it's like,
no, he didn't bring your vision back.

2629
02:19:31,011 --> 02:19:33,150
He's the reason why you have fucking
cataracts in the first place because you

2630
02:19:33,151 --> 02:19:34,340
working in a factory your whole life,

2631
02:19:34,420 --> 02:19:36,860
like dark lighting and chemicals
being sprayed in your face.

2632
02:19:36,890 --> 02:19:39,980
Did you see all the people that were
crying in the street when he died and that

2633
02:19:39,981 --> 02:19:41,210
people who weren't crying,

2634
02:19:41,211 --> 02:19:45,290
where actually there were locked in jail
for six months and punished and they

2635
02:19:45,291 --> 02:19:49,190
lost jobs and like they have
concentration camps. I mean,

2636
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:52,690
you'd go there to work and die. Yeah, but
they don't have resources, so fuck them.

2637
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,380
You know,
if they had oil,

2638
02:19:54,381 --> 02:19:57,860
we would have an awesome movie
about going to war with North Korea.

2639
02:19:57,920 --> 02:19:59,900
It's already know it would
be the big deal. Yeah.

2640
02:19:59,990 --> 02:20:03,770
But there's nothing there for us.
It's not worth it. It's not in there.

2641
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:06,710
I saw some stats on
Twitter. It was like, uh,

2642
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:10,040
can somebody please tell congress
that there's no oil on the Internet

2643
02:20:12,810 --> 02:20:17,400
tweeted that? That's hilarious. So the,

2644
02:20:17,470 --> 02:20:18,020
you know,

2645
02:20:18,020 --> 02:20:21,980
the only hope that I have for any of
this stuff actually turning around is I

2646
02:20:21,981 --> 02:20:25,400
think the people that have
been in power for a long time.

2647
02:20:25,430 --> 02:20:27,530
We got to keep eternal life from them.

2648
02:20:27,820 --> 02:20:31,220
We've got to make sure that they don't
actually get some sort of technology

2649
02:20:31,221 --> 02:20:32,860
where they could live forever
because then I'll never,

2650
02:20:32,930 --> 02:20:35,540
it's like there's so much
power in that position.

2651
02:20:35,541 --> 02:20:38,540
There's so much power in the position
of being in charge of the military

2652
02:20:38,541 --> 02:20:42,680
industrial complex being in charge of,
you know, where the money gets allocated,

2653
02:20:42,681 --> 02:20:45,220
being in charge of the influence
of presidents that, that,

2654
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:48,330
that to get to that position.
I mean that is a,

2655
02:20:48,331 --> 02:20:53,331
an immense point of power and it's really
hard to wrench power when someone has

2656
02:20:54,801 --> 02:20:58,910
that and it's even harder to get them
to give it up because it's not moral.

2657
02:20:59,570 --> 02:21:03,980
And that seems to be the only way you're
ever really going to change things is

2658
02:21:03,981 --> 02:21:07,490
they have to leave. They have to
die off. And people like yourself,

2659
02:21:07,940 --> 02:21:10,220
young people that want to
get involved in politics,

2660
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:15,400
have to move into these previously
corrupt roles and announced new standards.

2661
02:21:16,130 --> 02:21:20,930
They have to move in and announce a new
way of looking at things that people

2662
02:21:20,931 --> 02:21:24,080
thought we were getting with Obama.
That's what we were happy about.

2663
02:21:24,081 --> 02:21:28,790
We thought we were getting out of this
same fucking scary shit that we had with

2664
02:21:28,791 --> 02:21:30,350
this,
this corporate monster,

2665
02:21:30,351 --> 02:21:33,290
Dick Cheney pulling the strings
of this dumb dumb from Texas.

2666
02:21:33,291 --> 02:21:36,170
And we were terrified and we were like,
this guy does not represent us,

2667
02:21:36,410 --> 02:21:39,170
but that guy does look at him.
He's half black. It's a single mom.

2668
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:42,770
He said came from single mom, used
to smoke weed, get 'em in all my God,

2669
02:21:42,771 --> 02:21:43,760
it's going to be the shit.

2670
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:47,320
Meanwhile recruited Taz already
taken over and I think that uh,

2671
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:50,690
it's just a matter of understanding
that and undermining the whole system.

2672
02:21:50,691 --> 02:21:54,170
We can't just wait for people to take
over these positions and then change it

2673
02:21:54,171 --> 02:21:56,240
from the top down.
That could never have got to fight.

2674
02:21:56,690 --> 02:21:59,460
You gotta fight both parties.
You can't just go after one or the other.

2675
02:21:59,490 --> 02:22:03,650
Put it in the system is
broken. Yeah. There's no system
that says no dude parties.

2676
02:22:03,651 --> 02:22:06,620
I mean, shit, it's all completely
shows like this are helping.

2677
02:22:06,621 --> 02:22:08,360
Like it's not just the
system we need to fix.

2678
02:22:08,361 --> 02:22:09,830
It's also people need to become aware.

2679
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:12,650
There are a lot of people don't even
know this shit is happening right now.

2680
02:22:12,651 --> 02:22:14,900
They think that they still have a
government that kind of represents them.

2681
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:15,471
By the way,

2682
02:22:15,471 --> 02:22:18,830
this is good for the government
too because unchecked
power is bad for you too.

2683
02:22:19,070 --> 02:22:21,890
You don't want to be in that position.
You should be checked. You should.

2684
02:22:21,891 --> 02:22:25,620
There should be regulations. It should
be there should be sale, but should be

2685
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:29,790
safeguards in place to
protect you from human nature.

2686
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:35,000
It should be very clean and very clear
and since we're moving into this age of

2687
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:38,400
more access to information
than ever before,

2688
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:42,000
it should be easier to check you than
ever before. You should be more noble.

2689
02:22:42,001 --> 02:22:45,360
You should be more just, it should be
more fair. It shouldn't be the opposite.

2690
02:22:45,510 --> 02:22:47,580
Shouldn't be more surveillance,

2691
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:50,610
more storing of your fucking
phone calls without warrants more.

2692
02:22:50,611 --> 02:22:53,370
Whatever the crazy shit they're doing now.
It shouldn't be that.

2693
02:22:53,430 --> 02:22:54,810
That's a sign of a sickness.

2694
02:22:55,050 --> 02:22:57,720
That's a sign of you trying to hang on
to your addiction while you're trying to

2695
02:22:57,721 --> 02:22:59,910
do is isolate everybody
and get them away from you.

2696
02:22:59,911 --> 02:23:03,300
You're trying to force yourself into
a position where you can control the

2697
02:23:03,301 --> 02:23:06,660
situation because you don't want to
accept the fact that you're living in

2698
02:23:06,740 --> 02:23:11,740
uninvolved life and the people that are
in charge of whatever the fuck it is,

2699
02:23:11,971 --> 02:23:15,420
call it whatever you want,
whatever it is that's moving us into war,

2700
02:23:15,570 --> 02:23:20,570
whatever it is that's sucking oil out of
the ground and the way you get it is by

2701
02:23:20,641 --> 02:23:24,420
Jack and countries and holding onto the
resources, whatever the fuck that is,

2702
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:28,080
they have to come to some sort of a
realization that this is an insane way to

2703
02:23:28,081 --> 02:23:28,490
live.

2704
02:23:28,490 --> 02:23:30,710
Yeah, it's the, it's the
resistance to change.

2705
02:23:30,711 --> 02:23:34,230
It's the resistance inevitability
that they do not want to accepts,

2706
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:37,940
that they're trying very hard to
maintain us into this, uh, ideological

2707
02:23:38,370 --> 02:23:41,970
controlling. Great. They fear this
connection so badly. They fear this,

2708
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:45,730
that it's coming down and that's why
they're trying to lock everything up.

2709
02:23:45,731 --> 02:23:49,090
And that's why they're trying to set
up these safe guards in place where

2710
02:23:49,091 --> 02:23:50,290
basically everything is legal.

2711
02:23:50,291 --> 02:23:52,430
They can just arrest you that you don't
have to have a lawyer. No, there's,

2712
02:23:52,580 --> 02:23:54,910
we have, you know, article
six, paragraph five.

2713
02:23:54,911 --> 02:23:57,130
We can go from fuck you
with hammers if we want to

2714
02:23:57,550 --> 02:24:01,190
talking about that. The thing that amber
was talking about at lunch with the, uh,

2715
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:04,990
the new, uh, the new NDA
bill. Oh, that's scary.

2716
02:24:04,991 --> 02:24:09,680
I was talking to you right
before we started about
this, the 2013 Nda with them.

2717
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,930
Well, there's a law right now that
basically says like the, the, the,

2718
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:17,500
the government can't turn propaganda
against American citizens,

2719
02:24:17,501 --> 02:24:19,330
so they're not allowed to
like have all that, you know,

2720
02:24:19,331 --> 02:24:21,610
war propaganda posters
and stuff like that.

2721
02:24:22,090 --> 02:24:26,860
For some reason people in Congress have
decided that they want to undo that and

2722
02:24:26,861 --> 02:24:29,440
it's going to be kind of another
writer in the same way that indefinite

2723
02:24:29,441 --> 02:24:34,441
detention was on the 2012
Nda and what we were like,

2724
02:24:34,690 --> 02:24:36,310
we were just kind of
theorizing it launched.

2725
02:24:36,490 --> 02:24:40,840
One of the ways that they could use that
is by using government funding to hire

2726
02:24:40,841 --> 02:24:42,460
people to basically sit on Twitter.
All right.

2727
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:45,590
That's what they already do. Well,
I mean, they already do it. I mean,

2728
02:24:45,591 --> 02:24:48,150
of course like when they were already
indefinitely detaining people before

2729
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:50,840
they'll have the green light, the
league, right light and the resources.

2730
02:24:50,900 --> 02:24:53,960
So as time goes on and shit
gets more and more crazy,

2731
02:24:53,961 --> 02:24:56,900
they can just do anything they
want and it will all be legal.

2732
02:24:56,930 --> 02:25:00,860
So they've essentially made being a
dictator league that we can destroy social

2733
02:25:00,861 --> 02:25:04,220
media in the same way they
destroyed mainstream media.
Instead of having like war

2734
02:25:04,410 --> 02:25:05,000
there's on the wall,

2735
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,650
what they'd have is like banks of
people sitting on Twitter all day,

2736
02:25:07,651 --> 02:25:08,730
like in for instance,

2737
02:25:08,731 --> 02:25:12,540
like going after Abby for like something
she says on her show and pretending not,

2738
02:25:12,541 --> 02:25:15,030
it's, they're not going to be labeled
as like a government Twitter account.

2739
02:25:15,031 --> 02:25:15,720
They're going to be like

2740
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:19,470
pretending. They're never going to
have the amount of enthusiasm zoom

2741
02:25:19,470 --> 02:25:21,940
that the people fighting them are
because they're just going to be shitty

2742
02:25:21,941 --> 02:25:25,240
government employees that don't have that
in mind as what they want to be doing

2743
02:25:25,241 --> 02:25:29,070
with their lives. Whereas people that
are fighting it, they're led by a vision.

2744
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:33,190
They're led by, they have a hope and
a dream for something being better.

2745
02:25:33,191 --> 02:25:36,760
And they have, they have passion.
These people, that's just their job.

2746
02:25:36,820 --> 02:25:40,000
It's just another obstacle in the people
that do things like that and just for a

2747
02:25:40,001 --> 02:25:41,110
job,
they suck at it.

2748
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:43,780
Like there are people on my message board
that are probably government agents.

2749
02:25:43,781 --> 02:25:44,890
They're fucking terrible at it.

2750
02:25:45,130 --> 02:25:50,130
I know there was trying to buy weed
from people laziest Deh and ever,

2751
02:25:50,530 --> 02:25:54,610
you know, it's like it's, it's pretty
obvious man. There's, there's, you know,

2752
02:25:55,300 --> 02:25:59,650
in order to get people
to be as charismatic,

2753
02:25:59,890 --> 02:26:03,520
to be as educated on the subject,
to be as,

2754
02:26:04,030 --> 02:26:06,790
as aware of what young
people are tuned into.

2755
02:26:06,790 --> 02:26:09,790
You'd have to like become one of
them. You know, you'd have to,

2756
02:26:10,030 --> 02:26:12,970
if you were working for the government
and you were working and you were,

2757
02:26:12,971 --> 02:26:16,210
you were supposed to be like an agent
provocateur and you were working on the

2758
02:26:16,211 --> 02:26:19,000
Internet with more and more
access to the Internet,

2759
02:26:19,001 --> 02:26:21,580
you're going to start looking at shinny
and where the fuck am I working for?

2760
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:24,130
You know, and if you're a 29
year old guy or 30 year old guy,

2761
02:26:24,131 --> 02:26:28,420
it's very possible that you would start
doing some things for the opposition.

2762
02:26:28,660 --> 02:26:31,960
It's very possible that a guy like
Bradley manning did exactly that,

2763
02:26:32,140 --> 02:26:34,270
that he's working for the government.

2764
02:26:34,271 --> 02:26:36,310
And you realize at one point
in time like holy shit,

2765
02:26:36,311 --> 02:26:39,790
like look at someone needs to see
this stuff. Like this is crazy stuff.

2766
02:26:39,940 --> 02:26:43,990
This is nuts. We're shooting these
reporters and they're joking about it.

2767
02:26:43,991 --> 02:26:45,490
They're making it seem
like it's no big deal.

2768
02:26:45,491 --> 02:26:48,190
And they're shooting a van full
of kids, you know, and to say,

2769
02:26:48,191 --> 02:26:49,240
well it shouldn't brought kids.

2770
02:26:49,241 --> 02:26:52,090
Like you're hearing shit like
that and you know what the fuck.

2771
02:26:52,870 --> 02:26:56,470
So this kid re releases it and now he's
an enemy of the state and they give him

2772
02:26:56,471 --> 02:26:58,650
the same brains, scrambled treatment
that they're giving people.

2773
02:26:58,940 --> 02:27:02,900
Donald, my dad, he's done. I mean, you
keep somebody in solitary for that long.

2774
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:05,810
That is torture.
It's torture and Ruthie bruise your brand.

2775
02:27:05,811 --> 02:27:07,520
You need stimulation
with other human beings.

2776
02:27:07,521 --> 02:27:09,090
You need to see other people's faces.
You need that too.

2777
02:27:09,220 --> 02:27:12,430
Right. So she can never
testify. He could never,

2778
02:27:12,490 --> 02:27:15,440
he never like plead his case.
Like literally they wrote

2779
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:18,550
and definitely not attention.
It has only been legal what?

2780
02:27:18,551 --> 02:27:21,650
Less than 365 days via the NDA.

2781
02:27:21,651 --> 02:27:25,460
But Bradley Manning's when in pretrial,
pretrial detention for over 900.

2782
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,280
Now, how crazy is that? Nobody's,

2783
02:27:28,370 --> 02:27:32,210
nobody's scrambling to try to get that
kid out and nobody's talking about it is

2784
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:33,710
part of their campaign strategy.

2785
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:38,530
No politicians and the people are,
most, a lot of people care about this,

2786
02:27:38,531 --> 02:27:40,360
but to be honest,
there are a lot of people who don't.

2787
02:27:40,810 --> 02:27:45,220
And recently there was this
huge controversy about Reddit
Gawker, which, you know,

2788
02:27:45,221 --> 02:27:45,511
Walker,

2789
02:27:45,511 --> 02:27:49,240
it's a big gossip blog out of the identity
of one of the moderators on Reddit

2790
02:27:49,270 --> 02:27:51,410
who was behind some of their,
uh,

2791
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:54,640
more a disgusting sections,

2792
02:27:54,641 --> 02:27:58,450
like one section posted photos of dead
girls who are under the age of 17.

2793
02:27:58,451 --> 02:28:00,850
That was like the specific purpose
of this community was to do that.

2794
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:04,540
And there are a lot of people online
who are outraged that his identity was

2795
02:28:04,990 --> 02:28:08,890
revealed in this article. And
it was a grandfather, was he?

2796
02:28:08,980 --> 02:28:12,250
I don't know that much about, I know
he was in Texas, but, uh, they were,

2797
02:28:12,251 --> 02:28:14,380
they were so outraged.
They were so outraged about this,

2798
02:28:14,381 --> 02:28:18,220
that they blocked Gawker from posting
links on many parts of Reddit to like

2799
02:28:18,221 --> 02:28:21,950
starve them of traffic, which
gawkers popular regardless. But, uh,

2800
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:25,820
I was seeing how fucking sick is that
you're defending this scumbag when

2801
02:28:25,821 --> 02:28:28,420
meanwhile are actual political activists
who were having their anonymous

2802
02:28:28,550 --> 02:28:31,520
anonymity stripped away from them and
they're being fronted a fucking prison

2803
02:28:31,521 --> 02:28:34,070
cells and there are hacktivists or
having the same thing done to them.

2804
02:28:34,280 --> 02:28:37,160
Like Jeremy Hammon, I think his
name is, and you don't see any,

2805
02:28:37,161 --> 02:28:40,400
you don't see any upward or on reddit or
Digg about that shit because it's like

2806
02:28:40,401 --> 02:28:41,930
people were like, there's
a disconnect. You know.

2807
02:28:42,230 --> 02:28:45,470
What about Obama prosecuted more whistle
blowers in any other administration

2808
02:28:45,471 --> 02:28:50,440
combined easily an antiquated law from
world war one 1917. What's the law?

2809
02:28:50,510 --> 02:28:55,100
The espionage act for spies during World
War One. They charged Thomas Drake,

2810
02:28:55,101 --> 02:28:56,690
some guy who was an NSA whistleblower,

2811
02:28:56,691 --> 02:29:01,280
but an illegal torture and spine
program and they fucking tried to, uh,

2812
02:29:01,460 --> 02:29:03,720
put him in jail for 20 years
for it has to be matched.

2813
02:29:04,010 --> 02:29:07,130
Bradley manning the same thing, which
could have the death penalty. I mean,

2814
02:29:07,131 --> 02:29:11,110
that's a very serious charge. Aiding the
enemy to not that hope he changes it.

2815
02:29:13,340 --> 02:29:14,780
Yeah,
it's pretty intense.

2816
02:29:15,100 --> 02:29:18,100
What do you guys see happening
in the future? What do you,

2817
02:29:18,130 --> 02:29:20,380
how do you see this playing out?
Do you have any idea?

2818
02:29:20,381 --> 02:29:21,910
Is it ridiculous to even guess,

2819
02:29:22,210 --> 02:29:24,940
but it seems that we're building
towards an event. It doesn't,

2820
02:29:24,970 --> 02:29:27,140
it doesn't seem to me that,
you know,

2821
02:29:27,190 --> 02:29:31,090
we can continue with all these
various aspects, the continual, uh,

2822
02:29:31,180 --> 02:29:35,320
the wars overseas,
the battle for resources,

2823
02:29:35,321 --> 02:29:39,430
the crazy people that we have representing
us that don't seem to have anything

2824
02:29:39,431 --> 02:29:44,200
in line with our own personal needs or
our own wants or desires as a nation.

2825
02:29:44,490 --> 02:29:47,200
It seems like we're being led.
We're on a pirate ship,

2826
02:29:47,201 --> 02:29:49,480
we're on this crazy fucking
pirate ship and we're slow.

2827
02:29:49,930 --> 02:29:51,400
We're about to hit the rock somewhere.

2828
02:29:51,490 --> 02:29:53,310
I think, uh, I always tell people,

2829
02:29:53,390 --> 02:29:56,160
I mean people who vote in the
presidential elections and,

2830
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:59,230
and think that there's going to be some
sort of change that can never happen.

2831
02:29:59,231 --> 02:30:01,510
It's only coming from grassroots
is only coming from the bottom up.

2832
02:30:01,511 --> 02:30:02,590
And I think that if you,

2833
02:30:03,490 --> 02:30:06,850
you just acknowledged that voting
is something that you do every day,

2834
02:30:07,060 --> 02:30:09,880
multiple times a day.
I mean everything you do is politicize.

2835
02:30:09,881 --> 02:30:11,830
Everything you'd do can,
can have an impact.

2836
02:30:11,831 --> 02:30:13,120
So I think the conversations you have,

2837
02:30:13,121 --> 02:30:15,260
the dialogue you engage
in as the business,

2838
02:30:15,261 --> 02:30:18,490
as you choose to support the websites
you go to, the media you consume.

2839
02:30:18,491 --> 02:30:20,200
I mean all of that is an act of voting.

2840
02:30:20,201 --> 02:30:24,520
All of that can enact some sort of
change. And so it's just, it's just,

2841
02:30:24,521 --> 02:30:27,940
it's easy to get disillusioned
and disempowered from
getting sucked into these

2842
02:30:27,941 --> 02:30:32,880
fucking election cycles that are just
psychically van pampers thick. I Dunno,

2843
02:30:32,950 --> 02:30:33,540
it's hard

2844
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:36,520
feel like you can have it have an
effect on something like a presidential

2845
02:30:36,521 --> 02:30:37,270
election maybe.

2846
02:30:37,270 --> 02:30:39,510
Like a lot of people feel like it
doesn't really matter if I go and vote.

2847
02:30:39,511 --> 02:30:40,210
What the,

2848
02:30:40,210 --> 02:30:45,210
where they can have an effect is
like what people like David like on a

2849
02:30:46,211 --> 02:30:50,590
congressional level and on in midterm
elections and specifically in primaries

2850
02:30:50,591 --> 02:30:54,130
where a lot of good,
perhaps good politicians get pushed out.

2851
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:55,240
Dude,

2852
02:30:55,240 --> 02:30:58,150
if you can get in there and give us an
inside view of what the fuck is going on

2853
02:30:58,151 --> 02:31:00,820
with that machine, that fast
fascinate, I have my Google glasses on.

2854
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:07,200
Just an insight to how the fucking
machine runs cause it must be way more

2855
02:31:07,601 --> 02:31:10,950
complicated than I imagine it must be.
Just

2856
02:31:11,230 --> 02:31:12,080
I feel like there's a lot of,

2857
02:31:12,081 --> 02:31:14,150
probably like a ton of pressure
just coming down on you. Okay.

2858
02:31:15,070 --> 02:31:18,640
Very hard. You can't get there unless
you've already sucked the lizard cock.

2859
02:31:18,670 --> 02:31:19,990
But here's, here's the thing. If

2860
02:31:20,150 --> 02:31:24,960
he was going to bring you into a room
with a blizzard, fucking lizard cognitive,

2861
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:25,620
well,

2862
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:28,140
the model that we're basing this on is
a little bit different from the Lizard

2863
02:31:28,141 --> 02:31:30,560
Cock sucking model. It's improved. Uh,

2864
02:31:31,050 --> 02:31:33,840
if we get lots of
contributions from individuals,

2865
02:31:33,841 --> 02:31:36,780
like tens of thousands of small
donations from real people,

2866
02:31:37,140 --> 02:31:40,110
you're beholden to those people.
Instead of being beholden to the,

2867
02:31:40,130 --> 02:31:44,250
like NPA or the defense lobby
or any other shit or Israel,

2868
02:31:44,251 --> 02:31:45,420
US relations lobby,

2869
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:49,290
you're now only beholden to the people
who actually help get you into office and

2870
02:31:49,291 --> 02:31:50,220
your constituents.

2871
02:31:50,280 --> 02:31:53,130
And that's the way representation
is supposed to work in this country.

2872
02:31:53,310 --> 02:31:55,620
And it no longer does that.
Cause most people feel powerless.

2873
02:31:55,740 --> 02:31:59,490
Most people have never given $20 to
anything in their life that is political.

2874
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,110
There are lot of people go,
I don't like politics.

2875
02:32:01,400 --> 02:32:02,820
And they didn't give money to Ron Paul.

2876
02:32:03,030 --> 02:32:06,210
They're not giving money to Gary Johnson
or any of these people who if you were

2877
02:32:06,211 --> 02:32:08,580
to give them money,
it would make a huge difference.

2878
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:10,950
But how sad is it that
that's what it takes? Well,

2879
02:32:10,951 --> 02:32:13,800
money's been elections and
politics since the dawn of time.

2880
02:32:13,801 --> 02:32:17,850
Unfortunately we have super pacs are
new and fucked up and that needs to be

2881
02:32:17,851 --> 02:32:20,580
reversed as soon as possible.
We need to clean election system and like,

2882
02:32:20,581 --> 02:32:23,850
but there's other ways. I mean, it
doesn't have to be that way. Well,

2883
02:32:23,851 --> 02:32:28,480
it would be nice if people could
vote online. It seems silly. Yeah,

2884
02:32:28,660 --> 02:32:30,660
exactly. Thank you. No,
it doesn't make any sense.

2885
02:32:30,661 --> 02:32:33,540
If you mommy murder money's safe online,

2886
02:32:33,570 --> 02:32:37,140
really come on the fucking billions
and trillions of dollars that are moved

2887
02:32:37,141 --> 02:32:39,750
around with ones and Zeros
and they haven't hacked that.

2888
02:32:39,930 --> 02:32:41,460
But you're saying they can hack.
Well,

2889
02:32:41,461 --> 02:32:43,210
they've already hacked your
fucking voting machine,

2890
02:32:43,211 --> 02:32:45,090
so those things aren't good either.
How could that be?

2891
02:32:45,091 --> 02:32:49,170
So little transparency and these bulky
boxes, like you can't see how it works.

2892
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:52,410
We count it. There's no backup.
There's no verification.

2893
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:56,160
And if you've ever watched hacking
democracy and then you watched die bolds

2894
02:32:56,340 --> 02:32:59,640
change of their name after that dot.
That hacking democracy,

2895
02:32:59,910 --> 02:33:03,390
Hbo Show where they showed how those
fucking machines are set up for a third

2896
02:33:03,391 --> 02:33:06,810
party input to alter the number.
You can alter the numbers. Yeah,

2897
02:33:06,811 --> 02:33:10,140
you can change it and like by 10% or
something crazy. That should be illegal,

2898
02:33:10,141 --> 02:33:10,720
by the way.

2899
02:33:10,720 --> 02:33:14,000
[inaudible] a corporation that's doing
evil shit and you just rebrand as

2900
02:33:14,001 --> 02:33:14,521
something else,

2901
02:33:14,521 --> 02:33:17,220
but you retain all the same
leadership in the same actual company.

2902
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:21,680
That'd be like Charles Manson being like,
I'm going to rebrand is Chris,

2903
02:33:21,690 --> 02:33:23,260
whatever and then like he's out of prison.

2904
02:33:23,930 --> 02:33:28,710
Sadie becoming p diddy
like who are you really

2905
02:33:31,410 --> 02:33:33,770
ridiculous job,
but that's just hanging out with reggae.

2906
02:33:33,780 --> 02:33:37,030
Do you smoke a lot of weed?
You'll think you're a cat. Also,

2907
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:40,230
the CEO of Diebold told Bush at a
campaign event. He was just like, we,

2908
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:42,980
you will get in.
You know the president.

2909
02:33:45,720 --> 02:33:50,430
I know I need mushrooms. They all
need to be taken away. I live in DC.

2910
02:33:50,431 --> 02:33:50,821
I am just like,

2911
02:33:50,821 --> 02:33:55,740
I just want to dose all the politicians
there and like all the CIA should be

2912
02:33:55,741 --> 02:33:59,160
able to get into politics and I don't
think like once you leave politics you

2913
02:33:59,161 --> 02:34:00,730
should be able to go work
for the corporation. Yeah.

2914
02:34:00,870 --> 02:34:02,940
The were like Supreme Court
justices that go work.

2915
02:34:03,330 --> 02:34:07,080
Like they'll overturn a law
and then they'll go join a
corporation that benefits

2916
02:34:07,081 --> 02:34:07,831
from it.
Of course we'll,

2917
02:34:07,831 --> 02:34:11,670
how about people that construct financial
studies that that benefit people in

2918
02:34:11,671 --> 02:34:12,850
Wall Street and then there,

2919
02:34:12,851 --> 02:34:16,350
there are universities when they do this
then they get out of that and they get

2920
02:34:16,351 --> 02:34:19,390
jobs with these very firms that they've
helped protect and make money from it.

2921
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:22,210
And you find out that they're making
millions of dollars, you know,

2922
02:34:22,211 --> 02:34:24,340
working for these corporations
now are the opposite.

2923
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:26,440
Like Halliburton and Dick
Cheney obviously that was,

2924
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:29,290
that'd be the biggest example. The
most ridiculous whenever, right.

2925
02:34:29,610 --> 02:34:34,150
A guy who's a CEO of a company that
fits his shit after it gets blown up,

2926
02:34:34,180 --> 02:34:38,440
gets in office and then decides to blow
up everything and then give them no bid

2927
02:34:38,441 --> 02:34:41,050
contracts to fiction and
they did a horrible job too.

2928
02:34:41,051 --> 02:34:43,930
I just watched something on that the other
day where they were talking about the

2929
02:34:43,931 --> 02:34:44,830
quality of the water,

2930
02:34:44,831 --> 02:34:47,800
like the quality of the services they
were providing the soldiers but it was

2931
02:34:47,801 --> 02:34:48,491
just ridiculous.

2932
02:34:48,491 --> 02:34:51,760
And then you sounded like burn pits cause
they had like they would like take all

2933
02:34:51,761 --> 02:34:52,451
this,
all this,

2934
02:34:52,451 --> 02:34:55,780
all this equipment that was bought by
taxpayers and it was just like chunk it

2935
02:34:55,781 --> 02:34:58,540
away like the waste or is just phenomenal.
It's because the more they spend,

2936
02:34:58,570 --> 02:34:59,380
the more they got paid.

2937
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:03,100
Now I have to bring this up because it's
been discussed online and you explained

2938
02:35:03,101 --> 02:35:05,640
it all, but there was like
some discussion that you,

2939
02:35:05,670 --> 02:35:07,960
you were misrepresenting
where you were running.

2940
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:09,360
There was a confusion as to where,

2941
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:12,010
just so everybody knows
what the actual facts are,

2942
02:35:12,011 --> 02:35:16,560
where are you running for Congress and
when so people can support you. Sure. Uh,

2943
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:19,450
the election is November 4th,

2944
02:35:19,450 --> 02:35:23,430
2014 I'm running in the 23rd district of
Florida will be no world. Then I said,

2945
02:35:23,620 --> 02:35:24,580
here's the,
here's the problem.

2946
02:35:24,581 --> 02:35:27,460
If you run as an independent candidate
and you decide last minute to jump in,

2947
02:35:27,461 --> 02:35:30,790
which is what a lot of independence do,
you get your fucking ass handed to you.

2948
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:34,690
So instead we're being very deliberate
and slow and careful and gradually

2949
02:35:34,691 --> 02:35:35,471
building this thing out.

2950
02:35:35,471 --> 02:35:39,490
We've already had like 110 people sign
up to volunteer or volunteer to help us

2951
02:35:39,491 --> 02:35:42,640
campaign. And uh, we're raising donations.

2952
02:35:42,641 --> 02:35:45,880
We filed with the FEC but
we filed with the IRS.

2953
02:35:45,881 --> 02:35:49,910
We have all of rough financial stuff
figured out and the chaotic dotting all of

2954
02:35:49,911 --> 02:35:51,610
our i's,
crossing our t's.

2955
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:53,890
So that's why we're running so early
because we actually want to win.

2956
02:35:53,891 --> 02:35:56,320
This isn't some halfassed independent
campaign and make a point.

2957
02:35:56,560 --> 02:35:57,520
It's to actually win.

2958
02:35:57,750 --> 02:36:02,320
And I had never said I was running in
2012 what happened is I did a Reddit Ama

2959
02:36:02,650 --> 02:36:05,200
were a couple of guys swooped in and I
think it might have actually been one guy

2960
02:36:05,201 --> 02:36:08,920
with two usernames and they kept
saying his campaign's a fraud,

2961
02:36:09,130 --> 02:36:12,100
don't contribute to it. It might even be
illegal to contribute to this campaign.

2962
02:36:12,430 --> 02:36:14,320
They're saying this shit.
And then as soon as I saw it,

2963
02:36:14,321 --> 02:36:15,790
I replied and explained everything.

2964
02:36:16,060 --> 02:36:18,670
And there was some confusion about the
district cause it was previously called

2965
02:36:18,671 --> 02:36:22,210
the 20th district. And so at first
our website did say 20th district.

2966
02:36:22,211 --> 02:36:25,210
It was redistricted. I mean
redistricting is incredibly complicated.

2967
02:36:25,211 --> 02:36:28,720
I don't fully understand it, uh,
be honest about that. But, uh,

2968
02:36:29,710 --> 02:36:33,430
so I responded, any rational person
who read that would say, okay,

2969
02:36:33,431 --> 02:36:36,430
this explains everything. But then
these guys down voted that comment.

2970
02:36:36,431 --> 02:36:39,640
So it was buried. If you were skimming,
you're like, why didn't he answer this?

2971
02:36:39,790 --> 02:36:42,250
And then they would post it again and
I would comment again and they would

2972
02:36:42,251 --> 02:36:45,370
download it like negative 10 votes and
then that was, I was like, this is fucked.

2973
02:36:45,371 --> 02:36:47,980
Like I'm done with the Reddit Ama
for today. Cause it was so good.

2974
02:36:47,981 --> 02:36:49,750
And then a couple people
went in and ruined it.

2975
02:36:50,540 --> 02:36:54,640
You think that that could be people that
look at you as a potential threat in

2976
02:36:54,641 --> 02:36:58,090
the future and they want to try to
squash him now I don't know if I'm that

2977
02:36:58,091 --> 02:37:00,070
important yet. I think they're
just assholes to figure out.

2978
02:37:00,071 --> 02:37:01,870
There's going to be a certain
point in time when you are,

2979
02:37:01,900 --> 02:37:03,180
there are trolls out there and it,

2980
02:37:03,250 --> 02:37:05,630
there are trolls out there and they
do love to take people that, yeah,

2981
02:37:06,010 --> 02:37:08,440
they see somebody who's putting their ass
on the line and they don't really like

2982
02:37:08,441 --> 02:37:09,760
that cause it calls them out.

2983
02:37:10,030 --> 02:37:12,910
You know that they're just sitting there
criticizing other people will also,

2984
02:37:12,940 --> 02:37:16,940
you're, you're smart and
what you're saying is pretty
fascinating and what you're

2985
02:37:16,941 --> 02:37:17,271
saying,

2986
02:37:17,271 --> 02:37:19,970
you have a lot of conviction behind and
people don't like people that are better

2987
02:37:19,971 --> 02:37:20,780
than themselves.

2988
02:37:20,780 --> 02:37:24,170
They know they're going to like someone
who they can't like look at him and look.

2989
02:37:24,171 --> 02:37:28,130
They look at what I've done in my life
by the time I'm 26 and I'm kind of a

2990
02:37:28,131 --> 02:37:33,020
fucking loser compared to this guy
whose last name is seaman. Fuck.

2991
02:37:33,430 --> 02:37:35,780
The last name is ridiculous.
Yeah, but you've got to keep,

2992
02:37:35,781 --> 02:37:37,510
I'm not going to change it.
You've got to own what you are.

2993
02:37:37,540 --> 02:37:42,230
My last name is fucking just like,
you should change it to that David.

2994
02:37:42,231 --> 02:37:46,040
Just warm,
just like David Seaman.

2995
02:37:46,070 --> 02:37:51,070
Do you really want a man in office with
the last name sperm that's going to,

2996
02:37:51,470 --> 02:37:54,400
is that going to be a part of a
campaign against you? Is Mark? In fact,

2997
02:37:54,430 --> 02:37:56,870
if anything, the last thing probably
helps with young voters, but uh,

2998
02:37:57,200 --> 02:38:02,200
David voted against the Patriot Act white
splatter on the screen to be serious

2999
02:38:03,021 --> 02:38:04,970
for a second.
What's really important about my campaign,

3000
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:08,600
it's not even that one person
out of 435 member house.

3001
02:38:08,750 --> 02:38:11,780
It makes that much of a difference
aside from being able to introduce

3002
02:38:11,781 --> 02:38:13,310
legislation,
which will make a difference.

3003
02:38:13,590 --> 02:38:15,950
But the big thing is if
this actually happens,

3004
02:38:16,130 --> 02:38:19,190
we're going to create a
handbook and distribute it
to other people around my age

3005
02:38:19,191 --> 02:38:22,220
and in anybody's interested in running
and not interested in affiliating

3006
02:38:22,221 --> 02:38:25,400
themselves with super pacs are with
lobbying groups or with one of the two big

3007
02:38:25,401 --> 02:38:28,550
parties. You show them the handbook
of here's how it can be done.

3008
02:38:28,820 --> 02:38:32,780
Use the Internet instead of a party.
Raise small individual donations.

3009
02:38:32,930 --> 02:38:34,160
Remain relatively honest.

3010
02:38:34,161 --> 02:38:37,220
Don't fucking sell out six months before
the election to the Koch brothers or

3011
02:38:37,221 --> 02:38:41,000
something. And if you release
this handbook and you go,
this has been done before,

3012
02:38:41,001 --> 02:38:42,800
here's the,
the recipe.

3013
02:38:42,980 --> 02:38:46,130
So many people will flood into congress
who are more like more like you and me.

3014
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:49,580
Just actual people who are pissed off at
the way things are going and feel like

3015
02:38:49,790 --> 02:38:52,340
if we had some rationality in there
and things would get better and you're

3016
02:38:52,341 --> 02:38:54,080
already seeing that happening, like
it's going to happen. It's just,

3017
02:38:54,081 --> 02:38:57,530
I'd rather have it happen two years from
now instead of 10 or 15 years from now.

3018
02:38:58,700 --> 02:39:03,110
Do you think that you have to worry
about your safety with this plan in mind?

3019
02:39:03,230 --> 02:39:04,430
Do you think about that at all?

3020
02:39:04,700 --> 02:39:07,730
What I'm doing is a great thing and I
mean to worry about your safety for just

3021
02:39:07,731 --> 02:39:10,430
trying to improve the country. Isn't
that crazy though? It is crazy.

3022
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:11,811
I bet people say like,

3023
02:39:11,811 --> 02:39:14,760
you're probably on some lists now
and I used to be like kind of, uh,

3024
02:39:14,870 --> 02:39:17,510
Alex Jones about, about that. I was
like, Shit, I probably am on some lists,

3025
02:39:17,690 --> 02:39:21,860
you know? But now I think it's kind
of, I'm kind of flattered by it.

3026
02:39:21,861 --> 02:39:24,530
If the government's reading my emails
and my texts are probably a little bit

3027
02:39:24,531 --> 02:39:28,880
impressed that Dell and I have marshaled
this kind of support this far out and

3028
02:39:28,881 --> 02:39:31,970
that our, our campaign is really
just about what we say it's about.

3029
02:39:32,150 --> 02:39:35,870
It's not actually secretly backed by
the clean coal lobby or some bullshit.

3030
02:39:35,880 --> 02:39:38,790
It's just the campaign of people who
want to see better representation and

3031
02:39:38,800 --> 02:39:41,150
that's all it is.
So if they're watching you,

3032
02:39:41,151 --> 02:39:44,070
they're probably a little bit impressed,
no longer afraid of, you know,

3033
02:39:44,090 --> 02:39:47,540
having somebody Julian Assange be by
hooking me up with some like hooker or

3034
02:39:47,541 --> 02:39:52,470
something and the taping it, you know, if
that happens free hooker, I dunno, Hooker,

3035
02:39:52,810 --> 02:39:53,780
um,
I mean this,

3036
02:39:53,781 --> 02:39:57,290
but if you look at what this a NSA
building that they're putting together in

3037
02:39:57,291 --> 02:39:59,930
Utah,
that's going to spy on everybody you know,

3038
02:39:59,970 --> 02:40:03,830
and store all your data for all your
emails and text messages and all that

3039
02:40:03,831 --> 02:40:07,880
craziness. I mean that to me seems
like they think everyone's a threat.

3040
02:40:07,940 --> 02:40:11,120
So your threat to dude, if
you're on the show, well that's,

3041
02:40:11,121 --> 02:40:14,070
that's why we got do this now is in
like within next two years instead

3042
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:15,480
of 15 years from now we won't have,

3043
02:40:15,540 --> 02:40:18,660
we won't have a republic cause it's going
to be, oh you want to run for office?

3044
02:40:18,661 --> 02:40:22,410
Let's pull up these emails that we have
in our NSA database of you saying this

3045
02:40:22,411 --> 02:40:24,540
pretty scandalous shit to somebody.
What do you want?

3046
02:40:24,541 --> 02:40:26,810
You want us to go public with this because
then it's going to run your campaign.

3047
02:40:26,820 --> 02:40:28,320
Then you go, okay, I'll
resign. Is there a way

3048
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:30,900
change the tone of this country?
Is there a way,

3049
02:40:30,930 --> 02:40:33,900
I mean because of the tone of this
country clearly changed on September 11th

3050
02:40:33,901 --> 02:40:36,450
clearly it did. It went
dark. Everything went crazy.

3051
02:40:36,451 --> 02:40:39,870
We realize the repercussions of what
the fuck we're doing. I mean if, if,

3052
02:40:39,871 --> 02:40:43,230
whether or not it's a, a, a false
flag event and they, you know,

3053
02:40:43,231 --> 02:40:45,840
they orchestrated it or
terrorist hate us so much.

3054
02:40:45,841 --> 02:40:48,280
They're willing to fucking sacrifice
people's lives and fly people into

3055
02:40:48,300 --> 02:40:49,770
buildings.
Whatever's going on.

3056
02:40:49,771 --> 02:40:54,390
We realize there's repercussions to
whoever is in office, being an office,

3057
02:40:54,420 --> 02:40:59,100
whoever is in government, whoever's
in conducting world affairs, who else?

3058
02:40:59,160 --> 02:41:02,670
There's obviously some fucking chaos
because they wanted to make a big noise.

3059
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:05,070
They wanted to make a big splash
and kill a bunch of people.

3060
02:41:05,810 --> 02:41:08,360
There are two. How can that change?
Two things that could change.

3061
02:41:08,361 --> 02:41:12,110
One is shows like yours where you're
opening real conversations and shows like

3062
02:41:12,111 --> 02:41:16,220
yours where the people on TV with Abby
Martins shell, you know you're like, oh,

3063
02:41:16,221 --> 02:41:19,310
she's kind of like me. She's
not some last robot, she's not.

3064
02:41:19,311 --> 02:41:23,450
Some plastic person is just being fed
these Fox News talking points and you

3065
02:41:23,451 --> 02:41:24,470
probably know at the end of the day,

3066
02:41:24,500 --> 02:41:27,950
at the end of the day that you're at the
very least distracting people from the

3067
02:41:27,951 --> 02:41:30,560
real issues. I'm sure those people go
home knowing that and they go, well,

3068
02:41:30,561 --> 02:41:33,110
I'm getting paid $3 million to do it,
so who really gives a shit, you know?

3069
02:41:33,340 --> 02:41:37,040
And that that's the first thing.
The second thing I think is a,

3070
02:41:38,300 --> 02:41:39,410
you just have to keep going.
Like,

3071
02:41:39,411 --> 02:41:42,080
you can't stop just because
there are some issues out there.

3072
02:41:42,081 --> 02:41:43,070
I feel a lot of people,

3073
02:41:43,340 --> 02:41:46,820
there's a silent majority who is fed
up with the TSA groping them and fed up

3074
02:41:46,821 --> 02:41:49,820
with US spending this much money on
programs that we maybe don't really need.

3075
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:52,840
Well, the problem with the surveillance
data is the chilling effect.

3076
02:41:52,850 --> 02:41:56,470
It makes people a stifled
into not dissenting,

3077
02:41:56,680 --> 02:41:58,750
not speaking out as much because
when, you know, if you have a mic,

3078
02:41:58,770 --> 02:42:00,580
if you have a recording device on a table,

3079
02:42:00,581 --> 02:42:02,910
you're not going to say the
same things as you were before.

3080
02:42:03,190 --> 02:42:06,040
And so when you know that you're
being watched everywhere, um,

3081
02:42:06,090 --> 02:42:09,100
recorded everywhere,
surveilled, uh, data, mind,

3082
02:42:09,101 --> 02:42:12,140
you're not going to speak out as much.
I've heard I've had so many people say,

3083
02:42:12,141 --> 02:42:14,680
you know, aren't you terrified? And
I'm like, I'm just speaking the truth.

3084
02:42:14,681 --> 02:42:17,530
I'm just speaking what I
believe and, uh, you know,

3085
02:42:17,980 --> 02:42:19,810
talking about what I'm
passionate about and if,

3086
02:42:19,811 --> 02:42:24,250
and if everyone kind of shed themselves
of that fear and didn't let that affect

3087
02:42:24,251 --> 02:42:28,290
the way that they acted, then I think
that the country would be a lot different.

3088
02:42:28,380 --> 02:42:30,360
They're not going to be able to
hold on to that kind of power.

3089
02:42:30,361 --> 02:42:34,500
I don't think it's going to be exclusive
to them. I think the Internet, the, the,

3090
02:42:34,501 --> 02:42:38,430
the, this, just this sort of intertwining
of information into our lives.

3091
02:42:38,431 --> 02:42:41,810
I think it's going to get to a point
where there's just this zero point, well,

3092
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:43,710
there's this point of,
you know,

3093
02:42:43,711 --> 02:42:47,970
what Terence Mckenna called ultimate
novelty or we're going to reach some new

3094
02:42:47,971 --> 02:42:52,440
paradigm, new shift in
English. Yes. Look, we look at,

3095
02:42:52,441 --> 02:42:53,251
we can do now,

3096
02:42:53,251 --> 02:42:56,280
but just with Google and cell phones
and just the ability to talk to people

3097
02:42:56,281 --> 02:42:57,680
where you're driving
your car home and see,

3098
02:42:57,720 --> 02:43:01,290
it's really a crazy connectivity that
we've sort of taken for granted because

3099
02:43:01,291 --> 02:43:04,020
it's just Bluetooth in my car.
It's kind of cool,

3100
02:43:04,021 --> 02:43:06,240
but you get used to it after awhile and
you do business while you're stuck in

3101
02:43:06,241 --> 02:43:07,980
traffic. But that's a, it's,

3102
02:43:08,150 --> 02:43:11,440
it's a weird thing and that's
just what we know exists.

3103
02:43:11,441 --> 02:43:14,650
Could someone invented it? They
haven't stopped doing that. Okay.

3104
02:43:14,860 --> 02:43:18,490
They're going to continue and they're
probably on the cusp of releasing some

3105
02:43:18,491 --> 02:43:19,870
shit over the next decade or so.

3106
02:43:19,871 --> 02:43:22,900
That's going to make that
look like nothing and then
no one's going to have any

3107
02:43:22,901 --> 02:43:27,010
privacy and we're going to have to accept
this whole idea of like humans being

3108
02:43:27,011 --> 02:43:31,180
one. You know that the human race is
just one big gigantic super organism.

3109
02:43:31,390 --> 02:43:33,040
Well that's going to be real as fuck.

3110
02:43:33,100 --> 02:43:36,340
Like it's not just going to be some
sort of a hippy dippy yoga phrase,

3111
02:43:36,580 --> 02:43:39,160
you know that you say because it makes
you feel better. It's going to be,

3112
02:43:39,220 --> 02:43:41,350
it's going to be real.
You're going to be able to see,

3113
02:43:41,351 --> 02:43:45,100
everyone's going to know the real live
repercussions of all sorts of different

3114
02:43:45,101 --> 02:43:46,030
types of behavior.

3115
02:43:46,390 --> 02:43:49,090
We're going to be able to see how
people really feel about each other.

3116
02:43:49,091 --> 02:43:52,220
We're going to see, you know,
how people really view you.

3117
02:43:52,420 --> 02:43:55,450
It's going to be very different
than life now and it's inevitable.

3118
02:43:55,451 --> 02:43:58,960
It's not gonna. It's not gonna stop.
Just like we were one point in time,

3119
02:43:58,961 --> 02:44:00,820
animals with no communication whatsoever.

3120
02:44:00,821 --> 02:44:03,700
We were one time single celled
organisms with no, you know,

3121
02:44:03,701 --> 02:44:08,220
no way of making any noise and we became
this thing and this thing is not going

3122
02:44:08,221 --> 02:44:11,980
to stay this thing forever. This thing's
going to be some wait fucking crazier.

3123
02:44:12,190 --> 02:44:16,210
So are all of our problems that we
have right now are the the monkey mind,

3124
02:44:16,480 --> 02:44:21,480
the fucking wild male dominant chimpanzee
mind that's trying to take over the

3125
02:44:22,421 --> 02:44:25,480
world.
While while this is happening,

3126
02:44:25,510 --> 02:44:30,510
technology is just moving closer and
closer in on it and it's scrambling and

3127
02:44:31,241 --> 02:44:32,740
they're trying to do the most arcane.

3128
02:44:32,740 --> 02:44:35,850
We can just lock them up for no fucking
reason. Yes, lock 'em up and they're,

3129
02:44:35,851 --> 02:44:39,640
they're doing all this things. It's
because the, the troops are circling,

3130
02:44:39,730 --> 02:44:40,810
people are circling.

3131
02:44:40,811 --> 02:44:45,811
There's like this big ant death spiral
of the more madness that we operate

3132
02:44:46,211 --> 02:44:49,290
under, the, the more access to
information than we have. The,

3133
02:44:49,291 --> 02:44:50,440
the crazier it's gonna get.

3134
02:44:50,441 --> 02:44:54,310
It's gonna get to a point where it can't
be contained because everyone will be

3135
02:44:54,311 --> 02:44:58,360
involved in it. It won't be as simple
as there's world bankers can tell the,

3136
02:44:58,361 --> 02:45:00,010
you know,
the troops to move into certain positions.

3137
02:45:00,250 --> 02:45:01,960
The troops are going to know
exactly where it's coming from.

3138
02:45:01,961 --> 02:45:03,160
Everyone's going to know
where it's coming from.

3139
02:45:03,161 --> 02:45:07,110
Everyone's going to know why it's coming
from, from, from, from whatever. You know,

3140
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:08,740
whatever group is pushing,

3141
02:45:08,920 --> 02:45:11,950
whatever agenda that's forcing people
that die and they're going to be punished

3142
02:45:11,951 --> 02:45:13,840
for it.
There's just no way.

3143
02:45:13,870 --> 02:45:17,650
There's no way you can keep this fucking
game going on unless you bomb us back

3144
02:45:17,651 --> 02:45:21,700
to the stone age and it
only a few thousand people
survive, then it's possible.

3145
02:45:21,790 --> 02:45:24,460
So if you are real speculator,

3146
02:45:24,490 --> 02:45:27,430
and if you looked at like if you
looked at the human race and listen we,

3147
02:45:27,431 --> 02:45:28,870
there's no way we're going
to be able to keep this up.

3148
02:45:29,080 --> 02:45:33,190
We're going to have to do is build
something about five miles into the ground

3149
02:45:33,430 --> 02:45:37,390
and we're, we can keep you alive for
about three years. That's what we need.

3150
02:45:37,391 --> 02:45:40,390
And we need about a year for the
radioactive waste to die off.

3151
02:45:40,450 --> 02:45:43,930
And then we come up back to the surface
when most of the people are dead and we

3152
02:45:43,931 --> 02:45:46,000
start all over again.
Follow

3153
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:51,370
the apparently this
part five minutes folks.

3154
02:45:52,010 --> 02:45:56,910
12 what is going to, I
can't, I can't keep going.

3155
02:45:56,930 --> 02:45:57,760
Yeah,
there has to be.

3156
02:45:57,760 --> 02:46:00,850
I don't think there'd be as many people
online trying to change things if we

3157
02:46:00,851 --> 02:46:03,040
were all hopeless.
I mean if we're very truly hopeless,

3158
02:46:03,041 --> 02:46:05,490
like people like Abby and dude,
like if you care about your country,

3159
02:46:05,510 --> 02:46:07,220
you like to see it do better.
Yeah.

3160
02:46:07,480 --> 02:46:10,100
You don't want to see it devolve into
a bunch of fucking Walmart parking

3161
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:13,850
lots and protesters being beaten
and surveillance cameras everywhere.

3162
02:46:13,851 --> 02:46:16,760
I think our goal of mean to or being
like upbeat throughout this show,

3163
02:46:16,761 --> 02:46:21,500
like we failed. It's not
hopeless. It's ridiculous.

3164
02:46:21,560 --> 02:46:23,330
It's not hopeless.
It's just ridiculous.

3165
02:46:23,390 --> 02:46:26,270
The human society as we know
it is a temporary thing.

3166
02:46:26,830 --> 02:46:28,160
It's not going to stay this way camp.

3167
02:46:28,450 --> 02:46:33,190
It just can't [inaudible] this is the
way of fucking books and town meetings

3168
02:46:33,370 --> 02:46:35,560
where two people talk loud
cause they had no microphones.

3169
02:46:35,740 --> 02:46:39,070
This is the way of the small
tribes led by a few leaders.

3170
02:46:39,370 --> 02:46:43,450
Shit doesn't work anymore.
So it's a global world
environment we're living with.

3171
02:46:43,690 --> 02:46:46,450
That's what we're living with. But we're,
we're, we're, we're all connected now.

3172
02:46:47,090 --> 02:46:50,310
Does Jason Silva videos where it's
like an amazing future is technology is

3173
02:46:50,311 --> 02:46:51,144
uplifted us.

3174
02:46:51,390 --> 02:46:55,260
That's what happens if we actually do our
parts and speak out and take a role in

3175
02:46:55,320 --> 02:46:57,990
government, take a role in the media
and getting the truth out there.

3176
02:46:58,050 --> 02:47:00,120
That's what we get.
That's our reward.

3177
02:47:00,390 --> 02:47:03,630
If we actually do our roles as
individuals and as a community,

3178
02:47:03,780 --> 02:47:05,850
if we don't do those things,
we don't get that.

3179
02:47:05,851 --> 02:47:07,950
It's not just gonna magically happen.
I really don't believe that.

3180
02:47:08,070 --> 02:47:11,760
I think if we don't do our parts,
we end up in a place that looks more like,

3181
02:47:12,080 --> 02:47:14,460
I kind of like total recall
version of the future.

3182
02:47:14,490 --> 02:47:17,820
People are living in small
dingy apartments and there
are cameras everywhere and

3183
02:47:18,140 --> 02:47:20,820
see secretive police pulling
people away for no reason.

3184
02:47:20,821 --> 02:47:23,880
Just total bullshit power,
power to take,

3185
02:47:23,881 --> 02:47:27,030
take back the message and take
back everything around you. I mean,

3186
02:47:27,031 --> 02:47:30,450
we built everything. Human beings are
amazing creatures. Look when we're done,

3187
02:47:30,590 --> 02:47:33,190
I mean we have the ability to
take it back. There's also the,

3188
02:47:33,260 --> 02:47:36,290
the realization that we're not going
to be human beings forever. You know,

3189
02:47:36,291 --> 02:47:38,700
just like we weren't
rats forever after the,

3190
02:47:39,030 --> 02:47:42,380
the asteroids hit 65 million years ago,
there was just like rats.

3191
02:47:42,790 --> 02:47:45,230
Now somehow or another it became
monkeys and it became people.

3192
02:47:45,410 --> 02:47:47,990
There's not going to stay people.
It's just were clinging on.

3193
02:47:47,991 --> 02:47:52,940
We're imperfect beings, clinging to our
existence. And it might be that this,

3194
02:47:52,941 --> 02:47:56,870
this symbiotic relationship we have
with technology might mean that the next

3195
02:47:56,871 --> 02:48:01,760
form of life is an artificial one IP.
That we're here to put that into reality.

3196
02:48:01,940 --> 02:48:02,880
We're here,
we're,

3197
02:48:02,980 --> 02:48:07,040
we're the bees making the hive and don't
really know why the fuck we're doing it.

3198
02:48:07,041 --> 02:48:09,800
We're the animal that
pollinates the plant, where the,

3199
02:48:09,860 --> 02:48:12,980
where the thing that starts up the
next stage of life, emotionless,

3200
02:48:13,190 --> 02:48:17,810
something that doesn't, doesn't
have ego, doesn't use resources,

3201
02:48:17,840 --> 02:48:22,730
intentionally recycles everything and
doesn't reproduce more than it needs to.

3202
02:48:23,150 --> 02:48:24,470
And that's the next stage of life.

3203
02:48:24,471 --> 02:48:28,040
And the next stage of life creates
the next and it keeps going and going.

3204
02:48:28,041 --> 02:48:29,630
And we're just all cocky and shit.

3205
02:48:29,631 --> 02:48:31,850
And we think the only kind
of life is biological life.

3206
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:35,660
And it could be that we're here to make
some new shit. And that we're just,

3207
02:48:35,661 --> 02:48:40,190
the things that stay alive until this
new thing comes online. So, and then

3208
02:48:40,400 --> 02:48:45,180
if that's the case, you congressional
Riendeau mean shit side unfortunately.

3209
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:49,620
Well it's, I mean it does. I mean it's
something for now for us it means a lot.

3210
02:48:50,130 --> 02:48:55,080
John Connor, whatever his name is. John t
toward the guy. The time traveler. Fuck.

3211
02:48:55,081 --> 02:48:57,750
This fucking show has been a
drag. I'm sorry. Not Tomorrow.

3212
02:48:57,751 --> 02:49:00,100
We're going to talk about roids.
We're going to talk about, um,

3213
02:49:00,250 --> 02:49:01,590
we were bringing in victor contact,

3214
02:49:01,700 --> 02:49:04,250
who's the guy who got era.
He got arrested,

3215
02:49:04,510 --> 02:49:08,850
went to jail for the ball coast candle,
the Barry bonds thing and all those guys.

3216
02:49:08,851 --> 02:49:13,290
He got uh, steroids. It were undetectable.
She'd be fascinating. He's going to find,

3217
02:49:13,291 --> 02:49:15,300
tell us how many different
people are cheating in sports.

3218
02:49:15,450 --> 02:49:17,690
Apparently it's everybody
apparently like you.

3219
02:49:17,691 --> 02:49:20,790
You can't be a high level athlete unless
you're doing something that's funky.

3220
02:49:20,970 --> 02:49:23,370
If everyone's cheating, that doesn't
that mean like nobody's cheating?

3221
02:49:23,660 --> 02:49:25,410
I guess what I've always wondered,
just stuff like that.

3222
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:26,940
I don't think it's everybody.
I think I'm exaggerating.

3223
02:49:27,210 --> 02:49:31,050
I think it's 80% of the people. But you
know, a lot of them are the best people.

3224
02:49:31,170 --> 02:49:34,170
I mean, this Lance Armstrong
thing, it's pretty crazy. You know,

3225
02:49:34,200 --> 02:49:35,190
at what point in time,
I mean,

3226
02:49:35,191 --> 02:49:38,130
how many different people you have
to get busted before you go, Hey,

3227
02:49:38,131 --> 02:49:40,190
are you guys all on that? Just
tell me the truth. Why did,

3228
02:49:40,191 --> 02:49:42,870
why did they wait this long as a
foreigner to attack a national hero?

3229
02:49:43,080 --> 02:49:45,060
They built this guy up and now
they have to tear him down.

3230
02:49:45,110 --> 02:49:47,640
I don't think they should have been done
after the second when I to do that with

3231
02:49:47,641 --> 02:49:50,880
helps to just over pot. No,
they didn't. No they didn't.

3232
02:49:50,881 --> 02:49:55,860
They never tried to prosecute him as
lost his living man. This is a big,

3233
02:49:55,861 --> 02:49:58,860
big difference. The witch hunt,
they're trying to take away his titles.

3234
02:49:58,861 --> 02:50:02,640
They've stripped him of, you know, all of
his Tour de France wins and apparently,

3235
02:50:02,641 --> 02:50:03,030
you know,
the,

3236
02:50:03,030 --> 02:50:06,810
it's American doping society
or anti-doping society
that's doing it or whatever

3237
02:50:06,811 --> 02:50:10,380
the fuck the name of their organization
is, their DEA, whatever it is, mad,

3238
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:13,380
whatever it is. They, I
mean, they don't even,

3239
02:50:13,400 --> 02:50:16,320
they don't have the right to take it
away. It's not, they didn't award it.

3240
02:50:16,710 --> 02:50:20,130
I wonder what's going on with that. He
did something to somebody, you know,

3241
02:50:20,131 --> 02:50:22,770
maybe someone was like big Sheryl crow
fan and when he started banging Sheryl

3242
02:50:22,771 --> 02:50:27,600
crow like that's it. This motherfucker,
he's going down one ball and all.

3243
02:50:28,230 --> 02:50:30,450
They can take him down. They
can take anyone down. Yeah.

3244
02:50:30,451 --> 02:50:34,200
Well it sounds like he was cheating on
me and I'm not saying you shouldn't do it

3245
02:50:34,201 --> 02:50:35,490
because it seems like
everybody was doing it,

3246
02:50:35,491 --> 02:50:38,650
but it seems like everybody was doing
it. I mean, I don't know. Don't know.

3247
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:41,820
I don't know. But the, the guys
passed a bunch of drug tests.

3248
02:50:41,821 --> 02:50:44,310
It seems to me that you're wasting a
lot of money going after some guy just

3249
02:50:44,311 --> 02:50:47,760
because a bunch of people said he did
some things and you got all these drug

3250
02:50:47,761 --> 02:50:51,240
tests that he passed. Could you imagine
if that was like with you at work?

3251
02:50:51,360 --> 02:50:53,580
You know, I fucking know David
Seaman's smoked weed, man.

3252
02:50:53,670 --> 02:50:55,800
We took the cleanse together.
You're like this son of a bitch.

3253
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:59,880
This guy tested positive and you tested
negative and they'll go after you for

3254
02:50:59,881 --> 02:51:02,580
years and years and years after
you've already quit ups. I mean,

3255
02:51:02,581 --> 02:51:03,540
that's really what's going on.

3256
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:06,540
He doesn't ride bikes anymore and they're
fucking still dragging this guy out of

3257
02:51:06,541 --> 02:51:10,860
jail or in the court rather. And they
finally, he's just quitting. I don't know.

3258
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:13,620
But apparently we're gonna find
out tomorrow. Don't do that.

3259
02:51:14,810 --> 02:51:16,230
Stop confusing the shit out of me.

3260
02:51:16,770 --> 02:51:19,400
We're going to find out tomorrow
from Victor Conte, he's gonna,

3261
02:51:19,410 --> 02:51:20,250
he's gonna let us know.

3262
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:23,640
And apparently there's a lot of different
ways to do it where it's not dangerous.

3263
02:51:23,641 --> 02:51:26,490
You can elevate your levels
of testosterone and all
these different substances

3264
02:51:26,730 --> 02:51:29,810
legally and healthily. He's going
to show us that to just get subs.

3265
02:51:29,810 --> 02:51:32,310
He sells stuff like Zma, zinc, magnesium,

3266
02:51:32,311 --> 02:51:35,010
zinc and magnesium supposed to up
your testosterone. I need that.

3267
02:51:35,370 --> 02:51:37,410
We all need that. Listen,
Ladies and gentlemen,

3268
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:38,640
thank you very much for coming here.

3269
02:51:38,670 --> 02:51:40,740
We have to have one with
just you and low alone.

3270
02:51:40,741 --> 02:51:43,510
We had a little bit of a scheduling
issue, Abby. So next time we'll do it.

3271
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:46,290
Just you. Is that sound? Good. And we'll
do that. November. Yeah. Do that. Okay.

3272
02:51:46,291 --> 02:51:47,550
We'll do that. I remember. And Dude,

3273
02:51:47,580 --> 02:51:50,730
anytime you want to come back by yourself
to please you guys do on my mind.

3274
02:51:50,731 --> 02:51:51,600
Sometimes I would love to.

3275
02:51:51,601 --> 02:51:54,760
Do you Skype it or do you do it live
or we could do a live before I leave

3276
02:51:55,010 --> 02:51:56,960
California. When are you
leaving? Well, let's talk about,

3277
02:51:57,040 --> 02:52:02,000
let's talk after this at
fall. Abby Martin, Abby Martin
on Twitter. Uh, what is it?

3278
02:52:02,001 --> 02:52:06,060
The underscore seaman deep sea fuck heads.

3279
02:52:07,340 --> 02:52:10,600
He a man.
And if they want to go online,

3280
02:52:10,810 --> 02:52:14,320
it's David Seaman for Congress and they
can sign up to do like volunteer David

3281
02:52:14,320 --> 02:52:14,760
Seaman for Congress,

3282
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:17,710
[inaudible] dot com.com.com and
they can sign up and volunteer,

3283
02:52:17,711 --> 02:52:21,520
donate or just learn more information
about what to do and stay posted folks,

3284
02:52:21,521 --> 02:52:22,520
because we're gonna,

3285
02:52:22,540 --> 02:52:27,370
we're gonna keep having guys like David
on and guys and gals rather like Abby on.

3286
02:52:27,371 --> 02:52:30,760
And you know, there's a lot
of things that I didn't know.

3287
02:52:30,780 --> 02:52:31,571
There was a lot of things.

3288
02:52:31,571 --> 02:52:34,240
I'm sure you didn't know either about
the way this world works and the more it

3289
02:52:34,241 --> 02:52:38,110
gets exposed, the less they can
keep doing it. It's nonsense.

3290
02:52:38,111 --> 02:52:42,340
We live in a fucking co raising world,
but if it wasn't for guys like you,

3291
02:52:42,690 --> 02:52:45,250
most people wouldn't know about it really.
So thank you very much for coming on.

3292
02:52:45,251 --> 02:52:47,560
Thank you very much for doing what
you're doing and you're showing our tea.

3293

set. Just check that out on youtube.

It's all archived on there. There

3310
02:53:53,831 --> 02:53:58,390
We had a desk squad show here tomorrow
night at the Ice House comedy club.

3311
02:53:58,630 --> 02:54:03,100
It will be me, Greg Fitzsimmons
just had to back out of it.

3312
02:54:03,101 --> 02:54:07,520
He's going to some other place, I
forget where he's gone. Um, but Edwards,

3313
02:54:07,780 --> 02:54:08,880
Ian Edwards is going to be here.

3314
02:54:08,910 --> 02:54:12,730
Duncan Trussell of course Brian red
band and I will probably call some other

3315
02:54:12,731 --> 02:54:14,140
friends and have them come by as well.

3316
02:54:14,350 --> 02:54:16,690
It's always a good time here
at the Ice House in Pasadena.

3317
02:54:16,720 --> 02:54:20,470
It's only 15 bucks and it's 10 o'clock
on Wednesday. All right. Fucking freaks.

3318
02:54:20,471 --> 02:54:22,420
We'll see you tomorrow.
And then we got another one.

3319
02:54:22,421 --> 02:54:25,870
Tim Pools coming in on Thursday. Shit.
It's going to be crazy. All right.

3320
02:54:25,871 --> 02:54:28,230
