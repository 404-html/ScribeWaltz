1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,230
Her low freak bitches about um,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,800
these Nazi furries like Neo Nazi furries.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,440
Well,

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,440
the absurd obscure a subculture of
furries has a problem with mean any,

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,070
any groups of sexual
abuse and a lot of Nazi,

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,581
I mean,

7
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:22,110
cut the fucking shit.

8
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:24,120
Please just please cut the shit.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,020
Please,

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,590
please.

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,191
I can't,

12
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:27,270
I can't keep going.

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,373
I can't,

14
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,370
I can't keep going.

15
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:30,630
It's just too crazy.

16
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,020
Every day it's more
and more fucking weird.

17
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,270
This stuff I can get,

18
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,140
I think this is the same people that
watch those youtube videos or make the

19
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:40,980
youtube videos.

20
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,110
I think the people who
make the youtube videos,

21
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:43,351
dude,

22
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:44,600
I think it's just like they're,

23
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,730
they're in Asia or somewhere like that
and they have a script and they just keep

24
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:50,730
throwing the script over and over and
we're looking for like hidden messages in

25
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,550
the script.

26
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,100
I think the script is
probably just fucked up.

27
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,460
They think it's fucked up to have a
cartoon character hit himself in the head

28
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:58,320
with a bottle and I think
you're probably right.

29
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:01,230
Like maybe these fucking child predators,

30
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,570
maybe they communicate on all
sorts of different websites.

31
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,710
Maybe they just decide like,

32
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:04,891
hey,

33
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:09,420
let's meet on this tire forum and we'll
just say things in code and attire means

34
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:09,890
this.

35
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,011
I mean,

36
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:11,730
it wasn't that always
the shit with pizza gate,

37
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,650
like they thought that
they were talking in code.

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,670
Like all the conspiracy theorists thought
that a slice of pizza meant like a kid

39
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:18,570
and the youtube one,

40
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:22,830
I mean them being there being so many of
them sort of says that there's money in

41
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:23,410
it.

42
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,370
They've tapped into the algorithm
and they're just beating it to death.

43
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:26,671
Yeah,

44
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,820
and they just have the same script and
they just do it with a computer change.

45
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:30,440
One little thing,

46
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,430
a little thing here and there
and that's what I think it is.

47
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,260
I think it's not as nefarious
as everybody likes to thank,

48
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:39,090
but it's really fucking weird to keep
seeing the same video playing out over and

49
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:41,880
over again with a bottle flies through
the hair and the baby gets hit in the

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,720
fucking head.

51
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,553
And utilities,

52
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,220
I think the activity was a little weird
or when it's people actually people

53
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:47,770
doing it,

54
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,440
you can't just grab a computer,

55
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:50,790
make it to where people are.

56
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:51,900
God damn nuts.

57
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,370
They're nuts and they're out there.

58
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,430
I like furries.

59
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:54,780
Uh,

60
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,130
I get that.

61
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,300
I have a bunch of outfits that I make
videos with and stuff and that's pretty

62
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:00,991
much what that is.

63
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,700
That's just ice ugly cross play.

64
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,140
Like a role play.

65
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:04,540
Yeah.

66
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,820
They're having fun yet having fun.

67
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,220
They don't feel like normies right,

68
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,530
I say,

69
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,220
right?

70
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:09,600
Yeah.

71
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,640
And I'm sure having sex like that,

72
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,110
it's probably fine.

73
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,801
That's Kinky.

74
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:14,041
Like,

75
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:14,371
hey,

76
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:17,040
you're dressed up as my
pretty pony and I'm Spiderman.

77
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,313
Yeah.

78
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,740
Probably a lot of that.

79
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,640
A lot of dude on dude crime
other wearing these hats.

80
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,430
They're wearing fucking weird animal hats
and their bone in each other and hey,

81
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,140
why not man be know why?

82
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,340
Because this is crazy.

83
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,330
So why not?

84
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,740
Why to do it?

85
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,700
Why not do it?

86
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,061
See,

87
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:39,510
look at that.

88
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,050
Just like a Fox and your fucking each
other in a fox is fucking the chicken.

89
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,093
Why not?

90
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:44,670
Why?

91
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,151
Really?

92
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:45,720
Why not?

93
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,110
I just,

94
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,441
I don't know.

95
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:46,831
Why not?

96
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:47,431
I can't tell you.

97
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:47,970
Why not.

98
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,970
Why is it okay that people were crazy
fake eyelashes and extensions in their

99
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:59,290
hair and they pumped fat into their ass
and put silicone bags and their tits?

100
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,250
Why is that okay,

101
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,130
but it's not okay to dress like a big
chicken and get fucked by a big rooster.

102
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,183
Why isn't it,

103
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,000
why can't you pretend to be
like a fox in the hen house,

104
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,280
right?

105
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,910
Why not?

106
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,070
Like if as long as everybody agrees,

107
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:12,641
like,

108
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:13,690
do you agree to be the Fox?

109
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,080
Okay,

110
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,913
cool.

111
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,210
I want me to pull the dog.

112
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,040
I'm going to be the bulldog mascot,

113
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,660
the big bulldog head
and we're going to bone.

114
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,503
They're going to make some,

115
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,690
some Ron Davis.

116
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,553
Why the fuck not

117
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,280
have you seen the movie?

118
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,350
I hadn't,

119
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,980
it wouldn't work down during the movie.

120
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,470
I still didn't like him during the movie.

121
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,783
They asked him,

122
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,163
they asked him.

123
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,030
Do you have any,

124
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,590
uh,

125
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:34,931
uh,

126
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:39,460
good recollections of when you see
t growing up when he's trying to,

127
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,110
do you have any fond
recollections of you and cts?

128
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,460
You know,

129
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,910
as a kid and I,

130
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:45,290
boy,

131
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,750
I was looking at them jobs
waiting now where I really,

132
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,170
I really want to hear if he was
going to fabricate something,

133
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:51,630
right?

134
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,850
Because I didn't have man.

135
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,520
And I'm like,

136
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:53,840
oh,

137
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,200
I want to see with this month are going
to say that this questionnaire and he

138
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:58,220
didn't have anything.

139
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,181
And I was like,

140
00:03:59,181 --> 00:03:59,810
okay,

141
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,260
cool.

142
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:00,640
You know,

143
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,473
a loans.

144
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,290
But I was ready to stop the fucking
movie and just make an ass out of myself.

145
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:06,741
And like,

146
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:07,160
no,

147
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,911
that's bull shit.

148
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:08,390
We ain't mad.

149
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,750
You ain't one fucking time that we
ever did anything pleasurable together,

150
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,760
motherfucker and was very go off.

151
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,110
But he didn't have any.

152
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,640
So when he didn't have any files,

153
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:16,890
okay.

154
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,070
Now that's the same recollection
that I hadn't done it,

155
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,960
but I really didn't forgive him
until this last heart attack in June.

156
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,920
And what happened then when I had the
heart attack in June and it seemed like,

157
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,200
uh,

158
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,650
uh,

159
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:29,781
uh,

160
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:31,970
revelation came to me and he was like,

161
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,030
I'm,

162
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,520
it's not hurting him.

163
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,590
It's not hurting him at all.

164
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:38,420
My Dad is 86 years old.

165
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,501
He's fine,

166
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:39,891
man.

167
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:40,091
He,

168
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:40,311
he's,

169
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:40,671
he's,

170
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:41,150
he's,

171
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,870
I don't,

172
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,351
he's like,

173
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:42,531
well,

174
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:42,890
you know,

175
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:47,160
I don't think he thinks that he
has anything to be sorry for that.

176
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:47,961
I think he thinks he's,

177
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:50,330
he's done a fantastic job of raising me.

178
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,141
And,

179
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:51,560
uh,

180
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,080
I was just waiting on the policy
who was never going to come,

181
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:54,800
but I,

182
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,670
but it was still that hate that
I have for him was eating me up.

183
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,040
I had to get that burden off me.

184
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,450
And I think having that labs harder,

185
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:06,740
I didn't want to die carrying that
burden with me of hating my dad.

186
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,550
So I went to my dad and I
asked him to forgive me.

187
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,043
Whoa.

188
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,913
Yeah.

189
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,563
Damn.

190
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,470
Yeah.

191
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,370
How did you say that?

192
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:16,850
What did you,

193
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,683
what did you say?

194
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,201
I said,

195
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:18,471
you know,

196
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:18,750
look,

197
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,100
Dad,

198
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,660
I have blamed you.

199
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,560
I told him that I had recently had a
heart attack and I have blamed you my

200
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:28,970
entire life for a whole lot of things
that went bad or when you know that I

201
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:30,690
always blamed you fix and,

202
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:30,951
and,

203
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:31,200
um,

204
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,750
and I'm sorry.

205
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:33,840
Uh,

206
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,790
know I don't,

207
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,121
you know,

208
00:05:35,121 --> 00:05:37,070
I don't want to blame me for that anymore.

209
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,210
And would you please forgive me
for carrying this against you from,

210
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,501
you know,

211
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:43,400
my whole life.

212
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,661
I don't want to die,

213
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:45,494
you know,

214
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,330
letting you think that you know,

215
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
I love you man,

216
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,880
and I want you to know that.

217
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,020
Wow.

218
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,853
Yeah.

219
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,170
How good does that feel?

220
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,723
I can't,

221
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,200
I don't wake up punching,

222
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,163
see any anymore.

223
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,120
I probably be out of
breath if I date anyway,

224
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,450
but I don't wake up with those night.

225
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,670
I haven't had that nightmare since then.

226
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,750
Wow.

227
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,080
Yeah.

228
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,220
How did he react to that?

229
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:07,790
He was,

230
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,510
he was a fully accepting of my iPod.

231
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,771
Pete grace me,

232
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:13,010
you know,

233
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,390
he was graciously accepted.

234
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,230
My apology.

235
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,250
So yeah,

236
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,730
because I have zero
musical talent or zero.

237
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,860
Have you ever tried to actually
hold a tune trying to just try this,

238
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,360
try to sing all serious.

239
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:25,194
Don't laugh.

240
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:25,810
Try to sync.

241
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,281
Just look at me.

242
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:27,030
It's embarrassing.

243
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:27,720
But do it.

244
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,553
Try to sing.

245
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,600
I won't sing silent night.

246
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,410
Holy night.

247
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,630
Try to hit it then do it right
and then I'm going to try it.

248
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:34,464
It's so hard.

249
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,093
So nervous.

250
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,810
It's so vulnerable.

251
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,130
I'm asking you to think two verses,

252
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:43,920
but isn't it funny that like
making noises with your mouth?

253
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,980
It's vital?

254
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,823
Nah.

255
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,110
Oh really?

256
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,810
It's not bad.

257
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,720
Oh,

258
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:57,290
this

259
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,290
copy that was spring.

260
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,143
Can you get a little power?

261
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,180
Oh,

262
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,750
where's Bra

263
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,570
drought?

264
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,370
What's the rest?

265
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,170
I don't know.

266
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,120
Thinking heavenly peace.

267
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,081
Holy infant.

268
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:17,914
So tender and mild.

269
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,640
Oh,

270
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,513
so,

271
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,670
eh,

272
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,540
when the PE,

273
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,410
I went immediately to the dish bag,

274
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:39,570
singer voice that whispery I know,

275
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,970
but you,

276
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,040
but you know what you had on tuned.

277
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:44,730
Do I think you were,

278
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,451
he was tuned,

279
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:46,030
wasn't he?

280
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,170
Yeah.

281
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:46,250
Yeah.

282
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,630
You know what I used to do two though.

283
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,460
I only,

284
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:51,730
I only told Collin Quinn distillery.

285
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,760
Oh,

286
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,430
when I grew up in these apartments,

287
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,750
Pembrook apartments in
Prince George's county,

288
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:57,584
Maryland,

289
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,000
there was this one bullied,

290
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,390
uh,

291
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,300
who would steal people's bikes and shit
and he would start fights and whatever.

292
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,863
And so I had,

293
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,730
I played sports,

294
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:04,851
I,

295
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,151
you know,

296
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:10,151
so one of my trophies broke and my
mom took me to some place to fix it.

297
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:13,850
And I did not know that there was a
place that existed when I just thought

298
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:14,960
trophies appeared.

299
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:15,120
You know,

300
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,291
I mean,

301
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,390
as a kid you just get shot,

302
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,000
right.

303
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,320
So when I saw this was the spot,

304
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,940
what I used to do,

305
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,440
because I was saving my allowance and I
would go to the trophy spot and buy like

306
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,460
a karate trophy,

307
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,600
just walk around the neighborhood just
long enough for this one dude to see me

308
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,610
who I knew would be like the town crier.

309
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,650
And I would always act
embarrassed about it.

310
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:36,830
Like,

311
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:36,951
Oh,

312
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:37,790
you don't understand yet.

313
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,991
And that's how we talk.

314
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:39,824
We say young and stuff.

315
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,620
And then when my mother got
me taking karate and shit,

316
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:43,400
I'm wanting to stay with them.

317
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:43,551
Oh,

318
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:43,770
you,

319
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,260
you wanna cry you nights like that.

320
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,750
Don't tell nobody,

321
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:48,050
man,

322
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,890
I ain't gonna say shit.

323
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:49,724
And then I would see.

324
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,540
So then,

325
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,373
uh,

326
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,223
and then like,

327
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,511
you know,

328
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:54,440
a couple of months ago by,

329
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:55,800
I go by and by a little bigger too.

330
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,010
Dude never messed with me.

331
00:08:59,011 --> 00:08:59,731
He never met.

332
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:00,181
Thank God.

333
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:00,961
Thank God.

334
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:01,650
No one was like,

335
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:01,891
oh,

336
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:02,400
I could fight,

337
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,100
but I did.

338
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,571
You know what I'm saying?

339
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:08,571
But it was like the word got out enough
because nobody knew what I'm saying.

340
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,830
Like if you heard a d
a Dude Dicker Ronnie,

341
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:11,670
that was enough.

342
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,470
Like you didn't want to get embarrassed.

343
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,540
So he gave me like free passage to do,

344
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,190
to be my corny self be out.

345
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,024
You know?

346
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,130
That's a very clever way of handling it.

347
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:25,680
That's what I did when I saw that store.

348
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,573
I was like,

349
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,030
and this the piece of whom
they would like five bucks,

350
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:30,481
seven bucks,

351
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:30,841
three bucks,

352
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:32,070
and then we'll go put it on,

353
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,800
and then someone was
acting at an early age.

354
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:35,634
There's all of that shit.

355
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:36,931
I said,

356
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:37,790
I know where he going to be.

357
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,031
As soon as he saw me,

358
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:39,740
I'd go back and I also,

359
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,860
I didn't want him like a big,

360
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,670
you know what I mean?

361
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,800
That's very clever.

362
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,860
Okay.
