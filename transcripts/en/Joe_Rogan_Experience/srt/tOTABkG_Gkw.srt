1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,120
Store just lip singing songs and he 
played drums.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,650
Yeah,
he would play really good.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,940
You'd pull the chairs up and jumps two 
drumsticks and start playing to chairs 

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,020
and it was good.
Music is really good and it would just 

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,240
go on as long as there was one person in
the audience,

6
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:18,330
they will keep going so it lasts for.
I'd be like,

7
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:19,560
alright,
I bet it's 2:00

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,560
AM.
I got to go and then I'd stay there for 

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:24,560
another hour and a half.
Yeah.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,660
You know,
all the problems that we talked about 

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:27,660
with the comedy store and all the,
you know,

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:27,930
the issues they have or how it's being 
run.

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,380
At the end of the day,
that place is like one of the weirdest 

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,711
spots ever for like cool development of 
comedy is one of the best spots ever in 

15
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:38,760
the country.
As dark as it is.

16
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:42,210
There is that element of creativity and 
excitement there.

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,280
There's something,
there's a weird sort of a community and 

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,780
a commodity like Tammy Presca Deli 
posted something on twitter today,

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,080
like a comedy store gang.
All her friends from the comedy store 

20
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,080
and starts,
you know,

21
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,100
putting all these people's twitter 
handles together and I remember one time

22
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:58,950
me and Brent did a show in Florida and 
printer.

23
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:03,951
It's just slade and he got offstage and 
as he was coming up to me when comedies 

24
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:07,470
to a motherfucker and like knuckles,
like they have that,

25
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:12,471
you know,
there's so many good comics that have 

26
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:13,890
come out of there and they have that 
disease history to that,

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,780
like being a marine or something.
Yeah.

28
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,890
There's something.
It's undeniable miserable and we love 

29
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:20,890
it.
Yeah.

30
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,710
They just need to clean that place up.
Get rid of ever going back,

31
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:25,630
get rid of some shitty baggage in human 
form.

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,950
The spot itself is fantastic.

33
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,350
Yeah.
It's one of the most historical spots in

34
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,120
the world of comedy.
I mean,

35
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:38,121
it's probably the.
If you thought you stopped to think 

36
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:40,551
about it,
what is the most historically important 

37
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:40,830
stop in the world of standup comedy 
that's still around?

38
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,670
I'd say it's the comedy store.
I would say it's the comedy store to 

39
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,340
prior film live that sunset strip there.
Is there anything in New York that 

40
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,370
really counts?
I don't think anything's left.

41
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:51,240
I think he did.
Was that.

42
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,200
When did he film it?
There was of the roxy.

43
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,350
The Roxy was Kennison.
I want to.

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,500
I want to say that he filmed live.
One of them at least he filmed at the 

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,210
comedy store in the main room.
Remember the background?

46
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,290
Yeah,
I think.

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,320
I think that was it.
I think I'm pretty sure that was it and 

48
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,811
that was prior when he was just the 
greatest stand up to ever walk the face 

49
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:12,480
of the planet.

50
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,840
He was the number one guy,
which in my eyes what I have to rank 

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,470
like the all time guys.
He's always number one prior.

52
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,720
Yeah,
I feel like priors,

53
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,200
number one,
I think.

54
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:27,201
I think Kennison in 86 was as funny as 
any living human being ever has been or 

55
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,490
ever will be and it always makes you 
laugh.

56
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,480
Yeah.
It's never like,

57
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,340
oh good for him.
Oh very clever.

58
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:36,030
It's like he was the best for like two 
years,

59
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,270
but then coke just took its toll coke 
and booze and just fucking drinking 

60
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,771
bottles of vodka.
And we had Aaron on the show and Marion 

61
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:48,561
was telling us this story of,
I've heard some of them out with 

62
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:51,710
Kennison after doing coke for like three
days in a row with no sleep and how it 

63
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,940
like for years fucked with his head,
like he said for a whole year,

64
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,430
like he heard voices in his head like a 
hole.

65
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:59,310
You can you imagine

66
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,920
having that kind of memory of Kennison 
yelling your name at you.

67
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,980
And they were always locking each other 
out of the house and fucking with

68
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,670
Saki about psychosis words in his head.
He was having,

69
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:13,460
like people were talking to him that 
weren't really there like he was.

70
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,540
He was hearing things because of the 
fact that he just red line his brain 

71
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,880
hanging out with kids for like x amount 
of years.

72
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:23,360
And he's a young guy to the point where 
you're going to get out of town.

73
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,850
Yeah.
It drove kinison drove him out of town.

74
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,760
Well his,
his fucking story about hanging out with

75
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:33,761
Kinison is what?
One of the greatest all time Hollywood 

76
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:33,761
party stories.
The way merit tells it.

77
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:38,551
It was from,
if I don't remember what number of 

78
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:38,551
podcast it was,
but God damn it was good.

79
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,260
It's such a good story.
It's such a good story and such a.

80
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,390
When you stop and think about that,
like the history of standup comedy,

81
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:49,391
like one of the most epic things was the
comedy store explosion with Kennison and

82
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:54,731
the in the late eighties because it 
became like everybody recognized that 

83
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:58,691
there was this one spot we're kennison 
developed in Hollywood and this is the 

84
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,280
same spot where prior came out of and 
David Letterman came out of it.

85
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:04,190
All these other people came out of it 
like it put the spot,

86
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,870
like it became like an even bigger spot 
in the mind of like standup comedy.

87
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,960
You don't really hear that about.
The improv was always a great club.

88
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,410
Still a great club,
but that places a nuthouse yeah.

89
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,190
Comedy store is always has been a 
nuthouse.

90
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,260
It's crazy place.
Yeah.

91
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,010
I heard Schubert telling some story 
about how he took kinison offstage on a 

92
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,631
motorcycle one time.
How fucking awesome is that and I don't 

93
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:33,841
know how that's possible,
but he told the fucking store and we 

94
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,720
went through that back hallway,
said that was so hilarious and like can 

95
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,790
I think kinison told them to do it,
but then you said kinison seemed pretty 

96
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:41,790
scared when they were doing it.
Yeah,

97
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,741
I'm sure that's a shitty way to break 
your leg twice a risk because you can 

98
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:48,340
see out the window.
Yeah.

99
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,130
If you fall,
you could ruin a good set.

100
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,020
Yeah.
It's interesting that there's a,

101
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,910
there's no spots like that left in New 
York.

102
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,350
Like there's a new spot,
you know,

103
00:04:56,351 --> 00:05:01,351
the comedy cellar is like the new spots 
and there's carolines which was always 

104
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,460
like a big headliner club,
but as far as like a development club,

105
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,590
like the store,
there's really nothing left.

106
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,030
There's something in Queens called the 
creek and the cave,

107
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,060
which isn't quite the same thing,
but there's comedy there every nights 

108
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,260
and people can do it.
The only problem is there's no real 

109
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,971
audience,
but there's like three or four shows a 

110
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:19,340
night and you can just hang out there 
and fuck around on stage,

111
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,510
but how long has it been around?

112
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,360
Long at all,
but that's what I'm saying.

113
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:27,361
It's like these weird things like the 
store is one of the weirdest places 

114
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,440
because it's a place that's still around
and still in the same form.

115
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,680
Like the way the shows are set up,
it started eight artists goes on at 

116
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,230
8:30,
you know the show goes on throughout the

117
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:36,670
day.
Everybody tag teams,

118
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,340
it's an 8:00
PM to 2:00

119
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,740
AM show every night and that's just what
it is.

120
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,050
Like there's no other places that are 
rocking it like that.

121
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,110
Yeah,
like how many places are left that are 

122
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,110
running it like that?
I think it's the only one.

123
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,930
I think you're right.
I think there's very few other ones.

124
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:54,931
I mean there's some organized shows and 
there's a main room shows that coincide 

125
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:59,131
with the or shows that are organized,
but at the end of the day that that's a 

126
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:02,510
weird club because it exists back like 
the clubs used to exist in the hay day.

127
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,030
Yeah.
It's still running the same way and even

128
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,420
running more free than any of the other 
clubs ever ran like that.

129
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,100
Yeah,
like the tag team thing.

130
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,510
Who the fuck else?
Tag Teams.

131
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,060
Is there another club in the whole 
country that's known for only having tag

132
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:16,850
teams?
Nobody that's known for it.

133
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,970
I've only ever seen it.
Comedy magic does it.

134
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,460
They'll do it occasionally,
but it's not their thing.

135
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,250
Yeah.
They'll also have an MC with comedy.

136
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,010
Magic is the weirdest one ever because 
they always have a magician on the show.

137
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,250
Yeah.
You know the fan.

138
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,500
I'm not crazy about it.
Definitely don't like following it.

139
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:34,860
That's for fucking sure.
Will.

140
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,250
Does it feel like you have to restart 
the crowd when you follow it?

141
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,740
I feel like all they want is magic after
that.

142
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:41,870
Yeah.
Definitely have to restart your jokes.

143
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:44,330
Just not as impressive as disappearing 
doves.

144
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,410
Yeah,
I've won.

145
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,430
I always say I should learn to juggle or
learned one trick just for situations 

146
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,560
like that.
Yeah.

147
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,200
Music acts are the hardest,
right?

148
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,340
Use It gags.
Yeah.

149
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:56,000
You have to follow music.
Acts like God damn.

150
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:59,180
Especially if they're good.
So much energy in music.

151
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,390
Yeah.
I was just gonna say I was thinking that

152
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:03,330
when went to see,
um,

153
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,020
went to the um,
uh,

154
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,780
hard rock in Vegas.
Yeah.

155
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,890
House of Blues Rather in Vegas and saw 
steel panthers.

156
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,530
I saw that same place.
I was blown away.

157
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:13,820
Did you like it?
Incredible.

158
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,150
I was so surprised at how funny it was.
I thought they were just,

159
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,030
I was going to be laughing at poisoned 
songs.

160
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,260
They were so fucking funny.
No,

161
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:22,970
it's really good.
It's a really good show.

162
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,350
A,
it's like they're really good musicians 

163
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:28,350
to.
Yeah.

164
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:28,820
And it's funny and it's like the music 
is really good,

165
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:33,821
but there was one time where he was 
doing this ozzy osborne impression and 

166
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:34,910
his eyes,
he impression is so fucking good.

167
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,090
So I'm laughing like really hard at how 
good is Ozzie impressionists and I'm 

168
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:40,700
going,
God damn,

169
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,380
this is like,
they're nailing it,

170
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,590
right?
I mean they,

171
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:45,440
they,
they were fucking nailing it.

172
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,280
He was doing crazy train and I mean it 
was incredible how good it was.

173
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:52,730
It sounded like he was moving like Ozzie
and I was sitting there thinking like,

174
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:55,310
what am amazing amount of power music?
I was like,

175
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:57,440
imagine if I had to go on after that 
until a joke.

176
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,690
No Way.
Fuck it.

177
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,090
Fucking suck for at least 10 minutes.
Yeah,

178
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:03,230
you're fucked.
You're fucked.

179
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,750
You could try it and start off with 
some.

180
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:10,751
Like,
you better jump on them right away also 

181
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,110
because now their attention span is for 
ready,

182
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:14,150
set.
Go like perfect,

183
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:19,151
smooth,
exciting beats rehearsed music over and 

184
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,540
over.
No,

185
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:20,890
no,
no,

186
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,250
no,
no,

187
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,850
no,
no,

188
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,580
no.
What?

189
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:27,581
I mean it's all perfect and it's all 
like powerful and different and 

190
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:31,481
completely different kind of tone than 
you setting up a joke and being 

191
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:34,811
conversational,
trying to draw them into the way you're 

192
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:34,811
thinking about things.

193
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:38,080
What's up with Ikea?
I know men and women are different.

194
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,870
I even,
I had,

195
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,680
I opened a show for Brandon Flowers,
the killers,

196
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:46,190
you know,
this band,

197
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:48,320
the killers,
I've heard the band before,

198
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,350
he had a solo tour and they had me open 
the show at the troubadour and that was 

199
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,890
one of the worst experiences in my life 
and that was just opening.

200
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,330
But at a music show they don't even 
introduce you.

201
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,100
They're like,
go up there and introduce yourself,

202
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,060
you know?
Yeah.

203
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,890
I've only opened up for a couple of 
bands.

204
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,050
I opened up for Bon Jovi.
Really?

205
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,160
Yeah.
That was,

206
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,050
that was,
I was terrible.

207
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,140
Was it?
I deserved whatever I deserved them to 

208
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,140
think.
I was funny.

209
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,750
I wasn't very good,
but it was uh,

210
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,180
was also so strange because it was in a 
theater in a round.

211
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,090
It was the kid I was on stage with all 
their equipment,

212
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,620
so I had to like move around these drums
and try to tell a standup and I was not 

213
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:31,490
really used to doing standup and places 
any other than a comedy club.

214
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,810
I'd only been doing it like a couple of 
years when this had happened.

215
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,230
So there's no way I should have been 
like opening up for a big band.

216
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:37,830
Right?
No,

217
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:38,480
that's,
that's a,

218
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,140
that's a tall order.
Yeah.

219
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:45,141
I had some weird deal with MTV.
So they offered it to me and like a 

220
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:46,230
greedy little bitch.
He doesn't know his place.

221
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,180
Accepted.
Yeah.

222
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,170
Well you have to.
You have to.

223
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,490
And so there was people behind.
You either walk around someplace in.

224
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,530
It was either Brooklyn or Queens,
I don't remember,

225
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,590
but it was weird.
New York bands use of e-cigarettes and 

226
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:00,750
public.
Isn't that crazy?

227
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,360
What?
Forty three day eight.

228
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,980
You're no longer allowed to blow out 
fake smoke.

229
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,520
And that is ignorant.
That's ignorant of what that is.

230
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:13,080
That's really stupid.
That's just vapor.

231
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:15,060
It's water vapor mean.
It's not.

232
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,520
It's not toxic.
It doesn't smell bad.

233
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,290
It doesn't anything.
Well,

234
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,510
I don't know why it exists though,
that maybe that's a good point.

235
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:26,590
Like why?
Why can't you make a vaporizer that 

236
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,000
doesn't make smoke like that?
I think you can.

237
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,730
That's all part of the fun.
Is that what it is?

238
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,700
Probably smokers want to say it.
Probably most likely otherwise,

239
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,490
if you can't smell it and he can't see 
it,

240
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,780
then what are you doing?
Dude?

241
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:41,781
I went to a restaurant the other night.
I went to a restaurant the other night 

242
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:42,210
and there was this lady on the patio 
that was smoking and uh,

243
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
you know,
it wasn't that she was smoking outside.

244
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:49,161
She has every right to smoke outside of 
a restaurant if they have an ash tray 

245
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:49,161
there,
if it's legal in the town,

246
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:52,830
it's that she was putting out our 
cigarettes in this plant and you know,

247
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,000
we went out there afterwards and I was 
talking with my wife saying,

248
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,810
do you think that she got rid of the 
cigarettes?

249
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,590
Like,
just like,

250
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,640
no,
they're going to be right there.

251
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,230
And we walked right up there.
I'm sure enough,

252
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,600
four cigarettes in writing this,
you,

253
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,150
it's a nice place to stick it in a 
plant.

254
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,400
She just decided right here,
this is where it is.

255
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,370
Like you wouldn't take your soda can and
crunch it up,

256
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
leave it there.
But for cigarettes,

257
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,290
there's a weird disconnect with 
cigarette smokers.

258
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,410
It's a fact.
They know they're doing something toxic 

259
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:21,410
to their body.
And they don't care,

260
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:21,990
so when they're done,
they're done.

261
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,050
They'll throw it on the earth.
They don't have any respect for their 

262
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,301
own body,
they don't have any respect for the 

263
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:29,301
earth.
And they always say it's biodegradable,

264
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:33,141
but how can that.
Even if it is so what it's going to 

265
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:34,940
exist for 100 years.
It'll look like that for 100 years ago.

266
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,180
Tracy talk.
Yeah.

267
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,430
It's a little foam thing.
You know how long it's going to take for

268
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,470
that to.
It doesn't rain here stupid.

269
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,320
Even if it does,
if it degrades,

270
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,150
then it's going to go into the 
environment.

271
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,740
You know it's going to become a part of 
the dirt.

272
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,080
That's not good.
That's toxic.

273
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,930
That's shitty things.
You're supposed to put it in a bag and 

274
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,931
then some supposed to pick it up and 
they put in a landfill somewhere until 

275
00:11:56,931 --> 00:11:56,931
somebody figures out how to make it into
fuel,

276
00:11:56,931 --> 00:12:01,730
you know?
But until then we got piles of places 

277
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:01,730
where we stick shit like this

278
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,080
because we don't want it just laying 
around on the ground.

279
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:06,900
It's not biodegradable fuckhead no way.
It's not.

280
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,040
Even if it is,
it's not.

281
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,910
Know even if it is,
but they all say the same thing.

282
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:13,590
They've all been given the same 
pamphlet,

283
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,120
like,
this is what you say,

284
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,670
this is why it's okay to do it.
They all believed that early.

285
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,230
Say That

286
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,380
when Duncan and I were filming the Joe 
Rogan questions,

287
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:24,330
everything show on Scifi.
We went to Utah.

288
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,400
We went to this one place.
This guy was supposed to show us 

289
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,091
something.
It was the dude was nutty and he's 

290
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:32,091
making shit up.
It was pretty obvious,

291
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:36,351
but one of the things that was weird was
that he was smoking cigarettes and I saw

292
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:37,320
him smile.
He's like,

293
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,420
oh,
it was supposed to be like this expert 

294
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:42,420
that knows this terrain and knows the 
area.

295
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,640
I see him smoking a cigarette and then 
all of a sudden he's not smoking anymore

296
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:47,490
and he doesn't have it in his hand and 
we're nowhere near garbage.

297
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,240
So I look at him and I just go,
what'd you do with your cigarette?

298
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,530
And he goes,
what do you mean?

299
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,450
I go,
what'd you do with your cigarette?

300
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,120
And he goes,
I go,

301
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,770
just throw it on the ground.
He goes,

302
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:00,310
yeah,
I did.

303
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,970
I go,
why would you throw it on the ground?

304
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,640
Go.
We're in the wilderness like,

305
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,850
like we're out here.
We're supposed to be like the stewards 

306
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,191
of the land.
This is public wildlife land and you're 

307
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:11,740
taking cigarettes out and thrown on the 
ground in front of everybody.

308
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,230
You have a pocket.
It's not like a cigarette waste.

309
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:19,231
Fifty pounds.
You can't carry it back and you'll die 

310
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,231
up here.
Put it in your fucking pocket man.

311
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,780
Like this is disgusting.
But for him it was instant.

312
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,100
It was like,
this is what you do.

313
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,200
You're done with your cigarette.
You throw it on the ground,

314
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:27,670
you step on it,
you walk on.

315
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,840
So he didn't think twice about.
I mean we're talking about beautiful 

316
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,480
land,
gorgeous landscape,

317
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,700
crazy rock formations and shit.
He doesn't think twice about throwing a 

318
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,160
cigarette onto that.
Just leaving it there.

319
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,980
Yeah,
but you wouldn't do with anything else.

320
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:44,200
That's a weird thing that people do with
cigarettes.

321
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,090
It's crazy.
It's real weird,

322
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:46,480
man.

323
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,310
Hmm.

324
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,220
It's real weird.
And it took Bill Hicks.

325
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,440
Yeah,
that's the worst part.

326
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,180
Most honestly,
most likely.

327
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,350
I mean,
maybe it was something else,

328
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,940
maybe it was genetic,
I don't know,

329
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:02,941
but I still smoked a lot.
Dean del Ray the other day and he rides 

330
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:04,300
a motorcycle and he's like,
uh,

331
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,780
the worst thing is when people flick 
their cigarettes out of the car and in a

332
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,800
year and a motorcycle and it goes right 
into your like suit,

333
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,660
like driving and you're trying to get it
out of.

334
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,660
That's a weird one anyways though.
It's like that's the whole new level and

335
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:21,100
you see that all the time.
It's like,

336
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,230
I'm just going to throw out of this car.
You don't know what happens to it.

337
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:28,000
It's only California where everything's 
dry as fuck.

338
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,880
It happens every week.
The whole fucking mountain side goes up.

339
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,690
All retards,

340
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,690
man.
We just got to get better at educating 

341
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,950
people from the jump better at educating
babies.

342
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,320
That's what we gotta do to take babies 
away from retards.

343
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,870
Giving that kid,
you're going to fuck them up.

344
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,960
He's going to be a cigarette tosser do 
you watch?

345
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,020
Obviously I say no,
but I know the controversy.

346
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:55,021
I thought it was fascinating.
I posted some from the borrower report 

347
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:55,021
today,
um,

348
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:55,040
and uh,
you know,

349
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,840
I guess a lot of people thought that it 
was real.

350
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,580
I thought it was real when I first read 
it,

351
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,990
like when I first read the title and 
then I saw it was the bar,

352
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:04,160
what's report,
but it was that Vince and Scalia defends

353
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,580
a,
um,

354
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,880
hold on a second,
I'll pull up the tweet.

355
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:12,881
So I say someone tweeted me and said not
to talk about duck dynasty and I know no

356
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:14,570
idea what they were talking about.

357
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,310
This is why I'll tell you why the,
the,

358
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:17,150
the,
um,

359
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,240
the thing I tweeted,
it's in the New Yorker and someone 

360
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,910
tweeted me or sent me the headline and I
looked at it and I was like,

361
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,940
what is this possible?
And then I realized it was the borrow 

362
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:30,940
it's report.
He's,

363
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,700
he's a comedian.
Oh,

364
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:36,701
okay.
Said Vincent Scalia Calls Duck Dynasty 

365
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:37,670
decision unconstitutional.
All I saw was the New Yorker Dot com,

366
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,940
you know,
so I thought it was some sort of a news 

367
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:42,940
story.
So I,

368
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,220
I posted it and so many people got 
angry.

369
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,760
There was so much anger he'll fucking 
supreme court to say with a lot of 

370
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,220
people who agree with and I was like,
Whoa,

371
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:53,510
Whoa,
whoa.

372
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:59,140
I got a lot of Jesus tweets,
a lot of people talking to me about sin 

373
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,720
and the sins of the flesh and Jesus says
that you,

374
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,170
there was a slew of them,
came my way,

375
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,130
and I was like,
wow.

376
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,410
And then so I had the tweet after that,
hey folks,

377
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:08,120
not familiar with the bar,
which report,

378
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:13,150
he's a comedy writer and when I post it 
was satire.

379
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,650
Everybody take it easy.
He was just being funny.

380
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,000
But why is everybody getting mad about 
the duck guy getting removed from tv for

381
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:25,001
saying that he doesn't understand 
someone choosing a man's anus over a 

382
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,550
woman's vagina?
You,

383
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,130
let's compare that to a lot of things 
that people are allowed to say and not 

384
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:33,890
get kicked off TV for.
Yeah,

385
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:34,820
right.
You know,

386
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,940
I mean,
is that really a big deal that he's 

387
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,461
saying that I don't understand why 
anybody would choose a man's anus over a

388
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,670
girl's vagina either?
I wouldn't.

389
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,230
Okay.
It doesn't mean that,

390
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:50,231
uh,
I don't believe that people should be 

391
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:51,500
allowed to do whatever they want.
It's just that it's not that way for me.

392
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,050
It's like I don't understand when people
go to the opera,

393
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,620
I know people love the opera,
but I've been to the opera and I don't 

394
00:16:59,620 --> 00:16:59,620
understand it.
And I'm like,

395
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,210
it doesn't work with me.
Just like men's boutiques don't work 

396
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:04,430
with me,
but they do work with some.

397
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,800
What'd you pick a man's anus over the 
opera.

398
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,650
That's the question.
It's a toss up because I could,

399
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:11,330
you know,
you fucking got correctly.

400
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:14,590
You're done in 10 minutes.
Operas take three hours,

401
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,780
hours.
They take hours in their fucking mental 

402
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,180
torture to me,
obviously not to you,

403
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,840
but you know,
that the duck dynasty where he fucked up

404
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,730
his,
he was a,

405
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,750
he wasn't just saying that he doesn't 
understand people making that choice.

406
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,550
He's also talking about sins,
you know,

407
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,170
and people start talking about people 
writing in hell for being gay.

408
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:39,530
And the network has to show a certain 
amount of,

409
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,870
uh,
I want to say,

410
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,830
I don't want to say guidance,
but they have to set a certain amount of

411
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:50,831
an example if they are the people that 
are ultimately responsible for putting 

412
00:17:50,831 --> 00:17:54,630
something on television and a guy says 
something that is kind of homophobic and

413
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,130
I mean,
not even kind of homophobic.

414
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,540
What was his actual,
uh,

415
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,940
the actual quote,
let's,

416
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,230
let's pull up the actual quote because 
uh,

417
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,130
it was,
um,

418
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,830
to me it's like,
you know,

419
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:11,790
you're talking to a guy who wrote a book
and his whole thing is about,

420
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,160
his shtick is about being controversial 
and you know,

421
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,210
being a wild man with this wacky beard 
and him and his sons and they all hold 

422
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,330
hands and pray at the end of every 
episode.

423
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,820
You know,
his fucking cock shore.

424
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,580
Yes.
Talking about the queers now,

425
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,560
it's not like the president said that 
it's not.

426
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,510
I mean,
what is the redneck on TV?

427
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,620
Do you know what he looks like?
I mean,

428
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,780
oh,
you really surprised.

429
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:38,781
I mean,
thinking about the shit that archie 

430
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:38,781
bunker said,
and it's classic television and people a

431
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:43,370
long for and cherish what is his exact 
quote so you could pull up his quote 

432
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,430
says,
think it's funny.

433
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,500
It seems like to me a vagina as a man 
would be more desirable than a man's 

434
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,260
anus.
That's just me.

435
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:55,540
He adds.
There's more there.

436
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,100
She's got more to offer.
I mean,

437
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,170
come on dudes,
but hey sin.

438
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,730
It's not logical,
my man.

439
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,050
Okay.
See that's not that bad to me.

440
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,100
He didn't guy that sounds like a guy 
who's trying to do some comedy and 

441
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,850
trying to be funny and he's not good at 
it,

442
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,210
you know,
he's trying to be interesting or what?

443
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:19,211
Then he can take his whole life.
He's grown up being a duck call 

444
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:20,810
manufacturer and then over the next,
you know,

445
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,350
x amount of years he becomes one of the 
most popular people on television and 

446
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:28,700
people think he's funny on top.
They love that.

447
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,280
He talks crazy shit.
So I think,

448
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,290
you know,
he gets into that sort of vibe.

449
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,330
Obviously that's who he is in the first 
place.

450
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:39,590
The guy's not going to invent this 
character at 65 years of age or whatever

451
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:41,630
the fuck he is.
He's not the owner of chick fil a.

452
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,740
He says he's.
He continues start with homosexuality 

453
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,801
behavior and just more foul from their 
beastiality sleeping around with this 

454
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:50,860
woman and that woman,
those men,

455
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,610
they won't inherit the Kingdom of God.
It's not right.

456
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,180
He's,
I mean,

457
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:57,610
I don't want to sell much because I,
you know,

458
00:19:57,611 --> 00:19:58,900
it's fake,
so I just,

459
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:03,901
I don't watch any of that crap,
but they show a lot of church scenes in 

460
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:03,901
it,
don't they?

461
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:06,970
Like I remember seeing at least one.
It's a very religious show.

462
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,620
You don't fuck with God's America.

463
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,460
He released a statement.
Listen to this.

464
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,340
He said,
I myself am a product of the sixties.

465
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:17,110
I centered my life around sex,
drugs,

466
00:20:17,111 --> 00:20:20,920
and rock and roll until I hit rock 
bottom and accepted Jesus as my savior.

467
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,280
My mission today is to go forth and tell
people about why I follow Christ and 

468
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,421
also what the Bible teaches as a part of
that teaching is that women and men are 

469
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:32,860
meant to be together.
However,

470
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:37,861
I would never treat anyone with 
disrespect just because they're are 

471
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:37,861
different from me.
We all,

472
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,000
we are all created by the Almighty and 
like him.

473
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:45,001
I love all of humanity.
We would all be better off if we love 

474
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:46,660
God and love each other.
That was his quote.

475
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,710
What Dick?

476
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,290
Well,
TMZ has a thing up right now.

477
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:58,291
It says Phil Robertson publicly bashed 
gaze for years and he knew all about it.

478
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,380
I love how they have and he knew all 
about it and caps.

479
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,150
Well,
you know what,

480
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:05,830
man,
there's a lot of those dudes out there.

481
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,810
There's a lot of those weird dudes that 
care if guys are gay and then they do it

482
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,260
because they think that Jesus doesn't 
like it and they get angry about it.

483
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,450
I don't think anyone's ever read the 
Bible.

484
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,380
A few people that read it doesn't 
matter.

485
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,450
I tried one time.
I sat in so many hotel rooms.

486
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:27,451
I'm like,
I'm so many people talk about this 

487
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:27,451
thing.
I'm reading this fucking thing.

488
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:29,890
Couldn't get through it.
Very boring so it doesn't hold up.

489
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,840
You think the alter states doesn't hold 
up.

490
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,570
The Bible really doesn't hold up.
Yeah,

491
00:21:33,571 --> 00:21:34,850
I mean there's no mention.

492
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,080
There is no mention of iphone comes.
There's a lot of people that fucking 

493
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,700
read it though and they'll quote it back
to you when it our in that scripture.

494
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:48,810
16 chapter four,
and they'll just start quoting it and 

495
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:48,810
you're like,
why?

496
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,150
Why does it?
Why is quoting some book all of a sudden

497
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:54,520
give like this?
Why does it have power?

498
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,300
Because it's the word of God.
I come,

499
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,930
I can understand it.
Yeah.

500
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,650
Why hasn't God talk like more clearly 
covet thy neighbor's wife?

501
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,760
What are you saying?
What he's saying?

502
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,810
I can't fuck her.
Is that what would you please tell me 

503
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:09,810
what the fuck covet means?
I don't know.

504
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:14,371
Dude.
This is long before the Dick Van Dyke 

505
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:14,371
show.
You were not allowed to use those words.

506
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:16,420
Covet thy neighbor's wife.
Why don't you go tee off?

507
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:17,630
God,
Wham,

508
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,620
wham.
But yeah,

509
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,120
those shows are like,
they might as well be silent movies,

510
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,690
you know?

511
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,860
Might as well be the first,
the first minute and a half with him 

512
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:31,860
just getting his golf bag together and 
shit.

513
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,340
You know what else minds will be silent 
movie.

514
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,830
Unfortunately men watching TV shows,
watching it on actual television with 

515
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:41,710
commercials might as well be silent 
movies.

516
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:47,070
Yeah.
And like it's gotten to the point where 

517
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,861
it's like,
why would you sit down and watch what 

518
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:49,861
someone else's programmed for you.
It's like,

519
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:54,181
you know what?
You want to watch what I'm trying to 

520
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:54,181
sitting down and watching it through 
commercials.

521
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:58,640
Yeah.
I'm saying like if you don't have a dvr 

522
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:58,690
or if like I tried to watch the walking 
dead the other day I tried to,

523
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:03,790
I taped it on the dvr but I also had 
like an itunes subscription for it so I 

524
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:08,260
could watch on ipad and I mostly watch 
it on Itunes,

525
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,050
on my tv,
but I decided to try to watch it live.

526
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,660
Like actually watch it with the 
commercials on because it was on phone.

527
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,120
Let's watch it now.
Oh my God,

528
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,720
this is like a 15 fucking minutes,
like six commercial breaks and they 

529
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:21,720
played the same commercials.
Do not only that,

530
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,830
there was one time where it was like he,
they showed like five minutes of the 

531
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:26,830
show and then it went to commercial.
It was crazy.

532
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,440
It was like,
this doesn't make any sense.

533
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,570
Like how the fuck can you.
You can't concentrate on the action.

534
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:34,360
You're not really into it.
You get lost in this,

535
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:39,470
this breakup by all this shit that you 
don't want to see and then you got to 

536
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,481
get sucked back into the action.
It takes a couple minutes and then next 

537
00:23:42,481 --> 00:23:42,481
thing that was another fucking 
commercial.

538
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,060
I forgot how unbelievably like 
disjointed.

539
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Watching a show is like that.
I trying to watch a show like that 

540
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,970
because I haven't done it so long,
but I did it the other night and it's 

541
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:54,970
fucking terrible.

542
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,610
Yeah.
I don't enjoy it at all.

543
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,620
I can't believe they do it that way.
That is the TA.

544
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,690
They're having commercials on in the 
middle of a show is the shittiest 

545
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,651
fucking way to break up a show.
Like it's one thing if you have like a 

546
00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:13,091
two hour show and you have an hour break
to pee in the middle or something like 

547
00:24:13,091 --> 00:24:14,780
that and everybody knows it.
You come back in,

548
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,100
look at the opera.
Yeah,

549
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,080
like a five minute commercial break that
everybody enjoys and that this and that,

550
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,240
and then it becomes a contest of who can
make the most creative commercials that 

551
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,390
make people actually want to stick 
around and watch them and then they have

552
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:27,980
this five,
seven,

553
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:30,590
whatever the fuck minutes of commercials
and then the next shell plays.

554
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,000
That's how they should do it.
Just mixed the products in the shows.

555
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,850
Yeah.
But then you can't trust the show.

556
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,830
You're like thinking,
well why is he have a coke there?

557
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:41,630
Because they paid them down there,
you know,

558
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,680
as the Zombie of a sprite.
They already do that.

559
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:45,230
If they already do that on television 
shows.

560
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:46,160
Yeah.
But if you go to my house,

561
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:48,020
you're going to see a coke,
you're going to see a sprite.

562
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:50,530
Why make it some fake one that's even 
throws you out of your,

563
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,180
you know,
the real wisdom to begin with.

564
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,280
You know like if you have like a pop 
soda,

565
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,740
you know,
no one has pop sodas.

566
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,750
Do you look at it and go,
oh this is fake because they don't pay 

567
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,420
you unless you prominently feature.
They don't pay you if you just use it.

568
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,630
Like they give you free shit to use.
Like when we were on news radio,

569
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:09,470
they had like fake coax.
They were like the had like a sticker.

570
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,560
They would put over a real coke but the 
logo was approved.

571
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,920
It was approved to use that.
If they want to pay you,

572
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:21,250
then you got to do a coke commercial.
You're going to have the coke right 

573
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:21,250
there.
It's like this.

574
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,480
They're just giving you coke.
But if they wanted to pay you,

575
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,500
you know,
then then things would get different 

576
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:28,500
than you would have to actually say,
you know what,

577
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,990
why don't you just have a coke and a 
smile and shut your pie hole.

578
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,950
And then it would be like written into 
it that you have to say coke every day.

579
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:39,100
I think there's a big difference between
like product placement and then like a 

580
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,071
real commercial,
like the kind of monies that you get 

581
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:44,591
when you're doing a commercial.
They get a lot of money when they're 

582
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:46,370
doing like think about like how many 
people were watching walking dead,

583
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,400
what is it,
like $16 million a show or something 

584
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,400
crazy like that.

585
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Who knows what the number is?
Something huge,

586
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,070
something huge,
right?

587
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,370
So just thinking about how many fucking 
people are watching those commercials 

588
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:57,470
and how much those commercials are worth
to the network.

589
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,670
Big money sign,
big money because if you're getting past

590
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:03,500
a million views,
2 million,

591
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:06,080
then you become a phenomenon like the 
walking dead.

592
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,270
They're going to get some cash for those
ads,

593
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,900
those ads,
they're worth something and then those 

594
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,520
ads are fucking up the whole show.
They got to figure out how to bumper it,

595
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,690
put them in the beginning,
put them on the end,

596
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,390
let the whole thing play out so you can 
get drawn into it.

597
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:25,770
Just need.
Just wait for the season to be over 

598
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:25,770
with.
Downloaded it all.

599
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:25,770
Well you don't have to wait.
You can download it as it's,

600
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,680
as it's airing.
Yeah.

601
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,970
That's where we get it from itunes.
But uh,

602
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:30,920
it doesn't,
I don't think it comes out the day of,

603
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,320
I think the day after or something along
those lines.

604
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,840
I might be wrong about that,
but I think I looked for at once when it

605
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:40,841
was only on the Dvr,
which is why I had to go with that 

606
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:42,410
terrible.
Another thing that happened,

607
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:47,411
which isn't half as bad but still 
annoying as shit is the whole fucking 

608
00:26:47,411 --> 00:26:49,820
advertisement right on the show.
Oh,

609
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,100
oh,
I'll take you out of it about sports.

610
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:58,101
Do that all the time.
You're watching one thing and at the 

611
00:26:58,101 --> 00:26:58,101
bottom is all this other shit about,
you know,

612
00:26:58,101 --> 00:27:00,420
the guy pops up and he's like,
yeah,

613
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:05,421
those little floaty little ghost in the 
corner that tell you about an upcoming 

614
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:07,900
show coming up next on CBS.

615
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,070
Yeah,
no shit.

616
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:11,970
It's with,
they're,

617
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:16,971
they're dinosaurs.
Those things are all these like old 

618
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:19,821
ways.
When that was the only way to get the 

619
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:19,821
word out.
Just go tweeted NBC.

620
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:19,900
Okay.
Tweet it.

621
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,970
Yeah.
Don't don't run a big little fucking 

622
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,440
little Munchkin in the corner that's 
dancing around telling you to tune into 

623
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,600
the next show while the show was on 
right now,

624
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,970
hugging Munchkin.
Confusing the fuck out of me,

625
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:34,971
man.
The scroll is definitely the worst 

626
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:34,971
though,
right?

627
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:35,160
Yeah.
Scroll that you can't stop reading.

628
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,470
Yeah,
you can't pay attention to this girl and

629
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,530
shit.
Watching,

630
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,030
watching a scroll.
Fox Sports,

631
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,760
lots of sports places.
They love that shit.

632
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:47,490
They love just giving you like if you're
watching a sports show,

633
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,050
they're not just going to give you the 
sports.

634
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:52,350
They're going to give you fucking stats 
and info at the bottom of football.

635
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:53,550
People love that Shit,
man.

636
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,260
Stock Market.
People love that shit.

637
00:27:55,261 --> 00:28:00,261
If you watch a financial show,
they run the fucking market up five 

638
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:00,261
points.
I'll get that fucking numbers.

639
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,420
How exciting.
Lot of new shows like Fox News does that

640
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:03,960
too,
don't they?

641
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,550
They'll show you the news and they'll 
scroll.

642
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,580
Some Taliban commander killed.
16 dead drone strikes,

643
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,680
have all that shit on the bottom while 
it's going on.

644
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,660
California man kills Jesus Christ.
Again.

645
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,780
He was only a tuna sandwich,
says the homeless men.

646
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,540
Yeah.
This,

647
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,320
this,
that inundation with shit,

648
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,420
which is constantly coming at you.
It almost makes the Internet less 

649
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,040
complicated in a way.
It's an actual television aided.

650
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,280
Well,
the beautiful thing about the Internet 

651
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,661
is there's a few live things,
but most of this stuff is just there to 

652
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:35,661
download.
Yeah.

653
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:37,920
You can just stream it and get it when 
you want it.

654
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:38,880
It's just there.
I mean,

655
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:43,881
there's a few live like honey honey did 
a live music show from God,

656
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,920
I want to say England.
They in England,

657
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,580
I want to say they were in England.
I might be wrong,

658
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,760
but it was a,
they had it streamed through some 

659
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,220
website and it was pay what you think 
it's worth.

660
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,230
Yeah.
Cool.

661
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:57,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

662
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,780
That's great.
So you can put a dollar in or nothing or

663
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:05,781
50 bucks or whatever and uh,
they would show you a live stream of 

664
00:29:05,781 --> 00:29:06,990
their concert,
which I thought was pretty dope.

665
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:12,050
Nice.
But other than that kind of stuff or 

666
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,810
this kind of stuff like it ustream or 
something along those lines,

667
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,550
it's just,
you're just downloading things.

668
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:17,280
It's just most of the time it's just,
it's already out there.

669
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,660
Yeah.
TV shows,

670
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,470
man.
The idea,

671
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:21,810
you have to wait and it's Saturday 
night.

672
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:24,110
Is it seven yet?
Thirty?

673
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,100
It's ridiculous.
Thirty more minutes.

674
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,620
Yeah.
And then you sit there and then you have

675
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:30,510
to sit through the commercials and all 
that.

676
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,890
That's a Goddamn silent movie.
Yeah.

677
00:29:33,891 --> 00:29:35,070
No,
that's what happens to me.

678
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:40,071
You know,
and I'm on the road or I'm in a hotel 

679
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:41,751
room.
That's the only time I watch TV as TV 

680
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:41,751
and I'm like,
I can't find anything I want watch.

681
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:44,260
You never don't change the channels.
You just get the shit.

682
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,670
Yeah.
When you're in a TV,

683
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:49,030
especially if you're in a hotel and the 
they give you like a guide,

684
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,110
like you have like right next to the 
right,

685
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,540
right next to your bed.

686
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,540
They'll give you like a big piece of 
paper that has like Hbo Channel Ten 

687
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:57,970
showtime shelter or whatever the fuck it
is.

688
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,430
But other than that you don't know 
what's on.

689
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,290
You have no idea.
You have no idea.

690
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:04,900
Just changing channels.
So he constantly changing channels,

691
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,900
watching some stupid piece of shit 
changed,

692
00:30:06,901 --> 00:30:09,070
handle watching that stupid piece of 
shit changed.

693
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:14,310
Very unsatisfying experience.
Almost every single thing you get stuck 

694
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,641
on his hbo and Public Access.
Local public access or if I like a 

695
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:19,840
really good show comes on that you 
didn't expect or really good movie,

696
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,390
that's a nice thing because it's a one 
out of 10.

697
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,720
Then it's like hunting and you get that 
satisfaction of winning the lottery.

698
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,370
But it's rare.
You know,

699
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:30,040
gambling is a tough game.
It usually leaves you unsatisfied.

700
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,170
Yeah.
The,

701
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:37,171
the.
And then if you want to get movies from 

702
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:39,571
movie,
like those movie things where you press 

703
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,590
menu and oh yeah,
he pays $17.

704
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,880
Ninety nine to watch some terrible 
fucking moving.

705
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,620
You know what's really funny is when you
self,

706
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,770
when you,
when you go to the movies now and you 

707
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:49,770
see something really funny,
you're like,

708
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,340
you're reaching for the remote control.
Like I want to see that again.

709
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,290
Oh I can't.
That's funny.

710
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:59,010
Yeah.
I think that when you're a you have 

711
00:30:59,010 --> 00:30:59,010
access to shit like we have on the 
Internet,

712
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,060
we're getting super spoiled to the idea 
of immediacy,

713
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:06,330
just being able to get things whenever 
you want it and being able to like if 

714
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:06,330
you want to watch an ad,
you watch an ad.

715
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,340
You know what I like.
I like when I go to a youtube page and 

716
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:11,340
it starts playing an ad and then it 
says,

717
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,070
skip this ad.
I go,

718
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:15,760
yes,
unless it's something I'm interested in,

719
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:21,260
I'll watch a little bit if it's 
something that I'm interested in but I 

720
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,260
don't want to have to.

721
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,110
It's awesome that they know that they 
can't get away with showing them a 

722
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,300
minute add.
Well sometimes they're really long.

723
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,580
Sometimes like four or five minutes.
You can skip them though,

724
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:27,990
right?
Yeah.

725
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,540
They sometimes they're like little shows
like you're,

726
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:32,770
you're forced to watch it,
but I've seen some interesting ones.

727
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:38,130
I've seen some cool ones,
some luxury extended trailers and some 

728
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:38,130
interesting ones.
They've really upped their game.

729
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,620
When you consider like in the eighties,
it was like folgers coffee.

730
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,490
I really enjoy this drink,
which you rarely see though if you watch

731
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:50,491
a youtube video is you rarely see 
commercials in the beginning and then 

732
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,851
they pause in the middle and then have 
more commercials and then they pause 

733
00:31:53,851 --> 00:31:53,851
again and again.
You don't see that.

734
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,840
You get to see the whole thing.
I don't know.

735
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,230
Probably the vast majority of what 
you're downloading from youtube,

736
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:01,060
it's probably short clips for most 
people,

737
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,980
but there's some pretty long shit on 
there too.

738
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,180
Yeah,
you can watch TV on.

739
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,360
Watch our podcasts on there.
All three hours of them.

740
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,100
Yeah.
So there's some,

741
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,040
there's some long shit that's on there 
as well,

742
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,330
so I don't buy the idea that like it has
to be done that way,

743
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,360
that it has to be every 15 minutes.
I think that's one of the things that's 

744
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:18,360
going to kill them.
Yeah,

745
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,960
it's gonna.
It's gonna cripple the business that 

746
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,420
people are going to get annoyed by the 
fact that this is what the experience is

747
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:24,700
limited to.
And then once people start putting money

748
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:29,701
into like,
like Hulu plus doing original 

749
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:29,701
programming,
original programming,

750
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:30,400
Netflix,
Netflix,

751
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:31,850
doing house of cards.
And uh,

752
00:32:31,851 --> 00:32:36,851
what was the other show they were doing?
A black is the orange is the new black 

753
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:40,460
is a good one and that is the prison 
prison prison show.

754
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:46,070
So when guys like that,
when they started doing new shows and 

755
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:50,201
creating their own content and putting 
it online and making it available 

756
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:50,201
through devices,
like,

757
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,980
you know,
I get my netflix through my DVD player,

758
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:56,981
you know,
you can get your netflix through 

759
00:32:56,981 --> 00:32:56,981
appletv,
you can lose a lot of different ways.

760
00:32:56,981 --> 00:32:57,860
You get it and you get it instantly.
Yeah.

761
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:03,040
You know.
And it's going to be real hard to 

762
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,040
compete with that.
If you make me watch commercials,

763
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,000
you know,
it seems like I would rather pay seven 

764
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,000
bucks a month and not watch commercials.
It's seven bucks.

765
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,250
That's not that much,
you know what I mean?

766
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,730
How much is apple TV?
Every time you download the show is $600

767
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,610
for the whole season,
you know,

768
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,730
hours and hours and hours and hours of 
entertainment and you don't watch a 

769
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,270
single commercial.
I'll fucking take totally worth it.

770
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,720
It's worth more than that probably.
If you really stopped and thought about 

771
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,111
it,
like it's probably worth like 100 bucks 

772
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:32,210
to watch a full season of a really good 
show.

773
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,710
You take a decent amount,
you pay hundreds for like 20 years ago.

774
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:41,890
Yeah.
To have that kind of access to a TV 

775
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,901
show.
You think they're going to do that with 

776
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:43,901
movies ever will.

777
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:47,050
They're going to have the option where 
you could download it to your home and 

778
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:47,050
you're like,
you have to pay 50 bucks.

779
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,920
Like you can't.
If you go to the movies and you're going

780
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:49,790
into a,
you know,

781
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,180
like an Imax and you're gonna see some 
fucking new,

782
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:58,580
you know,
Saifai thriller or some new fill in the 

783
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,831
blank.
Whatever it is you're going to probably 

784
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:03,170
spend.
How much is it?

785
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,390
How much does the ticket these days 
nowadays?

786
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:05,840
It's like,
oh,

787
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:07,220
at least avatar.
Liquid.

788
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,560
The 10 bucks,
15 bucks.

789
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:11,760
Let's go to the high.
Let's go to the 20 [inaudible].

790
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,790
Let's pretend we're in New York,
right?

791
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,500
You to see Avatar and you got to pay 20 
bucks a ticket.

792
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,180
Would you pay 50 to watch it at home?
You probably want some people.

793
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,080
Definitely was somebody who is already 
doing that,

794
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:26,081
so maybe he's already doing that now at 
theater movies on itunes or movies that 

795
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:30,101
actually came out in theaters in.
They're giving you the option to watch 

796
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:30,320
it at home.
Really know these movies good.

797
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:33,580
Or they usually independent movies 
usually like the independent or smaller,

798
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,750
smaller budget ones,
but there's been a few,

799
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:40,770
you know,
that actually I've been pretty big size 

800
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,960
but then then again there's something 
really cool about going to the movie.

801
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,170
I really like going to the movies 
lately.

802
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:47,470
I find that's one of the only things 
that can get me out of my head lately.

803
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,720
Liquor don't work.
No more pot.

804
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:50,980
Kind of.
Does that occur?

805
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:52,210
Don't work on the full job?
No,

806
00:34:52,211 --> 00:34:52,690
no,
no.

807
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:54,490
I'm immune to it now.
What's going on?

808
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:59,550
I don't know.
I haven't been to a movie in over a 

809
00:34:59,550 --> 00:34:59,550
year.
You build up a tolerance.

810
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,140
Movies are great because you're not,
you're not allowed to check your phone.

811
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,910
Well,
I mean people still do it.

812
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:06,390
I don't.
I follow the rules and I'm in there.

813
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,570
I'm in the movie.
Um,

814
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,660
I can,
I can get out of my head and it's all 

815
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:12,660
full up here.
I like the movies.

816
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,150
The ladies behind us.
We went to see the desolation of smog.

817
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,460
Wouldn't stop talking to each other 
about the movie

818
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,010
in the movie.
Yes.

819
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,480
And it wasn't loud enough where you can 
really say anything.

820
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,400
Yeah,
it kills you.

821
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,100
It kills you because you're like,
should I say something?

822
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,080
And then if you say something you feel 
bad.

823
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:32,880
It

824
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,880
wasn't loud enough.
But the reality is it shouldn't be God 

825
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,250
damn talking to the entire.
Like they kept it throughout

826
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,960
the movie,
but you'd be an asset.

827
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:42,270
It was like at the level where you'd be 
an asshole if you brought it up.

828
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,290
It's,
it's,

829
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,280
it's awful because the movie's so loud.
Like how can you even hear?

830
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,240
But you can.
You fucking can.

831
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:53,241
You know it's there and it's,
it takes away from the experience a 

832
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:53,241
little bit.
You're not.

833
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:57,441
It's wrapped up in it.
It's a level of purgatory that's worse 

834
00:35:57,441 --> 00:35:58,350
than hell.
Smog is good though,

835
00:35:58,351 --> 00:35:59,170
man.
Let me see.

836
00:35:59,171 --> 00:36:02,490
Anchorman that looks good to anchorman.
Looks hilarious.

837
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,830
You can't go wrong with a will.
Ferrell movie,

838
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,990
did you hear who's a in it?
All told.

839
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,080
Oh,
come on.

840
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,730
Kanye has a cameo.
Oh,

841
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:12,540
that's hilarious.
Yeah.

842
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,930
Harrison Ford.
Harrison Ford has cameo.

843
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,080
Yeah.
If you remember the first one,

844
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:18,240
there's a good fight scene.
Yeah.

845
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:22,590
Connie and Harrison Ford fight.
I think Louie Anderson's there.

846
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,200
How do you know this?
Somebody told me that they were.

847
00:36:25,201 --> 00:36:26,610
They got the seed.
A premier.

848
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,310
Brian's.
Yeah.

849
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,060
Anchorman looks good.
You know,

850
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:36,060
it looks good to Godzilla.
Wolf of Wall Street was my idea.

851
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:39,870
Oh,
how is he going to hear it?

852
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,890
I saw cheech.
Marin,

853
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,760
no doubt you did at union station 
downtown.

854
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,480
Let's hear it.

855
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,130
Okay.

856
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,460
Tommy Chong,
the wolf of Wall Street.

857
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,600
My idea.

858
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,470
So I heard that you shared a cell with 
Jordan Belfort.

859
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,380
Yeah.
A cubicle or cubicle.

860
00:37:00,381 --> 00:37:02,390
Yeah.
And we don't sell it and call each other

861
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:07,391
cellmates we call ourselves sellies.
You also mentioned it was very similar 

862
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:09,480
to goodfellas.
That was nice.

863
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,870
You mentioned it was very similar to 
goodfellows.

864
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,610
Well yeah.
Well that was my favorite part.

865
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:15,640
So please like,
did you guys have to have someone like a

866
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,690
wife smuggling bread or like what 
happened?

867
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:17,930
Yeah,

868
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,940
we actually,
we had people smuggled Turkey and course

869
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,460
for uh,
for Thanksgiving.

870
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,840
Oh my God,
that is awesome.

871
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,080
Yeah.
We show one of the wives,

872
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,270
put her dinner boots are big boots.

873
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,370
I heard he also urged him to write it 
down.

874
00:37:32,371 --> 00:37:35,160
Do you think you deserve any of the 
royalties from that movie being made?

875
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:36,000
Coming up for Jordan?

876
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,700
I get inspired.
I wrote my book called a meditation from

877
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:45,660
the Jordan and Jordan asked me,
you know,

878
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,410
I'd write everyday and what are you 
doing?

879
00:37:47,411 --> 00:37:50,080
I told him so he said,
did he,

880
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:55,090
he's so used to reading his book and 
they wrote a few pages and he showed me 

881
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:59,750
and then I kind of insulted him because 
I told him you haven't written anything 

882
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,750
and he got really mad because he's a 
genius.

883
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:07,250
So he ended up rewriting.
I told them how to do it right from the 

884
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,730
heart rate of but what you know.
And uh,

885
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,220
next thing you know,
he's got a best seller movie.

886
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,900
That's ridiculous.
You should get a crazy.

887
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,550
I just seeing him do good.
Actually,

888
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:22,300
my biggest thrill is watching him make 
money,

889
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:24,700
honestly,
because he was such a genius,

890
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:26,190
but he was,
you know,

891
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,970
he was like all thieves,
you know,

892
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,080
they had twisted.

893
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Wow,
that's much different than the headline 

894
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,770
is different.
I was just going to say that that's 

895
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:37,660
really irresponsible headline,
but that's what got us to listen.

896
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,930
If it was like Tommy Chong salutes a so 
and so for the success.

897
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,730
I mean,
all he said is that he helped the guy.

898
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:47,060
Right.
You know,

899
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:52,140
now I didn't know that the guy who wrote
that was a guy who was selling to Tommy 

900
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,490
Chong.
I didn't know he was in jail.

901
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,500
That's interesting.
Wild.

902
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,170
Yeah.
I don't know.

903
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:57,700
Is that supposed to be good wolf of Wall
Street?

904
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:02,870
It looks great.
Looks Pretty dynamic that Leonardo 

905
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,030
Dicaprio flies under the radar with a 
lot of people,

906
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:05,830
but he might be the baddest mother 
fucker of them all.

907
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,860
I think he's fantastic and he,
Miss Garcia Square says he put us 

908
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:10,860
something every Christmas.
This is great dude.

909
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,890
That quintin Tarantino movie,
the Django moving when he makes the turn

910
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:18,130
from being a good guy to bad guy.
He's a bad motherfucker.

911
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,940
I think he's great.
He's he.

912
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,550
He's too cute.
That's the problem.

913
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:26,700
Got To fucking handsome.
And Duck Dynasty said he's the only 

914
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,680
asshole that's better than a vagina.
Did he really say that?

915
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:33,170
I'm sure it sounds like something they 
would say they suspended.

916
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:38,911
The dude pulled them off and for that I 
feel like the headlines are way worse 

917
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:40,990
than the quotes on these things.

918
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,300
Yeah,
I agree.

919
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,330
I just had an issue with this microphone
here.

920
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:53,190
We'll be right back folks.
This would actually be a good place for 

921
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,140
commercial commercial.
Turn off a broken thing.

922
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,570
Fix that shit.
Do.

923
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,670
Hm.

924
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:07,180
This is just a shitty microphone arm.
I was going to switch this to those 

925
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,030
anyway because it's actually a bad 
commercial for these mics.

926
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:16,360
Brian stole a Friday.
Joe Rogan and jody said ideas are going 

927
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,320
to be a house with a few other comments 
this Friday,

928
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:26,410
this Friday.
ICEHOUSE chronicles and tomorrow's show 

929
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:26,410
tomorrow.
Uh,

930
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,640
we got a bunch of good people on that.
And Joe Rogan's going to be at the 

931
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,740
Hollywood improv.
Uh,

932
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:34,880
it,
uh,

933
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,160
forget New Year's Eve.
Beautiful.

934
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,940
I got a commercial for Ya.
Nice new CD.

935
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,280
This is the part of the job I hate now 
on Itunes,

936
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,180
a job I hate.
It's now an itunes.

937
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,730
Now when I tune it's available to the 
public,

938
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:55,050
just get another one.
We're going to have to switch out 

939
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:55,050
microphones here.
Ladies and gentlemen,

940
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:55,580
we had an issue.
This is what happens.

941
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,850
Shitty Chinese made Mike.
Um,

942
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,740
we just went to America.
Detroit makes a fine.

943
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:01,240
Mike,
um,

944
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,250
is actually ones that Fitzsimmons has on
his,

945
00:41:04,251 --> 00:41:05,600
uh,
his,

946
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:10,601
uh,
serious show that are pretty dope and 

947
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:10,601
I'm trying to find.
Couldn't find them.

948
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,780
Don't mix.
The mikes are great.

949
00:41:11,781 --> 00:41:14,960
The Mike Arms Soco fat one,
the ones that,

950
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,980
um,
that um,

951
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,570
Craig Simmons has on his serious show.
These really thick,

952
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:23,480
like tubular aluminum looking ones.
They don't like the,

953
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,460
the wire goes through the center of 
them.

954
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,980
Yeah.
It doesn't have all this a velcro.

955
00:41:27,981 --> 00:41:28,880
Bullshit.
Need.

956
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,500
Get this.
Why don't you guys talk yourselves.

957
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,010
Okay.

958
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,760
To Texas tour,
uh,

959
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,430
me and Tony Hinchcliffe are coming to 
Houston,

960
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,470
Austin and Dallas,
one January,

961
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:43,700
ninth,
10th and 11th.

962
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,510
And we're also bringing a surprise 
guests that are about to announce.

963
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,620
Tell us,
tell us the tickets are on sale now.

964
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:54,410
You can just go to [inaudible] dot TV or
will you.

965
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,090
Will you bring me back some ribs,
Brian?

966
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,400
I was thinking about some Texas ribs 
today.

967
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,070
Have a mouth water and can't wait to go 
back to Texas.

968
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,920
I can't wait.
I hope to run into Aubrey on.

969
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,900
It's there.
I want to hang out with Alex Jones.

970
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,900
I might spend an extra day in Austin 
maybe.

971
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,280
Have you ever spoken to Alex Jones 
outside of the time she'd been the show?

972
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,210
Yeah,
he is my.

973
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,310
He once in a while,
text me back in the day.

974
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:18,410
He would text me back and forth and 
Alex,

975
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,210
but then I would text him and somebody 
else would have his phone number.

976
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,710
Barbecue is.
I know the best.

977
00:42:22,711 --> 00:42:25,380
Barbecue is where the CIA is.
Not watching you every five seconds.

978
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,080
Wait,
try.

979
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:30,630
Enjoy a fucking brisket.
I love Alex Jones.

980
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,230
No,
he's great.

981
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,060
I can't wait to get back to Austin to 
see that.

982
00:42:33,061 --> 00:42:33,240
Dude.

983
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,930
I can't wait to have him on the show 
sometime.

984
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:36,820
I'm surprised that we've never had him 
on the podcast.

985
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,530
We'll

986
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,900
eventually.
He's just never in La and he,

987
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:42,210
when he has,
he's busy dodge and chem trails,

988
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:47,290
so a lot of busy work will have many 
people get a chance to see a different 

989
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:47,910
side of them.
We do,

990
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:53,460
you know,
I'm sure he'll go crazy and yell and 

991
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:53,460
scream,
but you'll get to see a side of him.

992
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:53,460
Well,
you'll get it.

993
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:53,910
You'll go,
oh,

994
00:42:53,911 --> 00:42:58,911
that's why they hang out.
Like he's a fun dude and people always 

995
00:42:58,911 --> 00:42:58,911
ask me,
wait a minute,

996
00:42:58,911 --> 00:42:59,910
is he for real?
Yes,

997
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:00,930
he is.
Yes,

998
00:43:00,931 --> 00:43:02,730
he is for real,
for the most part.

999
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,040
And uh,
he's fun to hang out with man.

1000
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,240
Uh,
but we are having Roseanne Barr on.

1001
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:14,241
She's going to be on here.
Thirtieth next week is going to be 

1002
00:43:15,151 --> 00:43:17,700
Monday.
Joey Diaz and Tuesday Duncan trussell.

1003
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:22,730
Nice.
So we've got a lot of shit going on and 

1004
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,251
there was a gentleman and a lot of 
things happened with Alex Jones back 

1005
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:28,581
when the old car Cap City Comedy Club in
Austin,

1006
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:29,310
Texas.

1007
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,580
When they,
uh,

1008
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,500
showed you camp trails.
That was the old.

1009
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,400
The old.
The old back room.

1010
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,820
Yeah.
It's so stupid that they got rid of it.

1011
00:43:38,821 --> 00:43:40,670
There was so much history on that.
Yeah,

1012
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,060
they fucked up.
That was a dumb move.

1013
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,300
That room was awesome.
That room was just filled with people 

1014
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,190
signatures for decades and decades of 
comedy and they decided to paint over it

1015
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:54,680
for some strange reason for no reason.
Right.

1016
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,750
Whose idea was a cap city?
How dare you.

1017
00:43:58,410 --> 00:43:59,910
Meanwhile,
I was one of the greatest clubs over.

1018
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,710
Yeah,
it's a must stop.

1019
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:07,220
Like if you're a comic and you're doing 
like a national tour and you know you 

1020
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,520
have like 12 spots we're going to hit.
You're going to.

1021
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:09,660
Austin.
Got To go there.

1022
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,240
You get booked at cap city.
You'd be retarded not to go.

1023
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,390
You gotta go silly bitch.
Start the wall all over again.

1024
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,730
They're good.
They're smart.

1025
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:18,870
They're cooled.
They're.

1026
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,820
They don't give a fuck.
They're from Texas.

1027
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:23,070
Not Show biz obsessed.
No.

1028
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:28,430
It's a totally different vibe and they 
liked to party and drink some beers.

1029
00:44:28,951 --> 00:44:30,790
People locked you part and

1030
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,880
that sounds like matthew mcconaughey 
forecasts everybody's to be there,

1031
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,840
Yada.
Come.

1032
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,720
Texas is a fun place to stop.
I'm not sure.

1033
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,180
I'd want to live there,
but it's a fun place to stop.

1034
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,090
Really.
Not,

1035
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,760
not like an Austin.
Um,

1036
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:52,761
I think maybe outside of Austin I'd like
to have a ranch where have a trusted 

1037
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:58,161
assistant guards the perimeter,
perhaps a wolf dog by my side.

1038
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,590
You got to get guns and you got to get 
dogs.

1039
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,020
Have you seen this?
A thing that they discovered in Bolivia.

1040
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:04,920
Brion.
Pull this up.

1041
00:45:04,921 --> 00:45:09,921
It's on my twitter.
Three hundred foot wall in Bolivia has 

1042
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:09,921
over 5,000
dinosaur footprints.

1043
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:11,010
Whoa.
That's crazy.

1044
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:13,880
The earth has moved so much since then 
that this is like,

1045
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:17,280
it's now like a straight wall,
like a flat cliff.

1046
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,020
It's really crazy to look at,
um,

1047
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,160
because you know,
the earth's topography changes and this 

1048
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:30,290
where these things are walking at one 
point in time it was probably like a 

1049
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:30,290
creek bed or something like that.

1050
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:33,440
But now now it's vertical.
Yeah.

1051
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,870
That muddy water or that muddy ground 
that they were walking on,

1052
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,900
there's a bunch of them.
They found a shit of a shitload of them,

1053
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,610
but it says the title of the,
um,

1054
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:48,030
feed is a twisted sifter,
twisted sifter.

1055
00:45:48,031 --> 00:45:50,640
I guess it's an archeologist website or 
something.

1056
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:55,750
What do you want to do with your life?
I want to look for this 300 foot wall in

1057
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:03,330
Bolivia has over 5,000
dinosaur footprints.

1058
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,500
It's crazy that it's a wall now,
so at one point in time they were 

1059
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,780
walking on it and then the earth fucking
radically shifted.

1060
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:14,781
So much so that it's like a wall and 
these muddy footprints are up the side 

1061
00:46:14,781 --> 00:46:16,470
of the wall.
It's crazy.

1062
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,810
So I wish someone was here that knew 
what the fuck was going on.

1063
00:46:18,811 --> 00:46:20,910
So they explained this to us.
Yeah,

1064
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,550
because I'm just assuming it tends to 
happen.

1065
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:29,450
Hey,
what do you guys know a lot about 

1066
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:29,450
dinosaurs?
Are they really those bright colors?

1067
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:29,450
No,
but as much as anybody.

1068
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,140
No Bro.
No.

1069
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:33,360
It's awesome.
Dinosaur Gel speculative.

1070
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,600
In fact,
there was some recent speculation that 

1071
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,931
because of the way t rex was built that 
he might not have been a Predator at 

1072
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:45,651
all,
that he might've been a scavenger and 

1073
00:46:45,651 --> 00:46:45,651
that he might've been very vulture like 
that.

1074
00:46:45,651 --> 00:46:49,731
Instead of looking at this green 
murderer that we see in Jurassic Park 

1075
00:46:49,731 --> 00:46:50,670
that he would have like these really 
bright red skin.

1076
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,380
I called out to see if you could find 
those images brion,

1077
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:57,570
pull up a t rex,
vulture scavenger,

1078
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,600
t rex.
But if it's interesting because you 

1079
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:02,600
realize when you see something like 
that,

1080
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,980
oh,
they're just guessing type in bad rap to

1081
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:10,020
Brian just understood dinosaur Tbx,
vulture x's.

1082
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,360
Oh,
um,

1083
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:16,630
it,
yeah.

1084
00:47:16,631 --> 00:47:19,630
You can find there's some right here.
No,

1085
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:20,890
that's not it.
If you go down to other,

1086
00:47:20,891 --> 00:47:22,270
this one,
this one here,

1087
00:47:22,271 --> 00:47:25,390
they uh,
they,

1088
00:47:25,391 --> 00:47:30,391
they drew him with a very bright red 
face and a black skin behind it,

1089
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:33,580
much like our door.
And that was,

1090
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:34,450
uh,
one of the,

1091
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:39,451
one of the speculations was that he 
wasn't able to run fast enough because 

1092
00:47:39,451 --> 00:47:43,331
of the way he's built that it really 
just wood lumber onto dead things and 

1093
00:47:43,331 --> 00:47:46,381
fuck them up.
And there's also some evidence that 

1094
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:48,391
something's got away from him,
which is pretty interesting when you 

1095
00:47:48,391 --> 00:47:50,410
consider how fucking big they are.
How did anything ever get away from that

1096
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:55,730
with that mouth?
But there was bite marks on things that 

1097
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,381
actually had had survived for x amount 
of years or x amount of months or 

1098
00:47:58,381 --> 00:48:00,340
whatever after been attacked by one of 
these fucking things.

1099
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,300
You think we got a lot of big animals 
still that aren't that fast.

1100
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:05,860
And I'm like,
this motherfucker,

1101
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,040
you know,
the thing about the time of the 

1102
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,711
dinosaurs is also that the whole 
atmosphere was different than the 

1103
00:48:13,711 --> 00:48:14,590
atmospheric pressure was different.
The amount of oxygen,

1104
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,330
the air was different,
the temperature was different,

1105
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:21,840
and if it was a really super oxygen rich
gaseous environment like I think has 

1106
00:48:22,141 --> 00:48:27,141
been speculated,
it might've been easier for a big thing 

1107
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:29,011
like that to move.
And that might've made sense why there 

1108
00:48:29,011 --> 00:48:32,321
are so many big dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs were fucking dwarfing 

1109
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:34,330
elephants.
They were huge.

1110
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:35,260
Really?
Yeah.

1111
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:37,750
If you look at like Brontosaurus,
you know,

1112
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,720
look at all those really giant plant 
eating dinosaurs.

1113
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:45,550
They were fucking enormous.
We went to the Natural Museum of history

1114
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:50,610
in New York.
They have all those bones of the 

1115
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:53,050
dinosaurs.
When you stand next to one of those 

1116
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:53,050
things,
you just go,

1117
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:53,050
oh my God,
like you,

1118
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,380
you really get it in your head like 
Jesus Christ.

1119
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,810
Why did it,
why is it that big?

1120
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,640
Why did it grow?
That was everything.

1121
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Right?
And now you look around and everything's

1122
00:49:03,001 --> 00:49:04,680
small horses.
Not that vague,

1123
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,480
you know?
Right.

1124
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:07,890
And that's little ass dudes are running 
this shit.

1125
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:10,570
Giraffe is like a baby compared to a 
dinosaur.

1126
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,820
Like that's the biggest shit.
We got crazy long neck asked a

1127
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:20,270
you're received.
But if a t rex it looked like if it was 

1128
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:20,270
furry because I always thought what if 
they had for.

1129
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,630
They look kind of like crows,
like look at this.

1130
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,880
Wow.
So they don't even know if they were 

1131
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:27,880
offering.
I don't know.

1132
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:27,880
But you know,
it's crazy.

1133
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,520
They know that a lot of dinosaurs did 
have feathers.

1134
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,130
Yeah,
there's the direct descendants.

1135
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:36,180
What if a t rex to us it looks scary 
because it'd be like taking a bird and 

1136
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:36,640
taking all its feathers off and then 
yeah,

1137
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,620
it looks scary.
It looks creepy as fuck.

1138
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,170
No,
they look scary,

1139
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:46,890
but it was cute.
If you have a bird that has a head that 

1140
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,060
big,
it's probably even scarier.

1141
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,690
A bird with teeth like that and a head 
is big as a t rex,

1142
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,520
be fucking terrible.
Evil.

1143
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,800
Just an eagle can fuck you up.
Right?

1144
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,160
I'll look at that shit.
You know,

1145
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:59,960
you should google maps,
Google terror birds t e R,

1146
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:04,961
r o r birds.
These were these gigantic six foot tall 

1147
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:07,130
birds that they might've been even 
bigger.

1148
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,640
They um,
they didn't fly.

1149
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:14,360
They just fuck people up.
They just fucked things up.

1150
00:50:14,361 --> 00:50:16,490
Dude.
Two point five meters.

1151
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:21,520
So yeah,
they were a six and a half feet tall or 

1152
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:21,520
six.
How tall?

1153
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,350
Two and one and a half is a meter,
right?

1154
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,340
Three meters.
Three telling me an American.

1155
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,040
So they were a seven.
A half feet tall.

1156
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,830
Seven and a half feet tall.
It says eight foot.

1157
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:31,580
Two inches.

1158
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,350
Okay.
Why didn't you just say that?

1159
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:37,550
Why you making me do math meters?
Three is a meter.

1160
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:39,020
Three feet or the yard?
Three feet.

1161
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:44,110
A yard is three feet.
So what's a meter is close to three to 

1162
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:44,110
three,
but it's not exact.

1163
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:44,750
Okay.
Either way,

1164
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:50,020
eight foot two inches tall and weighed 
approximately 330 pounds and it was a 

1165
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,080
fucking bird.
God Damn.

1166
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,370
Just this big ass spooky looking fucking
bird.

1167
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,380
Imagine that.
That's just the birds.

1168
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,780
Seven and a half feet tall and eats 
meat.

1169
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,700
Running around with that hatchet for a 
face and it wasn't that long ago,

1170
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:06,050
man,
please.

1171
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:07,610
Things were alive when people were 
alive.

1172
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,720
Is that true?
Yeah.

1173
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,950
Fifteen thousand years ago.
They did not become extinct until 15,000

1174
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:17,720
years ago.
That's fucking terrifying.

1175
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:23,240
Oh my God.
Jesus fucking Christ.

1176
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,550
The Romans could have had a fight that 
okay.

1177
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:30,551
Maybe that's not true because there's a.
apparently there's some controversy 

1178
00:51:30,551 --> 00:51:33,581
about that,
that it has been suggested that species 

1179
00:51:33,581 --> 00:51:33,650
did not become extinct till 15,000
years ago,

1180
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:38,651
but more precise dating by a Dr.
Mcfadden and his colleagues refutes such

1181
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:45,881
a late date and that all known the birds
called the tight tennis tight tennis 

1182
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,720
titanic.

1183
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,750
Fossils appear to be at least 2 million 
years old.

1184
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:56,000
Wow.
Giant flightless birds called fos.

1185
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:57,200
Whew.
Okay.

1186
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:00,880
For Russ.
So high.

1187
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,590
I'm not even gonna try.
I'll spell it for you.

1188
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:08,740
P H o r u s r h a,
c I d a e.

1189
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,090
good.
Fucking luck with that one.

1190
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,800
For a psoriasis a did the which are 
named Tara birds has been thought to 

1191
00:52:17,211 --> 00:52:19,940
represent the youngest species of the 
lineage.

1192
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:25,630
That's interesting man.
You know what's interesting to Congo 

1193
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:26,270
still has like big giant flightless 
birds.

1194
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:32,740
That's why I don't go.
They have these weird birds that go 

1195
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:32,960
fishing in the Congo.
Yeah.

1196
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,040
Yeah.
Oh Dude.

1197
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,180
There's a video.
Brian.

1198
00:52:35,181 --> 00:52:39,110
See if he can find the video of ancient 
bird.

1199
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,140
Eat snake fish please.
Brian,

1200
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,170
I want to see it eats snake fish.
Congo,

1201
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:47,690
do you think he's going to look any 
extra heart?

1202
00:52:47,691 --> 00:52:52,691
If you ask them,
please make fish.

1203
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,610
Shoot bills.
That what it is?

1204
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,070
A shoe bill.
EATSA snake fish.

1205
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,480
Yeah,
that's what it was.

1206
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,700
Shoe Bill.
Eat snake fish.

1207
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:07,280
See why we would watch television with 
commercials in it.

1208
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:09,650
Will you just type in birdied snake fit?
Yeah.

1209
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:10,400
Dude,
that's it.

1210
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,830
Shoe bill video.
You've got to see this fucking thing.

1211
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,250
This thing looks like something that 
should be extinct.

1212
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,160
Like when you see a shoe bill,
you,

1213
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,090
you look into.
I,

1214
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,350
and it might as well be.
What was that movie?

1215
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:25,980
Who's

1216
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:31,250
The fucking movie where there was A.
There's a guy who's like not wes craven.

1217
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:34,620
Fuck.
What is his name?

1218
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,090
He had a bunch of really cool

1219
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:44,960
hard novels that had been produced and 
turned into movies.

1220
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:48,110
All I can think of a Stephen King,
but I know that's not right.

1221
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,150
No.
John Carpenter.

1222
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:50,750
No,
no,

1223
00:53:50,751 --> 00:53:51,170
no,
no,

1224
00:53:51,171 --> 00:53:53,090
no.
Gracelyn Gresham.

1225
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:54,140
No.
No.

1226
00:53:54,141 --> 00:53:55,100
Horror.
It was hard.

1227
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,690
Look at this fucking thing.
It's crazy.

1228
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:00,830
Yeah.
Night dwellers or something like that.

1229
00:54:00,831 --> 00:54:02,840
Fuck.
What was the guy's name?

1230
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:08,740
Look at this fucking thing though.
My point is that this thing belongs in 

1231
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:08,960
that movie.
This doesn't seem like a real being.

1232
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:14,080
That seems like something out of Haiti's
that's walking forth amongst the earth 

1233
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,190
among the people.
Is that still alive?

1234
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,780
Uh,
not in my world.

1235
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,170
Snake fish in it.
I find that fucker.

1236
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,830
Take it out.
Zombie.

1237
00:54:21,831 --> 00:54:23,030
I take it out,
bro.

1238
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:27,080
I don't let this thing stay in my 
environment because if it grows larger,

1239
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:32,110
it's a threat to my ancestors.
It's the Rogan and joey show my progeny.

1240
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,450
Look at this thing.
So what do you want from me?

1241
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,260
This fish.

1242
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,550
I got meatballs.
That's all I got for you.

1243
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:45,830
This fish goes up.
This snakehead fish goes up and sucks.

1244
00:54:45,831 --> 00:54:49,690
A big,
deep gulp of actual air cat right there.

1245
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,700
Get this fucking bird.
This bird is a giant bird.

1246
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,050
I think there are about four feet tall.
Where?

1247
00:54:57,051 --> 00:54:58,910
Snuffaluffagus.
Wow,

1248
00:54:58,911 --> 00:55:01,310
that's crazy.
Hey,

1249
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,410
forget about bird comes up to me like 
that.

1250
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:12,100
He gets a hold of that fish.
What a scary fucking creature.

1251
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:16,940
Oh my God.
What a fucking scary.

1252
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:18,230
Yeah,
the fishes scary too.

1253
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:23,680
But that bird is just extra freaky.
It looks like he could fly with those 

1254
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,120
wings.
Can they fly?

1255
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:27,410
God Damn.
That thing is big.

1256
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:33,120
So weird.
What's so fucking weird?

1257
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:38,121
Animal man,
very large stork like bird derives its 

1258
00:55:38,121 --> 00:55:42,900
name from the massive shoe shaped bill,
although at some like somewhat stork,

1259
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:44,370
like overall form

1260
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:49,900
and has been previously classified,
blah,

1261
00:55:49,901 --> 00:55:50,340
blah blah,
blah,

1262
00:55:50,341 --> 00:55:55,341
blah.
The true affiliations with other living 

1263
00:55:55,341 --> 00:55:55,341
birds are ambiguous.
That's interesting.

1264
00:55:55,341 --> 00:55:57,360
So it might not have any affiliation 
with other living birds.

1265
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:02,390
Some authorities now reclassify it with 
the Peli and formed the adult is mainly 

1266
00:56:04,831 --> 00:56:09,831
gray.
While the juveniles are brown or lives 

1267
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:11,970
in tropical east Africa and large swamps
from Sudan to Zambia,

1268
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:17,330
birds,
you're amongst the trippiest fucking 

1269
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:17,330
things that are alive on this planet.
Well,

1270
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,530
they can fly and even if they can't fly 
their trip like we're freaking out about

1271
00:56:19,531 --> 00:56:24,531
those terror birds.
The ones that walked Joey Diaz was all 

1272
00:56:26,641 --> 00:56:29,490
pissed at this bird because he did one 
of those snakes and ranch.

1273
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,880
How big are these fucking things?
It doesn't say how tall they are.

1274
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,460
Identification.

1275
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:40,000
Hmm.

1276
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,240
I'm just fascinated by birds,
man.

1277
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,570
I'm fascinated by the fact that they 
used to be dinosaurs essentially.

1278
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:51,780
Have you ever seen those gigantic eagles
that live in the forest of South America

1279
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:54,250
and they eat monkeys.
Monkeys.

1280
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,330
Oh my God.
Dude.

1281
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,340
Heartbeat Eagles.
Brian,

1282
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:59,080
Google w.
What did that bird do?

1283
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,430
Just eat a duck.
It just was like,

1284
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:01,540
hey,
how's it going?

1285
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,910
To what?
Bird was a Pelican,

1286
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,430
a Pelican and says like,
Hey.

1287
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,240
Oh,
no way.

1288
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:12,330
Oh my God.
Did it just swallowed it whole in front 

1289
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:14,980
of all these people too.
It doesn't give a shit.

1290
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,350
Look at that.
The other ducks are kind of cool with it

1291
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,530
too.
They're not that scary.

1292
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,260
I don't think they're smart enough to 
know what the fuck happened.

1293
00:57:20,261 --> 00:57:21,940
How about that?
I think you're right.

1294
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,520
They probably never thought there was 
going to happen.

1295
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:26,500
Someone's going to come along and 
swallow them.

1296
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,950
No one of their breadwinner.
What did I ask you?

1297
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,600
Just five seconds ago?
Uh,

1298
00:57:31,601 --> 00:57:33,020
to look up.
Um.

1299
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:36,730
Oh,
the heartbeat.

1300
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,100
The Harpy Eagle.
Just,

1301
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:44,190
we'll,
we'll end on this because this is even 

1302
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:44,190
more prosperous is the biggest eagles in
the world is the heartbeat.

1303
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:44,830
Eagles.
Venezuela.

1304
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,630
Brian,
can you please look that up for us?

1305
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:47,350
Thank you.
Second.

1306
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,260
Seems a crazy man.
They've,

1307
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:52,900
they've caught them stealing.
Sloths.

1308
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:57,490
Just snatching them from their trees.
If you go to a heartbeat,

1309
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,190
eagle grabs a swath.
He could see this fucking thing.

1310
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:03,070
What?
Los Eat vegetables.

1311
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:06,580
They're really slow as shit and they 
don't have much defense.

1312
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:10,270
Especially not against a flying raptor.
Especially like the,

1313
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:15,450
I think the biggest ego in the earth.
I don't think there's any bigger egos 

1314
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:19,801
than the Harpy Eagles.
They're enormous and this thing swoops 

1315
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:19,801
down.
He got it.

1316
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,610
His heartbeat eagle training.
No,

1317
00:58:21,611 --> 00:58:23,510
go to a harpy.
Eagle grabs the slot.

1318
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:29,190
There's a video that shows this thing 
stealing one of these slots from the 

1319
00:58:29,231 --> 00:58:30,070
world of the living.

1320
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:35,510
Watch.
This shit is just upside down.

1321
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:40,520
Poor bastard did look how slow they are 
learning they're designed to.

1322
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:45,521
The Eagle Food is there for the taking.
It's not even putting anything in 

1323
00:58:46,221 --> 00:58:47,300
between the two of them.
Oh,

1324
00:58:47,301 --> 00:58:49,070
he's.
He's probably so dumb.

1325
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,330
Look at him.
Okay.

1326
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:55,460
Moves.
Forget about it.

1327
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,030
Oh my God.
That is freaky.

1328
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,520
That's probably fun.
Now for him right now,

1329
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:06,820
for the sloths right now.
Right now he's dying because he's 

1330
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,090
getting his body punctured by these 
giant swords.

1331
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,070
This fucking thing as the end of its 
feet.

1332
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,400
Nothing fun about that feeder.
These claude things,

1333
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:16,070
the the raptor clause or frightening 
man,

1334
00:59:16,071 --> 00:59:21,071
especially a big giant one like that.
There's a reason why those dudes have 

1335
00:59:21,071 --> 00:59:24,251
those goofy shoulder straps on.
You know those things that they put 

1336
00:59:24,251 --> 00:59:27,821
these big leather things on hold to the 
Eagle on their arm or whatever those 

1337
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:28,850
things are called.
What are they called?

1338
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:34,810
Eagle gloves.
Sarah name for one of those things that 

1339
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:35,390
are an eagle lands on called him gloves.
I don't know.

1340
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,590
There's a name for it.
Oh God is he is to say it.

1341
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,190
No,
no.

1342
00:59:40,191 --> 00:59:41,340
Joey Dsa.
What are you waiting for?

1343
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:45,230
Fucking falcon land on your arm.
Eddie Bravo had a leather thing as well.

1344
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:47,660
Is that real?
Is that real?

1345
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:48,900
Is it?

1346
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:58,390
Has It?
Has all those little swords in the end 

1347
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:59,510
of its feet?
Dug deep into and it's just flying.

1348
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:04,540
That's a big ass carp to Leslie Eco.
Look more scared than the fish because 

1349
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,170
the evil evil evil and it knows it's 
evil.

1350
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:08,640
The wicked never read.
Would it be like when I die,

1351
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:11,140
what will it be like when I died with 
that?

1352
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,680
Go to hell.
