1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Let's get home.
He Ha what's up dude?

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,900
What's going on?
Come on your shirt.

3
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,350
What is that?
You've got a lot going on there.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,203
We take a penguin with shark teeth.
This is my homage to Albert Hoffman in 

5
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:18,120
the creation of LSD.
Oh Wow.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,230
In shirt form.
Oh,

7
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,064
well that's Hoffman talk with Jesus 
Christ and then you use all these crazy 

8
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:27,630
animal parts for squares and I'm full 
garden blowing out of his head.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,260
Did you know that a road runner can eat 
a fucking rattlesnake?

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,820
I didn't,
but that's gangster.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,190
There's a video of it.
Somebody tweeted it to me the other day.

12
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:36,510
I'm like,
there's no way this is real,

13
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:37,344
but it's 100% real road runner hunts and
killed a fucking rattlesnake and then 

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,323
eats it and it's eating this thing like 
it's way bigger than it and it's just 

15
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:49,740
trying to swallow it.
You've no idea how gangster,

16
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:50,760
maybe that's a hard runner.

17
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,190
Identifies as a pterodactyl.
Maybe he does.

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,930
Check this out.
Watch this.

19
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,060
First of all,
when you really get a good,

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,160
you look at them from a distance.
It a little bird.

21
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:00,660
You're a little,
I'm not worried about you,

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,673
but when you look at them like close up 
like this and it's high resolution 

23
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:04,764
photography,
you realize like how fucking predatory 

24
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:08,640
these birds are.
Like,

25
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:11,280
look that,
that the snake takes a lunge at him.

26
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:11,850
He's like,
Nah,

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,750
bitch,
not today.

28
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:15,750
Snap gets them right on top of the 
fucking head.

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,010
And look how he does it,
man.

30
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,830
He smashes his head against the rocks,
man.

31
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,883
Yeah.
When people discovered the dinosaurs 

32
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:25,860
were probably birds,
that's even more terrifying.

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,533
I a hundred percent believe it.
I've told you the story about my 

34
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:31,141
chickens,
right?

35
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:34,020
With the feed the mice,
dude,

36
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:34,883
it's really,
the whole thing is really bizarre 

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,073
because it just shows you how like 
people have these attachments to a 

38
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,250
certain species for no reason.

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,920
Like a Steven Nela talks about it with 
bears.

40
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:50,790
He calls him charismatic Megafauna,
but there's something about 60.

41
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,710
So eloquent.
You know,

42
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:53,544
when he's,
uh,

43
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,783
he,
he's,

44
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,913
he's right though.
There's like something about bears that 

45
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:00,840
make some very different in our eyes,
in any other animal and birds,

46
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,920
they have these hierarchies.
So this hawk flew into my fence.

47
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,740
I have a glass fence hog.
Didn't know what the fuck is going on.

48
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,873
Boomp kod jacked.
My daughter's rescue the bird and then 

49
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:15,570
they go to the pet store and buy little 
pinkies,

50
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:19,140
which are these little tiny mice and 
they feed them to the hawk.

51
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,640
So they feed this little tiny mouse had 
decided the mouse is not as important as

52
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,220
the hawk.
The Hawk has stay alive.

53
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,073
Fuck these little baby mice.
So they feed the baby mice to the 

54
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:29,190
hockey.
It's all of them.

55
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,530
But one my daughter went to keep,
but I said,

56
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:32,880
you can't keep,
it's going to die.

57
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,080
It needs,
you know,

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,240
it needs to have milk.
I'll just feed it to the chickens.

59
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,900
So there's a lot of hemming and hawing 
and a lot of crying.

60
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,980
Everybody wants to the mouse to stay 
alive.

61
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:45,270
Ft just fed 30 of them to this fucking 
dinosaur majestic hawk.

62
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,153
It's flying monster.
And so I bring it into the chicken coop 

63
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,453
and I mean I put that thing on the 
ground for not even one half of one 

64
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,070
second and they were tearing it apart 
and running around with it.

65
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,160
It was their monsters.
That rotor thank just confirms

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,680
that I've to 100% new respect for birds 
now.

67
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,110
Yeah.
I think it's,

68
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,180
it is interesting how people,
but it's,

69
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,650
you think about bears,
right?

70
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,710
And people have love bears since way,
way back for like teddy bears.

71
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,153
You know,
before there was the internet and these 

72
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,314
different things.
There's just certain animals that you 

73
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:19,774
have this kinship towards and certain 
like sacred animals when you're down in 

74
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,804
the jungle and different places that 
always seem to inspire something within 

75
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,140
mankind.
Yeah.

76
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,350
And I don't know why it is,
but I,

77
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:31,184
I think I just sort of accept it now.
Like I don't feel the same way about 

78
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,590
bears.
I do about deer.

79
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,550
I think deer are wild and they're cool 
and I love that they exist.

80
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,530
But I have a much more predatory feeling
around them than I do around bears.

81
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:47,010
Bears are like this weird thing.
The,

82
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,100
Oh,
you can eat them too,

83
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,760
you know?

84
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,480
Yeah.
You know,

85
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,850
it's just,
it doesn't have the same feeling.

86
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:56,851
And as an animal,
there's this insane reality of what they

87
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:58,864
are,
this enormous like wild dog thing that 

88
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,530
can kill you.
And some of them are just giants,

89
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,220
just gigantic wild dog thing.
You can kill you and we'd love them.

90
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,923
I remember sitting in the,
obviously we were out there with the 

91
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:13,414
bears,
just sitting there in the woods and 

92
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,580
watching them screw around.
It's,

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,580
it's something different for sure.
It's at least in,

94
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,950
especially too,
when they're kind of looking at you like

95
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:23,920
the connection of looking at the bear 
and the bear looking at you.

96
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,420
I think it's different.
Yeah.

97
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,840
It's very good.
When a deer looks at you,

98
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:27,790
Oh dear,
looks at you like,

99
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,803
what the fuck?
What the fuck are you doing that's 

100
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,210
inside?
And the bear looks at you like,

101
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,223
hey man.

102
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,940
Yeah,
that's what doing here.

103
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,233
That's what's the different,
it's like a different whole thought 

104
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:37,984
cycle.
I sometimes think of thoughts like the 

105
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:39,784
small wheel and the big wheel.
It's almost like bears are just on that 

106
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,020
slightly bigger wheel like us,
you know?

107
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,790
That's what it is.
Right?

108
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,250
That's gotta be a big part of what it 
is.

109
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,084
Like we almost inherently recognize that
they have a level of understanding 

110
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:55,780
that's above the undulates.
You know,

111
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:57,790
like there's something about those 
omnivores.

112
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,980
There's like a level,
especially them,

113
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,190
there's a level of understanding,
but at the end of the day,

114
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:05,500
like if you see how they behave,
like this is a thing,

115
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,423
especially about grizzly bears that I 
got out of that grizzly man movie is 

116
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:10,474
there.
There's so almost robotic in their 

117
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:15,970
predatory drive and their,
their drive to survive.

118
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:17,770
There's survival drive.
It just,

119
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,100
just moving around looking for stuff to 
eat all the time.

120
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,810
Yeah,
there are so big,

121
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,570
you have to eve teach so much when 
you're that big.

122
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,183
But the advantages,
instead of hiding all of the food that 

123
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:31,960
you need for the winter,
like a squirrel,

124
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,883
you ease,
eat and eat and eat and nobody's going 

125
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:37,420
to take your food from you cause it's 
just fat on your body.

126
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,420
Like the only way to get that fat is the
fight the bear.

127
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:41,254
And nobody wants to fight the bear so 
they can survive the winter a whole 

128
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:46,390
different way.
It's just a cool way to approach it,

129
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,900
but a bizarre way.
It's so fascinating when you see all the

130
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:50,734
different methods that nature's figured 
out to sort of overcome the obstacles 

131
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:57,980
that the environment can throw at you.
It's animals that

132
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,720
can survive.
I was in the ocean,

133
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,861
uh,
recently,

134
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,694
we were snorkeling and I'm looking 
around and all these turtles and all 

135
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:05,960
these fish and I'm like,
did they live here?

136
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,123
They fucking live.
I mean I can only stick my head under 

137
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:11,870
there for a few seconds.
I come up,

138
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,240
I got to spray water on the top of the 
nozzle.

139
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,343
They fuck it.
There is a living thing surviving in 

140
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:18,224
there.
It's like life has found a bunch of 

141
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,504
weird,
weird ways to get along and a bear was 

142
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:26,090
one of the weirdest ones.
Just get fat as fuck.

143
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:29,300
They get big round in Jelly and then 
he's take a nap.

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,830
Like fuck this winter.
Fuck that.

145
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,560
I'm not stupid bro.
What am I a moose?

146
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,080
I'm going to walk out there and freeze 
to death like an asshole.

147
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,550
I'm just going to sleep like there's the
strategy involved in that.

148
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,340
It's so much deeper than the strategy of
all the other animals,

149
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,350
the other animals.
That's the pig.

150
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:52,010
One of the big things with I guess a 
deer cause they fucking freeze to death,

151
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,570
man.
That's how they went up dying.

152
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,190
Yeah.
I wonder,

153
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:58,790
you wonder as that evolves that whole 
hibernation pattern.

154
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,624
If they're just like taking a little 
naps first when that's the fellow and 

155
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,420
then f one bear like sleeps two weeks 
and all the other bears.

156
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:07,191
It's like,
what the fuck?

157
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,720
That was awesome and it just sleep a 
little bit longer all the time.

158
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,710
How the fuck does that take place?
This is one of those really dumb,

159
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,080
like people who don't believe in 
evolution.

160
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:20,510
Art are arguments.
You're telling me,

161
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,660
you're telling me that's not by design.
Come on dude,

162
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,550
because somebody who's posted a video,
some guy posted a video,

163
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:30,620
like an animated Gif file of the flat.

164
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,020
He was a flat earth guy and it was just 
the earth,

165
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:36,380
like a flat plane there.
It wasn't even high resolution.

166
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:39,830
It was like low resolution.
It was flat and he's like,

167
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,360
show me again the curvature.
I'm like,

168
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,330
oh my God dude,
this is,

169
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,960
people are fucking crazy.
Yeah.

170
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,873
Well,
I think that whole people just want to 

171
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:52,820
get a leg up,
you know,

172
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,000
and everything you're doing,
you're just trying to edge someone out.

173
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:59,690
So if you can believe in flat earth and 
it actually is flatter,

174
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,410
you got a little bit of leg up on 
everybody else's shit.

175
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:04,244
The Globe,
right?

176
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,910
So they're willing to take that gambit.
They're willing to place that place that

177
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,840
bet.
Like fuck it man,

178
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:09,920
I'm going in.
I'm flat earth.

179
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:13,700
Cause if I'm right and I can say fuck 
you to everybody else just a little bit.

180
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,973
That's the ego.

181
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,960
That is the ego I have to do is watch a 
couple youtube videos.

182
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:22,190
You'd be convinced if you don't do 
anything else other than that,

183
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,463
like that's the thing.
It's like Jordan Peterson talking about 

184
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:29,630
how we could all become a Nazi guard.
Like we can all believe in flat earth if

185
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:32,660
we just stretched our mind a little bit 
and then a little bit more,

186
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,670
I mean maybe all is the wrong word for 
Nazi guard or flat earth,

187
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,060
but I think they could get a lot of us 
that you could get.

188
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:41,894
A lot of us.
I've told you the story about those 

189
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:45,950
fucking rod things that I thought were 
real.

190
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,470
I thought there was rods.
You ever heard her?

191
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:49,304
Roswell rods,
those little w they're supposed to be 

192
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:54,140
insects that are flying through the sky 
so fast.

193
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:55,980
You can't even see him.
And the only way to pick them

194
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,740
up with his video cameras and only way 
to actually see them.

195
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,410
So they would find them on these videos 
like,

196
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:03,420
oh my God,
what did you even notice this a time?

197
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,093
And uh,
they decided that there was these 

198
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:09,060
gigantic things that could be,
you know,

199
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:09,894
who knows how many feet long and they're
like jellyfish and they fly through the 

200
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:13,920
air like fucking lightspeed.
Yeah,

201
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,583
it's those stupid,
it turns out what it was is just an 

202
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,133
artifact when you film things,
when you film things with Shitty old 

203
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:24,060
cameras and when they have new cameras,
he,

204
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:25,350
that's the Rod.
See that thing.

205
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:27,570
It looks like a twig.
That's what they look like.

206
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,790
And some of them you see like way up in 
the sky.

207
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,624
Some of them.
It's just a bug that's flying so fast 

208
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,500
that the camera can pick it up.
Right.

209
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,940
So the camera makes it look like that.

210
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,990
Like that last one,
Jamie.

211
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,580
Yeah,
look at that.

212
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,480
See how it looks like.
It's almost like a jellyfish.

213
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,100
We've been through the air.
It's just a video art or like a Bat with

214
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:46,770
a vapor trail for me.
Yeah it does.

215
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:47,850
That's that one.
Yeah.

216
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:50,850
Cause that one's in front of the tree,
but sometimes you see them in the sky so

217
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,750
you don't have a outside of reference.
Yeah.

218
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,603
You know you don't have like,
that one's interesting because it's in 

219
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:57,030
front of the tree.
Like the trees just only,

220
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,740
you know,
a few yards away you can tell.

221
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,660
And if that rod things right in from the
tree,

222
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:02,700
you can get a guesstimate on how big it 
is.

223
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,460
But a lot of the videos of them,
they had them in the sky,

224
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,130
you know,
just flying in the sky for,

225
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,690
I feel like it's 16 feet long.
It's flying.

226
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,533
The speed of light.
I was in Sedona just having lunch and I 

227
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:17,610
was in Sedona is a place where there's 
some cool shit and then there's a lot of

228
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:18,444
wacky new age shit there.
And I was listening to this guy just 

229
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,310
talk about orbs,
right?

230
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:25,650
Like these orbs and he was able to 
capture,

231
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,860
I've seen those on film and I've had 
orbs in photos and stuff.

232
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,130
All it is,
it's like the,

233
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,530
it's the lens flare effect that creates 
like,

234
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,810
I'm not like super into the science of 
it,

235
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:39,810
but I know that I can reproduce it if I 
create a lens flare and the thing,

236
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:41,250
there's going to be an orb somewhere in 
the picture.

237
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:42,084
Right,
right.

238
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,340
So,
but the way they were describing it,

239
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:45,174
it's like this one,
if you go out it at the right time at 

240
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:51,630
dawn in this special place,
there'll be orbs on the ground.

241
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,400
It's like where they gather.
I'm like,

242
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:55,020
no bitch,
it's the sun come out.

243
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,750
And every time it creates a lens flare 
and your camera,

244
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,780
you know it's,
I would love it if it was that though.

245
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,673
Why is such a party pooper?
Plenty of be amazing if like you could 

246
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:06,354
find balls of light through your round 
you like little like organisms are 

247
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,760
lifeforms and like if you were more 
loving,

248
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:12,594
they surround you do and you just had to
take a picture of people and tell 

249
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:15,720
whether or not,
oh my God,

250
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,563
it's studes awesome.
Like the seeds from a Wa just kind of 

251
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,880
like zone.
They were all just floating all around.

252
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,660
I would deal with that feeling that way 
to see it was a camera,

253
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,520
right?
Yeah.

254
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,743
I'll tell you man,
Eddie Bravo had one picture was it was 

255
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:33,774
Eddie Bravo,
a bunch of orbs around them and he had 

256
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:38,490
his hands open like this and the biggest
orb was in his hands.

257
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,050
And I said,
damn,

258
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,393
imagine if we're all,
just imagine if we're all just super 

259
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,800
skeptical and we're ignoring something,
I'm going to say fucking real.

260
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,640
Oh,
it's just a camera auto fact.

261
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:52,410
It's reproducible.
You can go back.

262
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,940
I sure.
Well that's,

263
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,833
I mean it's kind of like once you've 
done enough Iowasca and done enough dmt 

264
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,884
though,
then you open yourself up to the 

265
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:01,894
possibility that there are things 
potentially outside of our ability to 

266
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,240
perceive them.
That's Eddie,

267
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,260
right?
They're like,

268
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,690
look,
it's like he's holding it.

269
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:14,230
It's like you got high enough to see it 
before I have his girlfriend spitting on

270
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:18,280
the camera,
trying to get some more herbs.

271
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:20,440
Gulen,
like could you recreate orbs?

272
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:22,870
It's spit,
but look,

273
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,120
if you were going to believe in orbs,
that would be,

274
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,580
I mean shit,
that would,

275
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,930
that'd be the one that I'd go with 
whole.

276
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,310
Sure.

277
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,940
He's got to know his hand can see it.
It's clearly a balancing his center,

278
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,940
his love.
It would be the shit if it was real.

279
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,560
It's like all these things would be the 
shit.

280
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,260
If they were real,
like there's some ufo videos over Turkey

281
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,940
and I saw it.
I didn't even click.

282
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,460
I you even click on it.
That's how blahzay have gotten about the

283
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:46,294
UFO or deal.
I don't because I don't believe you 

284
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:50,290
anymore.
I'm not clicking on it.

285
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,860
Yeah,
I would love it if it was real.

286
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,510
Wow.
That's the weird thing about real,

287
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:56,350
right?
You know,

288
00:12:56,351 --> 00:13:00,940
it's like when you go see something was 
such a vivid imagination,

289
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:03,190
like especially in like the psychedelic 
space,

290
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:06,490
you see something and then there's that 
debate,

291
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,120
like is that real?
Right.

292
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,033
And then if enough people,
like if enough people have seen it or 

293
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:12,220
not,
people believe in it.

294
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,010
Like dragons for example.
Like are they real or not?

295
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,990
Well,
they're clearly not in three d space,

296
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,063
but everybody knows and has emotional 
reactions to this one being and they 

297
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:23,680
come to you envision.
And so what is that?

298
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:24,710
Is The dragon real?
What?

299
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:26,260
What?
What's your definition of real?

300
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,311
You know,
like,

301
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:30,550
is it the collection of an idea in your 
brain?

302
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:33,640
All of the lights gathering around that 
you can share and reproduce.

303
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:37,240
And then that thing comes through like 
an archetype in your brain.

304
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,800
Like it's the archetypes.
There's so many of them,

305
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:43,360
right?
There's the Chinese Dragon,

306
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:46,390
the Japanese Dragon,
the Gothic Dragon.

307
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,530
No,
those,

308
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,363
the Medieval Look Dragon.
How many different ones are there 

309
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,670
feeling?
Dragons videos,

310
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,613
infinite dragons,
slightly slight variations on the 

311
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:57,100
dragons.
That's,

312
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,840
that's the thing.
It's like it's,

313
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,790
it is an archetype of being,
I've seen them,

314
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,740
they've come to me many,
many times always.

315
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,470
And it seems to be there,
the being of ultimate power,

316
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,270
like a being of supreme power.

317
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,980
And that's the archetype that it 
recommends.

318
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,730
There's no animal in the animal.
A hierarchy that trumps the dragon.

319
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,590
And he shows up.
Everybody shut the fuck.

320
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,693
Exactly.
He comes flying in with fire coming out 

321
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:18,514
of his face.
Everybody just settles down this giant 

322
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:23,320
flying Lizard.
A con blow fire.

323
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,320
Yeah.
So it represents that kind of power.

324
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,090
My Tattoo artist actually got a cool 
thing.

325
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:28,924
It's like I never tattoo a dragon 
snarling because no dragon would ever 

326
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:35,860
need to snarl.
Like there's nothing he would point,

327
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,060
there was nothing,
a dragon,

328
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:40,480
whatever,
roar at kind of a snarling,

329
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,433
you know,
cause it is that being of fucking 

330
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:44,524
supreme power.
It's a strange thing that there's so 

331
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:50,380
many different cultures that have sort 
of captured that.

332
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,010
And you've got to wonder

333
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,000
how many different things when we 
missing from the fossil record,

334
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,220
you know,
and we know of birds exist,

335
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,810
who knows how many things existed that 
we just haven't found yet.

336
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,003
It's entirely possible that some weird 
fucking lizard existed at some part of 

337
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,710
the world and people could say it,
you know,

338
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:14,711
some weird snake thing that walked and 
then the legend spread of that.

339
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:17,210
And then people saw a bunch of different
giant lizards.

340
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:18,044
Like if you saw a Komodo Dragon,
if you were just wander through the 

341
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:23,750
jungle and you saw a full size Komodo 
dragon and had its mouth open,

342
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,410
you would for sure.
Thank you.

343
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,250
In the presence of a demon.
If you ran away from that,

344
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:29,150
right,
no cameras,

345
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:30,170
right?
No cameras.

346
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,110
Got To take things from your imagination
and drawing for people.

347
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,183
What are you going to draw?
You're gonna draw goddamn demon hissing 

348
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:41,900
giant lizard with saliva coated in 
botulism.

349
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,630
Those are horrible monsters,
man.

350
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,310
Those are fucking ruthless,
ruthless predatory lizards.

351
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,920
Giant lizards.
And you would draw them.

352
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,090
They would be,
they would be,

353
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,200
you know,
have wings.

354
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,210
I mean if you are just a primitive 
person,

355
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:59,120
you ran into one of those things.
If she ran into a Nile Crocodile,

356
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Jesus Christ,
I put a video up,

357
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:04,220
a one Jack and it vulture does he that 
shit.

358
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,210
This vulture fucked up and got too close
to this lake.

359
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,400
They Jack everything except for the 
hippo.

360
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,530
Don't see the crocodiles Jack in the 
Hipaa.

361
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,040
No,
they still clean.

362
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,160
They stay clean.
Look how he gets him.

363
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,020
Look at this.
He's just boomed bitch.

364
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:21,410
Just out of nowhere,
get the fuck at Uhmm.

365
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,530
Gimme that chicken just jumps right back
in there with them.

366
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,610
Oh,
right under the water.

367
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,444
What a what a creepy animal.
Lives in this place where you can't see 

368
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:32,240
it at all.
It's Brown water,

369
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,160
fucking brown water and they can hide in
three feet of that shit for like hours.

370
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:39,800
They don't have to come up and they just
hear the vibrations.

371
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:43,080
They know where you are and they just 
jump up and chat to you.

372
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,003
I think so much of the way that we 
developed was to try and avoid that 

373
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,820
situation.
Fuck our soft bodies.

374
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:53,654
You know all of this brain activity that
we have so much of it you after credit 

375
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:59,660
towards avoiding that exact fucking 
monster.

376
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,080
Yeah,
well hence the like the stereotypes that

377
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:05,090
the stronger the person dumb or the 
person,

378
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,810
you know like if you have time to make 
all that muscle bitch,

379
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:11,070
you ain't got time to read any books.
You're not.

380
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,003
You know,
I learn and what that soft dude over 

381
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:14,360
there,
he's going to save us.

382
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,163
That's,
he's over there doing physics and shit 

383
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,313
trying to figure out how to make swords.
Your bench press will not help the 

384
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:23,990
asteroid collision.
That's going to be a big one.

385
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,500
That was the creepiest podcast we did 
last week for sure.

386
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,740
Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson 
freaked me the fuck out again.

387
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:32,923
It's too easy to not think.
It's too easy to just not think about 

388
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:37,034
the variables.
Too easy to not pay attention to the 

389
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:39,524
fact that we really are just a species.
It's clinging to a spaceship without a 

390
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:48,971
roof that were just clinging to this 
circular orb as it a thousand miles

391
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,690
an hour and hurls through infinity or we
were just hanging out on it and we don't

392
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:56,610
want,
we don't want to think about it.

393
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:58,920
It's due grazie.
Yeah.

394
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,780
The depressing part of that whole 
cataclysmic particularly is we're,

395
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,360
we got all these fucking nuclear 
reactors everywhere,

396
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,433
so like one goes off and then those 
things get all disrupted and then the 

397
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:13,230
nuclear radiation is the big issue that 
you have to worry about.

398
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:15,000
Right.
Do you see what they did to Chernobyl?

399
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,530
They created a dome that's two football 
fields long.

400
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,993
It's gigantic and they're getting case 
the entire enclosure plus the astro 

401
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,150
realm of led on that.
Yeah.

402
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:28,980
That's what it looks like.
It's huge.

403
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:31,980
It's crazy.
It's a crazy engineering undertaking.

404
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,020
If you look at it and go,
what?

405
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,913
Like you just have to imagine like what 
kind of resources and how many brains 

406
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:39,360
were involved.
Look at this thing.

407
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:44,810
They're going to lift this fucking thing
over the dome is this enormous.

408
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:49,560
They have these designs for it.
They show the fully competed thing fully

409
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,350
completed.
What does it say there?

410
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,660
30 countries are involved in this.
Wow.

411
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

412
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:57,024
I think,
I mean,

413
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,863
the key is we've got to elevate 
consciousness to a point where we're 

414
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:02,690
actually looking at these situations and
being able,

415
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,860
and I think that's the point that Graham
and Randall make.

416
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:07,840
And I couldn't agree more.
Like people have to be at a,

417
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:12,300
at a level where we can actually do 
something about that instead of fighting

418
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,100
with each other.
You're 100% right.

419
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:15,990
Look at that image.
That's what it's going to look like.

420
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,350
They're just going to drop that down 
over the site.

421
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:23,070
Like Jesus Christ.
That's big and so big.

422
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,280
That's so crazy how big it is.
Look how thick it is.

423
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,840
That's insane.
I mean,

424
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:29,280
what are the,
what the fuck does that way?

425
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,440
And the weird part,
it's,

426
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:33,780
it just feels to me that it's not fully 
going to work.

427
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,430
Just like putting,
like,

428
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,090
putting like a tupperware over a Fart,
you know?

429
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,933
Like,
are you going to get the whole part in 

430
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:41,790
the tupperware?
I doubt it.

431
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,790
I think the farts out there,
uh,

432
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,020
Shane Smith went down there and uh,
he was in trouble and they were,

433
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,854
they were hunting these wolves.
There's these radioactive wolves 

434
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,773
episode.

435
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,750
I was like,
what are you talking about?

436
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,923
He's like,
all these animals that live around that 

437
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:01,380
area,
they're all radioactive.

438
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,360
Like,
oh my God,

439
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,090
it just hulks out and turns green.
Well,

440
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:08,580
they probably are experiencing some 
mutations.

441
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,623
There was some viral video that was 
going around the Internet that was 

442
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:12,264
saying that these are fish that lived 
near Chernobyl and it showed these just 

443
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:15,984
enormous,
crazy fish slopping around this little 

444
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:20,190
river and they were there.
That was the vial.

445
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:23,370
But apparently it's bullshit.
Apparently they're just giant catfish or

446
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:26,040
something like that that just do exist 
in some spot.

447
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,040
They're not radioactive.
That is deep in our psyche though.

448
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:29,874
That idea that radioactive matter is 
going to turn something into some 

449
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:36,070
amorphous new thing.
Yeah.

450
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,800
And it's always,
it's always bad.

451
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,120
It's,
except in comic books,

452
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,130
if you're a dude,
if you're a dude,

453
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:42,270
it always works out well.

454
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,660
He always become spider ran or the hulk 
or you know,

455
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,790
you just got to pick the animal.
You go into that radioactive soup with.

456
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,710
That's true too.
Yeah.

457
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,060
Yeah.
You got to get a good deal.

458
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:53,790
Like the stretchy guy.
What's the guy?

459
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,200
The and the avengers,
not the vendors.

460
00:20:56,201 --> 00:21:00,340
The fantastic four stretching guy.
That's a shit fucking superpower.

461
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,750
That is shit.
Oh,

462
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:02,584
you get to bend.
People get to stretch you out like 

463
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:06,010
Taffy.
I'll fucking,

464
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:06,844
where do I sign up?
You got to go in with a road runner for 

465
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:10,570
sure.
Oh,

466
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,640
he's got a guy next to him and it turns 
into fire.

467
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,110
Like what the Fuck I get?
I just can.

468
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,950
This guy can turn into fire and fly 
through the fucking hair.

469
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,963
All I can do is stretch.
That is the most bullshit superpower of 

470
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:25,720
all time.
He could stretch.

471
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,750
He makes his arms go into circles.

472
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,540
He could turn them into a figure eight 
like what?

473
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,583
I don't know.
I fought with Dawson and street fighter 

474
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,580
and his stretchy ability was definitely 
helpful.

475
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,320
Does he have stretchy ability?
Is pretty fine.

476
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,333
He could push both his arms out like 
that and they go away in front of the 

477
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:45,130
shoe and the leg,
just straight double Dick Punch and then

478
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:46,990
he's got that,
the foot like that,

479
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,710
like a long ass front kick,
someone out of the sky crowd to say,

480
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:53,500
I can't name any of the characters in 
street fighter,

481
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:56,500
nor can I tell you what they do.
I don't know anything about that.

482
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,880
I played that a couple of times.
I was like,

483
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,060
this is the old man that hit me right in
this sweet spot and I couldn't,

484
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,670
I couldn't ignore it.
I was just at that age,

485
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,150
you know where you have all the 
testosterone brewing but the frustration

486
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:09,100
because we little and you couldn't beat 
anybody up,

487
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,460
right?

488
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,100
So you just play something in a video 
game and then you can beat everybody you

489
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:12,934
up if you're that avatar.
I wonder how many fights have been 

490
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:18,340
started from street fighter?
Like if there was like a running tout.

491
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,260
Do you know what I mean?
Like Mcdonald's has.

492
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:21,094
How many burgers sold?
How many likes fights started by a game 

493
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,440
of street fighter.
Less than Madden for sure.

494
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:27,274
Less than that because I see right 
playing that and it often ends in 

495
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:30,370
fights.
Yeah.

496
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,360
That should be a whole youtube channel.
Like Madden street fights.

497
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:40,120
They should come with some gloves.
Dudes love their flip all man.

498
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,993
They love,
I listened to bill birth podcasts and 

499
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:44,650
sometimes he'll go like an hour just 
talking about football.

500
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,590
They fucking told us we couldn't do it.

501
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,220
Who told you?
Yeah,

502
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,113
us as the US is the funny thing too 
cause that's again like the identity 

503
00:22:58,121 --> 00:22:58,954
playing this trick.
It's that that lust for tribalism that 

504
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:03,070
we all have.
Like we want to be part of a tribe.

505
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,083
Oh that team is our tribe and you'll 
fight for it and you'll feel shitty 

506
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:09,130
about it and you'll feel elated about 
it.

507
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,183
I mean it makes the Games interesting 
but it also opens you up to a weird 

508
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:15,010
spectrum of emotion.
Yeah.

509
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,770
You're that kind of pride for your 
neighborhood,

510
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,070
for your town or your state.
All that gets weird.

511
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,350
Yeah.
Till till you get to America.

512
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,940
That's where we crossed the fucking 
line.

513
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:25,774
Boy.
Mirka you better be proud that'd be 

514
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:29,704
proud of from here.
Donald Trump says he's going to put 

515
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,580
people in jail for a year if they burned
the flag.

516
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,833
Here's what's hilarious.
Hillary Clinton proposed this in 2005 I 

517
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:41,260
didn't know that somebody tweeted that 
to me on twitter.

518
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,280
I think they're having an affair.
They probably been out the whole time.

519
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,480
I feel like either way we win.
Yeah.

520
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,513
That's what's been going on.
All those little shitty little caddy 

521
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:52,440
remarks.
Yup.

522
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,740
What lovers say to each other.
That's exactly right.

523
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,753
When they get nasty with each other and 
then them taking me you fucking 

524
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:03,000
deplorable.
Deplorable basket,

525
00:24:03,001 --> 00:24:05,870
but a bucketed deplorables.
What was it and people,

526
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:07,130
it was,
people just jumped on it.

527
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,203
They've been the worst at like creating 
like memes and stuff and like the worst 

528
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:14,414
at coming up.
They were the worst that like coming up 

529
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:19,760
with a campaign.
Thoughts,

530
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,290
you know?
There was just too,

531
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,170
too many things going on with that 
election where it was just like,

532
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,600
wow,
you guys are not not that good at this.

533
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,150
Like this.
I'm with her.

534
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,760
Don't say I'm with her.
Don't say that's Jesus Christ.

535
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,180
How obvious we making it.
It were just voting for a check.

536
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,720
Like how obvious.
Well it's more than that.

537
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,150
It's more than that

538
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,170
man.
This everything is getting squirrely and

539
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:45,004
I think one of the most brilliant parts 
of Jordan Peterson's podcast yesterday 

540
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,543
was that he identified in his mind and I
tend to agree with them that one of the 

541
00:24:51,701 --> 00:24:52,534
reasons why things are getting so 
squirrely as we've removed the 

542
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:55,294
metaphysical underpinnings behind our 
understandings of everything you know 

543
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,830
and so like all of this social justice 
and all these pronouns,

544
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,933
I think a lot of that is that we've 
removed the metaphysical understanding 

545
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:08,194
of self.
You know and so if you really don't 

546
00:25:09,701 --> 00:25:14,470
understand who yourself is,
then you really can't have self love,

547
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,304
self worth,
self confidence because it's all built 

548
00:25:17,171 --> 00:25:20,830
on something else and that surrogate for
self that they create his identity,

549
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,350
who you are,
what Pronoun you are,

550
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:26,500
what you know,
what tribe you identify with,

551
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:28,720
what you do,
what your race is.

552
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:29,554
And then all of these parts of identity,
which really have absolutely nothing to 

553
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:37,000
do with self in the metaphysical sense 
become the thing that you defend.

554
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,370
You defend that thing as if it is 
yourself.

555
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,980
But it's not.
And I think that's,

556
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,873
you know,
one of the paths that I've taken is to 

557
00:25:44,471 --> 00:25:46,720
understand those metaphysical 
underpinnings.

558
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:47,554
I understand what the self is rather 
than just trying to work on self worth 

559
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:53,374
and self confidence and self love.
But you got to fucking first understand 

560
00:25:56,381 --> 00:25:57,214
the cell.

561
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,860
He was a deep dude,
Ben,

562
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,870
that the stuff that he was saying about 
religion,

563
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,783
about the need for this understanding of
good and evil and then how it plays out 

564
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,880
and to just stay on that balance of good
and evil and to,

565
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,743
to live.
You know what he was talking about a 

566
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:17,130
true life,
really fascinating because it was one of

567
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:17,964
those things where he's,
he's thinking at an extremely high 

568
00:26:19,951 --> 00:26:22,620
level.
And so when you're following them,

569
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:24,630
you have to be sure you're following 
him.

570
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,090
Like,
damn,

571
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,610
I'm really getting what he's saying 
here.

572
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,043
You know,
cause he's talking about being someone 

573
00:26:30,571 --> 00:26:34,080
who hates ideologies,
but he's a very religious man.

574
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,430
I think really the most confusing part 
of what he was saying was the use of the

575
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:41,010
word religion because it a little bit 
like Danielle,

576
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:42,600
he and his book create your own 
religion.

577
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,070
He's created

578
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,030
his variation of religion that allows 
him to use that word,

579
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,500
you know?
But for most people,

580
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:52,260
the colloquial understanding of religion
is much,

581
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:54,010
much different.
And I think it was confused.

582
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,800
I think he would probably benefit from 
maybe looking at that word and seeing if

583
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:00,600
it's conveying what he actually means.
But yeah,

584
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,593
I think you're right.
But I think I understood what he was 

585
00:27:02,861 --> 00:27:04,930
saying and I think he definitely 
understood what he was saying.

586
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:05,950
The problem is,
you know,

587
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,053
he's,
he's looking at it in terms of that 

588
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:13,231
these archetypal stories are integral to
being human 100% and that they've been a

589
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:14,524
part of our life for so long that this 
recent jettison that our society has 

590
00:27:19,391 --> 00:27:20,620
taken away from it.
You know,

591
00:27:20,621 --> 00:27:21,454
we've sort of launched ourselves away 
and become more and more cynical about 

592
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,840
our roots and our understanding of who 
we are in this world.

593
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:30,820
And like what is important and what is 
bullshit,

594
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,280
you know?
And that's all great.

595
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,160
I think that's super important and 
that's,

596
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,050
that's what human beings are here for.
We're here to be curious.

597
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,633
But one of the things that I think 
people really do really well with his 

598
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:47,290
structure and when people don't have a 
structure,

599
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,580
like a reason

600
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,360
to behave in a,
uh,

601
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,310
an ethical and kind way yeah.
Or,

602
00:27:54,311 --> 00:27:55,001
uh,
you know,

603
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:55,834
a better to strive for.
They struggle without structure and 

604
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:02,140
without truth as the bedrock truth forms
the bedrock.

605
00:28:02,141 --> 00:28:02,974
And I think that's what he really meant 
about these religious truth as compared 

606
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:06,700
to scientific truths,
these,

607
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,683
these true understandings that form the 
bedrock that you can build everything 

608
00:28:10,241 --> 00:28:12,220
else off of like,
again,

609
00:28:12,221 --> 00:28:14,770
going back to self,
like what is the self?

610
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,480
Well,
when you look deeper and deeper,

611
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,770
it's nothing but you know,
the embodied consciousness,

612
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,903
the consciousness within us.
And then when you understand that your 

613
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:24,994
consciousness,
then you can ditch all of these other 

614
00:28:27,311 --> 00:28:30,190
things that you're trying to pile on top
of and make it so important,

615
00:28:30,191 --> 00:28:34,180
like all of these identity things.
But you have to get to at least where my

616
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:35,014
metaphysical understanding is that the 
self is consciousness embodied in this 

617
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,063
awesome meet vehicle we get to play 
around with and experience life and 

618
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:42,874
interact with each other and tastes 
things and fight things and fuck things 

619
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,810
like it's amazing.

620
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,280
But ultimately,
you know,

621
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,710
we're just that that spark of 
consciousness.

622
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,560
Yeah.
Who the fuck knows.

623
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,653
Yeah.
But what he was saying was cool cause 

624
00:28:57,071 --> 00:29:00,850
we'll do what he was saying it was when 
Peterson was talking about it,

625
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:03,550
it was this different level of 
understanding I think.

626
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:05,650
And he's so incredibly well read.
No doubt.

627
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,940
I really liked what he was saying too 
about you know how and one of the,

628
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,890
one of the metaphysical understandings 
that I have it,

629
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,870
I mean I think you arrive at it from 
different ways.

630
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:14,704
I think religion can obviously be a 
great vehicle to help you arrive at 

631
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:19,390
that.
You can do it through philosophy.

632
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,224
You can do it through experience.
And I've kind of gone mostly through 

633
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:26,320
that experience route with a different 
plant medicines and things.

634
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:27,154
And you arrive at these different truths
and that idea that you reconcile the 

635
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:32,074
darkness within you,
that thing inside yourself that is 

636
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,180
inherently has all the capacity for 
evil.

637
00:29:37,181 --> 00:29:42,181
That was brought to me and in like in a 
psychedelic experience where I was going

638
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,340
in and I realized that I myself was all 
the darkness and all the light.

639
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,213
I was good and bad,
a raid on a spectrum and was capable of 

640
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:54,220
doing every good thing in every bad 
thing.

641
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:56,980
And it was the most horrifying 
experience I've ever had.

642
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,760
Like recognizing that I was all of those
things.

643
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,570
But the only thing that made it,
that decided who I was was choice.

644
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,463
And that choice was enough.
But you had to first reconcile the 

645
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:12,970
capability of being everything before 
you can layer on that element of,

646
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,740
all right,
I am everything,

647
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,900
but I choose to be this.
I choose truth.

648
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:20,080
I choose love.
I choose to have faith against the fear.

649
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,760
And that's,
you know,

650
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:22,594
that's ultimately then who you are.
But going down into those subterranean 

651
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:28,810
depths and realizing that we all have 
fucked up thoughts.

652
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:31,330
You know,
we're all a little bit off here or there

653
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,130
and I think it's super important to 
reconcile.

654
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,820
Just like watching that fucking road 
runner Jack,

655
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:37,560
that snake.
We're animals,

656
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:42,540
we're living organisms and we are living
organisms that are aware of is crazy.

657
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:47,541
See of genes that we live in is see a 
fucking sells competing for survival and

658
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:54,570
these weird forms with these weird rules
and we're in that.

659
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,673
But what we're,
as far as we know when the only ones 

660
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,040
that are aware that we're in it,
unless dolphins are aware,

661
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,350
they can be aware.
If you've ever heard of something called

662
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:08,400
the false killer whale [inaudible] dude,
I was in Hawaii this week.

663
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,443
We did a little fishing with the kids,
had a great time and we're on this boat 

664
00:31:12,631 --> 00:31:14,160
and this Guy Steve,
who was on the boat with me,

665
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,463
uh,
who was one of the guys working on the 

666
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:21,150
boat told me that they had a run in with
these false killer whales when they were

667
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:26,151
pulling in these 50 pound tunas and this
fucking gigantic 20 foot long thing.

668
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,470
That thing ever seen one of those?
No.

669
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,410
What the fuck dude,
how did I not know that that existed?

670
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,113
This crazy looking weird whale thing 
with giant ass teeth and they call them 

671
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,060
false killer whales.
Um,

672
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,040
I dunno.
I guess it's like some sort of a dolphin

673
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:48,210
subspecies or something.
So this a killer whale is too,

674
00:31:48,211 --> 00:31:50,370
they're all cousins I guess.
But this,

675
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:55,110
this thing snacked this fucking 50 pound
tuna right off the hook.

676
00:31:55,111 --> 00:31:57,570
Just ripped it off in front of him while
he was pulling it in.

677
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,730
And so they said,
oh Jesus Christ,

678
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,260
these things are going to find it.
Let's,

679
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:03,720
let's get outta here.
We'll go somewhere else.

680
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,360
They went five miles away.
These fucking things.

681
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:08,790
Follow them.
Five miles and Jak,

682
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:12,900
two more fish.
Wild,

683
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,730
wild,
wild world out there.

684
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,610
This weekend I had a porpoise steal a 
tuna from me.

685
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,420
We were t catching these little 
amberjack tuna's,

686
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,263
they're not that big like a big one is 
like 20 pounds is like as big as they 

687
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:27,390
get to like most of like 10 pounds,
but they're really tasty.

688
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,253
Anyway,
we're catching these things and I'm 

689
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:30,414
pulling them in and he's going crazy.
This thing is going crazy and the 

690
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:38,430
skipper says there's probably a porpoise
chasing yet.

691
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,830
I'm like,
no fucking way.

692
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,010
He's

693
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,311
like,
yeah,

694
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:43,640
they do it all the time.
They grow up going around this.

695
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:45,950
There's this one area where these,
uh,

696
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,700
these tune is live skipjacks that's what
they're called,

697
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:53,701
non amberjack skipjack tuna and this one
area where they populate.

698
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,853
These fucking dolphins have grown up to 
know that they can hang around those 

699
00:32:58,161 --> 00:32:58,994
boats and they wait until someone 
catches one and then when they fighting 

700
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,680
fighting,
it can't move very quick.

701
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,950
So these swim up to it.
Well it's on the line and they just jack

702
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,960
them and he jacked it right in front of 
me.

703
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,980
Right in front of me.
I'm like,

704
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:10,814
no fucking way.
And I see this dark shadow underneath 

705
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:14,384
the water come near this flashing fish.
I had to yank this crazy tug and then 

706
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:20,550
the line goes limp.
Thanks.

707
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,630
Oh,
this porpoise.

708
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:26,030
Just Jack that tuna right in front of 
me.

709
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,430
Do that for the Chinook salmon out in 
British Columbia to yeah,

710
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,920
they pull your salmon off the line.

711
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,843
They're smart.
I mean they figured out that if your 

712
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:35,360
line is taught,
the fish ain't moving anywhere.

713
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:36,770
It's fighting.
It's trying to go this way.

714
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:39,290
The drag and the real.
That's like easy one to get.

715
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,313
Yeah.
And you never hooked those animals to 

716
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:42,650
theirs.
They're too smart for that.

717
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,050
But I said he's hooked him before.
Oh,

718
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,080
really?
Hooked him before.

719
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:47,960
I didn't know that they accidentally had
snagged one before.

720
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,190
Oh.
Like body snag.

721
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:52,520
Like I said,
it got bodies like a dolphin.

722
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,400
The dolphin will eat your fish to see 
people.

723
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,590
They'll get caught in nets.
They just can't see him.

724
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,360
But you don't see him get cotton,
those hooks.

725
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,320
Yeah.
They never get,

726
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:03,140
that was one of my bits that you,
if people live in the water,

727
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:03,974
you'd catch them all day.
Like this difference between dolphins 

728
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:07,064
and people.
It's like they eat fish but we don't 

729
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:09,710
catch them when you go fishing.

730
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,930
Like it's Kinda crazy.
But the um,

731
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,260
the guy said that they had to pull one 
in some,

732
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,123
I forget what the circumstances were but
it got foul hooked and they had to pull 

733
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:20,770
it in and a release the hook.
Yeah.

734
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,130
Taking the,
be really careful with it.

735
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

736
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,793
Going back to what you were saying 
though about the self being this like 

737
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:27,374
collection of cells.
I think that's really kind of 

738
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:34,391
interesting because the self is so many 
different cells that are kind of sending

739
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:35,234
competing signals to the brain.
All of them trying to almost vie for 

740
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,284
their own survival and then the brain 
puts out like a prime directive of what 

741
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:45,980
the things that are best for that.
But now that we're understanding so much

742
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:49,100
of our gut biome and how much that 
contributes to the self,

743
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:50,240
it contributes.
You know,

744
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:52,490
neurotransmitter production,
immune cell production,

745
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,820
but every time we shit we drop a bunch 
of that gut biome into the toilet.

746
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,870
I mean it's,
it's going to feed on the,

747
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,000
on the feces and then we drop it in 
there.

748
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,810
So it's like ourself is changing,
you know,

749
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,703
every time we take a dump,
like that collection of things that we 

750
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:12,110
call self,
which are some pathogenic organisms,

751
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,480
some helpful organisms,
some skin cells,

752
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,290
all of it's contributing to self.
All of it's contributing messages to the

753
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:20,780
brain and it's changing and all the 
time.

754
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:23,390
And I think that's why people,
when they go looking for the self,

755
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:27,500
it's so squirly cause what is the self,
I mean it changes every single day.

756
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:31,340
You're a different self when you're 
angry or happy or mad or in love as when

757
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:33,650
you're inspired or after a workout 
you're different self.

758
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:34,484
Then when you start,
we're just this amalgamation but it's 

759
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,110
almost an ideology of self to call it 
one thing and call it,

760
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,220
oh this is me.

761
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,780
Yeah,
we're really,

762
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:45,330
we're just this a lot more nebulous than
that.

763
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,530
And that's why people get confused and 
they want to cling to something concrete

764
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:51,990
and ideology self.
Here I am.

765
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:55,200
I am.
Well you got a v a vague idea of who you

766
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:56,070
are.
Yeah.

767
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,950
Like you kind of know you know a 
neighborhood.

768
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,480
Ah,
I've been down this road.

769
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,550
I know that's road,
but you know,

770
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,830
he could go down a bad road one day,
you know,

771
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,850
go down to someone towed your car and 
they weren't supposed to road and you're

772
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:10,080
like,
oh I didn't even know this dude.

773
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,330
He there's,
there's weird parts of you that come out

774
00:36:15,331 --> 00:36:19,080
and weird altercations or weird moments 
of vulnerability and you go,

775
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:19,914
wow,
I didn't even know that person was in 

776
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:21,204
there.
Yeah.

777
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,960
Like just looking at,
even as much as I think about it,

778
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:27,090
I'll still get stuck and weird self 
land.

779
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,953
Like this past Saturday,
I don't know what it was all the 

780
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:33,960
Thanksgiving from like noon to 7:00
PM on Saturday,

781
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:36,270
I was a comment.
I was the worst.

782
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,900
I was the worst.
I mean,

783
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,080
I didn't even want to hang out with 
myself.

784
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,350
Like,
and then at some point like around seven

785
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:44,940
o'clock I was like,
oh my God,

786
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,720
like what is going on?
Will you let,

787
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,750
did you eat too much shitty food?
Maybe.

788
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,100
Yeah.
I don't know what it is.

789
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:51,450
I don't want to make excuses.
I just,

790
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,450
you know,
as the my mail menstrual cycle,

791
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,010
it was in what way were you like short 
with people where you just like,

792
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,030
I just didn't want to be around.

793
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,080
Everything was like such a big deal.
Not a big deal,

794
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,590
you know like whatever,
whatever little thing came up was like a

795
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:11,670
life ending life shattering thing and it
was just weird.

796
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,940
It's just weird understanding.
And then it lifted like a fog.

797
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,120
Like just like when the clouds move and 
the son Pierce through and I was like,

798
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:20,280
what the hell was that?
He's like,

799
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:25,281
so that self is a slightly different 
self then the self that came after it,

800
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:28,830
the self that's here now the self on a 
cup of coffee versus that.

801
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,480
And so I think,
you know,

802
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,943
it just,
we try to oversimplify that when really 

803
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,750
we're so much more than what we are and 
there aren't boundaries.

804
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:39,030
This idea that you can contain 
everything.

805
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:39,864
This is me,
this is not me I think really doesn't 

806
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:42,714
make a lot of sense,
but we filled some techniques to making 

807
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,940
yourself more positive all the time.

808
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,003
Like I think that's one of the things 
about the Wim Hoff breathing that I 

809
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,583
really like is that when you,
when you do an any kind of breathing 

810
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:55,890
exercise,
I think any,

811
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:58,170
like even a the beginning of beak from 
Yoga,

812
00:37:58,171 --> 00:37:59,004
when you do that crazy breathing,
when you breathe and then your net goes 

813
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:03,810
back.
I think what,

814
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,713
what that really makes you do is 
concentrate on the moment and it 

815
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:09,894
releases excess tension to the point 
where you have a better ability to be 

816
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:14,760
yourself.
You know?

817
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,650
Totally.
I think there's a lot of burdens that we

818
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:17,484
don't recognize that cling to us and 
we're carrying them around and we don't 

819
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:23,580
realize it until we get them free and 
then we'll go,

820
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,540
ah,
I just,

821
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,520
I needed to go run.
You know,

822
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:29,160
like there's some times you just go,
I just needed to lift,

823
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,410
I need to do something now.
Nothing's bothering me.

824
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:36,080
Like this same world exists but 45 
minutes or rigorous exercise

825
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,510
and he don't give a fuck about it 
anymore.

826
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,320
And this thing that was this 
overwhelming moment in your life,

827
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:45,470
like it's all a matter of perspective.
[inaudible]

828
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,943
and the best perspective that I find is 
when I can tap into that consciousness 

829
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:52,100
element,
what you can call it,

830
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:53,970
your people call it your higher self,
whatever.

831
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:58,080
There's a billion names for it,
but it's the best version of yourself.

832
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,390
You know,
like who you are at your very,

833
00:39:00,391 --> 00:39:01,224
very best when you're filled with the 
most love and the most peace and the 

834
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:07,800
most like inner just contentment and 
satisfaction,

835
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:11,130
like your best self.
And then when you can ask,

836
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:13,140
find ways to access that,
I think absolutely right.

837
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:14,490
Yoga,
breathing,

838
00:39:14,491 --> 00:39:16,080
flotation,
you know,

839
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,153
nature flow state,
all of these ways are ways to tap into 

840
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,930
that best self,
which is usually,

841
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,043
you know,
anchored in the present moment and is 

842
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:27,030
you at your very best.
And from that vantage point,

843
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,480
you see the obstacles laid out in front 
of you and maybe they don't go away,

844
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:32,340
but maybe you can look at them,
you know,

845
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,030
as you should like an advantage and 
opportunity to grow stronger,

846
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,953
you know?

847
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,520
Yeah.
Just perspective.

848
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,280
I think their purse,
I think all of those things,

849
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,640
including marijuana and a lot other 
psychedelic compounds,

850
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,280
their perspective enhancers.
Yeah,

851
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:47,670
and I think that's what they're here 
for.

852
00:39:47,671 --> 00:39:51,270
We just,
we equate them with the negative aspects

853
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:52,740
of,
we know that some drugs have on people,

854
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:53,940
so we know that,
you know,

855
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,893
sometimes they can be bad,
but I feel that same way about religion 

856
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,780
and I feel that same way about 
government.

857
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:02,160
I feel that same way about a lot of 
things,

858
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,130
just because certain aspects of it are 
fucked.

859
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,360
It doesn't mean it doesn't have some 
massive benefits for us.

860
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,800
Like even like you could call it like 
religion.

861
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:16,290
A lot of ways it's like bill cosby.
Okay.

862
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,100
Is Bill Cosby did some horrible shit,
some horrible shit.

863
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,240
Most likely.
Right.

864
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,310
But he made a lot of fucking people 
laugh.

865
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,720
Yeah,
right.

866
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,130
It's a lot of people.

867
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:26,963
If you looked at the number of victims 
versus the number of people that 

868
00:40:29,911 --> 00:40:31,800
benefited from it,
hit him.

869
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:32,341
You'd go,
wow,

870
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:33,174
what a complex situation that says you 
have this monster who also is doing 

871
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:38,180
amazing work.
Yeah.

872
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,123
Like he's making people show happy 
everywhere and he's enforcing this like 

873
00:40:41,251 --> 00:40:45,000
really positive way of behaving and 
thinking for people.

874
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,150
Like you could never imagine yourself 
swaying around bill cosby,

875
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,420
you know he was this upstanding PhD guy.
I think in a lot of ways that's the same

876
00:40:55,441 --> 00:40:56,274
way about religion.
Like if it wasn't for religion and I'm 

877
00:40:58,801 --> 00:40:59,634
not an advocate of religion currently,
like to use it currently in the same 

878
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:03,534
form that everybody's using it,
but I'm just saying if you looked at 

879
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:05,964
like humankind as a whole,
if it wasn't for believing that we had 

880
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,390
these crazy rules,
then we had to do good.

881
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:15,900
Otherwise the dad would come and strike 
a stat if it wasn't like the fear,

882
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:16,763
literally live literal fear of God that 
kept people from just raping and 

883
00:41:21,151 --> 00:41:23,040
pillaging and doing whatever the fuck 
they wanted to.

884
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,143
Who knows how much longer it would have 
taken us to get to the place where you 

885
00:41:26,971 --> 00:41:29,630
can fight over gender pronouns.
Yeah.

886
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,220
Right.

887
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,610
It's almost like a system that may at 
some have been necessary.

888
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:35,930
Yeah.
We don't know that people,

889
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:36,764
we weren't around people 3000 years ago.
We don't know what they would've done 

890
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:44,390
without the threat and that fear of God 
because there was no dna evidence.

891
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:45,520
There was no,
you know,

892
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,470
inspectors and detective.
So maybe it was necessary,

893
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:49,304
but clearly now the dogma that's 
surrounding it is an impediment to our 

894
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:55,130
happiness and impediment to,
you know,

895
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:55,964
the,
the better truths that are going to 

896
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:59,140
hopefully make this world,
you know,

897
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,470
a more positive place for everybody.
Well they,

898
00:42:01,471 --> 00:42:02,304
because I think you nailed it when you 
said like a program because I think 

899
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:05,894
that's really what it is.
It's almost like a program that human 

900
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:13,301
beings sort of manifested to travel to 
the next stage of development.

901
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:15,921
Like,
look,

902
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:18,110
we're just not going to get here to 
thing and claw.

903
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:18,944
I ain't going to work,
boy.

904
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,491
Okay.
You know,

905
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:21,770
we've got agriculture but we're still 
behaving like monsters.

906
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,520
You know and they had to just figure out
things to worship,

907
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:27,290
things to love,
things to cherish,

908
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,840
things to believe in and the new pass 
these things down.

909
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:30,674
I was like this higher daddy,
this higher daddy thing cause that's 

910
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:34,730
what it is,
man.

911
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,890
The problem is a couple of people got 
it,

912
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,800
saw that,
jacked it jacked and then manipulated it

913
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:41,790
for their own power and they want to 
talk to the gunk.

914
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:43,821
Yeah,
exactly.

915
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:45,810
I mean that whole move of all right,
you,

916
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,693
you can't talk to God to talk to God.
You got to come see me and you got to 

917
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:49,634
build me a big house and you've got to 
pay me every year and then I'll 

918
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:53,390
translate that message,
you know,

919
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,850
to the divine on your behalf.
Thank you very much.

920
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:56,743
My favorite version of that is you ever 
see the dude who took pictures of 

921
00:42:58,881 --> 00:43:00,930
himself in heaven?
No.

922
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,530
That's awesome.
He fucking,

923
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,870
he went to heaven pastor.
He came back,

924
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:06,704
he had a suit on and a white background,
white background and he said he was in 

925
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:11,144
heaven.
He took photos and he put them up on 

926
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:13,094
instagram.

927
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:15,913
The photos.
He was selling the photos of him in 

928
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:19,760
heaven.
Yeah,

929
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:20,683
I come on son.
I think in order for that to work for 

930
00:43:23,211 --> 00:43:24,044
people,
you have to break the brain early and I 

931
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:28,760
think you break the brain by saying 
something like fear of God.

932
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,650
Oh amazing.
I thought it was all white man.

933
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:38,090
Why does it have like a Rainbow Hue to 
it?

934
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,990
Is it the same photo?
Hmm.

935
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:43,843
That's weird.
I could've sworn I might be another 

936
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:46,280
person.
No,

937
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:47,910
it's the same guy.
It's definitely the same guy.

938
00:43:47,911 --> 00:43:50,290
And that's the same photo.
But the image looked yes.

939
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,920
And that image he,
it was,

940
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:52,843
it was white and some of images it was,
well I think somebody's added something 

941
00:43:55,971 --> 00:43:59,140
to that photo.
I think they put like the,

942
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,940
the sun rays and shit.
That's the one.

943
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:03,470
The one,
see the one above him with the suit.

944
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,140
Not that one right there.
That kept going to the second row.

945
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:06,861
Second row.
Yeah.

946
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:08,060
There you go.
Click on that one.

947
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,870
That was the image.
It was just him with a white background.

948
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,580
He said,
Yo,

949
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:14,800
I'm in heaven.
Dog.

950
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:20,720
Fucking know Jesus loves you.
I'm telling you man,

951
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,120
and he was selling these photos.
Slick suit though.

952
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,720
Suit.
What's that?

953
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,750
Ruffled shirt?
What does it say?

954
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,130
What he saw?
We'll burn your heart.

955
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,023
What?
Yeah.

956
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,550
I don't know if that would bring your 
heart.

957
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,020
I don't want my heartburn.
I think it's green.

958
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,873
Your heart is good the way it is.
Imagine if there was a heaven and we 

959
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:43,764
were just talking shit.
Imagine if like one day the space 

960
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:46,374
shuttle takes the wrong turn and it's on
its way up into orbit and it just pops 

961
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:52,020
through this little hole and like,
oh shit,

962
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,500
we're and have a Dan Heaven and they get
out,

963
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,810
take their head gear off.
They can breathe.

964
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:59,970
His angels hanging around up there.
It's like,

965
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,583
you know,
I think it's just people have made that 

966
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:04,164
wrong turn.
Like Jordan Peterson was saying of 

967
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:05,994
taking these things as literal when they
should be metaphysical like we all have 

968
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:12,060
the ability to create heaven and hell in
our own life,

969
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:12,894
which is a point when we made and then 
you know when we are pure consciousness 

970
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,130
what I've experienced at least from from
all the psychedelic experiences.

971
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:20,963
When you,
when the body disappears and becomes 

972
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,653
less prominent and you're thinking you 
are what seemingly just pure 

973
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:28,590
consciousness,
you know,

974
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:32,640
there's also that opportunity there for 
heaven to embrace all of the love.

975
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:34,980
And then there's also the opportunity to
look back on your life.

976
00:45:34,981 --> 00:45:36,780
Like,
what the fuck?

977
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,680
You know,
I really,

978
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,810
I made these choices that hurt these 
people and that is this almost hell,

979
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,500
you know,
so,

980
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,760
so Helen Heaven is again,
you know,

981
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,210
as above.
So below it's just a mental state,

982
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,920
you know?
And that could be the same,

983
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,960
very same mental state that we go 
across.

984
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:54,240
But instead we tried to make it 
concrete.

985
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:55,200
We tried to,
you know,

986
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,360
Salvador Bosh,
you know,

987
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,253
tried to create all of these horrible 
things of things biting you and burning 

988
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:02,274
you in vis,
rating your genitals and prying you 

989
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:04,524
apart when all of that is really a 
metaphor for what's happening in your 

990
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:08,160
mind,
you know,

991
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:09,450
not an actual place.

992
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,450
Yeah.
Like the mind of Dick Cheney.

993
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,430
Yeah.
I kinda his Dick Cheney,

994
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:16,870
go to sleep without pills.
You know,

995
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,713
what kind of,
what kind of dreams does that guy have 

996
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,670
right now?
Woo.

997
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,790
And what happens when he's liberated 
from,

998
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,130
you know,
from all of the rationalizations.

999
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:27,560
You know,
like when,

1000
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:29,400
when all of those things is to be like,
like,

1001
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:30,234
you know,
you get in the float tank and you see 

1002
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:32,004
all these things that have allowed you 
to think a certain way and then you go 

1003
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:37,890
floating and then all of those 
structures go apart and then you look at

1004
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:40,060
that thing you did and go,
ah,

1005
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,910
was that cool?
Was that Douchey?

1006
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,160
You know,
like you cause it,

1007
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:44,994
but he's never had that moment.
He's never stopped the hamster wheel 

1008
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:48,084
long enough to get still to be able to 
look at his life from his higher self 

1009
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:51,871
and be like,
Whoa,

1010
00:46:51,871 --> 00:46:52,620
what am I doing?

1011
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,950
Look at all this momentum.
Look at all the software viruses that my

1012
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:59,220
open open source consciousness has 
picked up along the way.

1013
00:46:59,221 --> 00:47:01,200
These different fears,
different greeds,

1014
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,230
these lust for power,
these different things that have created

1015
00:47:04,231 --> 00:47:05,064
this thing that's never stopped.
And the momentum's never gotten quiet 

1016
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:08,634
enough for them to really analyze it.
Do they kept that guy alive with 

1017
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:16,401
somebody else's heart date?
They cut him open and put another dude's

1018
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:17,334
heart inside of him.
That is fucking crazy to think that 

1019
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:24,210
human beings can do that.
We could fix,

1020
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,280
they can take out your lungs,
man.

1021
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:28,860
They can replace your lungs with someone
else's lungs.

1022
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,633
I think that's all helpful to thinking 
about it because the more we lose that 

1023
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:39,250
attachment to this body as being like 
anything but the machine,

1024
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:42,760
the machine that's going to allow us to 
experience consciousness in the physical

1025
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:44,860
form.
I think when we really look at that,

1026
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,400
then that's going to be a helpful kind 
of metaphysical underpinning.

1027
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:53,401
So we're not so caught up in these,
in these elements that are causing us so

1028
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:56,470
much discomfort and suffering.
Right.

1029
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:57,850
We're not trapped.
Yeah.

1030
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:01,480
And this idea of what we are.
Yeah,

1031
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,973
but like isn't it inevitable if they,
if they come up with bionic eyes to let 

1032
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:07,894
you stare at the sun,
you could watch netflix on them and 

1033
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:13,750
they're way better than regular eyes and
they give the people who lose their eyes

1034
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:14,584
first and then people start going to 
scoop these fucking Shitty bitches out 

1035
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:18,820
and give me some of them.
Good eyes.

1036
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,300
And you get them good eyes and he start,
I mean everybody has a good eyes.

1037
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:24,280
You just walk around and look at each 
other a wink,

1038
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,020
you know,
you know I got the good eyes.

1039
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:27,220
You've got to go.
You could see each other,

1040
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:30,160
can fucking read sports scores flying in
the sky.

1041
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:31,690
It's the hardware upgrade.
Yeah,

1042
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,730
upgrade.
Have binocular vision.

1043
00:48:33,731 --> 00:48:36,760
You can decide to zoom in on things far 
off into the distance.

1044
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,893
Why wouldn't you do that?
What do you like seeing at your shitty 

1045
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:43,150
old fucking bloodshot eyes?

1046
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:44,850
Yeah,
bitch ass eyes.

1047
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,340
The upgrade,
the hardware and then we just gotta make

1048
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:51,120
sure that we're upgrading the software 
and eliminating the viruses,

1049
00:48:51,121 --> 00:48:55,740
wanting those system checks to get all 
of these bad programs out of our head.

1050
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,740
Get the better metaphysical truth 
programs like,

1051
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,960
like the platinum rule,
like you know,

1052
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:01,823
you,
everybody is you living a different 

1053
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:04,860
life.
Treat him as such,

1054
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:05,963
you know,
like get some of these other software 

1055
00:49:07,441 --> 00:49:09,660
programs running.
Discard the old ones.

1056
00:49:09,661 --> 00:49:12,120
Then upgrade the hardware all you want 
and,

1057
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,040
but both have to kind of come in 
conjunction.

1058
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,100
Otherwise we'll do what we did with 
technology.

1059
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:17,934
Elevating faster than consciousness.
Technology elevates fast and the 

1060
00:49:20,101 --> 00:49:22,410
consciousness and we just fuck each 
other up better.

1061
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:23,970
Yeah,
we definitely do that.

1062
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:24,300
I think

1063
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:29,070
also technology is just,
it's just trying to get us more and more

1064
00:49:29,071 --> 00:49:31,740
addicted to it.
I was thinking of this the other day and

1065
00:49:31,741 --> 00:49:32,574
I was flying back from Hawaii.
I was thinking of how many people I see 

1066
00:49:35,611 --> 00:49:36,444
stare at a phone at the airport,
at the fucking mall and a restaurant 

1067
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,700
myself.
I'm staring at my own phone.

1068
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:45,470
Well,
I'm mean,

1069
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:46,303
I'm not immune to it.
We're all staring at fucking phones and 

1070
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:50,610
I'm like,
if I was a pilgrim,

1071
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,310
if you took took,
you went back in a time machine,

1072
00:49:53,311 --> 00:49:57,090
he grabbed a pilgrim and you dragged 
them to 2016 and you said,

1073
00:49:57,091 --> 00:49:58,680
what are you saying?
They'd be like,

1074
00:49:58,681 --> 00:50:00,660
my God,
they're all,

1075
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:02,670
they're all prisoners to the looking 
glass.

1076
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:05,850
He'd been captured like do were like,
it's like threaten their spouse.

1077
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,713
They're under her spell.
They stare at a fucking glass screen 

1078
00:50:09,061 --> 00:50:09,990
first thing in the morning.

1079
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,570
They check their email to go to work.
They stare at a screen.

1080
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,260
They look at their navigation system.
While they're fucking driving to work.

1081
00:50:16,261 --> 00:50:18,750
They get home.
They watched TV before they go to bed,

1082
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:22,230
they check their email again.
They're just staring at fucking screens.

1083
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,210
They're living their lives through 
screens.

1084
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,280
I would think to looking glass.
It's captivated though.

1085
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:31,070
I would think they were under the spell 
of glass.

1086
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,110
Like there was something about something
bond.

1087
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:33,973
They're not moving.
They're just sitting there in front of 

1088
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:39,170
this fucking thing all day.
They're almost does almost no movement.

1089
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,080
Almost all the time you're in front of a
screen.

1090
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,770
You're just sitting there.
Yeah.

1091
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,530
If you saw that and you had no idea what
the fuck had television was or a phone,

1092
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:51,230
you were just a person from another time
period and he said,

1093
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:52,064
what do you think's going on?

1094
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:53,960
Like with these fucking people are under
a spell.

1095
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:57,320
They're clearly under a spell.
Like it's giving them something.

1096
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:59,360
Yeah,
but that's what a spell is and mean.

1097
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,930
The fucking when the the the,
the hip dodick dancer dances in front of

1098
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:05,300
you and then all of a sudden you don't 
even know where you are anymore.

1099
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:06,830
It's cause you're looking at something 
cool.

1100
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,020
It's a strip club.
Yeah,

1101
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,300
exactly.
There you go.

1102
00:51:09,301 --> 00:51:10,370
Know where you are.
Yeah.

1103
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:12,110
You ate the edible did Joey Diaz gave 
you,

1104
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,410
that was mislabeled on purpose.
You,

1105
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,490
this is what you're seeing.
You're,

1106
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:21,500
you're seeing something amazing and that
amazing thing is making you want more of

1107
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:23,804
it so you're,
you're spending more money to get a 

1108
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:30,110
better computer to make better 
explosions on the bigger screen that has

1109
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:30,944
the better sound and it keeps going 
deeper and deeper and every fucking new 

1110
00:51:33,921 --> 00:51:38,240
phone has some new way to get chicks 
excited and you're staring at the newest

1111
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:41,540
and best screen and just locked into 
this,

1112
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,890
this sort of hypnotic trance of 
technology.

1113
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:46,903
Oh,
it allowable allows you to Bluetooth 

1114
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,063
with your navigation.
So stone syncs up to your car and like 

1115
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:54,290
you're still staring at a fucking screen
and not doing anything.

1116
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,340
It doesn't matter what's happening.
The same effect is taking place.

1117
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,140
You're staring at a screen.

1118
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,793
I think what's,
what's interesting to me is I think 

1119
00:52:03,511 --> 00:52:04,344
we're in this intermediary intermediary 
stage where we're watching this rapid 

1120
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,790
advancement and things are getting more 
and more interesting,

1121
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:12,863
but I think there's going to be a 
tipping point where technology is so 

1122
00:52:15,691 --> 00:52:18,360
ubiquitous that will actually,
it'll,

1123
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,253
it'll kind of settled into our lives in 
a better way and maybe some people will 

1124
00:52:21,901 --> 00:52:22,734
get completely lost,
but I think a lot of us are already 

1125
00:52:24,721 --> 00:52:28,620
reaching that point where it's almost 
too much and it's forcing us to make our

1126
00:52:28,621 --> 00:52:30,420
own boundaries,
put our phone down.

1127
00:52:30,421 --> 00:52:32,850
You know,
this idea of put your phone away on this

1128
00:52:32,851 --> 00:52:34,200
retreat.
There's no phones here.

1129
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,960
We're starting to develop the counter 
reaction to it,

1130
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:40,710
but it has to get to the point of 
ridiculous in order for us to do,

1131
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,690
you know,
have this kind of counter reaction.

1132
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,210
I think that's the way it's going.
I think that's like using them.

1133
00:52:45,211 --> 00:52:46,620
Fred flintstones breaks

1134
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,440
Formula One car.
Good luck.

1135
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:51,510
We're going to put our phone away for a 
whole hour.

1136
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,510
You know,
it's just sitting there and your bag.

1137
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:06,630
Only the only hope that I have for that 
philosophy.

1138
00:53:06,631 --> 00:53:07,464
How was espousing is I like I learned,
I thought it's something at burning man 

1139
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:15,350
and burning and burning man.
There was,

1140
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,793
it's so much shit like you have no idea.
You can't even fathom how many lit up 

1141
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:25,350
amazingly beautiful fire breathing,
art creations,

1142
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:26,430
dancing

1143
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,170
people,
half naked people,

1144
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:32,340
fully naked people or g tents.
This crazy amalgamation.

1145
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:33,174
I mean I was in this like thunder dome.
They rebuilt the thunderdome basically 

1146
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:37,943
and they had people on bungee cords and 
two topless chicks were smashing into 

1147
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:41,814
each other on bungee cords,
beating each other with foam sabres as 

1148
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:45,474
like house music played behind and a 
fucking fire breathing dragon car like 

1149
00:53:49,261 --> 00:53:53,340
rode by breathing fire.
Like that is ridiculous.

1150
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,470
Sounds awesome.
It's ridiculous.

1151
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,810
But what after you've been there for a 
while,

1152
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:58,853
like you realize the Times that you 
enjoy the most are getting high with 

1153
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:03,990
your homeys in the rv.
You know,

1154
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:04,824
like that's the absolute best time you 
have a burning man and those like just 

1155
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:11,760
laughing and hanging and drinking a beer
in the rv.

1156
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:15,470
Do you think that's enhanced though by 
the chaotic environment and the fact you

1157
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:16,860
have this crazy feeling like,
wow,

1158
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:18,540
we're here,
we're here.

1159
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,463
For sure.
That's kind of what goes on at a place 

1160
00:54:20,881 --> 00:54:21,481
like that,
right?

1161
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:22,111
It's like,
wow,

1162
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:23,000
we're here.
Yeah,

1163
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,780
yeah.
All of it contributes.

1164
00:54:24,781 --> 00:54:29,430
But then just realizing like we can do 
that rv moment anywhere.

1165
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,050
Like you don't need to be in burning 
man.

1166
00:54:31,051 --> 00:54:33,210
You don't.
That is the most special shit.

1167
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,400
Like the most special shit is the simple
shit.

1168
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:38,430
So you can take all this technology does
all this awesome stuff,

1169
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,383
but it's never going to be like that 
hike or that time you're hanging and 

1170
00:54:42,411 --> 00:54:45,600
playing with your kids or that time you 
went fishing or that time.

1171
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,500
It's never going to beat that.
You know?

1172
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,730
And you start to realize that when it 
gets to the ridiculous,

1173
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:54,180
it's just when it's on this kind of 
intermediary level that it's hard for us

1174
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:55,050
to figure out,
I think.

1175
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,153
Yeah.
Well I think the only way to truly 

1176
00:54:57,871 --> 00:54:59,850
appreciate the natural world,
excuse me,

1177
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,840
to truly appreciate the wonders of the 
natural world is to,

1178
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,760
to be engaged in it.

1179
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,713
Separate of the electronic world,
like if you're on some crazy hike but 

1180
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:13,680
you're also staring at your phone the 
entire time you're walking,

1181
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,530
you're just not going to get the whole 
feet.

1182
00:55:16,531 --> 00:55:17,364
Like if you,
if you're hiking in Yosemite and you 

1183
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:22,950
know some of those incredible views and 
vistas and you're traveling around these

1184
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:24,203
amazing nature,
just like you're not going to really 

1185
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:26,874
take that in.
If you're looking at your phone all the 

1186
00:55:28,171 --> 00:55:30,240
time or thinking about what picture 
you're going to take.

1187
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,140
Yeah,
yeah.

1188
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,020
You got a bunch of selfies because 
you're inherently,

1189
00:55:34,021 --> 00:55:34,854
there's nothing about the phone that is 
in the present moment unless something 

1190
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:38,850
is immediately popping up.
Right.

1191
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,820
It's all about the past.
How I look,

1192
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:42,960
you know,
if the future,

1193
00:55:42,961 --> 00:55:44,160
how,
what am I going to post?

1194
00:55:44,161 --> 00:55:44,994
What's going to come?
So it takes you out of the present 

1195
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,633
moment.
I think present moment is really the 

1196
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:53,380
only pleasurable state that we have on 
the planet is when your presence,

1197
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:58,381
those fucking screens,
man and your ego is just preen.

1198
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:03,540
Yeah.

1199
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,970
Look up like 5,000
likes,

1200
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,910
5,000
likes.

1201
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,000
Yeah.
You put filters on shit.

1202
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,500
Get that angle perfect.
God get those.

1203
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,920
It's so seductive though.
I mean,

1204
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,570
even before,
even before there was,

1205
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,100
you know,
these phones and selfies,

1206
00:56:20,101 --> 00:56:23,560
there was paintings and then there is 
just your appearance in general.

1207
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:25,780
So people would get seduced by the,
you know,

1208
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,640
their reflection in the mirror and 
looking pretty good,

1209
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,530
you know,
and then all the way back,

1210
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:30,364
maybe even before there was mirrors,
there was that time in the brook and 

1211
00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:34,380
that's where you get that,
uh,

1212
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:39,070
the myth of narcissus who just couldn't 
stop looking at his reflection in the,

1213
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,590
in the waters of the Stream,
you know?

1214
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:45,100
And that was like the original point of 
you start looking at yourself,

1215
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:47,590
not ad sells.
Separating yourself from self.

1216
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,040
You'll never be in the present moment.
You'll always be looking at yourself,

1217
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:51,880
judging yourself.

1218
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,070
And that's a game you can never fucking 
win.

1219
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,993
You're not gonna win that one bitch.
W W how much do you think it costs back 

1220
00:56:58,361 --> 00:56:59,194
in the day to get your portrait painted?
Like if you got your portrait painted 

1221
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:05,180
back in the Hellenic Saul's,
you are a bad motherfucker,

1222
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,000
right?
You had some cash,

1223
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:08,040
man,
you gotta,

1224
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:08,883
you sat there and looked regal with your
best clothes while some dude just 

1225
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,940
painted you for how long?
How long does it take?

1226
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:16,893
Well,
they would pose for marbled busts back 

1227
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:19,503
even before then.
Like you go back to the Roman and Greek 

1228
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,810
Times.
That's insane.

1229
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:28,060
That's insane how long that takes three 
to get carved in marble.

1230
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,230
Yeah,
that's insane.

1231
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,340
And you can't move.
But the ego is so seductive.

1232
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:34,300
You know,
you want that.

1233
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,553
You want to portray that image and it,
the problem is it's just always so 

1234
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:39,124
vulnerable.
Like it never feels confident no matter 

1235
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:42,760
how wealthy you are,
how good looking you are.

1236
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:46,690
It's always unshaking ground because 
it's all nonsense.

1237
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,070
You know,
your consciousness.

1238
00:57:48,071 --> 00:57:48,904
And that's enough.
Like you don't need to be all of these 

1239
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:52,570
things.
But you do though.

1240
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,320
If you're that guy,
he'd be that guy that sits there for the

1241
00:57:56,321 --> 00:57:57,640
bust.
I mean,

1242
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:58,474
that's one of the things I was thinking 
when I was in Rome and I was going 

1243
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:01,290
through the Vatican,
uh,

1244
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:02,163
we were looking at all these different 
sculptures of like that there's no way 

1245
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:06,820
everyone was jacked.
Like everyone was jacked.

1246
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,990
Everyone,
everyone.

1247
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:08,824
Everyone had a six pack.
It's so polite how they made everybody 

1248
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:15,160
with a small dicks and nobody felt like,
you know why they did that?

1249
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,960
So nobody felt like it was just,
no,

1250
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:17,321
no,
no,

1251
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:18,640
no.
It's interestingly enough,

1252
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,550
I asked of course,
and uh,

1253
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:25,960
the,
the guy told me that in the Roman age it

1254
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:27,670
was considered a barbaric.

1255
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,713
If you had a big penis like you,
you weren't a person of culture or 

1256
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:35,230
thought if you had a big penis.
And whether he's correct or not,

1257
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:38,110
I'm not sure Jamie looked that up.
Please.

1258
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,010
But that's interesting that like these 
little Dick dudes and say,

1259
00:58:42,011 --> 00:58:43,540
listen,
this big Dick thing,

1260
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,450
it's a fad.
Okay.

1261
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:49,270
Don't get attached to it.
There were all brutes and assholes.

1262
00:58:49,271 --> 00:58:50,950
That's why we're in this mess in the 
first place.

1263
00:58:50,951 --> 00:58:54,610
It's all those big Dick assholes.
You want a solid,

1264
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:59,920
a solid Roman Catholic government.
You needed a little dick dude with a six

1265
00:58:59,921 --> 00:59:01,480
pack,
just jacked.

1266
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,270
The tits looks like GSP with a leaf over
his death.

1267
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:08,830
The leaves were a lot of leads or put 
over the Dick's later.

1268
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,650
And a lot of the leaves,
uh,

1269
00:59:10,651 --> 00:59:11,484
the,
that like style of the leaf over the 

1270
00:59:12,671 --> 00:59:14,240
deck posts,
Constantine.

1271
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,143
Yeah.
It happened later after some religious 

1272
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:17,854
period,
they just decided to stop looking at 

1273
00:59:18,701 --> 00:59:19,451
Dick's.
They just like,

1274
00:59:19,451 --> 00:59:20,284
what?
This has been in front of us the whole 

1275
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:22,430
time.
Oh my goodness.

1276
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,181
That's,
I mean,

1277
00:59:23,181 --> 00:59:23,970
it's,
it's really,

1278
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:24,803
uh,
like that classic example of let's make 

1279
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:28,240
something that we're not,
yeah,

1280
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:30,240
let's make that bad.
You know,

1281
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,540
that thing is bad.
So we don't have a big Dick.

1282
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,793
But I mean,
I think there were also the honest 

1283
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:39,940
inclination that guy's got a hog and a 
half though the devil.

1284
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,450
He's the devil.
Yeah.

1285
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:45,800
The demons always had giant dicks.
You don't want that girl,

1286
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,310
that big Dick Demon Monster.
Um,

1287
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,190
yeah.
That guy's got a hog.

1288
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:54,800
Put it away,
Jamie.

1289
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,990
Kind of looking at it.
It's,

1290
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:57,750
um,
it's,

1291
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:58,583
it's,
it's just weird to think that they were 

1292
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:04,730
struggling between like,
I guess a big Dick represented virility,

1293
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:07,550
which represented conquest,
which represented war,

1294
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:08,563
which represents a strife,
like all those big Dick dudes just 

1295
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,150
coming over the mountains.
Fucking big shaggy beards,

1296
01:00:14,151 --> 01:00:15,940
swinging swords and shit.
Brennan.

1297
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,813
The Gall,
we gotta stop this fighting himself and 

1298
01:00:18,621 --> 01:00:19,454
yelling and his bear skins on mushrooms 
as he's looking at a line of 

1299
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:23,740
impenetrable shield.

1300
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,860
That guy,
that guy.

1301
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:25,431
Yeah.
Yeah.

1302
01:00:25,431 --> 01:00:29,300
You don't want that guy and his giant 
Dick that thought we had a hawk or sure.

1303
01:00:29,301 --> 01:00:34,301
Just hair braided around like says Les 
Pauls.

1304
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,043
Yeah.
I mean if a girl tried to suck his dick 

1305
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:40,280
literally sucking on one of those cat 
posts,

1306
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:45,050
it's just say Harry Dick Harry.
Like,

1307
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,870
look what you imagine a Buffalo Dick 
would be like,

1308
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:48,733
oh,
he's just random hairs hanging off of 

1309
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:55,700
the shaft of his Dick.
Just dreadlock barbarian Dick.

1310
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:01,260
He probably comes up a bright white,
bright white light toothpaste.

1311
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:06,420
Just raw is the moonlight and glow boom.
Shoots out.

1312
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,980
Looks like bones,
like liquid bones from out of his dick.

1313
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,053
You could,
you can't have that guy around his milk 

1314
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:20,503
deck.
You need a little dudes with six packs 

1315
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:24,170
that look like they could go gay at any 
moment in time.

1316
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:25,580
Cause they did.
Yeah.

1317
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,423
Every one of them was just ready to suck
a cock and conveniently the dicks were 

1318
01:01:28,941 --> 01:01:29,774
small,
so nobody gagged if that's what was 

1319
01:01:31,161 --> 01:01:31,640
going on too.

1320
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,830
There was a lot of Dick Sucking back 
then the guys who made,

1321
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:35,800
it's just a friendly little dick.
You know,

1322
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:36,643
they didn't have those barbarian dicks 
deal with wonder when they realize you 

1323
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:41,830
shouldn't fuck dudes all the time when 
when they realized when they were,

1324
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,860
when he,
she's like,

1325
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,620
because people who essentially weren't 
even gay,

1326
01:01:45,621 --> 01:01:46,454
we're fucking dude's right.
Not there's anything wrong with being 

1327
01:01:48,051 --> 01:01:49,640
gay.
Let's just get that out of the way.

1328
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,160
I'm not judging in any way 
homosexuality,

1329
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:54,560
but I'm saying that it's,
it's uh,

1330
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:59,960
less likely than being straight.
But back then that was on the case.

1331
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,540
Yeah.
Whether you were an actual gay person or

1332
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:03,830
not,
that's the question.

1333
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:04,933
Were they gay people?
There are more gay people where they're 

1334
01:02:06,471 --> 01:02:09,080
more bisexual people or was everybody 
greedy?

1335
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,110
I think it's,
I think it's a combination.

1336
01:02:12,111 --> 01:02:16,400
I think we're naturally a lot more 
bisexual then we act on because we're,

1337
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:19,040
everybody's also naturally quite a bit

1338
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,450
and that's,
that's part of it.

1339
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:23,880
But I also think they were fucking kids 
back then.

1340
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:26,640
And it was like there was like the 
momentum of fucking kids.

1341
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:28,890
Like if you're a kid and you get fucked 
by a dude,

1342
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:32,940
like I think there's gotta be a 
correlation there between,

1343
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,160
you know,
having the desire to do the same thing.

1344
01:02:35,161 --> 01:02:37,620
It's just like if your dad beats you,
then you want to,

1345
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,180
you know,
beat when you're a dad.

1346
01:02:39,181 --> 01:02:41,340
It's this the same kind of an ingrained 
thing.

1347
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:44,640
And I think they just got this momentum 
of kid fucking,

1348
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:49,500
and then that probably contributed along
with there's the open mindedness and not

1349
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:50,760
being homophobic.
Actually they,

1350
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,210
they sometimes are homophobic against 
the people who would receive the Dick,

1351
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,250
but the people who were supplying the 
Dick,

1352
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,740
it was like prison.
It's kind of like prison basically.

1353
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,920
Like the whole society was prison,
you know,

1354
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:04,320
cause if you're,
if you're the pitcher you're not really,

1355
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:05,580
you know,
it's Kinda normal.

1356
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:06,520
Everybody's a picture.
Yeah.

1357
01:03:06,521 --> 01:03:07,970
You just show the character of the 
loads,

1358
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:08,440
you know?
And,

1359
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,520
and that was like one thing,
if you look at some of the graffiti when

1360
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:12,354
Cesar was taking over power,
like some of the group for graffiti was 

1361
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:18,480
calling him like the catcher.
Oh like Cesar,

1362
01:03:18,481 --> 01:03:19,650
you catch her,
you know,

1363
01:03:19,651 --> 01:03:22,050
whatever,
whatever word that was for that,

1364
01:03:22,051 --> 01:03:22,884
you know,
cause that was still a slight like you 

1365
01:03:24,451 --> 01:03:28,530
were supposed to at at the most virile.
If you're head of the Roman legions,

1366
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:30,120
you know,
you want to be the pitcher.

1367
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,433
When I was in high school and my friend 
Jimmy lawless I'm still friends with 

1368
01:03:33,301 --> 01:03:34,410
today,
I love that dude.

1369
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,380
But Jimmy Wallace was,
what a great name by the way.

1370
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:39,900
It's right up there with Eddie Bravo.
But he,

1371
01:03:39,901 --> 01:03:42,440
uh,
w we knew this dude who was bisexual and

1372
01:03:42,441 --> 01:03:43,620
we were kind of weirded out because we 
were,

1373
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:45,980
you know,
I think I was 17 and Jimmy was 18.

1374
01:03:45,981 --> 01:03:47,010
And you're like,
what the fuck?

1375
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:48,690
Like what do you think?
What does that mean?

1376
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:49,524
Like,
uh,

1377
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,700
cause he,
you know,

1378
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,360
he goes,
I don't know if I believe in bisexuals.

1379
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,660
I think they're just greedy.

1380
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,720
He started laughing.
He started laughing so hard cause he was

1381
01:04:00,721 --> 01:04:04,440
only like half serious but cause I think
they're just greedy.

1382
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,713
I'll never forget it.
It's like so burned in my head as a 17 

1383
01:04:10,141 --> 01:04:11,850
year old that laughed at everything.
You know,

1384
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:14,610
I had a 17 year olds,
ridiculously stupid sense of humor.

1385
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:17,690
And to this day if someone says 
bisexual,

1386
01:04:17,691 --> 01:04:21,740
I just think of him going,
well is this,

1387
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:24,090
I mean humans have put their Dick and 
everything.

1388
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:25,410
Anything,
anything,

1389
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:28,030
whatever.
Who's these couches for?

1390
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:29,760
Cheap flashlights,
people,

1391
01:04:29,761 --> 01:04:30,571
men,
women,

1392
01:04:30,571 --> 01:04:31,620
whatever.
How we met.

1393
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:34,480
Yeah.
Well I think we should clarify.

1394
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,800
Aubrey and I met when he worked for the 
flush,

1395
01:04:37,801 --> 01:04:38,634
right.
If you didn't know that I'll be working 

1396
01:04:39,841 --> 01:04:41,970
for a company that,
a fake vagina.

1397
01:04:41,971 --> 01:04:44,910
You have sexual gelatinous fake.
It was like man,

1398
01:04:44,911 --> 01:04:46,230
if something form with gelatin or 
something,

1399
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:47,671
food,
chores.

1400
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:50,670
Gelatin can't divulge family secrets.

1401
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,580
But uh,
um,

1402
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:53,970
it's a,
that's how we met Pete.

1403
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,940
People love to just get rid of com and 
makes you feel better.

1404
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:00,660
And I think we got to just remove all of
the fucking stigma about it.

1405
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:01,920
Like,
I know it's just,

1406
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:02,843
it's the come release mechanism for the 
pleasure monkey and that was actually 

1407
01:05:05,731 --> 01:05:06,564
like that.
That word was something that came to me 

1408
01:05:07,801 --> 01:05:10,080
actually my Wasco trip.
But that's what we fucking are.

1409
01:05:10,081 --> 01:05:10,914
Where pleasure monkeys.
Like we're here to soak in as much 

1410
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:15,180
pleasure,
laughter,

1411
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,100
feel all the things that you can fucking
feel to your

1412
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,140
body.
Hit all of the pleasure buttons.

1413
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,540
Like why would you have a pleasure 
button and not push it?

1414
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:26,380
It doesn't make any sense.
Like push all of your pleasure buttons.

1415
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,214
Let's feel what that feels like.
Let's go through and finish this 

1416
01:05:29,771 --> 01:05:32,680
existence in the material form saying 
like,

1417
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,000
man,
there was like,

1418
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:35,320
you don't want to have that button.
You're like,

1419
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:36,460
man,
I heard that button was awesome,

1420
01:05:36,461 --> 01:05:37,294
but I just never pushed it because I was
afraid and it was a religion said this 

1421
01:05:39,221 --> 01:05:40,054
thing and blah blah blah,
like fucking pushed the pleasure 

1422
01:05:41,831 --> 01:05:43,270
buttons.
Like let's look shit.

1423
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:44,480
Yeah,
you know,

1424
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,360
recognize that that's what we're here 
for.

1425
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:48,490
And stop.
Stop stressing so much about it.

1426
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,340
Like the idea that you should be guilty 
for your pleasure.

1427
01:05:51,341 --> 01:05:53,920
Like you don't deserve it.
Like you do.

1428
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:54,813
We still have the echoes of the puritans
that landed here and sort of tried to 

1429
01:05:57,611 --> 01:05:58,660
reestablish

1430
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:03,960
mean w w what's really similar to a lot 
of other crazy religious ideologies,

1431
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:04,794
views on sex,
like really rigid restrictive sex 

1432
01:06:06,691 --> 01:06:08,400
practices,
you know,

1433
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:12,540
and that stuff's stuck.
It's hard to shake that shit off.

1434
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:15,210
It's hard to be grown adults like you 
are with your friends,

1435
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:16,860
you know,
like you are with your friends,

1436
01:06:16,861 --> 01:06:18,660
you talk about sex,
you know,

1437
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:20,340
it's just sex.
It's,

1438
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:22,130
it's what people do.
It feels,

1439
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:23,250
you don't say,
oh,

1440
01:06:23,251 --> 01:06:24,930
she wants sex,
that dirty,

1441
01:06:24,931 --> 01:06:28,380
dirty demon possessed woman going to go,
yeah,

1442
01:06:28,381 --> 01:06:29,150
look at her.
She's hot,

1443
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:31,170
but she wants to Dick all day.
Hot Girls.

1444
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:33,750
Like that's probably like what's going 
on when you look at Jennifer Lopez,

1445
01:06:33,751 --> 01:06:35,130
his ass,
like that's,

1446
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,890
that's the ass of a woman that probably 
enjoys a dick.

1447
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,480
Right.
You'd hope so dude up.

1448
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:42,810
So it seems like there's some system 
there,

1449
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,730
right?
It attracts them.

1450
01:06:44,731 --> 01:06:45,690
She probably likes them.

1451
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:49,470
It's like a flower and the,
the bees land on it and the flower wants

1452
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,740
to be.
Exactly.

1453
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:53,280
It's mutually the more fragrant the 
flower,

1454
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:56,700
the more it just desiring mutually 
beneficial relationship.

1455
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:57,653
But somewhere along the line people 
decided to restrict it and they've 

1456
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:00,423
really clamped down.
I and I think it was during the hard 

1457
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:02,784
times and I think it's just so much,
there's so much to the restriction on 

1458
01:07:07,801 --> 01:07:08,634
sex that I think also has to do with our
worrying about people not being able to 

1459
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:13,374
handle hard times if they come again,
like there's a lot of people I think in 

1460
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:16,764
this world with the preppers,
whether people that are just concerned 

1461
01:07:18,631 --> 01:07:19,464
about the future of the world,
they're really worried that people are 

1462
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:23,603
losing could.
And ironically it's funny because the 

1463
01:07:25,081 --> 01:07:25,914
people that would be more restrictive 
when it comes to sex and usually the 

1464
01:07:27,781 --> 01:07:28,614
right wingers,
but the right wingers are least 

1465
01:07:30,151 --> 01:07:31,980
concerned about environmental damage.

1466
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:36,810
They're more concerned about fiscal 
profits like currently and then the left

1467
01:07:36,811 --> 01:07:37,644
wing would be much more concerned with 
environmental but much less restrictive 

1468
01:07:42,811 --> 01:07:45,190
when it comes to sexuality.
Like the,

1469
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:46,403
the idea that you could just run around 
having sex with whoever you want and 

1470
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:53,100
just experiencing pleasure and not 
committing to people.

1471
01:07:53,101 --> 01:07:53,934
And having a good time and smoking a 
little pot and drinking and dancing and 

1472
01:07:57,001 --> 01:08:00,000
just enjoying life.
That's not good for commerce,

1473
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,400
right?
That's not good for business.

1474
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,240
That's not good.
And so if you want people to embrace the

1475
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:08,910
same sort of level of materialism that 
you're going to need to make your bottom

1476
01:08:08,911 --> 01:08:11,850
line go up every year,
you've got to stop these fucking hippies

1477
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:14,700
and their goddamn fucking dance out in 
the desert.

1478
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,030
Sure.
So he

1479
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,520
burning down the bullshit out there,
cutting back on our profits.

1480
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:20,653
You got to look at that motivation.
And you've also got to look at the 

1481
01:08:22,071 --> 01:08:24,590
motivation of,
of just control.

1482
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,733
You know,
like you take something that someone is 

1483
01:08:27,201 --> 01:08:30,050
going to think about all the fucking 
time,

1484
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,033
all the time,
and then make him guilty for that and 

1485
01:08:32,631 --> 01:08:36,980
make it as sin and make you the one who 
can absolve them of that sin.

1486
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:42,130
You got him fucking locked like every 
single human on planet earth is going to

1487
01:08:42,621 --> 01:08:45,170
sin and they're going to need you to 
rescue them from hell.

1488
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:46,220
Fire.
Boom.

1489
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:50,360
It's like the ultimate fucking rear 
naked choke on the human psyche,

1490
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:51,343
right?
Because no one's going to be able to 

1491
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:55,550
stop themselves from having sexual urges
and thoughts.

1492
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:58,610
And if your thoughts are a sin and 
you're the only one who can take it away

1493
01:08:58,611 --> 01:09:01,670
from its fucking the world's greatest 
con,

1494
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:05,690
the world's greatest con might be making
prostitution illegal,

1495
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:06,890
right?

1496
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:09,800
Like how do they figure out a way you 
can fuck anybody you want for free?

1497
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,810
Like there's,
it's not like it's illegal to fuck.

1498
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:13,220
It's not like murder,
you know,

1499
01:09:13,221 --> 01:09:14,600
like you just can't go around killing 
people.

1500
01:09:14,601 --> 01:09:17,090
I don't care how much you pay,
you can't go kill people.

1501
01:09:17,091 --> 01:09:18,500
That's not what we do.
Okay,

1502
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:22,460
we're civilized.
But you could just go get some coke,

1503
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,280
go to a bar,
started doing shots of people.

1504
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:26,420
Next thing you know,
you're banging people.

1505
01:09:26,421 --> 01:09:27,740
You put beverly,
even know them,

1506
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:30,440
right?
If you're some fucking wild person,

1507
01:09:30,441 --> 01:09:31,670
you could just,
if you're a girl,

1508
01:09:31,671 --> 01:09:32,504
especially God damn,
you could travel from place to place to 

1509
01:09:34,701 --> 01:09:38,420
place and give it away and just get dick
every anywhere you want.

1510
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,150
Right?
Well that is okay.

1511
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,660
But if you go there and you actually 
exchange pieces of paper or coins,

1512
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:47,270
that's not good,
or bitcoins,

1513
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:49,580
what the fuck?

1514
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,950
Like how is that possible?
Pick coin prostitute.

1515
01:09:51,951 --> 01:09:54,770
That's high level.
I'm more interested at high level.

1516
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:55,653
If I can pay for very high level and pay
for my sex act with a bitcoin really 

1517
01:09:58,521 --> 01:09:59,900
smart girl too,
they show up.

1518
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:00,983
They just see things differently.
I just think this is saying that you 

1519
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:09,110
could pay people for massages,
you could pay people to do your nails,

1520
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:10,003
you can get pedicures and manicures and 
you could have people do all sorts of 

1521
01:10:13,191 --> 01:10:14,024
stuff.
Do you wax you and just don't massage 

1522
01:10:15,931 --> 01:10:17,490
your Dick?
It's,

1523
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:19,370
it's crazy and I,
you know,

1524
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:20,863
honestly I think it's,
it's this special distinction that that 

1525
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:26,570
religion has given him the other,
some consequences of sex.

1526
01:10:26,571 --> 01:10:30,050
There's potential pregnancy,
but we've mostly eradicated that.

1527
01:10:30,051 --> 01:10:32,000
If you're really trying,
at least if you're trying,

1528
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:33,960
you can eradicate that,
that issue in there.

1529
01:10:33,961 --> 01:10:35,270
Some,
there's some diseases,

1530
01:10:35,271 --> 01:10:36,380
so there's some consequences.

1531
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:36,951
I get it.
I get,

1532
01:10:36,951 --> 01:10:39,830
it's a little different than a massage 
where you're less likely to get,

1533
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,930
you know anything of where it's a 
condom.

1534
01:10:41,931 --> 01:10:44,620
You filthy animal,
it's almost zero disease problems,

1535
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:45,463
but the amount of,
the amount of difference that people 

1536
01:10:47,001 --> 01:10:47,834
give that to like,
like you imagine your girl getting 

1537
01:10:49,461 --> 01:10:50,750
massage from a dude.
You're like,

1538
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:52,880
okay,
but then he massages her vagina.

1539
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:55,380
Oh man,
the stomach,

1540
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:56,263
the stomach feel funny and you want to 
Puke and you want to fight them and you 

1541
01:10:58,881 --> 01:10:59,714
want to stab him in the throat for 
touching your girl and you just think 

1542
01:11:04,611 --> 01:11:05,444
how wet she probably was.
She couldn't believe how naughty this 

1543
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:08,174
was.
She's probably leaking down the side of 

1544
01:11:09,591 --> 01:11:11,330
her legs.
Oh my gosh.

1545
01:11:11,331 --> 01:11:13,980
By came immediately.
As soon as he,

1546
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,360
his thumb just gently rubbed up against 
her assholes.

1547
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:21,360
Jill toes spread out under feet,
cramped up,

1548
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:26,640
Jesus and everybody felt so naughty,
naughty,

1549
01:11:26,641 --> 01:11:27,840
naughty,
naughty,

1550
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:29,363
terrible person,
terrible rule breaker violator later of 

1551
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:34,554
the trust.

1552
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:36,560
It's so crazy,
man.

1553
01:11:36,561 --> 01:11:38,600
We just got it all.
We just got it all,

1554
01:11:38,601 --> 01:11:41,750
look at each other and be like,
we're all just fucking pleasure monkeys.

1555
01:11:41,751 --> 01:11:44,360
It's cool where you get your pleasure.
I'm not your pleasure dealer.

1556
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,610
You know,
let's love each other and just

1557
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,960
be cool.
Yeah,

1558
01:11:47,961 --> 01:11:48,794
it's going to take a little while.
They can't close to that in the 60s for 

1559
01:11:51,411 --> 01:11:52,610
awhile.
You know what I mean?

1560
01:11:52,611 --> 01:11:53,444
You think about the difference between 
the fifties in the 60s I think about 

1561
01:11:55,491 --> 01:11:56,324
like the people in the 50s were all like
locked down watching Hawaii five o and 

1562
01:11:59,391 --> 01:12:00,224
shit.
Well actually that was probably the 60s 

1563
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,690
dragnet.
That's what I was trying to think of.

1564
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,800
Did you ever see the dragnet thing drag 
net Guy Joe Friday?

1565
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:10,790
It was talking to some fucking Hippie,
some God damn hippie and he's explaining

1566
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:13,760
to the Hippie uh,
how easy they have it and how,

1567
01:12:13,761 --> 01:12:18,020
how lucky they should they feel living 
in America today.

1568
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:18,883
What all the people that have sacrificed
so much to allow them to dress like 

1569
01:12:21,471 --> 01:12:22,304
silly people.
And it's so hilarious cause it sounds 

1570
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:27,610
like a person to this.
Is it like listen to this is fat and I'm

1571
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:30,800
selfish and you the first generation to 
come along with felt dissatisfied.

1572
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:33,560
They all have,
you know about different things.

1573
01:12:33,561 --> 01:12:36,200
And most of them didn't have the same 
opportunity in the freedoms that you do.

1574
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:38,960
Let's talk poverty.
Most places in the world,

1575
01:12:38,961 --> 01:12:41,390
that's not a problem.
It's a way of life and rights.

1576
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:42,563
They're to give you a blank stare 
because they may not know what you're 

1577
01:12:44,001 --> 01:12:44,834
talking about.
The fact is more people are living 

1578
01:12:46,731 --> 01:12:50,360
better right here than anywhere else 
ever before in history is I don't expect

1579
01:12:50,361 --> 01:12:52,760
us to roll over and play dead.
When you say you're dissatisfied,

1580
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:53,893
it's not perfect,
but it's a great deal better than when 

1581
01:12:54,801 --> 01:12:57,250
we grew up a hundred men standing on the
stoop,

1582
01:12:58,210 --> 01:12:59,043
Peckham,
Joe Friday's in a purple fucking 

1583
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:02,824
strictly and tars talking down to look 
like they're the dudes in the back of 

1584
01:13:08,421 --> 01:13:10,710
the Jimi Hendrix pan that nobody can 
tell you their name.

1585
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,250
I mean there's like Jimi Hendrix and the
dudes he was with and I'm sure if you're

1586
01:13:16,251 --> 01:13:19,070
fucking heavy duty music had,
you're mad at me right now.

1587
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:20,660
I understand,
but no,

1588
01:13:20,661 --> 01:13:24,860
this giant Jimi Hendrix Fan,
obviously giant.

1589
01:13:24,861 --> 01:13:26,810
I don't know who the fuck he toured 
with.

1590
01:13:26,811 --> 01:13:29,150
I don't know who those dudes were.
I have no idea.

1591
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,073
People when they see other people having
fun and they don't feel like they can 

1592
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:34,640
get there,
they want to shit on it.

1593
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:35,750
Yeah.
That's like,

1594
01:13:35,751 --> 01:13:39,320
that's like these got looking at having 
all this sex get an eye,

1595
01:13:39,321 --> 01:13:41,450
they look happy as shit.
Like that's going to,

1596
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:42,284
cause it's that resistance towards 
towards joining it that if the actually 

1597
01:13:45,651 --> 01:13:47,600
just relaxed and,
and did it,

1598
01:13:47,601 --> 01:13:48,434
they'd probably feel good but they can't
somehow they feel like they can or they 

1599
01:13:50,271 --> 01:13:51,104
shouldn't and they won't.
So the reaction is to remove that thing 

1600
01:13:53,181 --> 01:13:56,900
to squash that thing to make it more 
like them so that it feels so they don't

1601
01:13:56,901 --> 01:13:58,160
have that,
you know,

1602
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:59,880
those eyes that are looking over there 
saying,

1603
01:13:59,881 --> 01:14:00,714
oh,
maybe that life's better and what's 

1604
01:14:01,191 --> 01:14:02,750
wrong with me?
How come I can't do that?

1605
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,850
You know,
so people shit on it.

1606
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:07,120
I think the lines are being blurred 
though between like uh,

1607
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:12,260
really like hardcore no nonsense people 
like a Joe Friday type character and the

1608
01:14:14,471 --> 01:14:16,530
hippies,
those lines are getting like,

1609
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:19,360
there's a lot of people that like go in 
weird slots.

1610
01:14:19,361 --> 01:14:20,740
Like how'd that guy get in that?
Oh,

1611
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:23,320
he's in a weird spot.
Like he's kind of both of those things.

1612
01:14:23,321 --> 01:14:26,530
There's a lot of those people now that 
you can't really lock them down.

1613
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:27,364
He can't say this is a right wing person
or a left wing person is a no nonsense 

1614
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,470
discipline.
Get to work person.

1615
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:33,363
And this is a pothead and this is a guy 
likes to do mushrooms and this is a guy 

1616
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:38,800
who gets up in the morning and runs.
They might be the same dude now.

1617
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:39,753
Like there's a lot of like crossover 
between people who are like very 

1618
01:14:43,151 --> 01:14:43,984
disciplined hard workers but also 
experience pleasure and also understand 

1619
01:14:46,991 --> 01:14:47,824
that this is,
we are a temporary life form hurling 

1620
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:51,880
through infinity.

1621
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:56,620
Wake the fuck up and just have fun and 
enjoy this because this is madness.

1622
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,950
And it could very well be over at the 
blink of an eye,

1623
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,083
a fucking giant rock.
The size of Pittsburgh can come flying 

1624
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:04,954
out of the north and no one catches it 
until it's too late and it slams into 

1625
01:15:08,531 --> 01:15:11,770
the fucking polar ice cap.
And we're diggity diggity done.

1626
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:13,720
We're done.
That's it.

1627
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,700
It's a wrap.
There's like 50 of us left.

1628
01:15:15,701 --> 01:15:17,200
We eat each other,
you know,

1629
01:15:17,201 --> 01:15:19,180
we turned into mice.
The only thing,

1630
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:21,813
the only thing that we're,
that's keeping us from engaging in all 

1631
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:25,984
of these other forms that we went to is 
this clinging to identity and these and 

1632
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,070
these fear programs.
We like,

1633
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:33,820
we ditch all that then then you just get
wide open for everything else.

1634
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:37,060
And it's not a new idea like the idea of
the warrior poet,

1635
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:37,923
the idea back then if someone who could 
go to battle and like Musashi who could 

1636
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,003
be the best swordsman and also be the 
best calligrapher and also a writer and 

1637
01:15:44,681 --> 01:15:46,630
also meditate and also,
you know,

1638
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:50,230
have affairs and also do whatever like 
passionate love affair,

1639
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:53,530
all of the things like at a certain 
point people realize like,

1640
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,060
oh yeah,
all the things is best.

1641
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:57,670
And then at a certain point now in our 
culture,

1642
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:58,683
or at least getting to here,
it was like you have to identify with 

1643
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:04,900
this one thing and that's your thing.
And then you defend that thing and,

1644
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:06,140
and Nah,
man,

1645
01:16:06,141 --> 01:16:08,110
chuck and enjoy all of it.
Well,

1646
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:11,650
what I realized from Musashi when I was,
um,

1647
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:16,740
I think I was in my teens when I read 
the book of five rings the first time,

1648
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:20,680
what I realized is that he was 
explaining this concept that was totally

1649
01:16:20,681 --> 01:16:23,650
alien to me at the time as like an 
insecure teenager.

1650
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:29,220
He was explaining this concept of to be 
balanced at anything,

1651
01:16:29,561 --> 01:16:31,690
to be like at your best,
at anything,

1652
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,830
you have to have no loose ends.
You have to be loving,

1653
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:38,330
you have to be kind,
you have to be an artist,

1654
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,193
you have to be creative.
But you also have to be ruthless with 

1655
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:43,234
your sword technique.
And you have to be ruthless with your 

1656
01:16:45,221 --> 01:16:48,070
psychology and how you engage with your 
enemy and you,

1657
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:49,720
I mean,
he was a fascinating,

1658
01:16:49,721 --> 01:16:50,554
fascinating guy.
He got bored fighting people with 

1659
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:53,550
swords.
So he stopped,

1660
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,730
he started using oars from boats.
You start fucking people up with oars.

1661
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,833
He's like,
I'm just tired of fucking these bitches 

1662
01:16:59,951 --> 01:17:00,784
up with swords.
He killed 62 people and one on one 

1663
01:17:03,221 --> 01:17:06,370
combat with weapons.
Wow.

1664
01:17:06,490 --> 01:17:10,160
And along the way he developed this 
really

1665
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:10,993
intense,
very rigid sort of guideline for 

1666
01:17:15,141 --> 01:17:19,520
maintaining the ultimate warrior spirit.
And that was a balanced perspective.

1667
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:20,354
It was really weird because I remember 
reading about that at the time and I 

1668
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:26,540
thought he just had to be a killer man.
I thought you had to be,

1669
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:29,240
you know,
you had to be like Roberto Duran when he

1670
01:17:29,241 --> 01:17:31,010
was young.
You had to be just a savage.

1671
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:32,570
Like that was the only way to be a good 
fighter.

1672
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:35,660
He had to be a savage.
It'd be just someone who just came in,

1673
01:17:35,661 --> 01:17:37,400
just guns blazing,
didn't give a fuck.

1674
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:38,960
Like Mike Tyson,
the early days,

1675
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:41,000
there was the only way to be successful.
That's what I thought.

1676
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:42,760
And what he was saying is,
no,

1677
01:17:42,761 --> 01:17:44,790
you have to be a master of yourself.
Yup.

1678
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:49,340
The master of all aspects of yourself.
And there's no,

1679
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:50,203
there's no more terrifying form of 
combat than one on one with a fucking 

1680
01:17:52,611 --> 01:17:53,780
sword.
I mean,

1681
01:17:53,781 --> 01:17:54,614
he was the master.
He was the guy that figured it out in a 

1682
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:57,523
very strange time in Japanese history 
where he was a Ronin just traveling 

1683
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:03,320
around fucking killing people.
Yeah.

1684
01:18:03,321 --> 01:18:04,154
I think,

1685
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,013
I think some of these times when you 
look back some of the philosophies that 

1686
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:10,970
developed her or even more advanced than
ours,

1687
01:18:10,971 --> 01:18:13,520
because when you have a strong external 
pressure,

1688
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:17,030
like the,
like the likelihood of a sword battle to

1689
01:18:17,031 --> 01:18:17,910
the death.
Yeah.

1690
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:18,763
That forms this point of resistance 
where you got to cut out a lot of the 

1691
01:18:20,991 --> 01:18:22,160
bullshit,
all the bullshit.

1692
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:25,700
Like you really have to look at the 
world in a different way.

1693
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:30,680
And even when there was the threat of,
of fighting somebody at any point,

1694
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,170
you know,
that changes how you are as a man,

1695
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,213
like that chain.
That's an external point of resistance 

1696
01:18:35,901 --> 01:18:38,750
that causes you to understand certain 
things about,

1697
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,240
about the nature of life and the nature 
of your manhood.

1698
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:42,074
Whereas now we have so little external 
pressure like most of us can go through 

1699
01:18:46,341 --> 01:18:47,840
life and never get in a fight.

1700
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:48,973
You know,
that's not something that it's in a lot 

1701
01:18:49,701 --> 01:18:51,590
of people's lives still in some people's
lives.

1702
01:18:51,591 --> 01:18:52,424
For sure,
but like you're removed from these 

1703
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:57,470
different things and,
and sports offer that and kind of a very

1704
01:18:57,471 --> 01:18:58,304
controlled way,
but you take away all of these external 

1705
01:19:00,831 --> 01:19:01,664
pressures and then you get read.
It gets really squirly because you have 

1706
01:19:04,521 --> 01:19:07,370
nothing to define yourself against.
You don't have any resistance.

1707
01:19:07,371 --> 01:19:10,580
You're like lifting weights on the moon 
and no matter what you try to do,

1708
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,430
you can't get a fucking squat right,
because there's no gravity.

1709
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:14,600
You know what I mean?
Like,

1710
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:15,733
and so you have to,
you have to go out and I think actively 

1711
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,170
put yourself in situations that are 
going to challenge you,

1712
01:19:21,171 --> 01:19:23,240
going to test you.
And it doesn't all have to be physical.

1713
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:24,074
That's just one way in.
Find yourself in challenging mental 

1714
01:19:26,271 --> 01:19:27,104
situations.
Find yourself in challenging emotional 

1715
01:19:28,821 --> 01:19:29,654
situations,
emotionally challenging physical 

1716
01:19:30,951 --> 01:19:33,380
situation,
pulling crazy relationships.

1717
01:19:33,381 --> 01:19:35,260
Do they started fights,
right?

1718
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:36,223
They put,
they build up challenging emotional 

1719
01:19:38,091 --> 01:19:38,924
situations who they can escape them.
They make their own obstacle course to 

1720
01:19:41,631 --> 01:19:43,010
get through life.
No,

1721
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:43,910
you're totally right,
man.

1722
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:45,440
I think we're good.

1723
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:48,690
We're just experiencing an UN,
like the safest time ever.

1724
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:49,583
You know?
And we're sort of trying to find demons 

1725
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:52,860
don't exist instead of

1726
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,590
on the ones that do.
Yeah.

1727
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:57,510
And that's to me,
I think I mentioned it a couple times,

1728
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,220
but do you know if you're interested in 
wanting to tell that story,

1729
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:01,323
but about the time I did,
I wasco because these plant medicines 

1730
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:07,620
are that form of resistance.
It is a bit of a trial by fire.

1731
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:07,980
You know,

1732
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,710
it's going to,
you're going to confront yourself with,

1733
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:12,690
you know,
some of the darkest,

1734
01:20:12,691 --> 01:20:15,810
deepest fears and concerns that you 
have.

1735
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:16,680
And,
and that's,

1736
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,020
and that's the process by which it makes
you better.

1737
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:19,980
It's not,
you know,

1738
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:21,540
a magic potion.
It's just like,

1739
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:24,570
here's resistance.
How are you going to respond?

1740
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:27,480
And when you respond through that and 
you get,

1741
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:29,010
you just get better from it and you 
know,

1742
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:30,630
you feel better.
I wonder with,

1743
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:31,464
with California,
with this latest recreational marijuana 

1744
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:35,693
marijuana law passed,
I wonder how long it'll be before 

1745
01:20:37,891 --> 01:20:42,060
someone tries to do some sort of a 
psychedelic clinic,

1746
01:20:42,061 --> 01:20:42,894
whether it's for a addiction to opiates,
like a and a Boogie Boga I began a 

1747
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:52,830
clinic or um,
if this kratom stuff,

1748
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:53,350
you know,
this,

1749
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:55,530
there's shit,
what do you think about this?

1750
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:58,500
Cause I think I did a podcast with Chris
Bell the other day.

1751
01:20:58,860 --> 01:20:59,693
He was trying to explain it to me and to
me Kratom in mild doses it Kratom or is 

1752
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:03,960
it creative?

1753
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,470
I don't know.
Kratom Kratom I'm not,

1754
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,450
I'm not really sure.
I don't even,

1755
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:09,810
I'm in mild doses.
It seems to be like,

1756
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,340
uh,
like a bit of an energy.

1757
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:12,720
Yeah.
Energy buzz.

1758
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:13,583
And then in,
in heavier doses it seems to be more 

1759
01:21:15,481 --> 01:21:16,314
like a painkiller.
Like it's almost like a slightly 

1760
01:21:18,901 --> 01:21:22,740
euphoric but numbed sensations.
It's a really interesting plant.

1761
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:24,390
You know,
clearly I don't think there's any reason

1762
01:21:24,391 --> 01:21:25,224
for it to be illegal.
I haven't found personally a ton of 

1763
01:21:27,391 --> 01:21:29,940
value from it.
And I find value in some other things.

1764
01:21:29,941 --> 01:21:30,774
But the only thing I found disturbing,
I said I was getting a bunch of text 

1765
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:34,014
messages from people or tweets rather 
from people that were telling me that 

1766
01:21:36,841 --> 01:21:39,420
they had some addictive experiences with
it,

1767
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:42,090
that it was very addicted to them,
addictive to them.

1768
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,710
So I don't know if that's true or not.
Um,

1769
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:48,060
I also don't know where you're getting 
it and what's in it.

1770
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:48,950
Yeah.
You know,

1771
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:52,500
I don't,
I don't exactly know how pure that stuff

1772
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:52,801
is.
I mean,

1773
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:55,650
this stuff is this,
this is like a retail version of it.

1774
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:58,680
The Guy who sells it came with Chris.
I trust that.

1775
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:00,053
But if you're buying it from a dealer,
which is like essentially what a lot of 

1776
01:22:02,821 --> 01:22:04,400
people had to do for a long time.
Like what?

1777
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,100
I'm not exactly sure what you're 
getting,

1778
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,153
you know,
it's coming from Indonesia or wherever 

1779
01:22:08,761 --> 01:22:10,740
it's from.
I would like to see some real tests done

1780
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:12,000
because,
uh,

1781
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,930
to me,
I tried it.

1782
01:22:12,931 --> 01:22:14,850
I was like,
this is like a mild stimulant.

1783
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:15,990
I kept,
it kind of feels okay.

1784
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:17,440
Like it doesn't feel bad.
Yeah.

1785
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:18,863
You know,
it's interesting once you opened the 

1786
01:22:19,741 --> 01:22:22,440
doors to that scientific method with 
these plants,

1787
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:24,383
you find the amazing results.
And I think that's what we're seeing in 

1788
01:22:26,401 --> 01:22:27,234
this,
in this revolution of understanding of 

1789
01:22:28,281 --> 01:22:28,920
psychedelics.

1790
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,830
Like I just read an and tweeted about a 
study on,

1791
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:32,693
uh,
both silicide been an MDA for like 

1792
01:22:34,771 --> 01:22:37,360
social anxiety and social anxiety,
you know,

1793
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:38,243
which are one of the things that you 
think of the classic school shooters 

1794
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:40,621
syndrome,
you know,

1795
01:22:40,621 --> 01:22:43,620
it's this feeling of being excluded from
your tribe,

1796
01:22:43,621 --> 01:22:44,454
excluded from the social situation and 
the anxious and anxiety and all of the 

1797
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:50,430
medications that are prescribed for 
these different feelings of feeling like

1798
01:22:50,431 --> 01:22:51,960
you're not part of the group.
Well,

1799
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:52,794
they wanted to test that with both mgma 
and with silicide siliciden and they 

1800
01:22:57,121 --> 01:22:59,430
found that it was effective with both,
but differently.

1801
01:22:59,431 --> 01:23:01,230
So they created this game called Cyber 
Ball,

1802
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:02,064
right.
Where they had what seemed like just 

1803
01:23:03,481 --> 01:23:06,010
random other test subjects all in a 
circle

1804
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,450
with a ball.
And,

1805
01:23:07,451 --> 01:23:10,450
but really it was researchers and then 
one test subject.

1806
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:11,793
And so to create social anxiety,
they would play this game of catch and 

1807
01:23:14,621 --> 01:23:17,710
just not pass the ball hardly ever to 
the test subject.

1808
01:23:17,711 --> 01:23:19,660
So We'd feel eventually like,
man,

1809
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:20,494
what the fuck?
Why aren't these people passing me the 

1810
01:23:22,091 --> 01:23:23,800
ball?
Like what's wrong with me?

1811
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:27,880
And so they tapped into some and they 
would test that at baseline is placebo,

1812
01:23:27,881 --> 01:23:28,420
right?
The,

1813
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,700
the,
at least in the kind of concern of like,

1814
01:23:30,701 --> 01:23:31,540
man,
what's wrong with me?

1815
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:33,070
Why do these people not want to give you
the ball?

1816
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:35,320
And then they tested the baseline for 
Placebo,

1817
01:23:35,321 --> 01:23:37,540
gave him the whatever placebo they were 
using,

1818
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:38,523
and then they tested it with psilocybin.
And what they found with silicide been 

1819
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:45,550
was that it dramatically reduced their 
amount of anxiety,

1820
01:23:45,551 --> 01:23:48,300
their angst or stress about not giving 
the ball there.

1821
01:23:48,301 --> 01:23:50,140
They were just looking at him like,
man,

1822
01:23:50,141 --> 01:23:50,974
look at these people.
They just don't want to pass me the 

1823
01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:53,470
ball.
That's cool.

1824
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:55,710
You know,
and so and so,

1825
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:59,530
but they could accurately tell.
Now Mdm may also reduce social anxiety,

1826
01:23:59,531 --> 01:24:00,364
but in a different way.
The People Mtma thought they were 

1827
01:24:02,951 --> 01:24:03,784
getting the ball all the time.
They thought like they had no idea that 

1828
01:24:07,691 --> 01:24:09,220
they weren't on the ball.
They're like,

1829
01:24:09,221 --> 01:24:11,120
Oh man,
I got passed through all the time.

1830
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:12,860
It was amazing.
He loves money,

1831
01:24:12,861 --> 01:24:13,040
Dude.
They

1832
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,230
just will love and other people catching
the ball.

1833
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,340
Yeah.
So,

1834
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,830
so happy for you man.
You caught it.

1835
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,341
Oh,
you through it.

1836
01:24:19,341 --> 01:24:22,320
He got an a I'm happy for you too dude.
Yeah.

1837
01:24:22,321 --> 01:24:25,700
That an interesting Mtma can be 
extremely beneficial to anybody.

1838
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:29,810
At least one trip.
I just found the only trip that I did,

1839
01:24:29,811 --> 01:24:30,381
I was,
I was like,

1840
01:24:30,381 --> 01:24:32,570
this is really,
you can learn something from this.

1841
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:34,260
Well it's also,
you know,

1842
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,070
like a Mescalin which comes in both what
tumor,

1843
01:24:37,071 --> 01:24:42,071
the San Pedro Cactus and pay ot is also 
a Sarah to nudge it kind of psychedelic.

1844
01:24:42,201 --> 01:24:45,410
So if you haven't had a lot more to MDM,
very similar.

1845
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,273
Yeah.
I mean,

1846
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,130
MDM may is,
you know,

1847
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:52,610
like a more pharmaceutical approach to 
elevating serotonin in that feeling that

1848
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:55,100
this associated with selling Serotonin 
in your body,

1849
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:59,450
whereas the masculine drive,
psychedelics do that in a similar way,

1850
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,940
but with the little bit more of a 
visionary component.

1851
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:02,930
So,
um,

1852
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,140
but both have,
you know,

1853
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:08,720
once one is just a more direct 
application and I think that's great for

1854
01:25:08,721 --> 01:25:09,554
a situation like maps is testing with 
ptsd and certain other kinds of 

1855
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:14,720
situations because it's very 
reproducible.

1856
01:25:14,721 --> 01:25:18,380
It's very like clinical reaction of 
what's going to happen in the brain.

1857
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:22,970
Whereas something with like what Chuma 
gives you this overwhelming experience,

1858
01:25:22,971 --> 01:25:25,880
but it's woven in with all kinds of 
other different things.

1859
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:27,103
The problem really holy resides in the 
fact that these drugs are illegal 

1860
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:31,940
because if they,
if they weren't illegal we would look at

1861
01:25:31,941 --> 01:25:32,301
them.
It was like,

1862
01:25:32,301 --> 01:25:33,134
wow,
this might be solutions for people 

1863
01:25:33,981 --> 01:25:37,040
suffering from Ptsd,
from this,

1864
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:39,680
from that social anxiety,
social anxiety.

1865
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:40,783
And also kind of gives you your brain a 
chance to almost detached like a lens 

1866
01:25:45,831 --> 01:25:46,664
that detaches from the camera,
get a look at the inner workings of the 

1867
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:50,550
thing.
And then before you put it back on,

1868
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:52,100
you kind of get a better understanding 
of it.

1869
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:53,193
And so I guess there's a detachment that
MDA has like from some of the nonsense 

1870
01:25:57,861 --> 01:26:00,860
you've carried around with you,
like clothes that you know,

1871
01:26:00,861 --> 01:26:04,040
you've just worn it your whole life.
You don't realize bullshit until you

1872
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,010
take something that makes you feel like 
this is all so ridiculous.

1873
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:07,844
Like,
yeah,

1874
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:08,550
what,
what,

1875
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:09,361
what I think,
you know,

1876
01:26:09,361 --> 01:26:10,194
talking to the psychologist and the 
psychiatrist of why it's so beneficial 

1877
01:26:12,721 --> 01:26:13,554
is we all carry a lot of trauma.
We all carry these things from our past 

1878
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:17,243
that are the stories.
And I think that was another thing I 

1879
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:21,090
keep talking about the Jordan Peterson 
podcast,

1880
01:26:21,091 --> 01:26:23,070
but he talked about that self authoring 
program,

1881
01:26:23,071 --> 01:26:25,080
which is rewriting these stories.
Well,

1882
01:26:25,081 --> 01:26:26,580
he was talking about actually writing 
it,

1883
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:31,910
but what MDM is doing for people with 
Ptsd and with anybody is it's going back

1884
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:32,993
and looking at all of these traumatic 
things in our history and our past and 

1885
01:26:36,181 --> 01:26:39,240
which is also one of the things that in 
the studies that they're showing,

1886
01:26:39,241 --> 01:26:40,074
they have a psychologist,
psychiatrist who's guiding people back 

1887
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:46,290
to these potential traumatic events.
But when you're flooded with Serotonin,

1888
01:26:46,291 --> 01:26:48,210
you see things in a totally different 
perspective.

1889
01:26:48,211 --> 01:26:52,380
You see things from the vantage vantage 
point of love and it's all good.

1890
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:53,453
So no matter what situation came about,
you'll see that kind of higher 

1891
01:26:56,761 --> 01:26:58,770
perspective rather than that fear 
response,

1892
01:26:58,771 --> 01:27:02,370
that kind of cringing,
that creates more fear and more trauma.

1893
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:05,190
You look at it and you're able to relax,
see it and say,

1894
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:06,720
man,
that was pretty horrible,

1895
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:08,310
but you know what?
It's okay.

1896
01:27:08,311 --> 01:27:10,530
Like I'm still okay.
I still have these bright things.

1897
01:27:10,531 --> 01:27:12,490
And you repattern the,
uh,

1898
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:16,470
you repattern that traumatic experience.
So when you go to draw that back up from

1899
01:27:16,471 --> 01:27:17,304
your past,
you're drawing up a different 

1900
01:27:18,661 --> 01:27:19,494
recategorize experience.
Like you're rewriting the software 

1901
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:23,460
that's,
you know,

1902
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:26,340
always rewriteable like those 
rewriteable floppy disks.

1903
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:27,810
You know,
you take that thing out,

1904
01:27:27,811 --> 01:27:28,644
you rewrite it with a whole different 
hue of your neurochemicals in the 

1905
01:27:31,591 --> 01:27:34,830
feelings that you surrounding it.
And then when you access it again,

1906
01:27:34,831 --> 01:27:36,750
or when it's just carrying around in 
your,

1907
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:41,010
in your memory,
then it doesn't have the same sting.

1908
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:41,873
It doesn't have the same trauma.
And that's one of the mechanisms of 

1909
01:27:44,131 --> 01:27:44,964
action of of MDA and also what they're 
looking at with Iowasca Iowasca going 

1910
01:27:49,111 --> 01:27:49,944
back,
not flooding you necessarily with 

1911
01:27:51,181 --> 01:27:52,014
Serotonin,
but showing you that if these events in 

1912
01:27:54,001 --> 01:27:56,460
a slightly different perspective showing
you well,

1913
01:27:56,461 --> 01:27:57,294
hey that's actually what made you so 
ambitious and so strong and this 

1914
01:28:00,151 --> 01:28:01,820
traumatic thing that you thought was so 
horrible,

1915
01:28:01,821 --> 01:28:04,710
it actually brought out all of these 
other benefits and it was actually,

1916
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:05,843
you know,
if you really see from the person who 

1917
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:09,030
the perpetrators perspective,
you know,

1918
01:28:09,031 --> 01:28:12,180
look at all the sadness that created 
that look at where he was coming from so

1919
01:28:12,181 --> 01:28:16,260
you repattern that traumatic event and 
then it's not carrying that sign,

1920
01:28:16,261 --> 01:28:18,720
the same dramatic,
terrible weight,

1921
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:21,780
that lifeless body that you're trying to
carry around.

1922
01:28:21,781 --> 01:28:22,680
It's just been rewritten.

1923
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:28,140
There's also the perspective that who 
you are like as a person right now is an

1924
01:28:28,241 --> 01:28:30,670
accumulative effect of all your 
experiences.

1925
01:28:30,671 --> 01:28:32,260
That's what makes you who you are.
Well,

1926
01:28:32,261 --> 01:28:35,020
if you have some mind blowing 
experience,

1927
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:38,680
which is what the psychedelic 
experiences you are going to change,

1928
01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:40,390
like you're going to be a different 
person.

1929
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,313
I mean,
it might be a,

1930
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:42,573
a microscopic shifted the dial.
Like if you had a safe and you are 

1931
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:45,851
clicking click,
click,

1932
01:28:45,851 --> 01:28:46,684
click.
It might be like one click click like 

1933
01:28:47,951 --> 01:28:48,784
after a psychedelic experience and then 
you might have another psychedelic 

1934
01:28:50,441 --> 01:28:52,030
explains.
You might get a double click,

1935
01:28:52,031 --> 01:28:52,720
click,
click,

1936
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,430
you know,
but it's very small movements,

1937
01:28:54,431 --> 01:28:55,264
right?
But ultimately you're a different 

1938
01:28:57,341 --> 01:28:59,950
person.
So if even if it's a small movement,

1939
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:01,083
that new experience has given you a 
chance to sort of mock the things that 

1940
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:07,860
were threatening you just momentarily,
just as just a few moments ago,

1941
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:10,320
just four hours ago before he took the 
mushrooms,

1942
01:29:10,610 --> 01:29:11,071
he like,
God,

1943
01:29:11,071 --> 01:29:11,904
why was I worried about that?
That's nothing like it gives you that 

1944
01:29:13,741 --> 01:29:16,950
opportunity because you're literally a 
different person now.

1945
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:20,100
You've had this experience.
The fucking problem is they're illegal.

1946
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:21,023
If they weren't illegal,
you'd be able to eat because it has the 

1947
01:29:22,711 --> 01:29:23,491
big fear,
right?

1948
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:24,840
How do I know what I'm taking?
Of course,

1949
01:29:24,841 --> 01:29:27,270
how do you know what you're taking?
You don't fucking know.

1950
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:28,223
You don't know because big Daddy Pharma 
has paid off the fucking big daddy 

1951
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:35,940
government to keep it out of your greasy
little hands so you can't trip balls and

1952
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,680
live in the woods like a fucking Pixie.

1953
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:41,680
The beautiful thing is though,
it's common cause I think the open,

1954
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:44,380
as soon as they opened the doors to 
clinical research,

1955
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:48,640
it's an undeniable force.
Like you cannot deny the evidence that's

1956
01:29:48,641 --> 01:29:51,460
coming back from the maps.
You know phase two clinical trials.

1957
01:29:51,610 --> 01:29:52,443
You cannot deny the evidence coming out 
of Johns Hopkins and these are the 

1958
01:29:55,451 --> 01:29:56,284
research institutes about psilocybin.
They are helping people with conditions 

1959
01:29:59,681 --> 01:30:01,050
and you just,
you know,

1960
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:02,133
follow the scientific method all the way
through and all the plants are going to 

1961
01:30:04,391 --> 01:30:06,160
arrive.
Like we're going to get them all home.

1962
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:08,790
We've got to get trump on drugs for 
sure.

1963
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:08,980
We've

1964
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:12,630
got to get the new president to do DMT.
If we got him to do DMT,

1965
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:16,440
it would change so much or just just a 
little dose of mushrooms,

1966
01:30:16,441 --> 01:30:18,120
Bro.
You don't even have to get crazy.

1967
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:18,983
Take a gram and a half,
just a gram and a half or a little 

1968
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:21,700
reset.
Just a little reset,

1969
01:30:21,701 --> 01:30:23,130
just a little little sit back and a 
little,

1970
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:24,040
wow,
what?

1971
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,830
What are we doing here?
What are we doing here?

1972
01:30:25,831 --> 01:30:27,900
Exactly?
What are we doing here?

1973
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:29,333
I just think this is a unique and 
special time and as long as we can be 

1974
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,100
aware and as long as we,
we,

1975
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:39,690
we verbalize that.
We say it all the time.

1976
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:40,524
This is a unique and special time.
Let's capitalize on this unique and 

1977
01:30:43,141 --> 01:30:43,974
special time.
Let's use this unique and special time 

1978
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:51,530
to establish a new understanding for 
this generation and to set things up way

1979
01:30:52,261 --> 01:30:53,550
better for the next generation.

1980
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:54,840
Dude,
my parents,

1981
01:30:54,841 --> 01:30:55,674
I'm older than you.
My parents were essentially raised by 

1982
01:30:58,351 --> 01:31:02,160
barbarians.
They came over on a fucking boat.

1983
01:31:02,161 --> 01:31:04,830
They had no idea what was over here.
You know their,

1984
01:31:04,831 --> 01:31:07,590
their parents did it really like my 
grandparents parents did it.

1985
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,620
That came over from Italy and from 
Ireland.

1986
01:31:10,650 --> 01:31:12,120
They were savages,
man.

1987
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:13,043
They were hardly different from the 
people that came over on the boats 

1988
01:31:14,851 --> 01:31:17,400
during the pilgrim days.
There were barbarians.

1989
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:20,070
They just had a little bit more culture,
a little bit more language,

1990
01:31:20,071 --> 01:31:20,904
a little bit more.
This.

1991
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,610
They beat the shit out of their wives.
They were always drunk.

1992
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,110
There are monsters.
A lot of them,

1993
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:27,500
they're just crazy people scratching and
clawing.

1994
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:30,930
Their understanding of life during the 
Ed Sullivan show,

1995
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:33,510
their understanding of what the world 
was really all about.

1996
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,373
It's so far removed from the average 20 
year old with a an internet account who 

1997
01:31:38,851 --> 01:31:41,430
can go on youtube.
As long as he stays away from those flat

1998
01:31:41,431 --> 01:31:42,264
earth videos,
he's going to have a real good 

1999
01:31:43,561 --> 01:31:44,394
understanding of how this mother fucker 
works and a way better understanding 

2000
01:31:46,811 --> 01:31:51,811
than any grown adult with children did 
in the 1950s when my parents were kids.

2001
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:54,390
There's no fucking way.
There's no,

2002
01:31:54,391 --> 01:31:55,224
you can't compete.
So I think that we have this unique 

2003
01:31:57,991 --> 01:32:00,030
opportunity to set up the future

2004
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:03,880
society where all of this silliness that
we still have to deal with.

2005
01:32:03,881 --> 01:32:04,714
Like the wiki leaks email that came out 
about Hillary Clinton has said that she 

2006
01:32:06,851 --> 01:32:10,930
opposes marijuana quote in every sense 
of the word.

2007
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:14,800
You can't do that anymore.
You can't do that anymore.

2008
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:15,663
Like that to me,
that people were still willing to 

2009
01:32:16,961 --> 01:32:18,250
support that.
Like this,

2010
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:20,320
oh this is better than him.
He grabs pussies.

2011
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:22,480
Is it,
are you sure it's better?

2012
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:25,540
Cause I don't know if it's better.
I think the whole thing's a mess.

2013
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:29,230
You can't have people stopping pinebrook
Oh,

2014
01:32:29,231 --> 01:32:30,064
it's all both the part with you,
it's all about freedom and anybody that 

2015
01:32:33,371 --> 01:32:35,530
wants to stop pot,
they can stop sex,

2016
01:32:35,531 --> 01:32:36,364
they can stop whatever the fuck you want
to do that they decide they can profit 

2017
01:32:39,251 --> 01:32:40,084
off of.
You not doing that and you think they 

2018
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:43,300
can't stop sex.
Look what religion did to sex.

2019
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:44,020
Sure.
Right.

2020
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:47,830
Look how many people were burned for 
their sexual practices at the stake.

2021
01:32:47,831 --> 01:32:51,010
Literally like you can ban absolutely 
everything.

2022
01:32:51,011 --> 01:32:51,844
There's laws on the books that are 
throwing people in jail for 

2023
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:54,604
homosexuality that will flare up still 
now like a k in different places of the 

2024
01:32:58,961 --> 01:32:59,794
world where they'll kill people for sex.
So it's not that that hasn't even been 

2025
01:33:02,621 --> 01:33:03,900
tried,
like the,

2026
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:04,763
the ability of the monstrous nature of 
humans to be able to impose those 

2027
01:33:08,651 --> 01:33:11,260
restrictions on people of the 
sovereignty of their own consciousness.

2028
01:33:11,261 --> 01:33:13,990
And their own body.
You can only ejaculate this way.

2029
01:33:13,991 --> 01:33:17,200
You can only expand your consciousness 
in these manners.

2030
01:33:17,201 --> 01:33:18,034
Like women can't drive.
They have to dress like genies have to 

2031
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:21,920
cover themselves.
Genie.

2032
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:26,180
That's so wild.
But yeah,

2033
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:29,710
it's like we got to discard all that 
shit and it's idea that you know,

2034
01:33:29,711 --> 01:33:30,544
these,
these pastors have more knowledge than 

2035
01:33:32,351 --> 01:33:33,950
someone who just spent,
you know,

2036
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:36,670
a few days out in the woods doing 
mushrooms.

2037
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:37,503
Like,
are you sure you know the other ones 

2038
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:41,500
photo from heaven,
he's got a lock.

2039
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:42,250
Yeah,
he's,

2040
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,850
he's,
he's at all,

2041
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:45,123
there was a story that was out just a 
couple of days ago about some woman in 

2042
01:33:47,231 --> 01:33:51,250
Indonesia that received a hundred lashes
for like being around a man,

2043
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:52,084
being too close to a man.
There's a bunch of people that were 

2044
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:57,600
publicly flogged for sex crimes,
but there were sex crimes as similar,

2045
01:33:57,610 --> 01:33:58,301
like as,
as,

2046
01:33:58,301 --> 01:34:01,270
as innocuous as a woman was too close to
a man.

2047
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:04,540
Like they gave her like 90 lashes or 
some crazy shit.

2048
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:05,433
All the little boners on find the 
fucking robes west from the people who 

2049
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:09,544
are lashing.
The way I hear it as a student gets a 

2050
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:13,450
hundred lashes for sex outside marriage 
and Indonesia.

2051
01:34:13,451 --> 01:34:14,284
So he got a hundred lashes and there was
another one about a woman that dude 

2052
01:34:16,031 --> 01:34:16,864
looks just like the male dudes in that 
fucking sex bdsm dungeon porn from San 

2053
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:22,953
Francisco where they took that old 
prison out and they all fucking dress 

2054
01:34:24,711 --> 01:34:26,110
like that and locking people up.

2055
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:29,140
It's the same dude.
He just gets to do it in public.

2056
01:34:29,141 --> 01:34:30,550
Oh,
it's even extra kinky.

2057
01:34:30,551 --> 01:34:34,900
I got to whip people in fucking public.
She was flogged with a rat and candy.

2058
01:34:34,901 --> 01:34:36,220
Say Rattan.
How'd he say it?

2059
01:34:36,221 --> 01:34:37,120
Written cane.
Yeah.

2060
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:42,310
At least seven times for being too close
in close proximity to a man.

2061
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:47,140
So they beat her with a cane seven times
for being in close proximity to a man.

2062
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:51,190
That 32 year old male who was with her 
was also flogged seven times.

2063
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:52,653
Hmm.
That's interesting.

2064
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,270
Let's take a look at that sentence is 
structured.

2065
01:34:55,271 --> 01:34:58,160
The 34 old one was flogged with a Kane 
at least seven

2066
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,260
times being in close proximity to a man.
That's the Har.

2067
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:01,333
The 32 year old male who was with her 
was also flagged seven times like 

2068
01:35:03,711 --> 01:35:06,110
that's,
it's not the man and the woman were both

2069
01:35:06,111 --> 01:35:10,520
flag flog seven times each.
It's like the woman horror upon horrors.

2070
01:35:10,521 --> 01:35:11,354
This beautiful young woman was flogged 
because she had sex with a man or 

2071
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:17,000
because she was close to a man.
That dude was flogged too,

2072
01:35:17,001 --> 01:35:18,950
but fuck him.
You know,

2073
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,110
and the woman,
it hurts so bad.

2074
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:22,183
The woman said,
she cited AFP raising her arms in the 

2075
01:35:25,341 --> 01:35:26,360
air.
What about the dude?

2076
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:29,090
The dude didn't even ask him that.
Even ask the dude.

2077
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:29,921
Fuck him.
He said,

2078
01:35:29,921 --> 01:35:30,754
dude,
that fucking CIS gendered asshole with 

2079
01:35:32,991 --> 01:35:37,340
his male privilege is white mates 
probably white in Indonesia.

2080
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:39,320
They probably would have given them a 
hundred if he was black.

2081
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:42,370
Yeah,
man,

2082
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:44,910
it's,
I went to the dungeon of the inquisition

2083
01:35:44,911 --> 01:35:45,744
in Italy and that's,
that changed my whole perspective on 

2084
01:35:48,031 --> 01:35:48,670
everything.

2085
01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:50,020
Put that back up.
Let's do this one,

2086
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:52,900
but we'll go back to where you were.
Here we go.

2087
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:53,660
Look at this.
No,

2088
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:54,493
no,
no.

2089
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:55,673
Oh,
Jamie doesn't know how to do the 

2090
01:35:57,161 --> 01:35:59,860
Internet.
Okay.

2091
01:35:59,861 --> 01:36:00,694
The a man found guilty of sex outside 
the marriage was also flogged at least 

2092
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:04,924
22 times by the person delivering the 
punishment who is dressed in long robes 

2093
01:36:09,731 --> 01:36:10,564
and a hood.
His partner who was two months pregnant 

2094
01:36:12,821 --> 01:36:15,340
is still waiting for her fate to be 
decided,

2095
01:36:15,610 --> 01:36:16,443
wow,
she's pregnant and they're going to 

2096
01:36:17,771 --> 01:36:20,860
decide her fate.
Whoa.

2097
01:36:20,861 --> 01:36:21,694
In such situations,
officials in the province usually order 

2098
01:36:23,891 --> 01:36:26,500
the flogging of the woman after they 
give birth.

2099
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:31,060
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit.

2100
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:35,920
That's Indonesia 2016 that is holy Shit.
That's scary.

2101
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:40,510
That is just what happens when people 
decide what the rules are.

2102
01:36:40,511 --> 01:36:43,390
You can't let people decide the rules 
and

2103
01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:46,500
and Lou and have false metaphysical 
underpinnings,

2104
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:49,560
have that underpinning that.
That's someone who deserves that kind of

2105
01:36:49,561 --> 01:36:50,640
punishment,
you know,

2106
01:36:50,641 --> 01:36:51,960
have that,
you know,

2107
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,540
you lose the idea.
There's fundamental things.

2108
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:57,930
That's me living a different life.
What I want to do that to me like do you

2109
01:36:57,931 --> 01:36:58,764
understand the actual truth of the urges
that that person had and the truth of 

2110
01:37:02,071 --> 01:37:03,990
everything?
You start turning everything on its head

2111
01:37:03,991 --> 01:37:06,630
and then you get these crazy rules and 
abilities like,

2112
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:07,553
and it's not just Indonesia,
like I went to the dungeon of the 

2113
01:37:09,181 --> 01:37:13,200
inquisition in Italy and it was so much 
fucking darker than a cane.

2114
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:15,350
She may feel it when you're in the room 
for sure.

2115
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:16,373
It was,
it was nauseatingly especially when you 

2116
01:37:17,971 --> 01:37:21,360
start seeing that 60% of these fucking 
things have to do with your genitals,

2117
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:22,553
like burning rods.
They're shoving and Dick Holes and 

2118
01:37:24,961 --> 01:37:26,840
assholes and,
but it's all for Jesus the way.

2119
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:27,840
Yeah,
exactly.

2120
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:28,823
For Jesus,
like the absolute antithesis of the 

2121
01:37:32,251 --> 01:37:34,200
Jesus message when you really look at 
it.

2122
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:37,050
Mystically but like if like from the,
from the what,

2123
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:37,884
the metaphysical truths of what he's 
espousing and then somehow they go from 

2124
01:37:40,801 --> 01:37:42,480
that to that.
And I think it's,

2125
01:37:42,481 --> 01:37:44,820
again,
it's like that incremental creep,

2126
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:45,893
you know,
towards a little bit harsher 

2127
01:37:46,561 --> 01:37:48,960
punishments,
a little bit more sadistic,

2128
01:37:48,961 --> 01:37:49,794
you know,
and you get more and more and more and 

2129
01:37:51,691 --> 01:37:54,420
you get that,
you start feeding that urge for sadism,

2130
01:37:54,421 --> 01:37:56,610
that urge to,
to not only,

2131
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,100
you know,
punish somebody but to do it in the most

2132
01:37:59,101 --> 01:38:00,610
horrifying way.
And you know,

2133
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,190
that's part of human nature.

2134
01:38:02,290 --> 01:38:04,110
We know about the Stanford prison 
experiments,

2135
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:04,471
right?
Yeah,

2136
01:38:04,471 --> 01:38:05,290
exactly.
Yeah.

2137
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:07,860
If you haven't heard about that folks 
look it up.

2138
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:09,990
Um,
it's really interesting story.

2139
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:10,950
They,
um,

2140
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:14,460
they had these students and these 
college students at Stanford,

2141
01:38:14,461 --> 01:38:15,294
they put them through this experiment 
where some of them were guards and some 

2142
01:38:18,481 --> 01:38:19,314
of them were prisoners and the guards 
almost immediately started abusing the 

2143
01:38:22,411 --> 01:38:25,650
prisoners.
They fucking cancel it.

2144
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:27,680
They had to cancel.
They just stop it short.

2145
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:29,560
Yeah.
It's a,

2146
01:38:29,650 --> 01:38:31,180
and I think,
you know,

2147
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:33,380
the problem is,
is that we all try to,

2148
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:35,540
we all try to bury these,
these thoughts,

2149
01:38:35,541 --> 01:38:37,370
these darker thoughts that we have.
You know,

2150
01:38:37,371 --> 01:38:39,460
like all of us inside of us,
you know,

2151
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:43,070
you look at times of war and you know,
whole armies that would go,

2152
01:38:43,071 --> 01:38:45,590
part of why they would go on these 
contracts was for rape.

2153
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:46,873
You know,
like we all think of ourselves like as 

2154
01:38:48,511 --> 01:38:50,090
as men now,
like man,

2155
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:53,360
I would never be capable of of doing 
anything hurting anybody else.

2156
01:38:53,361 --> 01:38:54,194
But inside our genetics,
inside the things that was passed along 

2157
01:38:56,271 --> 01:38:57,104
our lineage where warrior cultures that 
probably produced are fucking ancestors 

2158
01:39:00,801 --> 01:39:04,340
through rape,
like that's part of every individual,

2159
01:39:04,341 --> 01:39:05,410
these dark thoughts.
This,

2160
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:08,270
it feels somehow good to hurt somebody 
else.

2161
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,730
And the fact that we deny those 
entirely,

2162
01:39:10,731 --> 01:39:12,440
they become monsters,
you know,

2163
01:39:12,441 --> 01:39:15,530
is where if you just acknowledge and 
like look at them and say,

2164
01:39:15,531 --> 01:39:16,970
man,
I'm all the bad stuff,

2165
01:39:16,971 --> 01:39:19,040
I'm all the good stuff,
it's all good.

2166
01:39:19,041 --> 01:39:20,720
What am I going to choose to do?
You know,

2167
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:25,190
what do I want to put out in the world?
And I think that's a really important,

2168
01:39:25,191 --> 01:39:27,860
important facet to recognize that,
you know,

2169
01:39:27,861 --> 01:39:29,570
we're all,
we're all fucked up,

2170
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:32,090
you know,
but it's our choice to decides,

2171
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:33,133
you know,
who we really are and what we want to 

2172
01:39:33,921 --> 01:39:34,754
bring into the world.
Are we going to make this amazing video 

2173
01:39:36,741 --> 01:39:38,600
game a better place,
a better game?

2174
01:39:38,610 --> 01:39:40,910
Are we going to make it miserable for 
everybody?

2175
01:39:40,911 --> 01:39:41,720
We encountered,

2176
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,090
I've always wondered about,
um,

2177
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:44,053
mob rules.
Like I've always wanted about the mob 

2178
01:39:46,281 --> 01:39:48,110
mentality.
Like what is that?

2179
01:39:48,170 --> 01:39:49,560
Where's that coming from?
Is that coming?

2180
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,640
Is that like an acceptance of war?
Like is that,

2181
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:53,533
I wonder if that's some sort of a 
survival mechanism when you able to do 

2182
01:39:56,241 --> 01:39:58,430
horrific shit,
as long as everybody around you is doing

2183
01:39:58,431 --> 01:40:00,470
horrific shit,
it's all a sudden the,

2184
01:40:00,471 --> 01:40:01,304
the,
the collective mindset shifts and new 

2185
01:40:03,591 --> 01:40:06,080
rules apply.
Like if people are coming over the fence

2186
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:08,270
and y'all have axes and you're coming 
out of them,

2187
01:40:08,271 --> 01:40:10,430
you're doing things you would never do 
on a daily basis.

2188
01:40:10,431 --> 01:40:12,740
You're hacking off arms and attacking 
people.

2189
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:14,030
And once it's real,
it's real.

2190
01:40:14,031 --> 01:40:15,620
Right?
Once the first guy gets an Arrow through

2191
01:40:15,621 --> 01:40:17,870
the fucking head and you see the shit 
going down,

2192
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:18,973
like you're swinging and it's all going 
crazy and everyone around you is doing 

2193
01:40:21,051 --> 01:40:22,880
the same thing and no one,
no one could go,

2194
01:40:22,881 --> 01:40:23,810
guys,
guys,

2195
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:25,380
seriously,
no,

2196
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:26,233
what are we doing?
Let's let's stop here and let's realize 

2197
01:40:28,401 --> 01:40:29,234
we could all get along.
There's plenty of vegetables for 

2198
01:40:30,261 --> 01:40:31,094
everybody.
Let's stop the rape and get to know 

2199
01:40:32,421 --> 01:40:35,840
these girls.
They'd cut your fucking head off and let

2200
01:40:35,841 --> 01:40:38,540
your house on fire and stab your mom.
They would go crazy.

2201
01:40:38,541 --> 01:40:39,860
I mean that's what they did.
Yeah,

2202
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:42,170
blood lust.
This is something,

2203
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:44,420
a thing,
because there's a,

2204
01:40:44,421 --> 01:40:45,254
something that happens.
There's a thing that happens to people 

2205
01:40:47,810 --> 01:40:49,190
when you have that mob mentality,

2206
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:50,103
you could probably look at like Steve,
someone like Steven Kotler can probably 

2207
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:54,190
you more about the,

2208
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:57,100
you know,
the adrenaline in neurochemical response

2209
01:40:57,101 --> 01:41:00,170
that's creating this version of yourself
that sucks,

2210
01:41:00,180 --> 01:41:02,830
supercharged and these certain things.
So your empathy,

2211
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:04,990
you know,
your empathy ratings go way down.

2212
01:41:04,991 --> 01:41:07,750
It's like you're looking at the 
westworld control board,

2213
01:41:07,751 --> 01:41:09,460
right?
And it's like empathy ratings,

2214
01:41:09,461 --> 01:41:10,294
way down,
aggression way up like all of these 

2215
01:41:12,371 --> 01:41:14,560
different neurochemicals that are 
changing,

2216
01:41:14,561 --> 01:41:15,394
like literally changing yourself into 
something that is much more favorable 

2217
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:20,950
for those actions.
Right.

2218
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:23,620
You know,
it creates a collective mindset.

2219
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:25,053
The individual,
because it's one of the things you hear 

2220
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:30,070
all the time about war is the,
the really noble,

2221
01:41:30,071 --> 01:41:33,940
heroic warriors who sacrifice themselves
to save others.

2222
01:41:34,070 --> 01:41:34,903
It's one of the main themes that we love
hearing about like the guy who dives on 

2223
01:41:38,831 --> 01:41:41,650
the grenade to save his people,
to save the guys who are around him.

2224
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:44,680
Like that is something that happens in 
that crazy,

2225
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:49,300
that crazy environment of that intensity
of life.

2226
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:50,403
It's one of the weirdest things about a 
man is how many people who go through 

2227
01:41:52,571 --> 01:41:56,050
that say it was the best time of their 
life and they'd love to go back.

2228
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:57,243
Yeah.

2229
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:58,051
Well,
presence,

2230
01:41:58,051 --> 01:41:58,884
man.
I really think that anytime your 

2231
01:41:59,911 --> 01:42:01,920
presence,
every time you're present,

2232
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:04,410
you're some of the best time in your 
life.

2233
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:05,580
Not like Christmas present.
Yeah.

2234
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,320
No.
Like when you're just present,

2235
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:08,154
like when you're,
you're in flow state when you're in war 

2236
01:42:09,901 --> 01:42:12,000
because part of it is that intense 
threat,

2237
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:12,893
you know,
like you don't have time to think about 

2238
01:42:14,251 --> 01:42:16,160
your email that incessant,
you know,

2239
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:19,500
voice from your phone to check.
Instagram is not in your fucking head.

2240
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:20,760
You're more,
you know,

2241
01:42:20,761 --> 01:42:21,870
and that's,
it lends,

2242
01:42:21,871 --> 01:42:25,180
some girl's been like dm and and Dan,
let's go on down,

2243
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:27,253
we'll meeting up tonight for sure.
And I think probably at a certain level 

2244
01:42:30,571 --> 01:42:31,404
of like Tim Kennedy,
he might have those thoughts like it's 

2245
01:42:33,061 --> 01:42:36,630
just so called for him.
Doesn't fuck well the Musashi thing.

2246
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:37,440
Yeah,
exactly.

2247
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,273
That's probably why you actually started
having to fight with oars because at a 

2248
01:42:40,291 --> 01:42:43,410
certain point with a sword,
he probably wasn't even getting the same

2249
01:42:43,411 --> 01:42:44,340
feeling anymore.

2250
01:42:44,370 --> 01:42:45,203
Right.
Probably didn't even feel like a sword 

2251
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:47,100
battle.
It was like a,

2252
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:48,143
like a sparring match when you know 
you're going 20% and you're all relaxed 

2253
01:42:50,971 --> 01:42:53,760
and shit rather than when you're just 
knowing like,

2254
01:42:53,761 --> 01:42:55,110
all right,
these people are coming for me.

2255
01:42:55,111 --> 01:42:58,020
It's a different kind of mental state 
that you get in.

2256
01:42:58,021 --> 01:42:59,030
And maybe,
you know,

2257
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,210
the or thing was like,
all right,

2258
01:43:00,211 --> 01:43:01,590
I'm just not feeling it.
I'm too good.

2259
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:02,543
Well,
he actually realized to that or had a 

2260
01:43:04,021 --> 01:43:07,320
much longer reach.
So who's cracking dudes in the head from

2261
01:43:07,321 --> 01:43:08,154
the outside?
So there was actually a good strategic 

2262
01:43:10,891 --> 01:43:12,180
element to the or,
and I said,

2263
01:43:12,181 --> 01:43:14,970
I'm pretty sure he whittled the or down 
like a,

2264
01:43:14,971 --> 01:43:18,370
and he would show up super late and then
he said to James,

2265
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:20,570
just be so tired.
They'd be just freak.

2266
01:43:20,571 --> 01:43:21,700
Oh my God,
am I gonna die tonight?

2267
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:24,510
They'd be thinking of that for hours and
then finally shows up.

2268
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:26,400
Yeah.
But back then mean,

2269
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:28,590
what do they had fucking Sun dials on 
the wrists.

2270
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:31,200
How'd you even know what time it was?
You could definitely get away with a lot

2271
01:43:31,201 --> 01:43:33,660
more.
There's a lot of wiggle room for fucking

2272
01:43:33,661 --> 01:43:35,610
dawn.
What's done to you bro?

2273
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:41,330
Midday to midday is a real fucking day.
We're supposed to meet Jesus high noon.

2274
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,400
Come on.
What does that even mean?

2275
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:46,800
Yeah.
Unless you're around a Sundial.

2276
01:43:47,730 --> 01:43:49,770
Yeah.
And even that seems like it'd be hard to

2277
01:43:49,771 --> 01:43:51,280
get that right.
Nobody had that on rest.

2278
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:52,123
I was only the flintstones.

2279
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:59,790
Flintstones fucking Sundial.
That's hilarious.

2280
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:01,373
I wonder who the front,
the first dude with a watch that he 

2281
01:44:02,661 --> 01:44:03,910
carried around.
What a pimp doc.

2282
01:44:03,911 --> 01:44:08,911
I must've been clap mother fucker.
He opens it up like a coffin flavor.

2283
01:44:11,241 --> 01:44:14,510
Flave size hanging from his neck.
Like when,

2284
01:44:14,610 --> 01:44:15,443
let's,
let's just guess when was the first 

2285
01:44:17,541 --> 01:44:22,541
pocket watch created?
I'm going to say 16 hundreds is that,

2286
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:27,350
is that ambitious?
I say 1712 woo.

2287
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:29,390
Jamie civic.
Very specific.

2288
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:30,440
It's like price is right,
right.

2289
01:44:30,441 --> 01:44:33,710
The very first pocket watch.
If you have a pocket watch tape,

2290
01:44:33,711 --> 01:44:34,670
by the way,
you're an asshole.

2291
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:38,600
If it's hanging from your vest and a 
string and you drinking handmade beer,

2292
01:44:38,601 --> 01:44:42,260
you piece of shit.
Stop using mustache wax.

2293
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:43,633
Stop,
stop dressing like you live in a 

2294
01:44:44,661 --> 01:44:45,810
different time zone.

2295
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:49,670
What did those,
those brothers,

2296
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:50,533
those brothers that used to,
everybody had drank out of mason jars 

2297
01:44:52,821 --> 01:44:53,654
and all the wood was raw.
All their commercials like they're all 

2298
01:44:55,701 --> 01:44:59,360
wearing spat.
Damn Tino for wow.

2299
01:44:59,370 --> 01:45:02,710
Are Way smarter than I give him credit.
Why don't we were both off by,

2300
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:06,110
I was on Bart over a hundred years to 
work about 40 hours though.

2301
01:45:06,370 --> 01:45:08,270
But good enough dude.
Why so picky?

2302
01:45:08,271 --> 01:45:09,104
40 hours as a whole week.
You could use it for the week for 

2303
01:45:11,181 --> 01:45:12,980
working.
Huh?

2304
01:45:13,010 --> 01:45:15,110
Look at it.
They were small enough to be worn around

2305
01:45:15,111 --> 01:45:17,210
the neck or carried it in a bag or 
pocket.

2306
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:19,970
Interesting.
Did they have a photo of one of those?

2307
01:45:19,971 --> 01:45:22,820
Is someone,
one of those still exist today?

2308
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:25,290
See if it still exists.
Gangster.

2309
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:27,590
Cause you get a statue made out of you.
If you could invent the pocket,

2310
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:29,060
whatever,
you're a dope motherfucker.

2311
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:30,013
Cause he didn't know.
But that was what led to the Apple 

2312
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:33,470
Watch.
He didn't know at the time it's going to

2313
01:45:33,471 --> 01:45:34,310
be,
you can never get away.

2314
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:35,180
Is that what it looked like?

2315
01:45:37,220 --> 01:45:39,260
Hmm.
I wonder,

2316
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:41,630
do you think you'd just slapped that 
thing out on the table?

2317
01:45:41,631 --> 01:45:42,464
If you're trying to impress a girl,
fuck this giant giant like Harare keys 

2318
01:45:48,030 --> 01:45:49,910
for archies never stay in the pocket.
Right.

2319
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:51,303
Breaking those things out.
Always wearing like a ring going around 

2320
01:45:53,481 --> 01:45:54,350
your finger.
Wow.

2321
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,690
Look at the mechanism in that thing.
Holy Shit,

2322
01:45:56,691 --> 01:45:58,370
man.
That's gorgeous.

2323
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:01,740
That's a thing that people super dork 
out about madness.

2324
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,920
Handmade watches.
Yeah,

2325
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:06,020
I didn't,
I had no idea.

2326
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,750
My friend Mark Della Grad [inaudible],
you know markdale grantee.

2327
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:12,770
Mark del Grande's a watch nut.
So was a Anthony Giordano.

2328
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,170
What a fucking coincidence.
Two guineas.

2329
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:20,300
Two shiny guineas.
I really watched nuts,

2330
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:21,560
but uh,
they did.

2331
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:24,080
Anthony was telling me that there's a 
anthony's,

2332
01:46:24,081 --> 01:46:27,740
the guy was directed all my,
except one of my comedy specials.

2333
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:29,480
I love that dude.
He's directly UFC too.

2334
01:46:30,170 --> 01:46:31,070
He told me that,
uh,

2335
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:32,990
there's watches that are half a million 
bucks,

2336
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:37,200
like insane for a watch.
I go,

2337
01:46:37,230 --> 01:46:38,670
it just is what it looks like a regular 
watch.

2338
01:46:38,671 --> 01:46:39,920
She's like,
it looks like a regular watch.

2339
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:42,090
What's the deal?
It's really rare then,

2340
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:43,370
you know,
it's very accurate.

2341
01:46:43,371 --> 01:46:45,200
The mechanism,
it was like super complex,

2342
01:46:45,201 --> 01:46:47,720
all handmade and it takes like six 
months to make one.

2343
01:46:47,721 --> 01:46:48,554
I'm like,
what?

2344
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:49,980
Take six months to

2345
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,120
make a watch.
You know,

2346
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:52,080
you get,
we have this one,

2347
01:46:52,081 --> 01:46:55,020
219,000.
Oh my God.

2348
01:46:55,021 --> 01:46:56,310
What does that,
what does it look like?

2349
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:59,490
That's it.
That's definitely not it.

2350
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:02,190
Oh my God.
It looks like a transformer.

2351
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:03,750
Click on that.
Looks like a Cobra.

2352
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:07,530
Oh,
it's probably loading.

2353
01:47:07,531 --> 01:47:09,520
Still.
See how it's spinning up in the right at

2354
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:10,500
the top.
I don't know.

2355
01:47:10,501 --> 01:47:11,490
It's just not coming up.
Huh?

2356
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:12,780
Should we fished?
Be loaded fast.

2357
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:15,180
Wow though.
Holy Shit.

2358
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:16,014
Click on the image.
Just clicking the image instead of the 

2359
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:19,260
link.
What the fuck man?

2360
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:22,920
$219,000
for the ugliest watch you've ever worn,

2361
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:27,390
but everybody's going to know it's 
$200,000

2362
01:47:27,391 --> 01:47:30,280
and that's the rub son.
I uh,

2363
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:31,303
Hubo it's funny.
So my buddy bodie was sponsored by them 

2364
01:47:34,021 --> 01:47:36,540
and he got a bunch of watches and he 
just doesn't care about watches.

2365
01:47:36,541 --> 01:47:39,630
So they were just like in the drawer 
with like the regular other stuff.

2366
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:44,520
And I finally convinced him to flat to 
give me one and it's sweet,

2367
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:47,250
but it's not like a big deal.
Like it's disgusting.

2368
01:47:47,251 --> 01:47:48,084
That thing is ridiculous.
That is so like a safe vault that looks 

2369
01:47:50,851 --> 01:47:54,000
like they would sell it at best buy in 
the line before you leave,

2370
01:47:54,001 --> 01:47:54,834
where they have the candy.
They got that design from sharper image 

2371
01:47:56,461 --> 01:47:57,960
for sure.
From sharper image.

2372
01:47:58,860 --> 01:47:59,693
That is so ugly.
That is such a weird looking stupid 

2373
01:48:02,581 --> 01:48:03,930
watch.
Look at that guy.

2374
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:06,000
So site,
look at it.

2375
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,810
Look at his yellow eyes like the dude 
from sin city.

2376
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:13,890
He's like how rich banks.
Thank God he's so happy.

2377
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:14,873
He's going to jump in his Ferrari and 
take it to his private jet and cause 

2378
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:19,530
Dick talked to all the way to Monaco.

2379
01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:25,290
That'll probably happen.
Look at those fucking ugly watches man.

2380
01:48:25,291 --> 01:48:27,770
They're so gross.
Look at the one where the guy's wrist in

2381
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:30,030
the upper right hand corner.
Jamie up there.

2382
01:48:30,031 --> 01:48:30,480
Yeah.
Look,

2383
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,610
look how big.
That stupid thing is.

2384
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:35,210
Definitely needs to be bigger.
That is crazy.

2385
01:48:35,211 --> 01:48:38,190
It looks like an alien locked onto that 
dude's wrist.

2386
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:43,370
Like some alien bug like like the 
running man fucking the neck,

2387
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:47,380
the neck piece.
They would explode like that.

2388
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:50,040
Watch might just clamp down and remove 
your hand.

2389
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:53,430
Blow your hand off.
Squirt,

2390
01:48:53,431 --> 01:48:54,600
squirt,
squirt.

2391
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:56,310
Yeah.
Fuck that.

2392
01:48:56,311 --> 01:48:59,880
Watch $219,000
that's so stupid.

2393
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:02,010
It's ugly.
Yeah.

2394
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:02,903
Swatch costs just another way to,
none of the way to subtly shit on 

2395
01:49:05,911 --> 01:49:07,410
people.
Weird man.

2396
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:10,950
Just show your show your status,
your identity and blah blah blah.

2397
01:49:10,951 --> 01:49:11,780
It's,
you know,

2398
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:13,260
it's these,
these games,

2399
01:49:13,261 --> 01:49:15,900
the games that we like to play to,
to push our,

2400
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:20,220
to what Jordan was saying,
like create that temporary inequality,

2401
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:21,960
you know,
create that appearance of inequality.

2402
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:26,130
I'm better than everybody because I have
this giant fucking safe fault on my,

2403
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:27,263
on my hand that's had a conversation 
with this dude about watches and I was 

2404
01:49:30,881 --> 01:49:31,681
like,
what kind of watches that,

2405
01:49:31,681 --> 01:49:32,640
I guess it was one of those,
uh,

2406
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:33,523
mvmt watches as a sponsor of the podcast
and they only cost like 150 bucks and 

2407
01:49:37,471 --> 01:49:38,550
they're dope.
They're nice,

2408
01:49:38,670 --> 01:49:39,503
they're real,
they're really nice looking watches and 

2409
01:49:41,161 --> 01:49:41,821
he's like,
Oh man,

2410
01:49:41,821 --> 01:49:42,930
I thought it was a nice watch.
I go,

2411
01:49:42,931 --> 01:49:45,540
but you thought it was a nice watch b.
Dot.

2412
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:46,374
It was a nice watch,
but now it's not a nice wash cause you 

2413
01:49:47,441 --> 01:49:48,280
know,
it's only 150

2414
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:50,490
bucks.
It's still,

2415
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:52,930
it's still the same watch.
It tells time,

2416
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:54,670
look at it,
see it tells time.

2417
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:55,751
Said,
what is this?

2418
01:49:55,751 --> 01:49:57,820
How much is this piece of shit?
5 million.

2419
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:01,020
Oh my God.
It's the same company q bolt.

2420
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:03,820
So you bought this,
whatever.

2421
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:06,550
They've figured out how to find the 
retards.

2422
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:10,030
They figured out how to lock them in.
This one down here is 25 million.

2423
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:12,210
Oh my Jesus.
Fucking cool.

2424
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:14,360
What is that?
This is the watch park.

2425
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:17,560
That's like a stellar nursery.
That's what it is.

2426
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:20,250
That's how many million?
25 minutes.

2427
01:50:20,410 --> 01:50:22,900
If you're a chick and you can get a guy 
to buy you that,

2428
01:50:22,901 --> 01:50:27,630
your pussy is gold.
You must have that Super Pussy that that

2429
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:28,473
snap and pussy.
The Richard Pryor used to talk about in 

2430
01:50:29,681 --> 01:50:32,230
this whole records.
Yeah,

2431
01:50:32,231 --> 01:50:35,050
it's the pussy that extends into the 
soul.

2432
01:50:35,910 --> 01:50:38,560
30 million.
Is it a pocket watch?

2433
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:39,633
The pocket watches 30 million.
So you're an asshole and you spent $30 

2434
01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:44,800
million cause anyone with a pocket 
watches an alcohol.

2435
01:50:45,370 --> 01:50:46,480
What is that thing?
Look at it.

2436
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:47,493
It says it was started work on in 1782 
and was finished in 1827 by the guy's 

2437
01:50:52,030 --> 01:50:52,910
son.
Oh,

2438
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:56,170
that's different.
That's different.

2439
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:57,033
That is wicked.
So that that was a long to make that 

2440
01:51:01,181 --> 01:51:03,130
watch men's.
You get drunk and left out at the bar.

2441
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:05,590
Hey guys,
I'm super sorry.

2442
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:09,880
Did you see a price live watch?
It's worth a couple of houses.

2443
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:14,890
It's worth more than a couple 30 million
to work with a fucking mansion and a jet

2444
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:16,563
in the hamptons.
You can live in the hamptons off a 

2445
01:51:17,451 --> 01:51:20,200
watch.
Imagine that you get by the whole,

2446
01:51:20,210 --> 01:51:21,050
you can just say,
uh,

2447
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:23,710
how you gonna pay.
I'm going to give you a watch.

2448
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:28,210
Like what?
Imagine going back to like going back to

2449
01:51:28,211 --> 01:51:33,211
like a primitive more tribal culture and
like explaining how much value you could

2450
01:51:33,581 --> 01:51:35,230
get for something silly like that.

2451
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:35,960
You know,
like,

2452
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:36,793
like there was this watch and I could 
buy houses and have control vast lands 

2453
01:51:40,541 --> 01:51:44,650
and get unlimited food and,
and make people evolve varieties,

2454
01:51:44,651 --> 01:51:47,290
do all the things I wanted just from 
this one little token.

2455
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:48,880
And they'd be like,
well what does it do?

2456
01:51:48,881 --> 01:51:52,240
And you're like,
nothing does nothing but it's valuable.

2457
01:51:52,610 --> 01:51:53,441
You know,
they would be like,

2458
01:51:53,441 --> 01:51:55,840
what the fuck are you talking about?
Like there's not a better arrow.

2459
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,830
Like it's not a better,
you know,

2460
01:51:57,850 --> 01:51:58,683
it's just this,
it's one of these things that comes up 

2461
01:52:00,101 --> 01:52:03,610
when you get a a society of of luxury 
like we have.

2462
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:04,473
Yeah,
yeah.

2463
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:08,140
That's the status purchase.
The status purchase.

2464
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:10,150
It's interesting.
They're not even good.

2465
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,580
That's what a lot of them are not good.
Like,

2466
01:52:12,581 --> 01:52:14,980
uh,
I've never bought a rolex for myself,

2467
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:17,860
but the UFC bought me a rolex long time 
ago.

2468
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:20,140
It's just,
it's beautiful watch.

2469
01:52:20,170 --> 01:52:21,040
Right?
Beautiful.

2470
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:24,370
But he was always running fast,
like five minutes fast.

2471
01:52:24,730 --> 01:52:27,130
So I brought it in and I'm like,
I don't know what it is.

2472
01:52:27,131 --> 01:52:28,960
But like after a month,
it's like five minutes fast.

2473
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:30,280
The Guy Goes,
oh yeah,

2474
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,020
yeah.
They always do that.

2475
01:52:32,021 --> 01:52:34,360
So you just got to bring it back and 
reset it every month.

2476
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:35,643
I went,
what?

2477
01:52:36,130 --> 01:52:37,840
Like you have the change at the time 
every month.

2478
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:40,360
This,
this watch,

2479
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:42,010
I don't know how much it costs.
I don't even remember,

2480
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:44,830
but I don't have to change the time.
It's always right.

2481
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:45,950
It's right.
It runs,

2482
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:47,240
it's got a quartz movement.
He's like,

2483
01:52:47,241 --> 01:52:48,074
Oh yeah,
a quartz movement is just going to be 

2484
01:52:48,531 --> 01:52:49,790
more accurate than this.
Well,

2485
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:52,580
why is what wait a minute.
So these are just bad.

2486
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:53,713
They just suck at telling the time.
They still fucking so bad to tell them 

2487
01:52:56,721 --> 01:53:00,260
the time to like five seconds or five 
minutes fast after like,

2488
01:53:00,261 --> 01:53:01,550
uh,
just a couple of months.

2489
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:03,650
So you just got to accept that that's 
it.

2490
01:53:03,651 --> 01:53:05,750
You just accept it doesn't really keep 
time.

2491
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:09,190
It's Sordo keeps time.
The status with his dad,

2492
01:53:09,191 --> 01:53:12,110
his bracelet that happens to keep time.
How weird is that?

2493
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:15,560
They did not get in it.
You have to check like with sea up.

2494
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:16,520
Nope.
Launches off.

2495
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:17,473
Hold on.
We'll watch like you've watched this 

2496
01:53:18,621 --> 01:53:21,410
gets off.
Like you rely on the actual real clocks,

2497
01:53:21,411 --> 01:53:22,244
like this fucking piece of shit that we 
wouldn't be spending like four bucks on 

2498
01:53:25,101 --> 01:53:27,740
this,
that things right all the time.

2499
01:53:27,770 --> 01:53:28,603
It's never wrong.
You wind that bitch up to four o'clock 

2500
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:33,710
it and then when it's five it'll show 
you it's five.

2501
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:35,540
It's fucking right.
It's always right.

2502
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:39,710
It didn't cost anything.
Yup.

2503
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:41,690
Yup.
But that's rolex bitch

2504
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:46,170
doesn't satisfy the ego in the same way.
It doesn't get it fired up.

2505
01:53:46,171 --> 01:53:49,100
It doesn't let you get to feel better 
about yourself.

2506
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,120
So that,
you know,

2507
01:53:50,121 --> 01:53:52,550
I think when you really don't know,
again,

2508
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:53,810
going back,
you don't know the self,

2509
01:53:53,811 --> 01:53:57,530
you want to feel better by your,
about yourself by making yourself better

2510
01:53:57,531 --> 01:54:00,380
than somebody else because you have no 
other reference point of what it is.

2511
01:54:00,381 --> 01:54:01,161
So,
all right,

2512
01:54:01,161 --> 01:54:03,590
if I'm better than these other people,
you know,

2513
01:54:03,591 --> 01:54:04,424
whether it's something you have or 
something you are inherently are the 

2514
01:54:06,771 --> 01:54:09,470
Melanin in your skin or whatever the 
fuck you want to say.

2515
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:11,420
If that makes you better than someone 
else,

2516
01:54:11,421 --> 01:54:14,540
then you can,
then you can feel better about yourself.

2517
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:15,650
Well,
I don't know who I am.

2518
01:54:15,651 --> 01:54:16,484
I don't know if I'm good or bad,
but at least I'm better than these 

2519
01:54:18,021 --> 01:54:19,030
fucks.
You know?

2520
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:21,500
And then that makes you feel better.
But it's all,

2521
01:54:21,501 --> 01:54:24,590
it's all this fucking bullshit game that
we try to tell ourselves.

2522
01:54:24,591 --> 01:54:25,424
It comes from the fundamental lack of 
knowing who we are and knowing that 

2523
01:54:28,461 --> 01:54:30,980
whoever we are is enough and it's all 
good.

2524
01:54:30,981 --> 01:54:31,814
And we're all the same.

2525
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:33,930
You say that,
but Boris,

2526
01:54:33,931 --> 01:54:35,870
the guy with that fucking transformer on
his rest,

2527
01:54:35,871 --> 01:54:36,704
he was getting his dick sucked right now
while drinking vodka flying his private 

2528
01:54:39,151 --> 01:54:41,610
jet over the Atlantic.
He disagrees with you.

2529
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:43,613
That girl knows that that's a $250 
million watch or whatever the fuck he's 

2530
01:54:47,071 --> 01:54:47,904
wearing it.
She knows he's bawling adequate control 

2531
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:54,090
on his private jet.
It's covered with feathers.

2532
01:54:58,140 --> 01:55:00,510
Boris got his whole jet decked out like 
an eagle.

2533
01:55:03,330 --> 01:55:08,330
The wings actually flat somehow makes 
the flying worse that they flat just for

2534
01:55:09,421 --> 01:55:12,490
effect and that's when he starts coming.
Ah,

2535
01:55:12,750 --> 01:55:16,680
when the eagle wings flap,
while he's looking at his watch,

2536
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:21,060
oh he looks at his watch at the girl and
then out the window in that order,

2537
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:25,850
the best,
the best moment of his life.

2538
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:26,753
And then he shoots himself in the head 
cause he knows it will never be any 

2539
01:55:28,441 --> 01:55:29,274
better.

2540
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:30,713
Everything has been building to that 
shoots a couple holes in the plane so 

2541
01:55:33,451 --> 01:55:35,830
that it fucking crashes and then shoots 
himself.

2542
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:37,793
There was,
the Eagle Wings would clearly bring the 

2543
01:55:39,301 --> 01:55:40,134
plane down.
Actually the minute you activated Eagle 

2544
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:44,890
Wing,
that plane is fucking taken.

2545
01:55:44,891 --> 01:55:47,700
It taken a nose dive and a captain 
solely.

2546
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:49,650
No one's ever gone out on top,
right.

2547
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:52,080
No one's ever had like the ultimate life
like that.

2548
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:52,973
And then you said,
I think it doesn't get any better than 

2549
01:55:54,631 --> 01:55:55,620
this.
Let's just,

2550
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:56,970
we're good.
We're good.

2551
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,340
Boom.
No,

2552
01:55:59,490 --> 01:56:02,610
I was watching the Loma Chenko uh,
walters fight the other night.

2553
01:56:02,611 --> 01:56:03,930
Did you see that fight,
that boxing match?

2554
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:07,440
God Damn facil look,
think you save a seal.

2555
01:56:07,470 --> 01:56:11,230
If I see a woman Chanko the silly I've 
heard Wassily um,

2556
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:14,310
but Lama Chanko is a masterful boxer.
I mean,

2557
01:56:14,311 --> 01:56:15,144
he just boxed it shit out of this dude.
This dude was undefeated and just 

2558
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:19,643
footwork,
just unbelievable footwork and ability 

2559
01:56:23,371 --> 01:56:25,710
to predict where his,
where the punches are coming from,

2560
01:56:25,711 --> 01:56:27,720
his opponent where he's going to have 
openings.

2561
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:28,853
And he was just lightened this dude up 
in the last round and a at the end of 

2562
01:56:31,891 --> 01:56:33,630
the last round,
that dude just quit.

2563
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:35,790
He just quit.
He quit in the seventh round.

2564
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:37,020
Just said,
I'm done.

2565
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:38,393
Like he didn't get knocked down.
He didn't get like we got staggered in 

2566
01:56:42,211 --> 01:56:44,580
the six round or in the seventh round.
He gets staggered,

2567
01:56:45,210 --> 01:56:46,043
but it wasn't to the point where you 
thought they would end the fight cause 

2568
01:56:47,221 --> 01:56:49,410
he ended the round on his feet,
went back to his corner,

2569
01:56:49,411 --> 01:56:50,530
walked,
sat down.

2570
01:56:50,531 --> 01:56:51,450
I was like,
fuck this,

2571
01:56:52,030 --> 01:56:54,210
it's over.
And then you know,

2572
01:56:54,211 --> 01:56:55,980
in his post fight speech was just 
basically saying,

2573
01:56:55,981 --> 01:56:57,210
look,
the guy was hitting me too much.

2574
01:56:57,660 --> 01:56:59,130
I just thought I saw the writing on the 
wall.

2575
01:56:59,160 --> 01:56:59,993
Check,
please.

2576
01:57:00,510 --> 01:57:02,940
That's smart actually.
What people should do that you just want

2577
01:57:02,941 --> 01:57:06,270
to see him for your own,
for your own desires.

2578
01:57:06,270 --> 01:57:07,710
You want to see him go out on their 
shield.

2579
01:57:07,711 --> 01:57:10,680
Like that's the noble way to do it.
Knock you out.

2580
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:13,650
Do you know why Pat Barry vs check 
Congo.

2581
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:15,740
Remember that shit?
Yeah.

2582
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:16,793
You just never know.
Never Know Pat Barry vs check Congo was 

2583
01:57:19,441 --> 01:57:24,140
like one of the craziest one round.
Slobber knockers ever Pat Barry.

2584
01:57:24,141 --> 01:57:24,974
I had checked Congo all kinds or hurt 
had him staggered and Pat Barry super 

2585
01:57:30,301 --> 01:57:31,134
aggressive.
He's trying it on and smashing check 

2586
01:57:33,871 --> 01:57:38,790
Congo and add a know where Congo on 
corks all bomb.

2587
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:41,610
I mean,
pat has got check Congo,

2588
01:57:41,611 --> 01:57:43,470
all kinds of hurt.
He's rocks.

2589
01:57:43,471 --> 01:57:46,500
And with that overhand right co Congo 
gets up,

2590
01:57:46,501 --> 01:57:48,960
he's tagging them and it looks like he's
almost out of his feet.

2591
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:50,820
I mean,
he's getting hit by bombs here.

2592
01:57:50,821 --> 01:57:51,654
He's all kinds of hurt.
Pat Barry sprawl and he keeps a fight 

2593
01:57:54,271 --> 01:57:55,104
standing as Congo tries to take them 
down and hits with another right hand 

2594
01:57:56,730 --> 01:57:58,110
rock some again,
boom,

2595
01:57:58,230 --> 01:57:59,310
another couple punches.

2596
01:57:59,310 --> 01:58:00,143
And He,
Pat Barry Looks fucking unstoppable 

2597
01:58:01,771 --> 01:58:03,060
here.
Look at this again.

2598
01:58:03,090 --> 01:58:05,120
But now as he closes in,
boom,

2599
01:58:05,121 --> 01:58:06,310
he gets clipped with that right hand in 
hand.

2600
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:10,650
How cold?
Two punches later out of nowhere.

2601
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:11,513
Crazy.
I mean that is as close as someone's 

2602
01:58:13,501 --> 01:58:17,280
comes to the brink of disaster and come 
back instantaneously,

2603
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:21,110
instantaneously and won by knockout,
wasn't it?

2604
01:58:21,130 --> 01:58:23,370
Didn't Chris leave and do that to 
somebody?

2605
01:58:24,150 --> 01:58:24,983
Vandelay he did it.
The vandelay starched vandelay vandelay 

2606
01:58:27,121 --> 01:58:28,770
came out and blast him with the right 
hand.

2607
01:58:28,771 --> 01:58:29,604
Had him hurt,
but he fell into the trap because lead 

2608
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:32,693
punches so fucking hard.
And he always had an iron chin and you 

2609
01:58:35,511 --> 01:58:37,860
just uncorked one on vandelay vendor and
like,

2610
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,410
oh,
nothing happened weekend.

2611
01:58:41,411 --> 01:58:42,010
Right.
Did you watch

2612
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,170
the bride?
Was it Derek Brunson fought?

2613
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:45,110
Yes.
Yeah.

2614
01:58:45,230 --> 01:58:48,650
Well similar in a way,
but more calculated.

2615
01:58:49,190 --> 01:58:50,023
Dark Bahnson just got crazy and he,
it fought Robert Whitaker who won the 

2616
01:58:53,581 --> 01:58:56,240
ultimate fighter Australia smashes 
addition.

2617
01:58:56,241 --> 01:58:58,040
Was it Australia versus England?
Is that what it was?

2618
01:58:58,070 --> 01:59:00,230
No,
I forget what it was.

2619
01:59:00,231 --> 01:59:02,750
What did they,
what who was competing on anyway,

2620
01:59:02,810 --> 01:59:07,190
whitaker one and a whitaker since moving
up to one 85.

2621
01:59:07,191 --> 01:59:11,060
He's just so much better than it was at 
one 70 and Derek Brunson just came after

2622
01:59:11,061 --> 01:59:11,894
him.
Derek bronze is the same guy who he had 

2623
01:59:13,341 --> 01:59:15,140
just knocked out,
um,

2624
01:59:15,380 --> 01:59:18,230
uriah hall.
He caught him with a beautiful left hook

2625
01:59:18,231 --> 01:59:20,690
and heard them and it was just crazy 
fight.

2626
01:59:21,290 --> 01:59:22,123
And then he came back from that sort of 
employ the same strategy against 

2627
01:59:24,711 --> 01:59:25,521
whitaker.
But what did your,

2628
01:59:25,521 --> 01:59:27,080
kept it together?
Kept together?

2629
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:28,310
God,
he ate a lot of shots,

2630
01:59:28,311 --> 01:59:29,210
kept moving,
no,

2631
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:30,133
kept his hands up,
kept his composure and then finally 

2632
01:59:31,791 --> 01:59:33,680
found an opening him boom.

2633
01:59:34,010 --> 01:59:34,843
Dropped one on Brunson and then had 
Brunson crazy hurt and then moved in on 

2634
01:59:37,461 --> 01:59:38,960
him.
So it was an awesome,

2635
01:59:39,410 --> 01:59:40,243
it was an awesome exhibition for Wediko 
show that whitaker could overcome the 

2636
01:59:43,281 --> 01:59:44,114
storm of like a super confident and 
really dangerous guy who hits fucking 

2637
01:59:47,571 --> 01:59:49,790
hard,
who's had a lot of confidence because of

2638
01:59:49,791 --> 01:59:52,400
his most recent success doing that.
I mean,

2639
01:59:52,430 --> 01:59:54,680
Bronson came after him,
really,

2640
01:59:54,681 --> 01:59:56,390
really came after him.
Super aggressive,

2641
01:59:56,420 --> 02:00:00,350
maybe too aggressive for sure.
And now in hindsight you could say that,

2642
02:00:00,351 --> 02:00:03,770
but a lot of people other than whitaker 
probably would a wilted to that storm.

2643
02:00:03,870 --> 02:00:04,703
So it's interesting.
It was a really stern test for whitaker 

2644
02:00:06,981 --> 02:00:09,500
and showed you how strong he is.
Yeah.

2645
02:00:09,650 --> 02:00:12,110
It was one of the,
one of the beautiful aspects of watching

2646
02:00:12,111 --> 02:00:12,944
these different,
this chess play out with the whole body 

2647
02:00:14,991 --> 02:00:16,520
being utilized.
You know,

2648
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:18,650
you're never going to beat it for its 
excitement level.

2649
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:19,420
No.
Yeah.

2650
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:20,570
You have to realize

2651
02:00:20,670 --> 02:00:22,680
while you're watching it that liked 
life,

2652
02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:25,260
nobody gets out for free.
Yeah.

2653
02:00:25,290 --> 02:00:26,160
Like life.
I mean,

2654
02:00:26,161 --> 02:00:31,161
it's almost a microcosm of life.
It's crazy struggle and it,

2655
02:00:32,370 --> 02:00:33,203
you know,
it doesn't always end your way is this 

2656
02:00:34,910 --> 02:00:35,743
is what competition is in mixed martial 
arts is the most extreme version of 

2657
02:00:40,081 --> 02:00:41,970
problem solving.
We have outside of war,

2658
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:45,690
some most extreme with dire physical 
consequences.

2659
02:00:45,691 --> 02:00:48,450
You get brains like we saw Pat Barry get
k out there,

2660
02:00:48,630 --> 02:00:50,640
you know what I mean?
That's the consequences of this game.

2661
02:00:51,090 --> 02:00:51,923
But the,
the,

2662
02:00:52,020 --> 02:00:54,560
the,
the reality or the,

2663
02:00:54,570 --> 02:00:55,403
the,
the take is nobody gets out anyway 

2664
02:00:57,751 --> 02:00:58,584
alive.
Yeah.

2665
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:01,470
You can,
if you choose to experience this,

2666
02:01:01,471 --> 02:01:03,750
this extremely high level,
very short bursts,

2667
02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:06,360
understand how much resources you're 
burning off,

2668
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:09,280
understand what you're doing and you 
know,

2669
02:01:09,330 --> 02:01:10,163
proceed wisely.

2670
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:10,980
And when,
uh,

2671
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:12,490
when I talked to fighters who,
you know,

2672
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:14,130
sometimes question like,
man,

2673
02:01:14,131 --> 02:01:16,290
what am I doing it myself?
I'm just beating people up.

2674
02:01:16,291 --> 02:01:17,970
And that's what I do,
you know,

2675
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:19,073
to remind like remind them that what 
really is happening is two people are 

2676
02:01:22,711 --> 02:01:26,580
coming to an agreement to provide a form
of resistance for each other.

2677
02:01:26,610 --> 02:01:27,443
Like at the highest level of what this 
is like you're going to come face to 

2678
02:01:30,781 --> 02:01:31,614
face with someone who's also training 
and also striving to do everything that 

2679
02:01:34,711 --> 02:01:35,544
you're trying to do,
which is what's going to push you up 

2680
02:01:37,201 --> 02:01:39,860
against that form of resistance and give
an opportunity

2681
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:43,220
not only to overcome physically,
but overcome emotionally,

2682
02:01:43,221 --> 02:01:44,300
spiritually,
psychically,

2683
02:01:44,301 --> 02:01:45,540
everything.
You know,

2684
02:01:45,541 --> 02:01:48,710
you'll have to bring everything to bear 
against that form of resistance,

2685
02:01:48,711 --> 02:01:52,220
whether it's the weight cut or the 
opponent or the training or everything.

2686
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:54,220
And there's something to be said for 
that.

2687
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:55,533
The,
obviously the only issue for a lot of 

2688
02:01:57,351 --> 02:01:59,960
people is that you end up paying that 
price,

2689
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:02,990
not only then,
but later if you get the brain damage,

2690
02:02:02,991 --> 02:02:03,824
you know,
and that's,

2691
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:05,930
that's the only bummer of it and 
something that,

2692
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:07,370
um,
to be considered,

2693
02:02:07,371 --> 02:02:11,210
but as if it wasn't for that man.
What a fucking beautiful way to do it.

2694
02:02:11,211 --> 02:02:14,930
Like to get everything,
everything all together,

2695
02:02:14,931 --> 02:02:17,960
unified in one and provide that ultimate
form of resistance.

2696
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:19,273
It's like unbeatable.
It was definitely the most difficult 

2697
02:02:21,261 --> 02:02:23,750
physical challenge that we know of 
because you're competing,

2698
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:24,643
especially at the highest level,
you're competing with someone who's the 

2699
02:02:26,721 --> 02:02:31,721
same size as you,
has a commensurate level of expertise as

2700
02:02:31,881 --> 02:02:35,390
you and is as motivated as you are to 
win,

2701
02:02:36,740 --> 02:02:37,573
and you're in this crazy competition 
together where you're literally playing 

2702
02:02:40,731 --> 02:02:44,660
a game of press the button and then who 
you know who's who can shut off,

2703
02:02:44,661 --> 02:02:46,280
who's central nervous system quicker.

2704
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:52,030
What I'm fucking crazy game you.
You,

2705
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:55,820
you're never going to duplicate the 
excitement of that with any other sport.

2706
02:02:56,150 --> 02:02:58,340
You come close.
Like I guess football is probably pretty

2707
02:02:58,341 --> 02:02:59,174
close for people.
Boxing's probably a right up there in 

2708
02:03:02,151 --> 02:03:03,290
moments,
you know,

2709
02:03:03,291 --> 02:03:05,990
like when one men wall Ma,
let me say that again.

2710
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:09,080
One man,
well Marquez knocked out Pacquiao.

2711
02:03:09,230 --> 02:03:10,063
He hit him with that beautiful clean,
straight punch and just flat and 

2712
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:15,070
Pacquiao.
That was about as dramatic a moment that

2713
02:03:15,071 --> 02:03:18,470
you get in any sort of combat sports.
You see a superhero like pack.

2714
02:03:18,471 --> 02:03:20,180
Yeah,
get leveled with one shot.

2715
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:21,410
I'm like,
Whoa,

2716
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:22,273
but that woe is just so much more 
prevalent and mixed martial arts that 

2717
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:29,150
whoa happens so much more often.
It's a totally different thing.

2718
02:03:29,210 --> 02:03:32,000
And I think the,
the more rules that you put in,

2719
02:03:32,090 --> 02:03:32,923
in,
in front of that kind of primal 

2720
02:03:34,611 --> 02:03:35,720
conflict,
you know,

2721
02:03:35,721 --> 02:03:37,540
the,
the little bit more,

2722
02:03:37,890 --> 02:03:39,180
it kind of separates it.

2723
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:40,340
It makes it a sport.
You know,

2724
02:03:40,341 --> 02:03:41,174
like when you see boxers kind of 
grabbing each other and doing nothing 

2725
02:03:43,551 --> 02:03:44,750
about it,
you know,

2726
02:03:44,751 --> 02:03:46,640
that's when that moment of like,
oh yeah,

2727
02:03:46,641 --> 02:03:47,720
this is a sport.
Right.

2728
02:03:47,870 --> 02:03:50,450
Whereas in MMA,
there's fewer of those moments where you

2729
02:03:50,451 --> 02:03:51,650
go like,
oh yeah,

2730
02:03:51,651 --> 02:03:52,484
this is a sport.
It really just feels like people 

2731
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:55,890
fighting to the death.
Yeah.

2732
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:58,280
They're the only moments where you go to
sports.

2733
02:03:58,281 --> 02:03:59,570
Like,
you can't grab the fence,

2734
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:02,240
or I am punched the balls,
or Oh,

2735
02:04:02,241 --> 02:04:04,030
he pumped it high timeout.
Yeah.

2736
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:06,770
Yeah.
There's moments in boxing where you go,

2737
02:04:06,771 --> 02:04:07,880
well,
this is kind of silly.

2738
02:04:08,150 --> 02:04:09,950
You know,
how come you can just hang on like this?

2739
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:11,750
How come that guy can't trip you and 
take you down?

2740
02:04:11,751 --> 02:04:13,690
How come he can't kick your legs?
Right.

2741
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:14,533
You know,
it's really hard for me to watch boxing 

2742
02:04:15,891 --> 02:04:19,070
sometimes and not think about kicking 
someone's legs like,

2743
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:20,750
or someone kicking someone's legs 
rather.

2744
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:22,160
Not that I'm running around,
man.

2745
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,700
I mean,
I'm see the way they're standing and I'm

2746
02:04:25,701 --> 02:04:25,971
like,
yeah,

2747
02:04:25,971 --> 02:04:28,850
well there's those little thoughts like 
this is effective.

2748
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:31,100
As long as someone's not kicking your 
legs.

2749
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:31,641
Yeah,
we know.

2750
02:04:31,641 --> 02:04:33,860
But if you're fighting the same fight,
but you're,

2751
02:04:33,861 --> 02:04:34,694
you know,
you're fighting someone like Joe 

2752
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,033
Schilling,
it's going to be fucking kicking the 

2753
02:04:37,441 --> 02:04:38,010
shit out of your

2754
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:38,820
legs.
Yeah.

2755
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:39,653
You know,
it's a totally different experience and 

2756
02:04:40,471 --> 02:04:41,304
he's a long dudes.
She's going to be standing way on the 

2757
02:04:42,541 --> 02:04:45,030
outside and if you don't know how to 
deal with that,

2758
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:48,420
you're only going to be able to absorb a
few of those before you're useless.

2759
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:49,303
Yeah.
Or you think of like Badr Hari's like 

2760
02:04:50,671 --> 02:04:52,650
leaping overhand,
right.

2761
02:04:52,700 --> 02:04:53,533
Where he commits everything,
all of his childhood pain and to that 

2762
02:04:56,670 --> 02:04:57,510
right hand,
right.

2763
02:04:57,780 --> 02:04:58,613
You can't do that all the time.
And mma because someone would just duck 

2764
02:05:01,381 --> 02:05:04,860
underneath it in double leg,
but he's never had to worry about that.

2765
02:05:04,861 --> 02:05:06,540
So you know,
it's still still,

2766
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:07,374
he's one of the most exciting 
motherfuckers ever and he's fighting 

2767
02:05:08,611 --> 02:05:11,090
against soon.
He's fighting Rico Verhoeven going to be

2768
02:05:11,091 --> 02:05:12,580
on December 10th.
Yeah,

2769
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:15,240
that's a crazy night.
There's a gang of fights that night,

2770
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:17,740
that same night.
Bernard Ha.

2771
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:18,120
No,
no.

2772
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:20,790
Bernard Hopkins is the 17th he's making 
his final fight.

2773
02:05:21,270 --> 02:05:23,240
But uh,
that same night is a,

2774
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:24,083
the UFC from Toronto.
It's glory and there's something else 

2775
02:05:27,571 --> 02:05:30,120
going on that night too.
There's some sort of a boxing fight that

2776
02:05:30,121 --> 02:05:31,590
night as well.
It does it,

2777
02:05:31,591 --> 02:05:33,470
but it's a crazy night.
That's a,

2778
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:34,890
it's a weird fight,
man.

2779
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:37,070
Verhoeven and bought her Harry Potter 
hard.

2780
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:41,330
He's a scary dude literally and many,
many,

2781
02:05:41,340 --> 02:05:42,780
many ways.
It's so fun to watch.

2782
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:45,780
He's just one of my favorites ever cause
she's like you said,

2783
02:05:45,781 --> 02:05:46,614
he just commits commencing this 
extremely violent way and sometimes he 

2784
02:05:49,921 --> 02:05:51,330
gets carried out on the shield.
You know,

2785
02:05:51,610 --> 02:05:52,980
he,
sometimes he had goes down.

2786
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:56,210
Really can't shut that off.
Like once he gets that thing going,

2787
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:57,053
I mean he would want to stomp his bone 
and after they're down and he's just a 

2788
02:05:59,911 --> 02:06:01,070
fucking savage.
Yeah,

2789
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:05,700
he's definitely,
I would love to see there a laundry list

2790
02:06:05,701 --> 02:06:09,090
of Mexican supplements.
I'm like,

2791
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:11,350
what kind of cocktail you guys run in 
here?

2792
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:14,790
He definitely has hair braided around 
his dick,

2793
02:06:14,791 --> 02:06:16,890
like Princess Leia.
So big.

2794
02:06:16,891 --> 02:06:17,730
Now.
Have you seen him?

2795
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:18,593
You've seen the most recent photos of 
bought her pull up the recent photos of 

2796
02:06:21,061 --> 02:06:21,894
bought her hard cause he puts some 
photos on instagram of him training and 

2797
02:06:24,211 --> 02:06:25,700
you know,
took pictures of him with his shirt off.

2798
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:28,590
He like what?
Jesus Christ.

2799
02:06:28,591 --> 02:06:30,030
He looks,
he's about to 50 now,

2800
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:31,830
something like that.
And he's a big giant dude.

2801
02:06:31,831 --> 02:06:33,960
He's always been a big giant dude,
but he's like super,

2802
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:37,080
super muscled out.
Now look at this shit.

2803
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:42,860
He's fucking,
he's fucking jacked.

2804
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:43,993
But there's uh,
there's some other photos or maybe a 

2805
02:06:45,601 --> 02:06:47,970
little bit clear if you go there.
It is right there.

2806
02:06:47,971 --> 02:06:51,300
That one in the middle.
What in the fuck is going on there?

2807
02:06:51,930 --> 02:06:54,990
That dude's gigantic now.
Yeah,

2808
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:57,990
I mean that's terrifying.
That's gigantic.

2809
02:06:58,650 --> 02:07:01,170
He's so much bigger than he was when he 
first started.

2810
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:03,630
When he first started kickboxing,
he was this long,

2811
02:07:03,631 --> 02:07:04,830
tall,
thin guy.

2812
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:05,813
Cause he started like some of his early 
fights that I've seen during the k one 

2813
02:07:10,141 --> 02:07:10,974
days.
Even he was way skinnier like back in 

2814
02:07:12,811 --> 02:07:13,644
the day and then kicked out like put up.
You want to see something put Badr Hari 

2815
02:07:18,541 --> 02:07:21,270
versus Stefan Leco.
Um,

2816
02:07:21,330 --> 02:07:25,470
and that was just typing Leco yeah,
there it is.

2817
02:07:25,471 --> 02:07:26,304
Stefan [inaudible] and this is Badr Hari
look at like what he looked like back 

2818
02:07:29,191 --> 02:07:30,870
then.
Upper left upper left image.

2819
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:31,830
Yeah.
That's Badr Hari.

2820
02:07:31,831 --> 02:07:33,820
Then look at the difference.
Yeah.

2821
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:35,770
Crazy.
He hits stuff on,

2822
02:07:35,810 --> 02:07:38,230
go with a spinning back kick to the face
and flatten them.

2823
02:07:38,430 --> 02:07:42,070
They had fought previously and Leco 
stopped him with a spinning back kick to

2824
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:43,740
the body.
So a,

2825
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:44,730
in the rematch,
she,

2826
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:48,280
he hit him with one of the face.
Crazy but look,

2827
02:07:48,281 --> 02:07:49,540
great picture.
Yeah.

2828
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:50,760
Beautiful.
You could see that.

2829
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:52,830
Find the video.
Find the video.

2830
02:07:52,860 --> 02:07:53,780
Potter,
Hari Kao,

2831
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:55,950
Stefan Leco.
Um,

2832
02:07:57,220 --> 02:07:58,053
there it is.

2833
02:07:59,080 --> 02:07:59,470
Okay.

2834
02:07:59,470 --> 02:08:00,303
You got to think that this,
this dude's probably put on like 50 

2835
02:08:02,801 --> 02:08:03,700
pounds or something.

2836
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:06,210
Yeah.
Is this,

2837
02:08:06,210 --> 02:08:07,930
this is Leco.
Oh,

2838
02:08:07,931 --> 02:08:10,990
this is Dubai.
2014 I think this is the other one.

2839
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:12,430
This is,
that was a,

2840
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:13,773
yeah,
that's it.

2841
02:08:13,810 --> 02:08:15,400
You just had it right there.
This is it.

2842
02:08:15,460 --> 02:08:17,770
Here it comes.
He throws one in messes.

2843
02:08:17,771 --> 02:08:19,240
But look how skinny he is here,
man.

2844
02:08:19,270 --> 02:08:20,500
Yeah.
Total different guy.

2845
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:21,400
Different selves.
Yeah.

2846
02:08:21,401 --> 02:08:22,320
Here it goes.
Watch it.

2847
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:24,100
He set it up,
set it up with a jab.

2848
02:08:24,220 --> 02:08:26,800
He faked it to the body.
That bomb goes up top.

2849
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:30,850
Damn flatline.
Nothing quite like a,

2850
02:08:30,910 --> 02:08:32,710
like that Barbosa kick.
Yeah.

2851
02:08:33,230 --> 02:08:35,140
Well that was almost a different one 
though,

2852
02:08:35,141 --> 02:08:36,940
that he did it.
A side kick to the face.

2853
02:08:37,450 --> 02:08:39,850
It was a,
he didn't do it as like a wheel kick.

2854
02:08:39,851 --> 02:08:42,040
If you watch it again,
rewind a little bit.

2855
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:44,770
He shot it as a straight kick.
Rewind it.

2856
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:46,740
Uh,
he,

2857
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:49,660
he threw it as if you see how he's 
throwing it there.

2858
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:50,493
He threw it to the body.
That's a spinning sidekick or turning 

2859
02:08:52,571 --> 02:08:55,390
sidekick.
He's not doing it as a back kick.

2860
02:08:55,391 --> 02:08:57,670
If you did the toes to be down,
but see how he went up there.

2861
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:00,280
That was just a turning side kick to the
face.

2862
02:09:00,730 --> 02:09:01,563
It's kind of halfway between,
both halfway between a wheel kick and a 

2863
02:09:04,031 --> 02:09:05,950
spinning back kick or a turning 
sidekick.

2864
02:09:06,420 --> 02:09:08,200
But it was fucking beautiful.
Boom.

2865
02:09:08,850 --> 02:09:10,480
Look smaller wheel kick when I look at 
it there.

2866
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:15,900
But Jesus Christ the perfect Yup.
Right on the blocks and Stefan Leco uh,

2867
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:19,570
who was uh,
he was a great fight or two man.

2868
02:09:19,571 --> 02:09:20,404
That guy.
Yeah,

2869
02:09:20,410 --> 02:09:21,243
he knocked a lot of dudes out,
saw him knock out Peter Earths in Vegas 

2870
02:09:24,130 --> 02:09:27,580
One k one was just starting to come up.
They were do it putting on some shows in

2871
02:09:27,581 --> 02:09:31,180
Vegas this before the UFC was big.
They thought that k one was,

2872
02:09:31,210 --> 02:09:35,050
would I think really still think it 
could have if it was promoted properly,

2873
02:09:35,230 --> 02:09:37,150
could have like gotten a grip in North 
America.

2874
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:39,480
Well that's what,
you know,

2875
02:09:39,550 --> 02:09:42,790
Gloria is pushing that boulder now.
Gloria is a good example.

2876
02:09:42,791 --> 02:09:46,300
And so as lion fight,
I prefer the rules of lion fight though.

2877
02:09:46,630 --> 02:09:48,790
Cause lion fight is full.
Moitai yeah,

2878
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:49,773
elbows.
We went to one of those [inaudible] 

2879
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:51,611
Vegas.
Yeah.

2880
02:09:51,611 --> 02:09:53,650
That's one of the few things that I go 
to see live.

2881
02:09:53,950 --> 02:09:55,700
I still like to go see live.
Yeah.

2882
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:59,140
Fuck man.
A high level Moitai in America.

2883
02:09:59,170 --> 02:10:03,100
It's like the level of the fights is 
very high.

2884
02:10:03,250 --> 02:10:05,920
It's just people aren't just,
didn't totally not aware of it yet.

2885
02:10:06,970 --> 02:10:09,790
They need to be though.
It's crazy exciting.

2886
02:10:10,910 --> 02:10:12,760
It's just,
and there's so much talent.

2887
02:10:12,970 --> 02:10:16,360
It's not like this is an exciting thing,
but only like five guys are good at it.

2888
02:10:16,630 --> 02:10:19,030
It's an exciting thing where,
especially in the lighter weights,

2889
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:22,690
like Thailand's full of fucking killers,
they got a ton of them in Europe.

2890
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:23,553
They've got them all over the globe.
There's so many good Moy Thai fighters 

2891
02:10:26,291 --> 02:10:27,100
out there.
They just,

2892
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:29,980
for whatever reason,
we haven't caught on yet.

2893
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:32,200
That's why I think when I think about 
this time,

2894
02:10:32,201 --> 02:10:34,070
I think it's the best time ever because

2895
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:36,920
we get to see all of these incredible 
contest,

2896
02:10:36,921 --> 02:10:37,754
still extremely physical,
like we're still at the rising peak of 

2897
02:10:40,611 --> 02:10:41,444
our physical prowess,
but we're also at the peak of our 

2898
02:10:43,581 --> 02:10:44,414
technological prowess and the peak of 
our ability to access all of the best 

2899
02:10:47,901 --> 02:10:48,734
foods and access the best ideas and all 
of the different things that can shape 

2900
02:10:52,611 --> 02:10:57,611
us like as pessimistic as people get it 
is for sure the best of times right now.

2901
02:10:58,071 --> 02:11:00,110
You know,
for the majority of people now obviously

2902
02:11:00,111 --> 02:11:03,290
they're hell's on the planet still.
There's hell's that we can put ourselves

2903
02:11:03,291 --> 02:11:04,580
in.
There's suffering,

2904
02:11:04,581 --> 02:11:07,970
but overall on the macro level,
it's a fucking,

2905
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:09,750
it's the golden age now.
Sure.

2906
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:11,660
Anybody argues with that?
It's an asshole.

2907
02:11:11,750 --> 02:11:12,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

2908
02:11:12,771 --> 02:11:13,604
I want to go back to a time where you 
had to speak with grunt and even in the 

2909
02:11:16,011 --> 02:11:18,680
future,
like I can't imagine that the,

2910
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:24,260
I guess maybe maybe it would like maybe 
we've just seen too many gray aliens,

2911
02:11:24,261 --> 02:11:25,094
you know,
where the body kind of becomes less and 

2912
02:11:26,271 --> 02:11:29,240
less important and everything is focused
on the consciousness.

2913
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:33,020
I feel like you get to that level and 
you fucking miss this,

2914
02:11:33,110 --> 02:11:34,730
this certain,
you know,

2915
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:39,440
evolution and epoch for the pleasure 
monkey where we had all of that physical

2916
02:11:39,441 --> 02:11:44,270
access to strive and train and,
and feel all the physical things as well

2917
02:11:44,271 --> 02:11:45,140
as,
you know,

2918
02:11:45,141 --> 02:11:45,974
reach incredible heights in,
in consciousness and meditation and you 

2919
02:11:49,251 --> 02:11:51,080
know,
community and these,

2920
02:11:51,310 --> 02:11:52,400
these great things.
I think,

2921
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:53,713
you know,
I think really no matter what stage 

2922
02:11:55,641 --> 02:11:58,070
before or after,
I think we'll look back at this one.

2923
02:11:58,071 --> 02:12:00,080
Like this was a special fucking time.

2924
02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:01,123
It's definitely a special time,
but I think every time it's a special 

2925
02:12:03,051 --> 02:12:03,884
time because every time,
no matter where you are and the 

2926
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:07,490
timescale,
if you're in that moment,

2927
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:08,353
you're in the most present time,
you're in the most current time and I 

2928
02:12:11,211 --> 02:12:12,044
guarantee you at every step of the way,
people were logging with nostalgia for 

2929
02:12:15,411 --> 02:12:16,580
the past.
I bet they were like,

2930
02:12:16,581 --> 02:12:17,414
God damn man,
who used to rape is run across the 

2931
02:12:19,701 --> 02:12:21,500
village.
Chop heads off and shit.

2932
02:12:21,540 --> 02:12:22,490
Good old days,
Bro.

2933
02:12:22,710 --> 02:12:23,543
Yeah,
good times before they started writing 

2934
02:12:24,231 --> 02:12:25,064
things down on paper is probably a lot 
of people that miss that they miss to 

2935
02:12:30,301 --> 02:12:31,134
shooting arrows.
Just launched them in the air and 

2936
02:12:32,571 --> 02:12:34,130
whatever's over there.
Fuck them.

2937
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:38,420
They did.
They made it rain arrows from the sky

2938
02:12:38,530 --> 02:12:42,790
and like 50 years after that was over,
some viking king had a slogan,

2939
02:12:42,791 --> 02:12:43,680
let Denmark race

2940
02:12:43,810 --> 02:12:45,800
again.
Everybody was excited.

2941
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:50,030
Not Denmark rape again.
We let the killings begin a new,

2942
02:12:50,510 --> 02:12:53,910
but that was a big problem with Japan's.
If he didn't want to embrace the gun was

2943
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:54,261
like,
no,

2944
02:12:54,261 --> 02:12:57,080
you pussies can't be fucking shooting 
people with guns.

2945
02:12:57,260 --> 02:13:00,050
That's such a bitch ass way to go.
You got to use solar.

2946
02:13:00,051 --> 02:13:01,640
It's come on,
come on,

2947
02:13:01,641 --> 02:13:03,560
don't be a bitch.
But they,

2948
02:13:03,590 --> 02:13:05,270
they,
they've held on too long.

2949
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:08,120
They didn't embrace the gun.
They need to get on that right away.

2950
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:11,170
If they had the Japanese engineering 
that you see today in Lexus,

2951
02:13:11,370 --> 02:13:13,850
if they had applied that to guns back in
the day,

2952
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:16,920
had same knowhow and discipline,
they have the best gun stayed,

2953
02:13:16,921 --> 02:13:17,560
not the best gun,

2954
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:18,393
but you dedicate yourself and become 
masters in the world at swordsmanship 

2955
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:22,950
and then the gun comes along,
right.

2956
02:13:23,290 --> 02:13:25,390
Ah,
fuck this.

2957
02:13:25,391 --> 02:13:28,890
Fuck.
This trumps all of my years of work.

2958
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:30,480
But the sword.
Yeah.

2959
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:32,310
Yeah man,
they made it easy.

2960
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:33,203
I mean,
it's sort of like a supermarket did for 

2961
02:13:35,490 --> 02:13:40,230
versus being a substance,
a living off the land type person.

2962
02:13:40,630 --> 02:13:41,463
You know,
if you've watched those shows from a 

2963
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:43,583
Alaska where the people are all living 
in and grow their own vegetables and 

2964
02:13:45,991 --> 02:13:49,620
shit and they catch fish in the river,
there's something romantic about it.

2965
02:13:49,621 --> 02:13:51,840
Write something that drags.
I love those shows,

2966
02:13:51,841 --> 02:13:52,680
man.
I watch those shows.

2967
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:54,273
You know,
you like,

2968
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:55,880
you know,
your purpose every day.

2969
02:13:55,881 --> 02:13:57,350
And I think when people know their 
purpose,

2970
02:13:57,351 --> 02:13:59,330
my purpose is to survive,
get food,

2971
02:13:59,331 --> 02:14:00,650
stay warm,
you know,

2972
02:14:01,030 --> 02:14:02,030
uh,
make babies.

2973
02:14:02,060 --> 02:14:04,940
Like it's really comforting to know what
your purpose is.

2974
02:14:05,170 --> 02:14:05,631
Well,
yeah.

2975
02:14:05,631 --> 02:14:06,464
And especially if you don't have any 
internet like before they got on 

2976
02:14:08,181 --> 02:14:09,014
television,
I wonder how much access to Internet 

2977
02:14:10,070 --> 02:14:10,940
even had up there.

2978
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:12,053
Ma,
why watch this one family that 

2979
02:14:12,821 --> 02:14:14,590
apparently,
you know that uh,

2980
02:14:14,620 --> 02:14:17,380
that singer jewel,
do you know who she is?

2981
02:14:17,590 --> 02:14:18,423
She has a one snaggletooth but she's 
very beautiful and people like the fact 

2982
02:14:21,041 --> 02:14:23,950
that she doesn't fix her teeth because 
she's imperfect yet.

2983
02:14:23,951 --> 02:14:25,040
Perfect.
Um,

2984
02:14:25,150 --> 02:14:29,050
she's apparently from this one family 
that has this,

2985
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:32,470
this show,
goddammit Alaska,

2986
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:34,990
the final frontier.
Is that the name of it?

2987
02:14:35,410 --> 02:14:36,250
Uh,
but anyway,

2988
02:14:36,251 --> 02:14:37,950
it's her relatives.
Yeah,

2989
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:40,900
I think,
I feel like close relatives that live up

2990
02:14:40,901 --> 02:14:44,890
there in this crazy way and it's a,
you know,

2991
02:14:44,891 --> 02:14:49,891
real simple like some of them farm and 
they raised cattle and they have to like

2992
02:14:50,170 --> 02:14:51,003
move their cattle across this area to 
take them to where they graze and they 

2993
02:14:54,911 --> 02:14:55,744
drop them off.
And they have to move them back at the 

2994
02:14:57,430 --> 02:14:58,630
end of the year.
It's nuts.

2995
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:00,310
And so while they're up there doing 
this,

2996
02:15:00,820 --> 02:15:03,490
grizzly bears just start ripping their 
fucking cows apart.

2997
02:15:03,490 --> 02:15:05,650
So now they have to go and deal with 
these,

2998
02:15:05,890 --> 02:15:06,723
you know,
11 foot tall giant dog things that need 

2999
02:15:11,291 --> 02:15:12,124
food constantly to consume.
And on one hand you can't blame them 

3000
02:15:14,650 --> 02:15:18,160
like these fat stupid cows just 
wandering around over by the grass.

3001
02:15:18,310 --> 02:15:21,310
All they have to do is go by the grass.
There's fucking hundreds of them.

3002
02:15:21,430 --> 02:15:24,580
Where else are they going to find 
hundreds of things that they can eat?

3003
02:15:24,850 --> 02:15:25,683
Nowhere.
Like you just put out a buffet in front 

3004
02:15:28,121 --> 02:15:29,950
of the Grizzly bear and you're mad at 
their eating.

3005
02:15:30,310 --> 02:15:31,930
It's bare supermarket.
So they had a,

3006
02:15:31,960 --> 02:15:32,793
he had a hunt them down.
It's crazy watching this guy because 

3007
02:15:35,350 --> 02:15:39,280
although it is reality TV and you do not
know how much of this show is,

3008
02:15:39,281 --> 02:15:41,980
bullshit goes clearly,
some of it's bullshit.

3009
02:15:42,070 --> 02:15:42,903
There's clearly some setup.
Like I saw one scene where they had a 

3010
02:15:45,851 --> 02:15:46,684
filleted salmon and the bear was 
supposedly getting fish from the river 

3011
02:15:50,410 --> 02:15:52,330
and it was coming too close to them 
while they're fishing.

3012
02:15:52,331 --> 02:15:54,010
But you never saw the two of them,
the same frame.

3013
02:15:54,250 --> 02:15:55,083
And then you see the bear and the bear 
has a salmon that's filleted meaning 

3014
02:15:58,421 --> 02:15:59,254
like someone cut that Sam and threw it 
in the water and gave it to the fucking 

3015
02:16:01,631 --> 02:16:03,100
bear,
which is like,

3016
02:16:03,101 --> 02:16:04,540
come on stupid.
You know.

3017
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:07,690
So you guys are the only people here,
but yet the bear,

3018
02:16:07,691 --> 02:16:08,524
you haven't caught a fish yet,
but the bear is a fish that has filets 

3019
02:16:10,601 --> 02:16:13,360
removed off of it.
Shut the fuck up man.

3020
02:16:13,361 --> 02:16:14,194
I'm not stupid.

3021
02:16:15,250 --> 02:16:16,180
Yeah,
that's the,

3022
02:16:16,181 --> 02:16:17,014
that's the TV game.
But it does give you like a little 

3023
02:16:18,731 --> 02:16:22,030
window into the wild ways that all of us
humans live.

3024
02:16:22,090 --> 02:16:23,800
It gives a window,
which is cool.

3025
02:16:23,801 --> 02:16:24,634
Like I got to um,
there's this book before they pass away 

3026
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:30,250
and you gave me that book.

3027
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:30,911
Give me that.
But yeah,

3028
02:16:30,911 --> 02:16:33,370
it looks amazing.
It's amazing photos.

3029
02:16:33,371 --> 02:16:35,590
But then you start reading about these 
different cultures,

3030
02:16:35,591 --> 02:16:38,870
like actually had the photographer on my
podcast and he was telling me about,

3031
02:16:39,370 --> 02:16:40,900
um,
what is his name?

3032
02:16:40,901 --> 02:16:42,520
It's called before they,
pat Jimmy Nelson,

3033
02:16:42,700 --> 02:16:43,630
Jimmy,
Jimmy Nelson.

3034
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:45,880
So Jimmy Nelson was on the podcast and 
uh,

3035
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:46,833
he was talking about the Himba people,
which have these amazing photos or like 

3036
02:16:48,881 --> 02:16:51,280
a really tall tribe.
And I believe it was the Himba.

3037
02:16:51,730 --> 02:16:54,520
And um,
he was telling me about their custom,

3038
02:16:54,610 --> 02:16:56,890
they live in just such a dramatically 
different way.

3039
02:16:56,891 --> 02:16:59,890
So they're,
they're like a pastoral shepherding kind

3040
02:16:59,891 --> 02:17:01,780
of tribes.
So they have all of their cows,

3041
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:02,793
but there's very little grass.
So the men have to take the cows on 

3042
02:17:05,591 --> 02:17:09,100
these long walks to feed them like four 
weeks away.

3043
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:10,233
Right.
But what they do is they leave one man 

3044
02:17:12,881 --> 02:17:15,100
behind in the,
in the village,

3045
02:17:15,130 --> 02:17:17,920
and it's his job to sexually satisfy all
the women,

3046
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:19,500
all,
well,

3047
02:17:19,501 --> 02:17:22,390
all the men are gone.
And that position rotates,

3048
02:17:22,660 --> 02:17:25,690
right?
So that everybody gets their turn as the

3049
02:17:25,691 --> 02:17:28,720
one dude that gets to sexually satisfy 
the entire village.

3050
02:17:28,750 --> 02:17:31,620
One of girls get pissed if it's all this
motherfucker turn.

3051
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:33,030
Yeah.
Hate is dirty.

3052
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:37,180
Dig to watch this little tiny dirty 
dance.

3053
02:17:37,670 --> 02:17:41,440
There's certain guys that they're never,
they're never on vacation for when it's,

3054
02:17:41,441 --> 02:17:43,750
that guy's turning around.
Some girls will hold out,

3055
02:17:43,790 --> 02:17:45,820
but like I'm good,
I'm good.

3056
02:17:45,821 --> 02:17:47,560
You can go fuck my friends.
I'm gonna wait,

3057
02:17:47,890 --> 02:17:51,400
I'm gonna wait until Igor is term.
Igor slangs that good deck.

3058
02:17:56,350 --> 02:17:57,730
No,
I wouldn't want that.

3059
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:00,440
I only want her pleasure to come from my
penis.

3060
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:03,760
Penis.
I heard of the massage man.

3061
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:06,430
The way he touched her anus come so 
hard,

3062
02:18:07,140 --> 02:18:07,973
tim.
With all my being one day I will remove 

3063
02:18:10,421 --> 02:18:15,370
him from this life with a sword.
It's so funny that someone who you love,

3064
02:18:15,550 --> 02:18:16,383
someone else makes that person who you 
love gives them pleasure and interfaith 

3065
02:18:19,870 --> 02:18:23,800
their ass.
She's got her ass up in the air.

3066
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:26,190
She's backing up into his tongue.
Ah,

3067
02:18:26,680 --> 02:18:28,170
nope,
nope,

3068
02:18:28,270 --> 02:18:29,051
no new,
new,

3069
02:18:29,051 --> 02:18:29,501
new,
new,

3070
02:18:29,501 --> 02:18:31,750
new.
That's the thing that makes you vomit as

3071
02:18:31,751 --> 02:18:34,510
a man because it triggers these,
these things.

3072
02:18:34,511 --> 02:18:37,990
But it can all be worked through.
Like you can push through the other side

3073
02:18:37,991 --> 02:18:39,160
and that's,
you know,

3074
02:18:39,190 --> 02:18:41,830
or you could shoot yourself or you 
could,

3075
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:43,173
I think we played that.
We played that country song where it's 

3076
02:18:44,801 --> 02:18:47,460
like I flashed my headlights that are 
window.

3077
02:18:47,830 --> 02:18:49,920
Yeah.
It all fucking crazy in your head about,

3078
02:18:49,930 --> 02:18:50,980
or just be like,
oh,

3079
02:18:50,981 --> 02:18:53,470
the pleasure monkeys getting pleasure.
Great.

3080
02:18:53,560 --> 02:18:54,393
Yeah.
Well men who freak out about other like 

3081
02:18:57,311 --> 02:18:58,690
girl there,
girl liking another guy.

3082
02:18:58,691 --> 02:18:59,440
Like,
man,

3083
02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:02,080
you can't win that one.
You got to let it go.

3084
02:19:02,081 --> 02:19:04,030
Because here's the thing.
When someone likes someone,

3085
02:19:04,031 --> 02:19:06,440
they fucking like someone and you're 
going to accept,

3086
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:08,230
Ooh,
can't believe it's fucking cold.

3087
02:19:08,231 --> 02:19:09,400
I'm going to go for a walk.
Nuke it.

3088
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:10,930
Don't do it.
You're going to freeze to dead.

3089
02:19:11,050 --> 02:19:13,480
Fuck that.
I like walking naked.

3090
02:19:13,481 --> 02:19:15,910
I know you like walking naked,
but he can't go walking naked.

3091
02:19:15,911 --> 02:19:16,744
You're gonna fucking freeze to death is 
a reality of going outside when it's 30 

3092
02:19:18,881 --> 02:19:19,930
below zero.
Right.

3093
02:19:19,960 --> 02:19:22,280
Okay.
Well this is the same reality applies.

3094
02:19:22,281 --> 02:19:23,114
So when someone doesn't like you,
if a girl does not wanna have sex with 

3095
02:19:25,391 --> 02:19:26,710
you,
but she wants to fuck the rock,

3096
02:19:26,770 --> 02:19:27,980
there's not a lot you

3097
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:29,750
could say about it.
Okay?

3098
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,210
She's not,
you will,

3099
02:19:31,270 --> 02:19:33,070
you know the rock doesn't love you the 
way I love you.

3100
02:19:33,190 --> 02:19:36,410
I love you forever in eternity.
And it's not even like the body.

3101
02:19:36,411 --> 02:19:38,150
It's like the soul now.
It's not going to work.

3102
02:19:38,180 --> 02:19:41,750
She's thinking of the rocket has giant 
Samoan Dick just ramming it home.

3103
02:19:42,230 --> 02:19:44,180
That's what she wants.
Okay,

3104
02:19:44,210 --> 02:19:45,043
you got to accept that and you're going 
to have to enjoy another aspect of life 

3105
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:50,833
other than having sex with one person 
who's now having sex with a rock or be 

3106
02:19:53,181 --> 02:19:54,680
happy for her and be like,
man,

3107
02:19:54,710 --> 02:19:56,630
that's fucking awesome.
That's not going to happen once per,

3108
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:59,330
you know,
just exactly.

3109
02:19:59,331 --> 02:20:01,250
Look at that photo.
Is that when he's holding one of the,

3110
02:20:01,251 --> 02:20:01,740
uh,
he's,

3111
02:20:01,740 --> 02:20:05,300
he slings those fucking bigfoot's Bro.
Those primal bells that we have,

3112
02:20:05,690 --> 02:20:07,340
he slings that thing around like it's 
nothing.

3113
02:20:07,460 --> 02:20:09,440
Yeah.
That's an enormous human dude.

3114
02:20:09,470 --> 02:20:11,240
It's,
it's possible to make that move,

3115
02:20:11,241 --> 02:20:11,840
man.
I mean,

3116
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:14,180
I've been working on it in my own life.
It's fucking possible.

3117
02:20:14,181 --> 02:20:15,470
It's hard.
It's hard as fuck.

3118
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:16,333
But you know you can,
you can transcend these things were and 

3119
02:20:19,491 --> 02:20:21,740
just understand that deeper metaphysical
truth,

3120
02:20:21,741 --> 02:20:24,800
pleasure for someone I love.
Makes that person my friend,

3121
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:26,720
not my enemy.
Of course.

3122
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:29,960
In theory I believe you.
But for the sake of humor,

3123
02:20:30,290 --> 02:20:35,150
I'm going to keep talking shit about the
rock banging your sister areas.

3124
02:20:35,151 --> 02:20:37,130
He's got a gorilla there.
I can't believe he use two hands.

3125
02:20:37,131 --> 02:20:39,230
What a bitch.
I throw that around with one.

3126
02:20:39,930 --> 02:20:41,210
Yeah,
the rock.

3127
02:20:41,570 --> 02:20:43,430
It's a strong human man and you know 
what?

3128
02:20:43,431 --> 02:20:46,600
Just not just strong like physically but
strongly.

3129
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:49,430
His personality,
the way he projects himself.

3130
02:20:49,431 --> 02:20:50,264
Like he's a perfect example of someone 
who projects like this very positive 

3131
02:20:53,331 --> 02:20:54,620
vibe man.
He's like,

3132
02:20:54,621 --> 02:20:57,050
this is very energetic,
positive,

3133
02:20:57,051 --> 02:20:58,040
happy vibe.

3134
02:20:58,040 --> 02:21:01,220
It's very infectious.
Like I see that guy talking.

3135
02:21:01,221 --> 02:21:03,450
He does like youtube clips or instagram 
clips rather.

3136
02:21:03,451 --> 02:21:04,284
A little videos he makes and his,
his positivity and genuine enthusiasm 

3137
02:21:08,361 --> 02:21:13,130
and happiness is so infectious.
I'm a fucking fan boy of the rock.

3138
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:15,860
I said it.
I fucking said it.

3139
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:17,030
I don't care.
You know,

3140
02:21:17,031 --> 02:21:19,760
he's got a great bit Andrew Santina.
I don't,

3141
02:21:19,761 --> 02:21:22,160
I'm not going to give out a word of it.
Not a word.

3142
02:21:22,190 --> 02:21:23,360
I cannot,
I cannot even,

3143
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:24,433
but if you get a chance,
Andrew Santiago has a fucking hilarious 

3144
02:21:27,441 --> 02:21:29,450
bit about the rock.
God Damn,

3145
02:21:29,451 --> 02:21:31,010
it's good.
It's really funny.

3146
02:21:32,030 --> 02:21:34,430
But um,
that kind of person,

3147
02:21:34,431 --> 02:21:36,090
man,
like those are fuel,

3148
02:21:36,091 --> 02:21:36,501
those,
those are,

3149
02:21:36,501 --> 02:21:38,070
that's human fuels.
That guy's like a,

3150
02:21:38,071 --> 02:21:39,320
a light.
So like,

3151
02:21:39,380 --> 02:21:40,290
I mean,
I,

3152
02:21:40,291 --> 02:21:41,124
I've come to look at ourselves like a,
like a software operating system that 

3153
02:21:43,761 --> 02:21:44,594
can constantly get rewritten a little 
bit by even by the people that you're 

3154
02:21:46,911 --> 02:21:47,661
around,
you know,

3155
02:21:47,661 --> 02:21:48,494
whether it's,
you want to look from the point of like 

3156
02:21:49,671 --> 02:21:50,504
mirror neurons,
you actually experiencing the same 

3157
02:21:52,881 --> 02:21:55,090
emotional state that the person you're 
around and,

3158
02:21:55,100 --> 02:21:58,390
or if it's just ideas or thoughts or 
whatever you want to,

3159
02:21:58,430 --> 02:22:01,610
however you want to look at it,
it's like adding a little bit of code to

3160
02:22:01,611 --> 02:22:02,390
our code base.

3161
02:22:02,390 --> 02:22:04,760
And sometimes it's helpful and sometimes
it's a virus,

3162
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:08,210
but the more you surround yourself with 
people with that kind of positive vibe,

3163
02:22:08,211 --> 02:22:11,420
it's like building on the software in a 
positive way.

3164
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:13,730
When you're around these more negative 
people,

3165
02:22:13,731 --> 02:22:15,770
they're implanting different little,
you know,

3166
02:22:15,771 --> 02:22:19,280
bugs and viruses that you're going to 
have to scan and remove later.

3167
02:22:19,430 --> 02:22:21,350
Essentially all open source.
Exactly.

3168
02:22:21,410 --> 02:22:24,140
100% open source.
Some beings are open source but uh,

3169
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:25,980
you know,
mine your firewall.

3170
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:27,870
Totally,
totally.

3171
02:22:27,871 --> 02:22:28,704
Should I be careful?
Put yourself in situations where you're 

3172
02:22:30,751 --> 02:22:33,420
adding to that positive code base,
the books you're reading,

3173
02:22:33,421 --> 02:22:35,190
the things you're listening to,
you know,

3174
02:22:35,191 --> 02:22:36,024
and,
and be careful of the things on tv to 

3175
02:22:37,231 --> 02:22:38,890
that are adding to the,
you know,

3176
02:22:38,970 --> 02:22:39,803
creating more of the viruses.
Reince like supporting these negative 

3177
02:22:42,991 --> 02:22:43,920
thought patterns,
these,

3178
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:44,933
these limiting beliefs,
these things that are not helpful for 

3179
02:22:47,011 --> 02:22:47,844
the coaches,

3180
02:22:48,070 --> 02:22:48,903
committed to do these things that you 
have in your idea and in your mind like 

3181
02:22:52,811 --> 02:22:53,644
don't be so set in your ideas.
Cause understand that people have to be 

3182
02:22:56,261 --> 02:22:57,094
just as sat in their ideas in order to,
I'll lash someone for being in close 

3183
02:23:00,971 --> 02:23:05,020
proximity with a man or to lash.
Someone who had sex with a woman.

3184
02:23:05,300 --> 02:23:06,970
You know those,
those people have the same.

3185
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:07,833
Or to wait til a woman who's pregnant 
gives birth before you give her a 

3186
02:23:10,961 --> 02:23:13,750
beating with a stick because she had 
sex.

3187
02:23:14,020 --> 02:23:14,853
That's the,
those people believe what they believe 

3188
02:23:17,050 --> 02:23:17,883
just as firmly and a lot of the notions 
that we have that we think there are 

3189
02:23:20,951 --> 02:23:21,784
rigid rules.
They're not rigid rules except dudes 

3190
02:23:24,581 --> 02:23:26,200
with man buns.
Let it go.

3191
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:30,790
Let it go.
Stop twisting your mustache in a circle.

3192
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:34,090
No more man Bun.
No more pocket watch.

3193
02:23:34,330 --> 02:23:36,010
Fuck you.
How about that

3194
02:23:36,340 --> 02:23:39,250
says the man with the fanny pack on.
Ironically,

3195
02:23:42,550 --> 02:23:43,660
but you know what I'm saying.

3196
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:44,541
Yeah man.
Man.

3197
02:23:44,541 --> 02:23:46,430
Bus.
They're not necessary.

3198
02:23:46,970 --> 02:23:48,290
What are you doing,
Steven Seagal.

3199
02:23:48,380 --> 02:23:51,030
He doesn't even wear one anymore.
He gave it up and we were pat.

3200
02:23:51,070 --> 02:23:53,300
I got some man been friends.
They're going to be disappointed.

3201
02:23:53,360 --> 02:23:55,220
I know they are.
They're trying hard.

3202
02:23:55,221 --> 02:23:58,140
They're trying hard to wear that vest.
Yeah.

3203
02:23:58,210 --> 02:24:01,100
Those weird shoes,
the wooden soles,

3204
02:24:01,340 --> 02:24:02,173
everybody just j everybody's just 
looking for love and they're looking to 

3205
02:24:04,271 --> 02:24:06,260
judge themselves as a good person,
you know?

3206
02:24:06,261 --> 02:24:07,100
And,
and that's,

3207
02:24:07,430 --> 02:24:08,263
that's,
those are two things that you can get 

3208
02:24:09,711 --> 02:24:10,640
yourself,
you know,

3209
02:24:10,641 --> 02:24:11,474
you can understand that you're worthy of
love and supply that and you can 

3210
02:24:13,521 --> 02:24:16,130
understand that you're a good person.
Just being a person.

3211
02:24:16,131 --> 02:24:17,330
Like,
you know,

3212
02:24:17,331 --> 02:24:18,830
you don't have to be better than 
somebody.

3213
02:24:18,831 --> 02:24:21,800
You don't have to shit on somebody.
You don't have to have this identity,

3214
02:24:22,010 --> 02:24:23,640
you know,
everybody could just relax.

3215
02:24:23,641 --> 02:24:27,350
Then I think all of a lot of this 
striving and conflict and suffering,

3216
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:29,420
you know,
just fucking falls away.

3217
02:24:29,421 --> 02:24:33,680
Like it's so easy to say like that's a 
beautiful concept.

3218
02:24:33,681 --> 02:24:34,430
You're worthy of love,

3219
02:24:34,430 --> 02:24:35,263
love.
But I think people have to experience a 

3220
02:24:35,961 --> 02:24:39,290
certain amount of difficulty in their 
life just to exercise their system.

3221
02:24:39,650 --> 02:24:40,483
I think our system is put in place to 
have a certain amount of obstacles to 

3222
02:24:43,101 --> 02:24:43,934
overcome and when we don't have any or 
when it's like really simple stuff 

3223
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:48,500
that's fucking boring,
you know?

3224
02:24:48,530 --> 02:24:50,810
I think people have real problems with 
that.

3225
02:24:51,020 --> 02:24:54,020
I think we have real problems with our 
minds,

3226
02:24:54,050 --> 02:24:56,240
real problems physically with our entire
unit.

3227
02:24:56,870 --> 02:25:00,980
I think we absolutely need a certain 
amount of exertion,

3228
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:02,350
you know?
And,

3229
02:25:02,350 --> 02:25:04,730
and my,
I mean in might not even be physical.

3230
02:25:04,970 --> 02:25:05,480
Like,
um,

3231
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:06,313
my friend drawn,
drawn Horton and went to Colorado with 

3232
02:25:08,751 --> 02:25:09,680
him.
We did a gig out there.

3233
02:25:09,830 --> 02:25:13,820
He just got into chess just a madman.
But the chest now playing on his phone,

3234
02:25:13,821 --> 02:25:15,710
constantly moving things around and he's
like,

3235
02:25:15,711 --> 02:25:16,281
you want to play?
I'm like,

3236
02:25:16,281 --> 02:25:17,114
fuck that.
I'm not getting sucked into that God 

3237
02:25:18,291 --> 02:25:20,780
damn rabbit hole.
I see him there on the plane.

3238
02:25:20,781 --> 02:25:23,120
Can't wait to play chess since we're off
in the sky.

3239
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:24,010
I'll fucking with his

3240
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:24,843
phone.
Shit.

3241
02:25:25,810 --> 02:25:28,720
That's uh,
that is another discipline.

3242
02:25:28,721 --> 02:25:29,740
I mean,
they're all disciplines.

3243
02:25:29,741 --> 02:25:33,190
They're all these different things that 
you try to seek truth through.

3244
02:25:33,320 --> 02:25:35,320
I mean,
chess is a form of combat,

3245
02:25:35,850 --> 02:25:37,300
you know,
it's just not painful,

3246
02:25:37,540 --> 02:25:38,830
but it's most certainly,
yeah,

3247
02:25:38,831 --> 02:25:41,930
it's a form of combat.
It's absolutely a form of,

3248
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:43,300
it's a contest.
You know,

3249
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:44,193
if you treat it as a war,
I mean that is essentially what you're 

3250
02:25:45,881 --> 02:25:46,714
doing.
Like you're breaking it down to a very 

3251
02:25:48,371 --> 02:25:52,690
innocuous but very safe,
but very obvious what's going on.

3252
02:25:52,750 --> 02:25:56,560
I'm testing my intellect against your 
intellect and we're going to do it.

3253
02:25:56,590 --> 02:26:01,090
Do so through a very established series 
of movements of these things are allowed

3254
02:26:01,091 --> 02:26:02,440
to participate in.
We have a,

3255
02:26:02,441 --> 02:26:04,930
a established playing field.
You know the rules.

3256
02:26:04,931 --> 02:26:07,780
I know the real rules.
I think I'm smarter than you go.

3257
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:10,450
And you have that little clock thing 
that those dudes to have those dudes,

3258
02:26:10,451 --> 02:26:11,620
they fuck they fuck with you.

3259
02:26:11,620 --> 02:26:13,570
So they move it quick and then eat that 
fucking clock.

3260
02:26:13,870 --> 02:26:15,850
Ooh.
And you want to move a quick tool.

3261
02:26:15,851 --> 02:26:17,500
You want to say fuck you bitch.
I know that.

3262
02:26:17,530 --> 02:26:18,110
Ah,
click,

3263
02:26:18,110 --> 02:26:18,521
click,
click,

3264
02:26:18,521 --> 02:26:18,941
click,
click,

3265
02:26:18,941 --> 02:26:19,361
click,
click,

3266
02:26:19,361 --> 02:26:20,194
clack.
And you see them giving up pieces and 

3267
02:26:20,921 --> 02:26:23,150
moving fast.
That's some mental war.

3268
02:26:23,151 --> 02:26:28,151
They're playing a mental,
some sort of a strategic conquest game.

3269
02:26:28,930 --> 02:26:30,400
Yeah.
And that's uh,

3270
02:26:30,530 --> 02:26:31,440
and you know,
that's one,

3271
02:26:31,480 --> 02:26:33,430
like you said,
that discipline,

3272
02:26:33,460 --> 02:26:35,680
there's so many ways up the mountain,
but you need a mountain.

3273
02:26:35,700 --> 02:26:36,880
You need something.
You need a mountain.

3274
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:37,751
I met.
It doesn't,

3275
02:26:37,751 --> 02:26:40,130
it's not mutually exclusive to,
you know,

3276
02:26:40,270 --> 02:26:43,510
the self love aspect.
You can still find your mountain,

3277
02:26:43,630 --> 02:26:44,463
you know,
without thinking you're a piece of shit 

3278
02:26:45,401 --> 02:26:47,770
when you stumble because everybody 
fucking stumbles.

3279
02:26:47,771 --> 02:26:48,604
It doesn't mean you're a piece of shit.
It doesn't mean that you should hate 

3280
02:26:49,931 --> 02:26:50,510
yourself.

3281
02:26:50,510 --> 02:26:51,343
It doesn't mean that you should isolate 
yourself from the love of the world 

3282
02:26:53,111 --> 02:26:53,944
because you feel you're not worthy of it
and is create these negative patterns 

3283
02:26:56,771 --> 02:26:57,581
like,
yes,

3284
02:26:57,581 --> 02:26:59,950
go out fucking fine your mountain.
But when you stumble,

3285
02:26:59,951 --> 02:27:02,680
like everybody fucking does understand 
that.

3286
02:27:02,681 --> 02:27:04,930
That's just life.
Like we're all going to stumble.

3287
02:27:04,931 --> 02:27:07,510
You just get up and keep going.
Maybe you bitch,

3288
02:27:08,410 --> 02:27:11,170
I'm not stumbling.
I got this thing I'm doing,

3289
02:27:11,171 --> 02:27:13,390
Bro.
I'm doing a lot of tight rope walking in

3290
02:27:13,391 --> 02:27:15,250
the house.
I got rope set up all around the house,

3291
02:27:15,730 --> 02:27:18,460
Tyrell proc into the kitchen.
I figured somebody could do it.

3292
02:27:18,550 --> 02:27:20,590
I saw this thing.
This dude lives in the mountains,

3293
02:27:20,591 --> 02:27:25,120
just tight ropes to work.
You mean someone tight ropes,

3294
02:27:25,121 --> 02:27:25,954
right across these giant spaces.
What w what's to stop people from just 

3295
02:27:28,571 --> 02:27:29,404
doing that all the time from creating 
like a civilization high up in the sky 

3296
02:27:31,900 --> 02:27:33,070
and if you fall down you're fucked.

3297
02:27:33,070 --> 02:27:33,903
So don't fall and uh,
just tight rope because people love to 

3298
02:27:35,981 --> 02:27:37,570
drink.
That's why that's a problem.

3299
02:27:37,720 --> 02:27:38,553
That's why you got to get that 
psychedelic honey because it helps you 

3300
02:27:40,481 --> 02:27:43,630
tyrell better type room over to the 
psychedelic honeycomb.

3301
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:44,553
Snatch it while there you gotta stay 
calm while they're staying in the fuck 

3302
02:27:46,601 --> 02:27:48,830
out of you and you still in beehive 
stop.

3303
02:27:49,210 --> 02:27:51,700
You ever tried,
you ever gone skiing on mushrooms?

3304
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:56,890
You were telling me how awesome it is 
and I need to try it because I skiing to

3305
02:27:56,891 --> 02:27:59,380
me is a,
it's a weird thing.

3306
02:27:59,381 --> 02:28:00,214
It's like I can do it but I'm always 
like the consequences of this like 

3307
02:28:02,981 --> 02:28:05,590
little bit of fun.
It's really not worth it.

3308
02:28:05,830 --> 02:28:07,900
Like I do it because my family likes to 
do it,

3309
02:28:07,901 --> 02:28:09,820
but part of me is like,
don't fall down bitch.

3310
02:28:09,821 --> 02:28:11,710
Don't fall down bitch.
Don't fall down bitch.

3311
02:28:11,740 --> 02:28:13,420
Okay,
here we go again.

3312
02:28:13,450 --> 02:28:14,790
Don't fall down.
Don't fall down.

3313
02:28:17,410 --> 02:28:18,970
I mean it's fun.
I get it.

3314
02:28:18,971 --> 02:28:21,100
And if I was better at it would probably
be even more fun,

3315
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:22,610
but it's like,
dude,

3316
02:28:22,611 --> 02:28:25,580
I know too many people that have fucked 
their bodies up skiing.

3317
02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:26,443
I mean fucked up,
blown their neat cap up to the side of 

3318
02:28:29,781 --> 02:28:34,090
their hip and their fucking legs broken 
seven places and their next never moving

3319
02:28:34,091 --> 02:28:36,200
to the left ever again and like,
Whoa,

3320
02:28:36,201 --> 02:28:37,520
what happened?
I hit a tree.

3321
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:40,580
I'm one of the lucky ones.
I think that's people.

3322
02:28:40,610 --> 02:28:43,850
That's why people liked skiing and even 
why people like riding a motorcycle,

3323
02:28:43,851 --> 02:28:44,684
it's like the stakes are high.
When the stakes are high you have to 

3324
02:28:47,031 --> 02:28:49,250
focus on what you're doing then your 
present again.

3325
02:28:49,310 --> 02:28:51,020
So it's fun.
Yeah,

3326
02:28:51,160 --> 02:28:52,610
you got to get better at it.
That's what it is.

3327
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:57,760
Just coming up with bitch ass excuses,
but it's,

3328
02:28:57,770 --> 02:28:58,730
it's what's easier.

3329
02:28:58,730 --> 02:29:00,590
Snowboarding or skiing,
skiing,

3330
02:29:00,591 --> 02:29:03,080
I think really,
at least for,

3331
02:29:03,081 --> 02:29:04,730
at least for me when I've tried it 
snowboarding,

3332
02:29:04,731 --> 02:29:05,564
the falls are way gnarlier because when 
you fall and you catch like your toe 

3333
02:29:11,691 --> 02:29:13,370
edge,
like you slam back.

3334
02:29:13,490 --> 02:29:14,510
Oh yeah.
I've gotten,

3335
02:29:15,650 --> 02:29:16,483
I hit my head so hard coming from a 
steep mountain down into a flat and 

3336
02:29:20,001 --> 02:29:21,800
caught an edge on this icy part.
Oh,

3337
02:29:21,830 --> 02:29:26,570
I hit the back of my head so hard that 
the front of my goggle lenses popped off

3338
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:27,583
into the air,
like a fucking pop tart out of a 

3339
02:29:29,151 --> 02:29:30,440
toaster.
All right.

3340
02:29:30,830 --> 02:29:32,780
And I was fucked.
Like I couldn't just,

3341
02:29:32,930 --> 02:29:33,763
yeah.
Yeah.

3342
02:29:34,150 --> 02:29:36,530
Cause I woke up,
people were like helpfully,

3343
02:29:37,240 --> 02:29:39,020
like terrified helpfully,
like you,

3344
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:40,790
okay.
So that probably wouldn't happen to your

3345
02:29:40,791 --> 02:29:41,510
skin,
Huh?

3346
02:29:41,510 --> 02:29:42,343
They can,
but it's less likely because the way 

3347
02:29:43,641 --> 02:29:46,570
that you catch that edge and just like 
hook up the hookup,

3348
02:29:46,610 --> 02:29:50,390
the board and it's like a slingshot and 
just slams your head back down.

3349
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:51,373
We're skiing,
you'll like usually skid out or tumble 

3350
02:29:53,781 --> 02:29:54,460
or,
right.

3351
02:29:54,460 --> 02:29:55,490
I mean,
I'm one of those things.

3352
02:29:55,491 --> 02:29:57,050
So yeah,
I think the con,

3353
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:57,913
I mean that's why it makes it harder to 
learn because there's these fucking 

3354
02:30:00,201 --> 02:30:04,200
fatal crashes you do on a snowboard.
Yeah.

3355
02:30:04,330 --> 02:30:05,163
And skiing to men.
Sometimes some people get too close to 

3356
02:30:07,341 --> 02:30:08,750
you,
like that's another problem.

3357
02:30:08,751 --> 02:30:10,190
Like they don't know how to control 
themselves.

3358
02:30:10,191 --> 02:30:10,910
Very good.
Yeah.

3359
02:30:10,910 --> 02:30:11,743
And they're kind of like out of control.
And so you have to kind of like adjust 

3360
02:30:14,451 --> 02:30:16,820
quickly to get away from them.
Like,

3361
02:30:16,821 --> 02:30:18,710
Oh shit.
Like this lady was coming down like,

3362
02:30:18,740 --> 02:30:19,573
ah,
like it looked like she was going to go 

3363
02:30:20,631 --> 02:30:21,740
down hard,
but she,

3364
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:22,820
she got by me,
I'm like,

3365
02:30:22,850 --> 02:30:24,440
Oh shit,
I've got a ductus lady.

3366
02:30:24,630 --> 02:30:27,710
And so I had to take a hard left,
but then the trees are right there.

3367
02:30:27,711 --> 02:30:28,401
I'm like,
fuck,

3368
02:30:28,401 --> 02:30:30,350
I gotta take a hard right and hope it 
ain't working.

3369
02:30:30,830 --> 02:30:32,150
Boom.
When I started.

3370
02:30:32,180 --> 02:30:34,400
But it was,
I was fine,

3371
02:30:34,401 --> 02:30:35,200
but I was like,
Ooh,

3372
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:36,033
boy.
Like that can go wrong if you're in the 

3373
02:30:38,061 --> 02:30:38,894
wrong spot when that happens.
Like if there's a tree there and you 

3374
02:30:40,731 --> 02:30:41,564
cannot get away from that tree,
like you gotta be real fucking careful 

3375
02:30:45,471 --> 02:30:47,720
who you zig and zag.
I'll take that bitch out next time.

3376
02:30:48,540 --> 02:30:50,120
Like if we're near a tree.
Sorry Lady.

3377
02:30:50,150 --> 02:30:51,800
We're both going down together hoping 
not to fall.

3378
02:30:52,790 --> 02:30:55,190
Fucking good to say don't swerve for the
deer.

3379
02:30:55,430 --> 02:30:56,510
Ah,
yeah.

3380
02:30:56,511 --> 02:30:58,190
He's supposed to just hit the gas,
right?

3381
02:30:58,280 --> 02:30:59,113
No,
no.

3382
02:31:00,840 --> 02:31:03,530
He's supposed to not do anything.
She was just let it hit your car,

3383
02:31:03,531 --> 02:31:04,364
but that's ridiculous.
That's like saying don't blink with 

3384
02:31:05,661 --> 02:31:06,494
someone,
punches you.

3385
02:31:06,900 --> 02:31:07,733
How many deers do you get to hit before 
you realize not to hit the gas like it 

3386
02:31:10,431 --> 02:31:11,750
takes?
It would be like,

3387
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:14,300
like you ever seen a picture of Floyd 
Mayweather eating a jab?

3388
02:31:14,480 --> 02:31:15,313
Like he's cutting a punch to the face 
but his eyes are wide open and he's 

3389
02:31:17,271 --> 02:31:20,100
punching back because he's so 
conditioned to being

3390
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:20,933
punchy.
So used to it that he can keep his eyes 

3391
02:31:22,471 --> 02:31:24,870
open as the punches are coming in and 
then counter perfectly.

3392
02:31:25,410 --> 02:31:27,150
You're not going to have that kind of 
resolve with a deer.

3393
02:31:27,230 --> 02:31:28,380
No.
You're going to hit that break.

3394
02:31:28,570 --> 02:31:29,403
Yeah,
you're going to swerve good again when 

3395
02:31:30,691 --> 02:31:31,524
them giant fucking meat cleaver bumpers 
and they have like people live in 

3396
02:31:34,351 --> 02:31:37,500
Wyoming and shit.
They have those road warrior bumpers and

3397
02:31:37,501 --> 02:31:38,334
the trucks.
It just makes different stakes cut and 

3398
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:45,090
I'm like t bone and then it's like,
it's like extruded like Plato.

3399
02:31:45,210 --> 02:31:46,043
Yeah.
You have to like some places you can't 

3400
02:31:48,450 --> 02:31:50,550
just throw it in the back of your truck 
either.

3401
02:31:50,551 --> 02:31:51,384
You'd have to kind of call somebody and 
prove that you hit it that way cause 

3402
02:31:53,491 --> 02:31:55,730
they want to discourage poaching.
That's it.

3403
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,073
Well it makes a lot of sense man.
But fuck deer jumping in front of your 

3404
02:32:04,951 --> 02:32:05,730
car.

3405
02:32:05,730 --> 02:32:07,110
What are the odds that you're going to 
go,

3406
02:32:07,111 --> 02:32:09,180
okay,
you can't hit those brakes.

3407
02:32:09,181 --> 02:32:12,660
Remember they said just don't swerve,
just hit the deer.

3408
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:14,453
I think some people are better at that 
super calm moment of like decision 

3409
02:32:18,031 --> 02:32:18,864
making and crisis.
Like I've been around people in certain 

3410
02:32:21,451 --> 02:32:24,450
situations that like are you can't 
prepare for.

3411
02:32:24,451 --> 02:32:27,860
And then there's some people who just 
freeze like straight fucking freeze.

3412
02:32:27,861 --> 02:32:28,694
Yeah.
And then some people act and I think 

3413
02:32:29,491 --> 02:32:33,120
like all like off police officers and 
military,

3414
02:32:33,121 --> 02:32:35,160
they train yourself past the freeze.
But it's funny,

3415
02:32:35,161 --> 02:32:35,994
like I was in Australia and this dude 
was drinking Bundaberg over proof rum 

3416
02:32:40,650 --> 02:32:43,980
and he was used to doing this trick with
regular butter proof from,

3417
02:32:43,981 --> 02:32:44,814
which is Bundaberg rum,
where he lights it on fire and pours it 

3418
02:32:47,291 --> 02:32:49,290
in his mouth and it goes out when it 
hits his mouth.

3419
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:52,890
But he was doing it instead with over 
proof from right.

3420
02:32:52,890 --> 02:32:54,420
Was He never done before?
Well,

3421
02:32:54,421 --> 02:32:55,254
the thing was over proof from is that 
mother fucker doesn't go out ever 

3422
02:32:57,451 --> 02:32:58,284
period.
Like the wind is not going to get it 

3423
02:32:59,301 --> 02:33:00,134
out.
So he's pouring his flaming shot and it 

3424
02:33:02,041 --> 02:33:04,200
doesn't go out and so it's face catches 
fire.

3425
02:33:04,230 --> 02:33:05,063
Oh Jesus.
Full full on hell raiser face catches 

3426
02:33:07,351 --> 02:33:08,184
fire.
He's in the kitchen of the house we're 

3427
02:33:08,791 --> 02:33:12,570
renting and like everybody is just 
looking at him,

3428
02:33:12,571 --> 02:33:14,250
he's clawing and his face is not 
working.

3429
02:33:14,251 --> 02:33:19,160
Obviously he doesn't know what to do.
And then I'm looking at them and I don't

3430
02:33:19,170 --> 02:33:21,120
know what the fuck to do and everybody's
just staying there.

3431
02:33:21,121 --> 02:33:24,760
So I go to the Faucet and I'm like 
trying to get water and like spray it on

3432
02:33:24,780 --> 02:33:26,190
from the fall,
not the right thing.

3433
02:33:26,191 --> 02:33:28,530
I should have put like a towel or a roof
over his head,

3434
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:29,573
you know,
but you just don't think you're not 

3435
02:33:30,961 --> 02:33:32,370
prepared at that moment.

3436
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:33,660
You know?
And then,

3437
02:33:34,020 --> 02:33:37,200
and then so eventually he fucking rolls 
around on the ground and gets it,

3438
02:33:37,530 --> 02:33:38,363
get figured out.
He got burned but it was more like a 

3439
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:42,000
facial,
like took the,

3440
02:33:42,090 --> 02:33:45,180
took the first layer off and he had like
a nice laser peel.

3441
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:46,103
Oh yeah.
Like when someone goes does that and it 

3442
02:33:47,101 --> 02:33:48,980
doesn't say anything and you sort of go,
okay,

3443
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:53,190
did you just visit the sun a little bit 
like that?

3444
02:33:53,191 --> 02:33:55,860
He ended up ended up being fine but I've
been around other people.

3445
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:58,770
Like another incident,
it was like a home stripper pole.

3446
02:33:58,800 --> 02:33:59,690
Right.
And I was there with,

3447
02:33:59,840 --> 02:34:03,180
I was there with Roger where ty.
Right and how's you should never buy,

3448
02:34:03,510 --> 02:34:04,343
I'm talking about a haunted house or 
your own poles alum superbad ago and it 

3449
02:34:07,801 --> 02:34:08,634
was,
it was tied to the wall and this girl 

3450
02:34:10,171 --> 02:34:12,330
gets on there and she's swinging.
She's a little bit bigger.

3451
02:34:12,650 --> 02:34:14,190
We're all around the raw kind of 
laughing.

3452
02:34:14,191 --> 02:34:15,840
Everybody's clothes were all just 
laughing and,

3453
02:34:16,140 --> 02:34:18,250
and,
and the pole goes

3454
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:19,083
like on hinges from the roof.
She's going timber from like 10 feet up 

3455
02:34:23,980 --> 02:34:26,380
inverted like it's going to be really 
bad.

3456
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:31,560
And literally everybody around the 
circle just looked like this is going to

3457
02:34:32,471 --> 02:34:33,304
be bad.
And Roger just quickly like immediately 

3458
02:34:35,141 --> 02:34:38,380
moves over and like grabs the Paul 
[inaudible] style.

3459
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:40,570
Right.
And that's when I realized like that's a

3460
02:34:40,571 --> 02:34:41,404
different dude.
That's a dude that when that totally 

3461
02:34:43,481 --> 02:34:44,314
random thing happens,
he has the ability to act instead of 

3462
02:34:47,411 --> 02:34:50,410
just look around like all of us dummies 
like damn,

3463
02:34:50,411 --> 02:34:51,780
that's going to hurt.
Yeah,

3464
02:34:52,040 --> 02:34:54,580
it's a good point.
That's hilarious.

3465
02:34:54,730 --> 02:34:55,563
Well Rogers,
the same guy that knocked out that 

3466
02:34:56,801 --> 02:34:58,690
fucking due to punch that girl in 
Austin.

3467
02:34:58,691 --> 02:35:01,510
Yeah.
That was a giant giant football player.

3468
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:02,613
Football player.
This is when Roger was fighting in the 

3469
02:35:04,211 --> 02:35:07,250
UFC and he was,
he's fighting it 155 pounds.

3470
02:35:07,251 --> 02:35:08,170
It's not a big guy.

3471
02:35:08,500 --> 02:35:11,680
And this a football player who knows 
what the story was,

3472
02:35:11,830 --> 02:35:14,570
walked up to some woman in,
punched her in the face and I don't know

3473
02:35:14,571 --> 02:35:15,800
in the back of the head.
Yeah.

3474
02:35:15,880 --> 02:35:18,070
What's,
so they were coming out of a club and it

3475
02:35:18,071 --> 02:35:19,900
was actually a club that we used to go 
to a lot.

3476
02:35:19,901 --> 02:35:21,460
I just happened to be out of town that 
weekend,

3477
02:35:21,461 --> 02:35:24,340
but we're kinda coming out of the club 
and this girl,

3478
02:35:24,341 --> 02:35:25,174
like he gets the guy gets an f,
like a fight with one of her boyfriends 

3479
02:35:28,541 --> 02:35:29,374
or whatever.
And then she's like the whole thing 

3480
02:35:30,281 --> 02:35:31,114
because he punches a girl in the hedge 
whole the whole thing from the 

3481
02:35:32,441 --> 02:35:34,690
beginning.
But no,

3482
02:35:34,691 --> 02:35:36,700
you get us a little bit of red there.
There you go.

3483
02:35:36,701 --> 02:35:38,380
Here comes boom.
Okay,

3484
02:35:38,381 --> 02:35:41,290
watch this punches are right in the back
of the head.

3485
02:35:41,890 --> 02:35:44,440
Boom.
And just flattens or,

3486
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:46,750
and then walks away and everybody's 
like,

3487
02:35:46,751 --> 02:35:47,920
what the fuck?

3488
02:35:48,270 --> 02:35:49,720
Yeah.
And this guy is huge.

3489
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:51,820
And look at Roger.
Roger walks up to him.

3490
02:35:51,821 --> 02:35:53,530
He's literally a hundred pounds lighter 
than him.

3491
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,140
And I'm like,
you're kidding.

3492
02:35:55,160 --> 02:35:56,740
And Roger starts talking to him.
He just says,

3493
02:35:56,741 --> 02:35:58,870
at that point,
you can't do that man.

3494
02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:00,430
You can't do that,
man.

3495
02:36:01,090 --> 02:36:03,820
Wow.
And so Roger Walks up and decides,

3496
02:36:03,821 --> 02:36:04,654
okay,
I'm taking my shirt off and takes his 

3497
02:36:05,951 --> 02:36:06,784
shirt off because he doesn't want to do 
to be able to grab his shirt like he's 

3498
02:36:09,041 --> 02:36:10,960
thinking strategically,
like,

3499
02:36:10,961 --> 02:36:11,794
which is like way one step ahead.
It's not like he's going to physically 

3500
02:36:13,661 --> 02:36:15,160
intimidate this guy.
The guy's giant.

3501
02:36:15,850 --> 02:36:20,850
And so roger standing in front of this 
guy and the dude's big and it looks like

3502
02:36:21,820 --> 02:36:24,070
somebody else tried to jump into 
somebody else,

3503
02:36:24,071 --> 02:36:28,660
tried to jump in on both sides and stop 
them from fighting the guy that guy runs

3504
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:32,230
and then roger corners corners and by 
the truck,

3505
02:36:32,231 --> 02:36:33,910
what you can't see you going on right 
now,

3506
02:36:34,040 --> 02:36:35,740
corn is and by the truck,
the guy swings,

3507
02:36:35,741 --> 02:36:36,574
Roger Somehow gets a minute,
muy Thai clinch and started kneeing him 

3508
02:36:38,831 --> 02:36:43,620
in the head and knees him in the head 
and then he gets them out of hosting and

3509
02:36:43,630 --> 02:36:47,530
stomps him and then runs hold pride 
rules style.

3510
02:36:47,590 --> 02:36:51,220
And this all happens in 1520 seconds.
Maybe not even.

3511
02:36:51,250 --> 02:36:52,420
It was really quick,
like,

3512
02:36:52,421 --> 02:36:53,254
yeah,
the whole video is only two minutes and 

3513
02:36:54,521 --> 02:36:59,230
28 seconds long and it became this viral
gigantic kit.

3514
02:36:59,500 --> 02:37:01,660
Whatever happened to that dude.
Did he get in trouble for that?

3515
02:37:02,070 --> 02:37:03,970
Um,
I don't know.

3516
02:37:04,030 --> 02:37:06,070
I don't think so.
I know that the police knew,

3517
02:37:06,100 --> 02:37:06,933
obviously the roger hit him and they 
just basically shook his hand and we're 

3518
02:37:09,611 --> 02:37:10,331
like,
yeah,

3519
02:37:10,331 --> 02:37:10,901
hey,
all right.

3520
02:37:10,901 --> 02:37:12,340
We understand.
You know.

3521
02:37:12,341 --> 02:37:12,791
But,
uh,

3522
02:37:12,791 --> 02:37:14,440
I don't think anything ever happened to 
that dude.

3523
02:37:14,441 --> 02:37:16,050
But that was fucking brutal and hard.

3524
02:37:16,050 --> 02:37:16,883
Just went full,
full overhand right to the back of that 

3525
02:37:19,191 --> 02:37:20,210
chick's head.
Yeah.

3526
02:37:20,910 --> 02:37:21,743
But he's just that type of dude.
He also saved somebody from drowning on 

3527
02:37:24,081 --> 02:37:25,140
the beach.
Raj.

3528
02:37:25,310 --> 02:37:26,143
Yeah.
He's just like finds himself in 

3529
02:37:27,051 --> 02:37:29,750
situations and he acts,
you know,

3530
02:37:29,751 --> 02:37:31,250
whereas other people,
you know,

3531
02:37:31,251 --> 02:37:33,020
might freeze or might not.
Well,

3532
02:37:33,021 --> 02:37:35,150
he has a brutal upbringing,
you know?

3533
02:37:35,151 --> 02:37:39,350
And I think sometimes people that have 
overcome brutality when they're younger,

3534
02:37:39,351 --> 02:37:41,570
they developed this ability to 
understand like,

3535
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:42,590
oh,
I've been here before.

3536
02:37:42,860 --> 02:37:45,230
I know what this is all about.
I know what this kind of chaos is.

3537
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:46,760
And there's only one way out of this 
thing.

3538
02:37:46,790 --> 02:37:51,410
You got to meet it head on where someone
is coddled who grows up and you know,

3539
02:37:51,411 --> 02:37:53,000
a cushion room.
Everything.

3540
02:37:53,030 --> 02:37:53,863
Everything's dolls,
no sharp edges that that person when 

3541
02:37:56,241 --> 02:37:59,840
confronted with some horrific situation,
like some giant steroids up,

3542
02:37:59,841 --> 02:38:00,674
football player punches a girl in the 
back of the head and you've got to act 

3543
02:38:03,170 --> 02:38:04,003
and that guy's a hundred pounds bigger 
than you and Roger just takes the shirt 

3544
02:38:06,591 --> 02:38:07,424
off.

3545
02:38:08,890 --> 02:38:09,531
Right.
It's just like,

3546
02:38:09,531 --> 02:38:11,200
well I can't have him grab me.
Yeah,

3547
02:38:12,350 --> 02:38:13,890
that's the dude you don't wanna fuck 
with you.

3548
02:38:13,900 --> 02:38:15,590
Sure.
Unemotional dude.

3549
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:18,620
I really wished that that he didn't have
that falling out with UFC.

3550
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:19,873
Yeah.
People forget the Roger worked or was 

3551
02:38:20,571 --> 02:38:24,500
the first guy to ever be on the cover of
sports illustrated for MMA.

3552
02:38:24,740 --> 02:38:26,560
He was on the fucking cover of sports 
illustrated.

3553
02:38:26,580 --> 02:38:29,630
He was being groomed as one of the top 
guys,

3554
02:38:30,020 --> 02:38:32,780
but there was some sort of dispute 
between him and the UFC.

3555
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:35,540
Who knows which side is correct.
Who knows what happened,

3556
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:37,490
but he wound up leaving the UFC and 
then,

3557
02:38:37,500 --> 02:38:38,333
yeah,
he just won his last fight so I have to 

3558
02:38:39,871 --> 02:38:41,300
do that.
Is he in one now?

3559
02:38:41,360 --> 02:38:43,530
Was he fighting over one RC?
One FC.

3560
02:38:43,531 --> 02:38:44,660
He's got some real talent,
man.

3561
02:38:44,930 --> 02:38:46,340
You know they've got,
ben asked went over there,

3562
02:38:47,300 --> 02:38:48,770
but I heard it's crazy.
You know,

3563
02:38:48,771 --> 02:38:50,540
he's got some real talent right now.
The bell tour,

3564
02:38:50,541 --> 02:38:51,374
welterweight division,
Douglas Lema just knocked out chorus 

3565
02:38:53,831 --> 02:38:56,570
cough.
You know that guy who a fucked up?

3566
02:38:56,600 --> 02:38:57,740
Uh,
um,

3567
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:00,380
uh,
what the hell is his name?

3568
02:39:01,110 --> 02:39:01,580
Okay.

3569
02:39:01,580 --> 02:39:03,070
What he,
he's beaten a few guys.

3570
02:39:03,071 --> 02:39:03,591
Let me think.
Chorus.

3571
02:39:03,591 --> 02:39:04,424
Cough.
Okay.

3572
02:39:05,570 --> 02:39:06,410
MMM.

3573
02:39:07,980 --> 02:39:09,070
Oh fuck.
Did he beat up?

3574
02:39:10,590 --> 02:39:12,010
God dammit.
What am I thinking of?

3575
02:39:12,040 --> 02:39:15,610
Who Give me his uh,
chorus cobb's last few.

3576
02:39:18,260 --> 02:39:19,093
I know he fought Benson Henderson.
He beat Benson Henderson up when Benson 

3577
02:39:21,301 --> 02:39:22,290
came over to,
um,

3578
02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:25,380
to tour and he fought as well to wait 
for the first time.

3579
02:39:25,710 --> 02:39:28,890
And then a Benson just fought.
You got it.

3580
02:39:33,390 --> 02:39:33,800
Oh,
who,

3581
02:39:33,800 --> 02:39:34,560
who,
wait a minute.

3582
02:39:34,560 --> 02:39:36,230
Why does it say Douglas Lema twice?
Douglas.

3583
02:39:36,231 --> 02:39:38,450
He was the opponent.
Who's is this course cough?

3584
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:40,140
Oh,
he lost a Doug Islam at twice.

3585
02:39:40,710 --> 02:39:42,780
Are you one the first one lost the 
second one.

3586
02:39:42,781 --> 02:39:45,240
The first one.
Cause Cor de Lima had a fucked up knee.

3587
02:39:45,241 --> 02:39:46,074
That's right.
And then he'd beat Benson and then Lima 

3588
02:39:47,710 --> 02:39:50,460
just crushed him in the rematch.
Which fight am I thinking of?

3589
02:39:50,461 --> 02:39:51,350
Man?
God,

3590
02:39:51,360 --> 02:39:52,410
I can't believe,
I can't believe,

3591
02:39:52,411 --> 02:39:53,244
I can't remember which side it was,
but the Benson Henderson one was a big 

3592
02:39:55,471 --> 02:39:57,030
one.
Even though it was a decision,

3593
02:39:57,060 --> 02:39:59,400
you could tell the difference in size is
pretty significant.

3594
02:39:59,401 --> 02:40:00,234
But then when Lima fought Korotkov,
you could see Lima looked way bigger 

3595
02:40:04,561 --> 02:40:06,210
than Korotkoff.
So they,

3596
02:40:06,240 --> 02:40:07,980
and they've got Paul Daley.
Okay.

3597
02:40:07,981 --> 02:40:09,310
That's what it is.
So Lima just,

3598
02:40:09,470 --> 02:40:12,120
I'm getting all confused.
Lima beat Paul Daley,

3599
02:40:12,180 --> 02:40:14,070
who's super legit and he beat him

3600
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:17,430
by decision and then just knocked out 
Korskoff I,

3601
02:40:17,460 --> 02:40:18,293
for some reason I thought Lima are 
thought daily had fought Korskoff I 

3602
02:40:21,541 --> 02:40:24,420
fucked it up.
But dailies Super Legit,

3603
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:26,340
I mean,
dailies a scary fucking striker.

3604
02:40:26,370 --> 02:40:29,610
Sure.
So for Lima to beat him and to be Benson

3605
02:40:29,610 --> 02:40:30,443
Henderson who's relatively undersized 
for the division and then to knock out 

3606
02:40:32,920 --> 02:40:35,700
Korotkoff like that,
I mean that was stunning shit.

3607
02:40:35,701 --> 02:40:38,010
I think he's world class.
And uh,

3608
02:40:38,190 --> 02:40:39,023
meanwhile that guy was ragdoll by Ben 
[inaudible] who is the one FC champ 

3609
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:42,533
ragdolled.
Both of them were Korotkoff cough and 

3610
02:40:44,131 --> 02:40:47,700
Lima Bolt Rag dog by aspirin.
Aspen's a motherfucker,

3611
02:40:47,730 --> 02:40:48,350
dude.
Yeah.

3612
02:40:48,350 --> 02:40:49,550
His minute.
Then another level.

3613
02:40:49,950 --> 02:40:50,820
Who,
when did he lose?

3614
02:40:50,821 --> 02:40:51,600
When did,
uh,

3615
02:40:51,600 --> 02:40:56,600
Douglas Lema lose to aspirin?
Put Up Lima's record again cause uh,

3616
02:40:57,820 --> 02:41:02,820
he did I fuck that up back in April,
2012.

3617
02:41:03,481 --> 02:41:05,100
Yeah.
See Lima's had some,

3618
02:41:05,101 --> 02:41:07,550
uh,
some serious injuries he's at.

3619
02:41:07,551 --> 02:41:10,020
He had serious knee surgery,
but uh,

3620
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:11,340
that was quite a few years ago.

3621
02:41:11,340 --> 02:41:13,890
But then ask her and did that to him.
He did that.

3622
02:41:13,891 --> 02:41:16,920
The korotkoff he,
he's done that to a lot of dudes.

3623
02:41:16,921 --> 02:41:17,754
He gets a of those guys and just,
they look like world beaters until he 

3624
02:41:21,601 --> 02:41:23,790
gets a hold of them.
You get two drags them lyman.

3625
02:41:23,791 --> 02:41:24,301
Good.
He did it.

3626
02:41:24,301 --> 02:41:25,710
The lyman good too.
Same thing.

3627
02:41:25,940 --> 02:41:27,930
It gets all of them,
dragged him to the ground,

3628
02:41:27,931 --> 02:41:29,520
beats the fuck out of them.
They can't get up.

3629
02:41:29,660 --> 02:41:32,400
It's just crazy.
And he's so relaxed.

3630
02:41:32,401 --> 02:41:35,100
When I saw him do that to somebody,
he's like riding.

3631
02:41:35,101 --> 02:41:37,410
I'm like a bowl,
like waving to the crowd.

3632
02:41:37,411 --> 02:41:38,700
People are booing.
He doesn't care.

3633
02:41:39,660 --> 02:41:41,130
He doesn't give a fuck.
It's crazy.

3634
02:41:41,180 --> 02:41:42,013
I mean,
I,

3635
02:41:42,150 --> 02:41:46,590
it's one of my most a perplexing puzzles
in mma,

3636
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:50,850
but he fought when he fought in,
um,

3637
02:41:51,060 --> 02:41:54,030
Bella tour when Jay Hiran went over 
there,

3638
02:41:54,031 --> 02:41:56,880
Jay Heran gave him a hell of a fight and
Jay Heron,

3639
02:41:56,910 --> 02:42:01,170
who was a very good fighter who didn't 
do so good in the UFC,

3640
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:06,180
but it was really talented and then went
over and had this fight with a acronym.

3641
02:42:06,250 --> 02:42:07,260
Beltour.
I mean,

3642
02:42:07,270 --> 02:42:08,670
Jay Heran was,
um,

3643
02:42:09,150 --> 02:42:11,970
you know,
a good wrestler with a little bit better

3644
02:42:11,971 --> 02:42:15,860
crisper striking than aspirin and magic.
Keep it on the feed lot and ask her,

3645
02:42:15,861 --> 02:42:16,694
had a real problem with that.
So that was one of those things where I 

3646
02:42:18,241 --> 02:42:18,661
was like,
man,

3647
02:42:18,661 --> 02:42:21,270
I want to see him against world class 
fighters,

3648
02:42:21,280 --> 02:42:23,930
know how to stop that take down against 
a real good wrestler.

3649
02:42:23,931 --> 02:42:25,890
And those that have stuff to take down 
who's his size?

3650
02:42:26,670 --> 02:42:28,250
But Michael Chandler just beat,
uh,

3651
02:42:28,400 --> 02:42:29,880
um,
Benson Henderson too.

3652
02:42:30,590 --> 02:42:32,400
They've got real talent over there now,
no doubt.

3653
02:42:32,610 --> 02:42:34,590
But it's still one of those things where
nobody watches it.

3654
02:42:34,650 --> 02:42:35,483
It's like you look at the ratings,
it's like they're lucky they get a few 

3655
02:42:38,010 --> 02:42:40,740
hundred thousand well it's the human,
it's the human drama that people love,

3656
02:42:40,770 --> 02:42:42,570
you know the,
and the bigger that personality,

3657
02:42:42,571 --> 02:42:45,300
the more it's a celebrity of the more 
interested you are in the fight.

3658
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:46,193
You know,
like you get to understand this 

3659
02:42:47,791 --> 02:42:48,624
character that conor mcgregor is and 
it's part of the compelling nature of 

3660
02:42:51,661 --> 02:42:52,494
watching the fight.
Like the personality people want to 

3661
02:42:54,781 --> 02:42:56,280
identify with it.
It's like some,

3662
02:42:56,490 --> 02:43:00,000
I think it's the difference between a 
good epic movie and a Shitty epic movie,

3663
02:43:00,090 --> 02:43:00,923
like a good epic movie.
You Fall in love with the characters 

3664
02:43:03,421 --> 02:43:06,870
before the fucked up stuff happens that 
propels them on their hero's journey.

3665
02:43:07,410 --> 02:43:08,243
You know,
you can't just go straight out of the 

3666
02:43:08,881 --> 02:43:11,980
gate and show that that whole backstory 
happen and then

3667
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:15,610
he's all of a sudden kicking ass like 
you want to be emotionally invested in.

3668
02:43:15,611 --> 02:43:16,444
Then every time they're swinging know,
swinging a sword or every time you're 

3669
02:43:19,481 --> 02:43:22,880
watching them punch and take down your 
way more invested.

3670
02:43:22,890 --> 02:43:23,723
And I think boxing did that with 24 
seven the UFC has done that with all of 

3671
02:43:26,411 --> 02:43:27,244
their embedded,
and I think that's just something that 

3672
02:43:29,170 --> 02:43:30,003
they do better than anybody else.
They get you emotionally invested into 

3673
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:37,000
the fighter and then when you're there,
you know that's when,

3674
02:43:37,060 --> 02:43:40,780
that's when you really want to watch.
There's also those epic personalities,

3675
02:43:40,781 --> 02:43:41,614
those mega personalities that come 
around around every few generations or 

3676
02:43:45,191 --> 02:43:47,110
once a generation or a couple of times a
generation,

3677
02:43:47,111 --> 02:43:49,830
I should probably say like the Tyson's 
or the sugar ray Leonard.

3678
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:52,330
So the people that people were just so 
compelled to watch,

3679
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:54,310
and connor is just one of those people.

3680
02:43:54,310 --> 02:43:56,620
If he was inboxing and having the same 
sort of success,

3681
02:43:56,770 --> 02:43:57,603
he'll be just as big.
He'd be gigantic if triple g had his 

3682
02:44:00,281 --> 02:44:02,710
personality and my God,
Oh my God,

3683
02:44:03,340 --> 02:44:04,173
I mean Jesus Christ.
But triple g's not doing things the way 

3684
02:44:07,571 --> 02:44:08,404
connor's doing things.
Not even close because connor has those 

3685
02:44:10,781 --> 02:44:13,300
little gloves on and you know,
he's fighting mma,

3686
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:16,960
he's,
he's landing these one shots like that.

3687
02:44:16,961 --> 02:44:20,230
Just stunned guys and have them rocked 
and he's putting them away like he's got

3688
02:44:20,231 --> 02:44:22,450
lead in his hands.
Sort of a different thing.

3689
02:44:22,451 --> 02:44:26,830
Like you see his fight with Josie Aldo 
that you very rarely see that happen.

3690
02:44:26,950 --> 02:44:30,250
13 seconds in a world championship 
boxing match where someone connects with

3691
02:44:30,251 --> 02:44:31,084
one shot flatline.
Somebody that's in the realm of MMA 

3692
02:44:34,421 --> 02:44:36,970
almost exclusively in early fights like 
that.

3693
02:44:37,240 --> 02:44:39,460
It's so rare than in a championship 
fight.

3694
02:44:39,730 --> 02:44:42,910
Someone knocked someone dead in 13 
seconds,

3695
02:44:42,940 --> 02:44:44,770
but in the UFC can happen all the time.

3696
02:44:45,280 --> 02:44:46,113
I mean it just fucking happens.
There's a lot less armor on that button 

3697
02:44:50,420 --> 02:44:52,390
on the lights out button.
Yeah,

3698
02:44:52,391 --> 02:44:54,700
less padding in there.
A lot harder to defend to.

3699
02:44:54,701 --> 02:44:56,380
It's easier to defend with those big 
gloves.

3700
02:44:56,460 --> 02:44:58,630
Yeah.
There's so much going on with big gloves

3701
02:44:58,631 --> 02:44:59,464
versus small gloves.
You see guys that have devoted their 

3702
02:45:01,271 --> 02:45:02,104
whole life to big glove defense and then
they come in in the small gloves just 

3703
02:45:05,021 --> 02:45:08,020
don't offer the same sort of protection.
Even look at Nicky Hoskins,

3704
02:45:08,021 --> 02:45:08,854
main defense.
He gets in that kind of turtle posts 

3705
02:45:11,180 --> 02:45:13,180
where he pretty much is covering 
everything.

3706
02:45:13,181 --> 02:45:14,830
That's super important.
You know,

3707
02:45:14,831 --> 02:45:17,290
in his head with his gloves and forearms
and Yup.

3708
02:45:17,380 --> 02:45:19,810
Can't do that with a little gloves.
No you can't.

3709
02:45:20,110 --> 02:45:20,943
But see,
that's one of the cool things about 

3710
02:45:22,061 --> 02:45:25,150
watching a guy like holt skins that he 
can do that like with the big gloves,

3711
02:45:25,190 --> 02:45:25,841
like,
oh look,

3712
02:45:25,841 --> 02:45:26,674
we can do here.

3713
02:45:26,810 --> 02:45:28,690
Right.
You can't hit that guy.

3714
02:45:28,780 --> 02:45:29,650
Well,
he uh,

3715
02:45:29,740 --> 02:45:31,450
did you ever see his fight with Raymond 
Daniels?

3716
02:45:31,510 --> 02:45:33,730
Two fights.
Walks him down,

3717
02:45:33,731 --> 02:45:35,050
man.
Just beats the legs up,

3718
02:45:35,051 --> 02:45:37,080
walks him down.
Starts beating the fuck out of him.

3719
02:45:37,290 --> 02:45:38,920
Yeah.
Just absorbs those shots.

3720
02:45:38,921 --> 02:45:42,190
Keeps Chop Chop chopping away.
He's a bad mother fucker,

3721
02:45:42,191 --> 02:45:44,530
dude.
There's a bunch of those guys now.

3722
02:45:44,980 --> 02:45:45,813
I just,
uh,

3723
02:45:46,570 --> 02:45:49,900
I just hope that it gets the attention 
that it deserves because these guys are,

3724
02:45:49,980 --> 02:45:50,813
you know,
they're really risking their health in 

3725
02:45:52,221 --> 02:45:53,830
such a dramatic way.
Well,

3726
02:45:53,860 --> 02:45:58,680
Whitney's working for glory now.
I saw Holla at miss two jets.

3727
02:45:58,750 --> 02:46:02,410
I saw that this is going to Germany.
We were in,

3728
02:46:02,411 --> 02:46:03,244
um,
we were in here and Joe Schilling and 

3729
02:46:04,841 --> 02:46:07,860
Eve Edwards and I did a glory fight 
companion and we're like,

3730
02:46:07,870 --> 02:46:08,703
oh shit.
I look away.

3731
02:46:09,430 --> 02:46:10,010
And if

3732
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:11,390
your mother fuckers does,
she like it.

3733
02:46:11,890 --> 02:46:14,420
She likes it.
It's um,

3734
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:16,550
you know,
just I,

3735
02:46:16,700 --> 02:46:20,630
for some reason I don't know what the 
reason is,

3736
02:46:20,631 --> 02:46:25,160
but for some reason it's just never 
completely like took root in America.

3737
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:27,770
But it's not because of the talent.
I think it's,

3738
02:46:27,771 --> 02:46:29,450
again,
you got to tell the stories,

3739
02:46:29,540 --> 02:46:30,950
you know,
that's what people want.

3740
02:46:31,670 --> 02:46:35,950
You need to have invest way more in the,
in the pre fight,

3741
02:46:35,960 --> 02:46:37,040
you know,
video crew.

3742
02:46:37,041 --> 02:46:40,410
It's putting out these videos or get a 
reality TV show.

3743
02:46:40,411 --> 02:46:42,410
So I think that's a genius thing that 
the UFC did.

3744
02:46:42,411 --> 02:46:46,340
Cause you're exposing people to the 
personality of these characters and then

3745
02:46:46,341 --> 02:46:47,780
when you watch him fight,
you care.

3746
02:46:48,350 --> 02:46:50,390
That's the fucking missing piece.
It's not,

3747
02:46:50,570 --> 02:46:51,403
I think they're always looking at how 
can we improve the actual sport you got 

3748
02:46:54,141 --> 02:46:55,550
to improve.
You know,

3749
02:46:55,580 --> 02:46:58,340
the people's access inside these 
combatants.

3750
02:46:58,340 --> 02:47:00,500
And I think that's the,
that's the key.

3751
02:47:00,950 --> 02:47:01,641
You don't.
Another thing,

3752
02:47:01,641 --> 02:47:02,474
it doesn't seem like there's a number,
like a venue that is anything even 

3753
02:47:07,671 --> 02:47:08,504
remotely like the venues that used to 
exist just like 10 years ago as far as 

3754
02:47:11,751 --> 02:47:12,584
like putting a fight on showtime or 
putting a fight on hbo or putting a 

3755
02:47:15,051 --> 02:47:15,884
fight on NBC seems like 10 20 years ago 
you could've put Moitai on NBC at nine 

3756
02:47:21,141 --> 02:47:24,380
o'clock at night at some crazy Moitai 
night and people would have got hooked.

3757
02:47:24,381 --> 02:47:24,861
Like,
Whoa,

3758
02:47:24,861 --> 02:47:25,694
this is nuts.
But now it seems like there's so many 

3759
02:47:28,101 --> 02:47:28,934
options for entertainment.
It's really difficult to like lock in a 

3760
02:47:32,541 --> 02:47:33,374
substantial group of people just by 
putting something on a certain time at 

3761
02:47:35,961 --> 02:47:37,430
night.
Like they have so many choices.

3762
02:47:37,460 --> 02:47:38,293
Yeah,
there's almost too many choices where 

3763
02:47:39,501 --> 02:47:40,334
almost like overrun with possibilities 
to stare into the looking glass and get 

3764
02:47:43,750 --> 02:47:44,583
chanted.

3765
02:47:44,900 --> 02:47:46,280
You know?
It's true.

3766
02:47:46,380 --> 02:47:47,213
And,
but I think ultimately that's our 

3767
02:47:47,871 --> 02:47:49,080
salvation.
You know,

3768
02:47:49,081 --> 02:47:49,914
you get all of the choices and then,
then you can really decide what you 

3769
02:47:53,031 --> 02:47:53,990
want.
You know,

3770
02:47:54,800 --> 02:47:57,730
I think we're going to be robots.
This is what I told him.

3771
02:47:57,920 --> 02:47:59,570
I really,
not just robots were that.

3772
02:47:59,571 --> 02:48:00,404
Anyways.
I think that's the cool part about 

3773
02:48:01,821 --> 02:48:05,300
westworld is it's showing that like 
where his robot,

3774
02:48:05,301 --> 02:48:07,220
whereas consciousness,
at what level,

3775
02:48:07,490 --> 02:48:09,800
and I think we're just a more 
complicated version of that.

3776
02:48:09,950 --> 02:48:10,510
Yeah,
man,

3777
02:48:10,510 --> 02:48:12,560
don't spoiler alert.
I haven't seen the last episode.

3778
02:48:12,660 --> 02:48:14,360
Yeah,
I haven't seen the last ones next week.

3779
02:48:14,500 --> 02:48:16,640
That's okay.
I've seen all of them up till now.

3780
02:48:16,641 --> 02:48:18,890
I'm caught up,
but a lot of people listening aren't,

3781
02:48:19,210 --> 02:48:20,210
yeah.
Yeah.

3782
02:48:20,870 --> 02:48:21,703
I think before that ever happens before 
there's a place where you can go and 

3783
02:48:23,991 --> 02:48:26,660
interact with robots.
You're going to be one.

3784
02:48:26,810 --> 02:48:27,643
I think it's going to be way more likely
that you're going to take people that 

3785
02:48:30,591 --> 02:48:32,960
have been injured,
like soldiers that have lost a limb in a

3786
02:48:32,961 --> 02:48:33,794
war,
they're gonna replace it with better 

3787
02:48:34,431 --> 02:48:37,730
limbs than the first person is going to 
offer to get their limbs cut off.

3788
02:48:37,910 --> 02:48:38,743
It's probably gonna be someone with a 
disease where the limbs don't work so 

3789
02:48:40,371 --> 02:48:41,204
well.
They get them cut off and then they win 

3790
02:48:42,201 --> 02:48:43,034
the Olympics.
Just start jumping over buildings and 

3791
02:48:44,421 --> 02:48:45,290
shit.
Next thing you know,

3792
02:48:45,291 --> 02:48:46,820
everybody's like,
why don't have these regular legs?

3793
02:48:47,360 --> 02:48:48,193
And then one day it's going to get to a 
point where you can take your whole 

3794
02:48:49,881 --> 02:48:50,714
brain,
take that brain sticking into fuck 

3795
02:48:52,450 --> 02:48:55,250
another body.
I think it's not necessarily the brain.

3796
02:48:55,251 --> 02:48:58,250
I think it's whatever that that thing 
that we call consciousness,

3797
02:48:58,251 --> 02:49:01,850
maybe that originates from the brain.
Maybe it's something something separate,

3798
02:49:01,851 --> 02:49:02,684
but the transfer of consciousness,
that's one of those archetipal stories 

3799
02:49:05,391 --> 02:49:06,224
like a religious story.
The the shape shifter like you find in 

3800
02:49:08,431 --> 02:49:09,264
so many cultures,
someone who can transfer their 

3801
02:49:11,041 --> 02:49:11,874
consciousness to another vehicle.
I think that's definitely going to 

3802
02:49:14,731 --> 02:49:15,564
happen.
Like we're going to be able to transfer 

3803
02:49:16,801 --> 02:49:21,330
our consciousness into other things that
can hold that level of complexity.

3804
02:49:21,660 --> 02:49:22,493
You know,
like as long as it can hold that level 

3805
02:49:23,311 --> 02:49:24,144
of complexity.
Like I think trying to transfer our 

3806
02:49:25,351 --> 02:49:28,290
consciousness into a stinkbug would be 
really challenging.

3807
02:49:28,291 --> 02:49:30,660
Obviously the brain and how it worked,
it's too,

3808
02:49:30,690 --> 02:49:33,030
it's putting something that's too big 
and something too little,

3809
02:49:33,031 --> 02:49:35,610
but if something is of,
you know,

3810
02:49:35,670 --> 02:49:36,503
similar complexity,
I think we could transfer our 

3811
02:49:37,981 --> 02:49:38,814
consciousness into there.
We just got to figure out what 

3812
02:49:40,081 --> 02:49:41,940
consciousness is,
how you know,

3813
02:49:41,941 --> 02:49:42,774
how we measure it.
Somewhere in between the spaces of 

3814
02:49:45,090 --> 02:49:47,250
quantum physics or maybe that's the 
frontier.

3815
02:49:47,251 --> 02:49:48,084
Maybe it's somewhere,
but how we transfer that I think will 

3816
02:49:50,761 --> 02:49:51,594
ultimately figure out,
and I think we know it and I think 

3817
02:49:53,131 --> 02:49:55,050
that's why it's in all these stories.
They're going to work.

3818
02:49:55,760 --> 02:49:56,910
Yeah.
They're going to have conversations with

3819
02:49:56,911 --> 02:49:57,571
people.
They say,

3820
02:49:57,571 --> 02:49:58,590
hey man,
don't worry about it.

3821
02:49:58,591 --> 02:50:00,240
We made a copy of your brain so it 
doesn't work.

3822
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:01,860
We just put you back in your own body.
Yeah.

3823
02:50:01,861 --> 02:50:02,581
Like,
oh cool,

3824
02:50:02,581 --> 02:50:03,840
you made a coffee.
Yeah.

3825
02:50:03,860 --> 02:50:07,770
I mean it's copy from November 21st,
2016 do not worry.

3826
02:50:07,780 --> 02:50:08,613
Everything from here back.
You're not going to remember anything 

3827
02:50:09,991 --> 02:50:11,220
from today,
but it's no big deal,

3828
02:50:11,221 --> 02:50:12,450
man.
You're going gonna lose a couple of days

3829
02:50:12,451 --> 02:50:16,920
of shit going on and you catch up,
get on your twitter or the top trending.

3830
02:50:16,940 --> 02:50:17,773
Just objects,
just rides and it goes out a body for a 

3831
02:50:19,561 --> 02:50:20,700
little while,
stays current,

3832
02:50:20,701 --> 02:50:22,350
and then just drops back in.
Well,

3833
02:50:22,351 --> 02:50:26,010
now you're talking crazy.
I don't know why he of thing to the next

3834
02:50:26,011 --> 02:50:26,844
level.
I just feel like we're going to come to 

3835
02:50:30,421 --> 02:50:35,421
a point where we figure out how to 
express ourselves outside on language.

3836
02:50:35,850 --> 02:50:38,490
This is what I believe.
I believe that the intention,

3837
02:50:38,491 --> 02:50:41,400
like pure intention,
we're going to be able to broadcast that

3838
02:50:41,610 --> 02:50:44,430
through some form of third party 
software,

3839
02:50:44,431 --> 02:50:46,050
hardware solution,
whatever it is.

3840
02:50:46,290 --> 02:50:51,290
Like there'll be able to figure out what
the actual intention of a thought is and

3841
02:50:51,631 --> 02:50:54,000
transmit that and so instead of a 
sentence,

3842
02:50:54,001 --> 02:50:54,834
it will be a series of thoughts that you
can transfer the intention where you 

3843
02:50:58,291 --> 02:50:59,124
know it without language.
You don't have to have a comprehension 

3844
02:51:02,371 --> 02:51:03,204
of German to be able to communicate with
a person from Germany because you'll be 

3845
02:51:05,431 --> 02:51:06,264
able to see whatever they're thinking in
pure intent or feel it or know it or 

3846
02:51:11,161 --> 02:51:11,994
whatever the fuck it is.
And that's so much closer to truth than 

3847
02:51:14,011 --> 02:51:16,050
language,
which is always just an approximation.

3848
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:16,933
It's just a symbol for an idea.
Whereas if you could express in pure 

3849
02:51:19,381 --> 02:51:22,710
intent,
you know like just the feeling of it and

3850
02:51:22,711 --> 02:51:26,490
I think that's also what you experienced
sometimes in in the psychedelic state.

3851
02:51:26,491 --> 02:51:30,810
You feel what you would think is God and
you can't fucking describe it.

3852
02:51:30,870 --> 02:51:31,703
All of the words fail.
Nothing that makes sense when you're 

3853
02:51:33,961 --> 02:51:35,850
actually talking about it,
but you feel it.

3854
02:51:35,851 --> 02:51:36,684
And the intent of that thing is there 
and then you just approximate it and 

3855
02:51:39,361 --> 02:51:42,270
approximate it until it's almost gets 
ridiculous.

3856
02:51:42,300 --> 02:51:45,720
And it is ridiculous because you can't 
put that into words,

3857
02:51:45,750 --> 02:51:46,583
you know?
But you feel that and you only way you 

3858
02:51:49,141 --> 02:51:51,750
really have a reference if you'd 
experienced it as well.

3859
02:51:51,900 --> 02:51:52,733
Like you're saying this and I'm like,
I'm listening to you say this and I 

3860
02:51:54,871 --> 02:51:56,700
agree with you.
And then I'm like,

3861
02:51:56,701 --> 02:51:57,534
man,
how would I describe it any differently 

3862
02:51:58,621 --> 02:51:59,431
to somebody?
And I'm like,

3863
02:51:59,431 --> 02:52:01,950
well,
let's see what we got here for tools.

3864
02:52:02,070 --> 02:52:03,030
Oh,
they don't exist.

3865
02:52:03,540 --> 02:52:07,780
There's no tools in the toolbox that 
allow you to explain like a really heavy

3866
02:52:07,781 --> 02:52:11,170
duty breakthrough dmt trip did.
They don't exist.

3867
02:52:11,230 --> 02:52:13,660
Like you can try to approximate it,
but you sang it.

3868
02:52:13,690 --> 02:52:14,523
I register it.
But it's only because I have what I 

3869
02:52:16,841 --> 02:52:19,600
believe to be a similar experience to 
what you've experienced.

3870
02:52:19,660 --> 02:52:21,370
And even that,
it's just guesswork.

3871
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:23,200
Yeah.
And I'm assuming you're explaining,

3872
02:52:23,230 --> 02:52:25,600
you're explaining to me what went down 
when you had it.

3873
02:52:25,601 --> 02:52:26,434
And I'm like,
well that sounds a lot like how I would 

3874
02:52:28,090 --> 02:52:33,090
clumsily trying to explain my experience
but we don't know and you don't know.

3875
02:52:33,890 --> 02:52:36,160
Don't know.
And that's why we should go out and look

3876
02:52:36,161 --> 02:52:37,300
for yourself,
you know,

3877
02:52:37,390 --> 02:52:39,010
feel these things,
see these things,

3878
02:52:39,011 --> 02:52:41,360
experience these things.
But when you see burning man,

3879
02:52:41,770 --> 02:52:44,170
when you go to a place like burning man 
and you see what's possible,

3880
02:52:44,290 --> 02:52:47,440
I mean obviously I haven't been,
but you've been a few times when you see

3881
02:52:47,441 --> 02:52:48,274
what's possible.
When these fucking freaks I'll get 

3882
02:52:49,511 --> 02:52:51,460
together and rewrite the rules and go 
crazy.

3883
02:52:51,820 --> 02:52:52,930
It gives you a lot of hope.

3884
02:52:53,310 --> 02:52:54,143
It really does because it makes you 
realize like these are a lot of people 

3885
02:52:56,441 --> 02:52:57,274
with normal people around us and yet 
they're choosing in this one moment to 

3886
02:53:00,941 --> 02:53:05,860
behave in this stark contrast to 
everyday culture and society.

3887
02:53:05,861 --> 02:53:06,694
But there's no litter.
People are friendly with each other to 

3888
02:53:08,611 --> 02:53:09,444
give it away food.
Like they're only doing it for short 

3889
02:53:11,681 --> 02:53:12,910
bursts.
You know,

3890
02:53:12,911 --> 02:53:15,760
they're doing it for a week at a time.
Once a year,

3891
02:53:16,480 --> 02:53:18,880
but they're doing it.
They're still doing it.

3892
02:53:18,881 --> 02:53:22,360
And they didn't do it 30 years ago.
It didn't do it 50 years ago.

3893
02:53:22,660 --> 02:53:25,450
They're doing it now and they're doing 
it in one spot,

3894
02:53:26,050 --> 02:53:26,883
but we're talking about it and people 
were starting to get together and they 

3895
02:53:29,661 --> 02:53:30,071
go,
well let's,

3896
02:53:30,071 --> 02:53:32,440
we could do this more often.
Like we can do something similar to this

3897
02:53:32,441 --> 02:53:33,274
more often proves the concept because it
changes your view of how an interaction 

3898
02:53:37,841 --> 02:53:38,840
with a stranger could be.

3899
02:53:38,840 --> 02:53:42,300
It not somebody who's trying to take 
something from you and fuck you up,

3900
02:53:42,310 --> 02:53:43,510
fuck up your energy,
whatever.

3901
02:53:43,511 --> 02:53:46,120
Like you're all in it together in some 
weird way.

3902
02:53:46,121 --> 02:53:47,710
And obviously their shit heads at 
burning man too.

3903
02:53:47,711 --> 02:53:51,790
But you'd get the overwhelming consensus
that you're all in it together.

3904
02:53:52,560 --> 02:53:53,740
And it's a,
it's a cool,

3905
02:53:53,770 --> 02:53:57,550
cool feeling.
Just transcends these kind of very solid

3906
02:53:57,551 --> 02:53:58,280
cystic.
I'll,

3907
02:53:58,280 --> 02:53:59,620
I mean,
I would even for myself,

3908
02:53:59,650 --> 02:54:02,350
these are my things,
this is my fortress that I build and you

3909
02:54:02,351 --> 02:54:05,950
just collapse all that and,
and surrender to a much,

3910
02:54:05,951 --> 02:54:08,140
much happier state.
And that's part of the magic.

3911
02:54:08,230 --> 02:54:09,063
I mean,
isn't that one of the more genuine 

3912
02:54:09,971 --> 02:54:10,804
problems with any sort of egalitarian or
more altruistic vision is that people 

3913
02:54:18,041 --> 02:54:19,820
are not going to reciprocate.
Like,

3914
02:54:19,870 --> 02:54:20,703
you know,
like if you could find a like minded 

3915
02:54:21,911 --> 02:54:22,744
group of people where instead of the mob
mentality going fucking crazy and 

3916
02:54:25,871 --> 02:54:28,060
grabbing swords and chopping each shop 
each other out,

3917
02:54:28,061 --> 02:54:30,250
there's the mob mentality of peace and 
love.

3918
02:54:30,250 --> 02:54:34,030
We're all just sort of everybody around 
you sort of adopted this thing.

3919
02:54:34,031 --> 02:54:34,864
You know it really radical way that 
we're in fucking goggles and riding 

3920
02:54:37,451 --> 02:54:40,780
bikes everywhere and everything's lit up
a solar power and you're like,

3921
02:54:40,781 --> 02:54:42,370
Whoa,
these people are going deep with this.

3922
02:54:42,371 --> 02:54:44,710
Like everybody's embraced this,
so there,

3923
02:54:44,720 --> 02:54:45,553
so all in every fucking chip is on the 
table when you're out there that it 

3924
02:54:49,091 --> 02:54:49,924
reinforces this different and very 
peculiar sort of mob mentality that's 

3925
02:54:54,731 --> 02:54:55,890
psychedelic trip and,
and,

3926
02:54:55,891 --> 02:54:57,460
and happy,
you know,

3927
02:54:57,461 --> 02:54:58,294
and that that's possible too.
Like while we're watching mass rape in 

3928
02:55:01,871 --> 02:55:02,704
India,
you hear about these horrible instances 

3929
02:55:03,921 --> 02:55:04,754
where these men rape women on trains.
Like what the fuck is going on over 

3930
02:55:08,271 --> 02:55:09,860
there?
While that's happening,

3931
02:55:10,770 --> 02:55:11,900
Bernie man's happening.
Yeah.

3932
02:55:11,901 --> 02:55:12,734
It's like there's another,
there's another sort of mob 

3933
02:55:14,631 --> 02:55:19,631
consciousness that can erupt when it's 
considered carefully applied ethically,

3934
02:55:21,560 --> 02:55:25,520
morally,
sensitively with an open heart.

3935
02:55:25,860 --> 02:55:28,490
Like that can be done to like,
there's a bunch of different states.

3936
02:55:28,491 --> 02:55:30,380
Again,
you apply to who,

3937
02:55:30,390 --> 02:55:31,223
you know,
a human goes into an environment with 

3938
02:55:32,840 --> 02:55:36,440
love and radical acceptance.
True in in the truest sense.

3939
02:55:36,680 --> 02:55:39,620
You're going to more adapt to that.
Whereas you get in these systems of fear

3940
02:55:39,621 --> 02:55:40,880
and control,
you know,

3941
02:55:40,881 --> 02:55:44,150
you're going to adapt to that.
And I think anybody that we encounter,

3942
02:55:44,151 --> 02:55:47,330
we have that choice of what we're going 
to give back to them and turn that tide.

3943
02:55:47,331 --> 02:55:50,750
And maybe it won't be reciprocated,
but it can also stop the,

3944
02:55:51,020 --> 02:55:53,450
it can stop that trend.
So if someone really,

3945
02:55:53,620 --> 02:55:55,370
you know,
if they do something fucked up,

3946
02:55:55,430 --> 02:55:57,200
you know,
and you can't prevent it and you have to

3947
02:55:57,201 --> 02:55:59,540
accept it and move on except that with 
love,

3948
02:55:59,541 --> 02:56:00,374
show that person love and not this 
desire for justice and revenge and 

3949
02:56:03,891 --> 02:56:05,600
you'll start to switch the pattern.

3950
02:56:05,730 --> 02:56:06,500
You know,
you'll,

3951
02:56:06,500 --> 02:56:08,270
that's the only thing that ends the 
cycle.

3952
02:56:08,271 --> 02:56:11,060
The only thing that ends the cycle 
ultimately as love,

3953
02:56:11,061 --> 02:56:12,560
like violence,
you know,

3954
02:56:12,561 --> 02:56:15,260
you get something violent to you,
then you do something violent to them,

3955
02:56:15,261 --> 02:56:16,094
then you do something violent to you.
And it continues to go until one person 

3956
02:56:18,711 --> 02:56:20,300
just holds like,
man,

3957
02:56:20,301 --> 02:56:22,400
I see your pain,
I see where you're coming from.

3958
02:56:22,550 --> 02:56:24,260
I see you as me.
You know,

3959
02:56:24,261 --> 02:56:25,970
I'm sorry you've had been driven to that
state.

3960
02:56:25,971 --> 02:56:26,804
I'm going to love you no matter what.
And then all the sudden that person's 

3961
02:56:28,970 --> 02:56:30,200
like,
what the fuck?

3962
02:56:30,590 --> 02:56:34,420
And then it can end that cycle.
And I think that's what we gotta do in,

3963
02:56:34,440 --> 02:56:35,273
in society.
That's where we got to do the right and 

3964
02:56:36,411 --> 02:56:37,244
the left,
instead of continually shooting these 

3965
02:56:38,751 --> 02:56:39,584
barbs at each other.
At some point the conscious people have 

3966
02:56:41,601 --> 02:56:43,070
to say like,
you know,

3967
02:56:43,071 --> 02:56:45,140
whatever you say,
I hear you.

3968
02:56:45,170 --> 02:56:48,020
I don't necessarily agree.
Here's my point of view,

3969
02:56:48,050 --> 02:56:50,180
but I'm going to love you.
I'm going to love you as if you were me.

3970
02:56:50,480 --> 02:56:51,313
And then that ultimately ends it.
But as long as we're just lobbing 

3971
02:56:53,870 --> 02:56:56,360
fucking hand grenades at each other,
what fault?

3972
02:56:56,810 --> 02:56:59,120
Sounds like a bunch of hippy bullshit 
that trump's gonna make a legal,

3973
02:56:59,121 --> 02:56:59,954
that's what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking he's throwing people in 

3974
02:57:01,941 --> 02:57:03,980
jail for burning the flag.
We're taking it old school again,

3975
02:57:03,981 --> 02:57:05,900
folks,
old school,

3976
02:57:06,440 --> 02:57:07,273
you know,
uh,

3977
02:57:07,370 --> 02:57:09,200
the fake Tan that he uses is,
uh,

3978
02:57:09,230 --> 02:57:10,010
from,
uh,

3979
02:57:10,010 --> 02:57:12,980
he takes a native American graves and 
the,

3980
02:57:12,981 --> 02:57:13,814
uh,
he takes the soil and that's what they 

3981
02:57:15,861 --> 02:57:20,030
use for the fake Tan is the only way to 
get it that perfect cue,

3982
02:57:20,600 --> 02:57:22,010
but you can't get it too close to your 
eyes,

3983
02:57:22,070 --> 02:57:25,010
hence the raccoon look.
But it empowers you.

3984
02:57:25,011 --> 02:57:27,260
It gives you energy and such a great 
supervillain move.

3985
02:57:28,040 --> 02:57:29,630
He just needs it.
Move trump tower,

3986
02:57:30,230 --> 02:57:31,063
inactive volcano,
move trump tower to an Indian burial 

3987
02:57:34,401 --> 02:57:35,234
site,
put a trump tower up right where the 

3988
02:57:36,681 --> 02:57:39,750
Dakota pipeline is being built.
One trump tower and just show the,

3989
02:57:39,910 --> 02:57:44,910
or just show redskins games were wearing
a red hat.

3990
02:57:47,180 --> 02:57:49,970
Make America great again.
What the fuck,

3991
02:57:49,971 --> 02:57:50,900
ma'am?
Hmm.

3992
02:57:51,110 --> 02:57:53,750
Strange Times Change Times,
but beautiful times.

3993
02:57:53,780 --> 02:57:54,613
They're the best times they are.
And the more we realized that the best 

3994
02:57:56,571 --> 02:57:58,220
times,
the more we're going to be okay.

3995
02:57:58,221 --> 02:57:59,270
Like right now.
Yeah.

3996
02:57:59,271 --> 02:58:01,950
It is entirely possible.
We might get hit

3997
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:05,310
by an asteroid the size of China.
It is entirely possible.

3998
02:58:05,311 --> 02:58:09,630
There are out there,
there's giant chunks of the world rather

3999
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:13,500
was at one point time hit with another 
planet that's established.

4000
02:58:13,650 --> 02:58:14,483
That's what they believe.
They believe the moon was created when 

4001
02:58:16,021 --> 02:58:16,854
the earth,
we nearly collided with another fucking 

4002
02:58:19,261 --> 02:58:22,830
planet that did sleek.
It's not happening right now though,

4003
02:58:22,920 --> 02:58:27,920
so right now it's just be nice to each 
other and have some fucking fun.

4004
02:58:29,460 --> 02:58:30,690
Totally.
Let's go champ.

4005
02:58:32,450 --> 02:58:33,051
Yeah,
man.

4006
02:58:33,051 --> 02:58:34,970
If we can always figure out shit to 
worry about,

4007
02:58:34,971 --> 02:58:37,190
we can figure out all of these things to
stress us out.

4008
02:58:37,191 --> 02:58:38,660
It's our job.
It's our relationship.

4009
02:58:38,661 --> 02:58:41,830
It's the fucking media.
If he's long as you enjoy the now,

4010
02:58:41,840 --> 02:58:44,630
you're not going to regret it.
If I go back and talk to my younger self

4011
02:58:44,631 --> 02:58:46,010
like,
hey young Aubrey,

4012
02:58:46,130 --> 02:58:49,610
if I could tell you one fucking thing,
it's to stress less like,

4013
02:58:49,611 --> 02:58:51,080
yeah,
think about the possibilities,

4014
02:58:51,081 --> 02:58:51,914
but then let it go.
Like enjoy your time because all there 

4015
02:58:54,141 --> 02:58:57,440
is is the enjoyment of time.
You know all of these goals you have,

4016
02:58:57,441 --> 02:59:00,980
they're all false summits.
Like enjoy the whole process all the way

4017
02:59:00,981 --> 02:59:01,814
through.
Enjoy to that last moment where the 

4018
02:59:03,321 --> 02:59:06,500
fucking Chinese size asteroid smashes 
into,

4019
02:59:06,501 --> 02:59:10,040
enjoy up to that last minute and you 
won't have any regrets.

4020
02:59:10,070 --> 02:59:11,060
Yeah.
If you can prevent it,

4021
02:59:11,420 --> 02:59:12,740
do that.
But if you can't do anything,

4022
02:59:12,770 --> 02:59:14,330
don't fucking stress.
Relax.

4023
02:59:14,760 --> 02:59:18,210
Yeah.
And then even realize that like goals,

4024
02:59:18,600 --> 02:59:19,433
they actually help you be happy.
As weird as it seems like achieving 

4025
02:59:21,991 --> 02:59:22,824
goals and going after things and showing
yourself that through discipline and 

4026
02:59:26,221 --> 02:59:27,054
focus,
you can achieve these weird creative 

4027
02:59:28,411 --> 02:59:30,780
ventures.
Take things to new places.

4028
02:59:30,910 --> 02:59:32,500
Yeah.
It's the going for the competitor.

4029
02:59:32,560 --> 02:59:34,720
It's the going for the goal.
That's the best part.

4030
02:59:34,721 --> 02:59:38,890
It's not the actual achievement of that 
goal makes you feel suddenly different.

4031
02:59:38,891 --> 02:59:42,340
It's that you're striving for making 
progress and then you hit it and there's

4032
02:59:42,341 --> 02:59:44,140
that.
Of course that satisfaction,

4033
02:59:44,141 --> 02:59:45,990
but then you set another goal.
Yeah.

4034
02:59:46,030 --> 02:59:46,863
You know,
and then you set another goal and just 

4035
02:59:47,441 --> 02:59:49,330
know that you'll constantly be setting 
goals.

4036
02:59:49,331 --> 02:59:52,780
So if at no point you're ever happy,
unless you're achieving the goal,

4037
02:59:52,781 --> 02:59:55,090
you're only going to be happy if 
fractional part of time,

4038
02:59:55,210 --> 02:59:56,043
unless you're with that transformer.
Watch getting his dick sucked over the 

4039
02:59:59,201 --> 03:00:02,700
Atlantic elude.
You knew too.

4040
03:00:03,790 --> 03:00:04,623
He probably has those cheesy limo lights
inside of his jet where they change 

4041
03:00:07,781 --> 03:00:09,520
colors all the time.
It's like purple,

4042
03:00:09,521 --> 03:00:10,810
green,
red,

4043
03:00:10,811 --> 03:00:14,200
yellow.
And he's in there with a bottle of Stoli

4044
03:00:14,650 --> 03:00:18,610
activate an eagle feather,
supervised Agora and Gorge Dick.

4045
03:00:18,730 --> 03:00:22,180
We're just got so much viagara system 
has ears are ringing.

4046
03:00:23,380 --> 03:00:25,630
He hasn't breathe through his nose a 
days.

4047
03:00:27,220 --> 03:00:31,940
He uses coke to open up his nose so that
he can breathe out of his nose while his

4048
03:00:31,941 --> 03:00:35,440
deck as hard as titanium.
Anything else?

4049
03:00:35,830 --> 03:00:37,230
Nope.
Shanice for me.

4050
03:00:37,390 --> 03:00:38,223
Um,
you want to talk about your Iowasca 

4051
03:00:39,371 --> 03:00:41,320
experience or how long would that take?
I mean,

4052
03:00:41,321 --> 03:00:42,154
that's a,
it's a good 15 minute story and fuck it 

4053
03:00:44,501 --> 03:00:46,600
man.
People are driving right now.

4054
03:00:46,601 --> 03:00:47,750
They're like,
keep going,

4055
03:00:47,770 --> 03:00:50,260
keep going.
Oh,

4056
03:00:50,710 --> 03:00:51,311
let's,
let's,

4057
03:00:51,311 --> 03:00:52,144
let's set this up.

4058
03:00:52,890 --> 03:00:53,250
Okay.

4059
03:00:53,250 --> 03:00:56,100
Last time I talked to you after you had 
an Iowasca experience,

4060
03:00:56,101 --> 03:00:56,760
you were like,
dude,

4061
03:00:56,760 --> 03:00:58,140
I think I'm done.
Yeah,

4062
03:00:58,230 --> 03:00:59,620
I think I'm done.
Yeah.

4063
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:00,280
It almost

4064
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:01,001
done.
He's like,

4065
03:01:01,001 --> 03:01:02,650
I don't,
I think I'm good.

4066
03:01:02,800 --> 03:01:04,660
Maybe some little dmt trips here and 
there,

4067
03:01:04,661 --> 03:01:08,920
but I think I'm done.
And then next thing I know you're off to

4068
03:01:08,921 --> 03:01:10,900
the fucking jungle again.
Let's go champ.

4069
03:01:12,180 --> 03:01:14,090
Exactly.
That's called change.

4070
03:01:14,820 --> 03:01:15,960
What happened?
Well,

4071
03:01:16,140 --> 03:01:16,973
one of the things that I enjoy is taking
people who haven't experienced it and 

4072
03:01:20,040 --> 03:01:20,873
going there with them going like,
there's no better rite of passage 

4073
03:01:23,791 --> 03:01:24,624
bonding experience.
So this time I just brought all of my 

4074
03:01:26,131 --> 03:01:29,010
homies,
like everybody in my inner circle that I

4075
03:01:29,011 --> 03:01:30,840
love that wanting to go,
you know,

4076
03:01:30,841 --> 03:01:32,760
we all went.
And um,

4077
03:01:32,761 --> 03:01:36,000
so for me it's a lot about that kind of 
rite of passage experience.

4078
03:01:36,001 --> 03:01:36,834
I still really like and appreciate the 
plants and I learned a ton and I 

4079
03:01:38,970 --> 03:01:43,230
sometimes underestimate how much more I 
have to learn from the plants for sure.

4080
03:01:43,460 --> 03:01:45,030
I don't think so.
It was a combination of that.

4081
03:01:45,350 --> 03:01:46,770
Um,
so anyway was set up this trip.

4082
03:01:46,800 --> 03:01:49,710
Everybody I know we're going to do Iosco
we're meeting Don Howard,

4083
03:01:49,980 --> 03:01:50,641
who's,
you know,

4084
03:01:50,641 --> 03:01:52,560
we've done two documentaries with him 
now.

4085
03:01:52,590 --> 03:01:55,830
Latest Iowasca documentary is with him 
as well.

4086
03:01:56,160 --> 03:01:57,600
Awesome guy.
He's like Gandalf,

4087
03:01:57,601 --> 03:01:59,040
the white wizard.
So we're setting that up,

4088
03:01:59,490 --> 03:02:01,980
but I knew this one was going to get 
interesting because a month,

4089
03:02:02,260 --> 03:02:04,230
about a month before,
sometime in August,

4090
03:02:04,530 --> 03:02:06,390
I wake up in the middle of the night,
we're going in September.

4091
03:02:06,391 --> 03:02:08,790
I wake up in the middle of the night and
um,

4092
03:02:08,820 --> 03:02:13,650
from a dream and in this dream I look 
over and to my left side,

4093
03:02:13,651 --> 03:02:14,484
I see this demon head and this gnarly 
looking demon head nosferatu looking 

4094
03:02:18,871 --> 03:02:19,704
thing.
And he was just looking away and in my 

4095
03:02:21,991 --> 03:02:23,220
dream,
he looks at me,

4096
03:02:23,390 --> 03:02:25,260
it's fairs at me dead in the eye and 
goes,

4097
03:02:25,261 --> 03:02:28,710
I'm going to kill you on September 23rd.
Oh Shit.

4098
03:02:28,770 --> 03:02:30,810
Like super fucking specific,
right?

4099
03:02:31,620 --> 03:02:33,600
So I wake up and I'm a little freaked 
out.

4100
03:02:33,601 --> 03:02:34,201
I was like,
damn,

4101
03:02:34,201 --> 03:02:35,820
that was specific.
So I go to my,

4102
03:02:35,821 --> 03:02:38,100
and I knew my Peru trip was over that 
time.

4103
03:02:38,400 --> 03:02:39,233
I go to the calendar of events,
the itinerary and that night is the 

4104
03:02:42,480 --> 03:02:43,313
night we're drinking IOWASCA for the 
first time cause we were doing what 

4105
03:02:44,981 --> 03:02:45,690
Chuma afterwards.

4106
03:02:45,690 --> 03:02:48,170
So September 23rd was the night we're 
doing our WASCO.

4107
03:02:48,180 --> 03:02:50,040
And so do you start thinking your mind 
was fucking with you?

4108
03:02:50,340 --> 03:02:51,173
Like for sure.
Like this is just your setting yourself 

4109
03:02:53,251 --> 03:02:55,020
up for a fall.
Yeah,

4110
03:02:55,570 --> 03:02:57,450
I played out all the scenarios.
Right.

4111
03:02:57,780 --> 03:03:00,570
And I'd try to like what was that?
Maybe it was a metaphor.

4112
03:03:00,571 --> 03:03:02,070
Maybe.
Hopefully it wasn't for real.

4113
03:03:02,071 --> 03:03:03,540
Hopefully you know,
but,

4114
03:03:03,660 --> 03:03:04,493
and you know I,
maybe I might've known that date in my 

4115
03:03:06,871 --> 03:03:07,704
head,
so I'm not trying to think this is 

4116
03:03:08,671 --> 03:03:10,710
supernatural.
It's all kind of metaphor.

4117
03:03:10,711 --> 03:03:13,830
But it was very specific.
So by the time we get out there,

4118
03:03:14,160 --> 03:03:16,050
I knew that I had this feeling like,
man,

4119
03:03:16,051 --> 03:03:16,884
some shit's going to come up here.
Cause that was like something's in my 

4120
03:03:19,051 --> 03:03:21,750
psyche that's incredibly specific about 
this.

4121
03:03:22,590 --> 03:03:23,423
So we're going into ceremony.
And one thing I like to do to prepare 

4122
03:03:26,220 --> 03:03:28,410
for ceremony,
and I do this for the whole group,

4123
03:03:28,440 --> 03:03:31,230
is they do a meditation where it anchors
them to their consciousness.

4124
03:03:31,231 --> 03:03:32,790
And I put that consciousness in their 
heart,

4125
03:03:33,180 --> 03:03:34,013
right?
So cause the head can get really 

4126
03:03:34,861 --> 03:03:38,700
squirrely and you can get lost in belief
in different ideas and thoughts.

4127
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,070
And if you identify yourself as 
consciousness,

4128
03:03:41,071 --> 03:03:41,904
which I,
I tell them to symbolize is a brilliant 

4129
03:03:44,011 --> 03:03:47,940
piece of white light in your heart and 
you symbolize that and you imagine that,

4130
03:03:48,540 --> 03:03:49,980
that there,
that's an anchor.

4131
03:03:50,010 --> 03:03:51,990
That's like your anchor,
that's your anchor to home.

4132
03:03:51,991 --> 03:03:53,070
And then,
you know,

4133
03:03:53,071 --> 03:03:54,180
I,
I talked to him how,

4134
03:03:54,240 --> 03:03:57,770
when you imagine that there,
then you can imagine it actually showing

4135
03:03:57,771 --> 03:03:58,520
up.
Atomically

4136
03:03:58,520 --> 03:04:00,320
like in,
in the rules of quantum physics,

4137
03:04:00,321 --> 03:04:01,910
the observer effect,
you observe it,

4138
03:04:02,120 --> 03:04:02,953
then it's connected to yourself,
all yourselves connected to all things 

4139
03:04:05,151 --> 03:04:06,840
in space,
connected to the,

4140
03:04:06,841 --> 03:04:09,830
you know,
to the one source of consciousness,

4141
03:04:10,040 --> 03:04:11,630
the collective consciousness,
that thing.

4142
03:04:11,870 --> 03:04:14,600
And it just kind of anchors you and 
keeps you in this feeling of safe.

4143
03:04:14,601 --> 03:04:16,850
So whatever's squirly things happening 
in your mind,

4144
03:04:17,210 --> 03:04:20,300
you do that.
But this is important for the story that

4145
03:04:20,301 --> 03:04:21,290
I'm,
that I'm setting up.

4146
03:04:21,291 --> 03:04:23,630
Cause you know,
so I do that meditation and that's where

4147
03:04:23,631 --> 03:04:26,750
I go into the psychedelic experiences,
anchored to my heart,

4148
03:04:26,751 --> 03:04:30,260
connected to the cosmos,
connected to the infinite through that.

4149
03:04:30,261 --> 03:04:33,560
And it's a very kind of comforting,
comforting meditation to do.

4150
03:04:34,340 --> 03:04:35,173
So I'm going through and um,
I take the medicine and right off the 

4151
03:04:38,241 --> 03:04:40,050
bat it's like super,
you know,

4152
03:04:40,051 --> 03:04:40,884
it's super chill.
Like I'm seeing beautiful scenes like 

4153
03:04:42,771 --> 03:04:44,690
flowers,
these flowers of light.

4154
03:04:45,050 --> 03:04:47,090
And I get this message like,
hey man,

4155
03:04:47,091 --> 03:04:47,590
it's this,
this,

4156
03:04:47,590 --> 03:04:48,920
this one's going to be easy.
And I was like,

4157
03:04:48,950 --> 03:04:49,311
oh,
okay,

4158
03:04:49,311 --> 03:04:50,450
cool.
And is like,

4159
03:04:50,451 --> 03:04:51,284
we're just going to fix a few things.
So I felt like what it feels like all 

4160
03:04:54,561 --> 03:04:56,390
these little doctors of light,
the doctor,

4161
03:04:56,400 --> 03:04:57,021
Cheetos,
you know,

4162
03:04:57,021 --> 03:04:57,854
these little light beings,
good going through my body and start 

4163
03:05:00,861 --> 03:05:01,694
fixing little different areas,
fixing little parts in my head and 

4164
03:05:04,611 --> 03:05:05,444
they're fixing little parts here.
And meanwhile my mind is being 

4165
03:05:06,831 --> 03:05:09,740
distracted with flowers and butterflies 
and it's super chill.

4166
03:05:09,920 --> 03:05:10,753
The only memorable vision I had was I go
to this shrine in this jungle and I see 

4167
03:05:14,481 --> 03:05:15,314
this giant monkey human hybrid that's 
super happy and it's like they're just 

4168
03:05:21,081 --> 03:05:24,860
butterflies and everything going around.
And then in scripted in stone it says we

4169
03:05:24,861 --> 03:05:27,020
are the pleasure monkeys and that's what
have been,

4170
03:05:27,030 --> 03:05:27,863
have been using that word today and has 
this like really cool thing like Oh 

4171
03:05:30,261 --> 03:05:31,550
yeah,
we are pleasure monkeys,

4172
03:05:31,551 --> 03:05:34,340
we're here to enjoy all of the best shit
that we can.

4173
03:05:34,340 --> 03:05:36,330
And I start thinking about,
you know,

4174
03:05:36,380 --> 03:05:40,550
the foods and the people and the 
camaraderie and everything around me.

4175
03:05:40,820 --> 03:05:41,653
Super Positive.
Meanwhile the light's going through my 

4176
03:05:42,891 --> 03:05:47,690
body and fixing it and then you know,
as this really idyllic thing and I think

4177
03:05:47,930 --> 03:05:49,340
we're at an hour and a half and I'm 
like,

4178
03:05:49,341 --> 03:05:50,360
fucking,
we're good.

4179
03:05:50,450 --> 03:05:51,283
Like whatever.
This demon was not going to worry about 

4180
03:05:53,151 --> 03:05:53,984
it.
It's fine.

4181
03:05:54,170 --> 03:05:58,970
And then right to my left,
I see this gnarly looking Gollum,

4182
03:05:58,971 --> 03:06:03,971
Lord of the Rings Looking fucking my 
precious knows fraud to demon guy.

4183
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:08,720
And he looks at me and,
and I was like,

4184
03:06:08,930 --> 03:06:09,763
you know,
one of the practices that I have is 

4185
03:06:10,731 --> 03:06:12,980
anchoring to that point in my heart.
You know,

4186
03:06:12,981 --> 03:06:13,850
I,
I,

4187
03:06:14,120 --> 03:06:14,953
you know,
I encourage the feeling of 

4188
03:06:15,741 --> 03:06:17,630
invincibility.
Like he can't be harmed,

4189
03:06:17,690 --> 03:06:19,100
you know,
this is your consciousness.

4190
03:06:19,101 --> 03:06:21,320
It's this peace in your heart.
It can't be harmed.

4191
03:06:21,321 --> 03:06:24,230
And I see this demon and it looks at me 
and then it jumps,

4192
03:06:24,290 --> 03:06:26,570
jumps towards me and it starts biting my
neck.

4193
03:06:26,630 --> 03:06:27,680
Whoa.
In my vision.

4194
03:06:27,681 --> 03:06:28,514
Right?
So it's gnarly looking demon is biting 

4195
03:06:30,580 --> 03:06:32,450
my vision.
No,

4196
03:06:32,630 --> 03:06:33,463
it's all like,
it's all in this like a movie of me 

4197
03:06:34,851 --> 03:06:35,930
being played out.
Right.

4198
03:06:36,430 --> 03:06:39,500
I think you just going with,
but the emotion ratchet it up,

4199
03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:41,030
right?
So at this point,

4200
03:06:41,090 --> 03:06:42,740
you know,
I know it's eating in my,

4201
03:06:42,950 --> 03:06:44,570
you know,
in that vision,

4202
03:06:44,571 --> 03:06:45,404
it's eating through my neck and I see 
what it's aim is and it's aiming to eat 

4203
03:06:48,651 --> 03:06:51,530
through my neck and eat that thing in my
heart.

4204
03:06:51,800 --> 03:06:55,100
The white light in my heart that I've 
been meditating about.

4205
03:06:55,110 --> 03:06:57,050
Like that's what it wants.
So in,

4206
03:06:57,110 --> 03:07:00,210
in what I thought was this like heroic 
act of invincibility,

4207
03:07:00,600 --> 03:07:02,490
I was like,
go ahead man,

4208
03:07:02,520 --> 03:07:03,690
you want that thing?
Go ahead.

4209
03:07:03,720 --> 03:07:05,520
Eat all the way through me.
Get that thing,

4210
03:07:05,730 --> 03:07:07,140
it's fine.
You know?

4211
03:07:07,440 --> 03:07:08,273
Instead of,
cause I've learned in a lot of these 

4212
03:07:09,301 --> 03:07:11,190
practices,
the more you resist these things,

4213
03:07:11,490 --> 03:07:14,880
the more aggressive they become and the 
harder you just get in this,

4214
03:07:15,120 --> 03:07:15,720
this dance.

4215
03:07:15,720 --> 03:07:18,900
So it was more you surrender generally 
the better off you are.

4216
03:07:18,901 --> 03:07:20,130
So it's like,
oh you want to eat that thing,

4217
03:07:20,131 --> 03:07:23,190
go for it.
So it goes through each through my neck,

4218
03:07:23,220 --> 03:07:24,053
through my chest,
and it grabs a hold of that piece of 

4219
03:07:26,701 --> 03:07:28,830
white light in my heart,
snatches it.

4220
03:07:29,250 --> 03:07:32,400
And right at that moment I've never felt
more free.

4221
03:07:32,410 --> 03:07:33,243
I feel like I got shot with a bullet.
Like I felt like I went dead completely 

4222
03:07:37,110 --> 03:07:42,030
dead and fear just shot through my 
entire body and I was like,

4223
03:07:42,120 --> 03:07:45,120
Oh fuck,
I just gave this demon my consciousness.

4224
03:07:45,121 --> 03:07:47,610
I just gave this team in my soul and I 
let them have it.

4225
03:07:47,611 --> 03:07:49,290
It's like all the fucking vampire 
movies,

4226
03:07:49,291 --> 03:07:51,240
like they can't come in unless you give 
them permission,

4227
03:07:51,241 --> 03:07:53,730
then you give them permission and all of
these fucking thoughts are going through

4228
03:07:53,731 --> 03:07:55,920
my head.
And meanwhile I felt completely dead,

4229
03:07:56,010 --> 03:07:57,360
like hollow from the inside.

4230
03:07:57,360 --> 03:07:58,193
Fear was that like 1000% and then the 
eco rows of the sham and start getting 

4231
03:08:01,801 --> 03:08:02,760
more intense.
And I'm like,

4232
03:08:03,300 --> 03:08:04,410
Holy Shit,
I'm fucked.

4233
03:08:04,440 --> 03:08:07,800
So I started negotiating with this 
nosferatu demon guy and I was like,

4234
03:08:07,801 --> 03:08:09,750
man,
I'd really like to get my piece back.

4235
03:08:09,751 --> 03:08:11,430
Like you mind giving it back.
Like,

4236
03:08:11,730 --> 03:08:12,541
you know,
it's all good.

4237
03:08:12,541 --> 03:08:14,130
I understand you have your place,
you know,

4238
03:08:14,131 --> 03:08:16,410
for polarity to exist,
there needs to be the dark that needs to

4239
03:08:16,411 --> 03:08:17,430
be the light,
you know,

4240
03:08:17,431 --> 03:08:19,080
it's all good man.
We're all on the same team.

4241
03:08:19,081 --> 03:08:20,340
Ultimately we're all,
you know,

4242
03:08:20,570 --> 03:08:22,650
consciousness and the cosmos,
he's having none of it.

4243
03:08:22,920 --> 03:08:23,731
Right.
And then finally,

4244
03:08:23,731 --> 03:08:25,530
is he like he's,
yeah,

4245
03:08:25,531 --> 03:08:26,364
he's sometimes talking back and 
sometimes just kind of like mocking me 

4246
03:08:28,861 --> 03:08:31,110
really like kind of laughing and then he
goes,

4247
03:08:31,140 --> 03:08:33,060
here you go.
And it gives me something,

4248
03:08:33,300 --> 03:08:35,370
and I greedily like a,
like a hungry,

4249
03:08:35,520 --> 03:08:37,110
like a hungry child,
like grab it.

4250
03:08:37,350 --> 03:08:40,320
And I stuffed it in my heart and it was 
dead piece of rock,

4251
03:08:40,321 --> 03:08:41,154
like a dead stone.
And it's just this demons just laughing 

4252
03:08:43,021 --> 03:08:43,854
at me.
Now I have your heart and watch where 

4253
03:08:46,201 --> 03:08:47,034
I'm going.
And he goes and he takes it and I'm 

4254
03:08:48,601 --> 03:08:49,960
following him and he,
and you know,

4255
03:08:49,980 --> 03:08:50,813
through this kind of like wormhole thing
and he takes it and I see who he's 

4256
03:08:54,061 --> 03:08:56,820
giving it to and then I go,
oh fuck.

4257
03:08:56,970 --> 03:09:00,330
Because he's giving it to the demon of 
all demons.

4258
03:09:00,331 --> 03:09:02,370
And this is very archetypical and I'm 
not religious,

4259
03:09:02,371 --> 03:09:04,620
but these archetypes are coming through 
in this kind of,

4260
03:09:05,120 --> 03:09:06,390
you know,
demon,

4261
03:09:06,490 --> 03:09:08,400
demon,
Kibo type of sense.

4262
03:09:08,401 --> 03:09:10,740
But anyways,
this demon that he gives it to,

4263
03:09:10,770 --> 03:09:15,420
I can only call the world crusher 
because literally he's of the size where

4264
03:09:15,421 --> 03:09:20,160
I'm seeing him hold planets and crushing
them into dust in his hands.

4265
03:09:20,310 --> 03:09:24,930
And he's just moving the cosmos.
These giant horns made of this deep,

4266
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:25,793
dark black and red smoke and just 
laughing in the ecstasy of destruction 

4267
03:09:30,721 --> 03:09:31,554
as he takes galaxies and he rips them 
apart like the ultimate black hole of 

4268
03:09:35,281 --> 03:09:37,080
destruction and evil.
And I go,

4269
03:09:37,081 --> 03:09:40,560
fuck,
like that guy's got my heart piece now.

4270
03:09:40,750 --> 03:09:43,170
I like the little demon gave it to that 
thing.

4271
03:09:43,380 --> 03:09:45,030
So I'm thinking like,
what the fuck do I do?

4272
03:09:45,031 --> 03:09:47,850
I can't even communicate with his demon 
world crusher.

4273
03:09:47,880 --> 03:09:50,640
Like there's no way,
there's no way I can even talk to him.

4274
03:09:50,641 --> 03:09:51,810
He's too big.
So I try to like,

4275
03:09:51,811 --> 03:09:53,820
well maybe I can blow myself,
you know,

4276
03:09:53,840 --> 03:09:56,650
maybe I can get bigger.
I'm thinking like video game style,

4277
03:09:56,680 --> 03:09:57,513
like that's going to work.
Like maybe if I fucking get bigger than 

4278
03:09:59,621 --> 03:10:02,530
we can talk and negotiate and I'll be on
his level.

4279
03:10:02,890 --> 03:10:03,940
Totally doesn't work.

4280
03:10:03,970 --> 03:10:07,330
I can't get even near the size of him 
and my vision.

4281
03:10:08,050 --> 03:10:09,700
So I'm like,
fuck,

4282
03:10:09,701 --> 03:10:12,190
what the fuck do I do?
Like what am I going to fucking do here?

4283
03:10:12,550 --> 03:10:15,010
And,
and I get the idea,

4284
03:10:15,011 --> 03:10:15,844
I was like,
man,

4285
03:10:16,060 --> 03:10:18,070
I can't fight this thing.
There's no way.

4286
03:10:18,340 --> 03:10:20,740
But you know,
understanding that again,

4287
03:10:20,741 --> 03:10:23,890
that the consciousness in the cosmos 
needs dark and light.

4288
03:10:24,190 --> 03:10:27,700
I understand the value of the polarity 
of that something that dark,

4289
03:10:27,960 --> 03:10:29,680
you know,
I understand that that's necessary.

4290
03:10:29,950 --> 03:10:30,490
It's like,
man,

4291
03:10:30,490 --> 03:10:35,320
I got to send this thing love.
So I go and I imagine floating up to its

4292
03:10:35,321 --> 03:10:39,730
head and right between its eyes,
I kissed him on the forehead and it's,

4293
03:10:39,731 --> 03:10:44,710
I know it sounds weird and for a moment 
I see his eyes go google the eyes,

4294
03:10:44,711 --> 03:10:47,750
like the Emoji heart thing where the 
heart's appeared,

4295
03:10:48,500 --> 03:10:51,250
crushers eyes.
And it was really kind of cartoony.

4296
03:10:51,280 --> 03:10:54,660
And um,
for that moment he relinquishes and he's

4297
03:10:54,670 --> 03:10:56,050
like,
you know,

4298
03:10:56,470 --> 03:10:58,450
I can give this back to you,
but we never took it.

4299
03:10:58,570 --> 03:11:00,130
No one can take that piece of your 
heart.

4300
03:11:00,131 --> 03:11:01,410
It's yours.
You know,

4301
03:11:01,450 --> 03:11:03,970
it's impossible to steal unless you 
believe it can steal.

4302
03:11:03,971 --> 03:11:06,220
And it was just like beautiful wisdom.
And I was like,

4303
03:11:06,250 --> 03:11:07,540
oh my God,
thank God.

4304
03:11:07,900 --> 03:11:10,090
But I was still like shaken up by that,
you know,

4305
03:11:10,091 --> 03:11:12,610
I was still kind of fucked up,
but that move worked.

4306
03:11:12,611 --> 03:11:15,170
And in that moment where his eyes were 
all googly hard,

4307
03:11:15,171 --> 03:11:15,671
she was like,
man,

4308
03:11:15,671 --> 03:11:16,900
we can't take that from you.
That's your,

4309
03:11:16,910 --> 03:11:17,743
so I had this renewed sense of 
confidence and so I started kind of 

4310
03:11:20,831 --> 03:11:21,664
going,
it was kind of more peaceful then it 

4311
03:11:23,050 --> 03:11:24,220
grows,
seem to be falling.

4312
03:11:24,221 --> 03:11:25,054
My trip died down.
I'm going through about all the 

4313
03:11:26,951 --> 03:11:29,030
relations in my life and the different,
you know,

4314
03:11:29,170 --> 03:11:32,140
kind of doing the general work you do on
Iowasca and I get to,

4315
03:11:32,500 --> 03:11:33,333
I'm a member of my family who's really 
suffering from some mental illness is 

4316
03:11:37,240 --> 03:11:39,100
really dark,
like a dark mental illness.

4317
03:11:39,640 --> 03:11:41,890
And I think that now maybe the world 
crusher,

4318
03:11:42,060 --> 03:11:42,893
my friend.
So I get the feeling of the world 

4319
03:11:44,621 --> 03:11:47,380
crusher has that element of darkness is 
in him.

4320
03:11:47,950 --> 03:11:52,950
So I think in my imagination and,
and kind of call back on that,

4321
03:11:53,080 --> 03:11:53,913
on that being,
and immediately it comes up but in a 

4322
03:11:55,781 --> 03:11:59,170
different shape,
like a giant fucking sea serpent.

4323
03:11:59,171 --> 03:12:01,810
And it's wrapping these tentacles around
my body,

4324
03:12:01,811 --> 03:12:04,840
like a Leviathan from the deep and,
and,

4325
03:12:04,960 --> 03:12:06,040
and I'm like,
whoa.

4326
03:12:06,130 --> 03:12:07,420
I was like,
um,

4327
03:12:07,421 --> 03:12:09,910
what do you think about maybe letting 
you know this,

4328
03:12:09,940 --> 03:12:12,130
this family member,
what do you think about letting him go?

4329
03:12:12,580 --> 03:12:14,890
And he's like,
you want his soul?

4330
03:12:14,891 --> 03:12:19,120
I'll make a trade your soul for his.
And I was like,

4331
03:12:19,121 --> 03:12:20,320
fuck,
fuck that.

4332
03:12:20,500 --> 03:12:21,370
Fuck that.
Right.

4333
03:12:21,371 --> 03:12:23,620
So,
so at that point I was like,

4334
03:12:23,621 --> 03:12:25,720
man.
And then I was like,

4335
03:12:25,721 --> 03:12:26,780
I don't think I can make that trade.

4336
03:12:26,780 --> 03:12:29,380
He's like cower.
And you wouldn't do that for someone you

4337
03:12:29,381 --> 03:12:30,640
love.
You're a coward.

4338
03:12:30,790 --> 03:12:33,010
I thought you said you were invincible 
and starts mocking me.

4339
03:12:33,190 --> 03:12:36,220
Clearly not my homie.
Like clearly take the world crashed,

4340
03:12:36,270 --> 03:12:39,340
takes his job seriously.
So eventually I have to go like,

4341
03:12:39,341 --> 03:12:40,780
you know what,
that's between you and him.

4342
03:12:40,810 --> 03:12:45,250
I can't step in there like there's 
nothing that I can do for you.

4343
03:12:45,251 --> 03:12:47,170
So I just had to let it go and I let 
them go.

4344
03:12:47,171 --> 03:12:49,390
Not Making that proverbial deal.
And again,

4345
03:12:49,391 --> 03:12:51,040
I don't think this is like really 
happening.

4346
03:12:51,050 --> 03:12:52,490
This could just be an archetype,
right?

4347
03:12:52,570 --> 03:12:54,530
Of course.
But so anyways,

4348
03:12:54,560 --> 03:12:56,120
from there I was like,
fuck man,

4349
03:12:56,121 --> 03:12:57,770
this is turned super dark.
Like,

4350
03:12:57,771 --> 03:13:00,650
can I get some help?
Like in since the archetype was demons,

4351
03:13:00,651 --> 03:13:02,690
I was like,
can I get a Jesus in here?

4352
03:13:02,691 --> 03:13:06,560
Something like some kind of light and 
nothing light would come.

4353
03:13:06,560 --> 03:13:07,393
Although I did get a cool vision of like
Jesus meeting the world crusher and I 

4354
03:13:10,731 --> 03:13:11,301
was like,
Ooh,

4355
03:13:11,301 --> 03:13:12,134
this is going to be squared like 
showdown UFC ultimate Jesus versus the 

4356
03:13:15,471 --> 03:13:16,304
world crusher.
And immediately they turned super gay 

4357
03:13:18,680 --> 03:13:21,440
and they started making out with each 
other and having sex.

4358
03:13:21,441 --> 03:13:22,274
Jesus in the world crusher started like 
having sex with each other and it was 

4359
03:13:26,091 --> 03:13:26,924
so,
it was the wildest vision cause it was 

4360
03:13:28,431 --> 03:13:32,480
this like the ultimate love affair,
like the two polarities of the cosmos,

4361
03:13:32,481 --> 03:13:35,420
like all of the love and forgiveness and
all of the power.

4362
03:13:35,421 --> 03:13:39,110
Who was the destruction.
The pack in darkness was the top,

4363
03:13:39,130 --> 03:13:41,660
the doctor's bag of Jesus.
Jesus would turn,

4364
03:13:41,661 --> 03:13:43,730
he was man woman.
It was like super.

4365
03:13:43,850 --> 03:13:44,683
He could be whatever he wanted,
but they were dancing in this like 

4366
03:13:46,820 --> 03:13:49,670
passionate love affair,
which was like all creation.

4367
03:13:49,720 --> 03:13:52,750
So Jesus became man and woman,
Jesus man,

4368
03:13:52,760 --> 03:13:53,240
woman.

4369
03:13:53,240 --> 03:13:54,073
He was just,
it was just like love versus power and 

4370
03:13:56,721 --> 03:13:57,554
darken and destruction.
Creation versus structured like the two 

4371
03:13:59,751 --> 03:14:04,640
polarities dancing but expressed as the 
world crusher is devil like creature.

4372
03:14:04,641 --> 03:14:06,020
And then Jesus,
you know,

4373
03:14:06,021 --> 03:14:09,440
which started as kind of Jesusy and then
went and a woman and then went into man,

4374
03:14:09,740 --> 03:14:11,900
whatever it was,
at least gave me a chuckle.

4375
03:14:12,200 --> 03:14:16,190
And it was like a moment of like relief 
from this really fucking heavy trip.

4376
03:14:16,790 --> 03:14:17,623
But I still wasn't getting any personal 
interaction from anything on the light 

4377
03:14:19,791 --> 03:14:20,720
side,
you know?

4378
03:14:21,020 --> 03:14:23,270
And so I'm still like kind of a little 
shaken up,

4379
03:14:23,271 --> 03:14:24,590
especially after,
you know,

4380
03:14:24,620 --> 03:14:27,380
the world crusher called me a coward and
I couldn't help you know,

4381
03:14:27,470 --> 03:14:29,930
this person in my family and it's like,
fuck.

4382
03:14:30,260 --> 03:14:32,120
Um,
so then I see this,

4383
03:14:32,350 --> 03:14:34,340
I keep trying to reach out to like the 
helpers,

4384
03:14:34,341 --> 03:14:38,840
like something from the light and I get 
this very faint message.

4385
03:14:38,900 --> 03:14:39,733
You know,
sometimes the visions are super clear 

4386
03:14:40,491 --> 03:14:42,030
and sometimes they're faint.
It feels like you're,

4387
03:14:42,230 --> 03:14:44,390
you're kind of reaching for it.
But I'll go with that.

4388
03:14:44,391 --> 03:14:46,850
I'll use my imagination is a bridge,
so I kind of go with it.

4389
03:14:47,300 --> 03:14:48,133
It's like,
here we have this thing for you and put 

4390
03:14:50,391 --> 03:14:52,070
it in your heart.
It'll give you extra,

4391
03:14:52,160 --> 03:14:54,020
you know,
it'll be what you're looking for.

4392
03:14:54,021 --> 03:14:56,740
And is this brilliant?
Ruby like redstone,

4393
03:14:57,210 --> 03:14:58,250
right?
It's brilliant.

4394
03:14:58,251 --> 03:14:59,270
Ruby stone.
And I was like,

4395
03:14:59,330 --> 03:15:00,470
Oh wow,
that's beautiful.

4396
03:15:00,471 --> 03:15:03,350
Like I always imagined the thing in my 
heart being white but red.

4397
03:15:03,351 --> 03:15:04,184
All right,
it's cool.

4398
03:15:04,640 --> 03:15:05,473
I put it in my chest and then instantly 
I could feel myself getting this like 

4399
03:15:09,080 --> 03:15:13,070
hunger for power and feeling like the 
world crusher,

4400
03:15:13,100 --> 03:15:16,550
like I wanted to destroy and manipulate 
and I was like,

4401
03:15:16,910 --> 03:15:18,830
Oh shit,
that's not the thing.

4402
03:15:19,300 --> 03:15:20,091
You know,
that's not,

4403
03:15:20,091 --> 03:15:22,700
that wasn't a real gift that was getting
tricked again.

4404
03:15:23,060 --> 03:15:23,893
So I pull this thing out of my heart and
for sure like I can just feel the evil 

4405
03:15:27,020 --> 03:15:28,730
emanating from it,
right?

4406
03:15:28,731 --> 03:15:31,290
And I can hear the distant laughter,
the world crusher,

4407
03:15:31,300 --> 03:15:32,780
like,
ha ha ha fooled you again.

4408
03:15:32,781 --> 03:15:33,614
You accepted this stone.
And so I have this ruby stone in my 

4409
03:15:36,231 --> 03:15:37,280
vision.
I'm like,

4410
03:15:37,281 --> 03:15:39,080
what the fuck am I going to do with 
this?

4411
03:15:39,230 --> 03:15:41,180
All right,
so I have this place that I've developed

4412
03:15:41,181 --> 03:15:42,710
in my meditation.
It's like a little hat.

4413
03:15:42,740 --> 03:15:44,030
It's like my happy place,
right?

4414
03:15:44,170 --> 03:15:46,400
It's place.
I go and I imagine it in my mind,

4415
03:15:46,401 --> 03:15:47,480
it's like my happy place.
So I was like,

4416
03:15:47,481 --> 03:15:48,314
all right,
I'm gonna put my stone in my place and 

4417
03:15:49,681 --> 03:15:52,080
I'm gonna leave it there in my,
in my vision.

4418
03:15:52,410 --> 03:15:53,243
Why put it there and the happy place and
it turns to fucking like swamp and bog 

4419
03:15:56,881 --> 03:15:57,990
and everything.

4420
03:15:58,020 --> 03:16:01,680
All the trees are withering like you see
in one of those fantasy movies where the

4421
03:16:01,681 --> 03:16:05,260
darkness anchors into a place and all 
the life dies around.

4422
03:16:05,261 --> 03:16:06,630
And I was like,
fuck man,

4423
03:16:06,631 --> 03:16:08,520
I can't put it there.
It's going to destroy this,

4424
03:16:08,810 --> 03:16:09,643
this world I created.
It's like I bring it back and I was 

4425
03:16:11,701 --> 03:16:12,810
like,
I hear this voice,

4426
03:16:12,811 --> 03:16:14,460
like just put it in your heart.
You can hold it.

4427
03:16:14,500 --> 03:16:16,020
You're strong enough to hold it.
So like,

4428
03:16:16,021 --> 03:16:16,770
okay,
yeah,

4429
03:16:16,770 --> 03:16:18,420
maybe my heart is the only place I can 
put it.

4430
03:16:18,421 --> 03:16:21,000
It's the only way it's gonna be safe.
Put it back in there.

4431
03:16:21,360 --> 03:16:23,670
Bad idea.
Obviously that was another trick.

4432
03:16:23,970 --> 03:16:24,803
But I'm really getting shaken here 
because I keep getting fucking tricked 

4433
03:16:27,600 --> 03:16:28,433
and I keep not knowing what my mind is 
telling me that's helpful or whether 

4434
03:16:30,961 --> 03:16:31,794
it's coming from something else.
So eventually I would like move it out 

4435
03:16:34,891 --> 03:16:37,020
of my body and I'm looking at it,
I was like,

4436
03:16:37,650 --> 03:16:38,040
fuck.

4437
03:16:38,040 --> 03:16:38,873
The only way that I can get rid of this 
is to dissolve it evenly across the 

4438
03:16:42,121 --> 03:16:44,730
entire spectrum of creation.
Right?

4439
03:16:45,030 --> 03:16:49,110
Take this and dissolve it into the all 
so that the entire game,

4440
03:16:49,140 --> 03:16:50,580
all of good,
all of bad,

4441
03:16:50,610 --> 03:16:51,443
everything can hold this amount of evil.
It's too concentrated for any one thing 

4442
03:16:54,751 --> 03:16:56,400
to hold.
I got to dissolve it.

4443
03:16:56,880 --> 03:16:59,370
And I tried that move with my 
imagination and it worked.

4444
03:16:59,730 --> 03:17:01,740
Boom.
And the red stone dissolves.

4445
03:17:01,741 --> 03:17:04,620
And then all of creation holds that 
darkness and that power.

4446
03:17:05,310 --> 03:17:09,030
And I'm sitting there and I just,
at this point just fucking surrender.

4447
03:17:09,060 --> 03:17:11,610
Like I've just been totally getting my 
ass kicked,

4448
03:17:11,820 --> 03:17:13,800
you know,
for the majority of this trip.

4449
03:17:14,130 --> 03:17:16,080
And especially just having been tricked 
and,

4450
03:17:16,450 --> 03:17:18,930
and I'm just kind of like in a state of 
surrender.

4451
03:17:19,140 --> 03:17:23,910
And at that point I feel like kind of 
like iron man style,

4452
03:17:24,090 --> 03:17:24,923
I feel this like breastplate,
like come slap onto my chest and it has 

4453
03:17:27,991 --> 03:17:30,360
this really beautiful fire opal stone.

4454
03:17:30,600 --> 03:17:34,080
And this thing is helmet come on,
my head pink and his helmet comes and it

4455
03:17:34,081 --> 03:17:38,520
has this other brilliant white light and
I feel wings shoot out from my back.

4456
03:17:38,700 --> 03:17:40,830
Right.
And it's obviously,

4457
03:17:40,831 --> 03:17:41,380
it's,
I lost,

4458
03:17:41,380 --> 03:17:43,220
it's shit's crazy.
And,

4459
03:17:43,350 --> 03:17:47,820
and I'm flying in the air and there's a 
bunch of like eagles and other birds and

4460
03:17:47,821 --> 03:17:52,800
it's all like peaceful and all good.
And it was like all of the allies,

4461
03:17:52,801 --> 03:17:56,340
like all of the good guys,
all the good team Kinda came through and

4462
03:17:56,341 --> 03:17:57,174
they were flying over this world that 
was dark and fires and pollution and 

4463
03:18:00,210 --> 03:18:01,043
chaos.
And they were just bringing this like 

4464
03:18:03,061 --> 03:18:05,820
fresh air of like white light.
And I was just cruising.

4465
03:18:06,120 --> 03:18:08,160
And so for the last 30 minutes of the 
trip,

4466
03:18:08,460 --> 03:18:11,810
I was just literally like flapping my 
wings in division,

4467
03:18:11,940 --> 03:18:14,790
just Kinda cruising over the world with 
all my ego.

4468
03:18:14,790 --> 03:18:19,790
Homeys and,
and it was fucking one of the GNARLIEST,

4469
03:18:19,891 --> 03:18:24,420
obviously experiences I've ever had.
No doubt.

4470
03:18:24,480 --> 03:18:25,313
That's why it's illegal.
But your speech is going to be used in 

4471
03:18:27,911 --> 03:18:28,744
the Senate.
They're going to get together with 

4472
03:18:29,401 --> 03:18:31,740
Congress.
They got to play this speech back.

4473
03:18:31,770 --> 03:18:33,390
This is a successful guy,
folks.

4474
03:18:33,510 --> 03:18:34,590
Look what he's doing.
Yeah.

4475
03:18:34,700 --> 03:18:39,630
It goes down with the God damn jungle 
fighting world crushers and Jesus's Gay.

4476
03:18:39,660 --> 03:18:41,970
Do you want Jesus to be,
you want that?

4477
03:18:42,360 --> 03:18:43,470
Oh Geez,
give me a woman.

4478
03:18:43,950 --> 03:18:46,020
Jesus can be a man.
He can be a woman.

4479
03:18:46,021 --> 03:18:48,570
He's gender fluid.
Yup.

4480
03:18:48,610 --> 03:18:49,800
Wow.
And tense.

4481
03:18:50,290 --> 03:18:52,840
And again,
I think the lessons necessary,

4482
03:18:53,290 --> 03:18:54,123
it's really just about,
that was the type of resistance that 

4483
03:18:56,771 --> 03:18:59,050
could summon the very best out of me.
You know,

4484
03:18:59,051 --> 03:19:02,920
the move to move to show the world,
Krush her love the move to,

4485
03:19:03,220 --> 03:19:05,140
you know,
all of the moves that I had to make.

4486
03:19:05,200 --> 03:19:06,033
I was only able to learn about myself 
from the extreme pressure of that 

4487
03:19:09,251 --> 03:19:11,590
vision.
And that's one of the beautiful parts of

4488
03:19:11,620 --> 03:19:15,040
the IOWASCA vision.
It tends to give you just enough that if

4489
03:19:15,041 --> 03:19:18,040
you show up with your best and you and 
you choose,

4490
03:19:18,070 --> 03:19:20,050
you know,
choose love and you choose the,

4491
03:19:20,500 --> 03:19:22,570
the things that are going to bring out 
the best outcome,

4492
03:19:23,500 --> 03:19:24,610
you'll make it through,
but it,

4493
03:19:24,640 --> 03:19:27,550
but it brings you to that very fucking 
brink where it feels like,

4494
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:29,260
man,
you know,

4495
03:19:29,261 --> 03:19:30,910
the stakes are really,
really high.

4496
03:19:31,450 --> 03:19:33,250
It's interesting because I think stories
like that

4497
03:19:33,990 --> 03:19:34,823
and experiences like yours,
although you've got to go somewhere to 

4498
03:19:37,561 --> 03:19:38,394
experience them legally,
the those stories are what people are 

4499
03:19:42,001 --> 03:19:42,834
going to rely.
That's like almost like a road map of 

4500
03:19:45,511 --> 03:19:48,540
the potential experiences that people 
are gonna come back with and go to,

4501
03:19:48,541 --> 03:19:49,890
dude,
look what he's saying about this.

4502
03:19:49,891 --> 03:19:51,060
Do you want it?
Do you want to go there?

4503
03:19:51,210 --> 03:19:52,440
Do you want to go?
How do we get there?

4504
03:19:52,470 --> 03:19:53,303
You got to go over the mountain.
You go over the mountain to meet the 

4505
03:19:54,541 --> 03:19:55,920
world crusher.
Fuck man.

4506
03:19:56,550 --> 03:19:58,080
Okay.
He definitely came back.

4507
03:19:58,110 --> 03:19:58,801
Yeah,
he's back,

4508
03:19:58,801 --> 03:19:59,730
man.
He's in Austin.

4509
03:19:59,760 --> 03:20:00,630
He's hanging out.
Yeah.

4510
03:20:00,980 --> 03:20:01,813
Like one day,
all this stuff is going to be legal and 

4511
03:20:04,381 --> 03:20:07,290
one day all sorts of psychedelic 
experiences,

4512
03:20:07,291 --> 03:20:09,930
whether it's masculine or fucking 
mushrooms,

4513
03:20:09,931 --> 03:20:10,764
whatever,
they're all going to be really 

4514
03:20:12,250 --> 03:20:13,083
commonplace.
They're going to be as commonplace is 

4515
03:20:14,491 --> 03:20:16,530
going to get a massage or it's common 
places,

4516
03:20:17,100 --> 03:20:18,720
you know,
taking a yoga class.

4517
03:20:19,590 --> 03:20:20,423
Just right now we're in a weird place 
where someone like you tell him that 

4518
03:20:23,311 --> 03:20:25,410
story seems like a crazy person.
Yeah.

4519
03:20:25,470 --> 03:20:26,303
You know,
even talking to me who's experienced a 

4520
03:20:28,591 --> 03:20:29,850
bunch of shit,
you know,

4521
03:20:29,851 --> 03:20:31,590
and I've experienced a bunch of shit 
with you.

4522
03:20:31,591 --> 03:20:32,460
I mean,
I know you're not,

4523
03:20:33,050 --> 03:20:37,080
I mean you're not crazy.
You're just relaying this very odd thing

4524
03:20:37,081 --> 03:20:39,630
that very few people who are ever going 
to be able to relate to right now,

4525
03:20:39,990 --> 03:20:42,900
but one day,
one day it'll be real common and I think

4526
03:20:42,901 --> 03:20:44,330
it's more common now.
I think when you,

4527
03:20:44,331 --> 03:20:45,164
you saying this now way more common,
do you talk about Iowasca and people 

4528
03:20:48,931 --> 03:20:51,300
understand what you're saying then?
Just 10 15 years ago,

4529
03:20:51,660 --> 03:20:52,490
you know?

4530
03:20:52,490 --> 03:20:53,091
Oh,
no doubt.

4531
03:20:53,091 --> 03:20:55,760
Because people have had similar 
experiences of reference.

4532
03:20:55,761 --> 03:20:56,594
I mean,
I think the way that a lot of people 

4533
03:20:58,131 --> 03:20:58,964
experience this is in archetypes that 
you learn about and there's a different 

4534
03:21:01,761 --> 03:21:03,290
character in the story.
You know,

4535
03:21:03,320 --> 03:21:06,140
which something you can learn from like 
the Harry Potter movies,

4536
03:21:06,141 --> 03:21:06,590
like,
uh,

4537
03:21:06,590 --> 03:21:08,240
like Jordan was talking about,
you know,

4538
03:21:08,241 --> 03:21:11,930
you can learn from those archetypes,
but it's different when you know,

4539
03:21:11,990 --> 03:21:16,370
you get a chance to play as the main 
character playing is the main character.

4540
03:21:16,371 --> 03:21:19,010
It gives you a whole different series of
lessons.

4541
03:21:19,011 --> 03:21:21,770
Like none of these themes that came up,
you know,

4542
03:21:21,771 --> 03:21:24,350
our original themes,
these are all deep archetypes.

4543
03:21:24,351 --> 03:21:26,600
Even fucking the Lord of the ring,
like the stone,

4544
03:21:26,730 --> 03:21:29,210
it was a stone of such evil.
How does it be destroyed?

4545
03:21:29,211 --> 03:21:31,310
It destroyed in the fire from whence it 
came,

4546
03:21:31,490 --> 03:21:32,323
right?
All of creation created in concentrated 

4547
03:21:34,280 --> 03:21:36,650
and there was dissolved in that.
I didn't think about it then,

4548
03:21:36,651 --> 03:21:38,570
but I could see the analogies.
You see the,

4549
03:21:38,860 --> 03:21:40,400
um,
the deal with the devil.

4550
03:21:40,401 --> 03:21:41,180
You know,
that,

4551
03:21:41,180 --> 03:21:44,810
that I'll trade my soul for this one.
You see these archetypal,

4552
03:21:45,290 --> 03:21:46,100
but you

4553
03:21:46,100 --> 03:21:48,410
know,
I can watch as many faust places I want.

4554
03:21:48,680 --> 03:21:50,510
I'm never going to feel what that feels 
like,

4555
03:21:50,540 --> 03:21:51,373
right.
Until I have the devil mocking me for 

4556
03:21:52,671 --> 03:21:55,910
being a coward,
for not being willing to make that deal.

4557
03:21:56,240 --> 03:21:58,430
You know?
And then you understand these certain,

4558
03:21:58,880 --> 03:22:00,740
these certain things in a much,
much deeper way.

4559
03:22:00,741 --> 03:22:01,850
And,
and that's,

4560
03:22:01,940 --> 03:22:03,080
that's,
I think the value.

4561
03:22:03,081 --> 03:22:06,350
It just puts you up in this situation 
where you're,

4562
03:22:06,500 --> 03:22:09,110
you have stake in the game and you have 
choices to make,

4563
03:22:09,470 --> 03:22:10,303
and that's where you get the real value.
I think Roger Huerta would've put that 

4564
03:22:13,070 --> 03:22:13,903
world crushing in a Thai clinch and 
slash or right into is fucking stupid 

4565
03:22:16,431 --> 03:22:18,740
phase for sure.
And that's part of it.

4566
03:22:18,741 --> 03:22:19,880
You know,
some of the Shamans,

4567
03:22:19,881 --> 03:22:20,990
that's their move,
right?

4568
03:22:20,991 --> 03:22:25,010
They're constantly trying to get mastery
and dominion over all of these things.

4569
03:22:25,011 --> 03:22:25,844
Wow.
I just find that the more you try and 

4570
03:22:26,571 --> 03:22:28,670
fight with them,
the more they just love it.

4571
03:22:28,790 --> 03:22:31,190
Do you like whatever thing you're trying
to fight,

4572
03:22:31,191 --> 03:22:32,540
whatever darkness you're trying to 
fight,

4573
03:22:32,541 --> 03:22:34,190
the more you fight with them.
They're just like,

4574
03:22:34,191 --> 03:22:35,240
fuck yeah,
bring it on.

4575
03:22:35,241 --> 03:22:36,950
This is what I do.
You're in my house now,

4576
03:22:36,951 --> 03:22:37,880
bitch.
You know,

4577
03:22:37,881 --> 03:22:41,480
like you're trying to wrestle with Ben 
Asker and like they got the drop on you,

4578
03:22:41,481 --> 03:22:42,314
but the minute you change the game and 
recognize them as an important part and 

4579
03:22:45,171 --> 03:22:47,420
send them love,
that's when the conflict ends.

4580
03:22:47,810 --> 03:22:49,130
One day.
Ladies and gentlemen,

4581
03:22:49,370 --> 03:22:50,203
you too.
We'll be able to go to your local 

4582
03:22:51,981 --> 03:22:52,814
IOWASCA center and partake and it's 
already been approved by the Supreme 

4583
03:22:58,550 --> 03:23:00,950
Court for a couple of different churches
to different churches I believe.

4584
03:23:00,951 --> 03:23:01,760
Right?
Yeah.

4585
03:23:01,760 --> 03:23:04,330
And you mentioned center diamond and uh,
uh,

4586
03:23:04,490 --> 03:23:06,260
udv.
Yeah.

4587
03:23:06,350 --> 03:23:11,350
And they are legally allowed to serve 
super high potency IOWASCA.

4588
03:23:12,590 --> 03:23:13,423
Yup.
Over Rick Strassman went over there and 

4589
03:23:14,631 --> 03:23:15,200
did it with him.

4590
03:23:15,200 --> 03:23:18,080
He said it was incredible.
They're all wearing like golf shirts,

4591
03:23:18,100 --> 03:23:18,933
Hawaiian,
White,

4592
03:23:19,880 --> 03:23:20,860
sit up,
sit down,

4593
03:23:20,900 --> 03:23:22,220
talk to do different things.
Yeah.

4594
03:23:22,460 --> 03:23:23,420
It's all common,
you know,

4595
03:23:23,421 --> 03:23:26,120
whether it's religious or whether it's 
medical or whether it's,

4596
03:23:26,360 --> 03:23:30,290
I think the plants are going to show up 
when humans need the help the most.

4597
03:23:30,291 --> 03:23:32,330
And I think that's,
that's the spot we're in.

4598
03:23:32,331 --> 03:23:33,410
And you know,
I wasc,

4599
03:23:33,411 --> 03:23:36,350
it's not for everybody.
Like don't everybody rush out and do it.

4600
03:23:36,351 --> 03:23:38,390
Like do it.
If that's what's really calling for you.

4601
03:23:38,630 --> 03:23:40,880
If you want to learn more,
I just released that documentary.

4602
03:23:40,881 --> 03:23:43,910
It's free.

But there's so many ways and you don't 

4606
03:23:49,731 --> 03:23:51,770
need to do plants.
You can do with your fucking breath.

4607
03:23:51,800 --> 03:23:53,570
You can do it with Yoga.
You can do it with floating.

4608
03:23:53,571 --> 03:23:55,970
You can do it with legal weed.
You know,

4609
03:23:55,971 --> 03:23:57,860
there's so many ways to climb the 
mountain.

4610
03:23:58,120 --> 03:23:59,450
Um,
but finding those,

4611
03:23:59,750 --> 03:24:01,970
those ways to bring out the best part of
yourself.

4612
03:24:02,300 --> 03:24:03,133
Essential drink the jungle pigeons.
Don't be scared to drink to drink the 

4613
03:24:08,710 --> 03:24:10,340
jumbo.
Don't be scared to drink jungle.

4614
03:24:10,341 --> 03:24:11,630
Spicy.
All right,

4615
03:24:12,410 --> 03:24:13,910
let's end this right.
That's perfect.

4616
03:24:14,450 --> 03:24:16,400
Drink the jungle.com.
Yeah,

4617
03:24:16,640 --> 03:24:17,990
that's it.
Bye everybody.

4618
03:24:18,200 --> 03:24:19,340
Love you.
Love you.

4619
03:24:19,400 --> 03:24:21,680
Love all you guys.
