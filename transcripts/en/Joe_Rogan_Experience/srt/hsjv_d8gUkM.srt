1
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,190
The joe rogan experience.
Now this shit ain't working.

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,020
I don't have my headphones on
blasted. You ever look for your head,

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,250
your sunglasses, and you realize
they're on your fucking face? Yeah. Yes.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,120
My sunglasses. And they're right there
in your fucking head. Yeah, that's,

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,430
that's when you know you should quit
weed, right? Is that the moment?

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,410
And he didn't take it.
Take some time off.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,920
Shit. I've been doing that
since I was a kid, man.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,100
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by several things,

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,310
several things. And we believe
in number one is the fleshlight.

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,550
I believe it. You know
why? Because I've used it.

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,850
I believe in it because you're Gunna
masturbates stop fucking playing games.

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,960
Listen,
you know you're going to masturbate.

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,320
You'll know you're going to masturbate.
Just get that over with.

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,970
You don't want to be counting on one
person to take care of your biological

15
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:00,820
needs. Okay? Because then you
become a slave to that one person.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,170
That's very dangerous.

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,330
You have to be able to take care of it
yourself because life would be chaos if

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,370
we couldn't reach our decks.

19
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:09,430
If our Dick Scher and some weird spot
in our back and we had to get a chick to

20
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:12,730
touch it. There was no way he could
do it yourself. You'd be doomed, man.

21
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:13,171
Just so you,

22
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:16,570
you would have the balance of power
would shift terribly against you.

23
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,230
It's the perfect cotton.
That sense in that sense,

24
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,560
the fleshlight is an empowerment tool.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,040
It allows you to extract biological
matter and remove some confusion in your

26
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:35,260
consciousness and some distractions in
your everyday life because all you're

27
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,890
thinking about is I got a park,
some of this fucking sperm somewhere.

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,730
You know it's building up inside your
balls like a bunch of wild steroid eat and

29
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:48,730
troops ready to fucking fly out and go
to war. That's what they're like, man,

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,410
that's what your loads are like. They're
like a little savages amped up refugees.

31
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,060
It's committing suicide,
jumping off trees face first to the rocks

32
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,030
and a thick load today, like really thick,
like uncomfortable. That's not good.

33
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,510
Yeah. What's that mean is that
you've got a clock, you got a clog,

34
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:14,540
a little thing down there. You got to
stick with Qtip in there and clean it out.

35
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,290
It was like a goober. Goober. Anyway,

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,980
click on the link it Joe rogan.net and
enter in the code name Rogan and you will

37
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:29,930
get 15% often number one sex toy for men
and then you could shoot your loads in

38
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:32,030
it.
That's right at a discount.

39
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:35,790
I've said this before and they
need to Mrs. Clause one bad. Yeah.

40
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,540
They should have totally come up with
a woman like snow on it and shit. Yeah,

41
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,020
little little white white hair.

42
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,340
Oh,
why not?

43
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,110
I think she was a virgin and
that's my mom's name. Right?

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,100
You shouldn't be the one person
to fuck marry, kill badge.

45
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,780
If they could go back in time and
eventually they'll get to that point.

46
00:02:56,781 --> 00:03:00,010
If you find like someone's like,
you know right now found like two ton

47
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,810
Commons body and then they put like,

48
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,050
we should talk about this
one not doing a commercial.

49
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,700
That's why the commercials are so
good. Dude. They're totally organic.

50
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,990
Let's just get him out of the way.

51
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,300
We are also brought to you by on it.com
makers of Alpha Breen and new mood,

52
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,120
which I'd take both of them on a
regular basis and the fucking awesome.

53
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,260
I support this not just because I'm
making money from it and because I,

54
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:27,550
if I wasn't making money from it, I would
still tell you to look into nootropics.

55
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,120
It's there. It's a fascinating
field of science really.

56
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:34,180
And it's all about
chemicals and, and, and um,

57
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,910
vitamins that enhance cognitive function.

58
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,440
And I think they work
differently on different people.
But for me, I get a nice,

59
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,520
like good,

60
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:47,140
clear feeling out of taking these things
and I don't believe it's a placebo. Um,

61
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,160
you know, there's, there's,

62
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,280
there's evidence that it helps Alzheimer's
patients when you give them like

63
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:55,690
certain nootropics that I can actually
can slow the onset of Alzheimer's.

64
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,260
Most importantly though,
if you don't like this stuff,

65
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:02,290
you get a hundred percent money
back guarantee. Just say it sucked.

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,320
If you don't have to return it, she'd say
it sucked and you get your money back.

67
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:09,940
It's really that simple. And if you like
it but you think it's too expensive. My,

68
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,360
what I say to you is please
go buy the shit in bulk.

69
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,610
Go and save yourself some money,

70
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,950
steal the ingredient list off the website
and just duplicate it. I really do.

71
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,770
I hope you do that and I hope you enjoy
it and I hope you look into the just the

72
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:25,360
subject of nootropics.

73
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,770
I'm neither educated enough nor do I
have enough time to go into depth enough

74
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,590
and have it actually be
interesting in a podcast. You know,

75
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:37,300
I would maybe like to have some like
scientist on explain brain chemistry to,

76
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,760
you know I,
but I couldn't do it obviously.

77
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:44,260
So the best I can say is go Google it and
look up nootropics and there's a bunch

78
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:47,970
of different kinds and there's a bunch
of different formulations that other

79
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,100
people offer as well. And a lot of them
are really good. I've tried power drive,

80
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:52,150
I think that stuff's really good.

81
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,960
There's a bunch of different companies
out there that sell similar stuff and not

82
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,050
saying buy my stuff, but if you
want to buy my stuff you can buy it.

83
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,570
And go to [inaudible] dot com
if you've got to Joe rogan.net,

84
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:04,840
click on the link for Alpha brain and
during the code name rogue and you get 10%

85
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:09,310
off that. Okay. Or not
whatever, Bro. Okay, Jesus.

86
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,750
Merry Christmas. Take me hit that shit.
Bitch. Duncan trussell's in the house.

87
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:14,584
Ladies and gentlemen,

88
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,170
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

89
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:24,990
I think

90
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,090
that was one of the best
commercials. Whoever did. Duncan

91
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,340
flowed seamlessly how it has to be,
man.

92
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:35,910
I can't just always say the
exact same thing. Fucks.

93
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,360
It's too uncomfortable.
I feel like a big phony.

94
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,250
I was talking to Stan
hope about that once, man.

95
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:44,730
He said the worst thing is when like he
like he goes to the UK and went to the

96
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:48,990
UK and he saw the same people were in
the same seat both nights that are like

97
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:51,960
really loud and they sat in the same seat
and then the second night they sat in

98
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:55,440
the same seat, but he's going to do like
most of the same material, you know?

99
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,770
I mean you only have so
much fucking material. And

100
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,460
the art of stand up comedy is to relay
each piece of material as if it's really

101
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,780
happening in your head right now.

102
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,700
But when someone just saw you the night
before say the exact same shit, you know,

103
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:13,790
and he's like, oh, it makes you feel
like such a fucking phony. Hate it.

104
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,320
When someone knows your shit.
It's flattering. It's flattering.

105
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:19,570
They're just trying to flatter you.

106
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,370
They're trying to make you feel like
we're super fans are coming to see you two

107
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:26,510
nights in a row. I do like, I mean, if
they are super fans though, I would like,

108
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,690
you know, if Bill Hicks was in town in
Boston, I saw him two nights in a row,

109
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,060
I saw the same set twice in a row.
I wanted to,

110
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,300
I like watching that because you get to
see the nuances and the way they do it

111
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:38,240
differently. It's cool. But for a lot
of people they don't want to see that,

112
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,010
you know? But I was, uh, you know,
you're an open like comic, you know,

113
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:45,650
an amateur and you know,
a total comedy nerd.

114
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,930
And know the opportunity
to see like a craftsman.

115
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,090
I saw Richard Jenny a couple
of nights in a row too.

116
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,570
I saw a couple of different guys a few
nights in a row. Like I went to see them.

117
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:57,000
I saw don my rare a couple of nights
in a row. You I wanted to see their,

118
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,280
their act over and over again.

119
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,560
I wanted to see how they did
it and it's interesting man,

120
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:03,950
when you see people's different reactions
in different crowds are like, wow,

121
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,580
why didn't that one work? Man,
this is crazy. Like this is weird.

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,990
Told you one of my favorite moments
in comedy is watching Bill Hicks bomb.

123
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,720
He bombed with the confidence and
flare of a man who was crushing.

124
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,090
Like it never bothered him.

125
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,210
Like there's a lot of people
who say it never bothered them,

126
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,360
but you can see this like fear or
detachment in their eyes is panic.

127
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:31,400
Look, he never got it. He
never got to the panic look.

128
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,050
He would bomb and as he was bombing he
would talk through the bombing and he was

129
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:39,320
doing this bit where he went on
after this other guy. And this,

130
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,330
the other guy that went
up is a very nice guy,

131
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:45,500
but he's really hacky and he had like
a bunch of like, you know, cartoons,

132
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:49,730
smoking pot jokes, where do
I get daffy duck smoking. Oh,

133
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,740
you know, another guy who was one of those
guys, but he was a nice guy. You know.

134
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,120
My point is he was killing
this audience was monkeys,

135
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,470
they were apes.

136
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,500
It was one of those dumb audiences and
every now and then to get them, you know,

137
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:07,400
in Boston you have some really educated
people and then you have a lot of troll

138
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:12,160
people to fucking cool. Yeah,
yeah. You've got a lot of those.

139
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,630
Well they did not like Hicks.
It all,

140
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:18,380
he came on like super
confident and like real,

141
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:22,030
like slow and deliberate with his,
uh,

142
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,690
the way he was putting his set out there,
you know, and like real, like you just,

143
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,760
you know, like you own the room, you know,

144
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:32,180
and just would start doing as
material and they didn't like it, man.

145
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,450
And they were leaving in droves and
he had this bit where Satan fucks John

146
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,240
Davidson in the ass and he would like
rotate people. It'd be John Davidson,

147
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:46,100
it would be Oprah.
And then he shits out Geraldo Rivera,

148
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,010
he's on the, on the toilet shitting, and
he's making this shit noise for like,

149
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,070
man, like two minutes, which is
a long time to just sit there

150
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,060
and he's making this and he looks up and
people are just leaving in giant groups.

151
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,120
It's fucking great. It's fucking terrible.
Fucking terrible. Not Funny at all.

152
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:07,050
After that last guy,

153
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,520
and then they're leaving and Hicks looks
up and I swear to God he wasn't even

154
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:13,170
phase. He goes, yeah,

155
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,290
it's generally clears the room
and just to me and my friends,

156
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,090
I think Fitzsimmons might've
been there for that one, um,

157
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,030
to being my friends and 50 people.
It was fucking hilarious.

158
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,070
The bits were hilarious. It was a, it was
like so interesting. It was, it wasn't,

159
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,210
I'll be honest, it was not the funniest
material than I'd ever seen in my life.

160
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,900
It wasn't the funniest delivery,
but it was certainly the most thoughtful,

161
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:43,350
without a doubt. It was a
totally different kind of
laughter I was experiencing.

162
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,980
I was experiencing experiencing
a laughter and the Lego fuck,

163
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:51,180
he just nailed it too. It wasn't
just the laughter, it was like, wow,

164
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,100
that's an awesome point to just shove into
a joke, you know? You know what I mean?

165
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,220
So it wasn't like he was the
funniest guy. Like he, you know,

166
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:01,460
if you compare it to him to like
the guys that I knew growing up,

167
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:05,490
like Steve Sweeney,
Steve Sweeney used to fucking Corolla.

168
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,840
I mean crushed the point where you
would be terrified to go on after him to

169
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:13,950
follow a guy like Steve Sweeney
in Boston when he's on full tilt,

170
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,600
when he goes up there just rabid and full
of energy, you're fucking doomed, man.

171
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,960
He's just too good.
And it was a hex wasn't like that.

172
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:25,110
It was a totally different kind
of funny, you know, it was,

173
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:26,700
it was it's own little thing,
man.

174
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:30,600
And it influenced a lot of people
to sort of branch often in,

175
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:33,600
into a more thoughtful
direction, you know? Yeah,

176
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:38,601
it's really cool when you see somebody
who's got the balls to just say exactly

177
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:42,750
what they're thinking on stage with
zero pandering. Yeah, that's not,

178
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:46,920
that's not going to be that. That
can't be that kind of crushing comedy.

179
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:50,180
It's a different thing all together.
It's still super funny. But you know,

180
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,100
my thing is, dude, I
like the sandwich at it.

181
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,960
I like to shove it in between shit
that just has no points at all.

182
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:01,890
Just ridiculous. And just the stuff
that I think is funny and it's usually,

183
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,460
she's like gay jokes.
It's usually for whatever reason,

184
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,530
it's usually someone inadvertently sucking
your dick or be someone is sucking a

185
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:14,430
dick for a reward.
My sense of humor is so fucking juvenile,

186
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:18,330
man. I'm so childish. And I actually
thought like, man, maybe I got a problem.

187
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:22,470
Like why am I such a child with like
stuff that I think is silly and funny?

188
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,330
You know? Like maybe there's
something wrong with that.

189
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,670
And then I went to see Jim Norton and uh,

190
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,330
Jim Norton was in Austin and
he had more Dick Jokes than me.

191
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,250
And I said to him afterwards, I go, dude,

192
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,620
I was starting to think maybe I have too
many jokes about Dixon my ass until him

193
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,171
what to see you.

194
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:40,620
I saw an hour's worth of Dick Jokes
and I fucking thoroughly enjoyed it.

195
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,390
I'm like, thank you.
That made me feel good.

196
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:45,210
Cause as a a person who
was an audience member,

197
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:47,610
I saw it from an audience
member's perspective like, oh,

198
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:51,030
it's just a big crazy silly ride.
And you go like, it's not like,

199
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,930
you know you can't have so many
jokes about dicks. And also

200
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,240
if you think it's funny, then you kind
of have a, an obligation to do it.

201
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:01,720
As a comic. Can you think something's
funny? You should talk about it on stage,

202
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,780
but because if you think
something's funny or like, oh no,

203
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,860
that's not high brow enough,
I'm not going to do that.

204
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,490
And that's another form of pandering.
That's not it at all.

205
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:13,390
It's exactly, if you have a
joke about shitting your pants,

206
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:16,000
you're supposed to tell that joke.
Yeah. It's not supposed to be out to,

207
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,660
oh you're doing straddle logical material.
If you think it's funny.

208
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,553
That's the thing.

209
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,150
If you're just doing it to get it shock
out of people and you're doing at a lazy,

210
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,330
that's a whole different story.

211
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,570
Ari Shapiro has been doing some
bit that's been killing about,

212
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,910
he was in Australia and he got diarrhea.

213
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:34,460
It's a totally true story and it's
fucking killing for him. You know?

214
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,120
For someone to say that you're not
supposed to do that. It's funny.

215
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,140
It's really funny and it happened.
It's a real story, you know,

216
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:43,320
to for you to say that there's
something wrong with this.

217
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,890
For you to say that
there's any kind of rule.

218
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,240
It's like telling an artist where you
know you can't paint. That's light green.

219
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,400
Yeah.
If you come over someone's house,

220
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:54,250
like you have to really know that person
before you talk about shitting herself.

221
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,080
Yeah. It's a weird thing. Unless
they're a dog. When you're on stage,

222
00:12:59,081 --> 00:12:59,980
it's one thing,
right?

223
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:03,610
You're supposed to be exposing everything
to anybody anyway, but if you were,

224
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,031
you know,

225
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:06,770
you don't know someone and they start
talking to you about shitting all of

226
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:10,540
themselves. You come over here, I need to
talk to you about it. I'm cool with it.

227
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,230
You know,
if like you're a good dude,

228
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:16,400
like you seem like just an
open dude and you're like,

229
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,830
how's the cheeseburgers
there? I was like, well,

230
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,120
they're pretty good but lives in the last
time I had, I'm to be honest with you,

231
00:13:20,121 --> 00:13:22,270
I shut all over myself.
I couldn't even make it to the bathroom.

232
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,090
I would start laughing like, oh shit.
And you think that's what it is.

233
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,240
I would have a normal conversation with
you. I wouldn't be like, excuse me,

234
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,760
to Judith Segall,
shit on yourself.

235
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,370
How dare you sir.
Speak to me like such a scoundrel.

236
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,700
Who all you,
how dare you?

237
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,480
Where do you get this confidence
to come to me? Isn't that funny?

238
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:46,180
When you realize that you're
actually offending someone,

239
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:49,590
you realize that like this
really is in some way.

240
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:53,950
Something I'm saying is having an effect
on you that's like causing you to shut

241
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:55,480
down.
Listen folks,

242
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:58,270
I know you've been programmed to think
that you're the asshole when you're

243
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:03,100
swearing and someone reacts like that, but
no, no, they're the asshole. That's dumb.

244
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,700
It's 2000 and fucking 11
if you're really offended.

245
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,910
If someone talks to you about shitting
their pants, then you're the dummy.

246
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,310
You're the problem.
It's not the guy who shit his pants.

247
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,230
That guy's telling you a funny story.
Okay?

248
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,960
You're just some weird stuck up person.
It doesn't want to hear that.

249
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,520
Like if I don't think something's
funny and it's got a logical,

250
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,600
I'm not going to get offended.
I'm just going to, it's not funny.

251
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,451
It's not going to bother me.

252
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:28,810
It's like whatever you're talking about
shitting herself, fine. I don't really,

253
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:30,910
it's not, it's, it doesn't
bother me. It, some people,

254
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,840
they've never heard that
stuff before. Comedians, we,

255
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,590
we've been horrifying each other for eons.

256
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,390
You've horrified me in so
many different ways. You

257
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,010
feel you're really, really good at, um,

258
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,150
taking a story that already kind
of know, for example, grizzly man,

259
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,920
the guy getting eaten by the bear.

260
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,240
So like you'll give me really high and
then start talking about like, yeah,

261
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:05,120
like what, what was the Gwas grizzly
man, his name was Timothy Treadwell.

262
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,050
Timothy Treadwell.

263
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:11,051
And you start describing him getting
eaten by a bear in this like precise,

264
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,190
microscopic way where you're like every
moment you're describing the bones

265
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:20,900
crunching and his femur snapping and like
you're just really good at taking it.

266
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:24,780
Like to the next level to yeah,
wait to become a werewolf.

267
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,610
Cause at first you start talking about it,
you know when you're high, you're high,

268
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:30,410
you're like, well fuck, you're
seeing it's so clear. I'm like,

269
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:32,280
I'm not going to let I know
what he's doing. He's a,

270
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:35,600
he's going to take this into
the deep water in a second.

271
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,280
I'm not going to let it freak me out.

272
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,320
And I still remember the Treadwell story
and sure enough, I'm like, Jesus God,

273
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:44,900
this is horrible.
Poured Timothy Treadwell.

274
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,040
I could just see his bones turning into
jelly and his eyeballs bulging out.

275
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:54,890
Is he screaming for the bear to stop
attacking him? But it won't. Anyway,

276
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,060
you're very good at that.

277
00:15:56,061 --> 00:16:01,061
So after you've been hanging out with
people who can professionally tell stories

278
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,770
in the most detailed way,

279
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,430
then it's really hard to get around
anyone who's going to say anything that

280
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:11,840
offends you. And also the Internet by
the way, is also like what's going to,

281
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,370
I've seen every,
I've seen everything.

282
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,300
My favorite picture in the Internet.
This is a strong same statement. Yeah,

283
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:18,010
and it's true.

284
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,660
My favorite picture is there as a kid
and he's standing in front of the goats,

285
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:26,560
see butthole and the guy's spreading his
ass hole open and it just says welcome

286
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:31,060
to the Internet. Yeah. The kid
is looking at that and I'm like,

287
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,290
yeah, that's it. Exactly.
Yeah. You can't get, you can't
get upset by things anymore.

288
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,130
It's kind of retro and
quaint when you are,

289
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,730
when you come upon someone who actually
can get offended, when you realize,

290
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,180
oh my God, you can still get offended.
How have you maintained that?

291
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,220
That's amazing.
This I,

292
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:51,240
you mean I really have the power
to disturb you in a real way. Yeah.

293
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,670
Like you don't realize though, you're
not under the glove all day at work.

294
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,700
A lot of people are under the
iron glove all day at work.

295
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,070
They're just stuck in an
office where they're there.

296
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,360
All their behavior was restricted.
Most of them even have to dress funny.

297
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,630
They have to wear like weird things around
their neck to signify that they mean

298
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:09,070
business. Yeah. Right. And you're,

299
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,160
you're walking around in some office
where everybody's stifled and you're all

300
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:16,540
forced together today all day to do
shit you don't want to do all day long.

301
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,370
You know, it's, it's, that's not good.

302
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,070
So people are like buttoned
down because of that.

303
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:25,070
Whereas you can do your smoking pot and
playing world of Warcraft, you know,

304
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:27,170
trying to write some jokes, you know, and,

305
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,500
and then we're going to go on
the road and we'll go to Chicago.

306
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:32,800
We'll do the Chicago Theater
January 27th with Joey Diaz. Yeah.

307
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,680
But you know what I'm saying? Like that's
your, your world, right? You're not,

308
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:39,450
you don't have like a shit job that you,
you know, get up to every morning. Right.

309
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,680
That's true. That that's, yeah. So yeah,

310
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:44,680
I understand people are buttoned down
and they've got conditioned and some,

311
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,880
it's too hard to just go away plus free
you all the time and you're at work all

312
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,040
and you're just like,
why

313
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,820
can't, why can we fucking talk?
Yeah. This is crazy. This job sucks.

314
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:55,860
This is ridiculous. We've got to
find another way to make money.

315
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,610
Or like those fucking email forwards
it. Those people saying, do you know,

316
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,330
hit those email forwards and it's
like the worst joke of all time.

317
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,100
What are the chicken side of the rabbit?
And he shut the fuck up.

318
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,580
You know? My mom was brutal. My mom was
brutal with those. I had to stop her.

319
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,520
I said I was really nice about
it. I was like, does this,

320
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:16,860
there was this not that funny to me.
And by the way,

321
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:19,200
I don't want your friends sending
me any crazy emails, so don't,

322
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:23,160
let's not link it all together.
Doesn't even know how blind carbon copy.

323
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:26,370
She just copies it copies here. She
hasn't sent me one in a long time though.

324
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,450
But the ones she did, I would still just
look back and I'm like, oh Jesus Christ.

325
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,490
But what about those also when you
get on those patriotic mailers, oh,

326
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,290
those are brutal.
I've had a bunch of those country.

327
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,650
I once knew that this is a
story about a country. Yeah.

328
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:44,110
And then just make things up. Yeah.
The, the thousands of terrorist acts.

329
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:48,450
So we prevented, how about
total was, could have wiped
out humanity 17 times over.

330
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,750
But we're out there doing the dirty
work. They were stopped. Yeah.

331
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,930
There's a jog living in Georgia.

332
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:57,690
It always tries to find
like so cinnamon oh party.

333
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,970
There's a dog living in
whose master didn't come. Oh,

334
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:04,590
stories are great. Well, you know what,

335
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:06,750
it would be beautiful if
that really was the case.

336
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,470
Could you imagine if you really had 100%
faith in the u s military and you knew

337
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:14,430
that there was a bad guys and we're the
good guy and it's clean, black and white.

338
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,240
There's no doubt about it. We
only do the right thing. Always.

339
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:21,660
We avoid war whenever possible and we
would never engage in warfare profit like,

340
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,070
but that's what people
like to think that like,

341
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,710
they like to think that
that's what we are.

342
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,430
Well, it would like if,
if every 50 years, uh,

343
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,110
Scorpions climbed out of the volcanoes
of the earth and they were like poisonous

344
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:38,410
and deadly and they shot lasers out of
their eyes and they could like burn you

345
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,720
alive and you met someone who's like,

346
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,570
I've made the decision to go
down and fight the scorpions.

347
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,080
I'm going to fight him, I'm going to
give my life to fight these scorpions.

348
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,610
You would be like, you are
fucking hero hero. That's a real,

349
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:55,960
here are amazing. You're going to go
fight the laser shooting scorpions.

350
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,760
It's incredible. Now it's so
muddied. It's like wow. You know,

351
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,290
they don't even know a lot of them. They
don't even know what they're doing now.

352
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,920
Like, well, we're going to
Afghanistan because um, oh,

353
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:06,754
you know,

354
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,060
we're going down there cause uh, you know,
Obama's not going to veto this fucking,

355
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,930
this new bill,

356
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,800
the one that passed through the house
pass through the Senate and the Congress,

357
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,630
apparently they, they, oh, okay.

358
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,300
Didn't know Obama was not going to be
totally turns the United States into a

359
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:26,420
battle. Indefinite detention. Yeah.

360
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,670
Indefinite detention for United States
civilians. Yeah. It doesn't have to,

361
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,880
you don't have to. Yeah. You don't have
to go to trial. Did you see the thing,

362
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,200
I was on Reddit with Mccain,
I ran Paul as Mccain point blank.

363
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:43,201
Does this mean that you can arrest a
United States citizen and detain them?

364
00:20:43,631 --> 00:20:46,960
And definitely, I just tweeted it,
but, and Mccain is like, you know,

365
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,620
pretty straight forward.

366
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:53,621
It's like if someone is a threat to
the security of the United States,

367
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,550
we should be able to arrest them and
detain them because apparently like a lot

368
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:01,180
of the people that they didn't detain
indefinitely and they let out according to

369
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:03,520
Mccain ended up killing some troops.

370
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,680
Yeah. So I like what they're saying.
What they're saying is, listen,

371
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:10,430
this is some fucking dirty warfare
and we need some extra power,

372
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,990
but we're not going to abuse it.

373
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,190
But the problem is you can't get that
extra power because everybody abuses power

374
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,350
once they get it.
There was just the,

375
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,100
otherwise they would already
be an accounting for all
the fucking money that's

376
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:25,880
missing. That would already be
there would already be someone,

377
00:21:25,881 --> 00:21:30,230
some repercussions for all the lies that
were told that led us to believe there

378
00:21:30,231 --> 00:21:32,420
was weapons of mass destruction.
Just straight up lies.

379
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,500
We think about what you can get in
trouble for. You know what, what you,

380
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,290
what you know what you were thinking
about like how crazy insider trading is.

381
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,510
You can get arrested if you
have information that will,

382
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:43,730
you know a stock's going to go bad.
Think about that.

383
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,780
But then think about the fact that someone
somewhere lied about weapons of mass

384
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:52,310
destructions. They, they made up some
sort of a story or they fabricated some,

385
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:57,311
some evidence and it became the real
reason why people supported the idea going

386
00:21:57,621 --> 00:22:02,360
there and yet it didn't exist. So if we
know that and that's not chased down.

387
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,020
Yeah, you don't chase that
down. There's, there's no,

388
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,660
there's no like big news followup
and documentaries about it.

389
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,610
How they chase that down and
found out how it happened.

390
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:13,940
Locked everybody up and cleaned out all
the people that they were in business

391
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:16,130
with. No, it's just somehow or another,

392
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:20,990
it kind of gets swept under the
rug that a war was started on.

393
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:21,870
Bullshit.
Yeah.

394
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,150
They've allowed somehow another hypnotize
people to the point where people have

395
00:22:26,151 --> 00:22:29,690
allowed a war to be created on bullshit.

396
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,680
A country that had
absolutely no connection.

397
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,810
Then we could see like a
straight connection to Iraq.
What the fuck is that? Yeah,

398
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,040
it makes no sense. Oh, we gotta
go over there and get him.

399
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,230
He's got weapons of mass
destruction. Okay. Listen,

400
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,390
we were going to go to war
with the people that killed us,

401
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:46,490
but we can't figure out who the fuck
they are. Cause apparently don't matter.

402
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,330
They're nomadic terrorists that have
actually been living in America training.

403
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:54,050
Let a flow. Okay. Okay. Since we get the,
they're all dead. Since we can't get them,

404
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,710
let's go get some people
that look like them. Right.

405
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,250
Let's go get some people in another
country. Not even from a small country.

406
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:06,020
It's like, it's like Canada does something
fucked up and people go attack Mexico.

407
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,220
It's that fucked up. It's that silly.
Oh, then that's what it's like.

408
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:14,000
It's like if Canada attack somebody and
then they decided to attack Mexico and

409
00:23:14,001 --> 00:23:15,720
retaliation. No, that's

410
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,680
what I want.

411
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,680
I walk my dog and I walk my dog past
this House with these two ferocious dogs

412
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:24,670
behind a fence. I've got little
Chihuahua. And so that you,

413
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:26,790
Allah loves coming in,

414
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:30,840
standing in front of this
fence and barking because
what happens is the two dogs

415
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:35,370
come charging down towards my
Chihuahua and barking at my dog.

416
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,610
And one of them is so mad at my Chihuahua
that it starts biting the other one on

417
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:43,440
it's ass. And it's the funniest
thing you've ever seen.

418
00:23:43,441 --> 00:23:47,750
It's just taking it out on the closest
thing that it can bite, you know, so,

419
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,010
so it's like also,
isn't this known as, um,

420
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,630
isn't it kind of like what
happened in Afghanistan?

421
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:57,680
Isn't that called Bull Baiting? Isn't that
what it is? It's like a sun sometimes.

422
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:02,090
This is what really creeps me
out is I think that, uh, the, um,

423
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,510
the people that were fighting
in Afghanistan and the
war that we picked with

424
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:09,260
people, uh, I think they're really
good at fucking war. You know,

425
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:11,660
Afghanistan is called
the graveyard of empires.

426
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:16,430
And I think that the people that were up
against aren't just as stupid as a lot

427
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:18,860
of people would like to paint
them. You know, they can't fucking,

428
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,930
they can't even read. They're just hungry,
starving. People who can't even read,

429
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,010
they don't know what they're doing.

430
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,250
I think they kind of do know what
they're doing. I think that they, I mean,

431
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,380
a bin Ladin said,

432
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,950
all we have to do is like make it seem
like we're going to attack and look at

433
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:37,400
how much money the United States spends.
They were just like, oh, we have to work.

434
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,190
They turned on a fucking money faucet.
They basically like,

435
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,390
well look at what they did.
Look at if look at what al Qaeda did.

436
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,970
We now have a,

437
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,040
a country where our military can arrest
us if we're considered a threat to the

438
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:54,120
security of the United
States. So that, you know,

439
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,060
cause I mean a journalism mean anything
journalists could that mean like a Wiki

440
00:24:58,061 --> 00:25:00,680
leaks guy?
Couldn't Malcolm X if we can.

441
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:03,320
Malcolm X had gotten arrested
and detained indefinitely.

442
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,350
Just don't you think that he would
get arrested that lower? Sure.

443
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:10,820
If he was in America fucking ever than
being assassinated though he hasn't been

444
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:12,440
assassinated yet.
But if,

445
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,700
if they could arrest him or assassinated
what they've done with that guy,

446
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:16,941
you know,

447
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:20,060
he's in a sort of a similar situation
where he has to report to a police station

448
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:23,150
like every year is to check in and
he's not allowed to go anywhere.

449
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:27,020
And as his trial is like still, he hasn't
been, they want to send them off to,

450
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:31,620
where was it? Norway, Norwegian who
was charged with now Sweden, Sweden,

451
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,260
sexual misconduct.

452
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,560
Whatever he did is just some weird moment
where is in bed with a girl apparently

453
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:40,010
she's saying, yeah, stuck his dick
in her without a condom and yeah.

454
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,300
Well it seems like we are,

455
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:45,110
sometimes it feels like we're on the
precipice where they're going to stop even

456
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:49,880
putting up this act that they're debating
and deciding and using courtrooms. The,

457
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,060
see that's the problem with indefinite
detention because it's like,

458
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,570
let's imagine that I think [inaudible]
I don't know. Let's imagine,

459
00:25:56,571 --> 00:26:00,740
I think the Alex Jones is a threat to
the security of the United States because

460
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:04,280
of the things that he's been saying
or weakening the government. Right?

461
00:26:04,281 --> 00:26:05,990
So let's imagine that the government,

462
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:10,070
the federal government decides to Alex
Jones is a real threat. And so they, uh,

463
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,310
they decided to arrest them.
They've got to put them on trial.

464
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,140
They've got to prove
that he's a real threat.

465
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,810
Was he like manufacturing
fucking explosives?

466
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,450
Was he planning on doing
something to a federal building?

467
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,800
There will be a trial and in the trial
they could use evidence to show if he was

468
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:28,130
really a real threat, play his
tapes, show what he was up to.

469
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,460
Now the military can just arrest him.

470
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,640
It's not even arrest cause they're,
they're not putting them on trial.

471
00:26:34,641 --> 00:26:37,850
They get to tell anybody
they were arrested and they
just come and get you and

472
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:42,350
they put you away indefinitely because
somebody thought you were a threat to

473
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,450
this curity of United
States that chills me, dude,

474
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:47,460
that is so fucked up.

475
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:52,260
And if you think that's just going to be
used for, I don't know, whoever it is,

476
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:55,770
these invisible people that I'm not even
sure who they are that are lurking in

477
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:58,620
New York or wherever they're at.
You're crazy.

478
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,360
If you think that's going to
happen, fucking turn on. Uh, um, uh,

479
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:04,830
some Waco footage,
you know,

480
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,820
watch those fucking ATF agents
torching that Koresh compound.

481
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,050
If you think that they're just going to
fucking use this law for the worst and

482
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:17,250
most extreme cases, no fucking
way, man, they are going to use it.

483
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:20,130
They're going to use it any way that
they want to use it for drug dealers.

484
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,600
They're going to use it, use it for
whatever they want to use it for.

485
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,590
They're going to use it for
anybody, man. I mean we're,

486
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:27,200
we could be doing this fucking podcast.
It's not a female.

487
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Can't think of what you saw that cop at
Uc Davis due to those kids that were on

488
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:37,180
their knees because he thought he could,
cause the law was on his side.

489
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,140
They weren't moving. He told
them to comply. They did not.

490
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,200
So he thought it was okay to spray
chemicals in children's faces. Yup.

491
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,700
And that guy is representative
of human nature.

492
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:52,970
He's representative of abusive
power. It's very simple. It's,

493
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,480
it's no logic. Abuse of power. Yeah.

494
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:58,330
I get someone has made your
life a little more difficult.

495
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,970
They made your job a little harder
because now you have to look out for,

496
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,290
you know, all these kids and
they're all this place where they,

497
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,710
you don't want him to be,
but guess what? Fuck face.

498
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,170
You're not allowed to spray him in
the face with fucking chemicals.

499
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,860
That's assault.

500
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,620
You're assaulting kids and you're think
you're allowed to do that because of

501
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:15,220
something written on a piece of
paper. Fuck you. Stupid. That's dumb.

502
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,600
You think that that's,
that's morally reprehensible.

503
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,660
Just innately it's in your mind.
You know,

504
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,950
that's a negative thing in your mind.

505
00:28:24,951 --> 00:28:27,610
Do you know that a peaceful
protest with students,

506
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:31,180
with children who have this idealistic
view of the world and you're going to

507
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:35,260
squash it while you're
wearing a bulletproof vest
and spray them in the face

508
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:38,470
with fucking chemicals.
They want a peaceful protest,

509
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:42,160
which is supposedly guaranteed us.

510
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,110
We're supposed to have
the right to assemble.

511
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,310
We're supposed to be able to get together,
even if it is private property,

512
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,220
you know, would that is where
the issue takes place. Well,

513
00:28:51,221 --> 00:28:52,870
where the fuck out should they be?

514
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,460
Well, no. Yeah, you,

515
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,540
you're supposed to be able to do that and
you're supposed to be able to do a lot

516
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:57,800
of them

517
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,430
and the community should embrace it
and the fucking school should have a

518
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:04,700
dialogue with them. They're supposed
to be ironing everything out.

519
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,680
You're not supposed to just,
you know,

520
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,000
new spray people in the face with fucking
chemicals. But because that guy could,

521
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,420
because he wasn't just some guy who
didn't like what the kids were saying,

522
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,770
you know,
like if you and I went down there,

523
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:18,070
you don't like these fucking kids
are spoiled. I'm going to fuck it.

524
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:21,710
Spray him in the face with tear gas,
Yo Dude, they would lock me in jail.

525
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,790
They would tackle me,

526
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:25,820
throw me to the ground because I don't
have the authority to assault them.

527
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,510
But this guy has the authority to
solve that to somehow or another,

528
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:33,710
it's become his job. That is exactly
what's going to happen with this bill.

529
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,160
That is exactly what's going to happen
with this. This amount of power.

530
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,220
You can't just give it to be people
and hope they're going to be good.

531
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,430
This should be the fucking

532
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,490
law. You can't do it.
You can't ever do it.

533
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,920
You want a way to stop terrorist threats?

534
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,940
Let's get the fuck out of their
countries. How about that? How about that?

535
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:52,661
That's a good start,

536
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:55,810
but you stop occupying these fucking
countries that don't really need us.

537
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:57,910
We they don't.
No one needs us in Afghanistan.

538
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,870
I want all everybody's relatives
come back fucking home.

539
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,820
Those people that are sending you over,

540
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:06,970
they're not looking out for your best
interest. That's ridiculous. That's right.

541
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:11,830
This is a time old story. It's a timeless
tale. It's been told back and forth.

542
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,400
The last edition was Vietnam, but
apparently nobody fucking learned from it.

543
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,241
Apparently.

544
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:19,600
Everybody just still thinks that
someone's looking out for you at the top,

545
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,320
despite all the evidence to the contrary,
someone's looking out for you, man.

546
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,750
Yeah. Well, and also
there's the, you know,

547
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:30,820
it's set up in a way that for many people
they feel like it's one of their only

548
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:34,420
options is to join the military.
They feel like they, it's like a,

549
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:39,280
they feel like it's going to pay for
their college and it's, um, the, a lot of,

550
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:42,580
you know, I get to it the
fucking, uh, or the UFC,

551
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,100
there'll be a marines there.
You've seen those, right. And,

552
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,140
and we do them for the troops. We do,
we do shows for the troops. Yeah. But,

553
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,810
and we have troops that are flown in
and we get them tickets. No, no, no.

554
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:56,820
That's cool. I'm talking about outside.
The recruiters were there like recording.

555
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,720
Yeah, they're recruiting
people. I don't mean that.

556
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:00,460
It's awesome that fucking at the fights,

557
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,430
the fights where they're recruiting
people and you're all juiced up with

558
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:07,990
testosterone up to seeing a Florida
fucking be tricked into that.

559
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,920
That's not fair.

560
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,210
That's like a whorehouse that's open
right in front of Australia. Yeah. We,

561
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,490
you're like, Whoa, what are you doing
here man? The one, I signed it fruit,

562
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,430
they were doing a pull up
contest is what it was.

563
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:21,680
So they having pullup contest and so
they're getting guys there. It's like,

564
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:24,380
go do a fuck at the hundred pullups look
and they're doing a hundred bullets.

565
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,000
And I'm like, man, you could be
a marine. You're really tough.

566
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,490
You could be a marine.
And so they use,

567
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,190
recruiters will come on college
campuses and you know, it's uh, the,

568
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,920
the United States military
uses, um, many, uh,

569
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:43,600
of the same things that cults do
to indoctrinate the people into it.

570
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:48,020
Uh, you know, cult, uh, change your
identity. They changed your name cults.

571
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,500
We'll shave your head.
They'll make you wear certain clothes.

572
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:53,110
They make you refer to people
in a very specific way.

573
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,930
They make you use a very
specific language in cults.

574
00:31:55,931 --> 00:31:58,600
People will tend to say the
same thing over and over again.

575
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:02,890
That's just based on whatever the
leaders said. So a lot of the, uh,

576
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,870
the indoctrination is very similar to when
Colt's come out to campuses and stuff.

577
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:11,290
It's a very similar thing.
And what they do is they, um,

578
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,320
they get people to join up who haven't
actually considered the reality of what

579
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:19,000
they're going to be doing.

580
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:24,001
Some of them really do want to like
fucking blast goddamn machine guns in the

581
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:25,450
desert cause it's fucking fun.

582
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,950
There's a great book by
Sebastian younger called war. Uh,

583
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,260
and it's fucking awesome if you read that
book. No. Oh my God. It's so good though.

584
00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:39,070
Refresh my memory. He decided to write
a book about, it's this deadly valley,

585
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,680
Afghanistan and it,
and so he decided to write his name.

586
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,160
Sebastian Junger. I don't know
if it's younger, a younger,

587
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,950
he's written other things before
the renewal. Yes. Yup. That's right.

588
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:52,310
I don't know what else though, but I, this
is, I just kept hearing about this book,

589
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:56,210
so I was just trying to remember what I
remembered about it. I can, he's like,

590
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,360
he lived with these fucking
troops out there. He's bad ass.

591
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:04,130
He's like a really tough dude who like,
goes deep into the shit and like, um,

592
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,290
and uh, he's a journal. He's
a war turn on the CNN guy. He,

593
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:11,300
is he the guy that has like the accent?
I don't know. Look at Australian accent.

594
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,150
Is that the guy? I don't think he has an
Australian accent, but I could be wrong.

595
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:16,020
I only saw one interview with them.
I don't remember.

596
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:17,300
I'm going to want to
keep interrupting you.

597
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:21,050
I'm trying to remember this summer camp.
Sorry. So his, what he did with his book,

598
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:22,940
which is remarkable and beautiful,

599
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:27,860
is he managed to write the book with
no moral or ethical slant to it.

600
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,850
You know, he's not saying like war
is bad or you shouldn't go to war.

601
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:33,740
You should go to war.
War is good.

602
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,860
It's just describing the experience
of war is purely as he can.

603
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,460
Exactly what it's like to get hit by a
roadside bomb or exactly what it's like

604
00:33:43,461 --> 00:33:48,461
to like be in the middle of a firefight
and how they've studied adrenaline

605
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:52,460
levels when you get into firefights.
Okay. No, I'm, I'm remembering.

606
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:54,620
I'm going looking at the
pictures of them online. Yeah.

607
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:58,490
I saw him on a CNN interview,
CNN or c span.

608
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,810
They also did a documentary about it too,
about this group of people.

609
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:05,000
He's bad ass fucking marines
out in the middle of it.

610
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,520
Like in the deadliest fucking valley.

611
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,680
It's called the Korengal valley
is what it's called. Those guys,

612
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:13,760
those embedded reporter guys are
fucking crazy. Fucking crazy man.

613
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:17,930
But what a nutty job. Huh? They
want to go where the action is.

614
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,990
Yeah man. But the, the, the,

615
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:24,950
the experience of war for a young guy
who he says there's no drug like it.

616
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,890
He says that there's
nothing that you will,

617
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,950
that will get you as high is being in
a city life or death situation where

618
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:35,060
you're defending your, the people around
you, who you are like connected to.

619
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:36,200
There really are your brothers.

620
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,550
You're like surrounded or you're with
these people. See for for the troops,

621
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,100
that's what their war is there.

622
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:46,590
War is protecting their dear
friends from getting killed and,

623
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,300
and that's how they're taught. They're
taught, these are your brothers.

624
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,580
You will give up your life for your
brothers. That's what they're taught. And,

625
00:34:53,581 --> 00:34:57,830
and so you develop these intense bonds
for the people around you that are formed

626
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,720
from massive burst of adrenaline.
You know, cause like when adrenaline,

627
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,680
when your body is experiencing
super dangerous situations,

628
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,200
all the senses turn on.
It's,

629
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:12,320
I think it's an evolutionary
trait designed to like
teach you so that you learn

630
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,450
how to survive. Like
you know, way back when,

631
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:17,480
if you're getting attacked by a tiger,
you would re you,

632
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:20,210
you know how you remember
everything in a dangerous situation.

633
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,300
Everything becomes crystal clear.
You see everything,

634
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:27,260
everything's kind of in slow motion and
then afterwards you totally remember it

635
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:29,300
with this vividness that you
don't remember other things.

636
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,680
This is where a post traumatic
stress disorder, shock disorder,

637
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,250
post traumatic stress disorder comes
from is that people are getting really

638
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,090
intense situations in war.

639
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,290
They get these fucking memories
burnt into their brains like tattoos.

640
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,740
They can't forget it.
Then their mind keeps going back to it.

641
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,530
Like when your memory wanders
and you think back to a moment,

642
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,760
it's kind of dulled and the colors are
dim and you don't remember their memories

643
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:56,460
go back to it 100% so
it's like they're their,

644
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:00,390
their heart start racing and it fucks
up your life because this thing has been

645
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:01,470
burned into your mind.

646
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:06,300
So in these situations you're experiencing
life at its super high voltage and

647
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:09,810
you're experiencing with a group of people
and you form bonds with these people

648
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:13,320
that you don't have with normal,
with normal people in life.

649
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,210
You inform these intense bonds.

650
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:19,560
Maybe it's like the kind of bonds you
form when you're with your wife and she's

651
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:22,920
giving birth or something. When you're
in sharing those moments with people,

652
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:26,640
it's like that. So I
think the there, you know,

653
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,930
these affects are studied by the people
whose job it is to make the troops

654
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:34,980
efficient and they use these really
intense conditioning techniques and stuff

655
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,730
that a lot of these people
aren't prepared for it.

656
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,210
They don't know what they're getting into.

657
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,270
They don't know that they're getting into
more than just defending their country.

658
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:47,450
They're getting into a well studied system
of brainwashing and conditioning that

659
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:49,980
transforms them from,
you know,

660
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:54,981
normal American citizens and the people
who are willing to die for whatever

661
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:59,100
their commander says, you can't
question what your commander says.

662
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,810
You can't question whoever the superior
officer is about doing this or that you

663
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:06,540
have to do it or couldn't
work if that wasn't the case.

664
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,870
If like each individual person got to
decide, oh, I don't think I'm going to,

665
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,990
I don't think I'm going to
shoot that fucking grenade, man,

666
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,120
I don't want to do that. I don't think
I, you know what the place down there,

667
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,140
all the people are with the
guns that want to kill me.

668
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,890
I'm probably not going to go there today.

669
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,330
It's amazing how easy it is to sell the
idea that you're supposed to go kill

670
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:27,150
someone because some
people that are in office,

671
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:30,830
even though you know that everyone in
office is essentially corrupted the,

672
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,850
but because those people were in off of,
they tell you,

673
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:37,440
you're allowed to kill these people. Not
only, uh, are you allowed to kill people,

674
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,080
but when you come back they'll
be happy to see you. Yeah, sure.

675
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,300
It's like in any other time, if you find
out that other guy killed somebody, like,

676
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:47,940
look, you know, this fucking
guy, man, he's a good dude.

677
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:49,560
But he went to jail for manslaughter.

678
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,010
He beat some guy to death in front of
a nightclub and he's kind of fucked up

679
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:55,500
with Jill for 10 years. You, you like,
I don't want to be around that guy.

680
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,430
They're going to kill somebody.
But if you are around a war hero,

681
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,780
so different feelings, different
feelings for them too. You know, I mean,

682
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:07,200
some guys have have issues over it,
but I've met guys that don't,

683
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:11,850
I know some really smart guys that went
overseas and they're happy that they did

684
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:16,500
what they did. 58 confirmed kills
dude. I know some snipers. Yeah,

685
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,050
I know one dude very well. There
was a slight bro. Well, I mean,

686
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,550
you gotta be a weird thing,
man.

687
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:24,390
To be looked at someone from a distance
and make them disappear from Earth.

688
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,010
Blend from a distance. You know,
it's, that's what it is. I mean,

689
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,150
that's what being a sniper is.

690
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:33,960
You're not there to fucking good when
the target content playing pinball,

691
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:36,040
you're there to pack
people off if they want

692
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,900
to kill, operate people's heads. Yeah,
you're, you explode their brain. Yeah.

693
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:45,180
You, you're a widow maker. You're out
there fucking making kids grow up,

694
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,680
grow up without their debt. You're out
there fucking making it so that like, uh,

695
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,140
for the rest of their lives,

696
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:53,770
there's going to be sentimental moments
where a guy looks at a grainy picture of

697
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:58,450
the person whose face you just turned
to jelly and bone fragments for the rest

698
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:01,000
of their life. They're going to be looking
at this picture of being like, man,

699
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:05,260
I wonder what my dad was like. I bet he
was pretty fucking cool. Oh, guess what?

700
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,620
You're not going to know his fucking
head looks like a goddamn blast.

701
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,750
A tomato that fell off a car, his
head splattered everywhere. That's it.

702
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,310
And a professional did that.

703
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:20,050
Who got trained in a fucking camp designed
to teach people to do that and the

704
00:39:20,051 --> 00:39:23,380
most precise way
possible. It's crazy, man.

705
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,240
It's amazing when you
break it down like that.

706
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:28,840
When you look at it for what the
actual physical act of it is,

707
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:32,680
instead of looking at it as a patriotic
American supports everything that we do

708
00:39:32,681 --> 00:39:36,250
overseas and you know, put a fucking
flag on your window. It says,

709
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:40,210
God bless our troops. You know, instead
of just looking at it analytically,

710
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,420
not even like casting a blame
just described as describing it.

711
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,490
You just just describe it.
It becomes insanity.

712
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,160
It becomes a point where people
were angry at you and they will say,

713
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:51,850
you're talking shit about the American
soldiers and the U s army. Well,

714
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:54,640
you actually not even,
you don't even have to.

715
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,920
All you have to do is just
describe what's happening.

716
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,670
You don't have to talk any shit
when you describe what's happening.

717
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:05,820
The reality of the details is so horrific
that people will interrupt you with

718
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:10,060
excuses. Sure. Interrupt you. All you
have to do is say what's happened,

719
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:14,170
not even cast blame.
Just describe it accurately.

720
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,670
What you're doing there.

721
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:18,880
See as you're walking through the laser
in the museum that makes the fucking

722
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,490
doors shut in front of the diamond.
You know,

723
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:25,120
it's like people have these trip wires
in their brains where the moment you

724
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:28,180
start talking about just the stuff
we've been talking about now it's,

725
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,430
you're hitting a fucking icon.

726
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,570
You're hitting some conditioning that's
been intentionally put there. Um,

727
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,000
that's been intentionally
put there because if it's
not there, then you know, uh,

728
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:41,590
the country can't function as an empire.
I mean, it's got, you've got to have,

729
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,090
if you're going to run an empire,

730
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,480
the population has got to have deep
and intense admiration for the military

731
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:50,290
force because if they don't,

732
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:53,260
then the military force isn't going to
function because the military forces made

733
00:40:53,261 --> 00:40:56,830
up of the population. But it becomes, at
a certain point, Tom, you have to wonder,

734
00:40:56,831 --> 00:41:00,640
when does the military force realize
these guys that are paying you absolute

735
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:04,360
shit money and the guys that we
have to do foundations for it,

736
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:09,190
we have to do a benefits for, you know,
to, for a traumatic brain injuries.

737
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,070
You know, like people have to have help
and contribute. That should, to me,

738
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:16,180
when I found out that they need money for
traumatic brain injuries for hospitals

739
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,260
to deal with these guys,

740
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,960
when they come back overseas
with these horrible injuries,

741
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,140
the first thing I thought is,
man, how is that possible?

742
00:41:23,141 --> 00:41:25,570
They let that become an issue.

743
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,530
How much would that cost in comparison
to how much fucking money they're making

744
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:32,170
over there? How much would it
cost and who's making money?

745
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,950
How about the fucking
people that are making the,

746
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,460
all the equipment he'll sell on the
caliber and the people that make the air

747
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,020
conditioning machines,
there's,

748
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,340
they're spending billions of dollars on
air conditioning over there. You know,

749
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:46,010
giant tents that they're fucking air
conditioning. There's a lot of my,

750
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,000
you're telling me they don't have any
money to spend on traumatic brain injury.

751
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,571
We shouldn't.

752
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:54,950
They like invest in the best medicine
possible with a smart scientists.

753
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,410
How much would that cost?
Would that be cost prohibitive?

754
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,520
If that's cost prohibitive,

755
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:01,490
then that the means of fucking
war should be cost prohibitive.

756
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,280
You shouldn't be investing in a war
that you can't take care of your fucking

757
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:07,430
soldiers after it's over. What
the fuck is that? That's like,

758
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,250
that's like driving across the country
with just enough money for gas and no

759
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:11,040
money for fights.

760
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,160
The most fucked up thing ever man. It's
like, and, and that's the, that is the,

761
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,590
the real sickening thing about it is
whenever you run into people who are

762
00:42:19,591 --> 00:42:23,400
soldiers, like, like that guy, there
was a coolest fucking guy at the,

763
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:24,960
her Moses show he did man.

764
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:29,250
He like said he listened to your podcast
and like he was like in a special

765
00:42:29,251 --> 00:42:33,210
forces guy and he was fucking cool man.
And every time I run into those people,

766
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,000
they're cool and an
authentic way or you know,

767
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:38,700
you could be good friends with these
people. You could trust these people

768
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:42,530
there. You have to have a
tremendous character to get
through the special forces,

769
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:46,340
the green berets. You don't say what you
will about someone, you know, being a,

770
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:50,000
you know, a soldier who's a, you know, a
puppet of a giant corporation, whatever,

771
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,010
to be like a special forces soldier, you
need to be a bad motherfucker. Period.

772
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:55,350
Yeah.

773
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,460
Do you man,
and those people are like some of our,

774
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,300
there's some of our best people.
Yeah. You're really, really are.

775
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:02,860
There's some of our best fucking people.

776
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,920
So to send them off to bullshit wars
where they're getting fucking liquified

777
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:12,310
instead of using them for real purpose,
for something,

778
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:16,750
for like really building the country up
and really do like for in the inevitable

779
00:43:16,751 --> 00:43:19,780
event where some shit is going to happen
and we're going to need them for real

780
00:43:19,781 --> 00:43:24,340
thing, you know, to send
them to waste them for these
fucking politicians who are,

781
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:29,020
who are the real pop of the corporations
to fucking send these heroes off to get

782
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:33,130
their faces blown off in some country
that they don't need to be. Man,

783
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,690
that is beyond evil.

784
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:38,920
That's some Rep Tilian
vampiric weird shit man.

785
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:42,130
It is. It is. Yeah, it is.
It's, it's if, you know,

786
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:44,410
if they were eating people
instead of just killing them,

787
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,850
if every person that died, they
ate, we would be horrified. Right,

788
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,230
because everybody just dies.
Yeah. Somehow or another,

789
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:53,170
it doesn't seem like the kitten
killed by monsters. No, they are.

790
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,120
They're being killed by
psychological monsters.

791
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:58,690
They've been killed by people who are
willing to kill people in order to profit.

792
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,410
And it's really that simple and it
doesn't seem like it should be possible in

793
00:44:02,411 --> 00:44:05,500
2011 but that's the
business that they're in.

794
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,050
The guy who works at the
fucking butcher shop,

795
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,940
the guy who works at the slaughterhouse.
Okay.

796
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,490
Do you think that guy at
a certain point in time,

797
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,030
don't you think he gets used
to killing cows? The fuck,
yeah, he does. It's his job.

798
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,360
But if you had to go
there today and the like,

799
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,150
you just were alone with the cow and all
this machinery and then there was like

800
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:23,350
a fucking manual,

801
00:44:23,351 --> 00:44:27,250
the told you exactly how you pull the cow
into this and lead them into this spot

802
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:31,260
and then send the piston through his
fucking brain and then hook them up and

803
00:44:31,261 --> 00:44:31,920
then got him.

804
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,090
You'd be so freaked out at the whole
process because you're not used to it

805
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,400
because it's not,
it's not a normal yeah.

806
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,420
Part of your life. Yeah. Meanwhile, yeah,
so these people are just used to it there.

807
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:43,940
They just make sense to them and yeah,

808
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:47,100
it's a normal part of their
lives and normal part of
their life, man. It's in it.

809
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,680
It's like when you hear about the friends
of Bush that got all those deals and

810
00:44:51,681 --> 00:44:52,401
Afghanistan,

811
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:56,430
all the contractors and Shitty I to
like the and how much they charge for a

812
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:59,210
workout there that they charge,
like saying money,

813
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:04,450
money for this stuff and you realize, oh,
this is just a, you know, the act of war.

814
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:09,200
It's just a way to test out some
new technology and to, uh, get,

815
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,450
get a lot of people, some work and
make a lot of people really writ,

816
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,600
yeah, incredibly rich. And the
idea that everybody, you know,

817
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,390
people say there's no way that people
would go to war just for money.

818
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,400
And I'm like,
there's no way they wouldn't,

819
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,510
there's no way they wouldn't if they had
to sacrifice a few thousand people here

820
00:45:25,511 --> 00:45:29,350
or there to make untold
trillions amount of dollars.

821
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,830
That is what it is too. Yeah. Yeah.
That's funny. Cause if it was like,

822
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:37,780
let's say there was just a group of like
robed a demonic magicians that lived in

823
00:45:37,781 --> 00:45:39,970
some giant black tower and they're like,
okay,

824
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,960
we need 5,000 of your
strongest and brave as men.

825
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:48,370
We're going to sacrifice them at the
top of the tower and from their blood,

826
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:53,050
we will reap great energy. You'd be like,
fuck here. That's the evilest thing ever.

827
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:53,720
But if they're like,

828
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,250
we got to send our troops over there
to defend and fight for our country,

829
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,800
suddenly you're like, oh yeah, totally.
Makes Sense. Go ahead and do that.

830
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:02,820
They're going to fight for your freedom.
We're pigs, man. Listen to fucking,

831
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:07,400
I was the Ozzy Osborne. He sums it
up perfectly in that sock. Yeah.

832
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,180
Why the war machine keeps turning.
Yeah.

833
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,550
It is a war machine. And that's
something that, you know,

834
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:17,540
people have warned us about from the
beginning of time. You know, there's,

835
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,080
you know, people that are in
charge, they're like everything.

836
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:25,040
They're going to eventually get drunk
with power and they're going to lead you

837
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:29,660
in some terrible direction
at all. Corruption evolves.
And if it's not checked,

838
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:33,710
it gets stronger and stronger and all
you have to do is just go back to the

839
00:46:33,711 --> 00:46:37,400
Kennedy assassination.
Go back to Lyndon Johnson,

840
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:42,020
go back to Richard Nixon and
Watergate and they're, oh,

841
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:43,150
crux.
Yeah.

842
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:47,870
They've always been crooks and no one
got caught a few along the way. Nixon,

843
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:51,680
a few guys got popped for a little
bit of this and a little bit of that,

844
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,320
but for the most part,
everybody got away with everything.

845
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:57,590
The people who drafted up the Northwoods
document, they didn't go to jail.

846
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,580
Whoever the fuck shot Kennedy.
Ooh,

847
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,100
it was Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.
Yeah, sure he did. Sure he did.

848
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,090
Yeah. All those people that heard
bullets coming from behind them,

849
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,120
they're just crazy. Yeah.
They're just silly people.

850
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,150
That was fucking probably like
five or six dudes with guns.

851
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:18,110
They think they've got to rely on one guy.
And do you think that one guy really,

852
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,560
really was on his own?
Just a lone nut?

853
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,390
Yeah,
we shut the fuck up.

854
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,420
Which is why when you see John Mccain
or pretty much directly telling Paul the

855
00:47:30,101 --> 00:47:32,320
yes with this bill,

856
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:36,790
if someone is a threat to the
security of the United States,

857
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,090
you know John Mccain,

858
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:43,090
this is from the person who fucking
chose Sarah Pailin as his vice president.

859
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,470
So that's how fucked up this man
is. When you hear him saying, yeah,

860
00:47:47,471 --> 00:47:52,471
we can indefinitely arrest United
States citizens who are a threat to the

861
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:56,080
security of this country.
You have to ask, well,

862
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,470
what is John Mccain's definition
of security? I know what mine is.

863
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,170
What's John Mccain's definition
of the security of this country?

864
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:07,030
Because I think it's wildly different
from my idea and your idea and for most

865
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:10,150
people's idea of the security of the
country. I think for John Mccain,

866
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:15,280
the security of the country means that
the corporations are able to function

867
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,260
without getting disturbed by people who
have the gall or audacity to say that,

868
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:21,094
uh,

869
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:26,130
the way that wealth is distributed right
now is unfair and is fucking up. Uh,

870
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:26,841
uh,
is,

871
00:48:26,841 --> 00:48:30,160
is basically eating away in eroding
the foundations of what this country is

872
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:31,030
supposed to be about.

873
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:36,100
I think fucking McCain would very much
like to take those people and put them in

874
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:41,080
some indefinite detainment.
Um, if he could,

875
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:44,290
and eventually, maybe it won't be
Mccain. Maybe it won't be this year.

876
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,520
Maybe when this bill passes,
it'll be 15 years before it happens.

877
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:50,620
But eventually people
just start disappearing.

878
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,110
People will vanish in
the middle of the night.

879
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,130
Did you hear about this fucking
ridiculous thing that Newt Gingrich said?

880
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,850
Gary Johnson outed a Newt
Gingrich about, uh, being a,

881
00:49:02,851 --> 00:49:05,780
a pot smoker and the fact that he,
uh,

882
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:10,810
was pushing for some thing that would
make marijuana distribution after a

883
00:49:11,151 --> 00:49:12,070
certain amount,
like a,

884
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,300
with a certain volume would make it a law.

885
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:20,300
You would be able to be put to death,
essentially,

886
00:49:20,301 --> 00:49:23,450
you'd be eligible for the death penalty.
This newt Gingrich,

887
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,210
the guy who had missed it,
he had smoked pot.

888
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:30,980
He's talking about like pot dealers at
wow. Gary Johnson outdid them on this.

889
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:33,830
Right. So yeah, so new. So
right. And those are made.

890
00:49:33,831 --> 00:49:37,280
There are many people right now we're
in control of this country. Who, okay.

891
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,440
Oh, how crazy is that? It's evil.

892
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,630
Or imagine that someone's saying that
you are a guy who sells pot because he

893
00:49:44,631 --> 00:49:49,220
sells a lot of it. What? He
sells one joint. Wow. One
joint. No death penalty. Okay.

894
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:53,150
I've saw a million joints. Death penalty
off with is, hey, you know why? Why?

895
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,460
Because you're giving
more people the same shit.

896
00:49:55,461 --> 00:49:57,530
That doesn't even make any sense.
I've never understood that.

897
00:49:57,531 --> 00:50:01,430
The idea of like a volume
issue makes the crime worse.

898
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,230
Like give your cell on a couple
of joints to your friends.

899
00:50:03,231 --> 00:50:04,280
It's like a little slap on the wrist.

900
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:07,580
But if you're selling a hundred thousand
pounds in the back of a semi, yeah,

901
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,770
you're going to, you're going to get
locked up for the rest of your life.

902
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,030
Take it a little further back.
Yeah.

903
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:15,350
You're talking about a fucking farmer.
You're going to execute a farmer.

904
00:50:15,351 --> 00:50:19,040
It's agriculture. Malaria, shit grows
out of the ground. You, you want to,

905
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:22,860
you're going to execute a fucking
guy who like, who is a horticulture?

906
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,580
Is there a botanist? You're just
gonna. You're going to kill somebody.

907
00:50:25,581 --> 00:50:29,870
You grew a plant. It's not like he was
whipping up poison. You know what, that's,

908
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:30,853
that's the weird thing.

909
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:35,950
You could probably whip up 500 gallons
of cyanide and distribute that around and

910
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:38,420
you couldn't get the death
penalty for that is deadly.

911
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:42,560
Is that as pure deadly cyanide. But if
you're growing enough fucking marijuana,

912
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,940
uh, Newt Gingrich thinks that
he can. He wants to execute you.

913
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:46,820
He wants to kill you.

914
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:47,661
Speaker of the house.

915
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:52,661
Newt Gingrich introduced in 1997 the
drug importer death penalty act of 1996 a

916
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:59,150
builder of acquired a sentence of death
for certain importations of significant

917
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:01,100
quantities of controlled substances.

918
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,080
It would have applied to
anyone convicted more than one,

919
00:51:04,081 --> 00:51:09,081
so carrying a hundred doses or about two
ounces of marijuana across the board,

920
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:13,610
or two ounces of marijuana
across the border. 100 doses.

921
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:17,780
That would be the death penalty.
You'd be eligible for death. Yeah.

922
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:22,580
What a monkey.
What an old limp Dick Monkey.

923
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:27,260
Just you old dumb fuck you.
You ancient thinking shithead.

924
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,110
You fucking rule maker.

925
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:35,000
You write it down and everyone knocks
the hammer and then it makes it right.

926
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:39,110
Your fucking system is obviously bullshit.
All of it's bullshit.

927
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:44,000
So your laws are bullshit. All your rules
are bullshit. All this posse comitatus,

928
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,230
comitatus, whatever it is. That's
bullshit too. It's just we just decide,

929
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:52,160
people write things down on paper and we
decide what is right and what wrong and

930
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:56,180
then we know we're not agreeing to this.
We didn't even get to vote any of this.

931
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,320
There's the idea that they can just
impose this on you is nothing short of

932
00:52:00,321 --> 00:52:01,370
imperialism.

933
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,900
It's nothing short of people telling
other people what they can't do.

934
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,460
Telling other people that
they're not, they don't.
They're not as special as them,

935
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,860
that they're not worth
as much as them did.

936
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,870
They don't have any rights that they
don't have any authority and that these

937
00:52:14,871 --> 00:52:19,400
people who write the things down on people
on paper rather all of a sudden have

938
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:23,210
the authority over the mass of other
humans that don't. They're special.

939
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:26,630
They override and now they're
telling us that the override,

940
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:30,470
because they have weapons because
they're going to allow the military to

941
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:35,471
actually enter into civilian
areas and stop uprisings,

942
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,360
so you're going to have tanks
can stop Operation Wall Street.

943
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,230
Literally what happened in Tiananmen
Square that horrified every American when

944
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:47,660
we saw those kids get run
over by tanks and killed,

945
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:52,750
it was terrifying that their government
is so fucking ugh against them,

946
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,760
that their government is so
cool and so evil that he,

947
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,130
they been willing to
run over their citizens,

948
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:03,310
run over the people whose hard
work literally funded the empire,

949
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:07,190
funded these tanks.
Every person chipped in a certain amount,

950
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,950
but because he's people defy,
because these people protest,

951
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,670
they're going to run over him with tanks
and crushed him on television in front

952
00:53:13,671 --> 00:53:14,450
of everybody.

953
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:18,230
That's right. And, and, and that's, that's
the type of person that Newt Gingrich's

954
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:21,650
and that can come, that can come
from this, from this action.

955
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,530
And that's why people don't understand
like why you getting so outraged about

956
00:53:24,531 --> 00:53:29,370
this? Why is this like this is crazy.
This is like a movie. This is like Batman.

957
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:33,240
Okay, we're, we're in Batman
right now and you know, the,

958
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:37,560
the evil people are slowly getting
their grips on our, on our government.

959
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:41,880
There's some guy with a fucking mask on
and he's working for all the bad guys

960
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:45,450
and he's pretending to be a senator and
Batman has to figure this guy out and he

961
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:48,360
has to get to him. And right now
that guy looks like Barack Obama.

962
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,190
Barack Obama was like,
he's got a mask on,

963
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,390
he's like some fucking lizard guy
underneath all this and he's just a really

964
00:53:54,391 --> 00:53:57,600
good actor and he's got everybody
convinced that everything's Cool and David

965
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,910
Eick is right, man. They're
all fucking reptilians.

966
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:03,430
He's kind of like him,
man. It's so ridiculous.

967
00:54:03,431 --> 00:54:07,480
It almost like that would fit right into
the plot if you found out Obama really

968
00:54:07,481 --> 00:54:08,314
was a reptilian.
Yeah.

969
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:11,660
Would it like fit right in the plot of
you found out that new Gingrich really

970
00:54:11,661 --> 00:54:15,860
was some evil reptilian that wanted to
take over the reptile farm. You know,

971
00:54:15,861 --> 00:54:18,590
he doesn't like to leave this
young reptiles runs things.

972
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:23,480
I would run these humans correctly,
you know? Well you can, you know,

973
00:54:23,481 --> 00:54:26,480
before you get to there, fuck.
Before you get to the reptilian part,

974
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:30,590
you can just kind of look at what they
really are and what they really are.

975
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,300
Here's one thing you know about Newt
Gingrich. Newt Gingrich is a murderer.

976
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:39,080
He wants to kill people. Newt Gingrich
feels comfortable killing people.

977
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:42,260
You know that. And you also
know that Newt Gingrich, uh,

978
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:45,620
makes would make money off of that.
Newt Gingrich makes money off of,

979
00:54:45,621 --> 00:54:46,850
would make money off of killing people.

980
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:49,760
The people who support war make
money off of killing people.

981
00:54:49,761 --> 00:54:54,761
They literally transform
human beings into money.

982
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,670
They kill human beings. And that
turns into money and money's energy.

983
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:01,640
So what that means is they're vampires.
That's what they really are.

984
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:02,361
They're vampires.

985
00:55:02,361 --> 00:55:07,361
They or they convert human energy
through destruction into cash,

986
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:12,380
and then they use that cash
to make their lives better.

987
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:17,530
Just like vampires sync their things in
the people suck the blood to stay alive.

988
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:22,910
It's the same thing. It's vampiric gets
a vampiric form of existence. And um,

989
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:28,010
it's really fucking terrifying
when you realize that it's 100%

990
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,710
true. They're not only, is it 100% true?

991
00:55:30,711 --> 00:55:34,370
It doesn't seem to be any way to get
them out other than them dying and young

992
00:55:34,371 --> 00:55:38,270
people taking their place, young people
who grew up with the Internet. Yeah.

993
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,260
Well it seems like a certain
amount of the way the system is.

994
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,960
It's like they've sort of
just accepted it, you know,

995
00:55:44,961 --> 00:55:47,560
and everyone's accepted
that it's just fuck

996
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,350
wash, but you, and you have to think,

997
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,620
I don't think that they're unaware
of the fact of where they're,

998
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,680
where they're fallible.
I think they know where they're fallible.

999
00:55:56,681 --> 00:55:59,590
They can't correct it.
I think that they may be,

1000
00:55:59,591 --> 00:56:02,950
they know what they're doing in a
really intense way because they've had

1001
00:56:02,951 --> 00:56:07,480
infinite amounts of money to study human
psychology and to understand how to

1002
00:56:07,481 --> 00:56:10,930
control populations.
And they got it down to a science man.

1003
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,710
There's a great fucking documentary on
the BBC called the century of the self.

1004
00:56:14,711 --> 00:56:15,730
Have you seen that?
No.

1005
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:20,380
Edward Bernays is this Guy Bernays
who was like Freud's cousin. And,

1006
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,880
um, it's all about the ways
that they started studying,

1007
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,590
how to manipulate,
uh,

1008
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:31,000
the perception of populations for the
sake of corporations. So for example,

1009
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:34,630
cigarette companies approached
Bernays and they're like, listen,

1010
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,510
women don't want to smoke right now
cause they think it's too masculine.

1011
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,290
What do you, what do you think we can do
to make it so that women want to smoke?

1012
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,760
And so Bernays said,
well,

1013
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:45,280
you need to make women feel
like it's a form of activism.

1014
00:56:45,281 --> 00:56:49,510
Are there like pushing against uh,
a male dominated culture?

1015
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:52,570
It's like make it part of the
woman women's rights movement.

1016
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:56,710
So what they did is they got a bunch
of these girls to march during the Macy

1017
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:58,450
date,
Macy's Day parade.

1018
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,030
And at one point they told all the
press that they're going to do this.

1019
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:06,210
At one point the women lifted up their
dresses and like pulled cigarettes out of

1020
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:09,310
their gardens or whatever and started
smoking in front of all these reporters

1021
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:10,570
who were snapping pictures.

1022
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:13,420
And so their reporters put
that in all these newspapers,

1023
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,150
women's women want the right to smoke.

1024
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:20,380
Now all of a sudden what Bernays did or
what the cigarette companies did is they

1025
00:57:20,381 --> 00:57:24,460
tied into the DNA of the
women's rights movement smoking.

1026
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:28,750
So now smoking becomes a empowerment
and empowerment and a sign of feminism.

1027
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:33,150
And all of a sudden women started smoking
and it totally fucking worked. So yeah,

1028
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:37,750
totally work. So, so it's like, so stuff
like Cree now's a long time ago, man.

1029
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:40,600
So he has a long time ago. So
they started studying, you know,

1030
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:41,980
they started studying.
It's just like,

1031
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:47,100
imagine like somebody who herd sheep or
imagine somebody who is in charge of any

1032
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:49,720
kind of animal,
a beekeeper for example,

1033
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:53,500
or anyone who's in charge of
controlling animals. They're experts.

1034
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,070
They know how to like, they know how to
do, like Turkey hunters are the same way.

1035
00:57:57,071 --> 00:57:58,240
They're not in Turkey cause,

1036
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:02,440
and just the perfect way to make
a Turkey appear and to blast it.

1037
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:06,550
So I think that people put a lot of
money into studying human perception.

1038
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:10,960
The way people work. And I
think maybe they, the what,

1039
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:15,250
what we think the amount of control
that we think we wheeled his ma,

1040
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:19,900
it's an illusion. I don't know when I
see those fucking black Friday videos,

1041
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:24,670
you know when you see the black Friday
videos of thousands of people stampeding

1042
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:28,750
through a Walmart banging down the
door of a fucking Walmart like zombies.

1043
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:31,930
If you ever seen that video,
when you see that,

1044
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,900
it's really,
to me it's like man,

1045
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:37,780
I mean maybe you and me and a few
other people have these ideas,

1046
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:42,370
but in general as a herd it seems like
they've gotten people so doped up and

1047
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:44,170
dumbed down that uh,

1048
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,040
I don't know that they're
making too many mistakes.

1049
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,160
I think they make mistakes here and there.
I think they fuck up.

1050
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,400
I think there's a lot of shit that's
going on that is just coincidental and is

1051
00:58:56,401 --> 00:59:00,890
more of a,
a symptom of the,

1052
00:59:00,891 --> 00:59:05,460
the way we've sort of developed
as a society than a grand plan.

1053
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:09,780
And it's more of them filling
in the gaps that were available,

1054
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:13,620
taking, taking advantage of a lot
of situations that are available.

1055
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:18,650
I don't think that it's one gigantic
group with a fucking finger on all the

1056
00:59:19,171 --> 00:59:21,970
marionette handles autonomy.

1057
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,540
I think it's worse than that. I think
it's, you know, the term gets stalled.

1058
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,050
You ever heard that term? Yes.
So I think it's the good stock.

1059
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,210
I think it's like the,
somehow the,

1060
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:34,510
the super consciousness that has emerged
from this group of people collaborating

1061
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:37,790
his car, there's like a, it's,
it's become its own thing.

1062
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:42,650
It's become an organizing force that's
organizing towards the negative and

1063
00:59:42,651 --> 00:59:45,440
towards the vampiric and not
organizing towards the positive.

1064
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:49,430
Did you listen to the, you, you didn't
listen to Bruce Lipton? I didn't.

1065
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,323
It was really interesting.

1066
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:52,820
He was on the podcast yesterday and one
of the things he was talking about was

1067
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,490
the importance of creating a community,
like a good community of,

1068
00:59:57,491 --> 00:59:58,071
of people.

1069
00:59:58,071 --> 01:00:00,680
You feed off their energy and those
people that you're around and you feed off

1070
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:04,250
their energy, you know, if
they're positive, you'll,
you'll actually feel better.

1071
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:08,030
You'll have a more positive light. And
it totally makes sense. Totally. Oh yeah.

1072
01:00:08,031 --> 01:00:12,340
That's, it's, it's the most important.
That's one of the reasons that people, um,

1073
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:16,820
advise, uh, spending time
and Ostrom's they're spending
time around people who are

1074
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:20,230
meditating because you, um, from being
around people who are working on,

1075
01:00:20,231 --> 01:00:21,920
and also it's the same with martial arts.
Do you want it,

1076
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:26,450
if you're around people who are fighters
and you see the different forms and

1077
01:00:26,451 --> 01:00:28,340
styles that they're using,
that's going to,

1078
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:30,890
you're going to evolve just from being
around them and seeing what they're doing.

1079
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:35,270
So techniques. Yeah. I said, yeah,
it w you know, it's like you,

1080
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:37,340
when you learn techniques of thinking too.
Yeah.

1081
01:00:37,341 --> 01:00:40,580
That's one things that people always
comment on this podcast. People, oh,

1082
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:44,930
I get emails and tweets and Facebook
to zone where people are always talking

1083
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:48,710
about how, you know, they don't know
anybody that thinks the way they think.

1084
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,610
They don't have anybody that
has the interest they or
who looks at things in the

1085
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:55,850
just the raw, honest, black
and white view that you see.

1086
01:00:55,851 --> 01:00:59,930
And here's my perceptions and it's not
flavored by what's politically correct

1087
01:00:59,931 --> 01:01:02,450
and it's not flavored
by, you know, what's, uh,

1088
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,640
what's thought to be
a acceptable behavior.

1089
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:08,120
It's what I really think and I want to
know if you think the same thing and when

1090
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:11,000
when you do that people,
it resonates with people.

1091
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:16,220
They don't know anybody else who's doing
that. All right. Well, um, so yeah,

1092
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:19,880
so, so right. So in that same
way that like this podcast has,

1093
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:24,350
because of the incredible connection it's
given me with like Shitload to fucking

1094
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,560
people,
uh,

1095
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:30,830
my evolution sped up because I'm
constantly getting like amazing videos,

1096
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:34,400
book recommendations, basic things
from Blake's, Twitter lists,

1097
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:35,540
all the crazy stories.

1098
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,830
So it's certainly altered me
and I and it for the positive.

1099
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:43,880
Now imagine 100% of many of me as well,
you know, as I've been a part of it,

1100
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,370
you know, as like doing the
podcast, being a part of it,

1101
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:48,980
it's completely enhanced my,

1102
01:01:48,981 --> 01:01:52,040
my perception of things and
people have cleared up, uh,

1103
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:53,900
things that I didn't understand before.

1104
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:57,290
People have sent me alternative points
of view that also should be considered.

1105
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,760
Like there's so many interesting bits
of information they keep coming at you

1106
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:05,090
from all these different forums. Right.
It's great. It's creating a feedback loop.

1107
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,110
What I was getting at is that this what
these people have put together with the

1108
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:12,470
people involved in the military industrial
complex and put together is a very

1109
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:15,950
high level evil version of that.
That's it man.

1110
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:20,130
But they have a high level evil version
of thinking where everyone is thinking

1111
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,780
along the same way.

1112
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:25,980
And you have to make sacrifices and
you got to crack some eggs to make an

1113
01:02:25,981 --> 01:02:29,720
Omelette. And all of this
thinking is put into like a,

1114
01:02:29,721 --> 01:02:34,080
a mindset. And that mindset
is enforced into the troops,

1115
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:38,760
beaten into their head, supported through
the ranks, applied to corporations

1116
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:39,940
and,
and many of them.

1117
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:44,170
And it's really like when you consider
that many of the people at the top of the,

1118
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:49,210
uh, power structures are fundamental
is Christians. It's hilarious.

1119
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,060
Now imagine this, imagine that they
weren't fundamentalist Christians.

1120
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:56,710
Imagine they were just, you know,
cultists and they believed in a dark God.

1121
01:02:56,711 --> 01:03:01,160
They worshiped at dark art and this dark
God was a child sacrifice or, and, uh,

1122
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:06,050
sacrificed its own son at one point,
spelled the blood of its own son, um,

1123
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:09,250
out of some sense of obligation or power.

1124
01:03:09,251 --> 01:03:14,080
And that they were praying and worshiping
daily to a dark God who was planning

1125
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:18,340
revenge on the majority of the human race
and was right now at this very moment,

1126
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:23,380
planning and getting ready to destroy
the planet with plagues and different and

1127
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:28,180
horsemen and trumpets and
weird like crazy fucking, uh,

1128
01:03:28,181 --> 01:03:31,660
angels that were going to fly down and
kill and poison the largest of the earth.

1129
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,430
And they're worshiping this guy daily.

1130
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:38,580
They go to church and worship a god
that wants to destroy the planet every

1131
01:03:38,621 --> 01:03:41,800
fucking day. They pray
to this God, oh Lord,

1132
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:46,960
give me the courage to lead today so that
I may be prepared for when you were a

1133
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:51,070
turn and destroy the planet. That's
who they fucking pray to, man.

1134
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:55,540
That's God. They pray to God. They pray
to a God that wants to wipe us out.

1135
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:58,510
Throw us in hell,
kill the fucking homosexuals,

1136
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,400
destroy the majority of the planet.

1137
01:04:00,401 --> 01:04:04,990
So all that's left is a few John Mccain's
style honkies where their feet a river

1138
01:04:04,991 --> 01:04:08,620
of blood waving up at
Gabriel are worshiping God.

1139
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:12,070
Like I'm walking down the streets
of gold waving American flags.

1140
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:15,460
That's the freaks. Who are, a lot of them
are running this fucking country, man,

1141
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:19,330
that ain't good. That's
not good. That's bad.

1142
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:24,420
I don't want anyone having access to a
nuclear arsenal that worships at God.

1143
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,990
That's planning on,

1144
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:30,790
it's some random time blasting the
planet I'm living on and wiping out the

1145
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:34,360
majority of the people because he's
pissed about what they did do is fucking

1146
01:04:34,361 --> 01:04:39,040
Hippie kid 22,000 years
ago. Like, come on man,

1147
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:42,520
forget about it. I'm, I wasn't
alive back then. I can't help it.

1148
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,000
They fucking threw your kid up on a cross.
I had nothing to do with it.

1149
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:49,240
Why are you coming back to kill
their descendants? You weirdo.

1150
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:50,950
You us the fucking break.

1151
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,300
You're God traveled back in time and
pluck them off the fucking cross, man.

1152
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:58,110
Yeah, and this need controlling
this whole game, doesn't he?

1153
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,330
How can you just give it come down
and give us better directions?

1154
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:04,870
He just gives you this game and you just
fuck this game up and you're supposed

1155
01:05:04,871 --> 01:05:08,650
to read some old manual and how to play
the game and it's interpreted through

1156
01:05:08,651 --> 01:05:10,480
three different languages
and it was just a,

1157
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:14,050
a spoken word thing for a
thousand years before that.

1158
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:17,260
So who knows how much of it's fucking
valid and this is how you playing game and

1159
01:05:17,261 --> 01:05:18,220
you're fucking up along

1160
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,300
the way and everybody is telling you,

1161
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:21,580
you keep fucking up and he's going to
come and he's going to take you away.

1162
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,710
He's going to take you away and
I'm going to put you in a dark,

1163
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,430
dark place forever. But this is thoughts
and they have these ideas, these urges,

1164
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,810
and they seem to be natural.
You better stop Presto's fuck.

1165
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:35,990
I want to fuck all the time.
Don't do it. Go to house.

1166
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:40,300
This guy's an asshole. I want to kill
him. You can't do it. You can't kill him.

1167
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,970
And that's the most amazing
thing that these same people,

1168
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:46,870
all of a sudden you're allowed to
kill him if some sanction group says,

1169
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:49,480
absolutely you can do.
You can even say you're doing it for God.

1170
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:54,250
May God bless you all. Wow. God,
God is blessing us to go Jackson.

1171
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:55,084
People we don't know

1172
01:05:55,170 --> 01:05:58,590
their God, their God. I
called their God loon, loon,

1173
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:01,000
and it's this weird fucking creature.

1174
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:03,810
It reminds me of an HP
Lovecraft demon spirit.

1175
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:07,170
If you change the name of their guy
or their guy doesn't have a name,

1176
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:10,050
that's the name, it's a name was
God. It's like out of fucking cone.

1177
01:06:10,051 --> 01:06:13,920
And it's a nameless. It's an
invisible, nameless God. Yeah.

1178
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:16,490
And they worshiped the invisible,
nameless God, and, and,

1179
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:21,500
and part of worshiping the invisible
nameless God is a sending kids off to war

1180
01:06:23,311 --> 01:06:25,770
and fucking letting the kids kill people.

1181
01:06:25,771 --> 01:06:29,640
And another part of worshiping the
invisible nameless God is making it to gay

1182
01:06:29,641 --> 01:06:33,810
people can't get married. The invisible
nameless one. You know what he hates Joe?

1183
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:38,550
What he fucking hates but sex. Damn.
Why did you make it feel so good?

1184
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:43,080
One with no name. He curses
the gays. The one with no name.

1185
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:44,640
He doesn't like bud sex.

1186
01:06:44,641 --> 01:06:47,490
He's like really upsetting the
end of the little Richard Song.

1187
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,680
Tutti frutti used to be Tutti.
Frutti good booty.

1188
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:54,030
No, it didn't to the fruit it, that's
why I, that's why little Richard is his,

1189
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:58,460
his booties. He's eternally
damned by this fucking Luma.

1190
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:02,220
Tutti Frutti good booty evil man.
He's an evil man.

1191
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:07,290
Did you see that damn cartoon I made
by the way? No. Jesus heals a gay, no,

1192
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:08,570
I like read did like a,

1193
01:07:08,571 --> 01:07:12,750
I took an old Christian cartoon of Jesus
healing a leper and just replace the

1194
01:07:12,751 --> 01:07:16,760
words with him. Healing a homicide.
She'll hold it up. Hold it up. Who isn't?

1195
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,000
I didn't like four hours.

1196
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:22,500
So it ain't looking at
professional fucking going
to be known enough to give me

1197
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:23,390
a thank you to be now.

1198
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,230
Sorry. Don't you know I have to
qualify it first. You're so humble. No,

1199
01:07:28,231 --> 01:07:30,630
I will when I have to
be. This is not a, hey,

1200
01:07:30,631 --> 01:07:34,550
we should talk about that sketch that
you did. That's like the I got you.

1201
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,840
I'm going to get you
sucker. Oh yeah, please.

1202
01:07:36,841 --> 01:07:38,760
Let's clear that's clear that because uh,

1203
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:43,830
I know for a fact that Dunkin did not
remember that thing when he made that

1204
01:07:43,831 --> 01:07:47,070
sketch. And I also know because I
didn't remember that sketch and that,

1205
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:51,300
what are you talking about? Dunkin made
a video with Natasha, a hilarious video.

1206
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:53,760
What's it called? Uh, it's
called falling apart. Falling.

1207
01:07:53,761 --> 01:07:57,610
You're Padam teeth and the
idea of the video, there's,

1208
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:01,840
there's a scene where the girl starts
taking off fake parts and there's a scene

1209
01:08:01,841 --> 01:08:03,780
in, I'm going to get
you sucka. Where is it?

1210
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:07,290
The same thing happened where
he's alone with this girl Keenan.

1211
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:10,290
Ivory Wayans is alone with his check and
she starts taking off all those parts.

1212
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,630
I completely forgot about that.

1213
01:08:12,631 --> 01:08:16,280
Even though I'm a big fan of Keenan
Ivory Wayans and know I saw that movie,

1214
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:21,260
I completely forgot about it and I know
the Dunkin did not know about it because

1215
01:08:21,261 --> 01:08:24,320
when he, first of all, I know Dunkin,
he would never do something like that.

1216
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:26,550
You're one of the most,
you have some of them.

1217
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:30,560
The most clear artistic integrity out
of almost anybody that I've ever met.

1218
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:31,791
It's you're,

1219
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:35,180
you're 100% legit and what you do to
the point where you wouldn't even do the

1220
01:08:35,181 --> 01:08:37,280
Pauly shore reality show.
That's true.

1221
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:41,900
He walked away from a money
job on a television show
where he was going to be on

1222
01:08:41,901 --> 01:08:44,340
a reality show cause he [inaudible] thing.

1223
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:46,780
I would like to say there was no money.
It was a,

1224
01:08:46,781 --> 01:08:49,960
it wasn't like I was walking away from.
It would have benefited the pop,

1225
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:52,580
but have benefited you. I thought,
Oh, I thought you get paid for it.

1226
01:08:52,581 --> 01:08:56,360
You wouldn't get oh no money at all.
I don't think that's legal.

1227
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:58,370
I don't even think that's
legal to put you on television.

1228
01:08:58,371 --> 01:09:01,130
I think they have to give you, they have
to give you like some after a minimum.

1229
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,200
That's what I thought.
Because there was a documentary,

1230
01:09:03,201 --> 01:09:06,320
technically they weren't going to pay.
It's a documentary,

1231
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,470
but it was all scripted. Everything
he did with script, how is my feeling?

1232
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:12,260
They was all scripted. That
was my feeling. But they all,

1233
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:14,740
they do that with all these
reality shows when they create it,

1234
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:17,040
things for them to do well I think,

1235
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,940
I think in the dilemmas in the long run,

1236
01:09:19,941 --> 01:09:22,990
maybe someone could have contested it
or something, but really if it, if it,

1237
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:25,940
if there had been money I
would've still walked away,

1238
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:28,730
could have been a good show and he could
have been a good show if it wasn't what

1239
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:32,030
it was was a Pauly shore
showcase if could have been,

1240
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:37,270
was like a real realistic viewpoint of
all these dudes who are doing standup are

1241
01:09:37,401 --> 01:09:41,930
out there scratching that real
intense creative environment.

1242
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:44,180
That was that comedy store
man. There was, there was some,

1243
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:46,190
you know when we were around back then,

1244
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:49,400
the comedy store with you and me
and Dheas and Ari and you know,

1245
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:54,070
there's a lot of good guys. They're, it's
fucking great right now. I mean like,

1246
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:56,840
and believe you, it's fucking really
good there right now. The crowds are,

1247
01:09:56,841 --> 01:10:01,530
it's packed. It's got a really
cool vibe. But like, but that,

1248
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,070
that fucking poly thing, man, it was like,

1249
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:08,000
there was a lot of reasons that I
walked away from that and at one of the

1250
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:11,480
biggest ones, um, aside from
the fact that I did not want,

1251
01:10:11,481 --> 01:10:16,070
I desperately didn't want to be in it
was that I had gotten trapped at that job

1252
01:10:16,071 --> 01:10:16,940
as the talent coordinator.

1253
01:10:16,941 --> 01:10:20,360
I've been doing that job for a long time
and I needed a way out and it was just

1254
01:10:20,361 --> 01:10:23,650
a perfect exit mechanism for me.
And it was,

1255
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,430
that show is like,

1256
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:29,510
I'm so happy that that show happened
because it got me the fuck out of there,

1257
01:10:29,511 --> 01:10:33,240
man. You can get stuck at a desk, man.
Yeah, you can get stuck at a job. But the,

1258
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:37,730
as far as the way his brother movie stuff
goes, so let me, let me just explain it.

1259
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Um, the, the scenes are very similar,

1260
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,350
but Dunkin sort of has a completely
different point to it. But look,

1261
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:47,660
the idea of someone having something fake,
I mean,

1262
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:50,420
how many movies have been when a guy
grabs a girl's hair and it's a wig and

1263
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:54,680
she's bald with like four or five straggly
hairs has been like a bunch of those

1264
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:59,630
sex naked gun. Yeah. It means it's just
one of those, it's like a comedy device.

1265
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:03,510
It's almost like a spit take that
someone's got a fake leg or fake arm.

1266
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,420
But both videos,

1267
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:09,920
the in every way in ones and yours
took it to the end most degree,

1268
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:13,780
which is by the way, what you naturally
do when you make something funny you,

1269
01:11:13,781 --> 01:11:14,614
you always

1270
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,370
in, the more you beat on
it, the funnier it gets.

1271
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,110
And it's essentially the
same joke. What, what? Um,

1272
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:25,260
so where that idea came from
that I did and I have seen,

1273
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:27,720
I'm going to get you Sucka and
I did not remember that scene.

1274
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:30,180
And if I had I never would have done
it. That's a scary thing, right?

1275
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:32,790
When a an ideas in your head and it
comes down, you're like, God damn it.

1276
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:34,710
That was too easy. Well,
no. See, here's the thing,

1277
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:39,810
what that idea came from was from watching
Natasha take her earrings off and I

1278
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:44,220
was watching her take her earrings off
and then I started thinking about like

1279
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,330
how like when you're dating someone
you're like try like when you're in a

1280
01:11:48,331 --> 01:11:52,770
relationship with someone and used or
you start dating somebody and you know,

1281
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,060
part of it is you begin to like
disassemble their personality. You know,

1282
01:11:57,061 --> 01:11:58,410
the more you get to know someone,

1283
01:11:58,411 --> 01:12:00,420
when you've been with
someone for a very long time,

1284
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:03,360
you're in a relationship
or you're married,

1285
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:07,470
you get to know the deepest part of them,
you end up getting to know very,

1286
01:12:07,471 --> 01:12:10,650
very deep parts of them that
are hidden by the hidden,

1287
01:12:10,651 --> 01:12:14,250
by their personalities and things that
they don't ever display in public or

1288
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:17,310
maybe they don't even know about. You
get to know the deepest levels, man,

1289
01:12:17,311 --> 01:12:17,611
when you're,

1290
01:12:17,611 --> 01:12:20,670
when you've been having sex with
someone for a long time and you know,

1291
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:24,060
like the deepest level of a person
and you've been living with someone.

1292
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:28,530
So anyway, I was thinking like, man, it's
so weird how that's what it's all about.

1293
01:12:28,531 --> 01:12:32,310
It's basically just like plucking away
the different pieces of someone until all

1294
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:36,840
they are is, is this primal spark that
you're fucking, so that was the idea.

1295
01:12:36,841 --> 01:12:41,310
That's where it came from. And you
know, you think of when you look at it,

1296
01:12:41,311 --> 01:12:44,850
Natasha taking over earrings.
Yeah. That was pretty high.

1297
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:53,340
But, but so, so, um, so, uh,
anyway, that's it. That's
where the idea came from.

1298
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:57,940
We had to pitch it. We pitched
it to Adam TV. They never,

1299
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:01,610
we've pitched it to Adam TV.
They didn't know about the, uh,

1300
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:04,040
they didn't mention the weigh ins thing.
Uh,

1301
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:08,880
we made the fucking thing
and then immediately a few
people posted links to the

1302
01:13:08,881 --> 01:13:12,690
Wayans brothers and it's like God fucking
damn it as it really, really similar.

1303
01:13:12,691 --> 01:13:17,500
Cause I, I saw the movie but
I barely remember it. I think
that it's, uh, it's the,

1304
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:22,930
it's the exact same, it's the
exact same device, which is, uh,

1305
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,250
disassembling a woman,
but the endings totally different.

1306
01:13:26,251 --> 01:13:28,590
And the point of the
things totally different.

1307
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,390
But to me what was really surprising and
intense about it was that some people

1308
01:13:33,391 --> 01:13:36,270
like really use that against me.

1309
01:13:36,271 --> 01:13:40,390
And like kind of like a really angry
fucking way on Twitter and youtube.

1310
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,160
Have you been at like,
I didn't even know this APP.

1311
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,940
I got some like shitty
messages from people,

1312
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,410
but it's like if I'm going to
steal, right? If I'm going to steal,

1313
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:52,110
I'm going to steal something.
I'm going to steal a sketch.

1314
01:13:52,111 --> 01:13:54,210
I'm going to steal fucking something.
You know what?

1315
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:55,560
I'm not going to steal it from,

1316
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,520
I'm not going to steal it from a
fucking Wayne's movie. You know,

1317
01:13:59,521 --> 01:14:02,370
like it's so obscure. It's probably
easier to hide. I'm going to get you.

1318
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:07,230
Sucka is one of the most popular.
You have to, you have to consider it.

1319
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:12,250
It is possible that your might have it in
your head and that you forgot. Oh well,

1320
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:17,190
sure, of course. But that shit
happens to me, all that man.

1321
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:21,610
But here's the thing. A lot of a
lot of jokes are a form of math.

1322
01:14:21,611 --> 01:14:24,310
It's like an equation. If you take
up some mess, it's an equation.

1323
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:25,810
And if you break that equation down,

1324
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:28,840
it has natural logical
connections in that equation.

1325
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:32,950
And a lot of comedic minds are going to,
if you give them a premise,

1326
01:14:32,951 --> 01:14:35,620
they're going to come up with a
parallel thing. Unfortunately though,

1327
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:39,100
you saw that other one
first. Yes. Factors.

1328
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:43,960
It could have been juiced in my brain,
but I still though there it is like a,

1329
01:14:43,961 --> 01:14:47,260
Wayne's has got a transvestite,
I think it's a transvestite.

1330
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:51,730
She appears hot at first and he takes
her apart and she's not hot as I recall

1331
01:14:51,731 --> 01:14:55,930
from it. He flees and that's
it. You know what I mean?

1332
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,780
It's like it is the same court.
It's not the same thing.

1333
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:03,460
It's like I'm fucking making,
I'm making,

1334
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:07,750
you can't really defend it though
because it is exactly the same joke.

1335
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,130
You know what I'm saying?
Like if someone was,

1336
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:12,870
someone stole the joke from you but then
just twisted it into that and I know he

1337
01:15:12,871 --> 01:15:16,510
didn't steal it. That would be no,
there'd be no, you know there's like,

1338
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:19,810
there's like no excuse. You can't
say, well I did it differently.

1339
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:21,730
Of course you thought of it
under me and I fucking do it.

1340
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:24,160
It's there on the Internet.
There's nothing I do about it.

1341
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,020
And like you're not even Mexican.

1342
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:31,870
My name is nay know man. I did some,
you know what I'm saying though?

1343
01:15:31,871 --> 01:15:36,160
It's like it's like it
parallel thinking is just,

1344
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:40,420
it's unavoidable what it is.
You got to go, Oh shit, I
didn't, whoops. Listen to me.

1345
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:44,230
I'm going to steal your
fucking sketches from now on.

1346
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:46,500
I've made the decision and said
that someone will cut that.

1347
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:51,830
Edit that part.
I don't unleash the hackers Joe.

1348
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:56,230
They're going to cut out that part. You
just fucked up. Really fucked up. Yeah.

1349
01:15:56,231 --> 01:15:58,990
You said something you should never say.
Why?

1350
01:15:58,991 --> 01:16:02,860
Say Rude mean things and pretend that's a,
that's a tired form of common.

1351
01:16:02,861 --> 01:16:06,700
It can be fucking funny dude. The soup.

1352
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:10,480
I did the soup this morning. That
show's funny, dude. I did not know.

1353
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:13,930
They had a bunch of really funny sketches
where they were making fun of the

1354
01:16:13,931 --> 01:16:17,320
chicks are high. We're real
housewives. I was stone cold sober.

1355
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,860
They were making fun of real
housewives of Beverly Hills.

1356
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:24,070
Like one of the crazy chicks is kind of
cracked out and the show this one of the

1357
01:16:24,071 --> 01:16:28,090
writers as how hilarious version
of this check. Like I had to,

1358
01:16:28,091 --> 01:16:29,770
I just guessed by seeing it.

1359
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:32,020
It was hard to hear because
it was really loud in there,

1360
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,240
but I asked her like right away,
I was like,

1361
01:16:34,241 --> 01:16:36,580
that's like girlfriend real house while
she's like, yeah, and I high fived her.

1362
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:40,990
It was like really funny shit man. That
Joel Mchale Dude, he's fucking funny.

1363
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,830
He's got a great delivery and the
writers are really funny, man.

1364
01:16:44,831 --> 01:16:49,570
They had some funny shit on
Kim Kardashians and dude,
I watched this one show,

1365
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:54,340
this access morning show where this guy,
they were goofing on it.

1366
01:16:54,341 --> 01:16:55,510
It's on tonight's episode.

1367
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:58,030
You have to watch this because
you can't believe this is real.

1368
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:02,020
This guy is reading from his blackberry
and he's talking about his help,

1369
01:17:02,021 --> 01:17:05,470
his Mexican help. We gave them a chance
to serve the other day, you know,

1370
01:17:05,471 --> 01:17:09,410
we've never served before and here you
go, here's your shot. Oh my God, dude,

1371
01:17:09,411 --> 01:17:10,280
it's so gross.

1372
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:15,050
And then he reads the guys text in broken
English. Oh me leg shaking all day.

1373
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:20,000
Ah, reads it in like a
Mexican accent. Ah Dude.

1374
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,100
It's like you watch it and go my God,

1375
01:17:22,101 --> 01:17:25,050
someone pull that guy aside and
give him a mushroom trip. Yeah.

1376
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:29,210
Someone give that dude a mushroom trip
and a mirror and sit them in a room and

1377
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:33,350
tell him to think about as the life of
fuck man. Yeah. It's pretty disturbing.

1378
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:36,980
This as it's so clueless.
Again here I'm doing it.

1379
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:40,790
It's just so clueless.
It's like so weird that you don't,

1380
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:43,460
you don't think that people are
gonna find that really gross. Yeah.

1381
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:47,570
It really makes me believe in the idea
that like there's like two species

1382
01:17:47,571 --> 01:17:48,381
happening right now.

1383
01:17:48,381 --> 01:17:52,280
Like humans are differentiating and like
some humans are jumping away from the

1384
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:55,970
uh, what, what most humans are.

1385
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:59,990
I think some people are splitting away
cause like for me to be in a mind state

1386
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,940
where I thought like that or I acted like
that or I read someone's texting and,

1387
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:08,900
and, and like some stereotypical
Mexican accent to humiliate them.

1388
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,050
If I was for me to be new one,
thank you. Assuming I would have to,

1389
01:18:12,051 --> 01:18:15,560
I think I'd have to have a head injury
and it imagine if I started doing that,

1390
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,520
you'd be authentically worried about,

1391
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:21,980
you'd think I'd had a breakdown or this
is how this person lives every day of

1392
01:18:21,981 --> 01:18:25,400
their fucking life. So it's like,
what is that? Who, what kind?

1393
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:29,300
What kind of being is that? Is that,
that's a human, I know it's a human,

1394
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:31,310
but it's not the same kind of human I am.

1395
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:34,010
That's a different kind of human
that's a full of shit human.

1396
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:37,640
That's a full of shit human. That's a,
I don't know what it is. How old is it?

1397
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:39,740
How old is that thing?
How old is that guy?

1398
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:44,330
He's in his thirties so this is a guy in
his thirties he's managed to get to his

1399
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:48,410
thirties and he still like that nothing's
knocked him off the path. He's never,

1400
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:50,870
you know, when you see someone
like that, you know a few things.

1401
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:54,830
You know that he's never
smoked pot probably.

1402
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:58,040
It's probably definitely never taken acid.
Never eaten mushrooms,

1403
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,320
probably has never
heard really good music.

1404
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:03,090
And he's like,
he's like one of those salamanders.

1405
01:19:03,091 --> 01:19:05,950
It never really goes to the transformation
because the water never reaches a

1406
01:19:05,951 --> 01:19:09,900
certain alkaline level. Yeah. That's what
he is, man. You know, you ever hear those?

1407
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:14,050
There's certain, there's certain animals
that never met a morphosis. Yeah,

1408
01:19:14,051 --> 01:19:15,130
the word metamorphosize.

1409
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:18,850
There are certain animals that if the
conditions are incorrect or if there's

1410
01:19:18,851 --> 01:19:20,170
pollution in the environment,

1411
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:23,020
all kinds of different factors
have to be taken into account.

1412
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:24,580
Otherwise they won't make the connection.

1413
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:27,910
He's like a puppy that's eyes didn't open,
her ears didn't open. You know, it's,

1414
01:19:27,911 --> 01:19:29,500
it's eyes stayed fucking shut.

1415
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:30,590
It's a fucking,

1416
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:34,930
it's just silly hippie argument that
everybody needs psychedelics better.

1417
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:38,510
You know, it's not everybody. I'm not
saying everybody needs them, but God damn,

1418
01:19:38,511 --> 01:19:43,010
a lot of people could use them. A lot
of this if they would just study, um,

1419
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,370
and they would just distribute
them through experts.

1420
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:51,020
Imagine what this world would be like if
we had centers where you could go as a

1421
01:19:51,021 --> 01:19:54,920
young man to have a psychedelic
experience and get a broader view of the

1422
01:19:54,921 --> 01:19:55,700
universe.

1423
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:59,150
And someone takes you in and they do
blood work on you and make sure you're

1424
01:19:59,151 --> 01:19:59,990
healthy.

1425
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:04,370
And then they sit you down and you watch
documentaries and you take a class and

1426
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:07,980
when you graduate from the class and the
class is all about pharmacology and the

1427
01:20:07,981 --> 01:20:10,760
way that different things interact
with your body and when the,

1428
01:20:10,761 --> 01:20:12,180
when you're done with this class,

1429
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:15,990
you feel educated and you feel like you
can make your own decision whether or

1430
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:19,200
not you want to try this and if you do
want to try it then they have a ceremony

1431
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,910
and every kid goes in there and you
all with proper meditation techniques,

1432
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,440
proper education as to what the,

1433
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:29,340
the history of the use of these substances
is and the history and the anecdotal

1434
01:20:29,341 --> 01:20:32,820
evidence that it may have been responsible
for the actual birth of religion.

1435
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,860
That this might be what
religion is all about.

1436
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:37,290
It might be psychedelic experience.
If we could have that,

1437
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,110
we can have communities
where we did that well.

1438
01:20:39,111 --> 01:20:44,111
You'd have a big giant football field
fill of people that are doing mushrooms

1439
01:20:44,491 --> 01:20:48,930
and are putting out positive energy
and are there and are balanced healthy

1440
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:53,931
people that want to unite together as a
species and want to embrace each other.

1441
01:20:54,301 --> 01:20:56,550
And help each other and
no one ever get greedy,

1442
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,740
but let's all work together
and do this together.

1443
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:02,050
And you could have a football field
filled with people doing this.

1444
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:06,690
A stadium filled with people doing
this. Yeah. That would fix the world.

1445
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,040
And it sounds ridiculous.

1446
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:09,990
It sounds like you're saying
mushrooms would fix the world.

1447
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:14,070
What would do it better? What? What
could possibly have that effect?

1448
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:16,620
Education education doesn't
necessarily get through.

1449
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:19,770
Your subconscious education doesn't
necessarily get through your programming

1450
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:23,700
side. Education doesn't necessarily get
through anything in your life. That's,

1451
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:27,540
that's really ingrained as a
behavior pattern. It doesn't always,

1452
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:30,810
you can tell people all day like Brian
that cigarettes caused cancer and this

1453
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:35,410
silly, goofy [inaudible] cigarettes
probably more than mushrooms. No, no,

1454
01:21:35,411 --> 01:21:37,290
it wouldn't. Mushrooms would
do it better than anything.

1455
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:41,250
Sex is just in is no enlightenment
involved in that, Brian. It's silly.

1456
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:45,720
The psychedelic experience itself is
important. You need to be humbled.

1457
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,520
It's not just everybody fuck everybody
and feel good about it. Yeah.

1458
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,930
We've talked about this before when
Duncan was design in like, you know,

1459
01:21:51,931 --> 01:21:55,350
that might be good for like five
out of 10 people and the other five,

1460
01:21:55,351 --> 01:21:57,540
they're so terrified they're not
going to ever leave the house again.

1461
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:02,190
This is not necessarily the case because
if it was done correctly through some

1462
01:22:02,191 --> 01:22:06,240
sort of a shamanically center where they
actually evaluated people and, and, and,

1463
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,070
you know,
and taught them and educated them,

1464
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:11,090
he'd probably be able to weed out
the people were fucked up and the Pr,

1465
01:22:11,091 --> 01:22:14,160
I'd be like, dude, reality itself is
a little fucking slippery for you.

1466
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,410
Maybe you should not be doing this.

1467
01:22:16,411 --> 01:22:19,320
Maybe we should look into like
Ritalin for you. Maybe we should,

1468
01:22:19,321 --> 01:22:23,880
you know what I'm saying? I mean,
sure, I'm a lot of people or 100% anti,

1469
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:26,520
uh, antidepressants. They're
like, fuck that dude.

1470
01:22:26,521 --> 01:22:28,740
You're ruining your brain chemistry.
Fuck that dude.

1471
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:29,970
Don't let them change your brain.

1472
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:34,860
I know several people where it's literally
changed their life for the better and

1473
01:22:34,861 --> 01:22:39,510
save their life. Maybe even, I know
several people, so I would never say that.

1474
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:42,620
I would never say that.
Well, man, no know. No

1475
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,770
fucking, I mean the thing is
there's no rules. It's like you.

1476
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:48,770
This is the main rule is it's this is
your incarnation and you get to do what

1477
01:22:48,771 --> 01:22:49,571
you want with it.

1478
01:22:49,571 --> 01:22:54,320
The idea is to like as much
as you can expand and your,

1479
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:58,850
your levels of happiness in your awareness
so that you can feel connected and,

1480
01:22:58,851 --> 01:23:02,720
and good in this existence and
there are a lot of tools to do that.

1481
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:06,910
Some of the tools take a long fucking
time do and I think like when Mckenna was

1482
01:23:06,911 --> 01:23:10,600
talking about mushrooms being the
most obvious tool to transform the,

1483
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:13,600
to create like a huge wide scale
transformation on the planet,

1484
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:17,020
he recognized that there's not a lot
of time. That's what he was thinking.

1485
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:21,400
It's not like we've got a ton of fucking
time to create like meditation temples

1486
01:23:21,401 --> 01:23:24,640
or to spread good information
or to spread some new religion.

1487
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:26,110
There's no time for that shit.

1488
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:31,440
You would if you really wanted to
transform these weird people who worship

1489
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:35,470
invisible,
homophobic child sacrificing God's.

1490
01:23:35,471 --> 01:23:39,070
If you wanted to transform people who
feel comfortable dropping bombs on other

1491
01:23:39,071 --> 01:23:39,730
people,

1492
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:43,930
then the quickest way to do it would be
to give them a substance that allowed

1493
01:23:43,931 --> 01:23:48,460
them to connect to each other end of the
earth and to develop an instantaneous

1494
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:52,030
form of empathy unlike anything else.
And then when they came back to,

1495
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:55,740
it'd be much more difficult to think
about, to perceive what they're,

1496
01:23:55,741 --> 01:23:57,580
they're weird,
invisible God in the same way.

1497
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:01,570
It's almost like we're
moving in a direction in a
terrible direction because we

1498
01:24:01,571 --> 01:24:03,400
don't have the proper ingredients.

1499
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:07,330
So because we don't have
the proper ingredients, we
can't feel what we're doing.

1500
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:12,250
And it's almost like we have a numb arm
probing into the darkness that that numb

1501
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:14,680
arm is scratching the fuck out of reality.

1502
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,580
And we don't know because we just can't
feel it. But if we could just feel it,

1503
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:23,620
if we could add this other ingredient
into the mixture that his life, well then,

1504
01:24:23,621 --> 01:24:24,011
okay,

1505
01:24:24,011 --> 01:24:28,480
now all your pieces are in order and now
you can see and feel what you're doing.

1506
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:32,710
Because the big problem with human
beings when it comes to pollution,

1507
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,520
when it comes to destroying the
atmosphere, when it comes to the idea of,

1508
01:24:36,521 --> 01:24:39,490
you know what, what these nuclear
disasters, we're not feeling it.

1509
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:42,430
We don't feel it.
We don't feel the damage that we're doing.

1510
01:24:42,431 --> 01:24:44,350
We don't feel the garbage
patch in the ocean.

1511
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,480
You don't feel anything when you throw,
when you,

1512
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:49,090
when you take a water bottle and
then you toss it in the garbage can,

1513
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:52,900
you did your job. I'm done. I'm done.
I have no connection with this anymore.

1514
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:56,890
And then we don't feel when it goes into
the ocean and becomes a fucking patch

1515
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:00,730
that's floating, that's as big as
Texas. We don't feel that. And that,

1516
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:04,510
that is a lack of a connection.
That's a missing thing.

1517
01:25:04,511 --> 01:25:07,270
That's an animal that doesn't
have all of its ingredients.

1518
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:09,580
Well, it's fucking blind.
Yeah. That's what it is.

1519
01:25:09,581 --> 01:25:13,530
It's blind and everyone's stumbling
around blind and there their focus is, uh,

1520
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:17,470
on material gain and their
focuses on shit that can,

1521
01:25:18,430 --> 01:25:21,970
if it does make you happy, it's a form.
Very transient, temporary happiness.

1522
01:25:21,971 --> 01:25:23,110
That's you for a lot of people.

1523
01:25:23,111 --> 01:25:27,070
It's usually followed by like depression
and stress. Like people who buy shit,

1524
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:31,720
they can't afford getting the debt to
the banks and become slaves. And so yeah,

1525
01:25:31,721 --> 01:25:32,710
man, people are, um,

1526
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:37,720
people have lost the initial original
connection with the spirit of the earth.

1527
01:25:37,721 --> 01:25:41,230
You know, if you think about like
Iowasca and the people and um,

1528
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:46,380
drinking it in the jungle and community
with the mind of nature and then getting

1529
01:25:47,141 --> 01:25:48,830
direction from the tribe,
from the mind,

1530
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,990
and for people to think
this is hippie bullshit.

1531
01:25:50,991 --> 01:25:53,990
When scientists first came to the
Amazon and discovered Iowasca,

1532
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,570
they tried to call it telepathy dean.

1533
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:00,590
That's what they were going to try to
talk to do. They were going to name it as,

1534
01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:04,580
because the fact that they were
able to have these telepathic

1535
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:08,360
experiences with each other and they
all communicated about having shared

1536
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:12,470
visions and shared hallucinations. So
they were going to call it telepathy in,

1537
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:16,470
but it was already the chemical and it
was already named harming or the, the,

1538
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,310
you know, whatever the, the
substance was. And so they had to,

1539
01:26:19,311 --> 01:26:23,390
they had a stick with the name harming
but we'll, we'll see this substance.

1540
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:28,040
I think uh, for these people has
been a form of spiritual compass.

1541
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:31,400
It points in the right direction. It
reminded sets you straight. It's a,

1542
01:26:31,401 --> 01:26:34,070
it's a like a tuning fork for your soul.

1543
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:37,760
But it's amazing that talking about
this, how did this happen? Talking about,

1544
01:26:37,761 --> 01:26:40,490
this is ridiculous.
Talking about this as absolutely silly.

1545
01:26:40,491 --> 01:26:43,700
I feel nervous when we start talking
about mushrooms can change the world.

1546
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:47,840
Cause I'm like who the fuck you know, w
what does this idiot saying? You know,

1547
01:26:47,841 --> 01:26:51,110
what can I bounce this? Is he
saying he, while you're compelled,

1548
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:54,620
meanwhile you're compelled to say,
listen, I know it sounds stupid.

1549
01:26:54,621 --> 01:26:57,470
I know I'm a goofy look. Fuck I
know him. The fear factor guy,

1550
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:01,160
I know who the hell am I am
barely got through high school.

1551
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:04,070
I went to three years of college
where I halfway paid attention.

1552
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:09,490
But I'm saying that we might
be overlooking one of the
biggest tools that human

1553
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:13,610
beings have ever had for
evolving and developing,

1554
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:17,960
and that might be why the fucking train
is off the tracks and into the woods.

1555
01:27:17,961 --> 01:27:21,830
It might be that the animal isn't
balanced and it might be that the animal

1556
01:27:21,831 --> 01:27:24,620
literally developed eating all this stuff.

1557
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:29,980
The animal might have become consciousness
and aware from being a savage eating

1558
01:27:30,171 --> 01:27:32,480
all this stuff. It might be, you know,

1559
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:36,860
we might have a symbiotic relationship
on this earth with certain plants that

1560
01:27:36,861 --> 01:27:37,820
we've made illegal.

1561
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:42,530
We might need them in order
to be aware of our potential,

1562
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,920
the potential harm that we can do,
the potential good that we can do.

1563
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:49,190
You have positivity.
There's no mind about it.

1564
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:53,780
The value of positivity is so important
when you're on a substance that is where

1565
01:27:53,781 --> 01:27:57,740
all bad trips come from.
All bad trips come from some negativity.

1566
01:27:57,741 --> 01:28:00,020
Whether it's a paranoia,
whether it's a fear,

1567
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:03,590
whether it's a bad memory that you
have that you're trying to avoid,

1568
01:28:03,591 --> 01:28:05,570
shitty behavior that haunts you,

1569
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:08,930
that you can't correct whatever the
fuck it is that triggers the bad trip.

1570
01:28:08,931 --> 01:28:11,450
It's always a negative
thing. Well, what what it is,

1571
01:28:11,451 --> 01:28:14,600
is it's what's happening is that when
you're, when you're taking a psychedelic,

1572
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:19,340
you're being given a glimpse at yourself
from a distance that maybe you can't

1573
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:22,700
have an obtained and you, like
meditation will give you that distance.

1574
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,530
It gives you a form of
intense mindfulness.

1575
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,890
And so all of a sudden
you're able to see, um, the,

1576
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,850
I think the root of whatever
pattern your life is becoming.

1577
01:28:31,851 --> 01:28:32,990
The root as a feeling.

1578
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:35,990
And that feeling for a lot of
people can be a negative feeling.

1579
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:38,830
And so that's when people say, you know,
I don't like smoking pot, man, cause I,

1580
01:28:39,050 --> 01:28:41,540
it makes me get introspective.
I get paranoid and nervous.

1581
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:45,740
It's like no pot is not
making you paranoid.

1582
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:50,870
Pot is showing you the paranoia that
exists deep within you that's causing you

1583
01:28:50,871 --> 01:28:52,880
to act fucking weird and causing your,

1584
01:28:52,881 --> 01:28:55,720
our relationships to be a little
more adult than they need to be.

1585
01:28:55,721 --> 01:28:59,510
And causing your actions to be a little
muted because you're afraid of the

1586
01:28:59,511 --> 01:29:02,070
reaction that people are going
to have. Do you? Cause you're a,

1587
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,260
you're still stuck in survival.

1588
01:29:04,261 --> 01:29:08,070
You want to survive so bad that you're
scared and you've covered that up with

1589
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:08,641
all the different,

1590
01:29:08,641 --> 01:29:11,700
whatever clothes you've decided you're
going to wear in this incarnation and

1591
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:15,030
your tattoos or whatever you've learned.
But deep within that,

1592
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:17,610
behind all that for a lot of people is uh,

1593
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:22,530
something that you could easily turn
negative energy. But I think it's, uh,

1594
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:26,490
it's fear, it's fear and that
and psychedelic show you that.

1595
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:31,020
And so the way to trip and he centers
that you're talking about and if they're

1596
01:29:31,021 --> 01:29:35,160
really, the centers were there, then
when someone started experiencing, uh,

1597
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:40,170
a difficult trip, then these people would,
instead of getting them away from that,

1598
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:44,460
they in the best way possible, try to turn
the person to like, what is that fear?

1599
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,690
Is that fear real?

1600
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:50,400
Cause the joy of a psychedelic is
when you have the balls to go into the

1601
01:29:50,401 --> 01:29:54,780
darkness and all of a sudden you realize
that darkness was a complete illusion.

1602
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:59,280
All the darkness and negativity and
Spooky Shit and guilt and fear and crappy

1603
01:29:59,281 --> 01:30:02,460
thought was inside you and all the bad
things you thought you've done and all

1604
01:30:02,461 --> 01:30:06,600
the things that you feel terrible about.
Secretly you realize that's nothing.

1605
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:09,150
It's an illusion.
The universe loves you.

1606
01:30:09,151 --> 01:30:11,640
You're completely embraced
by the entire universe.

1607
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:15,060
You're an incremental part of the
functioning of the cosmos and you're an

1608
01:30:15,061 --> 01:30:19,200
incredible, wonderful, perfect fucking
thing. And when you get a glimpse of that,

1609
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,570
it's the greatest feeling
ever because you're healed.

1610
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:23,430
Cause that's what true healing is,
man.

1611
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:27,030
True healing is realizing you were never
sick in the first place. True healings.

1612
01:30:27,031 --> 01:30:29,550
Realizing you were just, you
just had some fucking, uh, yeah,

1613
01:30:29,551 --> 01:30:33,990
a little bit of dust on the windshield,
man. I think you brush it off, you know,

1614
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:37,590
that's, uh, and that's, and that's what
psychedelics do for you. And you know,

1615
01:30:37,591 --> 01:30:39,780
what else does that for you?
Really good therapy,

1616
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:43,230
but really good therapy costs a lot of
money and it takes a long fucking time.

1617
01:30:43,231 --> 01:30:46,200
You have to be open to it,
open to change and smart.

1618
01:30:46,201 --> 01:30:48,750
And you have to have the ability
to recognize your own faults.

1619
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:52,980
Some people just have this weird shield
between them and reality where they've

1620
01:30:52,981 --> 01:30:56,400
become successful because they never admit
guilt and they just press forward and

1621
01:30:56,401 --> 01:30:59,730
they rationalize every single thing
they do when just press forward.

1622
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:03,720
And that becomes a mindset just as much
as you know what we're talking about.

1623
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:07,350
Yeah. That becomes just
how work is done, you know?

1624
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,110
And that's how military his work,
that's the only way they work.

1625
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:13,770
You have to fall into a mindset.
Yeah. Well, yeah, that's how, I mean,

1626
01:31:13,771 --> 01:31:15,210
that's the thing. We've, we're all,

1627
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:18,930
we've all fallen into a mindset and a
lot of the fundamentalist Christians,

1628
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:21,270
they've fallen into these
rituals and patterns,

1629
01:31:21,271 --> 01:31:23,500
but they don't have a
real connection anymore.

1630
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,420
So they're faking it or they're actually
just like taking cues from like really

1631
01:31:27,421 --> 01:31:28,860
charismatic lunatics.

1632
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:33,870
Wouldn't it be awesome if the military
really was our bravest and boldest who

1633
01:31:33,931 --> 01:31:37,040
wanted to protect us
and who are led by the,

1634
01:31:37,041 --> 01:31:41,040
the most moral and intelligent
people on the planet.

1635
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,420
These really, truly were heroes.
And in case some shit goes down,

1636
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,910
they're never puppets.
They're only heroes.

1637
01:31:47,911 --> 01:31:50,910
There's no doubt whatsoever that they're
only doing the right thing when that'd

1638
01:31:50,911 --> 01:31:54,110
be beautiful. Yeah. They'd
be like celebrities when
that'd be beautiful. You know,

1639
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:58,440
they should be, they re most of them
really want to be heroes. You know,

1640
01:31:58,441 --> 01:32:00,340
most of the really want to protect.

1641
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:04,570
It's the people that are putting
them there was, are the problems.

1642
01:32:04,571 --> 01:32:06,790
The people that are pointing you in
that goes, those are the bad guys.

1643
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:10,900
Go get them. I'll be over here with a
pencil to write down how many a kill.

1644
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:12,430
And if you do a good job,

1645
01:32:12,431 --> 01:32:17,380
I give you a shiny piece of metal and I
stick it to your fucking chest. Ah, yeah.

1646
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:22,320
It's so fucking sad, man. It's so
sad and disturbing and it's like,

1647
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,560
it's, it's so easy to get
caught up in, in that, you know,

1648
01:32:25,561 --> 01:32:29,510
it's so easy to get caught up
in the macro, uh, of, of the,

1649
01:32:29,511 --> 01:32:32,280
of the darkness that's in the world.
But man,

1650
01:32:32,281 --> 01:32:36,210
I think that the trick is to like only
spend a little time on that and spend

1651
01:32:36,211 --> 01:32:41,100
more time fucking working on a real
basic things in your life that you can do

1652
01:32:41,101 --> 01:32:44,720
right now to like, um, to make
things a little better. Like tickets.

1653
01:32:44,730 --> 01:32:48,720
A lot of people will focus on Kim
trails when they need to be focusing on

1654
01:32:48,721 --> 01:32:49,860
stopping smoking.

1655
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:53,940
Like I had a person
describe Kim trails to me,

1656
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,380
smoking a fucking Marlboro
light talking about, man,

1657
01:32:58,381 --> 01:33:03,030
they're fucking drop in this shit on us.
That's sickening. US making us stupid.

1658
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:09,650
It's like, dude, you know, you're
inhaling, you're inhaling cancerous smoke,

1659
01:33:09,810 --> 01:33:12,870
uh, created by fucking
corporation that's making money.

1660
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:17,160
It's making money off of healing. Healing
cares about some fucking Kim trails,

1661
01:33:17,161 --> 01:33:20,310
brother, you got to
stop smoking. You like,

1662
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:24,370
that's probably way worse it many more
people are dying from cigarette smoke.

1663
01:33:24,371 --> 01:33:27,450
They're dying from chem trails. Yeah,
that's so silly. So those are the steps.

1664
01:33:27,451 --> 01:33:29,520
But people,
it's a really simple thing to do.

1665
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:31,980
You get caught up in the macro
instead of being like, you know what?

1666
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:34,650
Here's the thing you can try instead
of worrying about Kim trails,

1667
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:39,690
why don't you fucking get a good recipe
book of like raw recipe book trading raw

1668
01:33:39,691 --> 01:33:42,930
for a few days and see if that makes you
feel better. Cut Out some fucking, uh,

1669
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:47,100
cut out eating processed food for a few
days, not forever, just for a few days.

1670
01:33:47,101 --> 01:33:48,030
And the issue is

1671
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:51,770
a lot of them are really misinformed
and they really do believe that there's

1672
01:33:51,771 --> 01:33:53,660
this constant aerial bombardment.

1673
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:56,930
But one of the reasons why they believe
it is because they have done some

1674
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:59,750
chemical spraying on people and
they've done it against people's will.

1675
01:33:59,751 --> 01:34:01,700
It's a fact. Sure. You
know, it's not, it's,

1676
01:34:01,701 --> 01:34:03,140
I don't believe it's happening every day.

1677
01:34:03,141 --> 01:34:06,030
I think a lot of what people
are seeing is called con trails.

1678
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:09,740
It's a natural thing that happens when
jet engines encounter moisture in the

1679
01:34:09,741 --> 01:34:11,810
atmosphere.
It was explained to me by a pilot.

1680
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:12,730
Yeah.

1681
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:17,730
But let's go fight the chem trail pilots
when we've got a clear head because we

1682
01:34:17,901 --> 01:34:19,930
haven't been eating shitty food and,
uh,

1683
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:23,210
and when we feel like fit
because we've been exercising,

1684
01:34:23,211 --> 01:34:24,830
that's when we can start waging the real,
yeah.

1685
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:26,120
Oh wait,
my point is,

1686
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:29,870
my Pi is the reason why they believe
that there's chem trails is because there

1687
01:34:29,871 --> 01:34:33,530
have been chem trails. They're really
happened. The government has experimented.

1688
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,290
I have no doubt. I don't
think they're doing it all
the time, but it has happened.

1689
01:34:36,291 --> 01:34:39,950
Sure. There's not only hasn't had,
hasn't happened, but in certain states,

1690
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:44,930
I'm like, God was at Georgia.
I forget what state it is.

1691
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:47,570
Um, anyway, the point is that it's,

1692
01:34:47,630 --> 01:34:51,500
it's literally like written into
insurance laws. Like there's,

1693
01:34:51,501 --> 01:34:55,830
there's things about, you
know, like chemicals spraying
that like a, you know, you,

1694
01:34:55,831 --> 01:35:00,500
you insure against, I believe I'm, I'm,
you know, I'm, I'm speaking out of, uh,

1695
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,410
out of hand right here because I
don't know the exact details of it.

1696
01:35:03,411 --> 01:35:06,320
It seems a little blurry in my mind
right now while I'm trying to pull it up.

1697
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:09,170
But I remember whatever it was,
this little piece of legislation,

1698
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:12,410
whether it was a all you know, something
about insurance or not, whatever it was,

1699
01:35:12,411 --> 01:35:13,010
it was written down.

1700
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:18,010
It was essentially saying that there
will be weather controlled experiments

1701
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:22,340
there. They will do something
to alter the weather.

1702
01:35:22,341 --> 01:35:27,170
And we know that in Abu Dhabi they
made it rain 50 times last year.

1703
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:27,500
Wow.

1704
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:32,410
So they essentially made it rain
once a week with a plane flying over.

1705
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:34,790
I think it's aluminum oxide
and bury him or something.

1706
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:37,250
I forget what it is that they,
they spray into the air,

1707
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:39,260
but they spray it and somehow or another,

1708
01:35:39,261 --> 01:35:41,330
it makes these clouds form and it makes,

1709
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:45,860
it makes rainfall in the desert in
Abu Dhabi. Man, it's amazing. I mean,

1710
01:35:45,861 --> 01:35:46,580
it's incredible.

1711
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:49,440
So if we know that they're doing that
well they gave people so he didn't lose

1712
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,260
learn how to do it over there is my point.

1713
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,690
They probably practiced some shit
here and they, they, you know,

1714
01:35:53,691 --> 01:35:57,890
and they probably been doing it here in,
in small doses for a long time, you know.

1715
01:35:58,250 --> 01:35:58,970
Well.
Yeah,

1716
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:03,500
I mean like I eat pretty much anything
that I've found out about the government

1717
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:07,100
doing. I wouldn't be that surprised,
like know no matter you say syphilis,

1718
01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:11,280
you're talking about the Tuskegee.
Yeah, they fucking blasted Vicki.

1719
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:14,950
What is the exact details of that? They
expected. A bunch of books asked me.

1720
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:18,560
I think what I was was they told some
that they're being treated and they

1721
01:36:18,561 --> 01:36:20,240
weren't being treated with any medication.

1722
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:23,390
They lied to them to see the
degenerative effects of the disease.

1723
01:36:23,490 --> 01:36:26,200
Dude, on this century of the
self thing there, there's uh,

1724
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:30,380
there were interviewing the fucking main
psychologists for the CIA during the

1725
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:34,220
60s and the 70s and he's just talking
about all the shit they did with LSD

1726
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:37,040
experiments where they like
white people's paths away.

1727
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:40,880
They would blast you on as it and give
you a lecture shock therapy to try to

1728
01:36:40,881 --> 01:36:42,740
fucking or raise your personality.

1729
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:46,820
Like they've done all kinds of crazy shit
and they probably are continuing to do

1730
01:36:46,821 --> 01:36:47,654
crazy shit.

1731
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:50,930
And there was a really good chance that
when you're driving through any public

1732
01:36:50,931 --> 01:36:51,291
space,

1733
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:55,130
you're being bombarded with subliminal
messages and all the billboards that

1734
01:36:55,131 --> 01:36:57,480
you're seeing that are turning
you into a mat, into a,

1735
01:36:57,830 --> 01:37:02,400
into a fucking rabid consumer that
only wants to eat and drink and a,

1736
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:05,240
it doesn't ever want to think about
anything more than getting a raise and

1737
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:07,940
getting drunk at night. And it may
be that this is all intentional,

1738
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:10,910
but what I'm saying is if you
worry about that too much,

1739
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,120
then you're not going to do your dishes
and you're going to have roaches in your

1740
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:17,270
fucking apartment and then you're going
to start feeling depressed and then you

1741
01:37:17,271 --> 01:37:20,220
get really caught deep in the trap to,

1742
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:23,570
to the first thing you have to
do is like come to your senses.

1743
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:24,561
That's the first thing.

1744
01:37:24,561 --> 01:37:29,561
And the easiest way to come to your
senses is to like stop taking the fucking

1745
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:33,470
stop putting the pills in your mouth. You
know, like movies about mental asylums.

1746
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:37,790
Inevitably the hero will always start
putting the pillows under his bed and have

1747
01:37:37,791 --> 01:37:39,470
that little line of pills under his bed.

1748
01:37:39,471 --> 01:37:42,470
And all of a sudden he's come to his
senses again and he can plan his escape.

1749
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:46,310
But until you fucking stop taking the
pills, you can't plan your escape.

1750
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:49,520
So it's like, okay, yeah,
maybe there's some fucked up
shit happening in the world,

1751
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:51,470
but you got to stop smoking.

1752
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:54,020
Maybe there's some fucked up
shit happening in the world,

1753
01:37:54,021 --> 01:37:56,040
but you should run a few times

1754
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,260
a week. Maybe there's fucked
up shit happening in the world,

1755
01:37:58,261 --> 01:38:00,510
but you need to take a shower,
brush your teeth,

1756
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:03,990
floss good so that you're
get clean and healthy.

1757
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:05,850
And then when you have
more of a clear head,

1758
01:38:05,851 --> 01:38:09,660
then you can start making real moves and
really analyzing what may be happening.

1759
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:13,050
But until then you're all foggy and
fucked up. When you see Michael Moore,

1760
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:16,670
don't you want to go, dude? Yeah,
forget about the government. Yes,

1761
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:17,520
take care of yourself.

1762
01:38:17,521 --> 01:38:21,390
So you got to deal with a fucking
tear at tyranny and yourself.

1763
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:25,320
You've got to deal with the fucking
demonic senators and congressmen inside of

1764
01:38:25,321 --> 01:38:28,440
you that keeps telling you to eat a
fucking cheeseburger and a bag of Doritos

1765
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:29,370
before you go to bed.

1766
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:34,500
Stop those fucking people first veto
there bills that are coming from inside

1767
01:38:34,501 --> 01:38:36,770
your heart. Is that a self
hate thing? Is that an,

1768
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:38,670
I don't care about my own safety thing.

1769
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:43,050
It's just like I'm obsessed with my goals.
I'm obsessed with my interest.

1770
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:45,810
I don't care about my own personal safety
to the point where I'm just going to

1771
01:38:45,811 --> 01:38:50,550
over feed myself. Yeah,
well rational thinking, just
completely given to impulse.

1772
01:38:50,610 --> 01:38:53,800
It's a fuck. What did, I mean? I think
what it is is it's like a, a row.

1773
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:54,960
It's a literal Rut.

1774
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:58,830
It's like you've been going in this
circle for so long that you can't get out.

1775
01:38:58,831 --> 01:39:00,930
You're like a truck.
His wheels are stuck in the mud.

1776
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:03,840
So you just stuck in this endless pattern.
That's what we do.

1777
01:39:03,841 --> 01:39:07,320
Humans get stuck in patterns, you know?
And so the idea is to get knocked.

1778
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,930
You gotta knock yourself
out of that pattern somehow.

1779
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:12,570
And the quickest way to do
that is with a psychedelic.

1780
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:16,020
If you don't want to take a
psychedelic than just seriously start.

1781
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:20,450
I know that sounds super hippy.
Start fucking juicing. Drink healthy,

1782
01:39:20,451 --> 01:39:24,180
eat healthy, just eat healthy. I don't
care why you eat, eat fucking healthy,

1783
01:39:24,181 --> 01:39:29,100
fighting mixed juice. Three days.
Vitamix. Vitamix is way better.

1784
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:32,390
Yeah. I just, I got this fucking a,

1785
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:34,620
it's the best way to force yourself
to eat a ton of vegetables.

1786
01:39:34,621 --> 01:39:39,090
Do you just drink it? You know, you
think about like how much I eat.

1787
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:43,800
I have a one big cucumber,
like six stalks of celery,

1788
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:48,950
five big giant leaps of Kale and a big
chunk of ginger and a pair and I just

1789
01:39:49,981 --> 01:39:53,370
blast all that shit. There's no way I'm
going to sit and eat all that ginger.

1790
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:58,410
I love Ginger and as you can
throw in there, that's good man.

1791
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:01,290
Fucking Jalapeno.
It's so fucking good.

1792
01:40:01,291 --> 01:40:05,490
I've had marked drop and Jalapenos in the
blender with almost everything I made.

1793
01:40:05,491 --> 01:40:09,120
I made a fucking chocolate Mousse the
other day and my calendar and I threw a

1794
01:40:09,121 --> 01:40:13,460
Jalapeno in there. Delicious.
Kind of like spicy chocolate. Why?

1795
01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:17,820
You can put in fucking anything. You can
put it in like you can put anyway dude,

1796
01:40:17,821 --> 01:40:22,560
you need to show in the food. You can
do anything with the Jalapeno Jalapeno,

1797
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:26,300
my asshole today. Chop. What does
a slap chop. You could be as flat

1798
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:32,670
and the slap chop. I gladly do it.
You'd be like Dunkin, the Jalapeno guy.

1799
01:40:32,671 --> 01:40:33,391
You could have a book.

1800
01:40:33,391 --> 01:40:38,391
I'm dunking Jalapeno guy
showing you [inaudible] please.

1801
01:40:40,291 --> 01:40:41,100
Crazy.

1802
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:45,510
I put it in my baby out the Jalapenos
inside toothpaste kills bacteria that he's

1803
01:40:45,511 --> 01:40:49,680
enlisted marine can't get to and this
is like an ancient way that the Mayans

1804
01:40:49,681 --> 01:40:54,110
used to clean their teeth. They cheat
on Habanero peppers. I love it. I love

1805
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,740
imagine if that's true. If it's like
you'd kills all the poison. Why Jalapeno?

1806
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,960
Well that's isn't that one of the things
that Japanese people like to use Wasabi

1807
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:05,870
with Sushi because was Sabi
apparently has an effect on any,

1808
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:09,170
any sort of bacteria that you might,
yeah, I mean it's fucking blowtorch.

1809
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:13,360
Hardcore snort Wasabi. Good luck. I
always fuck that up to you man. I always

1810
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:18,520
like a giant bite it to love it.
I love Wasabi.

1811
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:23,380
I ate up a whole fucking jar
of Habanero salsa last night.

1812
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:27,850
I had chips in this big jar of like
from the moment I ate the first bite,

1813
01:41:27,851 --> 01:41:31,840
I was like, God damn, that shit is
hot. I couldn't stop. I was sweating.

1814
01:41:31,841 --> 01:41:35,790
You never get fire shits or
anything. Oh yeah, go. All right.

1815
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:38,470
I know I'm going to kill myself.
Take it to, I'd do a fucking,

1816
01:41:38,471 --> 01:41:39,670
I get in a horse stance.

1817
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,500
Why don't you just think of that as a
member of the movie come through when the

1818
01:41:44,501 --> 01:41:48,160
flaming pots in front of them and one
sign as a dragon and the other side is a

1819
01:41:48,161 --> 01:41:50,690
tiger and he picks up
the pot with his form.

1820
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:56,620
I don't think it's a coincidence that
I have a tiger on one arm and a fucking

1821
01:41:56,621 --> 01:42:01,300
dragon on the other and I was a
fan of the Kung Fu show. Okay,

1822
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:06,700
well, well how about that?
I'm going to get you sucker.

1823
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,300
I stole that. I stole that
without even thinking about it.

1824
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:16,780
I'm just saying, man, I'm admitted. I
stole my toe like my tattoos from Kung Fu,

1825
01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:21,280
but I think that's what the
motivation was. Oh Hey, confidence.

1826
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:25,300
Motivation.
You hit Kong theory.

1827
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:28,630
There's some Kung Fu guys mad at me.

1828
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:34,300
He said that the guard is actually called
baby monkey. It's called baby monkey.

1829
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:38,340
It's hilarious. It's really fun. When do
you find that? Because I that Eddie Eddie,

1830
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:42,490
we'll send it to me. Eddie Bravo sent
it to me. It's a fucking hilarious.

1831
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:45,610
You want to play it all right play.
I'll tell you what, what part it,

1832
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:49,900
cause I tweeted it. What part? The guy
starts talking shit about me but it's,

1833
01:42:49,901 --> 01:42:52,960
he's one of those dudes and
this is, this is truth. Listen,

1834
01:42:53,230 --> 01:42:56,980
there's a lot of people that got upset
at me because I said things about Kung Fu

1835
01:42:57,190 --> 01:42:58,001
and there's a lot of people,

1836
01:42:58,001 --> 01:43:01,720
cause I said come food is kind of bullshit
and a lot of it is just like a bunch

1837
01:43:01,721 --> 01:43:05,020
of people practicing things. Like if I
come at you like this, what would happen?

1838
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:08,480
I would move to the side and it would
attack this way. It is, it's, it's,

1839
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,650
it's like a one step,
you know,

1840
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:14,620
in taekwondo we still have the things
called one steps. And what it is is,

1841
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:15,160
you know,

1842
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,950
you would throw a kick and the other
guy would counter and when it was his to

1843
01:43:17,951 --> 01:43:22,150
him imprint into your mind what to
do once you start sparring and then

1844
01:43:22,151 --> 01:43:24,610
eventually you start sparring.
But when you start sparring,

1845
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:26,950
that's when techniques
really get weeded out.

1846
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:30,880
And that's when you understand what is
the most effective use of energy and

1847
01:43:30,881 --> 01:43:35,620
force, what techniques work the best, what
techniques are really truly applicable,

1848
01:43:35,621 --> 01:43:38,330
and what techniques are really kind
of frivolous and a waste of time.

1849
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:40,960
There's better alternatives will come.
Food never did that.

1850
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:42,940
They didn't have all the sparring,
they didn't,

1851
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:46,600
he didn't know how Kung Fu didn't like
go and enter into an ultimate fighting

1852
01:43:46,601 --> 01:43:49,750
championship where it was public and
everybody figured it out and it was spread

1853
01:43:49,751 --> 01:43:50,531
out through the Internet.

1854
01:43:50,531 --> 01:43:53,870
So there's the debate amongst all the
minds of different martial artists,

1855
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:55,760
whether they're kickboxers are wrestlers.

1856
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:59,210
There is a genuine consensus when
it comes to mixed martial arts.

1857
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:02,690
And that genuine consensus is,
here's the school there,

1858
01:44:02,691 --> 01:44:06,170
here's the group of effective techniques.
This is what actually works. Yes,

1859
01:44:06,171 --> 01:44:09,620
you can. We'll kick someone in the face.
Absolutely. It's difficult to pull off,

1860
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:13,790
but you can, we'll kick some of the face.
Can you monkey fist them on the nose?

1861
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,580
You can,
but that's not the best way to do it.

1862
01:44:16,581 --> 01:44:20,570
The best way to do is the Jab and
then one two jab, right? Monkey fist.

1863
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,060
Apparently there isn't a monkey first.
Apparently I made it up.

1864
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:25,550
He apparently it's leopard fist.

1865
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:28,990
The guy told me liquid fish is
no monkeyfy sure right days,

1866
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,950
no monkey face lab fs. But that's his
style of Kung Fu. Because this dude,

1867
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:35,690
this dudes were also, we're
angry at me. We're talking, man,

1868
01:44:35,691 --> 01:44:39,080
I hit you in the face with a monkey
paw. You're going to be upset. You know,

1869
01:44:39,081 --> 01:44:42,380
so I'm like, you know, so there's a monkey
park then it must be, it must be real.

1870
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:45,140
So he in his and his style
of martial arts, it's real.

1871
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:48,260
But in this one Kung Fu guy,
it's a leopard Paul.

1872
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:50,900
And that's the only technique that works.
I'm not saying that you,

1873
01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:53,900
you shit won't work and it's definitely
better than knowing nothing at all.

1874
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:57,110
But as far as he is the
best thing to practice, no,

1875
01:44:57,260 --> 01:44:59,240
there might be some good benefit to it,

1876
01:44:59,270 --> 01:45:02,300
but if you want to look at the real
true evolution of martial arts, what it,

1877
01:45:02,301 --> 01:45:05,570
what is martial arts with
a martial art is, is uh,

1878
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:10,740
an art where you figure out what is the
best way to attack and disable a trained

1879
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:15,320
killer.
That's what you want to be good at.

1880
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,600
You want to be good at
beating trained killers.

1881
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:19,880
You don't want to be good at beating
people don't know what they're doing

1882
01:45:19,881 --> 01:45:23,180
because that's what a lot of people are
doing. A lot of martial arts are, it's,

1883
01:45:23,181 --> 01:45:25,940
it's your drug developing techniques.
They really will never work.

1884
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:29,690
If you're fighting against Anderson Silva,
you're going to get them off.

1885
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:30,740
There is no best one.

1886
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:33,650
The best one is all the effective
techniques of all the martial arts.

1887
01:45:33,651 --> 01:45:38,651
It's tech take downs from wrestling and
judo kicking from karate and Moy Tai Jiu

1888
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:41,210
Jitsu, submissions from
judo and Jujitsu. You know,

1889
01:45:41,211 --> 01:45:45,380
there's all these different things.
Leg locks from Samba, all of these,

1890
01:45:45,390 --> 01:45:49,070
and you don't have to have, there's
no correct combination of what to use.

1891
01:45:49,071 --> 01:45:51,080
Some guys only use a
few of the components,

1892
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:54,980
but they have a very unusual physicality
or they're very good at one of these

1893
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:57,470
aspects of the point where,
especially like a stand up fighter,

1894
01:45:57,471 --> 01:45:58,610
like a guy like Anderson Silva,

1895
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:01,790
that's his number one specialty
stand up and he's so good at it.

1896
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:02,990
Every fight start standing up.

1897
01:46:02,991 --> 01:46:05,210
So he has an advantage at
the beginning of every fight.

1898
01:46:05,211 --> 01:46:08,120
He has an advantage and if
you can get to that spot,

1899
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:09,770
you don't have to be
like the best wrestler.

1900
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:11,720
Like Anderson's not taking people down.
I mean,

1901
01:46:11,721 --> 01:46:13,250
I'm sure he could if you wanted to,

1902
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:16,580
but you very rarely see him taking
people down. He just blasts everybody,

1903
01:46:16,910 --> 01:46:20,600
you know? So if you can get really good
at certain aspects of it, you know,

1904
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:24,020
there is no exact formula what to do.
But as far as techniques,

1905
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:28,100
there's a general consensus of techniques
that work. You know the basic kicks,

1906
01:46:28,101 --> 01:46:31,190
front kicks and round kicks. There's
the crazy ones. Act Kicks, wheel kicks,

1907
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:33,920
there's all this stuff works,
but you know what doesn't work?

1908
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:37,790
What doesn't work is like crane
techniques. When you're standing.

1909
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:40,040
I mean it will work,
but it's better to box.

1910
01:46:40,041 --> 01:46:42,500
It's better to curl your knuckles
up and blast them in the face.

1911
01:46:42,501 --> 01:46:47,240
It's better to kick them, you know,
and the kick them correctly the best.

1912
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:49,230
You got to go to a certain,
I'll tell you when to go.

1913
01:46:49,231 --> 01:46:51,240
I think it's two minutes and four seconds.

1914
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:57,160
Joe Rogan. Yeah, well MMA countable you.

1915
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:01,870
Monkey non-fan, Marco Locke,
nonsense martial arts.

1916
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,290
There's no monkey

1917
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:13,050
monkey,
but I understand Joel type is saying,

1918
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:16,780
oh come cool. If not,
then you're fucked man.

1919
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:24,840
The funny thing is Joe used the word
monkey to lamb and marketing come home.

1920
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:27,640
He's really don't know.

1921
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:32,380
No one used the monkey
technique more than the MMA.

1922
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:35,170
This lake where epic,

1923
01:47:37,090 --> 01:47:40,150
this would call baby monkey

1924
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:44,270
showing the garden done.

1925
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:49,320
You will feed baby monkey whack,
whack,

1926
01:47:49,570 --> 01:47:54,570
whack a leg while my nine month
waistline and up back be 5% of the time.

1927
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:03,040
And that is exactly what MMA,
you think the baby monkeys,

1928
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:06,190
65% of the time inside that cage.

1929
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:09,730
Now who is the monkey here?

1930
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:13,260
I have no problem of the work monkey.

1931
01:48:13,261 --> 01:48:18,010
You as low as eight is
a good cat like mine.

1932
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:21,080
Monkeys painting Ahmad monthly spending on

1933
01:48:25,810 --> 01:48:28,470
MMA fighter are strong and tough,

1934
01:48:30,130 --> 01:48:35,130
but don't be confused just because they
do full contact then they might be real

1935
01:48:38,591 --> 01:48:39,470
martial artist.

1936
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:45,550
Do you think gangster do full contact
fighting and they must be all wheel

1937
01:48:47,171 --> 01:48:51,530
martial artist? Absolutely
not. Okay. Hold on. I simply,

1938
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:53,080
teenage street fighter.

1939
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:55,360
I think we might be getting trolled.

1940
01:48:56,020 --> 01:48:59,980
That feels like a troll as I'm watching
this under the influence of the sacred

1941
01:48:59,981 --> 01:49:03,030
plant might disguise obviously
reading off of something. Yeah,

1942
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:05,530
he's reading off to the side. I'm
listening to it. I'm like this guy.

1943
01:49:05,531 --> 01:49:09,670
It doesn't sound like it makes sense. And
then when he hits that Armbar God dude,

1944
01:49:09,671 --> 01:49:12,430
he does that so slow.
That's a guy who's not a grappler at all.

1945
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:14,550
He was on a grappler.
That guy doesn't know what he's doing.

1946
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:19,180
One of the things was called monkey
baby monkey. Big Monkey. Awesome.

1947
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:23,170
Well that might be a technique
we very well might be,

1948
01:49:23,171 --> 01:49:26,880
but it also might be a troll
was totally like a trail.

1949
01:49:27,090 --> 01:49:30,590
That's why he mentioned my name cause
he knows I'm stupid and I bite. Yeah,

1950
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:34,320
I just went right after it and he wanted,
he got me the fuck you and Sam trip,

1951
01:49:34,321 --> 01:49:37,590
baby monkey.
Good work man.

1952
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:42,680
I could get that for a licensed
play. Baby Monkey, big monkey.

1953
01:49:42,681 --> 01:49:46,720
A lap at Winco with a wound with
this technique is called baby monkey.

1954
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:48,130
It's brilliant.
Whoever

1955
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:51,940
did that. Congratulations. You did a good
job. Well done. If it is real, Sarah,

1956
01:49:51,941 --> 01:49:52,930
please come to 10th planet,

1957
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:57,890
10th Planet Jiu Jitsu in Los Angeles
and I love to try out your baby monkey.

1958
01:49:57,891 --> 01:50:00,240
See if I could pass your baby monkey.
I went to kiss your baby monkeys.

1959
01:50:00,241 --> 01:50:03,130
I Bet I can pass your baby monkey. I'm
just saying right now. I mean I'm no,

1960
01:50:03,131 --> 01:50:04,900
I'm no killer.
I'm know Marcella Garcia,

1961
01:50:04,901 --> 01:50:08,020
but I watched your role and I'm pretty
sure I could pass your baby monkey.

1962
01:50:08,230 --> 01:50:09,100
That's all I'm saying.

1963
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:12,160
Challenge your baby monkey on me and
then I'm going to get side control.

1964
01:50:12,161 --> 01:50:14,020
I Bet I'm going to get side
control. Yeah. And this is hot.

1965
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:16,570
I don't give a fuck bro.
I don't give a fuck dude.

1966
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:19,570
I'm going to want to try that
wack ass baby monkey. I mean,

1967
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:21,760
I'll show him what's up.
10 plants, Jujitsu Bitch.

1968
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:25,670
And you know the other thing that
music, like if there in that video, Joe,

1969
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:29,650
here's my thing, it's funny, but if he's,
if he's serious. Yeah. If he's serious,

1970
01:50:29,651 --> 01:50:33,070
it's offensive to me because you know,
if he's serious, I don't think yes,

1971
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:33,851
but if he is serious,

1972
01:50:33,851 --> 01:50:35,980
it's offensive to all martial arts because
that guy doesn't know what he's doing.

1973
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:38,250
The way he's hitting that arm
bar. I'm like, Jesus Christ.

1974
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:40,410
Or now he's hitting an armbar though.

1975
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:43,840
The one thing though is he's hitting it
like our Kung Fu guy because that's what

1976
01:50:43,841 --> 01:50:47,110
the Kung Fu guys, that's what I have a
problem with. The Kung Fu guys react.

1977
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:48,430
They do techniques,

1978
01:50:48,431 --> 01:50:51,820
they practice techniques as if the other
person isn't going to react like the

1979
01:50:51,821 --> 01:50:56,260
grab you and pull you like this and
attack the liver from this position.

1980
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:58,480
You know, and they have all
this nonsense like, well,

1981
01:50:58,481 --> 01:51:01,120
how do you know the guys still gonna
be there? I know you have a game plan,

1982
01:51:01,330 --> 01:51:02,380
but it seems to me like you're,

1983
01:51:02,590 --> 01:51:05,200
this is like you're getting way ahead
of yourself. You're stupid dude.

1984
01:51:05,230 --> 01:51:09,100
Can I ask you a martial arts question?
Sure. This happened a very long time ago.

1985
01:51:09,101 --> 01:51:12,310
I used to work at a summer camp and um,

1986
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:15,650
they would have like a martial
artists come every, uh,

1987
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:19,270
every term till like demonstrate
martial arts to the kids.

1988
01:51:19,271 --> 01:51:22,840
And he was just some guy from
like some local Dojo or something.

1989
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:27,260
And so he would get a kid and he, his
fucking head man, he didn't like had it,

1990
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:30,630
he'd been shot like five times in the
head. He'd been, he'd been in Vietnam,

1991
01:51:30,631 --> 01:51:35,110
he was really intense fucking guy and
shot in the head, really heat something.

1992
01:51:35,111 --> 01:51:39,370
He took something to that, his head at
it like shrapnel, my head strap. So yeah,

1993
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:42,040
shot and had, probably not. So he, um,

1994
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:47,370
he bring a kid down and he do this thing
where he held the kid's wrist and he'd

1995
01:51:47,471 --> 01:51:49,690
slap him in the neck,
knocked the kid out,

1996
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:52,420
and then like they'd get the
kid to stand back up again.

1997
01:51:52,421 --> 01:51:55,210
And it was something I've always
liked from time to time. Wonder, like,

1998
01:51:55,211 --> 01:51:59,110
what the fuck was that? Is that real?
Well, how hard did he hit the kid?

1999
01:51:59,590 --> 01:52:02,580
I just like a slap, you know? It was
like, it didn't sound really hard. No.

2000
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:06,210
Then it's bullshit. So the kid was
just like, what is that hypnosis? Why?

2001
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:09,770
It's a lot of, is the power of suggestion.
A lot of people, a lot of people do,

2002
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:11,650
and this is a very uncomfortable subject.

2003
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:14,380
I think a lot of people
have very weak brains.

2004
01:52:14,381 --> 01:52:16,600
Just like some dudes have little dicks.
You know,

2005
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:19,930
you ever seen a guy in a movie and
like it has a little duck. You laugh.

2006
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:24,550
It's so small. You laugh. There's,
there's people, little brains to their,

2007
01:52:24,551 --> 01:52:29,150
they have a little Dick. That's what it
is. Their brain just sucks. That sucks.

2008
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:32,490
Yeah. And that's why when you go to
see, didn't you go with me to the,

2009
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:34,510
the Boston comedy connection?

2010
01:52:34,511 --> 01:52:38,130
Didn't you see the r rated hypnotists
with me now already went on stage.

2011
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:41,020
Now I didn't see that and see that.
Damn, I wish I thought it was you.

2012
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:44,950
Brian was at you. Were you there when the
r rated hypnotist? No, Muslim and Joey,

2013
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:46,160
but the book.

2014
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:49,370
But you know when you watch an r
rated hitmen to show rest in peace.

2015
01:52:49,371 --> 01:52:53,750
Mr. Frank Santos, who was the guy that
I'm discussing in a longtime friend, um,

2016
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:55,920
very hilarious already hypnotists,

2017
01:52:55,970 --> 01:53:00,470
but he would go onstage and
he bring people and they
would sit down and with the,

2018
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:05,050
the smallest amount of work, I mean close
rise. Concentrate on what I'm saying.

2019
01:53:05,230 --> 01:53:08,750
I'm not a concert and my breath, I'm
going to three, two, one. When I hit one,

2020
01:53:08,930 --> 01:53:12,200
you're going to think you're with Madonna,
Madonna,

2021
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:16,610
like his backward McDonald's hot McDonna's
underneath you and she's naked and

2022
01:53:16,611 --> 01:53:21,500
you're going to have you, we, we inside a
Madonna on account of one on three, two,

2023
01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:24,830
one. Where are you John? Oh,

2024
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:29,810
you see this guy who is just a normal
person? It was just 1520 seconds ago.

2025
01:53:29,930 --> 01:53:32,930
He was just sitting there with
his eyes closed and now this,

2026
01:53:32,931 --> 01:53:37,340
this guy really thinks he's
fucking Madonna. Like wash
the guy, come in his pants.

2027
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:39,110
I watched a guy come in his pants.

2028
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:42,260
Frank Santos told him to come
and his pants and he's like, oh,

2029
01:53:42,261 --> 01:53:45,590
you're not going to be able to hold her.
You gonna come. Oh, and the guy goes, ugh.

2030
01:53:45,770 --> 01:53:49,610
The guy came in his fucking
pants. He was embarrassed. He was,

2031
01:53:49,611 --> 01:53:52,580
it wasn't an act. He
wasn't an actor. He wasn't,

2032
01:53:52,730 --> 01:53:57,290
there's no way an actor could
be that good. I mean, it
was this, it was the, the,

2033
01:53:57,560 --> 01:54:02,180
the look of confusion on his face when
frank cleared him up and sent him out of

2034
01:54:02,181 --> 01:54:03,360
it and went back to his friends,

2035
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:08,400
have to be at scratch act or to come to
make friends with him and do you came

2036
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:12,440
your fucking pants. Everybody was going
nuts. He went back to sit with his group.

2037
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:15,800
He didn't believe what had happened. He
was like, no, I knew what I was doing.

2038
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:19,060
I wouldn't do it. He was the
fuck you did dude. Like the,

2039
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:23,210
they go into this trance. I don't know
how it works. It doesn't work on me.

2040
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:24,411
This work I do.

2041
01:54:24,411 --> 01:54:28,250
It's like an old magic trick where like
that dude was a really a paid actor.

2042
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:30,680
That's part of what that
kind of hypnotism is. I mean,

2043
01:54:30,681 --> 01:54:34,820
there's different kinds of hypnotism is
there's hypnotism where you can sit down

2044
01:54:34,821 --> 01:54:39,680
and someone can put you in a very
relaxed state where you are, uh,

2045
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:44,510
cleared of all your distractions and
cleared of all your connections to the

2046
01:54:44,511 --> 01:54:46,850
world.
And they talk you through this.

2047
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,680
They talk you into a mindset where you're
open to suggestion and where you're

2048
01:54:51,681 --> 01:54:54,190
open to objectivity.
There's a, that's a type of,

2049
01:54:54,380 --> 01:54:58,220
of hypnotism and it's a legitimate type
of hypnotism and it does get you to a

2050
01:54:58,221 --> 01:55:01,790
certain state, but you're conscious
of what's going on the whole time.

2051
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:03,590
He's not getting you to suck his dick.

2052
01:55:03,710 --> 01:55:05,600
He's not telling you there's
an elephant in the room.

2053
01:55:05,601 --> 01:55:06,950
It's going to cut your head off.
You know,

2054
01:55:06,951 --> 01:55:10,490
he's not freaking you out with
bullshit and nonsense and trickery.

2055
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:12,930
He's just kind of guiding
your thought pattern.

2056
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:17,120
But there's also a type of hypnosis
that doesn't work on everybody,

2057
01:55:17,330 --> 01:55:20,700
but it does work on dummies
and that dummy hypnosis. You,

2058
01:55:20,701 --> 01:55:22,220
if you're a guy like Frank Santos,

2059
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:26,180
you can get people to think they're
having sex with Madonna in a stage on a

2060
01:55:26,181 --> 01:55:30,140
stage in front of 300 strangers.
You really can do it. I've seen it.

2061
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:31,520
I don't understand it,

2062
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:34,220
but I don't understand people that are
allergic to peanuts either. I don't,

2063
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:37,400
I don't think the human body
is, it's not uniform. There's,

2064
01:55:37,401 --> 01:55:40,550
there's some people that have a weird
glitch. It's like, you know, some,

2065
01:55:40,551 --> 01:55:43,050
some cell phones you can fucking
hack into them, you know,

2066
01:55:43,051 --> 01:55:44,100
so when somebody else's cell

2067
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,480
phone, but see, here's the thing.

2068
01:55:45,570 --> 01:55:50,570
So if Frank Santos can make a man and
Boston blast in his pants from four

2069
01:55:52,621 --> 01:55:54,540
seconds of mild hypnosis,

2070
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:59,070
think what the fucking CIA can do to you
if they've been studying this shit for

2071
01:55:59,071 --> 01:56:01,070
like 15 or 20 years.

2072
01:56:01,110 --> 01:56:04,500
No. Let's see. The sacrifices they've
made to in the, in the, you know,

2073
01:56:04,501 --> 01:56:06,750
the name of progress when it comes to Lsd,

2074
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:10,920
they dosed a whole fucking village in
France, including women and children.

2075
01:56:10,921 --> 01:56:13,470
They dose their bread. You
know about that story? Nope.

2076
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:17,250
The freedom of Information Act, it was,
it was revealed like, I don't know shit,

2077
01:56:17,251 --> 01:56:20,910
I want to say 2009 but I don't remember
when the exact date it was revealed,

2078
01:56:20,911 --> 01:56:25,200
but the CIA did a fucking LSD experiment
in a small French town and dose the

2079
01:56:25,201 --> 01:56:26,700
entire town. Here, I'll look it up.

2080
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:31,940
CIA dosed French town acid.

2081
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:33,211
Yeah.
Dude,

2082
01:56:33,211 --> 01:56:38,211
they didn't give a fuck here at the
CIA dosed entire village with LSD.

2083
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,820
Yup.
Incredible story.

2084
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:45,270
Back in the 50s and entire
French village suddenly went mad.

2085
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:46,370
It was not as prevalent.

2086
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:50,250
The previously thought due to an Erg
got fungus contamination of the village

2087
01:56:50,251 --> 01:56:54,690
bake his bread, says
investigative journalists, HP
Aberly, blah, blah, blah, blah,

2088
01:56:54,691 --> 01:56:59,100
blah. Instead, it was part of a CIA
secret mind control experiment with LSD.

2089
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:03,930
In other words, the CIA put a French
village on acid to study them.

2090
01:57:04,010 --> 01:57:08,660
Wow. Wow. And by the way, they're
responsible for the fucking unit monomer.

2091
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:11,730
Do you ever watch that
documentary that yeah. Yeah.

2092
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:14,330
He was a part of the fucking LSD
experiments and Harvard. Yeah.

2093
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:16,400
G W W what a shocker.

2094
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:20,230
You think there's a coincidence in
that the one guy gets so crazy that he

2095
01:57:20,231 --> 01:57:25,060
decides to make enough money
as a mathematics professor
to fund his attack on

2096
01:57:25,061 --> 01:57:27,520
all the technology of the world
and the way he's going to do this,

2097
01:57:27,521 --> 01:57:30,040
to send bombs through the mail at
people that are creating things.

2098
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:30,740
Well, see, that's the thing.

2099
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:35,480
That's why you have to begin to ask
yourself which components of my belief

2100
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:40,310
system or if things that I've arrived to
naturally from my observation of nature

2101
01:57:40,490 --> 01:57:45,490
and which parts of them are placed in to
me by a system designed to turn people

2102
01:57:46,971 --> 01:57:51,110
into consumers. And I think
that more often or not, uh,

2103
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:56,000
a greater percentage of your personality
then you would like his is not you at

2104
01:57:56,001 --> 01:57:56,540
all.

2105
01:57:56,540 --> 01:58:01,540
It's a tapestry that's been cleverly
woven by a system designed to make people

2106
01:58:02,151 --> 01:58:04,100
feel totally normal,

2107
01:58:04,101 --> 01:58:08,510
spending the majority of their lives
driving in a commute and working in a shit

2108
01:58:08,511 --> 01:58:12,130
job and being tired all the time.
First of all,

2109
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:14,700
let me just say that apparently this is a,

2110
01:58:14,701 --> 01:58:17,610
this theory of the French
town as a also questioned.

2111
01:58:17,730 --> 01:58:19,950
Some people don't agree with it.
Some people don't think it's true.

2112
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:23,460
Well they were dosing fucking ah,
they, they, they deal some soldiers,

2113
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:28,560
soldiers and they were dosing horrors
were dropping it into their John's drinks.

2114
01:58:28,561 --> 01:58:30,470
That was a rolling stone
article, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

2115
01:58:30,750 --> 01:58:34,860
[inaudible] what the fuck was it called?
How's operation? Midnight Climax.

2116
01:58:34,950 --> 01:58:37,200
That's what it's called.
The CIA ran a brothel. Oh.

2117
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:39,550
In San Francisco. In
New York. And they, uh,

2118
01:58:39,551 --> 01:58:43,540
they dose the Johns because they find
any willing participants and their LSD

2119
01:58:43,541 --> 01:58:43,841
studies.

2120
01:58:43,841 --> 01:58:47,770
Cause unfortunately the gay people like
Pepsi bottles full of Shit and blew

2121
01:58:47,771 --> 01:58:51,220
their fucking brains out. You know,
they weren't sure the dosage. You know,

2122
01:58:51,221 --> 01:58:53,150
when I first started
fucking around with us,

2123
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:57,970
she wanted to know what would happen.
Yeah. The shots, the whiskey Sun.

2124
01:58:58,060 --> 01:59:01,030
God do a shot of whiskey and you
actually do want a shot of acid.

2125
01:59:01,810 --> 01:59:04,000
You know what Mckenna
described molecularly? He said,

2126
01:59:04,001 --> 01:59:08,950
LSD has the power of an aunt that could
disassemble the entire statue of Liberty

2127
01:59:08,951 --> 01:59:13,030
in 30 minutes. He was, that's
molecularly, that's what it's like.

2128
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:15,310
That's how strong acid is the past.

2129
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:21,400
But imagine you like getting in in a
town and you don't know you're having it.

2130
01:59:21,470 --> 01:59:22,480
So a lot of people that don't know,

2131
01:59:22,481 --> 01:59:25,390
that's the number one theory
of the Salem witch trials.

2132
01:59:25,690 --> 01:59:28,510
The Salem witch trials has to do with
the first thing that they were saying

2133
01:59:28,511 --> 01:59:29,890
about as previously thought it was a,

2134
01:59:29,891 --> 01:59:33,400
an Erg got fungus contamination
of the village, Baker's bread.

2135
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:37,170
Apparently what happens is
when you have a crop of, um,

2136
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:42,010
like wheat or whatever the fuck it is,
any, any kind of grain and um, you,

2137
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:44,920
it freezes if they have
a frost and then it,

2138
01:59:45,110 --> 01:59:48,760
when it thaws out apparently is
susceptible to certain funguses.

2139
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:53,080
Like it fucks up the plant and the plant
gets contaminated sometimes by certain

2140
01:59:53,081 --> 01:59:57,880
funguses and forgot when it contaminated
the, you know, when they, they've,

2141
01:59:57,970 --> 02:00:01,660
they've like done core samples of this,
this point in time, you know, whenever,

2142
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:02,020
you know,

2143
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:05,980
the 1600 whenever the Salem witch trials
were and they found like these late

2144
02:00:05,981 --> 02:00:10,180
frosts that they think could have
attributed to ergo infection and then they

2145
02:00:10,181 --> 02:00:11,260
found evidence of Ergo.

2146
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:14,950
So they're pretty sure that when all
these people went mad and crazy and they

2147
02:00:14,951 --> 02:00:18,460
started burning women, you know, it's
just like they just, they just went,

2148
02:00:18,490 --> 02:00:19,870
they were whacked out on,

2149
02:00:19,930 --> 02:00:22,540
on their bread and they thought
that someone was poisoning them.

2150
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:26,800
It really did think it was which class,
which makes much more sense than,

2151
02:00:26,801 --> 02:00:31,000
you know, like it was just a religious
thing. It was just, which is possible.

2152
02:00:31,001 --> 02:00:34,120
I mean, we, we've seen horrible things
done in the name of religion, but when,

2153
02:00:34,121 --> 02:00:37,180
as a whole group of them and it's all in
one area and all those other pieces are

2154
02:00:37,181 --> 02:00:37,661
in place,

2155
02:00:37,661 --> 02:00:41,740
there's a fucking psychedelic compound
that makes you lose your marbles and it's

2156
02:00:41,741 --> 02:00:45,190
in your bread. Of course. That's what
happened. I mean, it only makes sense.

2157
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:48,110
Why is this? Why is this one
area think it's bewitched? Yeah,

2158
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:51,790
because they were right. There was, there
was this fucking chemical bewitching.

2159
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:53,860
You know,
they just blamed it on the wrong people.

2160
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:57,700
They didn't blame it on the bread. Well,
how would they know? How will they know?

2161
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:00,970
Yeah, so these crazy ass, I'll start that.
These, these women were witches. You know,

2162
02:01:00,971 --> 02:01:02,750
they'd look at, I'm all paranoid
just talking about just the one.

2163
02:01:02,751 --> 02:01:04,570
She's doing this to me.
You know, really mean.

2164
02:01:04,571 --> 02:01:08,800
He's seeing giant mice attacking him with,
you know, invisible swords. You know,

2165
02:01:08,801 --> 02:01:12,550
you've seen all kinds of
crazy shit everywhere he goes.
It's really, yeah. Strange

2166
02:01:12,580 --> 02:01:17,580
to think that books have been
written about how to torture witches.

2167
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:21,610
There's a book. Have you ever heard of
the Malleus Melissa Kerem? Jesus? No.

2168
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:24,370
Look that up. The Hammer, what is it
called? It's called, it's called them,

2169
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:28,960
I believe the Malleus. [inaudible]. It's
called the hammer of the witches. Look.

2170
02:01:28,961 --> 02:01:32,350
That shit appetite, Karen. Yeah,
I think it's Melissa. Karen.

2171
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:35,560
I'm probably butchering the name, but
if you put that in, you should find it.

2172
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:38,910
And if that hasn't worked,
put in Dude fucking in and it's amazing.

2173
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:41,590
I knew spelled the shit out of
it and it's still the found,

2174
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:46,370
it's the way to spell correctly folks
is the Malleus, m a l l E. U. S.

2175
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:49,730
Is that an l? L l. L. E. U. S. Uh,

2176
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:54,910
and Melika carried them Mel if a carrier
Kerem Melvin Kerem [inaudible] is m,

2177
02:01:57,201 --> 02:02:00,170
a, l e, F, I, C, a, r, u, m.

2178
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:03,390
And just get an approximation and
then Google and just finds it for you.

2179
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:05,650
[inaudible] of the
witches. That's incredible.

2180
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:10,640
It's a book that was written
during the inquisition. Oh my God.

2181
02:02:10,670 --> 02:02:14,450
It's available on Amazon. God love
the Internet. I'm going to order that.

2182
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:18,260
Watch this. Watch this while
we're doing the podcast. Boom.

2183
02:02:18,261 --> 02:02:22,370
Bitches ordered that shit son.
1996.

2184
02:02:22,371 --> 02:02:26,180
I'm on dope was up. I just
bought an awesome book after
the witch trials though.

2185
02:02:26,181 --> 02:02:27,200
It, it, they,

2186
02:02:27,650 --> 02:02:31,220
they still were eating
the same bread though.

2187
02:02:31,221 --> 02:02:35,900
Wouldn't they still be crazy? You
know, like if that was true, no,

2188
02:02:35,990 --> 02:02:39,710
because it didn't last for very long.
It's only for one season. So you know,

2189
02:02:39,711 --> 02:02:43,040
for one season or whatever season that
this happens where they get this green

2190
02:02:43,041 --> 02:02:44,630
and this grant is infected with the Ergo.

2191
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:46,760
That's the season where
everyone's jacked and fucked up.

2192
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:48,990
But Mckinnon's theory was,

2193
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:53,480
was I think more that it wasn't
that these people are freaking out.

2194
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:56,630
This isn't mcallister was a mainstream,
uh,

2195
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:01,790
like I guess it was archeologists is that
call archaeology when you only go back

2196
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:06,390
a couple hundred years. History
that can be archived. I don't know.

2197
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:08,420
I think there's a difference between
historians and archaeologists.

2198
02:03:08,421 --> 02:03:12,980
I'd love to know, but I, there,
I've read Mckenna talking about how,

2199
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:17,520
um, the getting rid of the
witches, it was part of the, uh,

2200
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:22,660
transformation from the into male
dominated culture and that that was the

2201
02:03:24,021 --> 02:03:28,010
burning of the witches was
a representation of this
shift from what does he has

2202
02:03:28,011 --> 02:03:30,950
a great name for it. Dominator culture
or something. What does he call it?

2203
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:34,180
The shift from the, uh,
the, uh, he was, uh,

2204
02:03:34,230 --> 02:03:39,030
from maternal society to Terminal
Matriarchal Mushroom Society Mushrooms.

2205
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:43,980
She's a patriarchy that where the way
that you taught people is through like,

2206
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:47,960
like the God of that society teaches
people by beating the shit out of them and

2207
02:03:47,961 --> 02:03:52,160
punishing them forever. It's not the
way that I'm a mother is supposed to be.

2208
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:57,340
And so the witch trials where the shift
from a one form of nature based religion

2209
02:03:58,761 --> 02:04:00,300
into a new form of,

2210
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:04,790
of religion where people
started worshiping the
invisible like free chromophobe

2211
02:04:04,791 --> 02:04:06,560
make that possible.

2212
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:10,680
But the other finding I
think was after it was like,

2213
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:13,640
I think it was even after
Mckenna was dead, Mckenna,

2214
02:04:13,641 --> 02:04:16,550
I believe.in 2001 I think this was,

2215
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:21,140
I think they discovered this little later.
So it's kind of clear evidence.

2216
02:04:21,141 --> 02:04:23,760
I think it's just combinations because
there were, it could be that too.

2217
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:26,270
Then back then who were practicing.

2218
02:04:26,690 --> 02:04:29,470
It could be that would have never
killed the witches if it was like a,

2219
02:04:29,471 --> 02:04:32,060
a balanced society, they will
just go, oh, you're fucking,

2220
02:04:32,061 --> 02:04:34,520
which I'll know you're not. Oh my God.
I was on acid or something, you know,

2221
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:38,040
they wouldn't like get together with
pitchforks and fucking torches. Maybe

2222
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:41,580
it could be they were already pissed off
at checks and then when they got on the

2223
02:04:41,581 --> 02:04:44,490
acid or the Irgun rather they'd be like,
well this is a fucking,

2224
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:46,950
this is a perfect time to kill
all these bitches. You know,

2225
02:04:46,951 --> 02:04:50,850
it could be that this is the last straw
when you know, it's a weird thing man,

2226
02:04:50,851 --> 02:04:51,361
when you know,

2227
02:04:51,361 --> 02:04:56,361
the whole idea of happiness and pleasure
is a lot of it revolves around people

2228
02:04:57,601 --> 02:04:58,620
wanting to be around you.

2229
02:04:58,621 --> 02:05:01,920
And a lot of it revolves around the
opposite sex wanting to be around you.

2230
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:04,820
And for most of us, you know, look,

2231
02:05:05,070 --> 02:05:07,630
the reality is most of us are
not that attractive. You know,

2232
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:11,130
there's not that many people that
are really, really attracted to you.

2233
02:05:11,131 --> 02:05:12,330
And for a lot of people,

2234
02:05:12,331 --> 02:05:17,331
their life is a constant series of
rejections and especially from women guys,

2235
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:18,090
they're dumpy.

2236
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:21,180
They have no self esteem and they'd
get a couple of drinks in them.

2237
02:05:21,181 --> 02:05:23,640
And who you think maybe
I'll get a flow could good.

2238
02:05:23,641 --> 02:05:28,620
Some of the nurse he like say
something awful and knowing, you know,

2239
02:05:28,621 --> 02:05:31,290
like really it's just
like a lack of confidence.

2240
02:05:31,291 --> 02:05:33,030
Like people would say
that they're a Dickhead,

2241
02:05:33,150 --> 02:05:36,540
but really a lot of it is
like a preemptive attack
because you think eventually

2242
02:05:36,541 --> 02:05:39,600
this person is going to destroy your
soul because that's your experience with

2243
02:05:39,601 --> 02:05:42,480
relationships. That's your experience
with interacting with women.

2244
02:05:42,481 --> 02:05:44,280
Every time you've attempted
to interact with women,

2245
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:48,160
they've let you know
that your pulsive Ooh,

2246
02:05:49,930 --> 02:05:53,460
no thank you.
It'll get away.

2247
02:05:53,670 --> 02:05:58,670
And that programming just enters into
this guy's definition of what a woman is,

2248
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:02,670
of what you know who you want. You're
the person who brings the bad feelings.

2249
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:05,140
You're the person who brings,
it's horrible, horrible. Sure.

2250
02:06:05,570 --> 02:06:10,570
So you get a few drinks and have low
spots where you're pissed and you're

2251
02:06:11,011 --> 02:06:11,431
fucking,

2252
02:06:11,431 --> 02:06:15,810
all of a sudden you're like using tricks
from the game to try to say shitty

2253
02:06:15,811 --> 02:06:20,040
things to girls, to like dis Dell
that discombobulate them in somehow,

2254
02:06:20,041 --> 02:06:23,310
like trick them into fucking you instead
of just getting them to have sex with

2255
02:06:23,311 --> 02:06:26,360
you because they like you because you're
a good person. You're fucking cool. Well,

2256
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:28,740
I don't think people can realize that
in part of the reason why people can't

2257
02:06:28,741 --> 02:06:30,810
realize that as because
people are selfish. You know,

2258
02:06:30,811 --> 02:06:32,910
I have a friend and I
who will remain nameless,

2259
02:06:32,911 --> 02:06:35,030
but we had a conversation where he was,
uh,

2260
02:06:35,370 --> 02:06:39,090
he was getting dumped and he was super
upset about it and he didn't know how to

2261
02:06:39,091 --> 02:06:42,840
deal with it. And he was asking me for
advice and I said, do you love this girl?

2262
02:06:42,930 --> 02:06:46,380
And he said, yes. And I said, well, if you
love her, you should want her to be happy.

2263
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:51,000
And if her being happy means her being
with another man or another person,

2264
02:06:51,180 --> 02:06:54,360
you should respect that and you
should love her still. I go,

2265
02:06:54,361 --> 02:06:57,750
this is just a human being and people
break up and I don't hate everyone.

2266
02:06:57,751 --> 02:07:01,260
I used to date, in fact with
time, I love all of them.

2267
02:07:01,261 --> 02:07:03,120
Even the ones that I
didn't get along with men,

2268
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:06,810
when I look back on every single girl
that I ever dated, I swear to God,

2269
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:10,800
I only will allow the positive thing.

2270
02:07:10,830 --> 02:07:13,050
I have some negative stories that
are really funny and I tell them,

2271
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:15,930
but in my mind when I'm
thinking about that person,

2272
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:19,080
I only think about them when I loved
them. I only think about them. What are,

2273
02:07:19,081 --> 02:07:22,680
no matter what went wrong, you
know, no matter what, you know what,

2274
02:07:22,681 --> 02:07:26,310
what horrible thing was said, you know,
that made the whole thing fall apart.

2275
02:07:26,310 --> 02:07:31,020
I re I refuse to define them by that
and I instead define them by their

2276
02:07:31,021 --> 02:07:34,830
potential, by what, what they meant
to me when they're at their best.

2277
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:38,470
But it's really fucking hard
to teach people that, man,

2278
02:07:38,471 --> 02:07:42,700
it's really hard to over and over again
realize when you fall face first into

2279
02:07:42,701 --> 02:07:43,211
the face,

2280
02:07:43,211 --> 02:07:47,050
first into the fucking dirt that you
thinking is incorrect and that it's not

2281
02:07:47,051 --> 02:07:50,680
empowering and you're not helping
yourself or anyone else. And in fact,

2282
02:07:50,681 --> 02:07:54,580
you're devaluing yourself into this
person's eyes because you become desperate

2283
02:07:54,581 --> 02:07:56,190
and you have no personal sovereign,
Ted's right.

2284
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:58,450
A man that can't be with
a woman without a woman,

2285
02:07:58,451 --> 02:08:01,690
when a woman doesn't want to be with
a man is a repulsive thing. You know,

2286
02:08:01,691 --> 02:08:03,700
we've all seen it, man. It
was an episode of fear factor.

2287
02:08:03,701 --> 02:08:04,530
We had this week where this,

2288
02:08:04,530 --> 02:08:07,360
there was this poor guy
and his wife didn't want to
have nothing to do with them

2289
02:08:07,361 --> 02:08:11,680
anymore. They divorced and she was
fucking, you know, just live in her life.

2290
02:08:11,681 --> 02:08:13,960
And they were still connected because
they had a kid together and she would just

2291
02:08:13,961 --> 02:08:18,290
mock him openly and publicly and she had
no desire to fuck him again and she was

2292
02:08:18,291 --> 02:08:21,130
kind of just ready to ready to
make fun of them. And it hurts.

2293
02:08:21,131 --> 02:08:25,360
It hurts washing it, man. It
hurts your fucking soul. It
cuts into you, you see it,

2294
02:08:25,361 --> 02:08:27,310
and you'd go to this poor fuck.
He doesn't even know.

2295
02:08:27,311 --> 02:08:29,560
He's just trapped in
this horrible pattern.

2296
02:08:29,561 --> 02:08:34,150
And this person has become
a drug dispenser, a negative
Downer drug is person,

2297
02:08:34,151 --> 02:08:37,900
gives them a depressing drug every time
they see them. It's crazy. It's amazing.

2298
02:08:37,930 --> 02:08:41,260
It's called, yeah, the bonds of Maya.
That's it. That's my name for it.

2299
02:08:41,261 --> 02:08:45,400
Or you get entangled in the illusory
aspect of the universe and you don't even

2300
02:08:45,401 --> 02:08:48,160
realize it and then you're
just fucking in pain.

2301
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:51,250
But you're the reason you're in pain.
It's so sad,

2302
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:55,910
but it's real and it's like it's,
it's a plague and,

2303
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:58,480
and, but it's, it's also kind of cool man.

2304
02:08:58,481 --> 02:09:01,510
That was kinds of prisons thought prisons
are the best presidents to get into

2305
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:04,780
because you have the key. You
say it out, get out of it though.

2306
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:08,300
But one of the things is you can't be
selfish because if you are a selfish,

2307
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:10,540
always want that person to be with you.
You know,

2308
02:09:10,541 --> 02:09:12,400
and this is what I was saying
to my friend. I was like, dude,

2309
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:15,610
she does not want to be with you.
You'll have to accept that.

2310
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,690
You have to accept that this is a human
being. And if you love this human being,

2311
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:21,940
you should want this
human being to be happy.

2312
02:09:22,270 --> 02:09:25,870
And your definition of love is his only.
He only loved this human being.

2313
02:09:25,870 --> 02:09:30,640
If the human being provides you with
the sex drug provides you with the sex

2314
02:09:30,641 --> 02:09:35,350
chemical, you can't just accept the fact
that she wants to sex drug from someone

2315
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:40,270
different. Her jeans are compelled
to fuck someone different than you.

2316
02:09:40,390 --> 02:09:44,050
And whether it's become because you have
personality shortcomings or physical

2317
02:09:44,051 --> 02:09:46,420
shortcomings.
It's not her responsibility.

2318
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:50,350
Her responsibility is to go towards what
she enjoys and what she's attracted to,

2319
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:55,570
but we are so selfish that no one
ever thinks that way, but also, man,

2320
02:09:55,630 --> 02:09:59,230
aside from like letting someone have a
happy life and not trying to manipulate

2321
02:09:59,231 --> 02:10:01,180
or control them into being stuck with you.

2322
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:05,050
The other thing is it's so much better
for you to be with someone who really

2323
02:10:05,051 --> 02:10:09,730
likes you. Kia. My God, the guys who
want to like change a chick, you know,

2324
02:10:09,870 --> 02:10:12,070
you grow to love me, my God, dude,

2325
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:15,580
some savage is going to come along
and fuck her in a laundromat. Okay,

2326
02:10:15,610 --> 02:10:17,230
that's going to happen.
You can't. You can't.

2327
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:21,820
Everyone needs to be extremely
attracted to each other.

2328
02:10:21,821 --> 02:10:23,300
Everyone needs to be extremely well.

2329
02:10:23,301 --> 02:10:26,620
There's just in track attracted to each
other's minds, which is personality,

2330
02:10:26,621 --> 02:10:30,420
whether it's physical, whatever it is,
they're there. There has to be a real,

2331
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:34,310
because if there's not, if you don't
have one of two things is happening,

2332
02:10:34,311 --> 02:10:38,570
either you're not putting that out enough.
You're not a dynamic enough human.

2333
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:42,830
Both with your consciousness or with your
objectivity or with your love or with

2334
02:10:42,831 --> 02:10:46,340
your affection or with
your, your, your generosity.

2335
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,140
You're not putting out enough working.

2336
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:50,660
And if you're not putting down out enough
people don't want to give it back to

2337
02:10:50,661 --> 02:10:55,340
you. So this, this beautiful,
attractive, healthy, vibrant,

2338
02:10:55,490 --> 02:10:56,241
generous,

2339
02:10:56,241 --> 02:11:00,020
loving person won't be attracted to you
because you don't want to enhance them.

2340
02:11:00,110 --> 02:11:01,850
You want to draw and take away from them.

2341
02:11:01,970 --> 02:11:06,830
And so you rely on wounded animals and
it's just one more wounded animal after

2342
02:11:06,831 --> 02:11:07,790
another wounded animal.

2343
02:11:07,791 --> 02:11:10,580
And that's all you ever get because
that's all you're attracting.

2344
02:11:10,700 --> 02:11:12,110
You're attracting wounded animals.

2345
02:11:12,111 --> 02:11:15,230
Cause those are the only ones that are
stupid enough to fucking fall into your

2346
02:11:15,231 --> 02:11:17,120
web. That's true, man.

2347
02:11:17,121 --> 02:11:21,320
And also a lot of those
systems that pickup systems
are designed to trap wounded

2348
02:11:21,321 --> 02:11:22,730
animals. She's like, exactly. Yeah.

2349
02:11:22,850 --> 02:11:26,330
So it's like really just praying the
vulnerable and it's only because the, the,

2350
02:11:26,331 --> 02:11:31,010
the value of sexuality, it's such a,
it's a value. It's very important.

2351
02:11:31,011 --> 02:11:34,550
Like you need it. Like it will make
you feel better, you know, it will,

2352
02:11:34,551 --> 02:11:36,770
it's your medicine. You
got to go, you know?

2353
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:41,500
Yeah, but you know there, there's
get it on like Marvin Gaye Song.

2354
02:11:41,650 --> 02:11:43,870
I'm your medicine.
Open up and let me in.

2355
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:46,630
It is a fucking drug man
dough and you're so great.

2356
02:11:46,631 --> 02:11:50,140
I can't wait for you to
operate. Boom, boom. Get up.

2357
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:52,900
Let's make love tonight.

2358
02:11:53,710 --> 02:11:58,180
Wake up cause you do it right. The
guy was a bad mother fucker. Dude,

2359
02:11:58,181 --> 02:12:00,040
he's such a bad motherfucker.
His Dad shot him.

2360
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:02,510
His Dad couldn't deal with the sun.

2361
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:07,440
Just massively eclipsing him in every
possible way as a human, as Dow.

2362
02:12:07,450 --> 02:12:11,230
Just a regular guy who is Marvin Gaye,
Marvin Gaye's, a motherfucking Dick,

2363
02:12:11,250 --> 02:12:16,130
sling and superstar with a voice that came
from angels. Okay, and who are you? Oh,

2364
02:12:16,131 --> 02:12:20,270
you're the guy who fucked his mom. Get in
line, bitch, you're just a normal dude.

2365
02:12:20,450 --> 02:12:23,120
You Ain't nothing special compared
to Marvin motherfucking Gaye.

2366
02:12:23,210 --> 02:12:27,230
You're a regular guy and you may
have son that's a mother fucker.

2367
02:12:27,470 --> 02:12:29,480
You made a psalm that his songs,

2368
02:12:29,540 --> 02:12:34,400
they play them without them words in
elevators and people sing along to the

2369
02:12:34,401 --> 02:12:35,234
music.

2370
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:39,860
His fucking songs are so good that
when you're in an elevator and a Muzak

2371
02:12:39,861 --> 02:12:43,320
version of let's get it on, comes
on, you can hear him saying,

2372
02:12:45,210 --> 02:12:48,710
let's get it all. You can
hear it. You can hear it.

2373
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:50,840
He's a bad motherfucker,
dude.

2374
02:12:50,841 --> 02:12:53,630
He and printed the consciousness
and this guy couldn't deal with it.

2375
02:12:53,631 --> 02:12:57,230
So he shot his own son,
didn't want to play the game.

2376
02:12:57,231 --> 02:13:02,030
So he picked up the board and he threw it
away. Yeah. Goodwin couldn't win a game,

2377
02:13:02,510 --> 02:13:07,280
unplugged it and plugged the fucking
x bucks, shooting your own kid.

2378
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:12,050
God, I don't care what he did.
You, you fuck someone fucked
up. It has to be you to,

2379
02:13:12,380 --> 02:13:15,050
unless your kid is a murderer and unless
your kids coming at you with a fucking

2380
02:13:15,051 --> 02:13:18,200
sword and trying to, he's, you know
he's on PCP. Yeah. Okay, I get it.

2381
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:20,600
You got to do what you gotta do.
He and he shouldn't. You know,

2382
02:13:20,601 --> 02:13:22,510
he's a threat to the playground.
Kid makes you,

2383
02:13:22,550 --> 02:13:26,180
you're automatically a fucking
idiot, right? Oh my God.
Yeah. Something happened,

2384
02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:28,940
which is why it's fucking weird.
The story of Jesus.

2385
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:32,370
It's like you're going to send your
fucking kid down to a planet is savage

2386
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:36,670
fucking you don't understand.
He died for our sins. Oh, that,

2387
02:13:37,290 --> 02:13:38,060
oh no.

2388
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:42,140
Somehow or another we could still sin,
but we get forgiven if we tell him,

2389
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:46,340
if we embrace him, you get forgiven.
You're allowed to still sin.

2390
02:13:46,370 --> 02:13:50,030
You could totally fuck up, but at the
end you have to like really realize and,

2391
02:13:50,031 --> 02:13:53,760
and really embrace Jesus as your God show.
What are you saying to do that?

2392
02:13:53,810 --> 02:13:56,690
Once you do it, it's not a crazy leg
escape clause. It's like, you know,

2393
02:13:56,691 --> 02:13:59,720
some corporations don't have to pay
any taxes at all and they can just fuck

2394
02:13:59,721 --> 02:14:02,030
everybody over and make trillions
and trillions of dollars. Anyone?

2395
02:14:02,090 --> 02:14:04,070
What kind of loophole was
that? That's ridiculous. Well,

2396
02:14:04,071 --> 02:14:06,590
they just have to pay the right
politicians and this loophole,

2397
02:14:06,591 --> 02:14:09,290
the death loophole is you can just
fucking rape and pillage your whole life.

2398
02:14:09,560 --> 02:14:14,420
But if you find Christianity at the end,
like general butt naked from Liberia,

2399
02:14:14,450 --> 02:14:16,650
you know that story?
There's Shane Smith. Yeah,

2400
02:14:16,660 --> 02:14:20,430
us on the podcast guys
directly responsible for the
death of thousands of people,

2401
02:14:20,710 --> 02:14:24,620
thousands of people. And he killed
babies and ate their hearts. Yeah.

2402
02:14:24,680 --> 02:14:26,330
Eight they're still beating hearts.
Okay.

2403
02:14:26,450 --> 02:14:29,510
And he's a Christian and because he's a
Christian, they didn't even prosecuted.

2404
02:14:29,540 --> 02:14:32,630
Praise God. How amazing these
guys, God, God, so beautiful.

2405
02:14:32,631 --> 02:14:34,550
God is going to put him in heaven,

2406
02:14:34,820 --> 02:14:39,820
but not like a regular person who's born
in the jungle of Brazil and is good his

2407
02:14:41,091 --> 02:14:45,260
whole life and only does good for his
tribe and his family and you know,

2408
02:14:45,261 --> 02:14:48,740
and has great respect for the earth.
That guys go straight to hell on earth.

2409
02:14:48,770 --> 02:14:52,490
That confer a Spec for the earth. I don't
want expect the origination Douche bag.

2410
02:14:52,491 --> 02:14:53,770
It's going right to the fucking oven,

2411
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:56,950
dude. Dude, do you know about
dispensations? Do you know what dispenser?

2412
02:14:56,980 --> 02:14:59,130
I believe they're called dispensations.
Do you know about this?

2413
02:14:59,770 --> 02:15:01,560
I may be saying that word wrong,

2414
02:15:01,561 --> 02:15:06,210
but it used to be able to buy from the
Catholic church for whom the ships used

2415
02:15:06,211 --> 02:15:09,540
to be able to do that. Yeah, you could
buy, say like, you could save your salary,

2416
02:15:09,541 --> 02:15:11,070
you could buy like no matter what,
you're going to have it.

2417
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:15,300
Like I gave you this much money. Yeah.
So I'm set like, here's like, you know,

2418
02:15:15,301 --> 02:15:18,000
whatever, to 200,000
bucks, I'm cool. Right?

2419
02:15:18,001 --> 02:15:20,790
No matter what I do for the rest of my
life, I'm still going to have, and like,

2420
02:15:20,791 --> 02:15:24,810
yeah, you're fine. You, you gave enough
money. Now you're fine. That's hilarious.

2421
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:27,900
It's amazing. That's the cat. That's
brilliant. Like the Catholic Church.

2422
02:15:27,910 --> 02:15:30,660
You know how funny that is to like come
up with a trick like that when you start

2423
02:15:30,661 --> 02:15:33,300
realizing like, wait a minute,
I can just write down on paper.

2424
02:15:33,780 --> 02:15:38,370
The people are going on an imaginary place
forever and they'll give me thousands

2425
02:15:38,370 --> 02:15:41,220
and thousands of dollars in
gold and diamonds. That's
incredible. It's incredible.

2426
02:15:41,221 --> 02:15:44,190
Like talking seriously
about like the tooth fairy,

2427
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:48,000
like if we were having a conversation
about the tooth fairy people were willing

2428
02:15:48,001 --> 02:15:49,420
to die for the tooth fairy.
Yeah.

2429
02:15:49,470 --> 02:15:52,470
They're willing to kill you
for degrading that tooth.

2430
02:15:52,471 --> 02:15:55,680
Fairies are real and it ruined their
lives. They're, they're willing to,

2431
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:58,650
they're willing to, um,
not use birth control.

2432
02:15:58,651 --> 02:16:02,970
They're willing to not wear condoms and
fucking bring kids into the world that

2433
02:16:02,971 --> 02:16:04,860
they didn't even want to
have for that tooth fairy.

2434
02:16:05,010 --> 02:16:07,830
They're willing to do a lot of
crazy shit for that tooth fairy.

2435
02:16:07,831 --> 02:16:11,640
And then there's a wide spectrum of
crazy and it varies from town to town.

2436
02:16:11,910 --> 02:16:15,960
Church called the church call it. And I
think that there's like a re, you know,

2437
02:16:16,050 --> 02:16:20,760
there's something that's an actual, you
know, I think there, there really is a,

2438
02:16:20,830 --> 02:16:23,670
I don't know what you call it, but I do
think there's like a super consciousness.

2439
02:16:23,671 --> 02:16:24,720
You can tune into that.

2440
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:28,770
We'll give you some direction and the
directions usually don't be an asshole.

2441
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:30,010
Well, why? I was saying that

2442
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:33,670
the morality of the universe would tell
you that you're not allowed to spray

2443
02:16:33,671 --> 02:16:35,800
pepper spray in the face
of kneeling children.

2444
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:39,130
The morality of the university
say these are peaceful people.

2445
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:41,380
You have no right to do
anything to harm them.

2446
02:16:41,381 --> 02:16:43,710
They have a legitimate gripe and concern.
Whether they're handling,

2447
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:46,620
they have the correct way is
debatable, but you, you know the,

2448
02:16:46,621 --> 02:16:50,680
the morality of the universe, the true
knowledge of what is right and wrong.

2449
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:54,880
It's like instinctively,
instantly you realize that's an evil task.

2450
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:58,090
And if that was your little girl,
that's your 18 year old girl.

2451
02:16:58,091 --> 02:16:59,750
Idealistic first day and you know,

2452
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:04,030
first year in college and this asshole
is spraying her in the face with pepper

2453
02:17:04,031 --> 02:17:08,320
spray, you'd want to beat his brain
flat. You'd want to beat him to death.

2454
02:17:08,321 --> 02:17:13,000
If that was, if I saw that
guy spray my baby in the face,

2455
02:17:13,210 --> 02:17:17,230
I would not be able to help myself. It
wouldn't, if there was cars in the way,

2456
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:18,760
if there was a cops in the way,

2457
02:17:18,761 --> 02:17:21,130
I would have tried physically
to get my hands on it.

2458
02:17:21,580 --> 02:17:25,050
I would have to really stop
myself. It would be like, uh,

2459
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:30,100
like a murderous animal like
rampage. You would, you would,

2460
02:17:30,101 --> 02:17:33,850
you would feel it from the bottom of
your DNA that you would have to stop this

2461
02:17:33,851 --> 02:17:34,900
person from doing that.

2462
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:38,050
We want this guy's doing
it because somebody wrote
some shit down on a piece of

2463
02:17:38,051 --> 02:17:40,180
paper that's a detachment man.

2464
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:43,780
That's a detachment from the f the
things that you do and the impact those

2465
02:17:43,781 --> 02:17:48,070
things have. And you could say followed
by the word of the law and you could say,

2466
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:51,880
well, those full can hoop is weren't
them. We would never have a problem.

2467
02:17:52,060 --> 02:17:54,880
And while all these things are correct,
that's not the real issue.

2468
02:17:54,910 --> 02:17:59,260
The real issue is there's a detachment
from the things we do and the effect

2469
02:17:59,261 --> 02:18:00,940
those things have and that attachment,

2470
02:18:00,941 --> 02:18:03,820
that detachment is due
to a lack of sensitivity,

2471
02:18:03,821 --> 02:18:07,780
which I think can be attributed to several
things and a lot of it is contributed

2472
02:18:07,781 --> 02:18:11,290
to awareness and our focus on awareness,
whether it's through yoga,

2473
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:14,410
whether it's through meditation,
whether it's to isolation tanks,

2474
02:18:14,411 --> 02:18:17,320
whether it's through psychedelics,
what is through long walks,

2475
02:18:17,321 --> 02:18:21,790
where you sit by yourself in the alone
in the park and you do an audit of your

2476
02:18:21,791 --> 02:18:25,810
day and an audit of your true honest
thoughts and try to be a fucking real with

2477
02:18:25,811 --> 02:18:26,644
yourself man.

2478
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:29,140
And don't bullshit yourself so you can
sleep better at night and think that

2479
02:18:29,141 --> 02:18:30,310
you're doing the right thing every time.

2480
02:18:30,430 --> 02:18:33,400
And all you would have
to do is imply though,

2481
02:18:33,401 --> 02:18:37,780
apply those ideas to life
and everyone would be fine.

2482
02:18:37,930 --> 02:18:40,450
Everyone would be fun,
could no one would ever start unjust wars.

2483
02:18:41,050 --> 02:18:42,610
They would realize you can profit anyway.

2484
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:44,070
There's always going to
be assholes out there.

2485
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:48,130
You can profit on fucking tanks and you
can profit on jets. We need those. Yeah,

2486
02:18:48,131 --> 02:18:51,460
we do need those. But we don't need that
many and we don't need them everywhere.

2487
02:18:51,461 --> 02:18:54,010
We don't need a a military presence
in over a hundred different fucking

2488
02:18:54,011 --> 02:18:54,580
countries.

2489
02:18:54,580 --> 02:18:58,090
We've gotten completely out of hand those
people making jets and making bombs,

2490
02:18:58,091 --> 02:19:00,670
making guns. I'm a, I'm a
hundred percent pro gun.

2491
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:04,600
I have guns and I think that you should
be allowed to have gone pro hunting.

2492
02:19:04,601 --> 02:19:08,460
And I'm, I'm pro trapping. Um,
I'm, I'm pro all that Shit, man. I,

2493
02:19:08,461 --> 02:19:11,620
I believe in the Second Amendment
fully, strongly support. You're right.

2494
02:19:13,030 --> 02:19:14,140
But I think,

2495
02:19:15,220 --> 02:19:19,780
I just think we're at a stage right now
where people are starting to realize

2496
02:19:19,930 --> 02:19:24,070
that the stuff that's written down on
paper is not necessarily serving the human

2497
02:19:24,071 --> 02:19:27,040
beings that it's supposed to represent.
And we just,

2498
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:30,260
because it's written down on paper and
because of bunch of people say it's

2499
02:19:30,261 --> 02:19:32,810
written down on paper,
we are supposed to abide by it.

2500
02:19:32,830 --> 02:19:33,860
We're supposed to deal with it.

2501
02:19:33,861 --> 02:19:37,700
We're supposed to allow that cop to
spray the chemical and the kid's face and

2502
02:19:37,701 --> 02:19:40,370
not get beaten up and immediately
thrown in jail. Like he should be.

2503
02:19:40,371 --> 02:19:44,360
Like your instincts would
be if any civilian did it.
And that's our real issue.

2504
02:19:44,361 --> 02:19:45,620
Our real issue is we're,
we're,

2505
02:19:45,650 --> 02:19:50,160
we are operating under an archaic
society using the wrong map. Yes.

2506
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:53,300
We're using an old shitty map that
worked at different kinds of terrain.

2507
02:19:53,301 --> 02:19:56,150
The terrain has changed now we need,
we need to new maps.

2508
02:19:56,390 --> 02:19:58,070
People have got to come up with new maps.

2509
02:19:58,220 --> 02:20:02,150
You don't just get the fucking luxury
of using an ancient, whether it all map,

2510
02:20:02,151 --> 02:20:03,290
whatever the fuck the map is,

2511
02:20:03,291 --> 02:20:06,630
whether the map is your Bible
or whether the map is, um,

2512
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:10,430
the current version of the constitution
with all the amendments or whether the

2513
02:20:10,431 --> 02:20:11,390
map,
whatever it is,

2514
02:20:11,630 --> 02:20:15,860
it's time to start making new maps
based on the fact that we're now all

2515
02:20:15,861 --> 02:20:18,410
connected. When you see things
like this new bill that's passed,

2516
02:20:18,411 --> 02:20:22,110
it turns American into a battleground
and empowers the military to come in and,

2517
02:20:22,380 --> 02:20:22,970
and,
and,

2518
02:20:22,970 --> 02:20:27,970
and arrest civilians who
are being disorderly and
arrest anyone who is a threat

2519
02:20:27,971 --> 02:20:31,460
and detain them. Anyone who
they deem a thread. That is the,

2520
02:20:31,461 --> 02:20:33,980
all the evidence that you
need to know that it's over.

2521
02:20:34,190 --> 02:20:38,630
That is the monsters clawing at the
fucking, at the head. The, the, the,

2522
02:20:38,631 --> 02:20:43,070
the gravestone is it pulls
them underground as the
earth sucks them into its

2523
02:20:43,071 --> 02:20:47,300
core. The monsters are clawing
as they're dragged down.

2524
02:20:47,301 --> 02:20:50,510
They are trying as hard as
possible to gain ground.

2525
02:20:50,570 --> 02:20:53,450
And one way they're going to do it is
completely violate the bill of rights.

2526
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:56,450
Where they're going to do it is to
make the constitution and valid.

2527
02:20:56,570 --> 02:20:57,530
And that's what they're doing.

2528
02:20:57,531 --> 02:21:01,250
And they're doing it under the
guise of patriotism and protection.

2529
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:05,870
And you're like protection from
what you fucks. But see, that's why.

2530
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:10,540
That's why they're there. What, what has
to happen is people need to start, um,

2531
02:21:10,610 --> 02:21:13,550
continuing to take like the action
they're taking with occupy Wall Street.

2532
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:18,760
But we need a fucking super genius or a
group of super geniuses are a collective

2533
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:23,480
of people to come up with a new map
for how this shit should be working.

2534
02:21:23,481 --> 02:21:24,860
You know what? I'm
starting to think, well,

2535
02:21:24,890 --> 02:21:26,510
this is what I'm starting
to think is going to happen.

2536
02:21:27,020 --> 02:21:29,630
I used to think that there's going
to be some sort of violent upheaval.

2537
02:21:29,631 --> 02:21:30,710
There's going to be real problems.

2538
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:36,200
I think that there's going to be people
on the occupied side that are far too

2539
02:21:36,201 --> 02:21:40,040
intelligent to be ignored
and that eventually they're
going to figure out some

2540
02:21:40,041 --> 02:21:42,950
vulnerabilities to the system and
then they're going to have some power,

2541
02:21:43,160 --> 02:21:44,270
and once they have some power,

2542
02:21:44,271 --> 02:21:47,030
then people are going to talk and then
they're going to have to work something

2543
02:21:47,031 --> 02:21:50,840
out and change some laws and changed some
rules because until there's some sort

2544
02:21:50,841 --> 02:21:54,020
of a threat from the other side, you know,
it doesn't have to be a violent threat.

2545
02:21:54,170 --> 02:21:57,590
It could simply be some fucking
computer geniuses who know how to rework

2546
02:21:57,591 --> 02:21:58,040
everything,

2547
02:21:58,040 --> 02:22:00,850
not a shutting down the fucking Internet
who knew how to make things and valid

2548
02:22:00,851 --> 02:22:05,050
in, in an own functional.
It could be people who know
how to manipulate, you know,

2549
02:22:05,150 --> 02:22:07,940
money through through the Internet.
Who the fuck knows,

2550
02:22:08,410 --> 02:22:12,200
I mean it's going to be deemed a terrorist
act, whatever it is, you know, anything.

2551
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:15,440
I mean that's really what by by
the, by the Patriot Act, you know,

2552
02:22:15,441 --> 02:22:19,620
anything you're doing to
attack the government now is
like a terrorist act. Yeah,

2553
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:23,990
right. I bet me even suggesting that
someone may try to do this makes you under

2554
02:22:23,991 --> 02:22:26,010
suspicion.
You extrapolating and looking

2555
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:29,250
at history and you look into
human behavior and you're
looking at this situation

2556
02:22:29,251 --> 02:22:31,680
and knowing that it's going to
escalate. What, what could happen.

2557
02:22:31,681 --> 02:22:35,550
I think someone's gonna figure out a
way to have some power, the occupiers,

2558
02:22:35,700 --> 02:22:38,610
but saying that by saying that
it's almost like I'm cheerleading,

2559
02:22:38,790 --> 02:22:42,210
I could become an enemy by saying
that. Which is amazing. You've,

2560
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:46,380
I'd say you're a little, this was Orwell
Orwellian. It really is. I mean it's,

2561
02:22:46,530 --> 02:22:51,530
it's amazing that life is now more fucked
up than fix fucking people come at,

2562
02:22:51,661 --> 02:22:54,040
you know like the people who like are
looking under their car because they are

2563
02:22:54,041 --> 02:22:56,850
tight. They got a flat tire and like,
Hey, what's that fucking box there?

2564
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:00,210
And they pull the box out from under
their car and it's still kind of magnetic

2565
02:23:00,211 --> 02:23:03,840
bug. Some people stuck on their car
in the middle of the night tracking,

2566
02:23:05,070 --> 02:23:08,200
then they come and collect it. You know,
like that guy who popped it at school.

2567
02:23:08,210 --> 02:23:10,320
And how about this carrier Iq?
Should Brian,

2568
02:23:10,321 --> 02:23:13,200
you just send me an update on this
carrier Iq. What was the update again?

2569
02:23:13,590 --> 02:23:17,460
When they say that the FBI
will not release any records
on this carrier? Iq Shit.

2570
02:23:17,580 --> 02:23:20,810
Yeah, they won't comment on
it. I mean like the, the, the,

2571
02:23:20,811 --> 02:23:23,420
the guys that from the company or there,
you know,

2572
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:28,200
talking saying that they've never
given it their information to the FBI,

2573
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:30,630
but the FBI will not comment whatsoever.

2574
02:23:30,631 --> 02:23:33,990
And the refuse a freedom of
information act requests. Yeah. Right.

2575
02:23:33,991 --> 02:23:36,510
Because it's an ongoing investigation.
That's what they're saying.

2576
02:23:36,511 --> 02:23:40,430
Don't have to have fucking power.
There's so much power, so much power.

2577
02:23:41,670 --> 02:23:42,210
And you know,

2578
02:23:42,210 --> 02:23:45,120
the best way to abuse power is to say
that we're doing it for your own good.

2579
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:47,100
We're doing it for your own
good. You trust us. Listen,

2580
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:50,340
we need this power in order to,
to get the bad people.

2581
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:53,880
We know you're a good person. Trust
us. We just need this little provision.

2582
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:57,450
What's a terrorist? Exactly. Oh,
some guy who sells 20 joints.

2583
02:23:57,451 --> 02:24:00,660
Newt Gingrich is a 200 joints.
Oh 200 doses.

2584
02:24:00,661 --> 02:24:01,980
He's a terrorist and he
should be put to death.

2585
02:24:02,210 --> 02:24:06,810
Someone who grows plants or the
fuck's that want to run our world.

2586
02:24:06,811 --> 02:24:10,110
Man. Really? That's what
we need. That Ron Paul Guy,

2587
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:12,620
even though he doesn't
believe in evolution, I've
heard some, the problem with,

2588
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:13,460
I mean I don't,

2589
02:24:13,460 --> 02:24:16,770
I talked about this in the lavender hour
about Ron Paul and we got some people

2590
02:24:16,771 --> 02:24:20,790
riding in there like shit that I didn't
investigate fully. I, like I said,

2591
02:24:20,791 --> 02:24:23,980
I like what didn't you invest it as
issues? Something about a Hollywood,

2592
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,070
get rid of the highway
systems or something.

2593
02:24:26,071 --> 02:24:30,360
Like he doesn't want to support like,
um, he wants to go back to buggies. No,

2594
02:24:30,361 --> 02:24:33,000
it's not bad.
In fact of Huggies horse running.

2595
02:24:33,060 --> 02:24:34,830
He wants to go back to know
it's some kind of thing.

2596
02:24:34,831 --> 02:24:38,210
There was a few things that
were um, a little, uh, the,

2597
02:24:38,220 --> 02:24:43,220
I didn't know that because I really
love the guy and doesn't need to be more

2598
02:24:43,321 --> 02:24:47,490
specific. I meant to go and
invest. And it's something
that you don't remember. No,

2599
02:24:47,491 --> 02:24:51,600
I remember they said Ron Paul, we get
somehow get rid of the interstate system.

2600
02:24:51,810 --> 02:24:55,650
Ron Paul interstate system. I couldn't
find it. You couldn't? I don't,

2601
02:24:55,890 --> 02:24:57,010
I don't think so.
Just,

2602
02:24:57,100 --> 02:25:00,540
and then also the evolution thing came
from the commerce clause. Is that it?

2603
02:25:00,570 --> 02:25:02,610
I don't, I don't know. That's
something different I think,

2604
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:06,600
but I love him right now. I
still like him, so I don't know.

2605
02:25:07,530 --> 02:25:09,090
I'm sure there's some
weird shit about him.

2606
02:25:09,091 --> 02:25:11,850
I guess if he doesn't believe in
evolution, that is fucked up, man.

2607
02:25:11,851 --> 02:25:15,870
That's maybe you've had a
religious experience. Maybe
ate some bad bread one day.

2608
02:25:16,410 --> 02:25:17,380
Trip the fuck out.

2609
02:25:18,060 --> 02:25:21,850
It's got an insight to people who believe
the earth is 5,000 years old or that

2610
02:25:21,860 --> 02:25:24,080
some of the funniest fucking people ask.
There's a,

2611
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:26,650
there's a big move for Ron Paul right now.
Man.

2612
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:30,700
He's moving with this occupy Wall Street
thing. Ron Paul is fucking exploding.

2613
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:34,390
Ron Paul is neck and neck with Newt
Gingrich right now in the Iowa poll.

2614
02:25:34,660 --> 02:25:38,080
That is unprecedented people,
people, they're not expecting this.

2615
02:25:38,110 --> 02:25:40,720
Did you hear all these other
guys are falling apart?

2616
02:25:40,750 --> 02:25:43,000
That's the crazy thing about
these dummy republicans.

2617
02:25:43,210 --> 02:25:46,630
All of them slowly but surely
are showing that they're morons.

2618
02:25:46,750 --> 02:25:49,120
First it was Herman.
Cain is fucked. Everyone.

2619
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:52,840
And then it's Rick Perry who can't
remember anything and then it's, you know,

2620
02:25:52,841 --> 02:25:56,770
it's fucking Mitt Romney. He's got
way too much money. Rick Perry, Shit,

2621
02:25:56,771 --> 02:26:01,230
fucking Internet video about
celebrate craisins but,

2622
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:04,480
but you know, we know the
gays want to get buried. Yeah,

2623
02:26:04,481 --> 02:26:09,070
we can put gays in the military. K's in
the military. We celebrate Christmas.

2624
02:26:09,190 --> 02:26:12,100
Meanwhile, he's wearing the same
jacket from Brokeback mountain.

2625
02:26:12,370 --> 02:26:15,670
He's wearing the same jacket that
heath ledger war in Brokeback mountain.

2626
02:26:15,910 --> 02:26:19,450
You almost wonder if his stylist has
a sense of humor, you know? I mean,

2627
02:26:19,451 --> 02:26:21,190
how brilliant would that
be if they're like, well,

2628
02:26:21,191 --> 02:26:23,530
we got to make you look
like a good old boy. I mean,

2629
02:26:23,531 --> 02:26:25,600
you're just like George Bush again.
You're reincarnate.

2630
02:26:25,620 --> 02:26:28,030
Lot of people love George Bush. He
was a good man. It's good president.

2631
02:26:28,180 --> 02:26:31,270
We want to get you dressing like a
rancher. Which a ranch. Okay, we'll,

2632
02:26:31,271 --> 02:26:36,160
we'll dress him like a rancher. Rancher.
Rancher. Gas Line. Well, you know,

2633
02:26:36,161 --> 02:26:40,960
we know ranchers like, Oh,
you know American strong.
Okay. Yeah. Like Heath Ledger.

2634
02:26:41,270 --> 02:26:46,060
Yeah. Give him the fucking same jacket,
but come on man. What are the odds?

2635
02:26:46,180 --> 02:26:49,630
Who the fuck has a tan jacket
with a brown, a dark brown color?

2636
02:26:49,660 --> 02:26:53,010
Get the fuck Outta here. He's winking
at you and somebody who's waking

2637
02:26:55,900 --> 02:26:57,760
someone.
Someone behind the scenes.

2638
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:02,320
That's a one on 99% are and then
don't like it. Don't like it.

2639
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:05,630
It's a whistle blower.
Yeah, man, there's that.

2640
02:27:05,650 --> 02:27:07,780
There's definitely like
little clues out there.

2641
02:27:08,170 --> 02:27:10,060
He's Desperado and what it is now,

2642
02:27:10,061 --> 02:27:12,220
it's like one of those shows
where it's about to get canceled.

2643
02:27:12,221 --> 02:27:16,900
So they bring in a black character. We
need a nutty neighbor and he's a rapper,

2644
02:27:16,901 --> 02:27:19,780
you know, or you know, whatever.
They're just panicking right now.

2645
02:27:19,781 --> 02:27:21,820
This is a death spiral,
but they're all like,

2646
02:27:21,850 --> 02:27:24,040
all of them seem like they
should be on Jerry Springer.

2647
02:27:24,041 --> 02:27:25,600
They don't seem like they
should be running for president.

2648
02:27:25,601 --> 02:27:29,050
I seem like just freaks and,
well Newt Gingrich's clown,

2649
02:27:29,110 --> 02:27:32,860
guilty of ethics violations and you
know he was accused of over 40 different

2650
02:27:32,861 --> 02:27:37,300
ethics violations and serves divorce
papers to his wife dying of cancer.

2651
02:27:37,330 --> 02:27:40,390
There's just so much that I don't
like about him and one time, this is,

2652
02:27:40,810 --> 02:27:43,690
by the way, this is the one thing
that really sticks in my mind.

2653
02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:46,810
Think about this nude because this really
sticks in my mind as to who you really

2654
02:27:46,811 --> 02:27:47,560
are.

2655
02:27:47,560 --> 02:27:52,560
There was a kid the in one of those
MTV shows that came up to him and said

2656
02:27:52,780 --> 02:27:57,370
boxers or briefs and instead of
having any sort of a sense of humor,

2657
02:27:57,520 --> 02:27:57,911
he's like,

2658
02:27:57,911 --> 02:28:01,240
dad is a stupid question and I'm not
going to answer your stupid quite like the

2659
02:28:01,241 --> 02:28:04,600
way set it like demeaning to the kid,
like an authority to fix.

2660
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:07,840
The kid should have said bitch and
just cracked him right in the face.

2661
02:28:07,841 --> 02:28:11,230
Like you wouldn't have
jungle you old rotten Bruna,

2662
02:28:11,550 --> 02:28:16,270
old rotten tomato sitting on a fucking
window sill. Yeah, rotting in the sun.

2663
02:28:16,850 --> 02:28:19,450
Getting fresh with stupid.
It's a stupid question. Yeah.

2664
02:28:19,451 --> 02:28:22,010
We're joking around as a TV show.
This is MTV

2665
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:25,910
dummy. You know what does the way you an
asshole, you know guy comes up to you,

2666
02:28:25,911 --> 02:28:29,600
he's asking you questions about all kinds
of legitimate shit and he said, sir,

2667
02:28:29,630 --> 02:28:33,020
one question,
boxers or briefs and you get angry at him.

2668
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:34,790
You get angry at him because
he threw that in there.

2669
02:28:34,791 --> 02:28:37,760
What kind of a nice caring you.
You're agreeing to do an interview,

2670
02:28:37,761 --> 02:28:40,550
but you don't like the underwear question.
That's frivolous.

2671
02:28:40,551 --> 02:28:44,660
Soon as time of if seriousness,
fuck you. Fuck you.

2672
02:28:44,661 --> 02:28:49,520
You creepy withered Turd. You'll creepy
dude. It's your last chance to be king.

2673
02:28:49,700 --> 02:28:53,990
It ain't going to work, dude. Often you're
getting exposed and you're exposed now,

2674
02:28:53,991 --> 02:28:57,650
but they're going to hack away at you
slowly but surely hack away at all the

2675
02:28:57,651 --> 02:29:01,850
different times that you
use your influence to make
money hacking away at all

2676
02:29:01,851 --> 02:29:04,250
the different times you force things
through that other people weren't

2677
02:29:04,251 --> 02:29:07,490
comfortable. Yeah, they've got,
this is the thing about Obama, man,

2678
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:10,700
that I think about Obama,
whether or not you like him or not,

2679
02:29:10,850 --> 02:29:13,700
I think that guy's a pretty,
a pretty dangerous,

2680
02:29:13,701 --> 02:29:17,840
vicious guy and I think he uses like a
lot of tricks that the fact that he's not

2681
02:29:17,841 --> 02:29:21,650
vetoing this act, this act would
put him at odds with Congress,

2682
02:29:21,651 --> 02:29:24,350
put him at odds with the Senate and he's
not going to be to not fucking vetoing

2683
02:29:24,351 --> 02:29:26,900
it. It's amazing. And he said
he would veto to veto it.

2684
02:29:26,930 --> 02:29:30,880
He's not going to be taught. It's amazing
where we, this is, it's going to go down.

2685
02:29:31,180 --> 02:29:33,200
Yes, I did a piss. Yeah, they've
said he's going to sign it.

2686
02:29:33,290 --> 02:29:35,360
Let's just wrap this pitch up and I'll
send this thing. It's fucking him.

2687
02:29:35,361 --> 02:29:38,780
Three hours long. Thanks
everybody. Thanks for tuning in.

2688
02:29:38,960 --> 02:29:42,930
Thank you to the fleshlight for.
Thank you for that.

2689
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:44,970
Thank you flashlight for
so many wonderful memory.

2690
02:29:44,990 --> 02:29:46,340
Thank you for being so awesome.

2691
02:29:46,490 --> 02:29:51,260
Thank you for every time I've gone
like this inside of your body. Ah.

2692
02:29:51,650 --> 02:29:53,570
Can I talk about a show? I'm
doing? Sure. Yeah, please do.

2693
02:29:53,630 --> 02:29:58,630
I'm going to be at Caroline's
and New York City tomorrow,

2694
02:29:58,940 --> 02:29:58,970
Friday and Saturday.

2695
02:29:58,970 --> 02:30:03,590
I'm featuring for Natasha Leggiero as
they come out to Caroline's is the shit.

2696
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:07,100
That's a great point. That's a fun place
to be, man. Caroline's in New York City.

2697
02:30:07,101 --> 02:30:10,940
You can't get any better than that. Come
that's on Broadway. Yeah, come, come.

2698
02:30:10,941 --> 02:30:13,070
It's a hilarious show.
Um, but we were also,

2699
02:30:13,071 --> 02:30:16,640
Dunkin and I will be performing together
on New Year's Eve at the Melrose Improv.

2700
02:30:16,641 --> 02:30:21,440
Holla at your boy. Me, Dunkin
and Joey motherfucking Diaz.

2701
02:30:22,370 --> 02:30:26,420
P S suck it. Okay. We don't know
a thing. There's only one show.

2702
02:30:26,450 --> 02:30:28,400
That's the right way to do it.
We might have two shows,

2703
02:30:28,670 --> 02:30:31,310
in which case the eight o'clock people
don't get to celebrate the mystical

2704
02:30:31,460 --> 02:30:34,940
changing of the guard. That's right.
She was a flux. We'll fake it.

2705
02:30:34,941 --> 02:30:39,680
We'll do a count down that way you'll
celebrate it twice, right word. Um,

2706
02:30:39,980 --> 02:30:44,980
also we were at the Chicago Theater
January 27th and it is almost sold out.

2707
02:30:45,681 --> 02:30:46,431
If it sells out.

2708
02:30:46,431 --> 02:30:49,760
Apparently they're going to open up
some other sections like this upper high

2709
02:30:49,761 --> 02:30:53,270
balcony, but the tickets you want
to probably the ones that are,

2710
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:56,760
well actually it's fucking old badass
theater when it was tiered theory man,

2711
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:59,570
that'd be awesome if you have
the top balcony. Um, but uh,

2712
02:30:59,571 --> 02:31:03,800
it's me and Dunkin and Joey Diaz as well.
Or should I say donkey, Joey Diaz and I,

2713
02:31:04,190 --> 02:31:07,490
because that's the correct way
Curtis and letting people know,

2714
02:31:07,580 --> 02:31:10,010
that's why you say that
the toy structured, because
I'm thinking of you first.

2715
02:31:10,390 --> 02:31:14,420
That's what people like. Okay, so learn
from that all you dirty bitches. Oh,

2716
02:31:14,421 --> 02:31:18,890
you fucked up evil selfish fucks. Who
are not looking out for your fellow man.

2717
02:31:18,990 --> 02:31:23,880
Look out for your fellow man and only
hang around people who are 100% looking

2718
02:31:23,881 --> 02:31:28,470
out for you too. This is possible. This
can be done. Okay. I have proven it.

2719
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:29,610
You can do the same thing.

2720
02:31:29,611 --> 02:31:33,810
You can manifest your own reality
and make it so Dogen. God is love.

2721
02:31:34,050 --> 02:31:36,600
Gets him Jizan Jesus and holes.
Guys,

2722
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:40,110
let's end this with a chance.
Can you give us a chance to,

2723
02:31:40,111 --> 02:31:42,840
and this will say real
quick, that were, oh yeah,

2724

The annex in the Ice House.
It's a small room.

It's only 85 seats and it our
star studded shows. And uh,

2733
02:32:14,201 --> 02:32:18,000
So was house comedy done? The Ice
House is the shit. It's a great club.

2734
02:32:18,001 --> 02:32:22,010
It's got a great vibe. It's where
we do most of the podcasts from. Uh,

2735
02:32:22,090 --> 02:32:24,610
we were doing a lot of them from there
lately. This one we're doing for my,

2736
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:25,501
my office,

2737
02:32:25,501 --> 02:32:30,060
but most of them we do at the ice house
cause it's such a cool group of people

2738
02:32:30,061 --> 02:32:32,160
that work there and it's a good vibe.

2739
02:32:32,161 --> 02:32:35,340
And the club has been around for like
over 50 years. Right. And isn't it like,

2741
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:42,990

the walls man. It's like a real spot.

2742
02:32:43,230 --> 02:32:43,771
