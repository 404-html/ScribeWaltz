1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,070
Hey everybody.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,280
What the fuck is going on.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,610
This is one of the very last versions
of the Joe Rogan questions everything

4
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:14,640
podcasts that we're releasing
as an actual podcast.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,810
We did somewhere around 10 of
them and I think we have two left.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,880
So probably this one and one other one
might not have been 10 but don't get all

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,224
specific.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,610
Ladies and gentlemen this show
was really a pleasure to do the.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,880
The big pleasure of it was working with
my buddy Duncan of course and exposing

10
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:39,720
him to millions of people worldwide who
didn't didn't know about my brilliant

11
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:44,721
friend and one of things I really love
about doing podcast with Duncan is he

12
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:51,291
really gets me inspired to go on these
wild rants and I think I inspire him in

13
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:56,190
the same way and we have this really cool
give and take energy when it comes to

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,170
certain things and he was just
absolutely brilliant on the show and in

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,770
introducing subjects and talking to
people and injecting new ideas into these

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,340
silly subjects like psychics which is
this this episode and a huge thank you to

17
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,770
Benishek who was the guy who
we interviewed during the
show and had him put on a

18
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:26,061
little bit of a demonstration that really
opened up my mind to what is possible

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,260
in the world of trickery and manipulation
and sleight of hand the art thereof of

20
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:31,680
it.

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,940
I mean I'd always known that there was
a real art to magic but boy did that guy

22
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:36,774
blow my mind.

23
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,720
And what are the things I
really appreciated about
battered check was that he

24
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:42,240
blew my mind and then he
told me it was all bullshit.

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,140
He didn't try to pretend that he had
some magic power or some device that only

26
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,220
the government knows about
hidden horseshit you.

27
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,990
He told you after he was doing that.

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,410
And even during the time he was doing it
that it was all bullshit but he was so

29
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:58,590
good at it it was still
unbelievably fascinating.

30
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,130
I hope this also opens up a
lot of people's eyes as to
what is possible in terms

31
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:09,810
of trickery in terms of what someone
can what someone can trick you into

32
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:14,811
believing and what kind of manipulation
people can pull off when they pretend to

33
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:17,130
have psychic abilities.

34
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,110
There's a lot of that going on folks.

35
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,150
There's I mean there very well may be
some sort of a psychic energy that people

36
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:31,551
possess whether it's a sense that people
are not aware of or smells that people

37
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:36,740
can detect that they can't quite describe
that aren't quite olfactory but to

38
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,940
some sense of something being wrong.

39
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,330
But there's also a lot
of liars out there man.

40
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,550
There's a lot of fakers and
there's a lot of bullshit.

41
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,500
And one of the things that I was most
proud about the sci fi show was that we

42
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:54,501
were able to expose some of that bullshit
and whether it was bullshit about the

43
00:02:55,591 --> 00:03:00,591
science behind chem trails or whether
it was the evidence in quotes when it

44
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:06,291
comes to UFOs or whether it was not
bullshit like the that the technical and

45
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,460
technological innovation that's going
on at this incredibly rapid rate that

46
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:13,770
we're experiencing and where
this all could lead to.

47
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,830
You know it was one of my favorite
parts about the show in fact.

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,720
One of the least controversial
and most real aspects of the show.

49
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,750
But ultimately it was a lot of fun to do.

50
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,490
And so thank you to Duncan Trussell
and Duncan has an amazing podcast that

51
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,670
Duncan Trussell family hour.

52
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,610
He's an amazing standup comedian.

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,440
He's just one of my favorite
human beings on the planet.

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,280
He and Chris Ryan who is the author of
Sex at Dawn and me are doing a joint

55
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,920
podcast once a month.

56
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,210
We just did Duncans really recently that
Duncan Trussell family our and we doing

57
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:52,170
Chris Ryan's podcast podcast
which is tangentially speaking.

58
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,220
And then I will do mine again and we'll
just keep rotating once a month we'll do

59
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:56,730
each other.

60
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,340
But just awesome to have
those guys as friends.

61
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,080
Awesome to be able to do this show with
Duncan and awesome to be able to work

62
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:09,081
with such awesome guys like Tom Mesereau
who is the executive producer and and

63
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,310
Frank and Michael from Arthur Smith and
just we had a great time and all the

64
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:17,790
people at Sci fi Tim and Wayne
and everyone thank you very much.

65
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,030
We really really enjoyed working with
you guys and I really appreciate the

66
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:26,031
opportunity and I really appreciate you
letting me release these podcasts that

67
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:27,220
we recorded on the show.

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,700
A lot of people thought they were
like we were faking podcasts they were

69
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:33,420
actually real podcasts and allegedly
there was real marijuana involved.

70
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,870
Anyway this is one of the last ones and
this one is brought to you by Ting Ting

71
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:43,260
is a cell phone service that
utilizes the sprint backbone.

72
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,120
It's one of my favorite all time podcast
sponsors because I have had nothing but

73
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:53,121
positive feedback from Ting Ting is the
cell phone service if you've heard us

74
00:04:56,371 --> 00:05:01,371
talk about it before that uses Top End
and phones and what they do is they rent

75
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:07,121
space off of the off the sprint backbone
so they do it on their terms like they

76
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:11,000
don't have any contracts they don't have
any early termination fees they don't

77
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:15,920
have all the nonsense that a lot of
people have that's attached to his cell

78
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:20,921
phone service it's like hidden fees and
overages with Tang you only pay for what

79
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,310
you use if you go over your allotted
minutes you just pay for what you use is

80
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:29,930
not some exorbitant rate that you have
to pay for it's not some some go fuck

81
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:34,130
yourself nonsense that comes along because
that's that's a real problem with a

82
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:39,131
lot of these companies that are selling
cell phone services that they're greedy

83
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,920
they don't just want a little bit they
want it all they want to suck you dry and

84
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:50,090
get out of you whatever they can get out
of you What team does is they sell you

85
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,150
the very best of all of the Android phones
like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 which

86
00:05:56,871 --> 00:06:01,871
is what I use or they use the the Galaxy
S4 which is another suite phone the HTC

87
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:09,770
One there's a bunch of these really bad
ass Android phones and they do it in a

88
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:14,771
way where you are going to save money
guaranteed you're going to save it because

89
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:20,621
98 percent of people 98 percent people
would save money would tank if you're one

90
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:25,460
of those 2 percent MAN YOU NEED TO LOOK
AT YOURSELF WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU DUDE

91
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,450
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU MAN.

92
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,040
Why are you saving money.

93
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,730
Hmm hmm hmm hmm.

94
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,100
Are you a crazy with
how you use your phone.

95
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,533
What's wrong man.

96
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,580
What is wrong with you.

97
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,103
Most people save.

98
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,330
I know Chris Ryan uses it.

99
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,193
He saves.

100
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,153
I know.

101
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,270
It's just it's all in all a
better way to do business.

102
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,770
And again no contracts.

103
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,030
If you want to leave you just leave.

104
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,100
You have to deal with
any fucking nonsense.

105
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,350
You don't have to deal with any of the
bullshit that you deal with a regular

106
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:00,370
cell phone networks.

107
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,520
And again you use really
awesome cell phones.

108
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,893
So

109
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,863
what is that.

110
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,800
You are hell.

111
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,633
I can't find it.

112
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,420
I got updated copied.

113
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,010
They want me to say some
things not broken is it.

114
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,130
You know why do I feel
like it's different.

115
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,730
I just wanna make sure it's okay.

116
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,650
Hold on folks.

117
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,150
This is not much of an advertising here.

118
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,800
Rogan Dr. income

119
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,953
is that it.

120
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,740
Yes.

121
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,290
Okay.

122
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,340
Go to Rogan debt to income and you'll
save twenty five dollars off any of their

123
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:35,090
new Android phones a device.

124
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,580
I couldn't recommend them enough.

125
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,600
They're an ethical company and they're a
company that's trying to do what I wish

126
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,630
all companies would do.

127
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,430
What I wish all companies would do was
try to make money but don't try to make

128
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,480
all the fucking money.

129
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:51,010
I mean isn't it possible that you can
you know make a little bit less money and

130
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:52,510
not have people fucking pissed off at you.

131
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,140
So go to Rogan DOT team dot com
and enjoy their mobile company.

132
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,033

133
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,260
It's a no bullshit mobile service.

134
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,101
They say B.S.

135
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:05,940

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,403

139
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,980
And they have online support

Ash were also brought to you by hove or
hove or is it's actually hover hover as

143
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:31,890
a domain name company that I use myself.

144
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,310
Hover hover while I call it
hover I'm fucking asshole.

145
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,280
That's why I've been using
hover for over a year now.

146
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,430
I've registered several domains with
Hover it's super easy to do and hover has

147
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:48,400
it set up where you get things for free
like who is domain name services hover

148
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:51,570
is actually owned by the same people
that own tanks so the same ethics sort of

149
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:55,320
applies to hover that applies to tank
trying to give you a good service at a

150
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:58,530
reasonable rate where you could feel good
about the transaction and that really

151
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:02,160
should be what business is all about
they should give you something where you

152
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:06,450
pay for it what you feel like it's worth
and then you get the bill at the end of

153
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:06,900
the month.

154
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,210
Oh well that was worth that
and that that's possible.

155
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,320
OK it can be like that and you don't
get that with early termination fees and

156
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:14,790
all that shit.

157
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,960
They're taking advantage of you.

158
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,970
Fucking man hover gives you exactly what
you need to get the job done you find

159
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:25,971

to live so you can get started on it and

160
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:29,190
move on to the next
thing on your to do list.

161
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,570
Know why they even have a copy.

162
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,093
Don't tell me what to do.

163
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,880
I know about my to do list you fucks but
if you're looking for the great place

164
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:39,990
the best place for a domain
geeks developers designers
and programs are always

165
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:42,240
talking about hover and
even people like me.

166
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:47,590
I guess somebody's a geek very uneducated
geek but Harvard gives you easy to use

167
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:53,070
powerful tools tools to manage your
domain and they also make it very easy to

168
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,650
import your domain over to hover.

169
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,720
They they actually called a valet transfer
the people that hover are experts at

170
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:02,430
domain so you don't have to be.

171
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,060
They just want to take all the friction
out of managing your domains and they

172
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:08,430
want you to be able to
manage them all in one place.

173
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,350
So they offer you a valet transfer
service to make it as easy as possible to

174

outstanding customer support because

impossible to get a hold of if you ever

180
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:35,160

Don't go fuck yourself I don't really
mean that I say that shit but I'm just

209
00:11:59,151 --> 00:11:59,984
trying to be silly.

210
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,220
I'm just trying to give you a little
levity before you delve into the world of

211
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:05,150
fake psychics.

212
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,400
So with that without any further ado
thank you very much for tuning into the

213
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:11,120
podcast.

And if not for all the information that
a lot of you tweet to me and send me on

218
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:27,650
Facebook and things people tell me about
when I meet them I mean we are in a

219
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:32,300
very strange time ladies and gentlemen
and we are sharing information and I am

220
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:36,350
merely a conduit to do to distribute
some of that information your way.

221
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,960
And I'm honored and I'm out of here.

222
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,390
So enjoy the podcast and because

223
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,130
it's will gain experience by.

224
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,740
So this podcast is about psychics

225
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,250
and maybe the lack thereof.

226
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,770
You know at a certain
point time in the show.

227
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,873
You got it.

228
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,500
I was wondering what exactly was
going on when it came to psychics.

229
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,453
I always wondered.

230
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,330
I mean I would never want to completely
discredit the possibility that someone

231
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,620
could have some extraordinary
power that I don't possess.

232
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,633
Who knows.

233
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,110
You know I mean in a
way it's been explained.

234
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,600
McKenna described communication as a form
of telepathy talking because in a way

235
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,730
you're you're making established sounds
with your mouth that are attached to a

236
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:39,050
cultural context that
we all sort of agree to.

237
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,230
And in doing so you're reading my mind.

238
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,610
I'm talking to you.

239
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,410
You know what I'm I'm
talking about a laptop.

240
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,390
I went to the store to get my laptop fixed
and the guy behind the counter was in

241
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,690
such a nice guy.

242
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,720
You were you're experiencing that with
me you know so you're sort of like

243
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,420
getting a version of my memories.

244
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,160
And so I never wanted to like
completely say oh it's all b.s.

245
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:05,720
there's no way but man as we do the show
like The more we did it at a certain

246
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:10,310
point Tom I was like how much of this is
fucking free you know how much of this

247
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:11,144
is kooky.

248
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,990
There was there were several times
we were doing the show where else.

249
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Like Paul Smith who seemed like a very
nice guy tried to get me to a remote view

250
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,800
and I had nothing screw a bunch of stuff
down on paper and he was like Just go

251
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:28,880
to with whatever is moving you know
just like there's nothing there.

252
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,680
I honestly maybe it's just me.

253
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,910
I mean I left it to me.

254
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,250
I'm like I want to see him do it because
you know he'd been doing it for more

255
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,084
than a decade.

256
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,260
He's an expert at and he's actually had
positive results with it but me trying

257
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:42,350
it.

258
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,470
They were saying that they could show me
how to do it within X amount of minutes

259
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,700
I would be doing it right.

260
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,623
Nothing I wrote.

261
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,440
I drew some stuff that I drew like a
square and I wrote the color red and

262
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:55,280
something was square with red in it but
it was I guess it was a dumb guess it

263
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:58,290
was a guest where there was a bunch
of shapes and stuff in this location.

264
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,340
So if I had to judge myself on a pass or
fail I would give myself a ninety nine

265
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,730
point nine nine percent fail.

266
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:11,140
I can't say 100 percent fail because I
did have a square that had red in it and

267
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:12,570
there was something like that.

268
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,530
It seems to me to be like
something that shows up a lot.

269
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,090
Look there's this hour on air sign
it's a rectangle that has red in it.

270
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,760
I mean it's like there's a lot
of squares with red and I'm Yeah.

271
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,340
So I think that easily
could have been nonsense.

272
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,610
So but then I talked to Ed dames
okay and he's the number one top dog.

273
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,880
If you start Google and like
people that are able to do that.

274
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,200
People that have that remote viewing
skill Ed dames name comes up like

275
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:40,034
immediately.

276
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,570
He's like the godfather of this stuff.

277
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,240
He started that Stargate program.

278
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,790
You know so he was
working on remote viewing.

279
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,530
He said they had really positive result.

280
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,480
He said he knows how to do it.

281
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,860
And he said that they found Osama bin
Laden and he actually said they found

282
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:55,670
Osama bin Laden.

283
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,610
He believes they didn't go
after him because they didn't
want to end the war yet

284
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,760
for whatever reason you know.

285
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,920
So take that for you know
the grain of salt whatever.

286
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,203
Maybe he's right.

287
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,770
But now you do take something like that
with a grain of salt like he's saying

288
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:14,300
that psychics saw Osama bin Laden
who did they call go how does that

289
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:15,380
conversation go down.

290
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,430
Hey what's that.

291
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,010
Well he's not to psychics
he's working for the CIA.

292
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,360
He's in the government.

293
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,980
He's working in the government right.

294
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,070
I mean he's he's been.

295
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,480
And he said also in this I found this
kind of interesting and kind of make

296
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:27,314
sense.

297
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,910
He said that they were trying to like
distance themselves from this program

298
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:35,990
because it's like this paranormal thing
like you're working on like psychics.

299
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,740
And he was like even if it was effective
they were like look we don't want to be

300
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:42,950
connected to that because it just
sounds too loony even if it's effective.

301
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,330
Well you know what man.

302
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,800
If you look at the history of the
various experiments the CIA have done.

303
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,290
They're not afraid of loony right they
were dumping acid into a guy's mouth and

304
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:57,410
brothels with to a windows.

305
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,030
You see the effects of LSD.

306
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,770
Once you've done that you'll do anything
for folks who don't know that story.

307
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,650
It was called the
operation midnight climax.

308
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,920
And what they did was they they
bought brothels in New York and in San

309
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:13,514
Francisco.

310
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,750
And these guys they came in to engage
in you know prostitution type activities

311
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,970
and they dosed them.

312
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,500
They dosed them with LSD.

313
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,010
Yeah.

314
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,190
And it's an amazing story because the
guys can say shit you know you're not

315
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:31,550
supposed to be in a whorehouse anyway
and you're out there and you're getting

316
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,460
dosed up with acid like Yikes Holy shit.

317
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,080
They did a lot more than that man.

318
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,360
A lot more than that they
went in a mental asylum.

319
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,800
And they doped people up so much that
they tried to rewrite their memories to

320
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:46,250
fix their their various mental disorders.

321
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,530
They wanted to see if they
could or right erase memories.

322
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,650
They're doing this to mentally
ill people in mental hospitals.

323
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,723
I'll look it up.

324
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,720
Project Monarch.

325
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,740
The whole point is the CIA is not afraid
of putting their feet and crazy river.

326
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,760
They do it all the time.

327
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,770
So I think that the idea that they there
is they stopped this thing because they

328
00:18:05,771 --> 00:18:07,120
don't want to embarrass themselves.

329
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,960
No they stopped it because it wasn't
working because let me tell you.

330
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,480
Okay but let's let's for a moment before
I stop you I just want to play devil's

331
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:14,314
advocate okay.

332
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,020
All of those things that we're
mentioning are in the past.

333
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,680
Operation midnight climax
believes in the 1950s.

334
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,350
Yeah the this remote viewing movement.

335
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:23,930
They stopped.

336
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,310
That is well.

337
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,370
Is it possible and again this is just
devil's advocate that they try things and

338
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:32,260
they don't work so they move on.

339
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,730
Is that possible.

340
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,540
Is it possible that they it's
it's just that it didn't work.

341
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,910
I mean I think that if any government
on the planet figured out a way to use a

342
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:46,360
team of elite psychics to
locate their enemies right.

343
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,970
They're not gonna be like oh let's cancel
this program it's embarrassing they're

344
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,510
gonna keep using it
because it's effective.

345
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,220
What's a better thing than you've just
set some guy in a chair and have him

346
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:02,050
communicate all over the planet with
whatever matrix of intelligence exist

347
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,620
between him and whatever.

348
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,360
Okay.

349
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,860
What if it only works every now and
then but sometimes it really does work.

350
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,530
I think there's plenty of money in the
government to keep somebody like that on

351
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:16,090
tap but maybe not man.

352
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,200
I think it does work.

353
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:22,290
I've had so many moments where I'm
thinking of a friend and they call or I'll

354
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:26,410
get a weird feeling about somebody and
something bad will happen to them and I

355
00:19:26,411 --> 00:19:29,770
know plenty of people who do that and
I know plenty of people who will get

356
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:34,070
around certain people and immediately not
be comfortable around them and they're

357
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,370
sensing something about that person.

358
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I think animals are always tuning into
this deeper instinctual level so at some

359
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:45,730
point it just becomes I think semantics.

360
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,610
Some people are gonna say well
I just listen to my instincts.

361
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,780
Some people are going to say that their
psychic so I don't think that there is a

362
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,450
it's too out there to think that
there's some people who have especially

363
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,070
developed instincts where they're really
good at tuning in to watch Sheldrake

364
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:05,140
call the more for genetic field.

365
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,420
I think that's possible
that you could do that.

366
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,530
The problem is well if you if it is
possible then how come it can't be or

367
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,420
reproduced in laboratory settings.

368
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,750
And a lot of people say that immediately
discounts it but man I I can't imagine

369
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:25,780
meeting someone who's never had that
moment where you think about someone and

370
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:28,660
suddenly they call someone that
you haven't talked to in years.

371
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,440
You know that that has happened now.

372
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,670
To play devil's advocate again Sam Harris
says that all that is is coincidental

373
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,020
and that we think about people all the
time and they don't call but occasionally

374
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:45,130
you think about people and they do call
and then it really is just dumb luck.

375
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,110
But we make it out to be
this big important moment
and we sort of discredit all

376
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:51,730
the other times where it failed.

377
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But he's like really super logical when
it comes to stuff like that to the point

378
00:20:57,191 --> 00:21:01,750
where I almost have to step back like
he said that statistically no one really

379
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:06,220
ever gets a hot hand in basketball where
they can't miss it just seems like they

380
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:06,730
do.

381
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,730
But if you count up statistically like
there's never a zone for where there's an

382
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:15,580
unusual amount of activity over a
course of an hour it's like these little

383
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:19,120
bursts where things are really good and
then they go away but it all balances

384
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:20,080
itself out in the end.

385
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,320
And I've found it found that very
fascinating cause I've always felt like

386
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,000
someone getting in the zone whether it's
in golf or in pool or in basketball or

387
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:28,360
anything.

388
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,930
I always thought that was a real thing
and some people I've seen pool players do

389
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:34,660
it when you get into a place
where you just can't miss.

390
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:40,020
And you know you just find that zone and
you're significantly better than when

391
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:41,270
you're not in that zone right.

392
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,360
So I've always felt that
it was a real thing.

393
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,950
So Sam Harris is a tricky guy when it
comes to his ideas on these things.

394
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,990
Well who knows man.

395
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,170
Maybe he hasn't experienced it himself
but maybe he has and he's analyzed it

396
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,940
more objectively than you and I am.

397
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,200
That's a possibility too.

398
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:01,290
I had a dream once where in the dream
this girl that I was engaged to be married

399
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:07,350
came up to me and said hey I'm pregnant
and in the dream I was bummed out.

400
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,550
I'm like Oh great.

401
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,560
Pregnant and then the next day I woke up
and an hour after I woke up she called

402
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,620
to tell me that she's getting married now.

403
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,430
Wow.

404
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,220
What is that.

405
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,290
Well I know that that happened to me and
I know that every night I don't dream

406
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,140
about my ex fiancee being pregnant.

407
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,650
That's not a recurring dream if
it were I would be in therapy.

408
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,350
Is she getting married
because she's pregnant.

409
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,270
No.

410
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,460
But.

411
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,620
OK well then that doesn't see that's
where I would step in as a skeptic.

412
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,500
Not necessarily.

413
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,310
I'm not really a skeptic but if I was I
would say because I kind of am sometimes

414
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,420
I would say you probably think about her
all the time I think about my exes all

415
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:47,254
the time.

416
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,790
It's like a normal part of life.

417
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,090
Yeah.

418
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,830
I don't you're you you were engaged.

419
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,580
Sure.

420
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,240
And I've vivid dreams I understand that.

421
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,360
But you were engaged to her.

422
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,140
That's a very strong connection
with someone it's very
likely that you bring her

423
00:22:58,141 --> 00:23:00,180
up in your mind on occasion.

424
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,160
I have your scenario on my stomach.

425
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,540
Your scenario is different than her
scenario your scenario is she was pregnant

426
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:09,030
her scenario the reality was
that she was getting married.

427
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,600
Well you just happen to be thinking about
her and she just happened to call you

428
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:16,050
and tell you that she's getting married
and you have made this grandiose

429
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:17,310
connection between a dream.

430
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:21,180
Well let me play the real devil's advocate
because as many Christians know the

431
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:26,181
devil is the advocate of psychics the
psychics say that what actually happens is

432
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:32,430
that your mind is kind of like scanning
and it doesn't always accurately

433
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,270
interpret the event.

434
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,460
So pregnancy and marriage that go hand
in hand and then she did end up having

435
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:39,294
children.

436
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,920
So the the point what makes it special
and by the way I don't I know what Sam

437
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:44,700
Harris is talking about.

438
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,700
They've done studies about the idea that
there's perpetually as just a vortex of

439
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,020
variables spinning through your mind that
consist of all the people you know and

440
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:58,970
all the things that could happen and those
things are mostly in the subconscious

441
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,940
but when something in the external
universe happens that resonates with

442
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,620
something in the subconscious that creates
the sense of synchronicity that you

443
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,693
say is real.

444
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,120
Yeah man I know that I don't always
dream about it I know the dream was very

445
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:16,170
vivid I know it was like really soon
after waking up to the point where when I

446
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:18,540
got off the phone I
was like What the fuck.

447
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,090
That is really weird.

448
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:26,040
So well it is like it's not outside of
the realm of possibility but all I ever

449
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:31,041
say in these situations is I try even
though I am a natural dork and my natural

450
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,730
inclination is to believe in psychics.

451
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,940
My natural inclination is to believe
in Bigfoot and aliens and UFOs and

452
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:39,540
everything.

453
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,540
But I also think that there's a benefit
in considering the completely numerical

454
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,980
scientific approach you know in looking
at how a guy like Sam Harris would look

455
00:24:49,981 --> 00:24:54,350
out and go you know what you have to
address that too why wouldn't you address

456
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:54,470
that.

457
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,970
You know we don't want to address that
because we don't want to miss out on some

458
00:24:56,971 --> 00:25:01,320
of the magic that is the world right
and we'd like to think that in in being

459
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:04,410
able to tell when things are about to
happen to you that somehow maybe that

460
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:07,260
offers you some veil of protection
that other people don't enjoy.

461
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,830
You know and sometime with its shit is
going to happen I'm not going to know not

462
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:11,720
to get on that plane.

463
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,900
You know and we would like to think that
we would like to think that I know many

464
00:25:15,901 --> 00:25:20,520
people miss planes and then the plane
crashes and they swear they knew they

465
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:21,600
shouldn't get on that plane.

466
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,910
I mean there's probably a lot of that too.

467
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,660
I would if that happened I maybe I hadn't
thought it I'd say I was going to get

468
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:30,810
on the plane maybe maybe we'd become a
part of your consciousness maybe whether

469
00:25:30,811 --> 00:25:32,430
you like it or not just enter in there.

470
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,110
Well yeah you know I like what Terence
McKenna said about people you know

471
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,690
ancient humans and hunting and how you
would have to develop the ability to

472
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:45,900
silently communicate with a group
of people that you're hunting with.

473
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,040
It would make it it would make you very
effective if as a hunter especially if

474
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:53,430
you're hunting in group situations
where you had to stalk something.

475
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:53,850
Yes.

476
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,850
So in that way I could see how there
might be a part of our brain that you can

477
00:25:59,971 --> 00:26:04,971
develop to be acutely tuned in to what
the people around you are thinking about

478
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:06,000
doing.

479
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,850
I think all sports
teams are based on that.

480
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:14,060
I think that I'm sure that people who
fight or you get in there really serious

481
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:18,570
situations will tell you that they can
really tune in to every sound you hear

482
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:22,290
that when someone's in a situation where
they have to fight or they're in a life

483
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,030
or death situation you always hear this.

484
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,360
Suddenly everything becomes very loud
they can hear everything see everything.

485
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:35,880
So I think it makes sense that there is
a deeper part of the human mind that is

486
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:40,050
more aware than the conscious
part of the mind that makes sense.

487
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,943
I don't I don't.

488
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,670
I don't know if that's what psychics
say that they're using but I think that

489
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,310
that does exist in the human mind.

490
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,690
It's also possible.

491
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:54,060
I think that there is like it's almost
like a waterfall that we sort of can poke

492
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:57,660
our heads through and then pull it back
and then we can't tune in all the time.

493
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,930
It's very ethereal it's very slippery.

494
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,320
Yeah and you get it or you don't get it
and maybe some people get it better than

495
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,213
than we do.

496
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,340
But one of the things that I have to
respectfully acknowledge is that Ed dames

497
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,240
who has done this for so
long trains people and it
was pretty clear to me that I

498
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:22,200
needed to learn it in order to really
understand it and I didn't learn it and I

499
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:23,340
certainly didn't learn it from him.

500
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,020
I mean Paul taught it to me very quickly
but it was really just for the show.

501
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,800
You know if we had spent a bunch of time
together like over several weeks and I

502
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:36,270
really like tried to do it as if I was
a prospect for one of their programs

503
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,930
maybe I could learn what the hell he
was talking about maybe it's just my

504
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:40,620
silliness.

505
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,460
Maybe there was a breakthrough to be
had that I didn't recognize it's super

506
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:45,780
possible that that's the case.

507
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,430
But you know there's all
there's part of you for sure.

508
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,790
That's always gonna be skeptical
until it's right and front of you.

509
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,540
Right.

510
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,320
And if you've experienced
it then you have it.

511
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,420
You can be skeptical about the experience
but you have to acknowledge the

512
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:00,254
experience.

513
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:00,860
Yeah.

514
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,160
No.

515
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,140
And then I went to the Rhine Institute.

516
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:03,860
Okay.

517
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,780
And this is really interesting.

518
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,590
That's the.

519
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,490
They're the place for the Scientific
Study of the paranormal center.

520
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,010
And I had a great time there.

521
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,900
Who is the guy that ran the Ryan center.

522
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,323
John Cruyff.

523
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,260
John Carruth is the guy who ran the Ryan
center and was kind enough to take us

524
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:24,254
through and show.

525
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,900
I sucked it over everything I tried to
be psychic with the numbers like can

526
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,560
picking which button to press.

527
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,830
I try to be psychic with picking winners
but in the process I screwed that up.

528
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:38,870
And but one thing I did do is they had
this this room where it's totally dark

529
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,970
and they have this meter that measures
photons and apparently you can create

530
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:49,030
some sort of light from your body some
sort of set so some sort of photon

531
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:54,850
release that can be measured and the
highest that anybody ever did it was this

532
00:28:54,851 --> 00:28:59,851
guy IRL and this guy IRL was like if he
was a character in a Will Ferrell movie

533
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:08,420
like he would be like the perfect
cohort he'd be like Will Ferrell's crazy

534
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:11,340
partner who also happens to be psychic.

535
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,980
Yeah and he was trying
to move me with his mind.

536
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,040
Ed what did I say his name was Will Earl.

537
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,390
He seems like it should be at Earl.

538
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,380
HIS NAME WAS ED Yeah.

539
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:25,790
Ed had gotten to one million on this thing
and Ed also could make you weave back

540
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:27,990
and forth.

541
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,430
He could he could like direct you with
his body and force force your body

542
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:33,360
backward and forward.

543
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,790
Or so he said he tried to do it.

544
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,870
I didn't move at all.

545
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,760
I don't know what he's
talking about but I try.

546
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,300
I let him try it but he's gotten
to a million on this photon thing.

547
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:48,110
I got to four hundred thousand which
they were very shocked by but I had a

548
00:29:48,271 --> 00:29:49,760
battery pack on my head.

549
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:54,910
I had a microphone and when I was doing
it I was stretching so mean the battery

550
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:58,740
pack we had like tape over the
light and everything like that.

551
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,160
But the bottom line is there's like a
piece of electronics in the room sure.

552
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,700
We did it again and I got even though I
got less much less than the first time I

553
00:30:07,831 --> 00:30:09,300
basically did the same stuff I was doing.

554
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,080
I was most like leaning
forward and touching my toes
like stretching and stuff.

555
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,890
And I was also trying to
breathe really hard as I was.

556
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,430
But then I thought about us
like how is that psychic.

557
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,950
What am I doing even if I can glow you
know like in a way that a human being

558
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:28,540
couldn't even perceive if you could
like hold your breath to the point we

559
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,480
fucking glow or get tense up and
scream to the point where you G.I.

560
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,530
until a spark comes out of your dick.

561
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,250
I don't know I don't know if that's
possible but either way it's not psychic.

562
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,510
I mean there was nothing I did that gave
me any inclination whatsoever that have

563
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:47,570
any psychic ability but I registered
very highly on this one silly test.

564
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,140
Yeah while I was running a battery pack.

565
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:50,490
Yeah.

566
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,750
You know it's to be the battery.

567
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,330
I mean I think who knows man.

568
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,670
I don't know call them up the next day
because he seem like an honest guy and

569
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,220
you know he was really excited about the
results I said you know what I think we

570
00:30:59,221 --> 00:30:59,920
screwed up.

571
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,130
Well I think we should have done
one without the battery pack.

572
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,940
We did it twice to see if
we could replicate it you
know but this thing is still

573
00:31:05,941 --> 00:31:10,941
on me and even though it's behind me
and we're in this when it's totally dark

574
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:14,910
room I'm still wearing a battery pack
and I'm moving around and I don't know if

575
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:16,950
Ed was doing the same
things that I was doing.

576
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,840
So even though my score on this this
thing was was higher I might have been

577
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:23,160
moving more than he was.

578
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,090
That might have been why the the light
changed in the room wearing this little

579
00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:30,900
battery pack so this wasn't really
scientific test but if you look at the

580
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:35,901
evolution of animals right and you think
about animals before eyeballs existed

581
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,590
the evolution of the eye.

582
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,830
You think about the gradual
evolution of the eye.

583
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:41,250
Yeah.

584
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:45,270
There would be certain animals that
were that mutation was happening to more

585
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,110
than other animals.

586
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,640
Yet those animals could talk and they
started reporting to other animals Hey man

587
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,580
there is stuff all around us.

588
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,030
There are things swimming.

589
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,520
I've seeing reefs right.

590
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,390
That's if that the other animals like
you are out of your mind there's this

591
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:02,970
darkness and movement that's all there is.

592
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,110
You're crazy.

593
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:09,410
So I don't think that it's an insane
idea that our senses are continuing to

594
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:12,000
expand and to evolve right.

595
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,330
And if you think about what they used to
be compared to what they are now we are

596
00:32:15,331 --> 00:32:17,410
like gods compared to what we used to be.

597
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,330
You know when we are just tiny little
lemur creatures eating each other's poop

598
00:32:21,331 --> 00:32:24,450
and running from snakes all
day that's a very good point.

599
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,480
But another point is if that is the
case and we're pretty aware of the

600
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:34,110
established state of consciousness that
exists right now without psychic ability

601
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,280
we're pretty sure that most of the time
almost everywhere you go there's no

602
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:43,281
psychic ability going on it's just
normal life but little peeps of it pop

603
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:43,980
through.

604
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,280
Yeah.

605
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,660
Every now and then almost like poking
through a membrane finding its way

606
00:32:48,661 --> 00:32:53,560
dissolving this membrane slowly but
surely with new experiences all the time.

607
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,810
But the membranes gigantic because
really what we're talking about is an

608
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:02,811
evolving ability and it takes a long
ass time for a human being to evolve an

609
00:33:03,511 --> 00:33:04,050
ability.

610
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:04,450
Right.

611
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:08,130
And you know some people though say
that it's not an evolving ability it's a

612
00:33:08,131 --> 00:33:12,870
devolving ability than we used to be
more tuned into what was happening around

613
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:12,990
us.

614
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:17,070
But then technology took the place of
that because really I don't need to be

615
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:21,690
telepathic I can send you a text through
the air I don't need to be in a panic

616
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,350
but look at birds look at birds
what they can do or look at.

617
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:26,940
Dogs.

618
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,360
Dogs.

619
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,900
I don't think that people think that
you that we used to be able to do it

620
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:31,734
though.

621
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:35,590
Well I think the idea is and
maybe it is a romantic idea.

622
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,320
But the idea is that the more tuned in
you get to nature the more tuned in you

623
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:45,321
get to the movement of things on Earth
the actual the life force on Earth.

624
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,880
Yeah and the more you begin to hear
deeper parts of yourself when things quiet

625
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:54,360
down you can eat like you
go in that floatation tank.

626
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:54,910
Yeah.

627
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,540
You know and when things really quiet
down you can hear very deep parts of

628
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:01,820
yourself that normally you
don't listen to at all.

629
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,390
Yeah.

630
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,540
So I think the idea is without all
the distractions of modern life.

631
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,170
People were more tuned into a
deeper instinct than we have now.

632
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,850
I think you're completely right.

633
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,240
I think that it's real possible that
we're inundated by too much sensory

634
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:21,701
overload and that we're not relying on
a lot of the instincts that we had to

635
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,470
rely on when we were hunter gatherers.

636
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:29,810
We're all we're doing is constantly
hunting down animals and on the prowl for

637
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:33,890
your next meal and being really in touch
with the Earth without any electrical

638
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:37,070
signals around us all the time
without any Wi-Fi without any radio.

639
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:41,300
You know I like to think that that shit
doesn't have any effect on me that I'm

640
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:42,530
not affected by Wi-Fi.

641
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,220
And that sounds like totally kooky talk.

642
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,590
Like what are you talking about man.

643
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,750
Scared a cell phone towers dude.

644
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,100
Are they zapping you.

645
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,560
I'm not saying that but what I am
saying is there is something undeniably

646
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:58,780
different about where it
feels when there's nothing.

647
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,020
If you go to a place that's in the
mountains and very peaceful and you step

648
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:07,040
outside and there's no cell phone signals
you don't I mean I guess you could

649
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:10,670
probably tune into the radio
up there but it is not much.

650
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,540
Yes it's fucking quiet as shit to you're
not getting any noise pollution not

651
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:15,750
getting city not.

652
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,090
It's a different feeling.

653
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,640
Now if that was life all the time
and without even the distractions the

654
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:27,641
electronic distractions that that world
sort of forces on you there's still some

655
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,860
who still you still have a TV still have.

656
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,000
If you were just in the woods all the
time it's a totally different feeling.

657
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:40,280
Yeah and if you're in the woods now
with a tracker who knows how to track

658
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:44,570
animals and they just start tracking
animals it would seem like they're magical

659
00:35:44,571 --> 00:35:46,640
probably in some of the
things that they could do.

660
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:51,790
Yeah it's amazing so yeah man I think
that that there is a difference.

661
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,300
I just saw this awesome visual depiction
of why five you seen that it's a

662
00:35:56,301 --> 00:36:01,301
picture of what Wi-Fi would look like if
if if we could see it in the air and we

663
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:06,290
look like it looks just like an ocean
like this rolling ocean of information

664
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,630
that we're all swimming
around in right now.

665
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,710
That's so crazy.

666
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,460
It's crazy.

667
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,340
How long is it going to be before
people forget about being psychic.

668
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,300
How long's it gonna be before you have
some sort of Verizon chip in your head

669
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,130
that allows you to tune into the Internet.

670
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,800
Not long it doesn't seem like
it's gonna be long right.

671
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,840
Not long ago within one hundred years.

672
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,570
That's gonna be reality
I think within ten years.

673
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,230
Really.

674
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:27,650
Yes.

675
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,040
Like an operation I don't know about
an operation I think within 10 years

676
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:34,940
they'll figure out a way to do it without
an operation that's going to be so

677
00:36:34,941 --> 00:36:35,450
strange.

678
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,750
And then it will be a world of psychics
and then being psychic won't seem

679
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:42,260
strange at all because everyone will have
the ability to tune in immediately to

680
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:47,270
all information on and available to
anyone on earth or that's on the Internet

681
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,920
and you know some people
going to complain about that.

682
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:53,180
Again I go through.

683
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,120
It everyone's thinking hell for lives.

684
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,970
Did you hear about the cyborg that
just got beaten up in France a cyborg.

685
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,090
Yeah a guy's got.

686
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,190
There's a guy who one of
the first ocular implants.

687
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:12,310
It's like connected to his bones it's
a video camera that films things and he

688
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:17,411
was in a McDonald's in Paris and he goes
in there the owner of the McDonald's

689
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,960
sees him tells him to take off his google
glass he throws Google glasses and I

690
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:25,100
can't I can't take it off.

691
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:29,930
He brings medical papers with him to
show people that it's an implant right.

692
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:35,120
But they didn't care and they you know
they tried to rip it off his face but

693
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:37,160
it's connected to his bones.

694
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,220
Oh my God.

695
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,990
So the thing is got now
the thing is got in it.

696
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:47,150
This if it starts malfunctioning it
starts taking pictures of what's happening

697
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:51,890
when it malfunctions so he's got images
of these French dudes who tried to rip

698
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:52,730
his face off.

699
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,780
So what happened to the he's filing
charges with the police but they don't

700
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,350
they're not.

701
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,730
I mean it's like it's so weird.

702
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,950
The cops are like look we don't
know how to handle cyborg crime.

703
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,040
Yeah.

704
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,960
Why would they say this is
gonna be an emergent form of.

705
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:11,420
This is gonna be a new kind of hate
crime which is people beating up cyborgs.

706
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,640
I think that's probably
going to be the case.

707
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:18,110
I think especially if the limbs possessed
superpowers like if you start getting

708
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:21,800
into like some six million dollar man
realm where you decide to get your legs

709
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:25,360
chopped off and put these super bionic
legs on you just jumping over buildings

710
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,380
and shirt and you know some
guys might kick your ass.

711
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,090
The MillerCoors is crazy.

712
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,953
Good luck.

713
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,140
I know you have your cyborg legs.

714
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:36,260
They'll be really hard but if they hit
you in the head you probably saw a human

715
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:39,030
head you know sucker punch
you Ryan see it coming.

716
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,840
And then when you're out it's fuck you up.

717
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,440
Well this is like another problem.

718
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,730
This is a very off topic but this is
another problem that's emerging is that

719
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:52,060
right now the disparity in wealth is
indicated through people's possessions

720
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:54,230
their cars and their
homes and their bling.

721
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,850
But in the future this disparity will be
reflected in their physical appearance

722
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,680
so poor people who can't afford cyborg
legs or cyborg arms or implants that

723
00:39:03,681 --> 00:39:08,681
allow them to tune into the Internet
they're going to have this incredible

724
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:13,130
disadvantage compared to people
who can afford the implants.

725
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,340
You know and that's that's a real problem
and you're really seeing evolution

726
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:21,170
there because those people
who can't afford it are
going to gradually slowly die

727
00:39:21,171 --> 00:39:22,004
out.

728
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:27,550
Yeah I wonder man I really wonder if
what these what we're seeing with these

729
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:32,090
people that possess this sort of psychic
energy that tune into this psychic

730
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:37,150
Genji if everyone can do it we're just
scared of even knowing that we can do it

731
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,170
so we don't look into it.

732
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,820
I mean why haven't I looked into it.

733
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,380
Why haven't I picked up a book on you
know on psychic skills like there's books

734
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:49,070
on it supposedly teach you how
to cultivate your psychic skills.

735
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,020
I haven't given them an honest try.

736
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:55,520
I haven't like sat down with them
and been been completely objective.

737
00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:00,550
So if I was making any judgment that
psychic energy wasn't real I would be I

738
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,100
would be kind of a dick
because it's not fair.

739
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,270
I really haven't tried.

740
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,050
I don't possess it but I haven't tried I
haven't tried to cultivate it I haven't

741
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:13,200
done any of the work these guys
had dames and and and Paul Smith.

742
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,330
They they have done their work
and they say they can do it.

743
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,380
So I have to take their word for it
but I think that I would like to see

744
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,900
something that really stands out for me.

745
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,750
I mean they had some good
stories about stuff that works.

746
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,020
I would like to see something really
stands out for me because the most

747
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:35,610
impressive display of psychic ability
I've ever seen in my life was self

748
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:40,611
admittedly fake a better check that was
the best display of psychic ability I

749
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:43,520
have ever seen in my life.

750
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,580
I do not know how he did it but I saw
him make forks bend without barely

751
00:40:50,011 --> 00:40:50,844
touching them.

752
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,380
I saw him make them twist up in a circle
as he was guiding them his search that

753
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:58,680
as soon as I got down to find out how
to do that and would they say well what

754
00:40:58,681 --> 00:41:01,770
you do is you take a I mean
there's a step by step guide to it.

755
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,360
Know it's possible.

756
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,020
Oh yeah.

757
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,150
You take the you take aluminum forks.

758
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,840
Right exactly like what he had.

759
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,620
And I mean this is according to the
YouTube thing I didn't spend a lot of time

760
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:17,070
with it because you have to bend but
you bend them right so you bend them and

761
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:17,904
they heat up.

762
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:22,380
So before you do your show you
spend some time on these forks.

763
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,420
They get there by bending them they heat
up they're looser and then that makes

764
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:28,350
them more bendable.

765
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,750
And I imagine that's it.

766
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:34,860
Ben this is not a if you google search
a lot of what he did there is it shows

767
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,050
how to do it on the really.

768
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:37,380
Yeah.

769
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,380
Boy I would like to see that because I
guess it's very possible I didn't really

770
00:41:42,571 --> 00:41:46,080
completely thoroughly examine those force
but I did click them together and they

771
00:41:46,081 --> 00:41:46,620
were metal.

772
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,520
Clink clink and I picked them up I looked
at them there were real forks whether

773
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:54,390
or not that was the fourth that actually
made it into his hand when he did that.

774
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,990
I don't I mean there's guys that are
really good with sleight of hand.

775
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:58,440
Yeah.

776
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,760
You know they're really good with it.

777
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,320
So that's possible but what's important
is that he says it's bullshit all right.

778
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,540
He told us that it's all tricks.

779
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,080
He said I'm not psychic I have no psychic
energy I can't tell you how I did this

780
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:13,650
because then I would reveal my
sources but I'm not psychic.

781
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,573
I believe him.

782
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,400
I mean I don't have any
reason to not believe him.

783
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,690
He seems like a very nice guy
and it was very entertaining.

784
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:26,340
He's very very talented like I felt like
we really got a treat because we got

785
00:42:26,341 --> 00:42:30,390
like a very small intimate
show with a master magician.

786
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:30,750
Yeah.

787
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,130
I mean he really is a master.

788
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:32,520
Yeah.

789
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,380
So it was really entertaining.

790
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:39,210
And then the fact that on top of that
he was telling us that it was all just

791
00:42:39,211 --> 00:42:39,900
tricks.

792
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,530
I found that to be like
really fascinating.

793
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,150
Oh yeah.

794
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,650
He's like an uber skeptic.

795
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:43,870
Yeah.

796
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:47,490
And he's showing how it's so easy to
manipulate people and he's showing how

797
00:42:47,491 --> 00:42:52,190
you've got to be very careful when you
get around somebody who tells you that

798
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,190
they can talk to dead people they can
talk to invisible people because you get

799
00:42:56,191 --> 00:42:59,160
all you get a lot of
trouble with those folks.

800
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,810
Well he fooled scientists for four years.

801
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:03,360
Yeah.

802
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,740
They thought he had real psychic
abilities for four years he fooled them.

803
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,120
Yeah it's amazing.

804
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,230
He made me much more skeptical but I'm.

805
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,440
But he still didn't.

806
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,690
You can't remove from me like experiences
I've had where it's like I don't know

807
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:23,490
what that is but it's such an incredible
coincidence that it seems beyond

808
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,450
coincidence.

809
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,160
I don't think he was
trying to remove that.

810
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:29,220
I think what he was trying to do
is it's show that you could B.S.

811
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,290
people yes you can.

812
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,140
And that's what he did.

813
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,710
He B.S.

814
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,230
people.

815
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,460
He's.

816
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,440
I don't think he's saying that you can't
have these unique moments where where

817
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,490
something becomes apparent to you.

818
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,050
I think what he was trying to do was
just show you that you can be tricked.

819
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,590
Yes.

820
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:44,650
And he was really good.

821
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,050
I mean really good at it.

822
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,220
Amazing at it.

823
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:52,460
We put coins over his eyeballs duct taped
his face and he read the serial number

824
00:43:52,531 --> 00:43:54,540
on a bill that was in my pocket.

825
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:58,920
I have no idea how he did that
he wasn't even looking at it.

826
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,480
He was looking over there.

827
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,220
Yeah.

828
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,460
That was crazy man.

829
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,950
It was crazy a lot of
what he did was crazy.

830
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,690
First of all he's 50 OK.

831
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,410
The idea that he could read
it from my hand this far away.

832
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,030
I've got it I've got it a full arm's
length away from his face that he can even

833
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:18,840
look over and read that serial number
there's little tiny print on a dollar

834
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:19,410
bill.

835
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,490
They're going to read that from there.

836
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,780
That would be really hard to do.

837
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:26,930
But with duct tape over your face or
coins over your eyeball yet and you're not

838
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:29,430
even looking at it I
don't know how he did it.

839
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,440
I don't know how he did
a lot of what he did.

840
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,310
It was amazing.

841
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:32,790
Yeah.

842
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,450
That girl when he picked her out of the
audience and told her her dog's name.

843
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,550
That girl freaked out man.

844
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,990
She was like ready to cry.

845
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,180
She got emotional you could see her face.

846
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:44,400
Her jaw was and she wasn't a plant.

847
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,240
No she wasn't.

848
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,510
You know what I didn't know though man
when I was getting all shrill of IRA

849
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,720
being a plant as I didn't know that
in the beginning it had people write

850
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:54,040
information down and
put it into an envelope.

851
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,770
Yeah but she didn't write about her dog.

852
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,710
Well I don't know that you know.

853
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,820
We know that we read her information.

854
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,400
She did write about her dog did read
the information and the crew did.

855
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,110
We had we had her information read right.

856
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,670
Yes she didn't write
a thing about her dog.

857
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,563
Well then

858
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,740
see she wrote the dogs.

859
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,560
Now women he got.

860
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,670
Did you read all that shit.

861
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,573
Yes

862
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,520
she wrote it and put it in her purse.

863
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:22,820
OK.

864
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,570
Do you know that there are pens and when
you write things down these pens they

865
00:45:26,571 --> 00:45:31,250
create an exact replica of that in a
computer program and they work wirelessly.

866
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:33,200
See I didn't know that bit of information.

867
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:36,440
So my mind was just trying to decode
what he did because it would've been

868
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:36,980
impossible.

869
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,090
Then it's like oh well we don't know
maybe she used her own pen which in case

870
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:45,650
Look man she said he named initials and
you would get that from someone writing

871
00:45:45,651 --> 00:45:47,000
their name on a thing right.

872
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:50,240
Maybe he had a camera that
was watching all of them.

873
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,690
Well I guess the point is like we're
trying to figure out the specifics of what

874
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:57,740
he did but it's no question that what
he did was tragic and it was a trick

875
00:45:57,741 --> 00:45:58,520
because that's what he said.

876
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,730
He even had a camera behind me with a
zoom lens and that's how he could read

877
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:01,970
that.

878
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,560
That's also he could
react on the audience.

879
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,550
I mean who the hell knows.

880
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,240
Yeah there's no way to how far in
advance did he know where we were going.

881
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,280
How long in advance did he know.

882
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:14,933
No idea

883
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,613
the location.

884
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,450
No idea how I got there.

885
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,970
Did he knew or know about it
beforehand though before the call.

886
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:29,823
Possibly.

887
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,970
I don't think it's

888
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:37,020
we're we're we're trying to do here folks
listening to this is trying to figure

889
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:41,640
out how the hell that guy did what
he did what he did was masterful.

890
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,050
I mean everything about it even if it was
tricks whatever it was it was amazing.

891
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,530
But having him say that it was tricks
and it was so good it makes you really

892
00:46:52,081 --> 00:46:56,160
call into question all the other
psychic ability that people claim.

893
00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:01,110
Well another thing that it does is it
shines a light on how monstrous some

894
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:06,111
people are because imagine being such a
sociopath that you use tricks like that

895
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,650
to get around people to show them that
you have powers and then you charge them

896
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:15,651
money to let them communicate with their
dead relatives your people who do that

897
00:47:15,721 --> 00:47:16,554
for a living.

898
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,800
They are the most vile monstrous people
on earth because they seek out the most

899
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:26,250
gullible humans who are desperate and
morning and full of grief and guilt and

900
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:28,320
then they do a couple banter check tricks.

901
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:31,530
They get them convinced that they are
magical and then they're like Yeah for a

902
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:36,450
thousand bucks or for a donation I'll
let you say hello to your mom again.

903
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:37,380
Yeah.

904
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,940
He was very adamant about
his his hate for that.

905
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:46,410
That type of price that minute bit of
practice and what he does he calls himself

906
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:49,530
a mentalist and he's an entertainer
and he's also a debunker.

907
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,860
He likes to debunk stuff you tell
people that what he's doing is a trick.

908
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:54,360
Yeah.

909
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,150
Just so you know he's so good at it
and he's telling you it's a trick.

910
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,780
So be careful because other people were
probably tricking you too but they're

911
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:02,970
not going to be as ethical as he is.

912
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:03,230
All right.

913
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,220
He's a really cool guy man.

914
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,240
That was a real privilege
it having him on the show.

915
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:12,290
But it is fun to imagine that he's just
an evil Talib he's just an awesome real

916
00:48:12,361 --> 00:48:15,700
psychic and that's how he makes a
living by pretending he's not he's not.

917
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,930
He just goes there because he knows
that if he tells people that being a

918
00:48:18,931 --> 00:48:23,500
telepath is possible then everyone will
have telepathic abilities and he'll he

919
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,990
won't you won't be special anymore.

920
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:29,850
I wonder if he used his own pen if he
made them write their stuff down with his

921
00:48:29,851 --> 00:48:30,510
pen.

922
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,560
That would explain a lot.

923
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:32,370
We don't.

924
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,100
I do know that they can do that now.

925
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:37,770
They have these special pens his
computer pens and they dictate.

926
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:39,390
Well we don't know.

927
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,740
We got to get your pen back.

928
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,560
I mean I know you don't know
you can do it wirelessly.

929
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:48,390
No but if you have like a I'm saying
you want to get your magic wireless pen

930
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:48,720
back.

931
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,120
You don't want it true sir but I.

932
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,220
But I think that they gave their pen
back anyway and people don't steal pens

933
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:56,280
when you fill out a rhyme especially if
you say can I have my pen back please.

934
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:59,670
Like if the magic Pentagon to ask Can I
have that blinking pen back that I gave

935
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,180
the lower the numbers says
only megabytes are left.

936
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:04,973
Yeah.

937
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:09,240
I don't know what these tricks were
but the important thing is that he says

938
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:10,010
there were tricks.

939
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:10,490
Yes.

940
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,323
And they were amazing.

941
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:15,360
Yeah but just because someone can emulate
something doesn't mean that it's not

942
00:49:15,361 --> 00:49:15,990
real.

943
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:20,990
But it made going to the Rhine Research
Center feel so silly you know like me

944
00:49:21,031 --> 00:49:23,670
standing in front of these things trying
to figure out which one's gonna go off

945
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:26,040
next and totally getting nothing right.

946
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,790
Like thinking like maybe
I've got this power.

947
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:31,500
And then this guy comes along that
shows you like the craziest psychic shit

948
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:32,590
you've ever seen in your life.

949
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,710
And then just goes oh by
the way it's all lies.

950
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,650
Yeah it's true man.

951
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,780
I mean there's a you can do a lot.

952
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:44,490
You could do a lot like think of Rasputin
think of like grass butin this dirty

953
00:49:44,491 --> 00:49:47,790
filthy guy who just comes
into Russia says that he's a.

954
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:52,800
Psychic or a mystic and the next thing
you know he's basically running Russia by

955
00:49:52,801 --> 00:49:56,790
manipulating the leaders because he's
convinced them that he has these powers.

956
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:01,080
I mean you can go far if you can
convince people even something out about

957
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:06,081
Rasputin his giant cock his giant cock
his cock that was so giant that cut it

958
00:50:06,241 --> 00:50:07,380
off and bottled it.

959
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:08,850
They saved it forever.

960
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,740
You know a jar of formaldehyde.

961
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,170
And people go to a museum
in Russia and look at it.

962
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:13,560
Yeah.

963
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,530
That's a Vegas caucus.

964
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,040
I've seen that just like
eleven inches flaccid.

965
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:17,790
Yeah.

966
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:18,750
It's a giant hog.

967
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,110
It's a terrible thing to
terrible evil looking dick.

968
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,093
Yeah it is.

969
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,310
Imagine going into a woman that you
once loved just plunging into her.

970
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,230
I think that when the apocalypse happens
it's going to wake up and break out of

971
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:32,064
that jar.

972
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,080
It's going to come out.

973
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,970
Is he taking his digs into sprout
legs in the middle of the night.

974
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:36,460
No.

975
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,700
Remember that scene in aliens.

976
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:39,660
The second one.

977
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:40,733
Where.

978
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:41,820
What's his face.

979
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,650
Mad About You kept

980
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:48,780
the chick in the in the lab tried to
get her contaminated with one of those

981
00:50:48,781 --> 00:50:49,614
little face huggers.

982
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,820
It would be like it'd
be like the face hugger.

983
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:55,830
It's going to grow some legs and Kravitz
way around the laboratory till it

984
00:50:55,831 --> 00:50:59,550
shoves its giant pickled
cock in your mouth.

985
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,950
Giant giant pickled wizard.

986
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,240
Hundreds of years of formaldehyde soaked
in this terrible green pulsating zombie

987
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:13,290
Dick with crab legs and antique jizz
remnants pile and that's where it starts.

988
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:18,500
They open up the vault to try to rescue
and you know it's a fucking swarm like a

989
00:51:19,021 --> 00:51:23,060
beehive of bugs flying through the air
that are all miniature little little

990
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:28,070
giant flying crab cocks and they just
it just spreads it spreads like like a

991
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:30,480
like a virus aerial.

992
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,850
That would be the funniest apocalypse.

993
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,330
They're looking at it on a slide for
the first time and it's a little tiny.

994
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:40,200
Evil cocks flapping their wings like
what the fuck are we looking at.

995
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:45,450
They have to look at it like 100 x
hundred times the size just to get it.

996
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,820
Or do we see two giant pickled
cocks with wings next to my thigh.

997
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:51,900
Little tiny.

998
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,420
Yeah that's right.

999
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,420
The Sharknado man right.

1000
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,010
Yeah.

1001
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:55,420
That's.

1002
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,610
I think that it's a that's a
terrifying aspect of Rasputin.

1003
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:02,770
Also the fact that they shot him several
times and they kept Yeah poisoned them

1004
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,210
they lost his voice and shot him.

1005
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,360
I think due to the Dick that big as a
special man you probably have a lot of

1006
00:52:09,361 --> 00:52:10,770
special tolerances.

1007
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:13,440
You know it's a rigid human being.

1008
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,000
If you got a big giant cock like that.

1009
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:20,070
It's like the universe is like trying
really hard to get you to breed you know

1010
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:20,390
like.

1011
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,060
Right.

1012
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:25,170
We all know that like penis size no
matter what anybody says it's means

1013
00:52:25,171 --> 00:52:25,800
something.

1014
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,800
If it didn't mean anything it wouldn't
bother if you dig a little it means

1015
00:52:28,801 --> 00:52:29,280
something.

1016
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,030
OK.

1017
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:32,620
And you probably don't need
a gigantic humongous one.

1018
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,950
But if you have one you got that.

1019
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,950
That's that's a big thing with people.

1020
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,030
So when a guy like Rasputin comes
along and he has a giant cock and he's

1021
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:44,040
charismatic with a big giant cock.

1022
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:45,060
Yeah.

1023
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:50,060
It's it's a perfect storm of evil scary
giant horse cock can communicate with

1024
00:52:51,061 --> 00:52:51,894
the dead.

1025
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,340
That's all you need to take over Russia.

1026
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,890
It is a real problem with
people that were gullible.

1027
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:03,630
You know that we want a balloon boy
silly things in over the course of this

1028
00:53:03,631 --> 00:53:04,200
show.

1029
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,910
One of the things that I've found is
how many people get upset at you if you

1030
00:53:08,911 --> 00:53:11,550
don't believe the things
that they believe.

1031
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,530
Yeah well you feel embarrassed.

1032
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,930
I mean yeah part of it
is you feel embarrassed.

1033
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:20,010
You want to defend it because you can't
you know that if you're experiencing

1034
00:53:20,011 --> 00:53:24,180
some strange thing that some part
of you is going to be skeptical.

1035
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,660
And when you decide to believe in the
strange thing then you become very

1036
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:28,320
defensive.

1037
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,410
It's embarrassing.

1038
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,420
And that's that I think
that's why sometimes you
feel a little bit of sympathy

1039
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:37,410
for some of these people but yes they've
invested their lives into ideas that

1040
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:40,740
they haven't fully investigated
or explored in a real way.

1041
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,490
Right.

1042
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:46,490
It's really sad when you know knocking
the legs out from under the table upon

1043
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,850
which rests a person's entire paradigm.

1044
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:54,390
That's a sad thing to see happen you're
watching someone fight against that with

1045
00:53:54,391 --> 00:53:55,260
all their might.

1046
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:56,520
Yeah.

1047
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,590
And we're seeing that every week.

1048
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,410
Yeah yeah.

1049
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:04,110
Every week we're seeing some some
person who believes something.

1050
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:08,490
And I think somewhere along the line the
show is becoming more about psychology

1051
00:54:08,491 --> 00:54:10,350
than it is even about these ideas.

1052
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:11,160
Oh yeah man.

1053
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:16,160
And it's one thing it's taught me is is
that we can't let people who believe in

1054
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:21,330
invisible unprovable things
have any kind of power.

1055
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:22,660
That's what it's showing me like.

1056
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,020
Now a lot of these people
you meet them there.

1057
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,400
They don't have a church a congregation.

1058
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:31,680
They haven't started a religion but you
can see how someone like that if they

1059
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:35,670
had power they would be incredibly
dangerous if you're around somebody.

1060
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:36,400
Yeah.

1061
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,530
Well I think that people having
power in that sense like the.

1062
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,040
Presidential power or king type power
is probably going to be a thing of the

1063
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:47,340
past one day.

1064
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:51,870
I think ultimately we're gonna realize
that anybody that gets to control people

1065
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,370
it's probably a bad idea.

1066
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:57,480
It should all be like some sort of a group
minded thing because if it's not then

1067
00:54:57,481 --> 00:55:01,410
you get led into wars and you get led
into crazy situations bank takeovers and

1068
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:02,820
bailouts and stuff.

1069
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,710
I just saw a video on a Christian show
which is a speech of Ronald Reagan when

1070
00:55:07,711 --> 00:55:12,600
he's president talking about
how he believes that the
end of the world is going

1071
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:16,290
to happen in Israel based
on biblical prophecy.

1072
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,800
This is a president who controls nuclear
weapons and he's free freely saying

1073
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:27,621
this is what I believe it's better
prophesies done in the old testament.

1074
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:33,230
It's like no no your president you can't
believe that you're not supposed to

1075
00:55:33,991 --> 00:55:38,250
believe that yes it's too weak an
idea it's too weak an idea too.

1076
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:42,750
And if you exhibit this week idea it
should disqualify you from controlling

1077
00:55:42,751 --> 00:55:45,720
anything because it says
it's a crazy persons thought.

1078
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,890
So we have to re-evaluate.

1079
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:50,280
Oh did we just let a charismatic
crazy person run things.

1080
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:55,200
Or did we really pick a wise leader
right to the point when the point is a

1081
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:56,620
leader can't really be a leader.

1082
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,760
You need a bunch of people working with
you need a hole and everyone says that.

1083
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:00,840
But there's still a president.

1084
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,400
It should there shouldn't be one.

1085
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:03,420
There shouldn't be.

1086
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,570
There's no fucking way one person
should be running anything.

1087
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:07,170
So yeah.

1088
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:11,100
One person who believes crazy
shit shouldn't be running
anything you know well

1089
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,750
shouldn't be running anything anybody.

1090
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:15,320
No one should be running
a goddamn country right.

1091
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,270
No one it should be the entire
country gets to vote on shit.

1092
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:18,780
Yes.

1093
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:23,340
You know what I think you can go a
totally different sense of who people are

1094
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:24,330
based on that.

1095
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:25,163
Like read it.

1096
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,313
Yeah.

1097
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,960
Run the country with a rabbit.

1098
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,600
Or Yeah I've be true to my or Twitter.

1099
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:32,340
Imagine if you could vote on Twitter.

1100
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:33,420
Yeah I would be amazed.

1101
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,470
It would be incredible.

1102
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:37,440
It would be amazing but also
probably pretty easy to hack.

1103
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,250
Maybe but why can we do
our banking online then.

1104
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,083
Right.

1105
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,133
Good point.

1106
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,840
You tell me you trust it with money
you don't trust it with votes.

1107
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:46,770
That's ridiculous.

1108
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,720
Right sounds like you
want to manipulate votes.

1109
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:49,620
They can do it.

1110
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:52,470
They can do pretty much everything online
with banking and you're dealing with

1111
00:56:52,471 --> 00:56:56,940
millions and billions of dollars every
day going back and forth including the

1112
00:56:56,941 --> 00:56:57,640
stock market.

1113
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,480
Yeah so you're fine with
all that but we can't vote.

1114
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:02,160
Voting is too complicated.

1115
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:03,390
That's the.

1116
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,040
One man one vote.

1117
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,500
What are you trying to say.

1118
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:10,070
The whole system would have a
bunch of hackers getting control.

1119
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:12,990
You want a bunch of guys
with Guy Fawkes masks.

1120
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:15,130
One in this fucking country right.

1121
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:17,940
They can't give it back to the people
and they know that's what that would be.

1122
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:18,870
They do it.

1123
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,710
They can't do it.

1124
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,490
You can never do it.

1125
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:20,930
It'll never.

1126
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:21,760
You'll never be able to vote.

1127
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,620
Well I think you eventually will because
I think the people that are in the

1128
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:29,520
position to control things will eventually
get phased out let new people come

1129
00:57:29,521 --> 00:57:29,640
in.

1130
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,990
I just think it's inevitable because
the generations that are coming up it's

1131
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:36,390
going to be way harder to be as corrupt
as the generations that are in power

1132
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:39,720
that are just used to abusing it
and having that kind of control.

1133
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,160
You wouldn't want that.

1134
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:46,190
Like if you could have the
level of control of like a
Julius Caesar I think it's

1135
00:57:46,501 --> 00:57:47,334
dangerous.

1136
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:48,360
Things change.

1137
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,193
Fuck no.

1138
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,300
I would if it was like me or Hitler.

1139
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:51,930
I'd say yeah.

1140
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:52,763
You know I'm saying.

1141
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:58,010
But it's never that and I think it's
really what it should be is we should all

1142
00:58:00,301 --> 00:58:05,301
have ideas that we share and we should
all have maybe things that we agree on or

1143
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:09,990
disagree on or things that we
can debate public discourse.

1144
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,910
But ultimately it should be a vote should
be 300 million people X amount of them

1145
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:18,640
are over 18 whatever the age do we decide
is it really should be probably 21.

1146
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,110
Yeah.

1147
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:21,660
And then from there on they
get to make the choice.

1148
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:26,730
Yeah but what if what if for example
this voting happens in a country where

1149
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:31,881
people believe in like Sharia law and
believe that women should be covered in

1150
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:37,890
burqas and that you know sort of that
you cut off someone's hand who steals.

1151
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,993
What if there's

1152
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,000
red or white with a machine.

1153
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:43,163
Really.

1154
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,980
Would they convict her of Oh my God.

1155
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,000
That's scary.

1156
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,083
Right.

1157
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,353
Read her mind.

1158
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,560
It was admissible admissible in court
that she actually had prior knowledge of

1159
00:58:55,561 --> 00:58:56,190
this crime.

1160
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:59,590
That's incredible
experience and knowledge.

1161
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,050
That's incredible.

1162
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,790
Not admissible not admissible in the
U.S. Court while tell the story if people

1163
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:09,490
listen to this I didn't hear what
they just said is that there.

1164
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,480
There is a woman in India
that was convicted with this
machine called an F M r.

1165
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:13,860
I.

1166
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,700
What does it stand for.

1167
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:21,530
Functional MRI Magnetic Resonance imagery
is what MRI stands for and that she

1168
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:27,141
was convicted for murder because they
knew that she had some sort of a memory of

1169
00:59:28,891 --> 00:59:32,130
the crime and they were able
to read her mind find that wow.

1170
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,200
Holy shit that's incredible.

1171
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:35,123
That's cool.

1172
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:40,190
I think that eventually we're going to
have a hard drive on our brain and I

1173
00:59:40,801 --> 00:59:45,801
think we're gonna be able to record
life in a way that looks exactly as if

1174
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:47,544
you're live in it.

1175
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:50,700
And I think you'll be able to
watch it and experience it.

1176
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:52,530
I think first of all probably visual.

1177
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,650
But then as people the technology gets
better and better and people get more

1178
00:59:55,651 --> 00:59:56,460
advanced.

1179
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,770
We'll figure out a way to
experience everything too.

1180
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,390
Would be like black and white TV.

1181
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,870
They started out it was just a
black and white television right.

1182
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:07,940
Then also there was color HD stereo
stereo sound worth those winds whistling

1183
01:00:10,591 --> 01:00:12,630
behind human TV today are incredible.

1184
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,720
Yeah but they start out as big stupid
wooden box with this dumb little tube in

1185
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:19,950
the middle of it that look like shit.

1186
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:21,530
It was rounded like a fishbowl.

1187
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:25,680
I think that first they're
gonna start out with video.

1188
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,920
It's gonna be you in the video and have
some sort of an audio and you got to be

1189
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:29,790
a play it back.

1190
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,653
Google Glass.

1191
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:34,380
Something along those lines but it'll
be all the time and you'll be able to

1192
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,100
access it.

1193
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:39,210
You'll have a giant like 18 trillion
terabyte hard drive in your head.

1194
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,610
Yeah and you'll be able to
access your entire life.

1195
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:46,640
So we're gonna have to people are going
to be able to read your minds by just

1196
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,773
taking it out.

1197
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,390
Yeah and like we'll see what Duncan was
doing up beaten off the tranny porn.

1198
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:51,690
Where are you.

1199
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,770
Duncan yelling ball gags and tranny porn.

1200
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:57,170
Sure they'll be able to
find out what you saw.

1201
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:57,800
No way.

1202
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,480
There was nothing wrong with that man.

1203
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,780
And the more we realize the quicker we
realize there's nothing wrong with that

1204
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:05,530
the happier Robbie but the.

1205
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:06,490
The.

1206
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:09,350
The point is that they're going to
be it was gonna be a moot point.

1207
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,090
I think everyone's going to be psychic.

1208
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,530
Yes exactly.

1209
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:17,060
I mean yeah for sure people if you look
at how we already are psychic and not

1210
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:21,140
connected to our heads yet more certainly
way more psychic today than people

1211
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:24,440
were that were living
in like you know 15 20.

1212
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:24,920
Yes.

1213
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:29,150
You know what we can do now is
call it what it call what you will.

1214
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:33,470
The connection is always on and it's
much more powerful and we can do things

1215
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,860
incredible like talk to people that are
on the other side of the world in real

1216
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:37,670
time.

1217
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:38,430
I mean what is it.

1218
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:43,430
I am pregnant misquoted but didn't
Asimov say technology that is an

1219
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:47,060
and a technology.

1220
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:50,090
I'm going to butcher this quote but it's
nothing like a technology an advanced

1221
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:53,480
enough technology would be
indistinguishable from magic.

1222
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,990
Yes that's exactly the quote.

1223
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,850
So that's so that's the idea which is
that if you were to go back and tell

1224
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:02,600
people yes we use wireless signals
to show us where we're going.

1225
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,660
We use wireless signals to communicate
with people on the other side of the

1226
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:06,410
planet.

1227
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:09,320
We use wireless signals to control cars.

1228
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,930
We use wireless signals to do everything.

1229
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:14,720
People be like What are you talking
about how is that even possible.

1230
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:16,130
But now it's real.

1231
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:21,150
And so I'm sure that in the future once
technology becomes more part of us than

1232
01:02:21,741 --> 01:02:26,741
we all become cyborgs then in that way
the notion of being able to mentally

1233
01:02:26,961 --> 01:02:29,960
merge with a person
won't seem insane at all.

1234
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:33,650
In fact you will be able to merge
with the consciousness of the planet.

1235
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:37,370
There'll be some kind of emotional
Internet where you can empathic we

1236
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:42,610
technologically merge with all human
beings and experience the way the entire

1237
01:02:43,131 --> 01:02:44,060
planet feels.

1238
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,360
I think you're absolutely right.

1239
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:48,590
I think that we're starting to feel the
beginnings of this with the Internet

1240
01:02:48,591 --> 01:02:49,670
that we're experiencing today.

1241
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:53,870
I think the Internet is joining
people today in a way that we've never

1242
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:54,800
experienced before.

1243
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,570
And it's just begun.

1244
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,590
And I think the next step is probably
going to be lot more immersive.

1245
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:01,070
Yes.

1246
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:06,070
And that next step might deal with real
time video and audio from person to

1247
01:03:06,351 --> 01:03:10,130
person you might be able
to access people's actual
experiences as they're taking

1248
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:10,790
place.

1249
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:14,780
Sure and then there's going to be
designer augmented realities where you can

1250
01:03:14,781 --> 01:03:19,700
have you can download upgrades just a
normal reality like make your reds redder

1251
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:24,780
yeah make the colors deeper let's turn
it turn let's let's enhance smells and

1252
01:03:25,311 --> 01:03:28,630
they'll be like well let's change smells
all together this turns the smell of

1253
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,990
far into roses.

1254
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,570
So from now on you're not
going to smell any bad things.

1255
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:37,840
And that's going to be
what starts happening as we
begin to enhance our reality

1256
01:03:38,451 --> 01:03:40,670
technologically which I've
heard in Google Glass.

1257
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:44,120
It's already happening like the one
thing that they're desperately trying to

1258
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:46,640
keep out of Google Glass
is facial recognition.

1259
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,380
But someone's already hacked it.

1260
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:51,830
So it does that because the last thing
you want is for a stranger to be able to

1261
01:03:51,831 --> 01:03:56,831
walk up to you with Google Glass scan
your face go do a google image search and

1262
01:03:57,561 --> 01:04:00,800
come up with like Oh hey
Ted do you remember me.

1263
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:01,953
Really.

1264
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,200
That's a problem as you like wait do I
really know you or are you just using the

1265
01:04:06,201 --> 01:04:06,940
Internet.

1266
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,120
So they don't want that to happen.

1267
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:11,000
But the thing about it is
they're already going to hack it.

1268
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,750
That happens and then you can
have like a yelp for people.

1269
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:18,470
You know what I mean so that when you're
doing facial scans for people you could

1270
01:04:18,471 --> 01:04:23,210
see hanging above them douchebag
rapist or pedophile or whatever.

1271
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:28,240
So people are going to be cursed with
this cloud that whatever is about them in

1272
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:33,310
the cloud will be around them and you
can you could change that you can upgrade

1273
01:04:33,311 --> 01:04:34,350
it if you want.

1274
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:39,370
You can make it so that assholes always
have flies swarming around them you know

1275
01:04:40,401 --> 01:04:41,270
to avoid them.

1276
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:42,920
That's a great idea.

1277
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:43,550
Yeah.

1278
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:47,030
If technology really can do that and we
start judging each other based on our

1279
01:04:47,031 --> 01:04:47,864
experiences.

1280
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:50,800
But you're gonna have like you're gonna
have to look at a guy's record to like.

1281
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:51,290
OK.

1282
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:52,910
Who gave you one star.

1283
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:55,550
Oh look at this guy he's an asshole.

1284
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:56,413
Sure.

1285
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:57,380
You could tell.

1286
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:00,140
You know we already can't do that
like you just takes a second.

1287
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:05,280
Yeah I can already get your name and go
on your Facebook account and within 10

1288
01:05:05,331 --> 01:05:07,630
seconds figure out if you're a douchebag.

1289
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,120
Yeah.

1290
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,750
I mean how many times you
gonna to someone's Twitter
and you go Oh I know what's

1291
01:05:11,751 --> 01:05:12,730
going on in your head.

1292
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:13,460
Yeah.

1293
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,690
Quick right away.

1294
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,150
That's sort of psycho in a way.

1295
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:16,670
Yeah.

1296
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:21,670
I mean it's communicative and essentially
the idea of psychic is it cuts out all

1297
01:05:22,671 --> 01:05:24,860
the middlemen and you get
right to the information.

1298
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:25,880
Yeah yeah yeah.

1299
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:30,940
It's a it's a form of technologically
enhanced connectivity that's never existed

1300
01:05:31,551 --> 01:05:36,530
as far as we know on this planet until
today and it's only going to get more and

1301
01:05:36,531 --> 01:05:39,380
more intense and everyone's you know
this is part of the thing where ever it's

1302
01:05:39,381 --> 01:05:43,060
like oh god the NSA they're watching
everything I do there's no more privacy

1303
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:45,080
it's like oh you have no idea.

1304
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,390
You're so lucky right now if you exist
right now this is the last era of

1305
01:05:50,391 --> 01:05:51,224
privacy.

1306
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:54,320
It's already there's hardly any privacy
if you do something dumb enough on a

1307
01:05:54,321 --> 01:05:59,321
city bus the entire planet will
see if you if you murder someone.

1308
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:03,830
It's so much more difficult to get
away with it today than it's ever been

1309
01:06:03,831 --> 01:06:04,250
before.

1310
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,790
Yeah but you can't commit a crime you
commit a crime if you just do something

1311
01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:12,320
embarrassing if you like if you try to
take a burning tequila shot and set your

1312
01:06:12,321 --> 01:06:16,910
face on fire within 30 minutes the entire
planet might be looking at that event.

1313
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:20,900
So privacy is already going
the way of the dinosaur.

1314
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,440
But in 15 years you will
not be able to go outside.

1315
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:25,880
Do you think to be out for it.

1316
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,480
Do you think that's going to
cause a convergence though
a real convergence where

1317
01:06:29,481 --> 01:06:33,710
people have real empathy for other people
because they're experiencing they're

1318
01:06:33,711 --> 01:06:35,570
paying their feelings all the time.

1319
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:40,880
I think that if anything positive can
come out of this connection that human

1320
01:06:40,881 --> 01:06:45,881
beings are experiencing it's going to
be that are going to realize somewhere

1321
01:06:46,991 --> 01:06:51,070
along the line that we're going to all
be a lot better off if everybody's happy

1322
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:55,930
and there must be a way if you can get
two people to be happy or for people to

1323
01:06:55,931 --> 01:06:56,590
be happy.

1324
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:57,670
Why can't you get four million.

1325
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,660
What is missing.

1326
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:00,760
Well at what point in time does it become.

1327
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,320
Does everybody lose value.

1328
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:05,260
Is it 4000 is it forty
thousand four hundred thousand.

1329
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:09,310
There's a number where people stop giving
a shit about certain people they read

1330
01:07:09,311 --> 01:07:10,160
about the newspaper.

1331
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:12,770
If there's only four of you one
of you dies everybody gets sad.

1332
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:16,420
Yeah but if this four million of you
like we lost another one today hey this

1333
01:07:16,421 --> 01:07:18,060
fucking four million people
don't worry about it.

1334
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:19,420
Yeah right.

1335
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:21,710
Man Well I think that's one part of it.

1336
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:25,030
I think the other part of it is there's
going to just be people even more

1337
01:07:25,031 --> 01:07:29,260
addicted and negativity and like the NAB
think so yeah I think the Nancy Grace

1338
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:33,790
show is gonna be really hard to watch
because you'll be able to emotionally tune

1339
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:36,040
into it and guarantee
Nancy Grace if you like.

1340
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,640
Here's the way it feels to be an eight
year old getting strangled to death.

1341
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:43,030
People want to experience
those dark things too.

1342
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:48,080
But I think ultimately it's the ultimate
device of peace because when let's say

1343
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:53,131
the president of Iran sits down with
the president of Israel and they

1344
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:59,520
telepathically merge minds so that one
can experience the totality of the other

1345
01:08:00,341 --> 01:08:05,341
person's life and what they whatever
their religion is and whatever their ideas

1346
01:08:07,241 --> 01:08:12,241
are if those things merge thinking
like oh shit we're exactly the same.

1347
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,230
We really are the same.

1348
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,580
That's that's the problem.

1349
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:19,630
Yeah yeah the problem is if you live
their life you would have a very similar

1350
01:08:19,631 --> 01:08:23,260
way of looking at the world as they do
and they lived yours they would probably

1351
01:08:23,261 --> 01:08:27,820
have all your experiences all your hopes
and dreams and loves and conquests and

1352
01:08:27,821 --> 01:08:30,320
failures all that shit together makes you.

1353
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,930
And unless someone is you.

1354
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,600
It's hard it's hard for
them to understand you.

1355
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:37,600
But when we all can see each
other it's gonna get real weird.

1356
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:41,890
Man it's hard for you to understand you
much less somebody else but you still

1357
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,740
you know where else it's going to ruin
it's going to ruin the meat industry

1358
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:49,480
because the first thing PETA is gonna do
is slap one of these brainwave devices

1359
01:08:49,481 --> 01:08:51,160
on a cow that's about to get slaughtered.

1360
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:54,970
Send that up on the Internet be
like Go ahead eat a cheeseburger.

1361
01:08:55,180 --> 01:09:00,180
But first experienced this insane terror
that that meat felt right before it got

1362
01:09:01,361 --> 01:09:02,170
murder.

1363
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:04,270
I think you're right it's
going to be a weird world.

1364
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,300
I think there's gonna be a lot of weird
things we're gonna be able to experience

1365
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:10,870
a lot of weird ways and we're gonna be
able to be in touch with each other.

1366
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:15,220
And also getting hacked our minds are
gonna be able to get hacked and that's

1367
01:09:15,221 --> 01:09:18,760
another scary thing in the way that
sometimes you wake up and someone will be

1368
01:09:18,761 --> 01:09:22,630
and you'll have like six emails from your
friends being like hey asshole you got

1369
01:09:22,631 --> 01:09:23,440
fished.

1370
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,730
I don't want to buy a purse.

1371
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:27,670
Please stop trying to sell
me purses in the same way.

1372
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:32,410
You might wake up in like your brain has
been hacked and implanted all over your

1373
01:09:32,411 --> 01:09:37,050
brain as the desire to go
eat a cheeseburger to like
go on a certain website.

1374
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:38,740
That's another scary thing.

1375
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:40,603
Yeah.

1376
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,440
Are we go with this episode.

1377
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:44,390
Yeah.

1378
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:46,000
We just have a few little bits to hear.

1379
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:50,620
What do you have to greatest
you haven't been the right.

1380
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:52,813
Right.

1381
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:56,030
But I said it earlier I
talked about the run as to

1382
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:01,560
what you mean what you said is great.

1383
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,880
Kind of do it as if you
haven't been there yet.

1384
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,713
Okay.

1385
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:06,200
Okay.

1386
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,860
So I'm headed to this place called the
Rhine Research Center and it's the gold

1387
01:10:09,861 --> 01:10:13,310
standard for the scientific
study of the paranormal.

1388
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:17,480
Yeah I've heard of them they make the
cards they've been studying the paranormal

1389
01:10:17,481 --> 01:10:19,100
since the 1930s.

1390
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:22,640
So I'm going to go there and
see what they can show me.

1391
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:25,610
What kind of scientific proof they could
demonstrate that apparently they can

1392
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:29,500
show you all the different ways that they
can measure psychic ability and we're

1393
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:30,680
gonna we're gonna try a few out.

1394
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:34,040
Yeah man they're the ones who invented
those psychic cards at those squiggly

1395
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:35,550
lines in the square in the circle.

1396
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,070
They're the ones that
came up with that test.

1397
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,113
Yeah.

1398
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,060
Well apparently they say some
people have innate abilities.

1399
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:41,983
Some people don't.

1400
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:45,830
Some people you can you can sort
of cultivate their their abilities.

1401
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:46,723
Some people can't.

1402
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:47,600
Sure I believe it.

1403
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,690
We'll see.

1404
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:49,730
I'm open minded.

1405
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:50,803
I'll go check it out.

1406
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:51,290
Yeah.

1407
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:52,300
They're very respected.

1408
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,173
Good luck.

1409
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:54,973
So.

1410
01:10:55,010 --> 01:11:00,010
Anyone looking to get more information
on any of these subjects we're talking

1411
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:00,350
about.

1412
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:04,940
Go to sci fi dot com there's like
clips and videos go check that out.

1413
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,310
Spell it because they spell it.

1414
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:12,520
Yeah s y f y dot com people
look was you stupid Sean.

1415
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,950
There's not even science fiction.

1416
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:21,430
You're right but it's as s y f y dot
com they got you on a technicality.

1417
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:28,620
So yeah it's not the sci fi channel
anymore like as an only science fiction.

1418
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:32,240
But it's still pronounced sci fi and
you have a right to be upset at me.

1419
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:35,720
I understand that if I wasn't me and I
was watching this and I wanted to see

1420
01:11:35,721 --> 01:11:39,570
Battlestar Galactica I'd be like
was the fear factor do Sean right.

1421
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:42,920
I'm looking to watch some Battlestar
Galactica some science fiction right but

1422
01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:44,100
it's not just science fiction.

1423
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:48,230
Like you know that one channel that sticks
to their name while learning channel

1424
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,260
that's all about learning as.

1425
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,060
If you have now.

1426
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,030
So I like people wrestling pigs.

1427
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,360
What do they have on now it's all
reality shows learning channel is like.

1428
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:00,483
Well what do they have.

1429
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:03,100
Honey honey boo boo's on
the Learning Channel horn.

1430
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:03,973
What are we learning.

1431
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:06,990
People are really stupid as fuck
and I'm learning I love honey.

1432
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,920
Borders is on blurring show why hoarders.

1433
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:14,630
You say hoarders I think hoarders isn't
hoarders on the arts and entertainment.

1434
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:17,660
There is on arts and entertainment.

1435
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,330
Right.

1436
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:20,030
Because I'm an art or
an entertainment both.

1437
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,330
So you know I don't know man.

1438
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:26,780
I don't.

1439
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:28,040
I don't know about this.

1440
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:33,310
This psychic ability thing I think we
have to wrap it up now but my my take on

1441
01:12:33,621 --> 01:12:38,360
it is I did not feel like in doing the
show that it disproved anything to me.

1442
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:42,080
It did prove to me that there's guys
like Bana check who are absolutely

1443
01:12:42,081 --> 01:12:44,240
masterful at doing what he did.

1444
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,650
However he did it.

1445
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:48,170
He claims that it's a
trick and he's not psychic.

1446
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,250
I believe him.

1447
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:51,440
What he did was amazing though.

1448
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:55,310
So I learned that
there's people like that.

1449
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:58,380
I was really blown away by
his abilities but I didn't.

1450
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,930
It didn't take away from me
the possibility that a guy
like Ed dames can remote

1451
01:13:02,931 --> 01:13:05,270
view or their guy like
Paul Smith can remove you.

1452
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:06,410
I couldn't do it.

1453
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:11,440
I didn't see evidence of it but there's
enough there for me enough anecdotal

1454
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:18,320
evidence enough stories of these guys
seeing things that turned out to be real

1455
01:13:18,321 --> 01:13:22,760
that I would be foolish if I dismissed
it without actually learning how to do

1456
01:13:22,761 --> 01:13:22,970
it.

1457
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:25,430
And that was one of the important
things so I'm going to leave it at that.

1458
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:30,670
I don't know whether or not psychic energy
is real but I am incredibly impressed

1459
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,323
impressed.

1460
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,020
Say again I don't know if psychic energy
is real or psychic abilities real but

1461
01:13:36,021 --> 01:13:41,021
I'm incredibly impressed at
Banamex ability to fake it
and it deems descriptions

1462
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:43,940
of how it works.

1463
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:45,290
So that's where I'll leave it.

1464
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:45,980
Cool.

1465
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,030
I'm in the middle on it.

1466
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,080
I'm all over the place.

1467
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:50,490
I know people out there try
to develop their abilities.

1468
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,553
I should too.

1469
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,290
You know I don't know what's wrong with
me why I don't want to like sit down or

1470
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:55,100
read a book on it.

1471
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:58,040
I really need to figure out what's
what's wrong with me that I don't want to

1472
01:13:58,041 --> 01:13:58,700
give it a chance.

1473
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:02,080
God when I was a kid I used to
read those books all the time.

1474
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:02,943
Did they work.

1475
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:03,500
No.

1476
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,160
But like I would.

1477
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:07,640
I remember reading that you could sit
and like if you stare at the back of

1478
01:14:07,641 --> 01:14:11,570
someone's neck you could make them look
at you Savi riding in the car and just

1479
01:14:11,571 --> 01:14:15,980
staring at the back of my brother's neck
trying to get into turnaround it work.

1480
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:22,250
I mean there's cardio shit i absolutely
tired of my shit and he would turn

1481
01:14:22,251 --> 01:14:23,540
around anyway to punch me.
