1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,360
Here we go,
four,

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,940
three,
two,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,373
one.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,930
And we're live.
Gentlemen,

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,340
thanks for being here.
Appreciate it.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,140
Let everybody know who you are.
Lane.

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,770
Uh,
I'm a meathead who likes science,

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,760
got no bodybuilding when I was young.
Uh,

9
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:24,840
and then did a bs in biochemistry,
phd in Nutritional Science.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,420
Um,
kept lifting,

11
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,170
did powerlifting,
won two national championships,

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,043
got silver medal at worlds within worlds
squat record and it also bodybuilding 

13
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:38,660
and one of the natural pro card.
They actually have natural bodybuilding,

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,970
believe it or not.
And uh,

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,040
throughout that time,
just know when I first got into it,

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,173
one magazine said one thing and even in 
the same magazine they have an article 

17
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:50,010
one month next month that would 
contradicted.

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,513
So I was like,
I'm just going to try and figure this 

19
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:53,910
shit out for myself.
So,

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,330
which is the place that a lot of people 
listening are at right now.

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,343
Yeah.
And it's,

22
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,020
it's tough because it's kind of like,
who do you trust because,

23
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:03,300
nope,
not everybody has the time or the energy

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,460
to go and do a degree in this stuff.

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,050
So.
But that was me.

26
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:09,450
I kinda got down the rabbit hole of,
all right,

27
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:11,400
let's try and figure this nutrition 
stuff out.

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,280
And of course the more I learn,
the more I realized I didn't know.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,110
But uh,
yeah,

30
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:18,570
it just became a passion for me to enter
this day.

31
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:20,940
I'm still very,
I love this stuff.

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,740
This is what gets me up,
gets me going.

33
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:23,574
Well guys,
like you are very important guys who 

34
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:25,854
actually trained very hard and really 
understand the science this is because 

35
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:30,870
it's usually one or the other.
Yeah,

36
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:31,760
absolutely.
Yeah.

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,903
And I like when I was doing,
I graduated my phd in 2010 when we 

38
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:38,214
started.
We actually both knew each other from 

39
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:41,400
the bodybuilding.com
message boards,

40
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,110
so that was back before social media

41
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,630
trained together back in 2006 or seven

42
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,200
seven and experimental biology.
So this big,

43
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,363
there's a big symposium every year for 
science geeks and we were both going to 

44
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:53,984
it and we found out about each other on 
the forums and we went and trained 

45
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:58,430
together and he's a,
he's a beast.

46
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,290
Uh,
and uh,

47
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,124
yeah,
we really hit it off and we've been 

48
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,253
friends since then.
So for everybody who's looking for a 

49
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:06,180
fight,
so sorry,

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,030
we're probably going to be pretty 
friendly.

51
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,560
Well,
it's going to be a conversation.

52
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,350
We don't need to have a fight.
Dom,

53
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,423
you've been on the podcast before,
but for people didn't listen to that 

54
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:15,254
one.
Please tell them who you are and what 

55
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:16,270
you do.

56
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,081
Yeah.
Uh,

57
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:18,550
um,
keep this sucker google.

58
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:18,971
Yeah,
yeah,

59
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:19,910
sure.
Uh,

60
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,640
I will go.
Getting back,

61
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,493
I majored in nutrition actually as an 
Undergrad but didn't actually see a 

62
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:27,730
career in it that much.
So I went into neuroscience,

63
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,940
the net 90,
so it's a decade of the brain and uh,

64
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,803
my,
my formal training is in neuroscience 

65
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:34,474
and it got steered towards basically 
changing the neuropharmacology of the 

66
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:38,614
brain with nutrition and that's what the
key to genic diet does and it has 

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,910
tremendous benefits I think for military
personnel,

68
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:46,480
which is,
um,

69
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,830
funded by the office of navy research 
and the Department of Defense to develop

70
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,310
ketogenic strategies to enhance 
readiness,

71
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:58,690
a resilience and performance and safety 
and military personnel.

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,250
And what,
what did,

73
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,090
why specifically does the key to genic 
diet helped military people?

74
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:08,550
I know there's a thing with a navy seals
with preventing epilepsy.

75
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,170
Yeah,
so a central nervous system,

76
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:12,004
oxygen toxicity,
a limitation of that is a limitation of 

77
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:16,084
navy seal diving is oxygen toxicity 
seizures and a antiepileptic drugs are 

78
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:22,720
not really a viable option because they 
can,

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,600
their side effects,
they can decrease cognitive resilience,

80
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,453
physical resilience,
it key to jenks strategy is something 

81
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,294
that's being studied now from a basic 
science mechanistic perspective to 

82
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:35,800
animal work to now human studies.

83
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,770
So it's not,
you know,

84
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,763
out in the field yet,
but some guys are actually doing it and 

85
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:45,760
I studied the science of that.
And so when people don't understand what

86
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:46,640
we're saying,
um,

87
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,553
for some folks who have epilepsy,
the ketogenic diet has been shown to 

88
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,820
stop seizures.
Absolutely.

89
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:55,930
Go Google the Charlie Foundation.
So that's how I actually got linkedin.

90
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:58,770
And actually I met a natural drug free 
bodybuilder.

91
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,830
His name was Mike Dancer and he had 
severe terminal epilepsy,

92
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,360
Google,
Mike Dancer,

93
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,630
Ketogenic Diet.
And you'll find an amazing story about a

94
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:08,464
guy who used nutrition to manage his 
epilepsy when drugs failed and he used 

95
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:14,464
it to prep and when bodybuilding shows 
and compete in bodybuilding and the 

96
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:22,411
rebreathers sometimes caused seizures 
with some of the soldiers they can.

97
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:23,650
So,
uh,

98
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,620
for example,
just 50 feet of sea water using a closed

99
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:28,950
circuit rebreather,
like a drager,

100
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,720
rebreathers,
50 feet of seawater.

101
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,603
Your potential for getting oxygen 
toxicity seizures can occur in just 10 

102
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,674
minutes.
So that's a little bit of time and 

103
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:37,714
that's not very deep.
So there's no way to predict that and 

104
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:42,430
there's no way as of now to prevent 
that.

105
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,353
So we study physiological biomarkers 
that could warn people of an impending 

106
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:47,884
seizure.
And we also develop countermeasures to 

107
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:53,980
mitigate oxygen toxicity seizures.
I focus mostly on drugs.

108
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:56,650
I'm in a pharmacology and physiology 
department,

109
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,950
but I realized that people with 
epilepsy,

110
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,840
the ketogenic diet was more effective 
than drugs.

111
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,030
So I got steered into,
you know,

112
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,770
nutrition,
which was my undergrad.

113
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:06,604
And then that kicked off about 10 years 
ago and I've just been deep into 

114
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,570
probably a dozen or more different 
applications of nutritional ketosis.

115
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,583
Awesome.
And laying up and paying attention to 

116
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:16,564
online for a long time.
One of the things you do a great job 

117
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:21,400
with is just calling bullshit on.

118
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,290
I mean,
you loved call bullshit clearly,

119
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,640
but whenever people are overstating 
claims or people get ridiculous,

120
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:28,474
and I think this is one of the things 
that is a problem with any diet where 

121
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:35,740
people get really enthusiastic about it.
That becomes an ideology.

122
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:38,930
Whether it's the key to genic died or 
the carnivore diet or the,

123
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,510
you know,
fill in the blanks,

124
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:41,344
Vegan Diet.
People decide this is the end all be 

125
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,490
all.
It's going to cure cancer.

126
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:47,410
Make you smarter,
Dick's going to grow a foot.

127
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,693
All these things are gonna happen.
And you do a great job of calling 

128
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:53,680
bullshit on that kind of stuff.
Yeah,

129
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:54,310
I mean,
I,

130
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,900
I'm not anti Quito,
I'm not anti.

131
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:57,980
I'm anti

132
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,813
bullshit.
And one of the problems we have is 

133
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:04,070
nutrition is replacing religion for a 
lot of people.

134
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,490
So you find something that you identify 
with and then people start to try to say

135
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:13,970
because they identify with that movement
or like for example,

136
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,400
vegans,
they identify with many of them.

137
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,840
Uh,
protection of animals,

138
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,570
not my job to judge their ethics on that
sort of thing,

139
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,213
but then they kind of tried to backtrack
to find the science to support them as 

140
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:27,380
well and they,
they pick and choose.

141
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:29,180
And this is guilty of all groups,
not just vegans.

142
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,580
This is also a lot of key digital diet 
cell.

143
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:34,640
It's a carnivore diet,
whatever have you.

144
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:35,474
If it has the word diet,
there's zealots out there who are going 

145
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:42,950
after it and I will stick up for.
I've stuck up at a scientific conference

146
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:43,910
for the key to genic diet.

147
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,140
Uh,
you were,

148
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,740
we were having a round table about 
something different and somebody said,

149
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,574
well,
we know that the ketogenic diet in 

150
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,730
prayers exercise performance and 
endurance athletes.

151
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:56,040
And I said,
I don't think that's necessarily true of

152
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,343
the,
it's pretty ambivalent or ambiguous as 

153
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:02,810
to whether or not it does.
It seems to be kind of individual.

154
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,700
But on the whole,
on the average,

155
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:06,770
it doesn't seem to impair exercise 
performance.

156
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:09,980
So it's kind of what you like.
But when you have people who,

157
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,980
you know,
like,

158
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,260
like a Gary Taubes,
who says,

159
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:13,580
well,
calories don't matter.

160
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,780
It's all carbohydrates,
that sort of thing of the carbohydrate,

161
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:22,100
insulin model of obesity.
I mean the research is you're able to do

162
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:26,660
a lot of hand waving about insulin and 
when you burn so much fat,

163
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:29,090
when you're on a high fat diet,
which is true by the way you,

164
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,993
you burn a lot of fat,
but what they don't talk about is that 

165
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:32,414
it's it's overall fat balance,
how much fat you store versus how much 

166
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,500
fat you burn,
and when you're on a high fat diet,

167
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,020
you store a lot of fat,
you also burn a lot of fat.

168
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,913
The overall caloric balance is what 
determines whether or not you will have 

169
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:49,670
net storage or net deposition in St 
Louis for high carb Diet as well.

170
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,923
You know this idea that with high 
insulin it just completely shuts down 

171
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,110
all fat burning everywhere that that's 
just not true.

172
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:59,630
Now if you have high carbohydrate,
you will burn less fat,

173
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,030
but you're also storing less fat as 
well,

174
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,373
and again,
the net caloric balance is going to be 

175
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:06,014
what determines how much you store 
because you don't really store 

176
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,810
carbohydrates as fat.
For most people,

177
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,703
they did a study,
a overfeeding women where they overfed 

178
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:16,844
them 50 percent above their caloric 
maintenance and they found that of 282 

179
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:22,460
grams of fat that they stored during the
day and adipose.

180
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,630
Only four grams came from carbohydrate.
Two hundred and 78 came from fat,

181
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,950
so glucose.
What about fructose?

182
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,450
Fructose causes we think you know,
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,

183
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:34,670
so that could be,
you know,

184
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,123
Denovo Denovo lipogenesis is higher with
fructose and you're thinking about 

185
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:44,100
people consuming it in a liquid,
drinks a 100 to 200 grams a day,

186
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,470
which is not uncommon even for my wife,
not uncommon,

187
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,680
so fructose does seem to have a little 
bit of different hepatic metabolism,

188
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,333
but I was actually across the hall from 
a professor who was doing a lot of the 

189
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:57,414
research on fructose and obesity and 
fatty liver disease and even he came to 

190
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,124
the conclusion that if you overfeed 
fruit dose and it creates a caloric 

191
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:09,900
surplus and you're overfeeding for dose,
then you can have some wonky stuff start

192
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,170
to go on relative to other macros.
Die.

193
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,013
Try to keep this,
try to keep this right next to your 

194
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,140
face.
Got It.

195
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,620
Cause that's what she said is so 
powerful.

196
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,620
I talk loud and a lot.
It's good.

197
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,050
Um,
so if you're,

198
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:25,920
if you're doing that,
if you're creating that caloric surplus,

199
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,980
what you find is when you're in net 
storage,

200
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,100
when you're driving more nutrients into 
adipose and sometimes liver depending on

201
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,720
metabolism,
but it takes,

202
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,760
it takes a lot of fructose to do that.

203
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,200
And a caloric surplus,
you start to create a lot of wonky stuff

204
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:44,034
going on.
The Mitochondria starts to become 

205
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,840
dysfunctional and people make a big deal
about,

206
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,980
oh,
well you have,

207
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,890
we have claimed now that everything 
causes,

208
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,680
uh,
obesity and type two diabetes.

209
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,300
For,
for first it was fats,

210
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,153
carbohydrates,
and there's actually a professors out 

211
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:02,220
there who actually will claim the 
protein gives you diabetes.

212
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:03,780
And it's type something for a second.
What I mean,

213
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:07,200
the Mitochondria becomes dysfunctional.
How does the Mitochondrial,

214
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,480
how does that happen?
Okay,

215
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:12,510
so I'm going to state for everybody that
I'm going out on a limb.

216
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,010
This is my opinion.
Okay?

217
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,320
If you look at the research on obesity 
and diabetes,

218
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,480
what happens is you have everything 
start to elevate in the bloodstream,

219
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,463
so if you measure like there was a 
professor who thought that branch chain 

220
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,434
amino acids were causing obesity because
they were elevated in the blood stream 

221
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,880
during or sorry,
during type two diabetes,

222
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,300
well yeah,
branched chain amino acids are elevated,

223
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,210
so fatty acids,
so triacylglycerides,

224
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,403
so as glucose,
so is it really those things causing it 

225
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,843
or is it possible that when you are 
overfeeding relative to what you burn 

226
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,003
relative to that turnover,
that Mitochondria start to become 

227
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,203
dysfunctional?

228
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,460
Probably a lot due to inactivity and the
Mitochondria is,

229
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,800
as we call it,
the powerhouse of the cell.

230
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:02,634
As you probably learned in high school 
biology or whatever they taught it to 

231
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,730
you as that is where everything fluxes 
through.

232
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,623
So that is where you're creating ATP.
That's where you're burning through 

233
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,160
lipids,
carbohydrates,

234
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,370
that sort of thing.
If that becomes dysfunctional and you're

235
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:20,880
not getting in a flux enough pull 
through that Mitochondria,

236
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,020
what happens is you start to back up 
every part of metabolism,

237
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,123
so all the metabolic byproducts,
almost all of them inhibit everything 

238
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:31,740
within the cell.
There's a metabolomic signature for that

239
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,653
and Epi phenomenon,
if you want to call it that would be 

240
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:38,220
elevated branched chain amino acids 
because the consequence of that and some

241
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:40,950
people,
so these things start these byproducts,

242
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:41,784
these metabolic byproducts,
because you're not flexing enough 

243
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:44,184
through the cell.
They start accumulating within the cell 

244
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,913
and start to inhibit the krebs cycle 
glycolysis and so everything starts 

245
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:50,964
backing up to the point where you also 
start inhibiting the insulin receptor 

246
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,510
and now you have glucose,
fatty acids and amino acids.

247
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,433
Also backing up to the point where they 
start to overspill into the bloodstream 

248
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,843
and you see these,
this accumulation of all of them in the 

249
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:12,331
bloodstream in type two diabetes.
And I actually think that again,

250
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,570
me going out on a limb that obesity 
doesn't cause type two diabetes and type

251
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:17,404
two diabetes doesn't cause obesity.
That they develop in concert from the 

252
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:23,560
same problem,
which is overfeeding under activity,

253
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,993
so a lot of it is about how much 
nutrients you're fluxing into cells 

254
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:32,830
versus how much energy you're creating.
Fluxing them through the cell on out,

255
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,710
so when you're overfeeding,
whether it be carbohydrate,

256
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,310
fat,
your fluxing more energy in than you can

257
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:40,144
dispose of,
and now you have to do something with 

258
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:43,121
it.
Well,

259
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:43,954
when you run out of,
when you do that much to it and 

260
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,850
Mitochondria start to become 
dysfunctional,

261
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,343
dysfunctional,
you start to not have enough places to 

262
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:53,494
put it away and it starts spilling into 
the bloodstream and now you cause all 

263
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:56,284
kinds of problems.

264
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,423
So one of the things that we really 
wanted to talk about here is high carb 

265
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:04,450
versus low carb because this is a just a
giant point of contention today.

266
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,284
Nutrition,
especially in terms of athletes with 

267
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:10,930
performance in mind.
That's a big factor.

268
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,300
Whether or not high carb or low carb is 
the way to go.

269
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,283
And there's a lot of zealots on both 
sides and there's a lot of bullshit and 

270
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:17,164
there's a lot of online experts.
And one of the great thing about 

271
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:21,184
bringing you two guys in here is because
you could really actually explained the 

272
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:24,514
science behind it.
Now you've been great lane at pointing 

273
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:32,530
out that there's,
it's not a magic bullet and you know,

274
00:13:32,531 --> 00:13:37,030
and so many people like to sort of 
stress it that way,

275
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:37,864
that they,
they like to portray ketogenic diet is 

276
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,571
this,
is it,

277
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,680
this is the end all,
be all.

278
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,513
I figured out what to do.
This is the way everyone should be 

279
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:46,060
eating.
You don't think so?

280
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,033
I don't think so,
because if you look at the weight loss 

281
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,230
problem in our society,
uh,

282
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,153
and I'm,
I'm writing a book called fat loss 

283
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,370
forever.
When I talk about this in detail,

284
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,623
we don't have a weight loss problem.
Six out of every seven people were able 

285
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:02,134
to lose a significant amount of body 
weight in their life who are obese or 

286
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,374
overweight.
The problem is the weight regained 

287
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:10,530
statistics are absolutely terrifying.
Uh,

288
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,420
within one year,
70 percent will put it all back on.

289
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,920
Within two years it's 85 percent.
Within three years it's 95 percent.

290
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:22,510
So that means diets have a 95 percent 
failure rate and of those people,

291
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:23,344
one third to two thirds will add more 
than they originally lost and this gets 

292
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:29,410
kind of into Yoyo dieting and I talked 
about that as well.

293
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,663
But the real problem is that people 
don't stick to pick something that's 

294
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:40,510
sustainable for them all the recert,
if there's one bit of research out there

295
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:41,344
that,
that we have that shows how to create 

296
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:44,614
lasting weight loss.
And you look at the people who were the 

297
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:48,970
five percent who actually keep it off,
uh,

298
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,160
it's that they pick something that's 
sustainable,

299
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,380
whether it be key to genic,
whether it be low carb,

300
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,930
high or low fat,
whatever it is,

301
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,380
Vegan something that they can sustain 
and make a lifestyle.

302
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,430
If,
because if you look at Meta analyses for

303
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:06,310
our listeners,
med analyses are,

304
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,203
are kind of a study of studies.
So they take researchers take studies 

305
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:12,614
that have similar parameters and they 
kind of lumped them together and they 

306
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:16,281
look at,
okay,

307
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:18,200
what's the consensus amongst these 
studies?

308
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:20,360
And they have advanced statistics.
They used to run this.

309
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,243
If you look at low carb versus low fat,
there's no difference in adherence 

310
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:27,944
overall on the whole there's no 
difference and there's no difference in 

311
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:33,950
weight loss,
there's no difference in blood lipids,

312
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:34,843
even glycaemic control.
So there was a study where they met 

313
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:39,260
analysis of,
I think it was 23 studies,

314
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:41,780
over 3000 people where they looked at,
okay,

315
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:44,180
if you control calories,
so calories are equated,

316
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,380
does low carb versus low fat make a 
difference on weight loss,

317
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,810
glycemic control,
those sorts of things.

318
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,893
The key to genic diet.
So by definition we have an objective 

319
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:57,554
biomarker that defines the ketogenic 
diet is the only diet that actually has 

320
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,124
something that you can measure in your 
blood that say you're on this diet and 

321
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:08,630
when your ketone levels are elevated,
that confers many different benefits,

322
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,553
uh,
that I believe can enhance adherence to 

323
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:14,780
the Diet.
Before we get into the woods here,

324
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,033
I want to clarify one thing,
the difference between someone being on 

325
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:20,474
a diet and being able to sustain it and 
not being able to stand in gaining all 

326
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,414
that weight back.

327
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,000
Isn't that a discipline issue?
Well,

328
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,510
partly,
but we kind of had to start looking at,

329
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,860
okay,
if we,

330
00:16:31,861 --> 00:16:34,290
if we go in,
let me read,

331
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,213
let me read circle.
We have to find what requires the least 

332
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:40,200
amount of discipline for somebody to 
stick to.

333
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:43,140
Because discipline is,
is while some people have more,

334
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,690
some people have less.
Um,

335
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,823
it is a finite resource.
So when do we normally find that people 

336
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:53,160
like kind of drop off whatever they're 
doing.

337
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,980
It's when they're stressed out,
work,

338
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,530
stressing them out,
they're going through a divorce,

339
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,970
those kinds of things,
right?

340
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:00,804
That's where are our discipline kind of 
wanes because we're trying to be so 

341
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:06,660
disciplined for this other thing and 
it's draining us.

342
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,990
So what happens with,
with diet is in people who are busy,

343
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,610
people who have a lot of stress in their
life,

344
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,540
that's where they really start 
overeating.

345
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,070
So we have to find something that I look
at it.

346
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,320
Let's find something that requires the 
minimal amount of,

347
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,280
of discipline for a person so that when 
your life goes to absolute shit,

348
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,810
you can still stick to it.
And so for some people that is a very,

349
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:31,644
very individual thing and they see this 
in the dietary studies that what works 

350
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:37,074
for one person to create a deficit and 
sustainable isn't the same way for 

351
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:43,320
another person.
And Dom even commented on this about his

352
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:44,154
wife Chella,
she does much better on a higher ratio 

353
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:48,810
of carbohydrates to fats.

354
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,891
Yeah,
I mean,

355
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:50,160
early

356
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,993
on it was obvious that she wasn't going 
to change her diet at the time that we 

357
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,980
met like 10 years ago,
most we,

358
00:17:55,981 --> 00:18:00,390
I was really getting into this and I 
really felt that for me at least,

359
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:03,000
uh,
but she would stop at checkers and get a

360
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:07,590
burger with a sugary drink it.
And she's tremendously carbon tolerance.

361
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:12,591
She was very skinny as a kid and she 
tolerated a carbohydrate.

362
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,290
She's very carbohydrate tolerance.
Did I say intolerant?

363
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:15,900
Okay.
Uh,

364
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,010
yeah.
So,

365
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:18,150
and,
and you know,

366
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:23,151
if the Diet low carb I feel,
and maybe in key to genic,

367
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:24,174
putting it in under that umbrella works,
I think for up to 25 to 30 percent of 

368
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,270
people,
uh,

369
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,790
especially at their carbohydrate 
intolerant.

370
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,210
And I believe that it does that by 
virtue of elevating Ketones,

371
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,400
shifting your,
uh,

372
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,930
the neuropharmacology of the brain,
for example,

373
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,370
it works through Grelin,
it works through,

374
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:45,204
there's new science emerging right now 
showing that appetite regulation is 

375
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:50,334
influenced a positively by a nutritional
ketosis in ways that were just starting 

376
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:55,890
to learn.

377
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,720
Now what?
You can certainly feel it.

378
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,150
It's one of the things about the 
ketogenetic diet.

379
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:00,984
When you're in that state,
all of a sudden you're just not hungry 

380
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:06,210
to say there's not a,
an overwhelming need for food.

381
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,960
Yeah,
I'm,

382
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,880
I haven't had anything to eat today.
I mean,

383
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:09,714
when I was eating massive plates of 
Pasta Twenty five years ago and I went 

384
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,760
to this this long without food,
I would start getting shaky.

385
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:19,710
I would,
I would have a hypoglycemic response.

386
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,573
And I'm completely resilient to that.
And that has major implications for 

387
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:26,910
military personnel being keto adapted,
not just for performance,

388
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:31,200
preventing seizures.
I think for a cognitive function too.

389
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,270
But you,
uh,

390
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,170
it's very liberating.
So meal frequency is not an issue.

391
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,063
So if you're in austere environments 
where you have limited food 

392
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:42,180
availability,
that becomes a major issue.

393
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,150
And if you're working as a scientist and
you can't,

394
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,500
you know,
you're working with animals,

395
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:48,060
you're doing experiments,
you don't have time to eat.

396
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,820
I need to maintain that cognitive 
function.

397
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:52,130
I needed to be sharp,
you know,

398
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,380
with limited boot.
So it worked very good for me throughout

399
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:56,590
my professorship,
you know,

400
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,523
getting tenure and things like that 
where I could just put more time and 

401
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,130
energy into my work without having to 
stop,

402
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,900
prepare a meal,
eat a meal,

403
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:04,734
clean up.
Like I think I wasted a lot of time 

404
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:09,090
doing that when I was eating five to six
meals a day.

405
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,153
He said something that I think you've 
called bullshit on before the phrase 

406
00:20:14,251 --> 00:20:17,130
carb intolerant.
So yeah.

407
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:19,110
So that was actually going to be one of 
the things that could say,

408
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:20,670
hey,
we have something we can disagree about.

409
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,770
Carb tolerance,
carb,

410
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,590
carb.
Would you would say how we define that?

411
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,430
Yes.
Yes.

412
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,320
So if you have to find it by a blood 
marker,

413
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,940
your glucose response to a meal.

414
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,730
Okay.
So a couple of things.

415
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,240
I want to come right out and frame this 
whole discussion real quick.

416
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:39,930
So we both agree that in terms of weight
loss and body composition,

417
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:43,020
that your total calorie intake per day 
is the most important thing,

418
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,940
correct?
Yes.

419
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:49,450
I believe the key to genic strategy is a
way to regulate that,

420
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,150
right?
So with,

421
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,770
with carbon tolerance,
if,

422
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,730
if you look at the benefits of like on 
blood glucose,

423
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,623
blood lipids,
it is almost 90 to 95 percent explained 

424
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,424
by weight loss.
So you can take people put them on a 

425
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:07,570
high carb,
very low fat diet,

426
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,660
their blood glucose in their blood,
lipids will drop,

427
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,940
eat even with like higher insulin levels
than people who are in a a low carb diet

428
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,540
if they're on a calorie restricted 
calorie restricted.

429
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,463
Now again,
that that becomes a very individual 

430
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:22,840
thing.
I,

431
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,070
you know,
if somebody says,

432
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:24,904
hey,
I like a ketogenic diet because for me 

433
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:28,330
it helps me to create a calorie deficit.

434
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,680
I can stick to it,
hey,

435
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:31,690
knock yourself out.
That is no problem.

436
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,583
But that is not always gonna work.
Some people don't feel that satiated on 

437
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:39,070
a ketogenic diet.
There are people who do feel hungrier on

438
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:41,770
that.
So that is a very individual response.

439
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:44,650
And again,
when we look at studies we're looking at

440
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:45,640
means,
right?

441
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:48,850
So we're talking about averages and 
there are outliers,

442
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:51,190
like if you look at any Gaussian 
distribution chart,

443
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:52,024
which is kind of how populations 
distributed based on a certain 

444
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:54,724
treatment,
you have about 60 to 70 percent that 

445
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:58,390
fall into the,
the average.

446
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,870
Then you have another,
you know,

447
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,783
10,
20 percent that are kind of do a little 

448
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:06,550
bit better one way versus the other.
And then you have five percent on either

449
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:07,384
end that are,
sorry,

450
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,160
two and a half percent on either end 
that are outliers.

451
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,280
Right?
So just to frame this again,

452
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:13,180
let's take weightlifting.

453
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,160
We know weightlifting makes you bigger 
and stronger,

454
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,870
right?
Like that is not up for debate.

455
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,763
We agree on that.
There are studies that have shown that 

456
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,093
some people who are beginners,
where you should be gaining a lot of 

457
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,530
muscle very quickly,
uh,

458
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,503
some people will go from the first time 
they walk into the gym Squat Ninety 

459
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,451
Five,
12 weeks,

460
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:29,620
they're,
they're squatting 400 pounds.

461
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,130
Some people don't get stronger.
They've actually been.

462
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:33,964
Studies were over 12 weeks.
There is a few individuals who did not 

463
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:38,830
get stronger,
so those are your outliers right there.

464
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:41,320
So if we circle this back to Ketogenic 
Diet,

465
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,460
I'm not sitting here and saying that 
somebody may actually physiologically do

466
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:50,320
better on a ketogenic diet versus a a,
a lower fat diet.

467
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,700
That's a very individual response,
but when we start making recommendations

468
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:55,534
for people,
what we should start with is okay 

469
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,823
created calorie deficit that allows you 
to lose some weight because if we look 

470
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:04,570
at the studies and we look at if we 
equate for protein,

471
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,620
because that's a big thing.

472
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,610
So if you look at some of the studies 
were Volec did where he compared like,

473
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,933
uh,
you're kind of food guide pyramid type 

474
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:13,744
diet to a ketogenic diet.
The ketogenic diets were a little bit 

475
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:17,674
higher protein.
That protein has a thermogenic effect 

476
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:23,590
and also an appetite suppression effect 
when you equate for those.

477
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,513
And there's been 32 studies,
there was a recent med analysis done of 

478
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,770
32 studies and acquainted for calories 
and protein.

479
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,443
Absolutely no difference in fat loss 
when you equate for those two calories 

480
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:36,424
and protein because protein is a big one
because protein has a big benefit on 

481
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:43,780
thermogenesis and weight loss.
Also a lean body,

482
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:46,370
mass retention,
which is huge because one of the reasons

483
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:48,560
people regain weight is because when 
they lose weight,

484
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,630
they tend to lose fat and muscle and 
when they regain it,

485
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:53,660
it's almost all fat in the initial phase
as far as

486
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,050
and may not have included data with the 
key to genic diet.

487
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,550
So I know,
you know,

488
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:00,800
when I did the die,
I've seen a lot of blood work,

489
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:02,330
so for example,
my hemoglobin h,

490
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:04,100
one c,
triglycerides,

491
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,440
hs,
crp goes down,

492
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:08,480
insulin goes down,
blood pressure goes down,

493
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,550
and that,
that all those,

494
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,120
all those changes happened without my 
bodyweight changing.

495
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,640
So that would kind of argue against 
that.

496
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:19,000
You needed to catch us deficit.
Uh,

497
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:22,030
and I've seen it many times,
but once you could,

498
00:24:22,031 --> 00:24:22,864
I could be eating 80 to 90 percent carbs
and reduced my body weight and get 

499
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:29,930
changes in all that I could actually 
increase my carbs.

500
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,260
And if I create a calorie deficit,
you know,

501
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:34,730
my hemoglobin h,
one c will go down,

502
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:35,960
my sugar will go down and things like 
that.

503
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:40,250
So that is really the draw that's like,
that trumps everything,

504
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,830
that calorie deficit,
so that that's an important thing.

505
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,783
So that's what.
And that's what I think a lot of people 

506
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:45,800
miss.
Okay.

507
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,410
I think that that,
what I'll say is.

508
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:50,960
Sorry,
I'm just saying like,

509
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,560
I think

510
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,393
it's very powerful too that these 
changes that I just mentioned can occur 

511
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:58,610
without a will,
without changing your body weight.

512
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,750
So they are just,
you know,

513
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:04,100
you're fundamentally changing your 
metabolism when you do that from car.

514
00:25:04,101 --> 00:25:07,070
And that has pretty wide ranging 
implications.

515
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,030
So I think that what I'm going to say is
that if you,

516
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,310
if we're going to talk about people 
getting healthier,

517
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,743
the first thing we need to start with is
let's not lose 50 percent are going 

518
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,760
about five percent,
right?

519
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,590
So if I tell somebody,
hey,

520
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,830
find a diet,
you can stick to that sustainable.

521
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,083
And if you can lose 10 percent,
you can lose 10 percent of your body 

522
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:29,060
weight.
Even for obese people,

523
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,870
they get almost all the health benefits 
in the first 10 percent now.

524
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,303
Now maybe some people like you or people
who respond really well to a ketogenic 

525
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:37,904
diet,
I'm not,

526
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,743
again,
there's outliers or people on the other 

527
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:41,414
sides of the Gaussian curve.
If you do a little bit better on there 

528
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,553
then great,
but if you find a ketogenic diet is 

529
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,850
completely unsustainable for you and 
you're not,

530
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,703
you're not able to stick to it,
but you're trying to do it because 

531
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:55,280
you're trying to get a little bit better
blood glucose regulation.

532
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,620
You're,
you're,

533
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,683
you know,
you're kind of shooting yourself in the 

534
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:02,270
foot because if you could stick to it,
like let's say for the individual,

535
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,580
a higher carb diet was easier for them 
to stick to.

536
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,653
They could lose weight on that.
Then that's the bulk of their health 

537
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:09,044
benefits they're going to get from it.
I'm having a hard time with these terms 

538
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,590
easier because I don't know exactly why 
it would be easier,

539
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:18,230
wouldn't be easier and I always wonder 
again,

540
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:21,080
is this a discipline issue because 
that's your experience.

541
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,320
Yeah,
it comes down for this,

542
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,070
for sure.
My

543
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:24,903
preference,
but I believe that by when you follow 

544
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,360
low carb,
not even ketogenic diet,

545
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:35,680
the variability of the fluctuations in 
your insulin and Blood Glucose,

546
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,530
the Postprandial dip in blood glucose 
that you get after it,

547
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,633
that's virtually abolished or 
significantly attenuated and then you 

548
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:44,280
have a,
you know,

549
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,250
ketones are working through Grelin for 
example.

550
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:48,084
You could just,
you could eat a normal diet and drink 

551
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:52,260
ketones and it's actually suppressing 
your appetite through Grelin.

552
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,400
So we know that these changes or 
reductions in and you're saying,

553
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,383
yeah,
okay,

554
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,530
so um,
so these changes are happening,

555
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:05,880
but they're,
my sister for example,

556
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,743
you know,
follow the Ketogenic Diet and found it 

557
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:10,074
easy to follow.
But she gained weight because she was 

558
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:13,260
eating all these fat bombs that she was 
making.

559
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,123
So she far and a lot of people don't 
necessarily need a nutritionist to tell 

560
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:20,274
them what to do,
but they needed like a nutritional 

561
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,810
psychotherapist or something,
you know,

562
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,860
their,
their relationship with food is really.

563
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,560
And I think that's what lane has a firm 
grasp on.

564
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,423
There's no substitute for experience.
And Lane has worked with so many 

565
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:34,230
different clients and knows that,
you know,

566
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:37,710
you could probably follow the cue j dot 
your listeners are probably fans of die.

567
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,290
I can do it.
I love fatty food,

568
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,300
you know,
a high fat food look our food.

569
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,360
But generally speaking it's,
you know,

570
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:49,320
you have to approach it from the 
perspective of sort of eating behavior.

571
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,260
And I think that that's really.
People want to go off the Diet.

572
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:53,580
It's just a natural human trait.

573
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,770
Yeah,
it's a weird psychological trait,

574
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,150
right?
You just want to cheat.

575
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,940
You want to just stuff your face with 
cupcakes every now and then.

576
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:00,774
And then you just feel like it's too 
much torture to keep yourself on this 

577
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:06,360
narrow path of high fat,
low carb,

578
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,400
moderate protein.
But you know,

579
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,950
years ago,
10 years ago that was the case.

580
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:15,250
But now there is key to genic brownies 
or cookies.

581
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:17,230
There's many different food companies 
like shirt

582
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,180
got chicken.
I've tried,

583
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:22,840
I tried so hard.
Go to Quito.

584
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,713
I have a real one and a kito cookie and 
then fucking real fucking gets eaten 

585
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:29,920
every time.
Yeah,

586
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,880
well they,
they are evolving.

587
00:28:31,881 --> 00:28:32,200
Just,
you know,

588
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,410
food technology and evolving some of 
them,

589
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,010
no foods,
make some good stuff.

590
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,170
Go to go to Quito,
nutrition.org.

591
00:28:38,171 --> 00:28:40,580
And there's some things there that I 
would say about 10 or 20

592
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,453
percent passed the test,
meaning that they taste okay and they 

593
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:48,330
actually do what they say they actually 
elevate ketones or you know,

594
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:49,440
don't call it the glycine

595
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,210
on some of those Keto Kookies seem like 
they have no foundation.

596
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,870
Like you bite in the Galway,
like as you're eating them,

597
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,123
it's like they dissolve.
Do you have like a good toll house 

598
00:29:00,951 --> 00:29:01,784
cookie,
a good real chocolate chip cookie and 

599
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:05,930
you bite into that soccer,
you know,

600
00:29:05,931 --> 00:29:06,764
it's bad for you.
But God damn it feels good while it's 

601
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:10,760
being tried.
The quest protein cookies.

602
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,780
Yes.
They're pretty good.

603
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,653
Yeah.
Pretty good.

604
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,791
Pretty good.
Yeah.

605
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:15,490
They can't fuck with real cookies.
Yeah.

606
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,280
Well I dip.
I dip them in,

607
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:18,690
in like sour cream,
right?

608
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:19,643
And then I eat them or coconut cream so 
that then it becomes good to just get a 

609
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,760
commitment to a life that you bring that
up.

610
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,150
Interesting though.
Um,

611
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,970
if you look at people that think they're
addicted to sugar,

612
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,813
that sugar is a lot.
If you look at things like cookies and 

613
00:29:35,961 --> 00:29:40,220
cakes and it's actually they have more 
calories from fats than they do sugars.

614
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,340
It's sugar and fat together

615
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,173
is hyper palatable.
But so we know one of the things I was 

616
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,720
going to bring up as,
um,

617
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,843
you know,
this idea that the sugar is so 

618
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:52,540
inherently bad and you said that the 
cookie,

619
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,670
you know,
we view that as an inherently bad thing.

620
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,130
But what if I told you that a certain 
people,

621
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,080
not everybody,
everybody's different,

622
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,270
but there are certain people who,
if you tell them,

623
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,980
hey,
you can have that cookie every once in a

624
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:05,620
while if you track it,
work it into your macronutrient intake,

625
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,800
that that's fine,
that,

626
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,530
that actually improve their adherence to
diet.

627
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,430
So because you give them a reward,
no,

628
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,990
not a reward system.
You're not a dog,

629
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,400
don't reward yourself with food because,
because increased flexibility,

630
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:20,800
uh,
actually usually improves adherence.

631
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,083
So we see this actually with training to
a athletes are when you do a flexible 

632
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:28,600
training model where they have to get in
a certain amount of training,

633
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:30,690
but they kind of can pick and choose 
yourself,

634
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,790
which days are hard and which days are a
little bit they actually do better.

635
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,163
Diet is very similar to that.
So now you always have to sacrifice 

636
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:41,600
something in order to,
uh,

637
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,850
if you want to lose weight,
right?

638
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:45,490
So if you're doing a ketogenic diet,
what you're sacrificing is saying,

639
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:48,280
well I like the spontaneous reductions 
in appetite,

640
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,114
so I don't mind eating these foods so I 
can get that if you're doing like kind 

641
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:56,110
of what,
I don't want to say I popularized it,

642
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:56,944
but myself and some other people on the 
message boards popularized something 

643
00:30:58,601 --> 00:30:59,434
called flexible dieting where you can 
eat essentially whatever you want as 

644
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:05,950
long as you hit your protein,
carbohydrate and fat targets.

645
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,100
Now what you're sacrificing is okay.
You're tracking every day.

646
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,220
Do you do that through an APP?
Through what?

647
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,290
An APP?
Uh,

648
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,180
no,
I'm old school.

649
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:17,260
I actually just do it through excel.
I've my girlfriend holly,

650
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:22,261
she has an app on her phone and she,
she has me like if she's driving,

651
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,470
said,
oh well you put in what I just ate.

652
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,161
I'm like,
Babe,

653
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:27,310
I don't even know.
I have no idea how to work this thing.

654
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:31,810
You know?
So because when I went to do my graduate

655
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:34,180
studies,
I mean I wanted to find magic foods.

656
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,370
I wanted to find something that would 
say,

657
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,790
how else can you make a living?
You have to set yourself apart.

658
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,970
I mean if I'm over here saying it's hard
for me to sell what I,

659
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,890
what I do,
because I'm saying,

660
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,753
well,
everything in moderation and you got to 

661
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:48,244
be diligent and you got to have these 
behaviors and that doesn't sound sexy 

662
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:52,030
when there's another guy over here 
saying,

663
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,770
now bro,
it's just carbs.

664
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:55,780
I know what tablet isms complicated and 
everything,

665
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,190
but it's just carbs.
You know,

666
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,643
when I started working with people and 
I've worked with over 1500 people 

667
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,930
coaching and nutrition online over the 
past 13 years,

668
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:06,600
which actually probably taught me more 
than my,

669
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,140
my phd did.
Um,

670
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,593
what I found was,
is that people were so different 

671
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,430
individually in terms of what,
what made them tick,

672
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,593
you know,
now I feel like I should probably go 

673
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:18,874
back and get some kind of interesting to
biologically what makes them tick or a 

674
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:22,930
psychological,
both,

675
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,853
both,
so I can't sit here and say by the 

676
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:30,931
research that that carbohydrate versus 
fat makes a difference on fat loss.

677
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:32,883
But what I can tell you is that some 
people just seem to do better on lower 

678
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:37,780
carb,
higher fat.

679
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,980
But also some people I with just seem to

680
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,050
do better with higher carb,
lower fat.

681
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,123
Now,
whether that's a psychological thing or 

682
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:46,940
a physiological thing,
it's hard to tease out medically to.

683
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:49,580
I think we all have different snips,
you know,

684
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,443
that,
you know,

685
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,480
some people have suppressed fatty acid 
oxidation pathways,

686
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:56,060
other are like screaming fast 
metabolizers,

687
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:58,340
you know,
or fat or sugar metabolizers.

688
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,720
Yeah.
So,

689
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:00,554
but if you look at,
like I remember I had a conversation 

690
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,214
with,
um,

691
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,093
with the,
the researcher Dr Nakamura at Illinois 

692
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:12,050
who was doing some of that fructose 
stuff when I was,

693
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,820
when I was a first year Grad student.
I said,

694
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,791
well,
it's this,

695
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:17,150
this high fructose corn syrup,
this is what's causing obesity.

696
00:33:17,151 --> 00:33:18,740
Right?
And he's like,

697
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,230
well,
it's easy to over consume.

698
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,153
You know,
like if you take a soda and you drink 

699
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:25,760
it,
you're not less hungry than you were.

700
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,990
Stopped,
very satiating.

701
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,333
He said,
but if you're,

702
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,173
if you're controlling your calories,
it doesn't seem to be more lysogenic 

703
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,290
than comparable carbohydrate.

704
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,720
And I remember thinking,
well,

705
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,693
that can't be right.
All these people say that high fructose 

706
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:39,290
corn syrup,
it was like the worst thing in the world

707
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,030
for you.
There was,

708
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,390
there was a few studies that really 
changed my opinion on sugar.

709
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,620
Now the listeners are going to hear this
and think that I'm advocating for sugar.

710
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,513
I'm not,
not talking about in the context of a 

711
00:33:50,991 --> 00:33:55,991
calorie surplus,
a surplus than the ovary can,

712
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,550
which kind of explains the state of the 
United States,

713
00:33:58,551 --> 00:33:59,384
you know,
uh,

714
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,360
partly partly.
So if you look at sugar intake,

715
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:03,723
there's.
So this Kinda gets back to the 

716
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:06,230
carbohydrate,
insulin obesity model.

717
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,273
Uh,
if you look at sugar intake over the 

718
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:09,950
last 50 years,
100 years,

719
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,113
it went up very steadily with obesity 
until around the mid nineties and then 

720
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:17,690
it took a sharp dip while obesity 
continued to climb.

721
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,970
And again,
that's just correlation data.

722
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:24,590
But if you do look at the overall 
calorie intake versus obesity rates,

723
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:27,200
it's like an r squared of like point 
nine four,

724
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,093
which is really,
he really sugar include high fructose 

725
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,820
corn syrup.
Is that lumped into.

726
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:34,060
So this was added sugars,
this was added sugars,

727
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,870
but there was a study done by a 
metabolic ward studies.

728
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,010
So again,
I'm gonna stop you there.

729
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,850
Are you saying that this is added 
sugars,

730
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,933
not high fructose fructose corn syrup.
So when you talk about the graph of 

731
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:49,460
consumption,
that sugar dropped off,

732
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:51,520
but high fructose corn syrup did not.
Is that our,

733
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,350
because that took over many of the 
products.

734
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,850
So it's an increase in obesity,
but a decrease in sugar consumption.

735
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,120
But you're not saying a decrease in high
fructose corn syrup consumption.

736
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:04,370
So I don't know that I'd have to look 
that up.

737
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,420
So here,
here's,

738
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,940
here's me being a scientist in saying 
the three magic words,

739
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:08,774
I don't know that one of the last 
conferences I went to showed that like 

740
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:15,340
the rise over the last 10 to 15 years 
like skyrocketing,

741
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:18,050
like high fructose corn syrup and sugar 
was taken out.

742
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:21,910
High Fructose Corn Syrup is subsidized 
but farmers a lot cheaper and more.

743
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,980
Would you agree that it's essentially 
your body way?

744
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:29,290
Processes is essentially the same sugar 
versus high fructose corn syrup cows the

745
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,200
calorie.
Well,

746
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,460
so sugar,
sucrose is 50 percent glucose.

747
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:35,294
Fifty percent fructose,
high fructose corn syrup is 55 percent 

748
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:38,190
fructose,

749
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,023
45 percent glucose.
But if you're saying that that five 

750
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:44,400
percent is what's creating obesity,
eh?

751
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,680
Now again,
psychologically,

752
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,170
some people just down sodas like it's 
their job,

753
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,550
you know?
And if you're doing that,

754
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,500
especially as children,
that's a big,

755
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:53,334
big no,
no,

756
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,183
he kissed the Mexican kind with the cane
sugar kids now with high with 

757
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,840
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and 
that did not exist.

758
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:04,650
But I would say that we've got a little 
kid like kids from corn syrup.

759
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,543
I think it's due to an excess surplus 
calories and those surplus calories 

760
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,690
being high fructose corn syrup.
So if you're,

761
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,960
if you're used to eating a certain 
amount of calories and you may,

762
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:17,590
and we back when we were actually 
maintaining your weight back in the,

763
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,473
before the sixties,
we were reading about 2100 calories a 

764
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:21,540
day.
That was the average.

765
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,880
Uh,
and now it's like 2,800

766
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,580
is the average consumption.

767
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,650
The United States amongst adults.
Um,

768
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,800
I think I eat a lot more than that,
but,

769
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,700
but you trained but you train and you 
have a higher lean body mass.

770
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,893
So that's,
that's,

771
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,190
that's fine.
Now some people,

772
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:35,700
yeah,
we,

773
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,450
that's a whole other rabbit hole.
Um,

774
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,990
the,
if you,

775
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,650
if you start adding sodas in which 
aren't satiating at all,

776
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:45,960
they don't positively affect your hunger
hormones.

777
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,143
Uh,
but you continue your same normal food 

778
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,370
intake.
Boom.

779
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,840
I mean,
you can start to store,

780
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,620
right?
Yeah.

781
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,510
So,
but I can't tell somebody,

782
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,613
hey,
there's no way you can lose weight and 

783
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:58,800
drink a soda because that's not true.
Um,

784
00:36:59,130 --> 00:36:59,963
there was a study done by a servlet and 
they looked at high-glycemic a diet 

785
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,080
versus low glycemic,
and I mean extreme.

786
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,093
They did a,
one group had over 100 grams of sugar a 

787
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:13,710
day.
Another group had a 10 grams or less per

788
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:17,610
day are sorry,
it was 11 grams or less per day and they

789
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,140
looked at the differences in weight 
loss,

790
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,700
blood lipids,
all that kind of stuff.

791
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,603
Did that everyday for carbohydrates.
So the group that ate 10 grams of sugar 

792
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:29,460
or less a day to day eat the same amount
of total carbohydrates,

793
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,730
same amount of total carbs.
Okay.

794
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:31,564
So low-glycemic versus high-glycemic 
processed carbs can spike your glucose 

795
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:35,910
more than sugar.
Right?

796
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,220
So they did have a fire at higher fiber 
intake.

797
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,020
But what the.
Well,

798
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,110
they did find that they had a higher 
insulin responses to the meal.

799
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:45,870
The high sugar group did,
but no differences in weight loss.

800
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,010
So they,
both,

801
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,840
both groups lost weight.
Uh,

802
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,810
the only real difference was the,
the,

803
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,180
the lower glycemic group had a little 
bit better.

804
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,400
Both groups improved,
improved cholesterol.

805
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,563
The lower glycemic group had just a 
little bit better improvement probably 

806
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:01,764
because they were eating higher fiber,
which can bind cholesterol and you 

807
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,614
excrete it.
I would like to see what happened if 

808
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:05,994
they equated.

809
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,080
So again,
it's,

810
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,670
it's creating that calorie deficit.
Both groups lost weight.

811
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,533
Now is it more difficult to create a 
calorie deficit if you're eating a lot 

812
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:18,480
of sugar?
Yes.

813
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,523
Okay.
So I always tell people your diet is 

814
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:24,660
like a budget if you're practicing 
something like flexible dieting.

815
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,733
Right?
So if I've got somebody like myself who 

816
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:28,674
has above average muscle mass,
hopefully I can say that people on the 

817
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:35,720
Internet probably going to do is wear a 
shirt with his name on it.

818
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,460
So.
Okay,

819
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,660
I'll say it.
You have above average muscle mass.

820
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,770
Thank you.
You're welcome.

821
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,653
So,
so if you have above average last 

822
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:46,090
semester,
you train hard,

823
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,983
you have a faster metabolism naturally.
I mean I've seen people who could 

824
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:50,650
maintain their body weight on six,
7,000

825
00:38:50,651 --> 00:38:53,830
calories a day.
You have a higher metabolic rate,

826
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,190
you have a really big budget.
So if you make $100,000,000

827
00:38:57,191 --> 00:38:58,024
a year,
is it a big deal for you to go out and 

828
00:38:58,841 --> 00:38:59,674
buy a $500,000
sports car if you can still pay your 

829
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:04,120
mortgage and pay all the other 
requirements that you have?

830
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,290
No,
it's fine.

831
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,660
But if you make 80 grand a year,
should you go out and buy a $500,000

832
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,320
sports car?
Probably not.

833
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,213
Right?
And if you make 30 you should be on 

834
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:14,600
Nikita.
Done.

835
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,000
Well you'd have increased for 
deficiency.

836
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:23,190
So it's the same thing.
So like people up.

837
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,063
So pop tarts somehow became the model of
the flexible dieting movement because 

838
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:27,964
people were,
here's why it's Kinda like 

839
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,220
counterculture.
So pop tart zealots out there.

840
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,540
It's like,
so whenever you have.

841
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,120
So clean eating became a thing amongst 
bodybuilding's,

842
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,050
we say eat clean even though there's no 
objective,

843
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,410
there's no objective definition of that.
Um,

844
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,890
so people were like,
Oh yeah,

845
00:39:44,891 --> 00:39:47,050
well I'm getting shredded night pop tart
everyday.

846
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,710
Right?
So a lot of your followers do that.

847
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,640
They do now.
Now I don't even like pop tarts.

848
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:56,260
He'd be honest.
Did you start this?

849
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:56,741
No,
no,

850
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:57,870
no.
It's not,

851
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,710
I don't know who else.
Hang on,

852
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:00,544
let me,
let me put the context of this so it's 

853
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:04,000
more about people saying,
hey,

854
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,820
I can still eat these foods I enjoy and 
I'm still losing weight because I'm with

855
00:40:07,821 --> 00:40:07,960
it.

856
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm in a calorie deficit and I'm hitting
my protein,

857
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:10,834
carb and fat targets,
but if you're somebody with a slow 

858
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:16,990
metabolism and you're not exercising 
very much and maybe all you're eating is

859
00:40:16,991 --> 00:40:20,740
100 grams of carbs a day,
should you spend 75 grams of those carbs

860
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:22,750
on two pop tarts?
Hell No.

861
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,673
That's a terrible idea because you're 
not going to be able to hit your other 

862
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:27,640
micronutrients and those sorts of 
things,

863
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,460
but if you're eating 4,000
calories,

864
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:34,180
like an Alberto Nunez friend of ours,
if you're eating 4,000

865
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,830
calories,
date and losing weight,

866
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,260
is it a big deal?
If he has to pop tarts?

867
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,250
Not really because he actually had one 
competitor.

868
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,383
Again,
a competitor who had such a fast 

869
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:49,831
metabolism that he was actually having a
lot of gi dysfunction because he,

870
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,340
he,
he,

871
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,173
he was eating like 700 grams of carbs in
200 grams of fat per day just to 

872
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:56,650
maintain his weight and he said,
I,

873
00:40:56,651 --> 00:40:58,780
I,
I feel bloated all the time.

874
00:40:58,930 --> 00:40:59,470
And I said,
well,

875
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,030
what are you eating?
Like what are your foods?

876
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,530
And it was chicken,
rice and Broccoli,

877
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,960
and I said,
it's a peanut butter for fats.

878
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:05,741
And I'm like,
well,

879
00:41:05,741 --> 00:41:08,290
no wonder dude,
you're having 150 grams of fiber a day.

880
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,133
You're literally full of Shit.
Like your shit is like literally backed 

881
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:13,000
up to your esophagus.
Okay.

882
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,950
So I said,
do me a favor,

883
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,930
eats and pizza,
eat some pop tarts,

884
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,160
eat some more calorically dense foods 
and see how you felt for three days.

885
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,020
He emailed me after three days,
he was like,

886
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,550
man,
I feel so much better.

887
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,773
I dropped like three pounds.
I feel amazing because he doesn't make 

888
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:31,630
any sense because he got fired.
The pop tart generation.

889
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,130
Uh,
he also inspired and I watched this play

890
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,080
out online and she sounded really bad.
Well,

891
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,303
lane actually inspired a generation of 
drug free bodybuilders to go and do 

892
00:41:43,191 --> 00:41:44,690
their phds,
you know,

893
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:47,420
and uh,
actually one's in my lab right now,

894
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,770
man,
student Andrew for a little while.

895
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,730
Yeah,
amazing student and I think he,

896
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:56,420
he learned a lot just from watching lane
or so,

897
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:57,620
uh,
but I think,

898
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,833
you know,
that it was amazing to see these guys 

899
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:01,694
eating that amount of pop tarts and junk
foods and Bob and I learned a lot from 

900
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:06,170
that,
but I think they could do it with,

901
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,580
with better carbohydrates.
So.

902
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:12,350
So what works for performance,
what works for bodybuilding may not be,

903
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,500
is probably not optimal for longevity 
and health.

904
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,110
So that's an important point.
You know,

905
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,720
lean winds.
I,

906
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,520
yeah,
the audio is okay.

907
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:27,350
So I know where he's coming from,
but you know,

908
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,670
I'd like to hear his opinion.

909
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,130
Yeah.
So before you do that,

910
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,470
why do you think that it would be an 
issue?

911
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,850
What would be the issue with sugar and 
with pop tarts and junk food?

912
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,780
What will be the negative effects?
Biologic?

913
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:41,614
I think the accumulation of the Post 
Prandial spikes in glucose and insulin 

914
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,173
over time,
especially in the context of a calorie 

915
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:51,680
surplus,
could be a bad thing.

916
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,110
If you are doing a calorie surplus to 
example,

917
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,110
for example,
to gain weight and mass over time,

918
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,640
which bodybuilders do following contest 
in the off season,

919
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:01,923
uh,
I think it's even more important almost 

920
00:43:04,131 --> 00:43:04,964
to actually stick with foods,
carbohydrate sources that are lower 

921
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:11,430
glycemic.
You know,

922
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,283
you can only tolerate so much fiber.
But I think if you are running a 

923
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:18,740
calories or if you are doing a ketogenic
diet and you have a calorie surplus,

924
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,610
that could be a bad thing.
Your triglycerides,

925
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:21,710
your triglycerides will go up.

926
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:22,783
So you are,
you're putting too much fat in the 

927
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:26,480
system and that what it would go up on a
higher carb diet,

928
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,360
higher carb diet too.
So,

929
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:32,450
I mean I kind of would stay along the 
lines of maybe protein,

930
00:43:32,451 --> 00:43:34,160
but you just,
you titrate it in,

931
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,630
in a reasonable amount.
But I just think that the negative,

932
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,033
you know,
that could come out of that is that 

933
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,260
you're,
you know,

934
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,950
I'm following a blood glucose curve,
right?

935
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:47,270
And insulin curve,
and,

936
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:49,520
and I see this very dramatically,
for example,

937
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,210
my student who is a type one diabetic,
Andrew [inaudible],

938
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,453
who's in and he wears a Dexcom 
continuous blood glucose monitoring 

939
00:43:56,631 --> 00:43:57,464
system and his insulin requirements 
dramatically dropped with low carb and 

940
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:05,990
his glucose fluctuations dramatically 
improved.

941
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:10,550
And that's going to pay big dividends 
probably if you have type one diabetes,

942
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,570
you ever,
you know,

943
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,300
the 10 top things,
uh,

944
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,960
on,
on how humans die,

945
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,540
you have a greater risk for every one of
those,

946
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,643
you know,
dramatic cuts 10 years off your life if 

947
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,340
the tighter you can keep your glucose 
levels,

948
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:26,174
your blood glucose and your insulin 
levels that in the long run I feel it's 

949
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:29,220
going to pay.

950
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,620
Big Science still has to show that

951
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,590
I think it's not totally clear,
uh,

952
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,640
but I think we can for type one 
diabetics,

953
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:40,680
which I think we can apply that data to 
the,

954
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:43,290
to the population if they control their 
glucose levels,

955
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,560
that pays big dividends in the long run 
lane.

956
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,420
So a couple things.
Yes.

957
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,270
You touched on a couple of points I was 
going to bring up,

958
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,470
but I want to address one thing first,
which is a,

959
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:58,080
the higher post Prandial insulin in 
those negative effects on health.

960
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,570
Um,
so if you have,

961
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,030
they've done studies on this,
on BMI versus insulin.

962
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,270
Now Bmi as a,
we can debate about how useful a measure

963
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:07,104
it is,
but in general it reflects body fat in 

964
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:10,310
the average population,
not lifters,

965
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,780
but in the average BMI,
by the way,

966
00:45:12,781 --> 00:45:13,614
for people who are listening is a ratio 
of your height versus your weight that 

967
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:19,290
generally reflects obesity and you're 
obese.

968
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,380
I'm so,
if you lift weights,

969
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,680
I'm morbidly obese.
It seems so silly.

970
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,813
It is.
But if you look at the general 

971
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:30,690
population who doesn't exercise,
it's actually pretty darn accurate.

972
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,230
Um,
gets factored into your insurance,

973
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:39,410
which is not as it relates to your can 
look at you and say some bs.

974
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,970
Some insurances will do like a waist to 
chest measurement,

975
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:42,751
which,
which helps,

976
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:46,500
but anyway,
so post Prandial Insulin,

977
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,393
they've looked at the relationship 
between people who have their BMS and 

978
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:51,204
post prandial insulin.
They find that people with higher BMI 

979
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,233
have higher post Prandial insulin,
but the opposite relationship does not 

980
00:45:57,091 --> 00:46:00,000
hold true for people who have higher 
insulin,

981
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:03,510
do not necessarily have higher bmi and 
they've done this in med analysis.

982
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:04,643
So what that says is again,
that if you are obese type two diabetic 

983
00:46:08,491 --> 00:46:09,324
metabolic syndrome profile,
that you will have elevated levels of 

984
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:12,534
insulin because your body's becoming 
insensitive to it because of all the 

985
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:16,584
dysfunction that we talked about,
but just because you secrete higher 

986
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:22,770
insulin doesn't mean that you're going 
to have more body fat.

987
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:23,603
And there was a study done actually by 
one of the proponents of the 

988
00:46:25,471 --> 00:46:29,770
carbohydrate insulin hypothesis,
um,

989
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:30,743
that looked at what's called Mendelian 
randomization where basically the idea 

990
00:46:34,921 --> 00:46:37,770
is you have different gene variants like
we were talking about.

991
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,130
And if,
for example,

992
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,780
like they've done this with ldl 
cholesterol are.

993
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:44,940
Sorry,
yes,

994
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,893
ldl cholesterol.
We believe most people believe the ldl 

995
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:50,430
cholesterol has some contribution 
towards heart disease.

996
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,860
It's a pretty,
I would say it's a pretty strong now.

997
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:57,861
People can over controversial text 
dependent and individual.

998
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,300
When they look at these,
these gene variants,

999
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,150
people who have gene variants where they
run lower ldl,

1000
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,570
have lower rates of heart disease,
people who are higher heart rates.

1001
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:12,150
If you look at that with insulin at 
best,

1002
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,420
insulin explains 10 percent of obesity 
at absolute best and that study actually

1003
00:47:18,571 --> 00:47:22,020
showed that high level of bias.
It was between one to 10 percent.

1004
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:25,740
So we're not,
I'm not putting out the,

1005
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,593
the idea that maybe insulin has some 
effect talking about fasting or post 

1006
00:47:29,831 --> 00:47:30,280
Prandial

1007
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,270
insulin.
Oh,

1008
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,830
overall,
overall,

1009
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,080
I,
I'm guessing probably more so fasting.

1010
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,770
How did they measure insulin?
I mean we,

1011
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,230
we have hemoglobin h,
one c for like uh,

1012
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:42,030
you know,
so there was another unit that,

1013
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:42,993
there was another med analysis where 
they looked at a higher carb versus 

1014
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,290
lower carb diets,
equating calories,

1015
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:53,560
looking at Hba one c and saw that.
So the,

1016
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,473
the differences in weight loss,
we're no different like we've discussed 

1017
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,980
when calories are acquainted,
but also the differences in Hba.

1018
00:47:59,981 --> 00:48:02,110
One C reduction were different.
They were the same.

1019
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,873
Now you asked about health and you know,
consuming some of these quote unquote 

1020
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:08,464
bad foods.
If you do it in the but you said in the 

1021
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:12,910
context of a caloric surplus,
right,

1022
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,300
which is the important thing because 
they helped to create a surplus,

1023
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,840
but in a deficit that what's the 
downside?

1024
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,420
Because kind of when you talk to people 
who were not,

1025
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:23,423
not ketogenic necessarily,
but proponents of quote unquote clean 

1026
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:26,164
eating,
which again has no real objective 

1027
00:48:27,761 --> 00:48:30,310
definition when you say,
okay,

1028
00:48:30,311 --> 00:48:31,920
well a pop tart,
maybe you can lose weight up,

1029
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:32,890
it can't be good for you.

1030
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,520
Okay,
well then we have to have some objective

1031
00:48:36,521 --> 00:48:38,410
measurement to show this by,
right?

1032
00:48:38,411 --> 00:48:40,900
Like because otherwise it's.
Do you believe in magic?

1033
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:44,230
Okay,
so if you look at processed foods,

1034
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:45,064
what they have found with processed 
foods is that you have a lower energy 

1035
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:49,150
expenditure from them.
Okay,

1036
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,970
so you have a certain amount of what we 
call t e,

1037
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:51,804
f thermic effective food.
A higher protein has a higher t f than 

1038
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:57,280
carbohydrate and fat.
Okay?

1039
00:48:57,281 --> 00:48:58,114
So we know the higher protein diets 
actually cause more weight loss and 

1040
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:00,844
better lean body mass protection.
Part of that is through the increase 

1041
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:06,610
thermogenesis of,
of the TF thermic effect of food.

1042
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,230
Well,
with processed foods,

1043
00:49:08,231 --> 00:49:09,064
you have a lower tef okay,
but that doesn't mean you can't eat any 

1044
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,550
processed foods and,
and lose weight you can eat,

1045
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,080
just means you might have to eat a 
little bit lower calories overall.

1046
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,153
Does that make sense?

1047
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,800
There was a key to genic pop tart and it
was made with,

1048
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:27,150
with almond tastes like shit.
We know that if we amens were probably,

1049
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,023
you know,
other nuts or things just given an 

1050
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:31,000
example,
you know,

1051
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:35,730
we don't fully digest,
assimilate and utilize those calories.

1052
00:49:35,731 --> 00:49:38,880
They pass through us.
So with the pop tart,

1053
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,070
uh,
I think it's pretty high with like raw,

1054
00:49:41,071 --> 00:49:41,904
like,
like a salad with nuts and things like 

1055
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:44,274
that.
Like it becomes significant over time 

1056
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,063
with the pop tart,
like you can basically 100 percent of 

1057
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:54,291
that is going into your system and it's 
causing a hormonal response.

1058
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,493
So the food that we eat creates is not 
only calories but creates a hormonal 

1059
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:02,543
response and also from the brain 
perspective can change the 

1060
00:50:04,591 --> 00:50:06,180
neuropharmacology of your brain.
I mean,

1061
00:50:06,181 --> 00:50:07,014
that's how I got into the key to genic 
diet because it fundamentally changes 

1062
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:12,420
neurotransmitter systems and reward 
systems.

1063
00:50:12,421 --> 00:50:13,950
And things like that,
right,

1064
00:50:13,951 --> 00:50:15,180
but hormones,

1065
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,713
people get so hung up on hormones and 
and if you look at the research data 

1066
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,850
just doesn't support it.
Like with Insula,

1067
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:22,684
whatnot.
Now in terms of like losing weight and 

1068
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:25,324
you're,
you're what happens with Leptin and 

1069
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:28,430
Ghrelin and all those kinds of things.
That is a huge.

1070
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,520
One of the.
One of the things we talked about before

1071
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,413
the podcast started,
we had about a 30 minute podcast and we 

1072
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:37,450
did actually,
you know,

1073
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,293
people say things like,
one of the reasons people are really 

1074
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:41,084
mistrustful of kind of the calories in 
calories out model is because it is 

1075
00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:49,820
viewed as a to isolated variables,
calories in,

1076
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:52,220
calories out or separate.
That's not true.

1077
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,530
Calories in effects.
Calories out.

1078
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:56,900
Okay.
There are a moving target.

1079
00:50:56,901 --> 00:50:57,734
So people will say,
well I ate in a calorie deficit and I 

1080
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:00,530
didn't lose weight.
No,

1081
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,393
you ate and what you thought was a 
calorie deficit and you didn't lose 

1082
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:05,360
weight,
but if you didn't lose weight,

1083
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,300
it was not a calorie deficit by 
definition.

1084
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:10,910
Okay.
So retaining water or something.

1085
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:14,480
Yeah.
Who's when we look at dieting,

1086
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,200
like just dieting in general over time 
lowers your metabolic rate,

1087
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,510
right?
So if you take somebody,

1088
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:22,190
they actually did a rat study.
Again,

1089
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,083
rats,
but rats tend to respond pretty similar 

1090
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:25,874
to humans into.
Would you agree with that in terms of 

1091
00:51:26,811 --> 00:51:27,320
blood?
I mean,

1092
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,930
you do a lot of rats,
rats and mouse studies.

1093
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:30,740
Uh,
yeah,

1094
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,140
I,
I think there's a lot of overlap there.

1095
00:51:33,141 --> 00:51:33,974
Yeah,
they're good model.

1096
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:35,323
So again,
when we have to put that out there 

1097
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:38,540
because we want to,
we don't want to oversell it.

1098
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,433
They did A.
depends on the context of what you're 

1099
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:42,080
studying.
Of course,

1100
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,640
like you don't want it to be like animal
studies can be helpful,

1101
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:50,480
but you don't want to do like an insulin
study in cows because cows are ruminants

1102
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,720
in there.
They don't care about insulin anyway,

1103
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,040
they took rats,
they took them to,

1104
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:56,090
to diet cycles.

1105
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,163
Okay.
So this is kind of back to the Yoyo 

1106
00:51:58,430 --> 00:51:59,970
dieting thing.
Um,

1107
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,853
and they looked at okay and they took 
obese rats of them down to a kind of 

1108
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:06,223
normal level than they,
than they basically gave him as much 

1109
00:52:08,361 --> 00:52:09,194
food as they want to let him eat back to
the original obese level dye to them 

1110
00:52:13,161 --> 00:52:16,550
down again to the previous level.
And then let him read back up.

1111
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,770
What they found was absolutely 
astonishing.

1112
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:19,933
There are food efficiency with so far up
because their metabolic rate became 

1113
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:24,200
suppressed every time they died.
It down.

1114
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:27,590
Your body has this self defense system 
that you activate every time you dye it.

1115
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:29,840
I talk about this in my shameless plug 
book.

1116
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,340
Um,
so the first time they died,

1117
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,510
if that's the kind of one times rate 
that they lost a fat ass,

1118
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,233
when they let them regain it,
they regained it twice as fast as they 

1119
00:52:40,851 --> 00:52:41,660
lost it.

1120
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,370
Then the second time they tried to lose 
it,

1121
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,930
they lost it at half the original rate.
Then when they regained it,

1122
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,853
the second time they gave you gained it 
three times as fast their food 

1123
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,650
efficiency would weigh up the ability to
lose it.

1124
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,000
Have you noticed?
Have you noticed?

1125
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:56,990
Well,
what's that?

1126
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,950
Lucid get faster as well.
No,

1127
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:01,993
no.
They took him twice as long to lose the 

1128
00:53:04,221 --> 00:53:05,650
same amount of weight.
Sorry,

1129
00:53:05,651 --> 00:53:07,610
I probably didn't explain it very well.
Yeah,

1130
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:08,444
I took him twice as long to lose the 
same amount of weight and they regained 

1131
00:53:10,131 --> 00:53:10,964
it in a third the time of the original.
So your body's getting accustomed to 

1132
00:53:14,181 --> 00:53:15,710
famine.
Exactly.

1133
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:16,603
Because every time you diet it,
and we see this with yo Yo dieters who 

1134
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:19,994
spend.
How many people do you know that seemed 

1135
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:24,620
to be perpetually on a diet,
but they just had that short overfeeding

1136
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,530
period in between diets underneath.

1137
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,293
It really does because every time you 
died you're activating your body self 

1138
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:34,650
defense system.
How many fighters do you know that every

1139
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:37,080
time they die it gets harder and harder 
for them to make weight.

1140
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:38,780
While they're doing more than that,
they're.

1141
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:41,520
They're cutting weight.
The cutting weight is ruthless.

1142
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:43,590
They're essentially almost dying.
Right?

1143
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:46,920
But part of that is there.
They're having to crash diet super low.

1144
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:48,630
So what is the signal you're telling 
your body?

1145
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,730
Because you have to always think about 
things.

1146
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:54,630
From an evolutionary perspective.
My Phd advisor was great about this,

1147
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,580
he'd always asked his name,
was Dr Don Lemon,

1148
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,860
brilliant guy,
and he would say,

1149
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:01,410
why do you think the body did this?
Well,

1150
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:02,244
if you think about what are the 
regulatory mechanisms of becoming fat 

1151
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,610
versus becoming too thin?
Right?

1152
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:11,340
So one,
one danger is you starve to death.

1153
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,580
The other danger is you get so fat that 
a Predator can come get you,

1154
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:18,180
which is more dangerous in the last 
20,000

1155
00:54:18,181 --> 00:54:19,160
years.
It's family,

1156
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:21,043
it's family.
So your body creates much tighter 

1157
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,550
defense system there.
So when you diet,

1158
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,230
your metabolic rate slows way down.
I mean if you've,

1159
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,083
you've ever these guys who cut weight,
so by the time they're ready to get a 

1160
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,820
fight,
for example,

1161
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,660
their metabolic rates really slow.
Then what happens after they fight,

1162
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,900
they eat a crap ton of food because 
they're there,

1163
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:44,640
they're Grelin is way up,
Leptin is way down,

1164
00:54:44,641 --> 00:54:47,670
insulin is way down and they regain it 
really fast.

1165
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,510
Now,
what

1166
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,120
to assume?
Just to interject that if you die it for

1167
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:54,950
16 weeks for a show,
for example,

1168
00:54:54,951 --> 00:54:55,784
or a contest that what you actually 
educated me in like 10 years ago and I 

1169
00:55:00,651 --> 00:55:04,640
thought there was this like post contest
rebound and in two weeks there'd be this

1170
00:55:04,641 --> 00:55:07,580
anabolic window or whatever for fat.
It actually,

1171
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:10,550
if you die hard for 16 weeks to make 
way,

1172
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,473
it takes an equal amount of time to get 
your metabolism back actually to that 

1173
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:15,314
level.
Again,

1174
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,720
maybe d.
So lane coined the term,

1175
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,220
right?
Reverse dieting river,

1176
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:23,120
I don't know if I call,
I pointed it and did this with metabolic

1177
00:55:23,121 --> 00:55:23,954
chambers and in rats.
And then use a variety of different 

1178
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:29,650
approaches to determine how fast it,
it actually takes to,

1179
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:31,770
uh,
to bring your metabolism backup.

1180
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:35,840
And if different strategies can be used 
to ramp up your metabolism,

1181
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,720
well,
because when you regain it,

1182
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:43,090
you regain fat really quickly,
but your metabolic rate is more sluggish

1183
00:55:43,091 --> 00:55:43,924
to return.
So they actually did a study with the 

1184
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:46,623
biggest loser participants.
And this is why I'm so big on what is 

1185
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:51,280
sustainable that it has to be 
sustainable.

1186
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,060
They looked at um,
so they last on average,

1187
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:58,690
like a quite a bit of weight,
I can't remember the exact numbers,

1188
00:55:58,691 --> 00:55:59,524
but they lost a bunch of weight over the
30 weeks because they starve them and 

1189
00:56:01,781 --> 00:56:02,614
they exercised the crap out of them and 
they saw that their metabolic rate 

1190
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:08,913
dropped 500 calories more than you would
predict just by the amount of body fat 

1191
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,123
and lean body mass they lose.
This is what's called metabolic 

1192
00:56:16,571 --> 00:56:17,404
adaptation.
When you defined the metabolic rate 

1193
00:56:18,911 --> 00:56:20,210
dropping,
what do you mean by that?

1194
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,190
What's the.
So?

1195
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:24,220
So you have.
So we can calculate all this stuff.

1196
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,530
So your overall total daily energy 
expenditure,

1197
00:56:26,531 --> 00:56:29,590
you're tde is made up of your basal 
metabolic rate,

1198
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:30,603
which is what you burn.
Like what we're doing right now just 

1199
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:34,780
sitting around doing oxygen consumption 
car to production.

1200
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:39,730
I actually actually to be real,
it's just laying down doing nothing.

1201
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:41,770
So basically the energy you burn keeping
the lights on,

1202
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,360
right?
That's one component.

1203
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:45,670
It's about 50 to 60 percent in most 
people.

1204
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:48,760
Then you have your neat,
which is like this,

1205
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:51,520
like I'm moving my hands,
I'm ambulatory movement,

1206
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:52,354
non voluntary movement.
This stuff will actually go down when 

1207
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:56,860
you diet,
like if you've ever been around,

1208
00:56:56,861 --> 00:56:58,150
people will go down.
Yes.

1209
00:56:58,151 --> 00:57:00,280
You stopped fidget.
Spontaneous movement goes down.

1210
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:04,180
It's a huge modifier.
So like if you look at either the DVD,

1211
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:06,040
when I was prepping for a show back in 
2010,

1212
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:09,250
I blink slower.
I'm not kidding.

1213
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:10,600
You and I talk slower.

1214
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:13,270
Yeah.
Mind you were like on volume.

1215
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,160
It looks like you're.
You're right.

1216
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:18,400
Now I'm all hyped up on in the life of 
lane with that says,

1217
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,540
oh absolutely.
Like you're so your body,

1218
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:24,310
this is your body genic di would help 
you.

1219
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,680
So.
So when you think about.

1220
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,600
So there's neat.
That's that.

1221
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,790
Then your exercise activity,
which is intuitive,

1222
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:32,410
that's how many calories you burn 
exercising,

1223
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:34,120
and then there's what's called the 
thermic effect of food,

1224
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:34,954
which we already discussed.
How much energy required to get energy 

1225
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,030
out of food.
Okay.

1226
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:39,783
And all those add up to your total daily
energy expenditure and we can predict 

1227
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:47,920
based on equations how,
what your metabolic rate should be.

1228
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,173
So these people,
their metabolic rate was 500 calories a 

1229
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:51,904
day lower than it should have been.
Just based off the weight they lost 

1230
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:59,110
because if you lose muscle and lose fat,
you have less weight to carry around,

1231
00:57:59,200 --> 00:57:59,470
right?

1232
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,300
So your metabolic rate goes down just 
from that,

1233
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,670
but it goes down way more than it 
should.

1234
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:04,983
That is your.
The first prong of your body self 

1235
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:10,210
defense system to stop you from starving
yourself is to become more efficient.

1236
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,340
We hear the word efficiency and we 
think,

1237
00:58:12,341 --> 00:58:12,790
wow,
that's.

1238
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:15,850
That's a good thing.
Think about if your body fat levels were

1239
00:58:15,851 --> 00:58:18,490
a gas tank and you have.
You had a car,

1240
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,680
okay.
You would not want to be efficient,

1241
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,500
right?
You to have one of the old suburbans,

1242
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:24,130
it was like half a mile per gallon,
right?

1243
00:58:24,131 --> 00:58:26,470
You don't want the Prius because you can
go way longer.

1244
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:27,723
So going back to that study on rats,
they became so much more efficient with 

1245
00:58:30,821 --> 00:58:31,654
their food,
and this is the second prong of your 

1246
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:37,510
body is self defense system is to not 
only slow down your metabolic rate while

1247
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:38,344
you're dieting,
but to start activating systems that 

1248
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:42,160
deal with restoring.

1249
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,290
Once you actually start overeating 
again.

1250
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,633
Have you ever done a long diet or known 
somebody who did it and then they start 

1251
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:49,660
eating again?
It's like everything sticks to you.

1252
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,700
It's like you just.
It's like you like,

1253
00:58:51,701 --> 00:58:54,580
how did I gain five pounds from one day 
and people are like,

1254
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,443
oh,
it's water.

1255
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,283
Well,
water doesn't stay around for six 

1256
00:58:56,861 --> 00:58:57,694
months,
so it's not water that is your body 

1257
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:01,624
preparing all these systems,
so even like enzymes that deal with fat 

1258
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:05,194
storage while you're dieting actually go
up because it's preparing your body for 

1259
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:09,124
restoring and then even probably the 
most interesting thing is it all falls 

1260
00:59:13,811 --> 00:59:17,020
back on the importance of tracking 
Macros,

1261
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:17,883
which is completely ignored with guys 
coming off of a fight or fitness 

1262
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:26,180
competitors.
Let yourself blow up really quickly.

1263
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,470
It's a myth that your body is set up to 
be anabolic or to gain muscle.

1264
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,530
That is for your setup for fat.
Yeah,

1265
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:36,860
but the point I'm trying to make is that
the way most people diet,

1266
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:38,240
which is this kind of.
I mean,

1267
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,074
you know,
you've probably been around people who 

1268
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:42,050
do this stuff.
It's a lot of people,

1269
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:45,260
they they pick the next fad diet.
Whatever's popular,

1270
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,153
they do it,
they lose some weight and the navy gain 

1271
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:47,893
it.
My Dad lost 30 pounds on a ketogenic 

1272
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:51,410
diet,
regained 50 right now.

1273
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:55,190
The real problem is in the macros.
Now he does,

1274
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,710
but the real problem,
and he's down 50 pounds again,

1275
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:02,830
but the real problem is if we used to 
think adipose tissue is like a sponge,

1276
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,900
right?
So if you ate too much,

1277
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,940
you just threw more in there,
right?

1278
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:11,600
Soaked up extra nutrients,
and then if you started,

1279
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,640
if you're in a caloric deficit,
you were losing weight.

1280
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:15,980
It just gave up some of its nutrients.

1281
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,380
You know,
like the guy who fasted for 365 days and

1282
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:20,960
didn't die because he had so much,
so much fat.

1283
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:26,360
We now know that body fat fits every 
definition of a,

1284
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,670
of an inadequate system.
It's a tissue.

1285
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,810
It is an actual organ because it sends 
out hormonal signals,

1286
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,150
it integrates hormonal signals,
it talks to the brain,

1287
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:38,720
the Hindbrain,
the arcuate nucleus is integrated in all

1288
01:00:38,721 --> 01:00:43,220
of metabolism in a big way,
and typically you have.

1289
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:46,820
The way we gain fat,
lose fat is based on the fat cell size.

1290
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:50,120
So you have a set number of fat cells 
and the other expand,

1291
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:50,983
or they shrink pretty intuitive,
unless now you can create more fat 

1292
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:56,474
cells.
If you become so obese that you 

1293
01:00:58,341 --> 01:00:59,990
literally can't stuff any more fat in 
there,

1294
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:01,063
right?
So obese people have fat cell 

1295
01:01:02,601 --> 01:01:06,410
hyperplasia.
A lot of times what's really interesting

1296
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:08,600
is people at the end of a diet when 
your,

1297
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:09,763
when your thyroid hormone is lower,
your sympathetic nervous system tone is 

1298
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:12,770
lower.

1299
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:14,330
This unique hormonal.
May Lou,

1300
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,930
if you overfeed to rapidly,
there's a researcher named Mclean out of

1301
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:18,764
Colorado that actually showed that you 
can actually increase your fat cell 

1302
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:25,310
number if you overfeed to rapidly right 
after a diet.

1303
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:26,990
Now,
this was in rats,

1304
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:31,190
full disclosure,
but it was fascinating stuff.

1305
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,133
Now you're increasing your body's,
but it makes sense from an evolutionary 

1306
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:37,880
perspective.
Your body's like,

1307
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,380
shit,
we had this famine.

1308
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:40,730
We don't want to deal with this shit 
again.

1309
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:43,310
We want to make sure that we can store 
as much stuff as possible,

1310
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,970
so we're going to create some new.
This dude is rapidly overfeeding.

1311
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:49,700
We're going to create some new fat cells
to make sure we're not going to miss any

1312
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:50,534
of this energy.
We're going to capture every single bit 

1313
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:51,740
of it.

1314
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,220
I like what you're saying and it makes a
lot of sense.

1315
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,440
You're talking about weight loss and 
weight gain,

1316
01:01:56,441 --> 01:01:57,274
but you were specifically discussing 
hormonal changes in the body due to the 

1317
01:02:00,521 --> 01:02:01,354
ketogenic diet that are beneficial and 
that these hormonal changes and the 

1318
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:05,854
changes to the way the brain functions 
would be a benefit of following that 

1319
01:02:10,241 --> 01:02:13,120
diet versus just working on calories.

1320
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,673
Yeah,
I mean it's at that book I gave you the 

1321
01:02:15,971 --> 01:02:18,550
complete book of Ketones by Dr Marion.

1322
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,180
So,
uh,

1323
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,413
so that,
I don't think it's actually out yet 

1324
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:28,600
because prep guide going to get jacked.
So ketones are hints of Beta.

1325
01:02:29,891 --> 01:02:31,140
There a,
a,

1326
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,353
there are sort of,
by definition have a metabolic 

1327
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:38,580
superiority as a,
as a fuel source,

1328
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:39,743
you know,
and they readily cross the blood brain 

1329
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:41,634
barrier.
They can largely replace glucose as the 

1330
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:44,334
primary energy source in your brain 
under periods of fasting a or ketogenic 

1331
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:49,440
diet.
So that,

1332
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:50,783
that offers a lot of advantages to 
someone dieting because it makes you 

1333
01:02:55,591 --> 01:02:58,200
resilient.
Like the guy that fast at 382 days,

1334
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:01,650
his glucose was,
was like 30 and dipped down the 20.

1335
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:04,380
That would be universally fatal for most
people.

1336
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:06,690
But as ketones were elevated,
so he did not feel hunger.

1337
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,360
So that,
that is true.

1338
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,790
Like the Cahill Studies,
George Cahill,

1339
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:15,060
a studies at Harvard medical school 
where they fasted subjects for 40 days,

1340
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:19,350
they injected insulin to increase what 
are,

1341
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:23,520
did two that I remember presenting this 
Atliens camp a while back.

1342
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:25,230
Uh,
and I,

1343
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,160
when I,
you know,

1344
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,380
read this study,
I had to call him on the phone,

1345
01:03:28,381 --> 01:03:30,480
he was living,
he passed away in 2012,

1346
01:03:30,481 --> 01:03:31,314
but we had a number of conversations 
before he passed away and I was amazed 

1347
01:03:34,501 --> 01:03:35,334
that he got ethics approval to do that 
because it's basically like killing 

1348
01:03:37,621 --> 01:03:38,454
someone injecting 20 I use of insulin.
But what was fascinating that they were 

1349
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:43,194
asymptomatic for hypoglycemia at a level
of hypoglycemia that's typically 

1350
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:48,183
universally fatal.
And they were also a very cognitively 

1351
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:54,720
lucid.
And that was a dramatic demonstration at

1352
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:56,340
the time it was thought that,
you know,

1353
01:03:56,490 --> 01:04:00,900
the brain could only use glucose.
So this is a paradigm shift in the way,

1354
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:01,963
uh,
we understand sort of fuel utilization 

1355
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:05,064
and particularly in the brain,
so that has major and I can go on and 

1356
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:11,190
talking about the different applications
of the Ketogenic Diet,

1357
01:04:11,191 --> 01:04:12,630
which I did on the first podcast.

1358
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:13,763
But from a perspective of someone 
dieting to lose weight dieting as a 

1359
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:21,270
lifestyle,
doing intermittent fasting,

1360
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:22,104
the key to genic diet makes intermittent
fasting much easier because your brains 

1361
01:04:24,451 --> 01:04:27,690
adapted to it.
That for me had tremendous,

1362
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:33,100
a practical applications that allowed me
to excel through academia.

1363
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:35,880
I was able to do a lot more work,
not get hungry.

1364
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,920
And uh,
and you know,

1365
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:39,990
Lena,
we haven't trained in a while,

1366
01:04:39,991 --> 01:04:42,930
but when we train last night we did dead
lifts.

1367
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:46,930
I mean we were doing both deadlifting 
six 75 for reps and I was on,

1368
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,150
actually,
I was on the,

1369
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,433
the,
uh,

1370
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:50,903
the classical ketogenic diet then that's
when I was just doing it and it out to 

1371
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,970
your school versus like an 80 to 90 
percent fat.

1372
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:00,180
And I was doing that for about a year 
and um,

1373
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:01,763
you know,
dead lifting like three times my body 

1374
01:05:03,001 --> 01:05:04,380
weight for,
for Reps,

1375
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,930
you know,
and it didn't hurt me.

1376
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:08,700
I can't say that would be the case for 
everyone,

1377
01:05:08,701 --> 01:05:13,020
but I also titrated the calories in that
I wasn't really at a calorie deficit.

1378
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:13,854
I lost a little bit of ways.
So I guess by definition I was at a 

1379
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:17,980
calorie deficit now for people that are

1380
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,830
thinking about gains,
trying to gain weight,

1381
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:23,140
they would think that the key to genic 
at that 80,

1382
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,240
90 percent fat would not be enough 
protein.

1383
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:30,300
I believe that the ketogenic diet shines
when you are in a calorie deficit.

1384
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:33,640
I,
my mentor for the cancer work,

1385
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:34,474
Tom Seyfried had published a study 
showing an unrestricted ketogenic diet 

1386
01:05:38,111 --> 01:05:41,380
can actually promote cancer growth in a 
brain tumor model.

1387
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,940
Unrestricted meaning too much calories.
Yeah.

1388
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:44,774
They were feeding mice a sugary at key 
to genic formula that was on the market 

1389
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:48,694
at the time.
Well,

1390
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:49,990
it was a sweetened.
I'm sorry.

1391
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:50,824
It was sweet and cute.
Agentic formula with hydrogenated fats 

1392
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:54,340
and other things.
Yeah,

1393
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:55,773
it was a,
as sweetened with maybe with aspartame 

1394
01:05:58,211 --> 01:05:59,044
or something like that,
so they might tend to overeat it and 

1395
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:02,770
when they overeat it,
you know,

1396
01:06:02,771 --> 01:06:07,590
it creates a plethora of metabolic 
abnormalities and uh,

1397
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:10,810
you also get those same mountain rallies
when you over eat carbs.

1398
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,220
You didn't say,
here's me being,

1399
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,593
just as a side note,
how much does it drive you guys crazy 

1400
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:19,370
when you hear about this fat acceptance 
thing or fat is healthy when you be fat.

1401
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:24,040
So much of this going around to 
massively obese people,

1402
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:26,110
they're trying to say it's okay,
it's fine.

1403
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:27,820
You're your football players,
right?

1404
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:30,250
I mean,
by definition they're pretty healthy.

1405
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:31,270
I mean they,
they lift,

1406
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:34,930
they train a metabolically,
their bloodwork kind of looks okay,

1407
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:35,823
so you have guts,
but they're not surprise you with my 

1408
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:39,544
answer.
Okay.

1409
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:40,870
Uh,
so,

1410
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:42,130
uh,
we talked about this earlier,

1411
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,050
I'll take the heat.
I'm a libertarian,

1412
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:44,973
so if somebody says I'm fat and unhappy 
and I liked my life and I know what the 

1413
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:52,060
risks are that I say,
knock yourself out.

1414
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,180
I've ended up before the judge will make
somebody else happy.

1415
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:57,850
But now the problem is if you complained
about being fat,

1416
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:58,773
that you got to do something about it,
otherwise you're not going to have any 

1417
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:01,420
patients for.

1418
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,450
That goes back to the discipline there,
but you can be fit,

1419
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:08,110
but fat that you.
Because you have morbidly obese people.

1420
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:08,944
Like I said,
if you lose 10 percent of your body 

1421
01:07:09,851 --> 01:07:10,684
weight,
there's overweight people who run 

1422
01:07:11,891 --> 01:07:13,780
marathons.
Texture.

1423
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,850
Yeah.
You can't tell me they're not in shape.

1424
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:16,640
Yeah,
no,

1425
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,473
know for sure.
It's just you're just carrying extra 

1426
01:07:18,671 --> 01:07:19,391
weight.
I mean,

1427
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:21,790
look at Daniel Cormier.
He's not obese.

1428
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,220
He's not obese,
but he has some fat.

1429
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:28,240
Don't come get me down.
I thought steep meo chick.

1430
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:29,223
He was more than 40 pounds over his 
fighting weight as a light heavyweight 

1431
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:33,424
champion and he was actually heavier 
than steep a bay and serves the 

1432
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,540
practical friend of mine.
But yeah,

1433
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:43,180
but that is.
The performance is not the same thing as

1434
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:44,014
aesthetics.
Let me tell you what it meant to shape 

1435
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:46,900
what I looked like.
That I looked amazing.

1436
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,660
You felt like shit.
I felt like shit ready to pass out.

1437
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,033
Literally for me to stand up was a.
was I remember being on the couch and 

1438
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:59,251
there was a stupid,
some show on [inaudible] dot com.

1439
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:00,383
Uh,
there was a stupid show on TV and the 

1440
01:08:02,501 --> 01:08:04,510
remote was,
this goes back to neat.

1441
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,510
There was a remote over there,
like five feet away.

1442
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:09,003
I sat and watched the whole show because
I just didn't feel like getting the 

1443
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:11,284
fucking remote.
So isn't it ironic because you look so 

1444
01:08:14,411 --> 01:08:15,980
good,
like when you jacked

1445
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,813
like that,
you look like you just fucking running 

1446
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,320
forever breakthrough walls.
Now there is a threshold,

1447
01:08:21,321 --> 01:08:22,154
like you know,
some of the Ray Williams who is the 

1448
01:08:23,811 --> 01:08:26,960
world's best power lifter.
I mean he looks obese,

1449
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,093
dude squats legit 180 pounds.
Isn't that an issue there with power 

1450
01:08:31,701 --> 01:08:32,534
lifter?
So a good percentage of them carrying 

1451
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:35,143
around a lot of body fat.
It's not as much as you would think 

1452
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:40,130
anymore like in the super heavyweight ts
because like for example,

1453
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:40,964
the IPF,
which is kind of the IOC recognized 

1454
01:08:42,711 --> 01:08:43,544
Power Lifting Federation that I compete 
in their cutoff for super heavy weights 

1455
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:47,714
to 65.
So if you're going to be a super 

1456
01:08:48,801 --> 01:08:51,200
heavyweight,
might as well just be 3:50,

1457
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:52,790
you know,
it was that Dude Jamie,

1458
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:57,320
that's ray as bets re re look at the bar
bending.

1459
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,370
Dude,
that's,

1460
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,970
he's a beast.
He's a beast,

1461
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:01,100
right?
Gentlemen,

1462
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:03,230
Super Nice Guy,
a blind sumner,

1463
01:09:03,231 --> 01:09:03,650
another one.

1464
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:07,600
But like when I sit my squat record of 
six 68 at 200,

1465
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:08,434
five pounds,
I mean I was in pretty good shape for 

1466
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:10,874
that,
but for me to get to like eight percent 

1467
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:13,454
body fat,
no problem for me to get from eight 

1468
01:09:15,201 --> 01:09:16,034
percent and I'm calibrating.
So for me to get to from eight percent 

1469
01:09:19,341 --> 01:09:22,690
to three percent,
so fucking nightmare your body again.

1470
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:27,140
Really get down to three on.
I think that would be if you floated.

1471
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:29,120
No,
there are no actual,

1472
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:31,250
uh,
accurate measures of body fat.

1473
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:32,084
That's the uh,
that's why it's not really like the 

1474
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:34,873
relatively within themselves.
They're activists dependent upon 

1475
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:39,290
hydration factors.
Yes.

1476
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:41,810
So people,
not to make too much of a side tangent,

1477
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:46,250
but people look at Dexa dual x Ray 
absorption technology and they say,

1478
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,420
oh,
that's the gold standard.

1479
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:51,700
Texas actually really finicky.
Like I remember Dec,

1480
01:09:51,701 --> 01:09:54,740
seeing rats in studies that we do it in 
duplicate,

1481
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,053
so we do it twice and sometimes you'd 
have like differences just decorating 

1482
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:00,620
the same rat twice.

1483
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,990
It depends on the machine,
your hydration status,

1484
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:04,490
because water,
if you want to gain,

1485
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:05,383
you know what the best way to gain eight
pounds of lean body mass within five 

1486
01:10:08,751 --> 01:10:10,490
minutes,
go do a Dexa,

1487
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:12,320
then drink a gallon of water,
go back to the next,

1488
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:13,670
another Dexa.
You'll be eight pounds.

1489
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:14,504
Lean body mass heavier.
You can impress your friends because 

1490
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:17,830
it's the two compartment model.
More lean body mass.

1491
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:20,000
It's a to compartment model.
Same thing with calipers.

1492
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:22,220
It's only measuring your amount of fat 
tissue.

1493
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:25,130
So anything that's not fat is lean body 
mass.

1494
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,710
So if you guys are using that to track 
progress,

1495
01:10:27,711 --> 01:10:28,544
if anybody use that to track progress,
it's only accurate relative to the 

1496
01:10:32,991 --> 01:10:33,824
measurement.
So your calipers me nothing for what 

1497
01:10:35,721 --> 01:10:37,840
your dexa measurements going to be and 
vice versa.

1498
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:39,830
I see it,
but the change,

1499
01:10:39,831 --> 01:10:40,664
like if I'm.
If I'm calibrating a consistently at 10 

1500
01:10:44,151 --> 01:10:44,984
percent and then it drops to eight and 
then seven and I can be relatively 

1501
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:50,270
confident that I'm losing body fat,
same thing for Dexa,

1502
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,190
but you have to do it at the same time 
of day,

1503
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:54,830
same hydration status,
all of that kind of stuff.

1504
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,530
And I don't really use dexhub because 
people,

1505
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,753
in order to get an accurate,
you'd have to use it like every day for 

1506
01:11:01,461 --> 01:11:03,920
it to be actual relative.
You use pictures,

1507
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:04,754
right?
So when he was dying and got to a 

1508
01:11:05,991 --> 01:11:08,780
certain way off tangent here,
but I looked at him as,

1509
01:11:08,781 --> 01:11:09,470
okay,
yeah,

1510
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:13,290
like stop there.
But then he would go for another and get

1511
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:14,124
to a level where

1512
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,780
he looked very gaunt.
I mean,

1513
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:19,530
you looked what looks good.
They're like seeing him in person.

1514
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,470
Like I need this personality was 
changing.

1515
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,910
I mean,
it's kind of Freaky,

1516
01:11:23,911 --> 01:11:25,650
disgusting.
Looking towards the end,

1517
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,053
uh,
and many people who maybe follow the 

1518
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:31,290
sport but don't compete,
don't really realize what the difference

1519
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:34,380
between five percent or six percent and 
three percent is.

1520
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:37,590
So that separates the competitors from 
the.

1521
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,753
That's your Bros online.
Really fighting evolution at that point 

1522
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:43,710
because your body is trying to,
your close to starvation,

1523
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,110
literally your body is trying to keep 
you from doing that,

1524
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,240
so like you think about food all the 
time,

1525
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:50,280
you actually become.
So a friend of mine,

1526
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:53,130
Chris Foster,
he's a professor at l a.

1527
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:56,820
He was doing his phd at the same time as
me and him.

1528
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,060
My other friend Dr Jeremy Lin and Dr 
Lindy Russo,

1529
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:03,030
Chris's wife Chris was doing a contest 
prep,

1530
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:07,560
but I prepped him for the show and it 
was a six months study of He's a natural

1531
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:08,403
bodybuilder,
so drug free and they looked at the 

1532
01:12:10,171 --> 01:12:12,000
hormonal responses,
his weight,

1533
01:12:12,001 --> 01:12:15,060
his body fat and even like measures of 
mood.

1534
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:16,283
Chris is like the most.
I was a beast like to 60 or I'm not a 

1535
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,260
natural joy free by 2:20
in the off season,

1536
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:25,220
but one day he just looked like he,
you know,

1537
01:12:25,221 --> 01:12:26,054
he's a big guy,
but he's like a very mellow dude by the 

1538
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:29,530
end.
His mood measurements.

1539
01:12:29,531 --> 01:12:31,080
We're measuring like that of a 
psychopath.

1540
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,290
Really?
Yeah.

1541
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:37,330
It just changes your mood around 
fighters who like they get when they get

1542
01:12:37,351 --> 01:12:38,184
that lean,
it's just like he could barely talk to 

1543
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:43,260
you and we'll think about.
Think about like they're actually trying

1544
01:12:43,261 --> 01:12:45,930
to peak for a fight at the same time.
They feel the most like shit.

1545
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:46,793
It's ridiculous.
They're so focused on cardio they want 

1546
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,120
to make to send to a.
they're.

1547
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:53,120
They're focused on just dehydration and 
making that way.

1548
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,370
I've seen some of the protocols.
I've.

1549
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:56,303
There's some good ones out there,
but some of the stuff I've seen them 

1550
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:58,021
like,
God,

1551
01:12:58,021 --> 01:13:01,830
I wish I could talk to somebody in that,
in that realm because it's so.

1552
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:03,210
It's so much bro.
Science,

1553
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:04,610
it's so dangerous to.
And it's.

1554
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,473
It's really,
you can only do it three or four times 

1555
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:09,690
and then your body starts to reject it 
and these guys have to go up and wait.

1556
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:10,720
Like you were talking about.
Well,

1557
01:13:10,721 --> 01:13:11,860
you explained to you why.
Yeah,

1558
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:12,881
it.
Guess what?

1559
01:13:12,881 --> 01:13:15,780
What happens when they go up a weight?
Sometimes they start crushing it.

1560
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:19,770
Do they do much better?
So it's testosterone right?

1561
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,780
At plummeted,
but his,

1562
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:25,720
his bazell requirements as calories 
department was like 1200.

1563
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,140
The crazy thing is I'm.
So,

1564
01:13:28,141 --> 01:13:28,974
there had been some critics of my,
my kind of a view of metabolic 

1565
01:13:32,131 --> 01:13:33,900
adaptation.
The body is self defense system,

1566
01:13:33,901 --> 01:13:36,210
full full disclosure.
Some people criticized me about that.

1567
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:37,230
They say,
well,

1568
01:13:37,231 --> 01:13:38,064
if you look at metabolic adaptation,
it only explains it's only a 15 percent 

1569
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:44,010
adaptation relative to the whole 
adaptation.

1570
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:47,010
And uh,
but if you look at Chris's numbers,

1571
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:47,993
I think on average that's probably right
on an average diet with an average 

1572
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:50,964
person you take,
somebody's trying to get really lean or 

1573
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:54,870
somebody who jojo diets or somebody 
crash diets.

1574
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,450
And now you know,
if again,

1575
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:58,403
it's proportionate.
If you challenge your body with 

1576
01:14:00,211 --> 01:14:01,044
something extreme,
it's going to respond in an extreme 

1577
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:03,234
fashion.
So every case study we have on natural 

1578
01:14:05,701 --> 01:14:06,534
bodybuilders and there's about 10 of 
them now who look at their contest 

1579
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:09,894
preparation and coming out of it.
And I use them to just because this is 

1580
01:14:11,591 --> 01:14:12,130
the realm I grew

1581
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:12,963
up in,
shows that they're hypogonadal by the 

1582
01:14:15,161 --> 01:14:15,994
time that they're at stage.
So hypogonadal meaning their 

1583
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:21,340
testosterone,
their testosterone is clinically low.

1584
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:22,750
Yeah,
naturally.

1585
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:24,800
And these are guys like me.
I actually run.

1586
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,940
I actually have a pretty naturally high 
testosterone level.

1587
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:30,310
Like when every.
Every time ever since I'm 16 years old,

1588
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:32,820
when I got tested,
I've been like over 800.

1589
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,380
If I'm eating enough.
When I was at contest,

1590
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,453
I was under 300.
This is part of how your body fights 

1591
01:14:39,161 --> 01:14:39,994
you.
Your body does not want you to be that 

1592
01:14:40,901 --> 01:14:41,734
lean,
but if you're kind of raining this back 

1593
01:14:44,711 --> 01:14:45,544
into the discussion,
this is why I talk about why it's so 

1594
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:50,920
important to pick something that's 
sustainable for you as an individual.

1595
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:52,023
Because if you do this shit where you 
Yoyo Diet or you don't come out of it 

1596
01:14:55,331 --> 01:14:57,850
appropriately,
it will fuck you up.

1597
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:58,720
I mean we've.

1598
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,440
We've all females,
especially in a lot of track record,

1599
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:03,293
like I,
I've worked with a lot of females now 

1600
01:15:04,721 --> 01:15:05,554
because especially in physique sports,
there's a lot of really bad coaching 

1601
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,800
starvation diets than for women.
It's,

1602
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:14,010
it just messes with their reproductive 
cycle to stop having peer mentors,

1603
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:16,203
which I'm going to and of itself doesn't
seem to have necessarily what does that 

1604
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:23,140
no menstrual cycle.
So it doesn't necessarily end of itself,

1605
01:15:23,141 --> 01:15:24,670
seemed to be a,
um,

1606
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:26,493
have negative health consequences in 
terms of longevity or disease or 

1607
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:30,580
anything like that.
But yeah,

1608
01:15:30,581 --> 01:15:33,820
I mean if you can't get pregnant,
I mean that's a big deal for some women,

1609
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:34,863
but the women don't want to hear is you 
may have to gain some body fat to get 

1610
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:38,680
that back.
You know,

1611
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,680
they don't want to hear that.
But this is why,

1612
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:46,450
like I really start with sustainability 
and then from there I go to,

1613
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:48,280
okay,
what?

1614
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,110
So if we've got what's sustainable for 
you now,

1615
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:52,180
can we get a little bit better?
Can we do a little bit more fiber?

1616
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:54,940
Like I think in general,
you know,

1617
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,133
I criticize Paleo diets because I think 
their validation for their model is 

1618
01:15:59,381 --> 01:16:02,560
absolutely fucking stupid.
Oh,

1619
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:03,423
the kind of evolutionary validation and 
the fact that we didn't drink milk and 

1620
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,500
we didn't eat beans in this kind of 
thing,

1621
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:10,053
but coffee.
But the question shouldn't be what we 

1622
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:13,054
were doing.
The question should be what makes sense 

1623
01:16:15,131 --> 01:16:17,950
and what is healthy now.
Like if you look at studies on dairy,

1624
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,230
almost all studies show people who take 
in dairy are healthier,

1625
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:25,360
better bone density,
more lean body mass,

1626
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:26,670
lower body fat.
But it isn't.

1627
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,750
Are there a lot of people that think 
that dairy is bad for you?

1628
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:30,370
Yeah.
Here it causes inflammation.

1629
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:32,190
Megan's but early,
uh,

1630
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:33,010
some,
some,

1631
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:33,843
some,
some like clean eaters to think that 

1632
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:37,530
dairy somehow causes the,
the research data.

1633
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:39,243
Yeah.

1634
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,800
In dairy,
uh,

1635
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:42,713
various proteins that a alpha locked 
albumin or that can basically initiate 

1636
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,130
a,
an immune response in the body.

1637
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,053
So I know when I'm okay with dairy fat,
I can get like 100 grams a day of dairy 

1638
01:16:54,781 --> 01:16:55,800
fat.
But if I'm,

1639
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:56,693
if I drink a whey protein shake,
especially at night I wake up all 

1640
01:16:58,831 --> 01:17:03,831
congested and pure whey concentrate a 
way.

1641
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:07,800
Yeah,
way concentrated or just like a,

1642
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:09,920
you know,
a yogurt or,

1643
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:12,170
and,
and I think it's a spectrum,

1644
01:17:12,171 --> 01:17:13,004
right?
So it's not like you have it or you 

1645
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:14,990
don't.
I think,

1646
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:19,730
you know,
there's a spectrum and bovine protein is

1647
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:24,400
kind of viewed a foreign body.
I mean once it enters the bloodstream it

1648
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:25,243
can.

1649
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,153
It's only if it enters the blood stream 
because if digestion is working 

1650
01:17:28,901 --> 01:17:29,734
properly,
you're not going to get any of that in 

1651
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:33,080
the bloodstream.
It's all going to be chewed up into some

1652
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:35,110
of the die and try peptides.
Some of it makes,

1653
01:17:35,111 --> 01:17:36,670
I mean like insulins have 15,

1654
01:17:36,670 --> 01:17:38,950
the amino acid and if you take enough 
insulin,

1655
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:42,310
like you can basically go hypoglycemic 
if you orally consume it.

1656
01:17:42,311 --> 01:17:43,440
That's why you,
I

1657
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,400
think it's a,
I think it's 81,

1658
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,640
81 I thought.
Oh well it doesn't matter.

1659
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:49,000
Sure.
Yeah,

1660
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,230
yeah.
Yeah.

1661
01:17:50,231 --> 01:17:55,231
So even something that's a 50 amino 
acids can get through this,

1662
01:17:56,321 --> 01:18:00,590
this term lactose intolerance.
Do you think that's actually resigning?

1663
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:02,250
That's actually sugar.
Yeah.

1664
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:06,030
So this is an issue with people's 
individual dietary system.

1665
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:06,893
Some people have a alpha elect,
albumin sensitive sensitivity where 

1666
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,990
they,
if they've got some kind of leaky gut.

1667
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:15,580
So normally your,
your,

1668
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:17,830
your injunctions are tight.
Okay.

1669
01:18:17,831 --> 01:18:19,210
So your,
your small intestine,

1670
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:22,000
your intestines are like kind of fingers
and they pick up nutrients.

1671
01:18:22,001 --> 01:18:23,890
This I'm really generalizing,
but theo cells,

1672
01:18:23,891 --> 01:18:27,890
the tight junction is a little little 
anchor that holds that gets loose,

1673
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:29,013
dysfunctional with that that can allow 
certain nutrients through the wall and 

1674
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:35,890
that will initiate a bodies in loon 
response.

1675
01:18:35,891 --> 01:18:40,891
Holly is a CELIAC and she.
So if she has gluten it you will know it

1676
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:44,170
because she will have a huge 
inflammatory response.

1677
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:46,690
But in people who have normal digestion,
that just doesn't happen.

1678
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:48,213
Going back to the Paleo thing,
what I was going to say is even though 

1679
01:18:51,071 --> 01:18:53,710
I.
I disagree with their relevance,

1680
01:18:53,711 --> 01:18:55,780
if you told me,
okay,

1681
01:18:55,781 --> 01:18:59,350
you take their general recommendations,
eat limit sugar,

1682
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,900
eat more whole foods,
eat higher protein.

1683
01:19:01,901 --> 01:19:05,170
I think in general that's pretty good 
recommendations for most people.

1684
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:06,700
I just,
as you said,

1685
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:07,534
I'm anti bullshit so I'm not going to 
let you make claims about why something 

1686
01:19:11,321 --> 01:19:12,154
works when that's not why it works.
So when we look at like the differences 

1687
01:19:16,661 --> 01:19:17,494
in diets,
like I think what I would say generally 

1688
01:19:19,331 --> 01:19:20,164
to pr people is that here's the great 
news as far as fat loss goes and health 

1689
01:19:25,211 --> 01:19:27,880
markers,
if you want to lose weight,

1690
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:31,090
if you eat,
if you control your calories,

1691
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:31,953
so a calorie deficit,
you eat enough protein because protein 

1692
01:19:34,631 --> 01:19:35,464
helps spare lean body mass and is 
thermogenic so it increases your energy 

1693
01:19:38,501 --> 01:19:39,334
output and then you can kind of do 
whatever you want with carbs and fats 

1694
01:19:43,451 --> 01:19:44,284
and whatever you prefer and you'll still
lose the same amount of weight and get 

1695
01:19:46,121 --> 01:19:48,310
about all the health benefits.

1696
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:52,270
But it has to be something that you can 
sustain because if you can't sustain it,

1697
01:19:52,271 --> 01:19:53,740
you're going to put all that weight back
on.

1698
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:58,210
That's what the research data shows.
So donald loves sustaining it,

1699
01:19:58,211 --> 01:20:01,930
meaning for life balanced diet that you 
could stick with versus for life,

1700
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:02,793
some sort of a calorie deficit.
That's really only a temporary thing to 

1701
01:20:04,991 --> 01:20:05,890
lose weight.
Right?

1702
01:20:05,891 --> 01:20:08,640
So now obviously you.
You can't eat a deficit forever,

1703
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,533
right?
Because then you would starve yourself 

1704
01:20:10,081 --> 01:20:12,780
to death.
But the body corrects that.

1705
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:14,660
Like you,
as you drop body weight,

1706
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:15,503
your metabolic rate slows down,
you're not in a calorie deficit forever 

1707
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:20,790
when we talk about losing weight and 
then maintaining it,

1708
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,770
right?
So eating in a maintenance,

1709
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:28,130
so eating basically the behaviors you 
use in the style of dieting you use,

1710
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,770
you have to continue that if you want to
maintain it.

1711
01:20:31,771 --> 01:20:34,290
So if you like key to Janet,
like you like key to genic,

1712
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:38,820
you liked you to genic mo and I think 
you're a big fan of meat.

1713
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:41,880
If you can sustain that,
you know,

1714
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,350
like people out there as,
oh my God,

1715
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,273
people will probably tell you you're 
going to get cancer and you're going to 

1716
01:20:45,331 --> 01:20:46,164
do this and you're gonna do that.
Most of those health benefits are just 

1717
01:20:48,841 --> 01:20:53,070
from not having excess body fat,
excess body fat,

1718
01:20:53,071 --> 01:20:57,000
and the metabolic dysregulation of a 
metabolic type syndrome.

1719
01:20:57,570 --> 01:21:00,570
That's what cause 90 percent of these 
problems.

1720
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,190
Okay?
Now,

1721
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:05,910
which is why I get crazy when people say
that fat is healthy.

1722
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:07,890
Well,
well here's the problem.

1723
01:21:07,891 --> 01:21:09,930
It's like we,
we have like reactionary culture.

1724
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:14,520
So we have been through your set point 
is to we have reactionary culture,

1725
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:17,700
so you see this all the time,
so we had,

1726
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:20,130
okay,
you've got to eliminate saturated fat,

1727
01:21:20,131 --> 01:21:20,964
you gotta eliminate dietary fat and just
eat grains and limit your proteins and 

1728
01:21:25,921 --> 01:21:29,250
we got fatter and so the reaction to 
that was don't eat any carbs.

1729
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:31,710
Saturated fat isn't bad for you.
In fact,

1730
01:21:31,711 --> 01:21:34,050
eat as much saturated fat as you can.
It's great.

1731
01:21:34,051 --> 01:21:34,884
Put butter in your coffee like no,
there's good data to show that the 

1732
01:21:39,901 --> 01:21:40,734
research data that I've seen in my 
opinion shows that saturated fat 

1733
01:21:43,831 --> 01:21:46,950
absolutely was demonized.
It's not as bad as we thought,

1734
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:51,150
but it's if you eat too much of it,
it's not great either,

1735
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,030
especially with carbohydrates.
Oh absolutely.

1736
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:55,283
Because now you're increasing your.
Now you're increasing your liver 

1737
01:21:56,881 --> 01:21:59,210
production of saturated fats as well,
right?

1738
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:01,080
When your body gets into a fat burning 
stage,

1739
01:22:01,081 --> 01:22:03,900
and then on top of that,
you pile on carbohydrates,

1740
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,030
then your body wants to store those 
carbohydrates.

1741
01:22:06,031 --> 01:22:06,864
As with the Calorie surplus,
you actually technically you store the 

1742
01:22:10,411 --> 01:22:12,930
fats,
you started because you carbohydrate,

1743
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,640
you burn the carbohydrates stored,
right?

1744
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:16,890
So carbohydrate.
If you say,

1745
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:17,491
well,
why does,

1746
01:22:17,491 --> 01:22:18,324
if you don't store Kobo,
so I talk about this in my book because 

1747
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,950
people will go too far to each direction
to say,

1748
01:22:22,951 --> 01:22:23,820
well,
you said you don't.

1749
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:27,120
You only use you hardly story.
Any carbohydrate is actual fat.

1750
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:30,870
Why don't we eat zero fat and mostly 
carbohydrates?

1751
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:34,260
Well then your body,
your body's not dumb,

1752
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:35,280
your body,
we didn't.

1753
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:36,323
You didn't get here today and get 
through evolution in tens of thousand 

1754
01:22:39,031 --> 01:22:40,610
years of hard,
you know,

1755
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:41,453
living by your body,
being stupid so your body can ramp up 

1756
01:22:44,911 --> 01:22:45,744
Denovo,
lipogenesis so that you can create fat 

1757
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:51,540
from carbohydrate.
If fat gets low in carbohydrate intake,

1758
01:22:51,541 --> 01:22:53,170
gets high enough.
Essential fatty acid.

1759
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:57,360
There was a research study or a med 
analysis done by Kevin Hall,

1760
01:22:57,361 --> 01:22:58,194
who's an Nih researcher,
and they showed that if you equate 

1761
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:03,624
calories,
you get a extra benefit from fat 

1762
01:23:07,631 --> 01:23:09,910
restriction versus carb restriction on 
fat loss.

1763
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:12,970
So you get about 26 grams extra fat loss
per day.

1764
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:17,830
Calories equated a protein acquainted if
you restrict fat versus carp.

1765
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:18,783
Now before everybody goes crazy.
That's probably due to a little bit of 

1766
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:26,110
inefficiencies in ramping up Denovo 
lipogenesis because there's.

1767
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:27,483
It takes energy to move that system,
but 26 grams of fat loss per day to me 

1768
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:34,360
is not a physiological like,
I don't care about that.

1769
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,610
That's nothing compared to,
okay,

1770
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:37,623
if you like low car better,
don't worry about losing extra 26 grams 

1771
01:23:40,931 --> 01:23:43,330
of fat if you like glow car better and 
you can sustain that,

1772
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,193
then do low carb.
One of the things that we seem to be 

1773
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:46,893
getting into here is the difference 
between losing weight and optimal 

1774
01:23:51,011 --> 01:23:51,844
performance and then optimal performance
mentally hormonally versus optimal 

1775
01:23:56,591 --> 01:23:59,080
performance physically in terms of like 
athletic,

1776
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,640
athletic pursuits.
So here's,

1777
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:01,503
here's something else

1778
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,660
type of person,
whether it's,

1779
01:24:03,661 --> 01:24:04,494
you know,
you don't want to put a a teenager 

1780
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:09,210
that's playing football on a ketogenic 
diet necessarily.

1781
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:12,570
Why would that be?
Well,

1782
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,880
maybe if they were overweight,
that could be beneficial,

1783
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:15,773
but I think it would decrease his 
performance unless he goes through the 

1784
01:24:18,481 --> 01:24:21,660
Keto adaptation phase,
but there's a lot of the.

1785
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:22,503
At when you're a teenager,
you're I would say your carbohydrate 

1786
01:24:26,101 --> 01:24:28,100
tolerance is very high.
I want to do.

1787
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:29,380
I want to adjust this.
For My,

1788
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,293
my mind was very high.
I could eat huge plates of pasta that I 

1789
01:24:32,701 --> 01:24:35,220
could not eat now.
I just simply couldn't.

1790
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:37,373
So I think as we age,
I would say our carbohydrate tolerance 

1791
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:45,770
decreases with age because our metabolic
machinery is not as hungry for glucose.

1792
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:51,210
I mean we're set up and hormonally our 
insulin sensitivity is not as high.

1793
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:52,044
Glycolytic pathways are reduced,
things like that that happens as a 

1794
01:24:54,271 --> 01:24:55,104
consequence of age,
so it makes sense that as we transition 

1795
01:24:58,061 --> 01:25:01,260
into age for longevity and for health 
span,

1796
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,040
maybe not lifespan,
but health span,

1797
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,073
a carbohydrate restriction makes sense.
And even in some cases the key to genic 

1798
01:25:07,201 --> 01:25:09,570
diet makes sense.
You know,

1799
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:10,970
but if you look at the,
okay,

1800
01:25:10,971 --> 01:25:14,960
so I have to push backs on that and I'm 
not necessarily disagreeing with you.

1801
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:19,640
I kind of am.
But if you look at longevity data,

1802
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:23,600
the actual longevity Davao people who 
restrict fat versus carbs live longer.

1803
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:25,910
Like that's what a new study that came 
out showed.

1804
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:27,103
But again,

1805
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,253
I'm describing it as also a means of of 
because people put on weight as they 

1806
01:25:32,411 --> 01:25:33,244
age,
we're the low carb and with the 

1807
01:25:34,211 --> 01:25:35,044
ketogenic diet,
that becomes a practical strategy to 

1808
01:25:39,231 --> 01:25:42,920
create a sustainable calorie deficit for
losing weight.

1809
01:25:42,921 --> 01:25:43,754
Sustaining that,
and also if you elevate ketones over 

1810
01:25:45,831 --> 01:25:46,664
time,
a lot of the new research that's coming 

1811
01:25:48,321 --> 01:25:49,220
out,
you know,

1812
01:25:49,221 --> 01:25:52,640
over the last five years,
ketones is not just a superior source of

1813
01:25:52,641 --> 01:25:53,474
energy metabolically,
but it also has epigenetic effects on 

1814
01:25:56,511 --> 01:25:57,344
the body.
It activate gene pathways that can 

1815
01:25:58,761 --> 01:26:02,480
confer resistance against oxidative 
stress,

1816
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:06,110
that longevity pathways,
anti inflammatory pathway in the context

1817
01:26:06,111 --> 01:26:07,370
of a deficit.
No,

1818
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:10,640
not in the context of deficit.
You could feed ketones,

1819
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:14,200
take a ketone supplement,
and it activates a,

1820
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:15,223
just simply elevating Beta 
hydroxybutyrate functions as a histone 

1821
01:26:18,231 --> 01:26:21,200
deacetylase inhibitor and can activate 
a,

1822
01:26:21,201 --> 01:26:22,034
if you will,
a gene programs that can confer 

1823
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:27,470
resistance against many different 
things,

1824
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:28,940
uh,
oxidative stress pathways,

1825
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:29,833
and also activate or suppress and 
inflammatory pathway that's linked with 

1826
01:26:34,131 --> 01:26:37,940
many age related chronic diseases and 
autoimmune pathways.

1827
01:26:37,941 --> 01:26:41,900
It decreases the activation of the NLRP 
three inflammasome.

1828
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,063
So

1829
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:43,993
what about people living longer?
You're talking about that epidemiology 

1830
01:26:46,911 --> 01:26:47,744
study that was like a questionnaire or 
people what they ate over a long period 

1831
01:26:51,351 --> 01:26:52,184
of time.
Highly criticized studies and there's a 

1832
01:26:55,911 --> 01:26:58,790
lot of co founders,
which is why I'm not as hard to say.

1833
01:26:58,791 --> 01:26:59,624
It's hard to say that the study shows 
that if you eat carbs versus fat that 

1834
01:27:03,391 --> 01:27:04,710
you,
you live.

1835
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,553
I didn't say one was causing effect,
sort of cited in a piece of evidence 

1836
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:10,993
because I don't cherry pick because if 
we're going to give the argument I want 

1837
01:27:13,731 --> 01:27:15,920
to give the whole argument.
I was playing devil's advocate.

1838
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:18,410
I don't think that necessarily,
uh,

1839
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:19,423
if you eat a low carb diet,
it's going to cause you to live a 

1840
01:27:20,631 --> 01:27:22,100
shorter life.
I don't believe that,

1841
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:23,443
but I think it's important to put all 
the data out there because what I see a 

1842
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:27,074
lot of is people just cherry picking and
I will pose those with those studies 

1843
01:27:29,961 --> 01:27:30,794
they get.
They become co founders and everybody 

1844
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:33,460
will say,
you know,

1845
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,390
eat carbs.
You live fat.

1846
01:27:35,391 --> 01:27:37,400
Diets are going to kill you.
And then it just gets crazy.

1847
01:27:37,401 --> 01:27:38,050
Here's the wire.

1848
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:39,490
Some of the animal work.
I mean,

1849
01:27:39,491 --> 01:27:40,324
Lena and I both did animal work.
I think some of the animal work is 

1850
01:27:42,401 --> 01:27:43,234
almost more reliable because you have an
inbred strain of animal and you have 

1851
01:27:47,531 --> 01:27:50,050
very tight control if you have 
genetically identical,

1852
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,060
freely living human,
you know,

1853
01:27:52,061 --> 01:27:55,870
he's doing many different things and 
there's genetic variability,

1854
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:56,923
uh,
but with animals that it may not always 

1855
01:27:58,721 --> 01:28:01,060
be predictive.
It's informative,

1856
01:28:01,061 --> 01:28:03,120
but not always predictive.
And I think some of the,

1857
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:04,263
the data,
I read some of the human studies and 

1858
01:28:05,831 --> 01:28:09,820
become a more confused,
but going back to the animal data,

1859
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:14,560
I'm almost more comfortable with some of
these outcomes for animal studies.

1860
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:15,450
So

1861
01:28:15,450 --> 01:28:19,620
one thing I want to bring up that I 
think is really important is we have,

1862
01:28:19,650 --> 01:28:20,483
I think we're all getting to this point 
and people out there think that there's 

1863
01:28:23,611 --> 01:28:26,250
like this perfect diet that's going to 
cure everything.

1864
01:28:26,251 --> 01:28:28,550
And all of our ails.
The fact,

1865
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,690
the uncomfortable truth in the fact of 
the matter is that if one diet is an.

1866
01:28:32,691 --> 01:28:33,524
I don't know this specifically,
but my guess is if one diet is a better 

1867
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,980
for cancer,
it might be worse for heart disease.

1868
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,770
Or if one diet is better for insulin 
resistance,

1869
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:44,820
maybe it's worse for cancer,
it's better for cognitive performance,

1870
01:28:44,821 --> 01:28:46,600
it might be worse,
we don't,

1871
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:50,050
we don't know yet.
So that's kind of where is your space at

1872
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:51,303
now?
And this is why I go back to those big 

1873
01:28:52,331 --> 01:28:55,240
picture things of most of the health 
benefits.

1874
01:28:55,241 --> 01:28:58,060
Just come from having more muscle.

1875
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,610
Lift weights,
lift weights.

1876
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:01,693
If you're,
if you're debating about diets and 

1877
01:29:02,581 --> 01:29:03,414
you're not lifting weights,
you are fucking missing the point 

1878
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:06,983
because that is.
Sorry I curse a so that I do it on 

1879
01:29:10,831 --> 01:29:11,664
twitter.
You've seen me.

1880
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,930
So,
uh,

1881
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:14,550
it's very good at emphasizing your 
point.

1882
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:15,480
Yes.
So,

1883
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:17,460
um,
I'm a fan of it.

1884
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,930
Awesome.
Fucking awesome.

1885
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,320
So,
uh,

1886
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:22,140
somebody criticized me for one day.
I was like,

1887
01:29:22,141 --> 01:29:23,340
you know,
what's great about my job?

1888
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:26,190
I can say fuck as much as I want and 
nobody's going to fire me.

1889
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,570
So that is great.
Um,

1890
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:31,800
but the big picture things,
lift weights,

1891
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:34,980
create more lean body mass,
be active.

1892
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,990
That's a huge thing.
Even if you're overweight,

1893
01:29:36,991 --> 01:29:37,920
if you're active,
you're,

1894
01:29:37,921 --> 01:29:39,990
you're gonna live fine.
But on the whole,

1895
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:40,824
you're going to live longer than the 
person who's inactive and then control 

1896
01:29:44,491 --> 01:29:47,550
your weight,
so if you can even see if you can get to

1897
01:29:47,551 --> 01:29:49,410
a normal weight and maintain it or 
sorry,

1898
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,770
normal body fat and maintain it,
or if you're a high body fat,

1899
01:29:52,771 --> 01:29:55,080
if you can get to a lower body fat and 
maintain it.

1900
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:57,120
Nice.
That's 90,

1901
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:58,373
95 percent of the battle.
All this other stuff is five percent 

1902
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:02,940
that we're worrying about that we're 
going back and forth about.

1903
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:06,540
And that's why I don't want to miss the 
context because when people like,

1904
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:07,374
uh,
I'll pick on him because he was who 

1905
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:10,560
asked for it.
Gary Taubes.

1906
01:30:10,561 --> 01:30:13,050
But I'm happy.
I'm happier we got done for this.

1907
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,960
But I'm going to just interject.
Hey God,

1908
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:16,213
wait,
wait.

1909
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,000
When people like Gary Taubes say things 
like carbs or are causing obesity,

1910
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:23,964
just carbs,
you create this problem where if people 

1911
01:30:28,321 --> 01:30:32,100
don't like eating high fat diet or a low
carb diet and they can't sustain it,

1912
01:30:32,101 --> 01:30:34,650
they just feel like they're a big 
failure and they just quit.

1913
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:35,843
Because what's the point?
If carbs are causing fat and I can't 

1914
01:30:37,321 --> 01:30:38,154
stop eating carbs,
what am I going to have a real hard 

1915
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:42,570
problem with?
I know what you're saying.

1916
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:45,450
Discipline.
It's important or this nonsense,

1917
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:49,140
but I think my point is that if you give
people flexibility,

1918
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,200
it usually improves adherence.
Right?

1919
01:30:52,201 --> 01:30:54,540
And you're talking about from your point
of view,

1920
01:30:54,541 --> 01:30:55,620
coaching people.
Right?

1921
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:56,473
And what I would like to see is I would 
like to see a diet that's protein and 

1922
01:30:58,441 --> 01:31:01,260
calorie controlled study,
protein calorie controlled.

1923
01:31:01,261 --> 01:31:03,030
If anybody knows of one that has done 
this,

1924
01:31:03,031 --> 01:31:03,864
let me know.
Protein and calorie controlled and then 

1925
01:31:05,281 --> 01:31:09,120
let people self select higher carb,
higher fat.

1926
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:10,403
What do you prefer?
Let them self select and see how well 

1927
01:31:12,571 --> 01:31:13,404
they do.
And I bet you would see improvements in 

1928
01:31:15,001 --> 01:31:16,470
adherence in both groups.

1929
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:17,913
Dom,
you were going to.

1930
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:18,953
Well,
I think a diet strategy that controls 

1931
01:31:23,641 --> 01:31:26,910
your appetite and does not have your 
appetite controlling you.

1932
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:28,133
Uh,
which I think is accomplished with a 

1933
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:30,343
ketogenetic diet.
That's also one that's a well 

1934
01:31:32,551 --> 01:31:34,260
formulated.
One that's controls,

1935
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:36,810
you know,
that has fiber and adequate protein.

1936
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:42,230
A is a strategy that allows you to be 
far less fixated on food,

1937
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,640
uh,
because you're not as hungry and you can

1938
01:31:44,641 --> 01:31:46,590
decrease your meal frequency.
So if there's,

1939
01:31:46,591 --> 01:31:49,440
I know there's people out there that are
busy people,

1940
01:31:49,441 --> 01:31:50,790
ceos of companies,
uh,

1941
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:52,650
students or whatever,
uh,

1942
01:31:52,651 --> 01:31:53,484
that simply do not have time to prepare 
and eat a meals too when they get 

1943
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:00,394
hungry.
So by reducing meal frequency you can 

1944
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:04,564
increase your productivity and I think 
you're kind of coaching your body to be 

1945
01:32:07,650 --> 01:32:12,550
a better fat burning.
I think there's definitely benefits.

1946
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:13,473
So when you are on a ketogenic diet,
you are storing more fat but you are 

1947
01:32:16,661 --> 01:32:17,470
burning more fat.

1948
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:18,303
So think about your adipose tissue as 
little bags which have fat coming into 

1949
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:26,470
them and fat leaving them and the fat 
oxidation pathways or elevated.

1950
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:29,680
And when I eat a ton of fat at night 
before I go to bed,

1951
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:30,733
I am like some people carb load.
I'm like fat loading at night and I'm 

1952
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:37,970
pulling off those fat stores during the 
day through my adolescence.

1953
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:40,330
Uh,
I think about it like that.

1954
01:32:40,331 --> 01:32:41,950
So instead of just,
you know,

1955
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:45,730
carbing up at nighttime and I tend to,
I would wake up hungry,

1956
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,593
I would probably dump insulin and then 
wake up with a hypoglycemic cravings in 

1957
01:32:49,901 --> 01:32:53,260
the middle of the night if I did that 
time restricted eating a,

1958
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:54,330
yeah.
Like today,

1959
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,233
like I'm fasting and,
and most days that I want to be as 

1960
01:32:57,101 --> 01:33:00,580
productive as possible.
I will not have my first meal which will

1961
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:03,190
be typically a ketogenic meal around 
4:00

1962
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:03,610
PM.

1963
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:05,860
And what time to eat at night?
Uh,

1964
01:33:05,861 --> 01:33:06,694
I will start,
I'll do a small meal like at work and 

1965
01:33:08,591 --> 01:33:12,520
then I'll eat my big meal at about 7:00,
maybe 7:00

1966
01:33:12,521 --> 01:33:15,010
and then snack throughout the night and 
maybe eat within,

1967
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:17,770
you know,
I started eating at 4:00

1968
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:19,360
PM and I finished eating and about 10:00
PM.

1969
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:21,550
So you basically start eating at the end
of your day.

1970
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:23,020
Yeah.
So,

1971
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:27,760
and that's very liberating for me.
So.

1972
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:29,710
And I didn't even know this was 
possible,

1973
01:33:29,711 --> 01:33:30,544
but that's like back 10 years ago,
I didn't know it was possible to have 

1974
01:33:32,981 --> 01:33:33,814
that amount of control over my appetite 
and actually feel as lucid and as 

1975
01:33:38,021 --> 01:33:41,070
energetic and be able to,
you know,

1976
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:42,073
uh,
get with lane and do deadlifts with him 

1977
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:44,583
and actually maintain my,
my performance and my strength in the 

1978
01:33:46,571 --> 01:33:48,730
gym.
I don't feel like I'm an outlier either.

1979
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:49,633
I think it's possible.
So I think that anecdotes are good 

1980
01:33:53,630 --> 01:33:55,490
because anecdotes calls us to look at 
things.

1981
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:57,600
But I can tell you like,
um,

1982
01:33:57,710 --> 01:33:59,630
so for example,
I usually four times a day,

1983
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:03,740
uh,
and I protein right now I'm in a gaining

1984
01:34:03,741 --> 01:34:05,720
phase,
so I'm trying to purposely gain weight.

1985
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:07,880
Hopefully some lean body mass.
I'm coming back from an injury.

1986
01:34:07,881 --> 01:34:09,620
So trying to regain some weight,
lean body mass.

1987
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:13,220
I'm eating about 400 to 450 grams of 
carbohydrate today.

1988
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,740
Um,
there were times when I'll go seven,

1989
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:16,603
eight hours,
I won't eat and I don't really get 

1990
01:34:17,661 --> 01:34:19,010
hungry.
So,

1991
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:20,900
I mean,
there's 16 hours.

1992
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:22,323
Uh,
I don't.

1993
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:23,990
Uh,
I dunno,

1994
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:26,180
I dunno,
but I don't think I would.

1995
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,073
I go some some nights I'll sleep and 
I'll wake up and I'll go 12 slash 13 

1996
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:31,830
hours,
like I'll go in sometimes and,

1997
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:34,100
and I don't usually get hungry now,
but again,

1998
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:37,580
that's just think that is just a,
well,

1999
01:34:37,581 --> 01:34:38,414
if you look at some of the things that 
all disagree with or are the idea that 

2000
01:34:41,571 --> 01:34:42,404
insulin has these big fluctuations and 
you become hypoglycemic and that causes 

2001
01:34:44,841 --> 01:34:47,810
over feeding.
In some people that's the case,

2002
01:34:47,811 --> 01:34:50,810
but most people,
if they're eating a,

2003
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:54,050
especially with a higher protein diet,
that doesn't usually happen.

2004
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:55,040
I want

2005
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,980
to add that the population,
most people are

2006
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:58,813
not bodybuilders and the population of,
of people that lean mostly communicates 

2007
01:35:03,021 --> 01:35:08,021
with our on the border of being 
metabolically elite and also have a very

2008
01:35:08,451 --> 01:35:09,284
high carb tolerance.
If you're a bodybuilder with a large 

2009
01:35:11,211 --> 01:35:15,950
amount of lean body mass,
you are pretty much metabolically set up

2010
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:16,813
to be a very,
have a high carb tolerance so that the 

2011
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:20,114
general population is not like that.
So let's talk about Clark polaroids 

2012
01:35:22,191 --> 01:35:24,800
because I,
that's one thing that will disagree on.

2013
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:26,390
I don't think that people are more,
uh,

2014
01:35:26,391 --> 01:35:27,224
less carb tolerant.
I think that people have sought slower 

2015
01:35:30,861 --> 01:35:33,620
and faster metabolic rates.
So if you have a faster metabolic rate,

2016
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:34,543
you'll be more tolerant by default 
because you could just tolerate more 

2017
01:35:36,411 --> 01:35:37,300
calories.
I agree with.

2018
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:41,340
But in a bodybuilder that's 220 pounds 
on average,

2019
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:42,740
on average.
Yep.

2020
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:43,783
Now,
if you look at somebody who's on a 

2021
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:46,364
ketogenic diet,
they're actually by definition of carb 

2022
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:49,513
tolerance,
there are carbohydrate intolerant 

2023
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:53,190
because if you challenge them with a 
Bolus of glucose,

2024
01:35:53,191 --> 01:35:54,620
when they click,
they can't clear it.

2025
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,230
So,
but that,

2026
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,280
that doesn't,
that's just because what they're adapted

2027
01:35:58,281 --> 01:35:58,971
to.
Right.

2028
01:35:58,971 --> 01:36:00,590
But there are fat adapted.
Yeah.

2029
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:01,490
Great.
Great.

2030
01:36:01,490 --> 01:36:02,480
So I actually,
uh,

2031
01:36:02,481 --> 01:36:04,520
the first experimental biology we ever 
went to,

2032
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,170
this is why,
you know,

2033
01:36:06,230 --> 01:36:09,580
even scientists get this shit so wrong 
sometimes because again,

2034
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:10,423
they get so in their echo chamber,
they don't bother to look outside of it 

2035
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:17,180
going to the gym when we first met and 
went lane stopped and had a huge meal,

2036
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:18,710
which to me,
I was like,

2037
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:22,520
you feel like doing or we're going to 
stop and eat pizza for I go squat.

2038
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:26,630
It's a real heavy fatty meal.
Visit the bathroom about five times.

2039
01:36:26,631 --> 01:36:28,280
But you know,
I didn't,

2040
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:29,720
I forgot,
I think I did eat,

2041
01:36:29,721 --> 01:36:30,554
but it was very abnormal for me to go 
eat a meal heavy meal on the way that 

2042
01:36:33,771 --> 01:36:34,604
Jim,
holly's like you,

2043
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:35,750
she,
she hates training,

2044
01:36:35,751 --> 01:36:36,170
fed.

2045
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:38,330
She wants to be fast and she feels 
better that way.

2046
01:36:38,331 --> 01:36:40,250
But that's the individual differences,
right?

2047
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,860
That's the individual differences.
Part of it.

2048
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:46,400
Part of it may be you're just adapted to
that as well and what you're used to.

2049
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:47,234
So maybe a psychological thing,
but some people may just do better that 

2050
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,053
we're blood is diverted to your 
digestive system and processes and 

2051
01:36:53,421 --> 01:36:56,010
that's less blood for the muscle.
So you're,

2052
01:36:56,011 --> 01:36:59,200
you're expending energy to digest 
breakdown.

2053
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:02,900
Then similarly is that there has been 
pretty debunked.

2054
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:04,170
Really?
Yeah.

2055
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:08,090
But something happened.
I mean it's just a fundamental.

2056
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:12,450
You've got a logical concept that you 
are diverting blood resource to,

2057
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,313
to a particular job of a scientist is to
question even those theories we hold 

2058
01:37:16,851 --> 01:37:20,010
most to be true.
Neil degrasse Tyson says,

2059
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:20,990
yeah,
but it,

2060
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:21,833
it's.
So I think a small meal actually it can 

2061
01:37:23,061 --> 01:37:23,894
be beneficial,
but it's not like you're using Mongo 

2062
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:28,370
hydrates during the meal.

2063
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:29,203
You're not using the product.
And how has it been debunked that they 

2064
01:37:33,021 --> 01:37:33,854
see that performance isn't worse and 
that you don't like is the performance 

2065
01:37:38,901 --> 01:37:39,734
specifically.
There's not a limitation of blood flow 

2066
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:44,450
because you've eaten something to the 
muscle.

2067
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:46,400
There's not a limitation of blood flow 
to the muscle.

2068
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:49,220
Um,
but again,

2069
01:37:49,221 --> 01:37:52,400
some people just do better if they're 
faster or have small meals.

2070
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,350
Again,
it may be a psychological thing,

2071
01:37:54,351 --> 01:37:55,184
but I like to feel like I've had a lot 
of food and I'm fully fueled for a long 

2072
01:37:58,561 --> 01:37:59,394
training session,
but some people will feel kind of 

2073
01:38:00,691 --> 01:38:01,340
training.
No,

2074
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:04,080
like if you're doing something like 
squats in a very controlled,

2075
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,990
but if you were doing something like it 
might be different.

2076
01:38:06,991 --> 01:38:08,490
Yeah,
if you were doing Jujitsu,

2077
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,230
but I don't know,
you would probably throw up.

2078
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:11,520
Maybe.
I don't know.

2079
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:13,410
I,
I did it very briefly.

2080
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,690
Awesome sport.
Like I did it very briefly,

2081
01:38:15,691 --> 01:38:16,524
informally.
Also really can't have a big meal and 

2082
01:38:18,181 --> 01:38:19,014
then go train and get fucked up.
I'd probably have gone to the bathroom 

2083
01:38:21,421 --> 01:38:23,370
every few minutes.
I can't work on a grant.

2084
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:25,890
I can't.
I'm not supposed to talk about guns,

2085
01:38:25,891 --> 01:38:28,470
but mean if I go to the range and it's 
supposed to have guns.

2086
01:38:28,471 --> 01:38:29,880
My.
Let's talk about guns.

2087
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:31,480
When you talk.
We talked a lot before.

2088
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:37,320
My groups are tighter,
I can better control and if I go in in a

2089
01:38:37,321 --> 01:38:39,610
fed state,
I'm just not as focused as that.

2090
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:40,473
My vision,
my vision is not as acute in the right 

2091
01:38:42,661 --> 01:38:45,480
after a big meal as if I'm fast at 16 
hours,

2092
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:46,343
but this is,
this is the hard thing with anecdote 

2093
01:38:47,670 --> 01:38:49,670
because we can't tease out whether or 
not that's.

2094
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:50,573
That is an actual physiological thing or
whether you just feel better and you 

2095
01:38:53,551 --> 01:38:54,384
think you'll do better so you do better 
because the brain is unbelievably 

2096
01:38:57,181 --> 01:38:57,630
powerful.

2097
01:38:57,630 --> 01:38:58,463
There was a study and um,
I may butcher it because I can't 

2098
01:39:00,751 --> 01:39:01,584
remember it exactly,
but they took people who had legit 

2099
01:39:03,091 --> 01:39:03,924
allergy problems and they gave them a 
sugar pill and they said this will 

2100
01:39:07,651 --> 01:39:10,650
improve your allergies.
It should not have done anything.

2101
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:12,593
Over half the people reported their 
symptoms got better and 30 percent 

2102
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:20,100
actually physiologically got better 
because their brain was telling them get

2103
01:39:20,101 --> 01:39:22,680
better.
Like it's pretty crazy.

2104
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:23,723
So that's part of probably the best diet
for you might be the Diet you can stick 

2105
01:39:27,691 --> 01:39:29,910
to and just feel real positive about.
Right.

2106
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:30,893
Because you feel like this might be 
someone what's going on with a lot of 

2107
01:39:33,481 --> 01:39:34,314
this low carb stuff that people say they
feel so fantastic because there's some 

2108
01:39:37,531 --> 01:39:40,290
sort of a placebo effect that's 
possible.

2109
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,153
I think part of it is too is that's why 
animals studies are given me more 

2110
01:39:44,221 --> 01:39:45,054
confidence when I can look at rats or 
mice on a ketogenic diet and see and 

2111
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:50,340
objectable,
you know,

2112
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:53,250
objective increase or decrease in a 
parameter.

2113
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:55,440
Then I gained confidence.
But here's the thing.

2114
01:39:55,441 --> 01:39:58,020
I'm not saying that that's a bad thing.
If you feel good about it,

2115
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:01,140
that's great,
but just don't try to get on twitter and

2116
01:40:01,141 --> 01:40:01,974
tell everybody all you're going to gain 
fat in a deficit because you're eating 

2117
01:40:03,991 --> 01:40:04,824
carbs right up.
If you go to a witch doctor and you 

2118
01:40:06,601 --> 01:40:08,220
really believe it might actually help 
you,

2119
01:40:08,410 --> 01:40:10,020
yes.
One of the,

2120
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:10,883
one of the number one characteristics of
cancer survivors is that they're 

2121
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:17,160
actually.
They have a belief in God.

2122
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:20,550
They believe that they're going to make 
it through that.

2123
01:40:20,551 --> 01:40:23,020
Now,
some people cause or effect.

2124
01:40:23,021 --> 01:40:25,170
Some people will argue religious people 
will argue,

2125
01:40:25,171 --> 01:40:26,004
well,
they believe in God and so God is 

2126
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:27,654
helping them.
The other argument to that is they 

2127
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:33,440
believe that they are going to make it 
through there and so they have a moral,

2128
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:34,283
a better likelihood of doing it,
so your brain is believe in the 

2129
01:40:37,831 --> 01:40:38,664
ketogenic diet and believe in God and I 
think that's a great thing and that day 

2130
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:47,340
they have remarkable.
I believe that you know,

2131
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:47,710
well,
I,

2132
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:49,410
I,
I'm a person of faith,

2133
01:40:49,411 --> 01:40:54,411
but I also believe that if you have 
faith in the methodology to the patients

2134
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:55,443
that have communicated with me that 
actually believed that this approach is 

2135
01:40:58,211 --> 01:40:59,044
gonna work and then they reached that 
actual therapeutic state of ketogenetic 

2136
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:06,820
diet have results that kind of defy what
you would expect scientifically.

2137
01:41:06,821 --> 01:41:11,821
So I believe it's working 
physiologically and also psychologically

2138
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:14,740
there is immuno psycho therapy,
right?

2139
01:41:14,741 --> 01:41:15,574
Or immunology.
So our brain can actually control many 

2140
01:41:20,081 --> 01:41:20,914
different physiological processes 
including our immune system and that 

2141
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:25,563
that is something that's under 
appreciated and under studied and that 

2142
01:41:27,731 --> 01:41:32,320
really needs to be studied in terms of 
eating a large meal before training.

2143
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:36,610
Surely your body has to use up some of 
the resources to digest.

2144
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:38,950
You don't think that it's blood flow to 
the muscle.

2145
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:40,470
Well,
it's been debunked.

2146
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:45,420
They show that the blood flow to the 
muscle is not limiting.

2147
01:41:45,450 --> 01:41:47,880
If you've had a meal before you train.
Okay.

2148
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:52,560
Now the thing is,
but some people don't like that.

2149
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:54,390
It's a very individual thing.
It probably,

2150
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:56,710
it may be a psychological thing with me.
I'm not,

2151
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:57,643
I'm not.
I understand that I'm an idiot like 

2152
01:41:59,041 --> 01:42:00,630
everybody else out there,
right?

2153
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:01,673
So I'm subject to bias and a 
psychological influence like anybody 

2154
01:42:06,661 --> 01:42:09,120
else,
but I just used that to my advantage.

2155
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:11,310
If I feel good about it,
why would I not do it?

2156
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:13,950
Now,
if you train in the morning,

2157
01:42:13,951 --> 01:42:14,784
do you do that?
Like heading to the gym first thing in 

2158
01:42:16,141 --> 01:42:16,974
the morning?
Holly tries to stop me because then I 

2159
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:20,400
usually end up going to the bathroom for
like five times,

2160
01:42:20,401 --> 01:42:21,234
but um,
I'll eat a little bit less in the 

2161
01:42:23,311 --> 01:42:24,144
morning if I'm,
if I'm going to go straight in and 

2162
01:42:25,411 --> 01:42:26,244
train.

2163
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:27,780
Uh,
but one of the things that,

2164
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:31,950
that going back that so many scientists 
miss is that context,

2165
01:42:31,951 --> 01:42:34,260
like most people miss context,
but scientists,

2166
01:42:34,261 --> 01:42:35,094
even ms dot context.
So the first experimental biology study 

2167
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:40,380
or first experimental biology symposium 
we ever went to,

2168
01:42:40,710 --> 01:42:45,710
there was a poster where they fed people
a ketogenic diet or they fed them a high

2169
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:47,034
carb diet and then at the end of six 
weeks they challenged them with 100 

2170
01:42:49,651 --> 01:42:53,850
grams of glucose and looked how long it 
took for them to clear that glucose.

2171
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:55,223
The ketogenic diet people would have 
been worse than type two diabetics at 

2172
01:42:59,461 --> 01:43:01,030
clearing glucose.
Okay?

2173
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,780
Whereas people eating a high carb diet 
cleared it just fine.

2174
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:04,823
Right now if you,
if you just looked at these numbers as 

2175
01:43:06,571 --> 01:43:07,940
Dr.
Oh my God,

2176
01:43:08,010 --> 01:43:09,480
you're diabetic.
No,

2177
01:43:09,481 --> 01:43:10,314
that's what they were adapted to and I 
challenged the person with the poster I 

2178
01:43:12,991 --> 01:43:13,740
said,
and he,

2179
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:16,590
for all you kidogenic diet people who 
hate me on twitter,

2180
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:18,460
I defend the Akita,
didn't it?

2181
01:43:18,510 --> 01:43:21,180
When it is time to be defended,
I said to the girl,

2182
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:25,860
if you had fed a high fat meal to these 
people,

2183
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:28,230
you would have seen the same thing in 
reverse.

2184
01:43:28,890 --> 01:43:31,590
If you would have fed a high fat meals,
people who are out of the ketogenic diet

2185
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:32,603
and then a high carb diet,
you would have seen really elevated 

2186
01:43:35,730 --> 01:43:38,660
triglycerides,
ldl cholesterol,

2187
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:40,060
ldl cholesterol,
Calabar,

2188
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:43,590
Crohn's,
and people who were carpet acted because

2189
01:43:43,591 --> 01:43:46,170
it wasn't being cleared because that's 
not what you're adapted to.

2190
01:43:46,230 --> 01:43:48,590
But people miss that whole context is a

2191
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:51,480
good analogy in his book.
That book where if you have a,

2192
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:53,000
a,
a factory,

2193
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:57,260
military factory that's making planes 
and then it has to switch over to making

2194
01:43:57,290 --> 01:43:59,810
a ship's right,
so you,

2195
01:43:59,811 --> 01:44:03,830
it takes a lot of time to change sort of
all the processes that take place.

2196
01:44:04,130 --> 01:44:06,950
Uh,
and the same thing as sort of happening.

2197
01:44:06,951 --> 01:44:08,840
I mean,
you're giving your body a different fuel

2198
01:44:08,841 --> 01:44:09,674
source.
So it has to ramp up the enzymatic 

2199
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:14,330
machinery,
the pathways,

2200
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:18,410
the regulatory pathways and the 
transporters even to basically use those

2201
01:44:18,411 --> 01:44:19,191
fuels.
Yeah.

2202
01:44:19,191 --> 01:44:20,024
And the misunderstanding of that,
or at least an ignorance as one of the 

2203
01:44:22,101 --> 01:44:25,310
more frustrating things online when I 
hear like nonsense people,

2204
01:44:25,530 --> 01:44:30,530
these Internet air quote experts talking
about the negative aspects of the key to

2205
01:44:31,221 --> 01:44:33,200
genic dye that they tried it and they 
felt weak.

2206
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:34,820
Like,
what do you mean you tried it,

2207
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:35,990
you tried it for a day.

2208
01:44:36,010 --> 01:44:38,150
Do you try it for three days?
You got it for a month.

2209
01:44:38,151 --> 01:44:39,080
Like,
get the fuck Outta here.

2210
01:44:39,081 --> 01:44:40,640
You can.
Yeah.

2211
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:42,280
It's important.
Like when,

2212
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:43,133
when you review a study and um,
I think you have a study in your book 

2213
01:44:47,001 --> 01:44:47,834
actually that shows in the gym.
You basically say the key to genic diet 

2214
01:44:51,231 --> 01:44:53,600
can hurt your performance in the gym.
So,

2215
01:44:53,601 --> 01:44:54,434
and you reference a race walking study 
where I think they did the key to genic 

2216
01:44:57,531 --> 01:45:00,260
diet for like three weeks or something 
like that.

2217
01:45:00,261 --> 01:45:01,130
So,
uh,

2218
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:02,053
I think we came back around and said 
that it's probably fine once you're 

2219
01:45:04,461 --> 01:45:06,660
adapted to it,
once you're adapted to it,

2220
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,450
what's the time period we're talking 
about?

2221
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:09,823
For me,
I did not feel myself after it took me 

2222
01:45:12,291 --> 01:45:13,124
about three to four months.
But then you've got to realize that 

2223
01:45:15,201 --> 01:45:17,600
there's a learning curve to doing the 
Ketogenic Diet.

2224
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,430
Right.
So if I go back to my notes,

2225
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:20,533
uh,
I mean my performance in the gym and 

2226
01:45:22,371 --> 01:45:24,830
just general wellbeing took about three 
to four months.

2227
01:45:24,910 --> 01:45:28,070
Do you use an app to a child or 
anything?

2228
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:29,413
I did a my fitness pal and stuff,
but I just know I'm a creature of habit 

2229
01:45:33,531 --> 01:45:37,220
so we basically just buy the same food 
all the time and I can,

2230
01:45:37,221 --> 01:45:38,054
I measure things on scales and stuff 
just as a scientist so I can look at 

2231
01:45:41,330 --> 01:45:45,710
some powder on a scale and do 250 
milligrams or minus,

2232
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:46,573
you know,
10,

2233
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:47,790
10 milligram.
So I,

2234
01:45:47,791 --> 01:45:51,530
I've measured things out to where I can 
look at a plate and basically give you.

2235
01:45:51,531 --> 01:45:52,364
The macro is pretty tight and that's,
I don't know if you do that or have you 

2236
01:45:55,131 --> 01:45:56,900
ever done Quito for long periods of 
time?

2237
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,400
I've done it before.
Yeah.

2238
01:45:58,401 --> 01:46:00,680
And he hasn't been Keto adapted though.

2239
01:46:00,770 --> 01:46:02,980
I would argue that the ketones in my 
life,

2240
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:07,070
but I just wanted to do it for about 
eight weeks.

2241
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,020
So you could argue that I didn't do it 
long enough,

2242
01:46:09,021 --> 01:46:11,660
but my thing is like,
all my blood markers are healthy.

2243
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:13,280
Um,
I didn't see.

2244
01:46:13,430 --> 01:46:14,263
So I did Quito at maintenance and I 
didn't see really much improvement in 

2245
01:46:16,701 --> 01:46:18,680
anything.
Everything kind of stayed the same.

2246
01:46:18,681 --> 01:46:19,240
Now.
What,

2247
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:21,410
what different energy when,
when was this,

2248
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:22,363
what year was this?
Would've been probably after my 

2249
01:46:26,871 --> 01:46:29,060
bodybuilding show before I got back into
powerlifting.

2250
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:32,690
So it would have been some in like 2012.
Did you like post about it?

2251
01:46:32,691 --> 01:46:34,940
And so I want to go back because I 
didn't,

2252
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:35,833
I didn't want to really like get the 
wrath of anybody on me at the time 

2253
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,960
trying it.
Now I'm old and can take a rest.

2254
01:46:41,961 --> 01:46:44,280
I just don't care that much anymore.
But um,

2255
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:45,253
I didn't live performance.
Didn't go down that in the first few 

2256
01:46:47,751 --> 01:46:49,800
weeks it did.
But then it was fine.

2257
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:53,130
I just like the flexibility of having 
some carbs.

2258
01:46:53,710 --> 01:46:54,543
Yeah.
I liked having that flexibility because 

2259
01:46:55,591 --> 01:46:57,140
if you it popcorn,
I remember.

2260
01:46:57,150 --> 01:46:57,983
Yes I do.
If you know popcorn is great though 

2261
01:46:59,791 --> 01:47:01,770
because they see as higher protein and 
higher fiber.

2262
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:04,760
But you know,
if,

2263
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:08,130
if I was going to commit to it as a 
lifestyle,

2264
01:47:08,340 --> 01:47:10,680
then that will be fine,
but unless you're willing to,

2265
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:11,753
again,
if that's not something you're willing 

2266
01:47:12,601 --> 01:47:16,620
to stick to for life,
you have to rethink if you're wanting to

2267
01:47:16,621 --> 01:47:20,430
do it or not benefiting going on and off
ketogenic diets.

2268
01:47:20,431 --> 01:47:21,264
Correct.

2269
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:25,240
I,
so if you do a key to genic diet and you

2270
01:47:25,241 --> 01:47:26,074
want to stay in a state of Ketosis,
the days that I do intermittent fasting 

2271
01:47:28,991 --> 01:47:31,480
now,
which I didn't do like five years ago,

2272
01:47:31,630 --> 01:47:35,560
I don't necessarily do the key.
I do a high higher protein,

2273
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:36,423
low carb,
but my macros or not key to genic 

2274
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:41,800
typically not all the time.
Sometimes they are,

2275
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:43,623
but there are different.
Like you could do intermittent fasting 

2276
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:48,760
with a car based diet and still get 
ketones.

2277
01:47:48,810 --> 01:47:50,590
You know,
by the end of your fast.

2278
01:47:50,591 --> 01:47:51,424
You could do low carb ketogenic.
I actually think it's a little bit 

2279
01:47:54,101 --> 01:47:56,800
better to be metabolically flexible.
So I'll throw in.

2280
01:47:56,801 --> 01:47:57,634
I tend to eat a lot of vegetables and 
then throw in some fruits to have a few 

2281
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,480
days a week where a,
it may kick me out of Ketosis,

2282
01:48:04,481 --> 01:48:07,660
but during the middle of the day when I 
need to be at my best,

2283
01:48:07,661 --> 01:48:08,494
I pretty much always I'm running low to 
moderate ketones during the day and I 

2284
01:48:11,921 --> 01:48:14,260
can do that with different strategies 
now you know,

2285
01:48:14,261 --> 01:48:16,230
with my body,
because as much as I kick you out ptosis

2286
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:17,011
though,
I kind of.

2287
01:48:17,011 --> 01:48:22,011
That's at nighttime,
a lady and a half of a dark chocolate.

2288
01:48:23,591 --> 01:48:26,920
One or two things of dark chocolate and 
a which is maybe 15,

2289
01:48:26,921 --> 01:48:27,754
20 grams of carbs and maybe a half cup 
of blueberries and then a big salad and 

2290
01:48:33,161 --> 01:48:34,360
some vegetables.
Typically

2291
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:36,810
green vegetables.
When you say kicked you out of Ketosis,

2292
01:48:36,870 --> 01:48:40,170
so if you measure your blood,
your ketones dropped below what level?

2293
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:44,790
A point five and I typically don't even 
measure at night,

2294
01:48:44,791 --> 01:48:45,624
but I wake up in the morning and I might
be about point five and then that goes 

2295
01:48:48,631 --> 01:48:50,940
up throughout the day.
So the middle part of the day,

2296
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:53,550
I'm typically running one between one to
two,

2297
01:48:53,551 --> 01:48:54,384
sometimes three milli moles.
The urine strips are only effective in 

2298
01:48:59,131 --> 01:49:01,080
the early stages of Ketosis.
Is that correct?

2299
01:49:01,110 --> 01:49:06,090
Yak because in the beginning you spill 
out a lot of ketones in your urine,

2300
01:49:06,091 --> 01:49:09,840
but as you increase ketone transport and
utilization over time,

2301
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:12,540
less of them end up in your urine.
How much time does that,

2302
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:14,760
uh,
depends on the person.

2303
01:49:14,761 --> 01:49:15,594
But after about two or three weeks,
you may see less of a color change on 

2304
01:49:18,721 --> 01:49:20,880
the urine strips,
even if you didn't change your diet.

2305
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,480
Is there another effective method other 
than the pricking the finger?

2306
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:25,280
Yeah.
Well,

2307
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:26,900
uh,
I think the blood,

2308
01:49:26,901 --> 01:49:27,900
uh,
you know,

2309
01:49:27,901 --> 01:49:31,060
Abbott Labs makes the uh,
precision Xtra.

2310
01:49:31,130 --> 01:49:33,300
There's the Quito Mojo,
which I also use.

2311
01:49:33,301 --> 01:49:34,134
We use in the lab with a Quito Mojo is a
blood measurement and glucose 

2312
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:38,904
measurement device.
That's essentially a because Abbott 

2313
01:49:41,941 --> 01:49:43,020
cornered the market,
they,

2314
01:49:43,021 --> 01:49:43,854
uh,
they basically allow you to check your 

2315
01:49:45,601 --> 01:49:49,180
ketones for a dollar a strip instead of,
you know,

2316
01:49:49,181 --> 01:49:52,030
three or $4 or $5,
but it's still pricking your finger,

2317
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:55,180
pricking your finger.
I don't use the dove,

2318
01:49:55,190 --> 01:49:57,400
I actually use a syringe and just take a
running,

2319
01:49:57,401 --> 01:49:59,890
start in,
jab my finger now because it doesn't get

2320
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:02,460
calluses like you do on your fingers.
So knowing a,

2321
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:03,910
yeah,
I'm Kinda used to it,

2322
01:50:03,911 --> 01:50:05,260
but uh,
the,

2323
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:10,160
the urine strip is actually pretty good 
relative marker and the uh,

2324
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:11,133
Siemens a multistage sg,
we'll measure ketones and then nine 

2325
01:50:15,971 --> 01:50:19,380
other things like that measure kidney 
function and,

2326
01:50:19,381 --> 01:50:21,160
and you know,
your blood glucose and things like that.

2327
01:50:21,161 --> 01:50:21,994
So I recommend that it's twenty five 
cents a strip and then there's the 

2328
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:25,870
breath,
a key tonics meter.

2329
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:29,420
You blow into it and it measures breath 
acetone and uh,

2330
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:32,800
the level is also another breath acetone
measurement system.

2331
01:50:32,801 --> 01:50:34,150
Ask about that.
So yeah,

2332
01:50:34,151 --> 01:50:36,040
and you know,
breath,

2333
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:38,830
acetone highly correlates the fat 
oxidation.

2334
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:41,110
So if your breath,
acetone is high,

2335
01:50:41,111 --> 01:50:44,020
you are burning a lot of fat.
So I sit there an issue with people that

2336
01:50:44,021 --> 01:50:47,560
are key in the state of Ketosis and they
get pulled over for drunk driving.

2337
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:49,653
A couple of lawyers contacted me.
There's some cases going on right now 

2338
01:50:51,641 --> 01:50:56,050
and they wanted me to weigh in on that 
breathalyzers because of the,

2339
01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:59,160
what'd you say?
Acetone breath is.

2340
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,770
It uses the same technology,
a breath acetone,

2341
01:51:02,771 --> 01:51:03,604
and if you,
I know that if you drink alcohol and do 

2342
01:51:07,001 --> 01:51:10,720
a breath ketone meter,
you can kind of pin it depending on what

2343
01:51:10,721 --> 01:51:14,980
meter you're using.
If you're using a breath for breath,

2344
01:51:14,981 --> 01:51:16,040
ketone meter,
if you're using,

2345
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:18,440
if you have a breath,
uh,

2346
01:51:18,730 --> 01:51:22,000
alcohol measurement and you're in a 
state of Ketosis,

2347
01:51:22,001 --> 01:51:26,110
I have not seen that.
Depending on the device that you'll have

2348
01:51:26,111 --> 01:51:28,150
a false positive.
If that's your question,

2349
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:30,040
uh,
some devices can,

2350
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:31,300
it depends on the device.

2351
01:51:31,330 --> 01:51:33,850
So one thing I'll bring up because you 
said,

2352
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:34,773
well,
you work with these kinds of 

2353
01:51:35,561 --> 01:51:40,240
metabolically elite people.
So one of the problems I say what you're

2354
01:51:40,241 --> 01:51:41,074
doing,
where you kind of take yourself up to 

2355
01:51:42,221 --> 01:51:45,250
the point where you're sort of getting 
out of ketosis and then going back in,

2356
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:46,473
that's probably fine,
but most people aren't going to do it 

2357
01:51:48,671 --> 01:51:49,870
that way.
They're going to be like,

2358
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:51,490
oh,
I had a cheesecake,

2359
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:53,350
or oh,
I couldn't take it anymore.

2360
01:51:53,351 --> 01:51:54,370
And I had pizza,
whatever,

2361
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:57,040
that's really bad.
So you see progress,

2362
01:51:57,050 --> 01:51:57,883
really,
people who intermittent fast decrease 

2363
01:51:59,571 --> 01:52:02,780
that window time and overconsume on.
Yeah.

2364
01:52:02,781 --> 01:52:04,160
So that,
that's a big problem.

2365
01:52:04,190 --> 01:52:04,940
So

2366
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:07,490
actually I wanted to bring up 
intermittent fasting too because I think

2367
01:52:07,670 --> 01:52:09,170
again,
like if you.

2368
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:12,910
So the studies on intermittent fasting 
show that um,

2369
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:15,230
you lose the same amount of calories are
the same,

2370
01:52:15,290 --> 01:52:16,970
you lose same amount of weight,
same by the fat,

2371
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:18,673
maybe might be at risk for a little bit 
more lean body mass loss just because 

2372
01:52:21,591 --> 01:52:23,840
you're attributing protein synthesis 
left less often.

2373
01:52:24,650 --> 01:52:25,483
But uh,
you do have a little bit lower insulin 

2374
01:52:27,891 --> 01:52:28,724
levels it seems like now whether or not 
that's again beneficial based on the 

2375
01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:34,790
research that we talked about,
unlikely insulin sensitivity,

2376
01:52:35,570 --> 01:52:37,760
insulin sensitivity was a little bit 
better again.

2377
01:52:37,761 --> 01:52:38,594
So there are some techniques you can do,
but people bring up things like a 

2378
01:52:41,340 --> 01:52:45,500
typology and inflammation.
And again,

2379
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:49,190
I kind of get um,
the soil,

2380
01:52:49,191 --> 01:52:51,050
if you,
if you just calorically restrict,

2381
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:54,290
you increase autophagy and you increase,
you decrease inflammation.

2382
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:55,110
Yeah,

2383
01:52:55,110 --> 01:52:55,943
you don't get an autophagy is dependent 
upon the decrease in certain amino 

2384
01:53:00,931 --> 01:53:01,764
acids.
Glucose and insulin and you achieve 

2385
01:53:04,830 --> 01:53:05,663
those biomarkers states at a more 
significant level doing intermittent 

2386
01:53:10,501 --> 01:53:12,990
fasting and then you would and they are 
the autophagy regulate.

2387
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:13,853
Can you send me the,
the the reason I am amp amp kinase 

2388
01:53:18,030 --> 01:53:18,863
leucine,
so if you're eating various meals 

2389
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:22,553
throughout the day three times a day,
like you know your blood leucine levels 

2390
01:53:25,891 --> 01:53:26,710
will be

2391
01:53:26,710 --> 01:53:28,810
you gotta keep it in context of 24 
hours.

2392
01:53:28,930 --> 01:53:29,763
So people,
people do this with fat storage and 

2393
01:53:32,921 --> 01:53:33,940
oxidation as well.
They say,

2394
01:53:33,941 --> 01:53:35,170
well,
if you're,

2395
01:53:35,171 --> 01:53:37,960
if you're fasting all this time,
you're burning so much body fat.

2396
01:53:38,170 --> 01:53:39,003
Well yeah,
but then by definition if you're eating 

2397
01:53:40,541 --> 01:53:43,120
less at these times,
you have to eat more at this time.

2398
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:44,013
If you're keeping calories the same and 
so during that time post-meal you're 

2399
01:53:47,381 --> 01:53:51,100
going to store a lot more fat.
You're going to have much higher insulin

2400
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:51,850
now,
maybe not.

2401
01:53:51,850 --> 01:53:52,750
Maybe lower overall

2402
01:53:53,370 --> 01:53:54,203
metabolism.
You're overshooting and those calories 

2403
01:53:56,911 --> 01:53:57,700
have to go.

2404
01:53:57,700 --> 01:54:02,360
So point being over 24 hours.
You don't see differences in fat loss or

2405
01:54:02,361 --> 01:54:04,580
fat gain.
Intermittent fasting versus non.

2406
01:54:05,150 --> 01:54:05,983
I would be interested in the 
inflammation stuff and the autophagy 

2407
01:54:07,551 --> 01:54:08,384
stuff because again,
caloric restriction in of itself 

2408
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:13,130
increases or decreases inflammation 
increases a tough to.

2409
01:54:13,131 --> 01:54:13,964
Interestingly enough,
one of the sugar studies they did with 

2410
01:54:15,511 --> 01:54:18,020
with higher sugar,
with still calorically restricted,

2411
01:54:18,350 --> 01:54:19,183
they showed decreases in inflammation.
So inflammation is largely an issue of 

2412
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:25,483
caloric restriction or excess.
As you guys think that that's what's 

2413
01:54:28,701 --> 01:54:30,950
going on with this carnivore diet.
Yeah,

2414
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:32,750
the people,
it's hard now.

2415
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:35,120
I think it's a calorie restriction.
In fact,

2416
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:40,370
it's hard to look at.
If I give you a plate of French fries,

2417
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:44,660
like 200 grams of French fries,
you can get a lot of calories from that.

2418
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:48,110
If I gave you 200 grams of meat,
even a real fatty meat,

2419
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,393
it's not nearly the same like you,
you're going to be much more satiated 

2420
01:54:52,311 --> 01:54:53,144
from the protein.

2421
01:54:53,570 --> 01:54:56,280
Like you can only eat so much meat,
you know.

2422
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:57,740
And uh,
again,

2423
01:54:57,741 --> 01:54:58,574
like if you,
I don't want to go too far down the 

2424
01:55:00,021 --> 01:55:05,021
carnivore diet whole,
but the stuff I see with people yet,

2425
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:08,720
do I think you can eat meat and improve 
your blood markers?

2426
01:55:08,990 --> 01:55:10,820
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

2427
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:12,780
Of course you could eat pop tarts and 
now,

2428
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,330
but,
but the point is,

2429
01:55:14,331 --> 01:55:18,020
is like when we get into this kind of it
have only eat meat.

2430
01:55:18,290 --> 01:55:20,320
You don't need vegetables,
you know,

2431
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:22,490
this,
I mean again,

2432
01:55:22,491 --> 01:55:23,324
it's epidemiology,
but there's some really tight men 

2433
01:55:25,371 --> 01:55:30,350
analyses that have been done looking at 
colorectal cancer and low fiber intake.

2434
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:31,513
And I would not be comfortable 
recommending people not eat enough 

2435
01:55:34,971 --> 01:55:35,960
vegetables and fiber.

2436
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:36,933
I feel uncomfortable eating a steak or a
burger without something like Broccoli 

2437
01:55:42,711 --> 01:55:44,550
or a salad.
I think you negate

2438
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:49,380
many of the potentially carcinogenic 
compounds that are in red meat.

2439
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:51,030
Uh,
and that's a whole nother debate.

2440
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:53,220
But I think eventually,
yeah,

2441
01:55:53,221 --> 01:55:54,860
he admired and,
and uh,

2442
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:55,733
polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
Chris Kresser actually brought that up 

2443
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:01,350
yesterday talking about meat consumption
with vegetables,

2444
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:04,080
like,
with brought cruciferous vegetables,

2445
01:56:04,081 --> 01:56:04,914
Broccolis in Salads.
Like I don't personally would not eat 

2446
01:56:07,441 --> 01:56:08,640
red meat.
So full disclosure,

2447
01:56:08,641 --> 01:56:09,474
I mean I was,
cause I get accused on twitter of being 

2448
01:56:11,311 --> 01:56:12,144
a car guy and I'm not.
I was live research was funded by the 

2449
01:56:15,781 --> 01:56:18,580
egg board,
the beef beef,

2450
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:22,260
a national beef something or another.
Sorry guys.

2451
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:25,380
And then the national dairy council,
so you know,

2452
01:56:25,470 --> 01:56:26,303
full disclosure,
by the way all you guys out there who 

2453
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:29,850
again,
you're just taking my word for it,

2454
01:56:29,851 --> 01:56:30,684
but who think that like industry is this
evil thing that comes in and controls 

2455
01:56:34,921 --> 01:56:35,754
everything.
I met one person in my entire phd from 

2456
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:44,010
the funding sources and I met them for 
literally 30 seconds.

2457
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:44,933
They were at a uh,
it was an experimental biology and they 

2458
01:56:46,651 --> 01:56:47,910
said hi,
thanks for.

2459
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:49,830
Thank you for the grant.
Oh Great.

2460
01:56:49,831 --> 01:56:50,611
Great.
Great job.

2461
01:56:50,611 --> 01:56:51,690
Thank you.
That was it.

2462
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:55,290
Now I'm not saying that there isn't 
nefarious things that can happen,

2463
01:56:55,291 --> 01:56:58,500
but like when I heard when I like the 
show would Nina,

2464
01:56:58,950 --> 01:57:02,130
everything was about who funded it and 
this and that and,

2465
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:05,310
but that's why they have to disclose 
those things on papers.

2466
01:57:05,311 --> 01:57:06,144
And also this is why scientists,
science is self regulating because 

2467
01:57:09,211 --> 01:57:10,044
somebody is going to repeat your study 
and if they don't find the same thing 

2468
01:57:12,571 --> 01:57:13,404
you found you're gonna be in trouble.
So I get criticized for conflict of 

2469
01:57:16,891 --> 01:57:19,080
interest.
I've seen it on social media and things.

2470
01:57:19,330 --> 01:57:20,163
So I should probably say I am not a 
medical doctor or even a registered 

2471
01:57:23,551 --> 01:57:24,384
Dietitian and a phd scientists,
so don't take my word is medical or 

2472
01:57:28,051 --> 01:57:29,040
nutrition advice.

2473
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:31,110
Uh,
we do.

2474
01:57:31,111 --> 01:57:34,980
Our research is funded not only by the 
Department of Defense and Office of navy

2475
01:57:34,981 --> 01:57:35,814
research,
but also by companies that actually 

2476
01:57:37,891 --> 01:57:41,580
develop ketone food products and also 
exogenous ketone supplements.

2477
01:57:41,850 --> 01:57:46,560
And our university owns the rights to 
those patents.

2478
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:48,940
I don't have any products myself or 
come.

2479
01:57:48,990 --> 01:57:49,823
We have a company,
ketone technologies and Quito nutrition 

2480
01:57:51,511 --> 01:57:56,310
has the information website,
but at this time we have no products but

2481
01:57:56,311 --> 01:57:57,144
the university licenses our intellectual
property and products are made out of 

2482
01:58:01,051 --> 01:58:03,360
that.
And I get patent royalties and I put the

2483
01:58:03,361 --> 01:58:08,040
patent royalties back into our research.
So buying various exogenous ketones,

2484
01:58:08,330 --> 01:58:10,530
uh,
products that are on the market can come

2485
01:58:10,531 --> 01:58:15,300
back and help support the science and 
the application of this for him.

2486
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:16,500
I don't,
I,

2487
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:18,930
you know,
I tend not to state that,

2488
01:58:18,931 --> 01:58:21,120
but I get called out for not stating 
that.

2489
01:58:21,121 --> 01:58:21,954
So I think it's important to vouch for 
him because he's actually writing a 

2490
01:58:24,991 --> 01:58:26,070
chapter in my new book.

2491
01:58:26,490 --> 01:58:29,100
So we're going to have a chapter about 
the ketogenic diet if you're going to do

2492
01:58:29,101 --> 01:58:30,270
it,
this is how to do it right.

2493
01:58:30,450 --> 01:58:32,040
So the new book,
fat loss forever,

2494
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:33,540
shameless plug,
'em,

2495
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:34,703
and he said,
I just want all the money that I make 

2496
01:58:38,761 --> 01:58:42,850
from the book to go back into the lab.
So Nice.

2497
01:58:43,210 --> 01:58:47,620
Like that's Walter Longo has a similar 
with prolon with his line too.

2498
01:58:47,621 --> 01:58:49,300
I know his profits.
He,

2499
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:51,070
you know,
the profits that he takes,

2500
01:58:51,071 --> 01:58:51,904
he puts back into research is unbiased.
Anybody that says there are is full of 

2501
01:58:54,551 --> 01:58:56,080
crap.
We all have our biases.

2502
01:58:56,110 --> 01:58:57,400
We all have things that we think work 
better.

2503
01:58:57,401 --> 01:58:58,090
Another.
Sure.

2504
01:58:58,090 --> 01:59:00,120
But I think the fundamental,
if you,

2505
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:00,993
if you meet a scientist,
and hopefully I equip myself well in 

2506
01:59:03,761 --> 01:59:06,730
this and I think dom does as well,
is that one,

2507
01:59:06,731 --> 01:59:07,564
you have an open mind but not so open 
that your brain falls out and to you 

2508
01:59:11,201 --> 01:59:13,750
care more about getting the right answer
than being right.

2509
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:17,770
When I went to do my phd,
I was eating eight meals a day.

2510
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:18,963
I was eating 300 grams of protein a day.
I was looking for more reasons to eat 

2511
01:59:22,031 --> 01:59:25,270
more protein and eat it more frequently 
when I left my phd,

2512
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:30,470
four meals a day and a little bit less 
protein and less frequently.

2513
01:59:31,210 --> 01:59:36,210
And your fractory to the phenomenon.
We're always eating 500 grams of protein

2514
01:59:37,181 --> 01:59:39,100
a day.
I was eating like two or three,

2515
01:59:39,101 --> 01:59:43,640
two pound London broils and washing it 
down with a product metrics with hmb and

2516
01:59:43,641 --> 01:59:44,474
it like in between meals back in the mid
[inaudible] 90 [inaudible] and that was 

2517
01:59:48,851 --> 01:59:49,720
the coolest thing.
It.

2518
01:59:49,730 --> 01:59:53,200
Well actually that was the coolest thing
about my research was it changed the way

2519
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:55,760
I actually changed the way I responded,
but I was,

2520
01:59:55,810 --> 01:59:57,490
I.
That was my bias coming in,

2521
01:59:57,491 --> 01:59:59,320
but I said,
I looked at the research data.

2522
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:01,060
I'm like,
either I believe this or I don't,

2523
02:00:01,070 --> 02:00:04,240
and if I believe this I can't justify x,
Y,

2524
02:00:04,241 --> 02:00:05,330
Z.
can I get.

2525
02:00:05,350 --> 02:00:06,183
Can I go back to the epidemiology 
studies in regards to colon and rectal 

2526
02:00:09,701 --> 02:00:12,340
cancer?
There really haven't been any studies on

2527
02:00:12,341 --> 02:00:14,680
people that just eat meat though,
right?

2528
02:00:14,930 --> 02:00:15,763
You're talking about people who eat meat
on a regular basis and that usually is 

2529
02:00:18,831 --> 02:00:19,664
the standard American diet,
a lot of other bullshit and their sugar 

2530
02:00:22,101 --> 02:00:23,870
bonds and there's tons of the co 
founders.

2531
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:25,293
Absolutely right.
I would be fascinated to see some sort 

2532
02:00:29,351 --> 02:00:33,130
of long term studies on someone who's on
a very strict carnivore diet.

2533
02:00:33,490 --> 02:00:34,323
I'm really fascinated by this because 
I'm seeing all these people have all 

2534
02:00:37,001 --> 02:00:39,130
these benefits,
but I am skeptical.

2535
02:00:39,131 --> 02:00:41,100
Hippo face every step of the way.
I'm like,

2536
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:42,430
I'm not know.
Again,

2537
02:00:42,431 --> 02:00:44,890
if it's allowing them to create a 
caloric restriction.

2538
02:00:45,110 --> 02:00:46,540
Right,
and somebody says,

2539
02:00:46,541 --> 02:00:48,730
you know what?
I've tried every other diet out there.

2540
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:51,670
I've tried to eat high fiber and I've 
tried enough vegetables.

2541
02:00:51,671 --> 02:00:54,370
I kept,
but I can stick to this and I can create

2542
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:57,070
and I can lose some fat.
Then I want to say,

2543
02:00:57,071 --> 02:00:58,780
okay,
well maybe that's the best diet for you.

2544
02:00:58,890 --> 02:00:59,723
Well,
I just know so many people that are 

2545
02:01:00,371 --> 02:01:01,980
benefiting from it,
like a,

2546
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:02,671
you know,
and,

2547
02:01:02,671 --> 02:01:04,750
and not just a part of that on the 
podcast.

2548
02:01:04,751 --> 02:01:05,584
So far I know a lot of other people and 
if the members followed by a doctor and 

2549
02:01:08,231 --> 02:01:09,064
collecting blood work along the way,
I mean those doctors can write case 

2550
02:01:11,921 --> 02:01:12,754
reports so I'd be glad to assist in a,
in a case report of people are tracking 

2551
02:01:16,271 --> 02:01:19,810
all their blood markers and doing there,
but most of the people aren't though.

2552
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:20,950
That's what's going on.

2553
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:21,783
Most of these knuckleheads are just 
eating meat and saying they feel great 

2554
02:01:23,711 --> 02:01:28,711
and well there's a war on vegetables.
Like fucking very strange.

2555
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:33,190
Remember that people don't discount 
psychology.

2556
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:36,100
People are feeling very positively about
it because it's the flavor of the month.

2557
02:01:36,260 --> 02:01:37,093
Yeah.
Like,

2558
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:39,950
and I have no hate towards carnivore.
I don't know who the.

2559
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:44,120
I think Dr Baker Zombie one big guy.
Um,

2560
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,540
but you know,
like if I eat hot dogs,

2561
02:01:47,541 --> 02:01:50,090
eat grass.
I mean my dogs go out and eat around the

2562
02:01:50,091 --> 02:01:50,800
grant,
you know,

2563
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:54,350
to get some cat cats are obligate 
carnivores.

2564
02:01:54,351 --> 02:01:56,590
Yeah.
So cats interestingly are one thing that

2565
02:01:56,591 --> 02:01:57,340
yeah,
they don't.

2566
02:01:57,340 --> 02:01:59,480
There is a carb tolerance within.
They don't tolerate them well.

2567
02:01:59,481 --> 02:02:02,480
They'll become obese.
But the Vegan cat.

2568
02:02:03,290 --> 02:02:05,820
So the,
the.

2569
02:02:06,740 --> 02:02:11,740
I think the thing is that I'm not,
I don't believe in any one diet.

2570
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:13,193
I'm not trying to sell anyone dot,
I would like to sell you on a ketogenic 

2571
02:02:16,011 --> 02:02:16,280
diet.

2572
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:17,113
I really want to see you do it for like 
four or five months just to see if 

2573
02:02:18,981 --> 02:02:20,660
you're experiencing the same benefits as
him.

2574
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:24,350
Pretty obvious that you really haven't 
done it like whole hog.

2575
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:26,360
I agree with that.
Totally.

2576
02:02:26,361 --> 02:02:28,610
And I think I could probably put 
together a meal plan,

2577
02:02:28,930 --> 02:02:30,680
Quito,
cookies and things like that.

2578
02:02:30,681 --> 02:02:34,540
Where you thinking cookies.
My cookies.

2579
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:36,280
I did.
I technically like,

2580
02:02:36,430 --> 02:02:37,700
hang on,
hang on.

2581
02:02:38,090 --> 02:02:38,923
See?
I did a ketogenetic diet and it was 

2582
02:02:40,821 --> 02:02:42,770
fine.
I felt fine about two months.

2583
02:02:42,771 --> 02:02:45,200
Didn't stuff suffer that much?
What was your blood markers?

2584
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:48,020
They didn't really change a whole lot 
like I had.

2585
02:02:48,050 --> 02:02:48,883
I think some,
I would consider them insignificant 

2586
02:02:50,511 --> 02:02:53,110
changes.
I maintained um,

2587
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:55,820
about your millimoles.
My melanoma.

2588
02:02:55,850 --> 02:02:56,683
Do Urine Ketones,
blood ketones or did you look at my 

2589
02:02:59,091 --> 02:02:59,720
blood?
I didn't.

2590
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:01,750
I didn't measure those.
Oh,

2591
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:04,100
okay.
I just am your instincts.

2592
02:03:04,570 --> 02:03:05,403
And what stage were you in from moderate
to high in terms of would have been the 

2593
02:03:09,201 --> 02:03:12,770
modified ketogenic diet.
So I would have been not super,

2594
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:15,990
but I would have been barely ketosis.
Yeah,

2595
02:03:16,340 --> 02:03:17,600
I would have been above point Tom 
Wednesday.

2596
02:03:18,470 --> 02:03:19,303
So he's eight weeks into it and that's 
about the point I was kinda feeling 

2597
02:03:22,491 --> 02:03:23,560
crummy and stuff.
But.

2598
02:03:23,570 --> 02:03:24,280
So,
uh,

2599
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:26,810
so I actually ended up three,
well not crummy,

2600
02:03:26,811 --> 02:03:29,450
but I cognitively,
it was kicking in.

2601
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:30,313
Yeah.
But I was a political flag and the gym 

2602
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:35,900
and then it started to fill out and then
it's a learning curve too.

2603
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:36,823
Right.
Let's see.

2604
02:03:36,890 --> 02:03:39,130
My thing was,
if I can get the same,

2605
02:03:39,170 --> 02:03:40,003
if I can get the same benefits just by 
restricting my calories and keeping 

2606
02:03:42,771 --> 02:03:43,604
higher protein,
same fence in terms of cognitive 

2607
02:03:45,861 --> 02:03:47,270
function,
in terms of.

2608
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:48,920
Okay,
well that's science.

2609
02:03:49,070 --> 02:03:51,200
I would say.
I mean we study,

2610
02:03:51,201 --> 02:03:52,034
you could look at pub med,
everything from polycystic ovary 

2611
02:03:54,711 --> 02:03:56,670
syndrome to acne,
you know,

2612
02:03:56,671 --> 02:03:58,520
type two diabetes,
type one diabetes.

2613
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:03,350
Now that's a little bit controversial,
a genetic metabolic Migraines,

2614
02:04:03,351 --> 02:04:04,184
you know,
a whole host of neurological disorders 

2615
02:04:06,291 --> 02:04:07,124
simply because Beta hydroxybutyrate is,
I believe sort of from there is an 

2616
02:04:12,141 --> 02:04:15,140
objective truth that it's a superior 
metabolic fuel and if,

2617
02:04:15,141 --> 02:04:17,420
how do you define nearly molar levels in
your blood,

2618
02:04:17,690 --> 02:04:21,020
that's a significant amount of energy in
your blood that your tissues can use.

2619
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:22,820
How are you defining severe metabolic 
fuel?

2620
02:04:23,470 --> 02:04:28,340
The objective of the Delta g of ATP 
hydrolysis in the heart is enhanced.

2621
02:04:28,341 --> 02:04:32,000
So essentially you're making more ATP 
for a given amount of oxygen,

2622
02:04:32,150 --> 02:04:34,730
just protecting your metabolic rate 
could be slower.

2623
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:38,070
Uh,
maybe you are

2624
02:04:39,050 --> 02:04:40,130
efficient.
Yeah,

2625
02:04:40,170 --> 02:04:42,420
so you're more metabolically efficient 
potentially,

2626
02:04:42,421 --> 02:04:44,880
but I don't think in the context of fat 
loss,

2627
02:04:44,881 --> 02:04:49,440
but it's also enhancing insulin 
sensitivity and simply feeding ketones.

2628
02:04:49,750 --> 02:04:50,583
A independent of carbohydrate 
restriction increases fat oxidation in 

2629
02:04:54,031 --> 02:04:55,500
the muscle.
Those had been published.

2630
02:04:55,530 --> 02:04:56,363
There's bits,
there's been studies to look at like a 

2631
02:04:58,081 --> 02:05:01,140
ketogenetic diet versus a knowledge 
eugenic higher carb diet,

2632
02:05:01,950 --> 02:05:02,783
and they show that basically by going 
kidogenic you reduce overall insulin 

2633
02:05:06,030 --> 02:05:09,180
area under the curve by 20 percent.
That was the number they got.

2634
02:05:09,720 --> 02:05:11,880
Now,
if I was type one diabetic,

2635
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:13,380
I would 100 percent do the kidogenic 
diet.

2636
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:15,030
One hundred percent.
Absolutely.

2637
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:17,340
Okay.
That this is not controversial.

2638
02:05:17,370 --> 02:05:19,540
This is not medical,
this is not medical advice.

2639
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:21,240
And me personally,
I actually,

2640
02:05:21,241 --> 02:05:23,970
when I used to give talks,
I would say for these things,

2641
02:05:23,971 --> 02:05:24,804
but if you're a type one diabetic,
you want to avoid the ketogenic diet as 

2642
02:05:28,231 --> 02:05:30,210
much as possible because there's 
diabetic,

2643
02:05:30,330 --> 02:05:31,163
something called Diabetic Ketoacidosis,
but that's like my student Andrew Cute 

2644
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:37,640
neck at USF as if you've also got a lot 
of insulin.

2645
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:38,513
He has a blog on Keto nutrition.org.
Go to it and it's a very detailed 

2646
02:05:42,871 --> 02:05:43,704
description about carbohydrate 
restriction and managing your blood 

2647
02:05:46,861 --> 02:05:50,390
glucose and it goes into really into the
weeds if you want to reset it.

2648
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:52,920
So can I stop you there though?
Could you elaborate on that?

2649
02:05:52,921 --> 02:05:55,980
So you used to say that if you are type 
one diabetic,

2650
02:05:55,981 --> 02:05:56,814
you wouldn't.
I did because it was very controversial 

2651
02:05:58,681 --> 02:06:01,710
territory.
Describe what a diabetic ketoacidosis.

2652
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:02,573
Yeah.
So if you're type one diabetic you make 

2653
02:06:05,851 --> 02:06:07,920
little or no insulin at all.
Right.

2654
02:06:07,921 --> 02:06:08,700
And,
uh,

2655
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:10,860
I guess maybe just going back to a 
normal person,

2656
02:06:11,070 --> 02:06:13,590
when they fast or they do the kidogenic 
diet,

2657
02:06:13,890 --> 02:06:14,723
it increases fat oxidation in the liver 
and that fat oxidation actually 

2658
02:06:18,091 --> 02:06:20,790
accumulates Acetol Coa Aa and that 
creates ketones,

2659
02:06:20,791 --> 02:06:21,624
acetoacetate and Beta hydroxybutyrate,
and it curves in the context of insulin 

2660
02:06:24,721 --> 02:06:27,000
suppression.
But you're still abnormal insulin,

2661
02:06:27,001 --> 02:06:28,860
but it's very low,
right?

2662
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:31,200
Uh,
and then when your ketones get elevated,

2663
02:06:31,201 --> 02:06:33,960
you spill some out in the urine and 
that's how you eliminate them.

2664
02:06:33,990 --> 02:06:35,640
Your muscles,
your brain burns them.

2665
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:38,450
And if they get really high,
you have a,

2666
02:06:38,490 --> 02:06:41,700
an increase in.
It's a small increase in insulin release

2667
02:06:41,730 --> 02:06:42,563
when your ketones get real high and that
insulin ramps down fat oxidation in the 

2668
02:06:46,291 --> 02:06:49,290
liver and decreases ketone production.
So,

2669
02:06:49,291 --> 02:06:50,124
and there's other things too,
but I don't want to get too much into 

2670
02:06:51,541 --> 02:06:53,400
the weeds,
but you're a very,

2671
02:06:53,401 --> 02:06:56,220
a normal person is finely tuned to 
create,

2672
02:06:56,490 --> 02:06:57,323
to maintain physiological ketones within
a certain range with nutritional 

2673
02:07:00,871 --> 02:07:02,580
ketosis,
with diabetic,

2674
02:07:02,670 --> 02:07:05,430
a type one diabetes that's completely 
thrown out the window.

2675
02:07:05,610 --> 02:07:08,670
So without insulin being there,
uh,

2676
02:07:08,671 --> 02:07:12,050
the absence of insulin essentially 
creates runaway ketogenesis.

2677
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:12,893
And your ketones become very,
very high in the context of very high 

2678
02:07:16,261 --> 02:07:17,340
glucose.
Exactly.

2679
02:07:17,370 --> 02:07:19,800
So you have high glucose and high 
ketones.

2680
02:07:19,830 --> 02:07:24,240
It creates a metabolic,
a disruption.

2681
02:07:24,241 --> 02:07:25,074
It creates an acidotic state and 
electrolyte imbalances and coma and 

2682
02:07:28,831 --> 02:07:29,664
death,
which is not going to happen in people 

2683
02:07:31,141 --> 02:07:33,360
who are healthy,
who are just doing a ketogenic diet.

2684
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:34,200
Right?
But,

2685
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:37,960
but is the type one diabetes,
if you,

2686
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:39,970
for example,
my student,

2687
02:07:40,050 --> 02:07:40,883
uh,
using his own example because I think 

2688
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:45,280
maybe he was using 20 or 30,
I use of insulin a day,

2689
02:07:45,510 --> 02:07:48,190
right?
And then starts carbohydrate restriction

2690
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:49,113
and even a modified ketogenic diet and 
can reduce that insulin requirement to 

2691
02:07:54,430 --> 02:07:55,151
four,
five,

2692
02:07:55,151 --> 02:07:56,080
six.
I use a day.

2693
02:07:56,140 --> 02:08:01,140
So literally knocking it down to 20 
percent of what he would have changed in

2694
02:08:01,691 --> 02:08:04,560
your perception when you did not 
recommend it a beat.

2695
02:08:04,561 --> 02:08:05,394
Well,
there's a Harvard study that basically 

2696
02:08:06,431 --> 02:08:09,610
looked at a group called type one grit 
on facebook.

2697
02:08:09,611 --> 02:08:14,290
There was a group called type one grit 
and it's got thousands of people who use

2698
02:08:14,291 --> 02:08:15,124
a low carbohydrate approach,
not necessarily a ketogenic diet 

2699
02:08:18,131 --> 02:08:18,580
approach.

2700
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:19,690
Some are,
uh,

2701
02:08:19,691 --> 02:08:24,691
but it's very carbohydrate restricted in
terms of what a doctor,

2702
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:29,050
an endocrinologist would prescribe for a
type one diabetic.

2703
02:08:29,051 --> 02:08:29,884
It would almost make it look like 
suicide to some people and low 

2704
02:08:32,441 --> 02:08:36,250
carbohydrate dramatically decreases your
insulin requirements.

2705
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:37,413
And if you look at your continuous blood
glucose recordings over the course of a 

2706
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:42,880
week,
those numbers are much,

2707
02:08:42,881 --> 02:08:43,714
much tighter and that's going to pay 
huge dividends in the long run when it 

2708
02:08:46,901 --> 02:08:47,734
comes to a longevity and health span.
And you know the potential for going 

2709
02:08:52,511 --> 02:08:54,550
blind or decreasing your kidney 
function,

2710
02:08:54,551 --> 02:08:56,710
you know,
buy these huge post prandial spikes.

2711
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:58,060
Essentially.
If you're type one day,

2712
02:08:58,090 --> 02:09:01,060
you're always chasing your glucose with 
insulin injections,

2713
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:02,230
right?
Or an insulin pump.

2714
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:06,990
If you're carbohydrate restricted,
you're basically not it.

2715
02:09:07,010 --> 02:09:10,630
It's very liberating because you're not.
Your dependence on insulin is far,

2716
02:09:10,631 --> 02:09:11,630
far less,
you know,

2717
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,513
some controversially,
some people have gotten completely off 

2718
02:09:15,641 --> 02:09:17,230
of insulin.
I would not recommend that,

2719
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:18,610
but some people are actually doing that.

2720
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:19,940
So the,
the,

2721
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:21,980
I think,
highly not recommended.

2722
02:09:21,981 --> 02:09:24,740
I hear this from critics,
critics of the kidogenic diet,

2723
02:09:24,830 --> 02:09:27,620
and this is a BS criticism.
The again,

2724
02:09:27,650 --> 02:09:30,170
here's me defending the ketogenic diet 
is well,

2725
02:09:30,171 --> 02:09:30,770
you'll,
you'll be,

2726
02:09:30,770 --> 02:09:35,770
you'll become a people who are healthy,
you'll have diabetic ketoacidosis.

2727
02:09:36,290 --> 02:09:38,420
That is not going to happen because by 
definition,

2728
02:09:38,421 --> 02:09:41,150
if your ketones are high and your health
and you're relatively healthy,

2729
02:09:41,151 --> 02:09:43,850
not type one diabetic,
your blood glucose is low.

2730
02:09:44,570 --> 02:09:47,480
It's when both are elevated that it's 
dangerous.

2731
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:49,670
Okay,
and if you're a type one diabetic,

2732
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:53,900
like Andrew who are just using a little 
bit of insulin to get that baseline,

2733
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:55,033
so get your glucose levels down to a 
baseline level and then you're using a 

2734
02:09:58,131 --> 02:10:01,850
carb restricted diet that creates 
ketones while your blood glucose.

2735
02:10:01,851 --> 02:10:06,851
Is that a normal basal level that again,
not a Dr Medical Advice,

2736
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:09,650
that should not be dangerous

2737
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:13,950
right now over the years because he's a 
power lifter and he's a super big dude.

2738
02:10:13,951 --> 02:10:16,980
He's like 250 pounds.
Like when he goes to the gym,

2739
02:10:16,981 --> 02:10:17,814
he has learned that he can pulse a 
little bit of insulin and maybe ramp up 

2740
02:10:20,581 --> 02:10:23,100
is protein or maybe even take it a 
little bit of carbohydrates,

2741
02:10:23,101 --> 02:10:23,934
but you know,
the next day he's still doing low carb 

2742
02:10:25,681 --> 02:10:28,140
throughout the day.
But he's learned to leverage,

2743
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:29,730
you know,
as a type one diabetic,

2744
02:10:30,090 --> 02:10:31,050
you,
uh,

2745
02:10:31,051 --> 02:10:32,190
you have that advantage,
right?

2746
02:10:32,191 --> 02:10:33,024
Because you can manipulate for body 
composition alterations or things like 

2747
02:10:36,471 --> 02:10:37,820
that.
So he,

2748
02:10:37,821 --> 02:10:38,654
uh,
he has learned to adjust his protein to 

2749
02:10:40,551 --> 02:10:43,310
maximize his sort of gains and 
performance in the gym.

2750
02:10:43,790 --> 02:10:46,730
And uh,
but nonetheless he goes from,

2751
02:10:47,090 --> 02:10:51,320
he went from a strategy,
he transitioned to a strategy that would

2752
02:10:51,321 --> 02:10:55,670
be a,
we'd look to be almost suicidal from the

2753
02:10:55,671 --> 02:10:56,504
perspective of an endocrinologist,
doctor managing type one to do that 

2754
02:10:59,541 --> 02:11:02,870
level of carbohydrate restriction would 
be a.

2755
02:11:02,870 --> 02:11:07,250
and now we actually have hard science to
show that that can not only can be done,

2756
02:11:07,490 --> 02:11:08,323
that gets that dramatically decreases 
the variability of your blood glucose 

2757
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:16,580
fluctuations throughout the day from a 
weekly perspective and your requirements

2758
02:11:16,581 --> 02:11:17,414
for insulin.
Whenever you could use less insulin to 

2759
02:11:19,341 --> 02:11:21,500
manage your blood glucose,
that's a good thing.

2760
02:11:21,710 --> 02:11:25,900
I would say it's very hard for a doctor 
to argue against any type.

2761
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:29,480
Would I be using less insulin and 
keeping tighter numbers?

2762
02:11:29,481 --> 02:11:34,330
There's no way to argue against that.
So if you can follow the Diet so that it

2763
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:35,740
gets back to adherence again.
Right?

2764
02:11:35,770 --> 02:11:36,181
Right.
Again,

2765
02:11:36,181 --> 02:11:39,960
so it's one of those things,
like you said,

2766
02:11:39,961 --> 02:11:42,600
I'd like to see you try it and do it 
whatnot.

2767
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:44,460
And you know what?
I would probably be fine,

2768
02:11:44,580 --> 02:11:49,290
but I enjoy having a variety of foods 
and I enjoy having a variety of fuels as

2769
02:11:49,291 --> 02:11:49,771
well.
No,

2770
02:11:49,771 --> 02:11:51,780
I'm sure you do,
but I'd still like to see you try it.

2771
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:56,550
Like those two are mutually exclusive.
You're right.

2772
02:11:56,610 --> 02:11:57,970
But I liked having a scientist

2773
02:11:58,060 --> 02:12:00,820
chapter in his book that's coming out 
that we worked,

2774
02:12:00,850 --> 02:12:02,590
you know,
tea together and uh,

2775
02:12:02,660 --> 02:12:03,493
just took some of the concepts that I've
don't you find here your preferences 

2776
02:12:06,491 --> 02:12:08,680
change as well,
like in terms of your hunger pangs,

2777
02:12:08,710 --> 02:12:10,840
you're not,
you don't crave sugary foods,

2778
02:12:10,841 --> 02:12:12,520
carbohydrates,
but you do.

2779
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:13,810
You like them?

2780
02:12:13,810 --> 02:12:14,643
Yeah.
Look at you like I'm getting hungry 

2781
02:12:18,730 --> 02:12:20,820
thinking about it.
Oh my God.

2782
02:12:20,830 --> 02:12:22,570
Give me the sugar.
Whereas the pizza,

2783
02:12:22,670 --> 02:12:24,970
uh,
no I don't.

2784
02:12:24,971 --> 02:12:26,140
When did you have for breakfast this 
morning?

2785
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:29,920
What did I have for breakfast spot?
I had a steak and eggs.

2786
02:12:31,030 --> 02:12:33,630
There you go.
And the toast.

2787
02:12:33,940 --> 02:12:34,691
Toast.
Oh,

2788
02:12:34,691 --> 02:12:36,000
you son of a bitch.
Stabbed.

2789
02:12:36,400 --> 02:12:38,230
Stab him in.
The face is wrong with you.

2790
02:12:38,231 --> 02:12:39,640
Why don't you know,
Spike.

2791
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:44,680
Big serving of nothing.
So lots of energy.

2792
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:46,020
Again,
it's,

2793
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:46,940
it's,
it's,

2794
02:12:47,110 --> 02:12:50,890
it's individual.
And I want to point out that if somebody

2795
02:12:50,891 --> 02:12:53,260
likes a kid and I've had people do 
ketogenic diet,

2796
02:12:53,380 --> 02:12:54,213
I've had people you know,
get ready for shows and the key to take 

2797
02:12:56,110 --> 02:12:59,230
time that why did you put them on 
occasion because that's what they liked.

2798
02:12:59,620 --> 02:13:00,131
They were,
they were,

2799
02:13:00,131 --> 02:13:00,964
they had that preference for that.
And it got to a point where for some 

2800
02:13:03,761 --> 02:13:06,700
people their calories get so low if they
have slow metabolic rates,

2801
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:11,260
that the level of fat restriction it 
would take them to is probably not great

2802
02:13:11,261 --> 02:13:12,094
for hormone levels.
So I tended to pull a little bit more 

2803
02:13:14,981 --> 02:13:18,460
carb relative to fat and so we didn't 
start out targeted them as key to Jenny,

2804
02:13:18,461 --> 02:13:21,460
but by the end they were um,
so,

2805
02:13:21,780 --> 02:13:22,380
you know,

2806
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:25,260
so you had to resort to something that 
actually works.

2807
02:13:25,740 --> 02:13:26,573
Oh,
stop it,

2808
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:28,580
stop it.
Stop

2809
02:13:28,950 --> 02:13:31,860
Basal metabolic because metabolic 
declines.

2810
02:13:31,861 --> 02:13:33,540
You get to a point that you get to a 
point,

2811
02:13:33,570 --> 02:13:36,820
especially to get that lean.
I mean I'm somebody who's a,

2812
02:13:37,490 --> 02:13:40,140
like again,
more average muscle mass and pretty fast

2813
02:13:40,141 --> 02:13:40,974
metabolism.
Usually I had to get down to like under 

2814
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:46,680
2000 calories a day to get,
to get ready for a show.

2815
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:50,310
So for me I was,
I had my carbohydrates for briefly under

2816
02:13:50,311 --> 02:13:53,270
100 grams of carbs per day in that show 
prep December.

2817
02:13:53,380 --> 02:13:54,213
But I was sober.
I was sticking your fingers and 

2818
02:13:55,561 --> 02:13:56,394
measuring your glucose in the bathroom.
I forget where my theory is that when 

2819
02:13:59,731 --> 02:14:02,220
you do that and you carb restrict and 
you will,

2820
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:04,620
you calorie restrict rather and get 
down,

2821
02:14:04,650 --> 02:14:05,483
he wants that shit's over.
You just want to reward yourself as 

2822
02:14:08,401 --> 02:14:09,234
often as possible.
So when someone comes along with 

2823
02:14:10,381 --> 02:14:12,390
something like a key to genic diet and 
go,

2824
02:14:12,391 --> 02:14:13,490
no bread,
no pop,

2825
02:14:13,530 --> 02:14:14,970
fuck you,
you just,

2826
02:14:14,971 --> 02:14:16,110
you just don't want to do it.

2827
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:18,840
You get,
but you get the same.

2828
02:14:19,620 --> 02:14:20,453
Uh,
the adherence and the relapse is the 

2829
02:14:22,861 --> 02:14:25,540
same whether it's key to genic or 
another diet relapse,

2830
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,510
like regaining weight,
again,

2831
02:14:29,930 --> 02:14:34,930
like Pasta and bread because there's no,
no foods actually create.

2832
02:14:35,870 --> 02:14:37,620
They've sent,
they have great stuff there.

2833
02:14:37,621 --> 02:14:40,950
Waffles are excellent.
They have like a hamburger buns now.

2834
02:14:41,250 --> 02:14:44,850
Anything I really like,
I've made sandwiches with their stuff.

2835
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:47,760
Um,
what knocks me out more than anything of

2836
02:14:47,761 --> 02:14:50,130
Ketosis is just too much meat.
Yeah.

2837
02:14:50,420 --> 02:14:51,680
Yeah.
Genesis,

2838
02:14:52,170 --> 02:14:55,920
that's the one that gets me.
Again,

2839
02:14:55,921 --> 02:15:00,921
I,
I kind of go back to that.

2840
02:15:01,321 --> 02:15:04,320
The data is very mixed.
Again,

2841
02:15:04,321 --> 02:15:05,154
if we look at the overall data set,
very mixed and all diets have terrible 

2842
02:15:08,191 --> 02:15:09,280
adherence,
right?

2843
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:11,970
But a lot of that.
And that's discipline.

2844
02:15:12,690 --> 02:15:13,650
Yeah.
But we also,

2845
02:15:13,710 --> 02:15:16,140
now we've got some crazy.
I don't want to talk about people aren't

2846
02:15:16,141 --> 02:15:17,210
disciplined really,
really.

2847
02:15:17,310 --> 02:15:20,820
I really have a giant hard problem,
but how does it know so many disciplined

2848
02:15:20,821 --> 02:15:22,020
people?
And I just,

2849
02:15:22,021 --> 02:15:25,350
I feel their momentum and vibration and 
I'm like,

2850
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:26,193
I just want to concentrate on what 
they're doing because all these people 

2851
02:15:27,751 --> 02:15:30,300
that can't do it,
I feel like that's contagious.

2852
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:33,360
You started thinking about people that 
can adhere to diets and fall off.

2853
02:15:33,390 --> 02:15:36,630
I get it for you because it's something 
that you do professionally.

2854
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:40,290
But I'm gonna.
I'm gonna make it so for you,

2855
02:15:40,291 --> 02:15:41,124
the ketogenic diet clicks or,
or eating more meat clicks that that's 

2856
02:15:44,521 --> 02:15:47,380
something that you really enjoy.
You like the state you lost.

2857
02:15:47,660 --> 02:15:48,690
Dude,
I love Pasta.

2858
02:15:48,750 --> 02:15:53,750
It makes discipline easier because the 
data doesn't support that.

2859
02:15:56,251 --> 02:15:57,084
It makes discipline easier in terms of 
your adherence or in terms of your 

2860
02:15:59,911 --> 02:16:01,530
longterm adherence?
Both.

2861
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:03,570
Both.
So but,

2862
02:16:03,571 --> 02:16:04,800
but hang on,
hang on.

2863
02:16:04,950 --> 02:16:05,783
For some people,
for some people this works better 

2864
02:16:09,330 --> 02:16:10,163
because they feel better.
They have better adherence for other 

2865
02:16:12,991 --> 02:16:15,610
people.
If you say now you've got some people,

2866
02:16:15,611 --> 02:16:16,171
if you say,
hey,

2867
02:16:16,171 --> 02:16:17,990
you can have a cookie.
It would,

2868
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:20,820
it would screw them because they would,
they would just go crazy.

2869
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:22,013
But for other people,
if you allow them more flexibility 

2870
02:16:23,730 --> 02:16:24,660
there,
adherence improves.

2871
02:16:24,661 --> 02:16:28,620
What I'm saying is we need to give 
people all the options on the table,

2872
02:16:28,650 --> 02:16:30,160
not demonize any one

2873
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:32,620
diet and say,
hey,

2874
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:37,240
maybe you try to figure out what works 
for lack of sounding Bro,

2875
02:16:37,390 --> 02:16:40,420
what works for you and what you can 
sustain.

2876
02:16:41,050 --> 02:16:43,750
Go from there,
but see this is totally in agreement.

2877
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:45,550
I am as well,
but you keep saying,

2878
02:16:45,580 --> 02:16:48,640
Ken sustained.
You definitely can sustain more than you

2879
02:16:48,641 --> 02:16:49,474
do that.
The real problem is a giant percentage 

2880
02:16:52,061 --> 02:16:53,560
of the people are weak.
Oh,

2881
02:16:53,561 --> 02:16:55,450
I would agree with that.
I guess in the 30,

2882
02:16:55,451 --> 02:16:57,850
40 percent people just quit,
give up,

2883
02:16:57,851 --> 02:16:58,684
don't do what they're supposed to do,
don't do as many reps as it's supposed 

2884
02:17:01,241 --> 02:17:02,074
to do.
Don't work out and take days off just 

2885
02:17:03,940 --> 02:17:06,760
because they're lazy and those are the 
people that get off the Diet.

2886
02:17:06,761 --> 02:17:08,350
It's a discipline issue more than 
anything.

2887
02:17:08,410 --> 02:17:09,243
The that is really big.
So I think various foods that are 

2888
02:17:12,181 --> 02:17:15,000
emerging on the market right now at base
systems,

2889
02:17:15,030 --> 02:17:15,863
Virta health actually has a great app 
based system that actually coaches you 

2890
02:17:18,601 --> 02:17:21,060
through that and I think that's very 
helpful.

2891
02:17:21,150 --> 02:17:21,983
So I think new technologies,
foods and we'll make it will increase 

2892
02:17:26,131 --> 02:17:27,150
adherence.
Also,

2893
02:17:27,151 --> 02:17:27,984
when you have a person who knows and 
understands all the health benefits 

2894
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:33,360
associated with nutritional ketosis or 
just a low carb,

2895
02:17:33,390 --> 02:17:36,750
I think that can be a motivating factor 
to make them stick to the Diet,

2896
02:17:37,350 --> 02:17:39,870
but for a guy like you who's rational 
and discipline,

2897
02:17:39,871 --> 02:17:41,970
but people their self destructive and 
weak,

2898
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:47,360
they're going to need a burger and fries
and need to share their choice.

2899
02:17:49,590 --> 02:17:51,420
What's the point of the whole 
conversation than the well,

2900
02:17:51,421 --> 02:17:52,254
the part of their conversations to avoid
those motherfuckers because they're 

2901
02:17:53,851 --> 02:17:56,100
going to drag you down to their mediocre
level.

2902
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:01,950
I think you need to sympathize with them
a little bit because I think the market,

2903
02:18:01,951 --> 02:18:06,951
and I think this is a fruitful area for 
entrepreneurs to create technologies and

2904
02:18:07,471 --> 02:18:11,700
foods that can actually enhance 
adherence to stop eating strategies.

2905
02:18:11,701 --> 02:18:14,220
We know about that too,
so it's a combination.

2906
02:18:14,630 --> 02:18:17,210
How much of it is what you're willing to
accept from yourself.

2907
02:18:17,420 --> 02:18:18,253
If you're.
If you are willing to accept this 

2908
02:18:19,300 --> 02:18:24,050
seesaw,
obesity thing that so many people get on

2909
02:18:24,110 --> 02:18:27,320
on and off this Yoyo effect.
If you're willing to accept that,

2910
02:18:27,650 --> 02:18:28,483
that's fine,
but I just feel like it's a mental 

2911
02:18:30,921 --> 02:18:31,940
state.
I really do.

2912
02:18:31,941 --> 02:18:32,774
I see.
Once you achieve a certain amount of 

2913
02:18:34,071 --> 02:18:36,230
success,
people start sabotaging themselves.

2914
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:37,333
They start,
they start dwelling on the fact that 

2915
02:18:39,111 --> 02:18:41,600
they're doing well,
but how long can they sustain this?

2916
02:18:41,770 --> 02:18:46,190
I starts being a big fat mind fuck,
and that's when you say like,

2917
02:18:46,191 --> 02:18:48,230
what's sustainable?
What's this data?

2918
02:18:48,231 --> 02:18:51,490
A lot more than you're willing to do 
what sustainable is?

2919
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,353
Stove yell a bit.
The person out there that's listening 

2920
02:18:54,471 --> 02:18:55,910
knows,
but you know what I mean?

2921
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:56,953
It's like there's a thing like we're 
giving people these fucking escape 

2922
02:18:59,930 --> 02:19:01,910
clauses.
We're giving them these,

2923
02:19:01,911 --> 02:19:04,010
these,
these parachutes they can pull.

2924
02:19:04,190 --> 02:19:07,670
Don't pull the parachute motherfucker.
Just have a cheat day.

2925
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:10,100
That's fine,
but don't get off your diet.

2926
02:19:10,101 --> 02:19:11,150
Have a cheat meal,
you know,

2927
02:19:11,151 --> 02:19:14,150
fucking giant Sunday.
Throw some syrup on that bitch.

2928
02:19:14,151 --> 02:19:16,250
Get that whip cream going.
Do it once,

2929
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:21,400
but don't live your life like that.
That's nonsense and I think that for.

2930
02:19:22,910 --> 02:19:23,743
Yeah,
I wouldn't disagree with anything you 

2931
02:19:24,321 --> 02:19:26,060
said.
People need to hear.

2932
02:19:26,061 --> 02:19:27,590
Not this like this.
Like,

2933
02:19:27,591 --> 02:19:28,100
well,
you

2934
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:28,933
can't sustain it.
The Quito giant Sam Houston state to 

2935
02:19:31,830 --> 02:19:35,170
state their control.
If you do sustainable,

2936
02:19:35,270 --> 02:19:36,103
if you found for three days,
that will give you a lot of confidence 

2937
02:19:38,541 --> 02:19:41,750
that you have control over food fasting 
for three days.

2938
02:19:41,751 --> 02:19:42,584
No Diet is sustainable.
It's not sustainable over if you look 

2939
02:19:44,931 --> 02:19:45,764
for the general population and you get a
bunch of weak bitches and you get them 

2940
02:19:48,621 --> 02:19:49,454
together,
how many of them are going to keep it 

2941
02:19:50,061 --> 02:19:50,894
together?
How many of them are going to run 

2942
02:19:51,111 --> 02:19:51,944
everyday?
How many of you going to work out every 

2943
02:19:52,491 --> 02:19:53,301
day?
Very,

2944
02:19:53,301 --> 02:19:54,230
very,
very few.

2945
02:19:54,231 --> 02:19:56,450
You're dealing with outliers in 
particular.

2946
02:19:56,570 --> 02:19:57,403
Just by virtue of what you do,
how many people are willing to put the 

2947
02:20:00,261 --> 02:20:03,710
work in to achieve this?
That not how many,

2948
02:20:04,070 --> 02:20:05,450
how many people are gonna achieve this 
physique?

2949
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:06,980
Very,
very few.

2950
02:20:06,981 --> 02:20:09,380
Right?
So we're talking about outliers.

2951
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:10,393
We're talking about how.

2952
02:20:10,460 --> 02:20:12,320
That's what I like.
I like outliers.

2953
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:17,470
I don't like people that are good to 
hear that that's dangerous,

2954
02:20:18,620 --> 02:20:19,453
so like that shit is worse than carbs.
That's why we talk a lot in the book 

2955
02:20:22,911 --> 02:20:26,060
about behaviors because if you change 
your behavior,

2956
02:20:26,510 --> 02:20:27,343
that's what we,
I think there's not enough research 

2957
02:20:28,971 --> 02:20:29,804
focused on is let's look at the people 
who actually achieve weight loss and if 

2958
02:20:33,591 --> 02:20:35,210
you look at people who achieve it and 
keep it off,

2959
02:20:35,510 --> 02:20:37,040
they do it through many different 
methods,

2960
02:20:37,041 --> 02:20:38,510
whether it's low carb,
low fat,

2961
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:39,373
whatever it is,
but let's look at the behaviors that 

2962
02:20:41,691 --> 02:20:44,600
they make and those behaviors can tell 
us a lot about people.

2963
02:20:44,601 --> 02:20:45,434
One thing we know is they practice.
They've made themselves very often they 

2964
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:50,953
so they're accountable.
They practice some form of cognitive 

2965
02:20:54,111 --> 02:20:55,850
restraint,
whether it's weighing food,

2966
02:20:55,851 --> 02:20:58,970
recording macros,
ketogenic fat restriction,

2967
02:20:58,971 --> 02:20:59,804
whatever it is,
and also they exercise regularly and 

2968
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:04,573
one,
there's physiological benefits to that 

2969
02:21:05,541 --> 02:21:09,440
exercise lowers the body fat set point 
that your body will defend.

2970
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:11,720
So it actually has a physiological 
benefit,

2971
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:15,260
but also just mentally like you said.
I mean I never.

2972
02:21:15,261 --> 02:21:17,960
If you took me back 30 years ago and you
told me,

2973
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:18,920
hey,
les,

2974
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:20,690
or when I was 10 years old and you said,
hey,

2975
02:21:20,930 --> 02:21:23,540
when I was bullied and picked on,
had no self esteem,

2976
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:24,793
you're gonna fucking squat,
668 pounds one day on your back at 201 

2977
02:21:29,361 --> 02:21:32,330
pounds and set a.
it's been broken since then,

2978
02:21:32,331 --> 02:21:34,610
but a world record,
I would have been like,

2979
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:36,980
there's no fucking way.
There's no way,

2980
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:41,210
but when you have disciplined like you 
said and you that doesn't,

2981
02:21:41,211 --> 02:21:43,130
just people say you should have more 
confidence.

2982
02:21:43,430 --> 02:21:47,180
That's a fucking horseshit advice.
Confidence is built through.

2983
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:48,193
You set a goal and you achieve.
You set a goal and achieve it and you 

2984
02:21:50,331 --> 02:21:51,164
don't start out to say,
I'm going to set a world record and 

2985
02:21:52,941 --> 02:21:53,930
that's your first goal.

2986
02:21:54,440 --> 02:21:55,340
You.
I like,

2987
02:21:55,341 --> 02:21:56,174
what will Smith say?
Say you lay a brick as perfectly as you 

2988
02:21:57,921 --> 02:21:58,754
can.
Lay it.

2989
02:21:58,910 --> 02:21:59,743
You do it again and you do it again and 
you do it again and you talked to 

2990
02:22:02,180 --> 02:22:06,350
anybody who's successful in anything.
They didn't start out saying,

2991
02:22:06,950 --> 02:22:09,820
I'm going to do this earth shattering 
thing right?

2992
02:22:09,890 --> 02:22:10,723
They started out and built that 
confidence over years and years of 

2993
02:22:14,450 --> 02:22:17,210
achieving small goals,
which then led them to their big goal.

2994
02:22:17,211 --> 02:22:18,044
Now we're onto something because I think
that the mental state in which you 

2995
02:22:20,151 --> 02:22:22,160
approach anything,
a workout routine,

2996
02:22:22,190 --> 02:22:24,350
a lifestyle,
the way you decide to live your life,

2997
02:22:24,351 --> 02:22:26,940
that is,
and here's one of the things that people

2998
02:22:26,941 --> 02:22:27,774
are cynical about.
That's probably one of the best sources 

2999
02:22:30,091 --> 02:22:30,924
of fuel,
is inspiration from other motivated 

3000
02:22:33,001 --> 02:22:33,834
people.
Go to David Goggins instagram page 

3001
02:22:35,630 --> 02:22:37,770
everyday.
Watch that fucking savage.

3002
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:40,680
Watch what he does and yeah,
he's awesome,

3003
02:22:40,830 --> 02:22:42,180
but go to people like him.

3004
02:22:42,210 --> 02:22:43,043
Cameron Hanes,
go to go to go to the rock like these 

3005
02:22:46,141 --> 02:22:47,940
fucking people.
Just do it.

3006
02:22:48,180 --> 02:22:51,270
There's no escape.
There's no acute sustain that.

3007
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:53,100
That's not.
I don't want to hear that shit.

3008
02:22:53,460 --> 02:22:55,170
That's nonsense.
Failing is good.

3009
02:22:55,171 --> 02:22:56,220
It's okay.
If you fail,

3010
02:22:57,330 --> 02:22:59,140
then you're not going to get back on the
horse.

3011
02:22:59,141 --> 02:23:03,240
You're not pushing yourself hard enough.
When I say sustainability,

3012
02:23:03,690 --> 02:23:04,740
I mean if,
if it's,

3013
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:07,920
if it's because everybody has stuff that
they find,

3014
02:23:07,921 --> 02:23:08,754
again,
you find a carb restricted diet to be 

3015
02:23:10,171 --> 02:23:12,650
easier to stick to three feels better 
for it,

3016
02:23:12,820 --> 02:23:14,280
better for you,
and that's fine,

3017
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:16,410
but if,
but if somebody is over here and says,

3018
02:23:16,411 --> 02:23:17,820
you know what,
I'm eating a low fat diet.

3019
02:23:17,910 --> 02:23:19,860
I feel great.
My blood markers are good.

3020
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:22,740
I have plenty of energy.
What's wrong with that?

3021
02:23:22,950 --> 02:23:26,270
Nothing's wrong with that.
There's well Libertarian,

3022
02:23:26,380 --> 02:23:28,770
oh,
unquestionably exists,

3023
02:23:28,830 --> 02:23:29,430
right?
There's A.

3024
02:23:29,430 --> 02:23:31,220
There's a giant difference between all 
of this.

3025
02:23:31,260 --> 02:23:33,090
Some people eat peanuts and they die,
right?

3026
02:23:33,190 --> 02:23:34,450
We all know that.
There's just.

3027
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:36,300
The body's just very,
very different.

3028
02:23:36,301 --> 02:23:39,120
They're very exactly their caloric 
requirements,

3029
02:23:39,260 --> 02:23:41,540
the nutritional requirements,
it.

3030
02:23:41,550 --> 02:23:42,840
That's what's hard about this,
right?

3031
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:47,040
Is Finding this one thing that is best 
for you.

3032
02:23:47,210 --> 02:23:49,500
Yes.
And objectively and you know,

3033
02:23:49,501 --> 02:23:53,010
and being really analyzing your,
your actual physical performance,

3034
02:23:53,011 --> 02:23:54,720
which very,
very few people do.

3035
02:23:54,870 --> 02:23:55,651
They kind of say,
well,

3036
02:23:55,651 --> 02:23:57,780
I feel pretty good,
but by what marker,

3037
02:23:57,830 --> 02:23:58,440
right?
Are you,

3038
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:01,200
what's your personal best?
What are you trying to accomplish?

3039
02:24:01,201 --> 02:24:03,700
Are you monitoring your heart rate?
Are you monitoring your workout?

3040
02:24:03,701 --> 02:24:07,230
Put like what are you doing to show that
this diet is optimal for you?

3041
02:24:07,540 --> 02:24:08,730
Yeah.
Well,

3042
02:24:08,731 --> 02:24:10,110
and part of that is like a,
you know,

3043
02:24:10,410 --> 02:24:11,243
it's hard to get a lot of money that's 
going to be spent to get that data for 

3044
02:24:15,541 --> 02:24:16,110
an individual.

3045
02:24:16,110 --> 02:24:19,440
So part of it is going to have to be 
what do you feel good on and what do you

3046
02:24:19,441 --> 02:24:20,274
feel like is again,
most sustainable for you because no 

3047
02:24:24,241 --> 02:24:28,020
matter what that people want to diet,
what people really want is they want,

3048
02:24:28,290 --> 02:24:29,123
I don't want to have to track and I 
don't wanna have to sacrifice anything 

3049
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:32,940
and I want to get to my goal.
Well,

3050
02:24:32,970 --> 02:24:34,050
tough shit.
That's not going to happen.

3051
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:36,150
You have to pick what you're going to 
sacrifice,

3052
02:24:36,151 --> 02:24:37,410
right?
So if you say,

3053
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:41,650
I hate tracking calories so I'm just not
going to eat carbs because I,

3054
02:24:41,651 --> 02:24:44,520
I can regulate my body weight that way.
Fuck yeah,

3055
02:24:44,521 --> 02:24:45,354
do that.
I had a post on twitter that was one of 

3056
02:24:46,901 --> 02:24:48,480
my most popular twitter posts.
I said,

3057
02:24:48,870 --> 02:24:49,703
you know,
health improvements are largely driven 

3058
02:24:51,331 --> 02:24:55,150
by caloric restriction and weight loss,
but if,

3059
02:24:55,480 --> 02:24:59,190
if you like Vegan,
if you like Quito Carnivore,

3060
02:24:59,220 --> 02:25:03,450
if you and I just listed a bunch of 
different diets and they help you create

3061
02:25:03,451 --> 02:25:06,330
a restriction and it keeps you at a 
healthy weight,

3062
02:25:07,110 --> 02:25:08,400
then fuck yeah.

3063
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:10,920
Hell yeah.
Like if somebody says,

3064
02:25:10,921 --> 02:25:13,590
I like eating a Vegan Diet,
I'm not interested in losing weight,

3065
02:25:13,591 --> 02:25:16,410
but Ketogenic,
intermittent fasting is very,

3066
02:25:16,411 --> 02:25:17,244
very easy for me.
I loved the food and I feel better and 

3067
02:25:19,761 --> 02:25:20,594
uh,
I think all my biomarkers are improving 

3068
02:25:22,890 --> 02:25:23,723
when,
when you don't need any other reasoning 

3069
02:25:24,550 --> 02:25:26,620
for why you should do it with him.
It works.

3070
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:27,760
Now.
Can I ask you this?

3071
02:25:27,761 --> 02:25:28,594
When you say diets aren't sustainable,
the data doesn't show that what you're 

3072
02:25:30,321 --> 02:25:31,154
talking about,
calorie restricted diets that overall 

3073
02:25:32,590 --> 02:25:35,470
weight loss diets.
Are you talking about dietary choices in

3074
02:25:35,471 --> 02:25:37,990
terms of like key to genic direct 
question.

3075
02:25:38,380 --> 02:25:42,670
So it's that if you lose weight,
we cannot keep it off.

3076
02:25:42,910 --> 02:25:43,743
That is,
that is the big problem is that most 

3077
02:25:46,451 --> 02:25:51,280
people are able to lose weight and they 
cannot keep it off because one,

3078
02:25:51,320 --> 02:25:55,600
the self defense system that we talked 
about is really weight too quickly.

3079
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:58,510
Their body gets into this state where 
it's always trying to regain that weight

3080
02:25:58,511 --> 02:25:59,560
back.
Part of it,

3081
02:25:59,561 --> 02:26:00,371
part of it,
yeah,

3082
02:26:00,371 --> 02:26:04,120
like losing it more quickly.
There's debate about this,

3083
02:26:04,121 --> 02:26:09,121
but I would say that it's you have to 
create a more extreme deficit to do that

3084
02:26:09,490 --> 02:26:13,270
and so you are activating your body self
defense system more intensely.

3085
02:26:13,360 --> 02:26:14,193
If I had to say it that way,
so the rebound is usually bigger as 

3086
02:26:16,691 --> 02:26:18,490
well,
so it's.

3087
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:19,413
It's trying to find a way of cake.
Can we get this weight off and then 

3088
02:26:22,271 --> 02:26:27,271
let's really emphasize to people that 
the diet after the Diet,

3089
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:31,210
nobody talks about this except for us in
the book.

3090
02:26:32,110 --> 02:26:36,400
Nobody talks about this like co writer 
for the book,

3091
02:26:36,430 --> 02:26:37,263
Peter Baker and I,
we spent were spent chapters talking 

3092
02:26:39,371 --> 02:26:42,340
about when you go and transition into,
okay,

3093
02:26:42,341 --> 02:26:44,680
we've lost the weight we want to lose 
were healthier.

3094
02:26:45,400 --> 02:26:46,233
You have to have the same amount of 
discipline and intensity to then 

3095
02:26:49,661 --> 02:26:53,020
maintain that loss because if you let 
up,

3096
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:53,913
if you let your foot off the gas,
now you don't necessarily have to be at 

3097
02:26:56,891 --> 02:26:57,724
the same caloric restriction level,
but if you just let yourself go on a 

3098
02:27:01,201 --> 02:27:02,110
vacation,
I'm going to eat.

3099
02:27:02,230 --> 02:27:03,340
I'm gonna,
eat what I want,

3100
02:27:04,350 --> 02:27:05,183
boom,
gained 10 pounds and everybody knows 

3101
02:27:06,701 --> 02:27:07,534
people like this,
who they go and they do this and you've 

3102
02:27:09,701 --> 02:27:10,534
just,
you've literally just undid months of 

3103
02:27:13,871 --> 02:27:14,704
hard work in one week would say if you 
could maintain that for a set amount of 

3104
02:27:18,581 --> 02:27:19,720
time,
say six months.

3105
02:27:19,810 --> 02:27:22,720
So I think that if someone can maintain 
that weight loss for six months,

3106
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:26,440
that's like sort of like the tipping 
point where they can go on.

3107
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:28,740
Got My wheel house right here,
go up.

3108
02:27:29,100 --> 02:27:32,230
So.
So that's a great point.

3109
02:27:32,231 --> 02:27:33,064
So Leptin as you,
I'm sure you've heard of people talking 

3110
02:27:35,801 --> 02:27:37,360
about Leptin,
so when you lose fat,

3111
02:27:37,390 --> 02:27:38,223
Leptin secretion goes down because fat 
cells secrete it and it's Kinda like 

3112
02:27:42,131 --> 02:27:43,660
your body's thermostat and body fat.

3113
02:27:43,690 --> 02:27:45,710
Everybody has like a set point their 
body likes to be.

3114
02:27:45,711 --> 02:27:46,544
Yet,
so if you lose body fat used to create 

3115
02:27:47,861 --> 02:27:49,510
less Leptin,
hunger goes up,

3116
02:27:49,690 --> 02:27:50,523
metabolic rate goes down,
Krellan tries to yes and girl is in 

3117
02:27:52,781 --> 02:27:54,670
opposition to Leptin,
so you,

3118
02:27:54,700 --> 02:27:56,800
you.
This is your body like a thermostat,

3119
02:27:56,801 --> 02:28:00,490
so if on a thermostat,
if you said it's 75 goes to low,

3120
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:01,840
kick the heat on bumper,
back up,

3121
02:28:02,230 --> 02:28:04,720
goes to high,
kick the cooling and go back down,

3122
02:28:04,760 --> 02:28:07,030
left and acts that way with your 
metabolic rate and your hunger.

3123
02:28:08,290 --> 02:28:11,440
When you get down to a low body fat,
Leptin is low,

3124
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:14,500
your body,
you have a drive to regain that weight.

3125
02:28:14,530 --> 02:28:16,590
You're your hungers higher,
your boss,

3126
02:28:16,620 --> 02:28:18,790
your,
your metabolic rate is lower.

3127
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:22,070
Leptin still stays low even

3128
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:22,903
years after a diet and people who have 
kept the weight off so you would think 

3129
02:28:29,361 --> 02:28:31,820
there'd still be a biological drive to 
regain the weight.

3130
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:35,480
That said,
and I'm going to go out on a limb here,

3131
02:28:35,570 --> 02:28:37,820
so any of my scientists who are 
listening on this,

3132
02:28:37,821 --> 02:28:40,220
feel free to call me out on the carpet 
if you think I'm wrong,

3133
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:42,373
but just like obese people,
obese people actually have high levels 

3134
02:28:44,781 --> 02:28:47,420
of Leptin.
They have high levels of Leptin,

3135
02:28:47,450 --> 02:28:50,420
but they become leptin resistant up to 
an insensitive,

3136
02:28:50,450 --> 02:28:52,370
right.
If you stay at a re,

3137
02:28:52,420 --> 02:28:53,253
there is evidence that if you stay at a 
reduced body weight for one or two 

3138
02:28:55,671 --> 02:28:56,504
years,
that that can become your new set point 

3139
02:28:59,301 --> 02:29:00,134
that your body defense.
I think what can happen is even if your 

3140
02:29:01,941 --> 02:29:04,490
Leptin doesn't go out or two years,
not six months,

3141
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:05,720
yeah,
it's a little bit longer,

3142
02:29:05,890 --> 02:29:07,930
a little bit longer,
but it's a good stock aneurysm.

3143
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:10,070
What's happening?
Well,

3144
02:29:10,071 --> 02:29:12,230
I think it's probably multifaceted 
because nothing,

3145
02:29:12,260 --> 02:29:15,650
your body is so redundant.
Usually nothing is ever one thing.

3146
02:29:15,710 --> 02:29:16,543
Typically your set point,
I think one of the things that happens 

3147
02:29:19,731 --> 02:29:23,270
is probably your body becomes more 
sensitive to the Leptin you have because

3148
02:29:23,271 --> 02:29:24,104
you're leaner.
Now I want to talk about performance 

3149
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:27,193
because this is a big thing with 
athletes and particularly in my field 

3150
02:29:29,991 --> 02:29:30,824
with fighters.
Many of them were reluctant to try 

3151
02:29:33,291 --> 02:29:38,291
ketogenic diet initially because of the.
The first few weeks are pretty rough and

3152
02:29:39,071 --> 02:29:40,130
it,
it really enhanced,

3153
02:29:40,250 --> 02:29:41,083
inhibits training and you get that Keto 
flu feeling and I've experienced that 

3154
02:29:44,661 --> 02:29:45,494
too,
but overall is the key to genic diet a 

3155
02:29:49,461 --> 02:29:50,294
good strategy for someone that's 
involved in some sort of a brutal 

3156
02:29:54,591 --> 02:29:58,940
athletic pursuit like football or 
wrestling.

3157
02:29:59,090 --> 02:30:03,770
It can be absolutely,
and it will be dependent upon being keto

3158
02:30:03,771 --> 02:30:08,750
adapted over time and actually training 
in a state of Ketosis.

3159
02:30:08,810 --> 02:30:11,000
So you forced those adaptations over 
time.

3160
02:30:11,001 --> 02:30:14,300
We know that the ketogenic diet is 
glycogen sparing overtime.

3161
02:30:14,330 --> 02:30:17,540
Glycolytic pathways will be decreased 
over time,

3162
02:30:17,541 --> 02:30:22,520
so that may impair a anaerobic power 
output initially,

3163
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:25,590
but I think that most people,
some people,

3164
02:30:26,090 --> 02:30:29,450
I think a good amount of people could 
adapt back to,

3165
02:30:29,451 --> 02:30:30,284
especially if they're taking things like
creatine monohydrate and taking various 

3166
02:30:32,931 --> 02:30:35,390
supplements that can kind of fill that 
gap,

3167
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:36,553
uh,
to meet the glycolytic anaerobic energy 

3168
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:39,820
demands.
You know,

3169
02:30:39,820 --> 02:30:41,110
that tighter.
Yeah.

3170
02:30:41,350 --> 02:30:42,290
Yeah.
Zack bitter,

3171
02:30:42,291 --> 02:30:43,124
who holds the American record for the 
fastest 24 hour run or 24 the fastest 

3172
02:30:48,861 --> 02:30:53,300
100 mile run.
He did it in an 11 hours and 40 minutes.

3173
02:30:53,310 --> 02:30:55,130
Insane.
He ran 100 miles.

3174
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:56,113
It's fucking just nonsense.
Now she can correspond with him on 

3175
02:30:59,181 --> 02:31:00,180
twitter one time.
Not,

3176
02:31:00,270 --> 02:31:01,790
not by the way.
Very,

3177
02:31:02,780 --> 02:31:04,730
very smart.
Jeff Bolek I think,

3178
02:31:04,731 --> 02:31:06,950
uh,
brought him to my attention and actually

3179
02:31:06,951 --> 02:31:07,784
we're looking at some of the muscle 
biopsies from various athletes that are 

3180
02:31:11,181 --> 02:31:12,230
doing similar things.
Yeah,

3181
02:31:12,231 --> 02:31:15,800
he is on a ketogenic diet essentially,
but when he does these long races,

3182
02:31:16,010 --> 02:31:18,050
he takes in a considerable amount of 
glucose.

3183
02:31:18,360 --> 02:31:19,410
Yup.
Yeah.

3184
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:20,290
He

3185
02:31:20,290 --> 02:31:23,130
uses those gels and you know,
take hundreds and hundreds,

3186
02:31:23,131 --> 02:31:23,964
probably relatively sparingly compared 
to a person that's already like very 

3187
02:31:27,541 --> 02:31:29,040
carb adapted.
So.

3188
02:31:29,041 --> 02:31:29,874
Right.
So you just,

3189
02:31:29,880 --> 02:31:31,860
you just want to,
especially a hundred mile race,

3190
02:31:31,861 --> 02:31:35,790
you titrate in smaller instead of 
drinking 50 or 100 grams of carbs,

3191
02:31:36,120 --> 02:31:36,953
20 grams of carbs every hour or two,
maybe more than enough to say if you 

3192
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:44,960
need to correct us.
Well,

3193
02:31:44,980 --> 02:31:45,813
Zach has a podcast that he also does 
with Sean Baker and he basically eats 

3194
02:31:49,651 --> 02:31:50,700
mostly meat.
I mean,

3195
02:31:50,960 --> 02:31:53,220
Zach's diet consists of mostly like rib 
eyes,

3196
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:55,980
so he's fully Quito to Andy's using 
glucose.

3197
02:31:55,981 --> 02:31:59,260
I think glucose and this may aggravate 
some of the top.

3198
02:31:59,670 --> 02:32:00,503
I think glucose is one of the most 
powerful performance enhancing 

3199
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:06,190
substances out there really on the 
record show that,

3200
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:07,073
especially in the context of that,
where your glycogen levels are being 

3201
02:32:09,991 --> 02:32:11,880
depleted over time.
Uh,

3202
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:12,953
and even from a training perspective,
very small amounts of glucose are anti 

3203
02:32:15,511 --> 02:32:16,344
catabolic,
maybe argue anabolic in the context of 

3204
02:32:19,231 --> 02:32:20,000
certain scenarios.

3205
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:20,833
So Lloyd May,
whether drinks coca cola or small 

3206
02:32:22,801 --> 02:32:25,440
amounts right after he trains.
Well,

3207
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:27,060
is there any benefit to that?
Well,

3208
02:32:27,061 --> 02:32:27,894
I mean,
you're going to get glycogen 

3209
02:32:28,231 --> 02:32:29,064
replenishment.
There's research out of a layman's lab 

3210
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:35,580
years ago that showed that actually 
sucrose replenishes glycogen,

3211
02:32:35,590 --> 02:32:36,423
the muscle faster than pure glucose,
which is interesting probably because 

3212
02:32:39,601 --> 02:32:40,434
the,
the fruit dose gets taken up by the 

3213
02:32:41,101 --> 02:32:42,660
liver.
So the glucose you do eat,

3214
02:32:42,661 --> 02:32:44,760
the liver doesn't steal,
steal any of it,

3215
02:32:44,761 --> 02:32:45,610
and it goes,
uh,

3216
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:49,440
your glucose go into muscle.
But I would say ketones to.

3217
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:53,460
So if the science is very new but 
exogenous ketones,

3218
02:32:53,480 --> 02:32:54,560
uh,
especially in the,

3219
02:32:54,940 --> 02:32:59,940
in the context of aerobic performance 
key genics or like a ketone Ester,

3220
02:33:00,900 --> 02:33:03,720
a key genics products is great.
Ketone esters,

3221
02:33:03,721 --> 02:33:05,760
most of the science behind ketone 
esters.

3222
02:33:05,790 --> 02:33:07,650
Uh,
but there are,

3223
02:33:07,740 --> 02:33:08,573
you know,
valid applications for the ketone salts 

3224
02:33:10,081 --> 02:33:12,180
that are emerging on the market too,
like eugenics.

3225
02:33:12,420 --> 02:33:13,253
Uh,
I think that the science just over the 

3226
02:33:16,950 --> 02:33:18,360
last couple of years has been 
incredible,

3227
02:33:18,380 --> 02:33:19,350
um,
emerging on that.

3228
02:33:19,351 --> 02:33:21,810
And I think it's something to watch over
time.

3229
02:33:21,811 --> 02:33:24,390
It's a new fuel source.
It's like the fourth macronutrient,

3230
02:33:24,540 --> 02:33:25,620
right?
We have carbs,

3231
02:33:25,621 --> 02:33:28,440
proteins,
fats and alcohol.

3232
02:33:28,441 --> 02:33:29,590
Yeah.
Arguably it can be.

3233
02:33:29,790 --> 02:33:30,623
So I,
I view ketones as they are a calorie 

3234
02:33:32,731 --> 02:33:35,180
containing energy source.
So they are a fourth macronutrient.

3235
02:33:35,181 --> 02:33:36,001
Now,
let me ask you this.

3236
02:33:36,001 --> 02:33:40,080
If you were doing nutritional consultant
for say someone who's a UFC champion and

3237
02:33:40,081 --> 02:33:41,240
they said,
you know,

3238
02:33:41,250 --> 02:33:44,010
I want to get on the optimal diet for 
performance.

3239
02:33:44,250 --> 02:33:48,150
You don't think that a ketogenic diet is
the optimal diet for performance,

3240
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:48,993
is that safe to say?
Or you would have to experience for a 

3241
02:33:52,420 --> 02:33:54,750
long period one,
it's going to be individual.

3242
02:33:54,870 --> 02:33:56,610
You certainly wouldn't do it in the 
midst of a camp,

3243
02:33:56,611 --> 02:33:59,230
right?
If somebody month the,

3244
02:33:59,290 --> 02:34:00,150
the,
the,

3245
02:34:00,740 --> 02:34:03,210
Oh man,
it's such a new season thing to.

3246
02:34:03,250 --> 02:34:06,990
It's such a nuanced question,
but the problem is you don't necessarily

3247
02:34:06,991 --> 02:34:09,510
get an off season the in the because if 
they call you with a fight,

3248
02:34:09,880 --> 02:34:13,110
not look nicely upon if you turn it 
down.

3249
02:34:13,350 --> 02:34:14,970
So,
um,

3250
02:34:16,530 --> 02:34:18,010
I think on the research I've

3251
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:18,843
seen,
I think you're hard pressed to convince 

3252
02:34:21,131 --> 02:34:26,131
me that a ketogenic diet is worse than a
non ketogenic diet on endurance.

3253
02:34:26,830 --> 02:34:27,663
I think that's pretty clear and there 
may actually be some benefits depending 

3254
02:34:31,421 --> 02:34:33,580
on the individual.
Um,

3255
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:38,670
as far as repeated sprints or things 
where you need that anaerobic system,

3256
02:34:39,910 --> 02:34:41,760
I am not ready to say that acute jake 
died.

3257
02:34:41,761 --> 02:34:46,480
It's going to be as good.
I think that a non ketogenic diet offers

3258
02:34:46,481 --> 02:34:47,314
you now this is where ketone supplements
may be actually the best thing possible 

3259
02:34:51,370 --> 02:34:52,203
because you could be using glucose so 
you're getting that fuel source and 

3260
02:34:56,321 --> 02:34:59,020
taking a ketone supplement where you're 
getting that fuel as well.

3261
02:34:59,021 --> 02:35:02,620
Not on a ketogenic diet,
but taking ketone supplements that will.

3262
02:35:02,860 --> 02:35:05,350
Again,
I don't know.

3263
02:35:05,620 --> 02:35:06,453
I think honestly I want to see more 
research so I want to see more reduced 

3264
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:09,890
fat.

3265
02:35:09,890 --> 02:35:12,710
It's carbohydrates,
maybe amino acids,

3266
02:35:12,740 --> 02:35:13,970
Korea 10.
I mean,

3267
02:35:14,030 --> 02:35:14,863
you know,
just basically trying to leverage all 

3268
02:35:17,810 --> 02:35:21,410
the various substrates that your body 
can use specially under,

3269
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:23,760
if we're talking about anaerobic 
Ketogenic,

3270
02:35:24,360 --> 02:35:28,790
something you want to have a suite of 
different fuel sources,

3271
02:35:28,791 --> 02:35:29,624
you know,
and not rely you like metal bought the 

3272
02:35:31,041 --> 02:35:34,190
term metabolic flexibility,
which is kind of used use quite often.

3273
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:35,173
Uh,
but I think if you train and get your 

3274
02:35:36,411 --> 02:35:41,090
body fat and Keto adapted,
that provides benefits for recovery.

3275
02:35:41,091 --> 02:35:44,060
It provides benefits if you're getting.
What are the benefits for recovery,

3276
02:35:44,240 --> 02:35:45,710
uh,
enhanced,

3277
02:35:45,770 --> 02:35:46,520
uh,
you know,

3278
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:49,280
lower inflammation,
lower chronic inflammation over time,

3279
02:35:49,310 --> 02:35:50,143
you know,
chronic inflammation can contribute to 

3280
02:35:51,741 --> 02:35:53,900
insulin resistance,
poor Glycan,

3281
02:35:54,310 --> 02:35:59,310
a neuro inflammation if you're getting 
concussions or even subconcussive events

3282
02:35:59,661 --> 02:36:02,300
over time can actually cause a lot of 
damage.

3283
02:36:02,301 --> 02:36:03,134
And I think the mechanism that decreases
inflammation with the kidogenic diet as 

3284
02:36:06,561 --> 02:36:07,394
opposed to a non a number of mechanisms,
I mean just simply lowering insulin 

3285
02:36:11,241 --> 02:36:14,360
spikes in glucose.
But the NLRP three inflammasome,

3286
02:36:14,390 --> 02:36:16,910
uh,
is something that we looked at.

3287
02:36:16,911 --> 02:36:17,744
There was a study where actually we used
the ketone ester and it's published in 

3288
02:36:20,481 --> 02:36:22,700
the journal Nature Medicine showing 
that,

3289
02:36:22,830 --> 02:36:24,980
uh,
in response to Lps,

3290
02:36:24,981 --> 02:36:27,470
which is kind of like a,
a inflammatory,

3291
02:36:27,500 --> 02:36:28,333
very powerful inflammatory stimulant 
that it reduces that and suppresses 

3292
02:36:31,370 --> 02:36:36,260
inflammatory pathways for a particular 
pathway compared to,

3293
02:36:36,920 --> 02:36:39,740
uh,
compared to,

3294
02:36:39,980 --> 02:36:40,813
uh,
you mean

3295
02:36:41,510 --> 02:36:44,210
so well with your study,
you're always comparing to things.

3296
02:36:44,370 --> 02:36:45,350
So,
so what will you,

3297
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:47,480
what was the control group?
A,

3298
02:36:48,010 --> 02:36:52,360
the control group for the inflammation 
or it was just compared to know,

3299
02:36:52,420 --> 02:36:54,570
like control thing.
So it's just like,

3300
02:36:54,710 --> 02:36:55,840
did you give us any CBO?
Okay.

3301
02:36:55,900 --> 02:36:56,733
Yeah.
Yep.

3302
02:36:56,770 --> 02:37:00,670
Uh,
so in the context of being in a state of

3303
02:37:00,671 --> 02:37:04,300
Ketosis,
it reduces an inflammatory pathway.

3304
02:37:04,301 --> 02:37:06,460
Think of it as a hub and when that's 
activated,

3305
02:37:06,910 --> 02:37:07,743
a,
you have a host of inflammatory 

3306
02:37:08,951 --> 02:37:13,951
cytokines that flow throughout your body
and your brain and causes persistent low

3307
02:37:13,991 --> 02:37:18,680
grade a neuro inflammation,
inflammation in the body that can impede

3308
02:37:19,220 --> 02:37:20,053
recovery processes over time.
And I think that really contributes to 

3309
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:26,330
brain health too.
So I might be getting a little far ahead

3310
02:37:26,331 --> 02:37:28,850
of myself because that is its animal 
work,

3311
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:29,893
but it's convincing animal work,
looking at a particular pathway that's 

3312
02:37:32,661 --> 02:37:36,740
pretty well defined before you get to 
this is their one zero variation between

3313
02:37:36,770 --> 02:37:41,770
a low carb versus ketosis in elevation 
of ketone levels in your blood.

3314
02:37:42,950 --> 02:37:44,690
Right.
But I mean in terms of a,

3315
02:37:45,170 --> 02:37:46,003
is there a benefit to the ketogenic to 
being in a state of Ketosis with this 

3316
02:37:50,451 --> 02:37:53,520
reduction of inflammation versus low 
carb a?

3317
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:58,040
I believe there is just by elevating the
metabolite,

3318
02:37:58,100 --> 02:37:58,933
a Beta hydroxy butyrate,
but I do think even low carb has some 

3319
02:38:03,440 --> 02:38:06,500
antiinflammatory effects,
but optimal would be ketosis.

3320
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:07,860
Uh,
I,

3321
02:38:08,300 --> 02:38:09,133
like I said,
I don't think it's going to be optimal 

3322
02:38:10,821 --> 02:38:11,654
for everybody,
but I know there's going to be benefits 

3323
02:38:13,670 --> 02:38:18,670
to maintaining low to moderate levels of
ketones for neurological health and also

3324
02:38:19,220 --> 02:38:23,130
for,
for recovery and maybe performance lane.

3325
02:38:23,150 --> 02:38:26,060
You were wincing at the mention of 
inflammation

3326
02:38:26,680 --> 02:38:27,513
more so that.
So we mentioned recovery from exercise 

3327
02:38:29,501 --> 02:38:30,610
and inflammation and calories

3328
02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:34,360
deficit is a very powerful anti and anti
inflammatory.

3329
02:38:34,390 --> 02:38:36,120
So I mean Lane Lane address.

3330
02:38:36,380 --> 02:38:37,213
Thank you for the context.
My fellow scientists known Zilla 

3331
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:42,050
appreciate that.
So one thing I want to,

3332
02:38:42,210 --> 02:38:43,043
because because people get,
it's easy to get into black and white 

3333
02:38:44,541 --> 02:38:46,340
thinking.
We hear inflammation and we think,

3334
02:38:46,341 --> 02:38:46,591
oh,
that,

3335
02:38:46,591 --> 02:38:47,540
that's bad,
that's bad.

3336
02:38:48,530 --> 02:38:51,650
So there's some studies that tell us 
quite a bit about inflammation.

3337
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:54,740
Your body actually has an optimal level 
of inflammation,

3338
02:38:55,070 --> 02:38:55,903
too.
Little inflammation is actually bad as 

3339
02:38:57,261 --> 02:38:59,990
well.
So if you first chronic.

3340
02:38:59,991 --> 02:39:01,130
I was talking about chronic.
Yes.

3341
02:39:01,150 --> 02:39:02,570
This is a lot of thing.
A lot of scientists,

3342
02:39:02,571 --> 02:39:03,404
ms dot two is an acute.
We can tell about tor and cancer and 

3343
02:39:05,901 --> 02:39:06,734
people,
acute versus chronic and how scientists 

3344
02:39:07,941 --> 02:39:11,090
even messed this stuff up,
but you.

3345
02:39:11,220 --> 02:39:12,053
So if you,
if you look at studies of recovery from 

3346
02:39:13,401 --> 02:39:16,670
exercise and muscle growth,
I'm focusing on this,

3347
02:39:16,730 --> 02:39:17,900
but I'll,
I'll bring it back around.

3348
02:39:19,310 --> 02:39:24,310
If you give Ibuprofen to healthy people 
who have normal levels of inflammation,

3349
02:39:25,240 --> 02:39:27,380
uh,
Ibuprofen inhibits muscle growth.

3350
02:39:28,490 --> 02:39:32,030
If you give it to elderly people with 
high levels of inflammation,

3351
02:39:32,270 --> 02:39:37,270
they grow more muscle.
So this means that the body for recovery

3352
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:40,790
has an optimal level of inflammation at 
likes to be in.

3353
02:39:40,791 --> 02:39:43,910
There is a a,
a kind of a curve here.

3354
02:39:44,270 --> 02:39:47,770
It's a cox two inhibitor and Beta 
hydroxybutyrate is also a costume,

3355
02:39:47,850 --> 02:39:48,683
right,
and so the part of growing muscle and 

3356
02:39:51,681 --> 02:39:52,514
recovery is actually inflammation.
Macrophages and all these sorts of 

3357
02:39:56,361 --> 02:39:59,630
things are involved in that process.
Now if it gets run away,

3358
02:39:59,631 --> 02:40:02,030
if it's too much,
it's not a good thing,

3359
02:40:02,031 --> 02:40:03,950
but if it's too little,
it's also not a good thing.

3360
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:04,993
Andy Galpin did a great job on your show
of talking about a recovery versus 

3361
02:40:09,081 --> 02:40:10,520
adaptation,
right?

3362
02:40:10,610 --> 02:40:11,960
Yeah.
So one of the things he said,

3363
02:40:11,961 --> 02:40:13,040
if you do ice baths,
you,

3364
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:16,140
these sorts of things,
your in the short term,

3365
02:40:16,141 --> 02:40:16,974
allowing yourself to recover faster,
but you're also limiting how much 

3366
02:40:19,621 --> 02:40:21,270
adaptation you're going to incur.

3367
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:24,600
And I loved that because it was people 
miss this.

3368
02:40:24,630 --> 02:40:26,000
They say,
you know,

3369
02:40:26,010 --> 02:40:27,990
if you're,
if you're somebody in the off season,

3370
02:40:28,020 --> 02:40:31,200
if you're trying to grow,
get more lean body mass or trying to get

3371
02:40:31,201 --> 02:40:34,920
better at something,
it's probably good to let your body like

3372
02:40:35,850 --> 02:40:36,683
for lack of better term,
have some inflammation and not in the 

3373
02:40:39,031 --> 02:40:41,610
longterm but in response to that 
training session.

3374
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:43,950
But then if you're in a camp,
again,

3375
02:40:43,951 --> 02:40:44,784
this is where it's context dependent or 
like I'm a power lifter getting ready 

3376
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:50,010
for a meet and I'm supposed to be 
squatting four times a week.

3377
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:50,873
I've done that before and I'm so sore 
that I can't squat my fourth session 

3378
02:40:54,860 --> 02:40:55,693
than an ice bath or something.
I'm not worried about growing muscle in 

3379
02:40:57,481 --> 02:40:58,314
that time.
I'm worried about getting recovered 

3380
02:41:00,361 --> 02:41:01,194
enough that I can go do my next training
session because that is a lot more 

3381
02:41:03,301 --> 02:41:05,010
important for my competition coming up.

3382
02:41:05,460 --> 02:41:07,260
Then having that little bit of extra 
muscle.

3383
02:41:07,290 --> 02:41:09,350
So in camp,
probably a good idea.

3384
02:41:09,390 --> 02:41:11,820
Postseason not a good idea.
Yeah,

3385
02:41:11,821 --> 02:41:14,130
I mean unless again,
it's all contextual dependent,

3386
02:41:14,131 --> 02:41:14,964
right?
Like if you start getting so sore that 

3387
02:41:16,471 --> 02:41:20,040
you can only train like twice a week,
then maybe a certain level,

3388
02:41:20,370 --> 02:41:21,203
but that points back to that there's an 
optimal range of inflammation that your 

3389
02:41:25,441 --> 02:41:28,470
body probably should be in that's 
optimal for health as well.

3390
02:41:28,710 --> 02:41:31,270
Now I don't think like doing a ketogenic
diet for somebody,

3391
02:41:31,300 --> 02:41:33,180
it's going to take them out of that 
necessarily,

3392
02:41:33,450 --> 02:41:34,283
but I always want to give context 
because people hear these things and 

3393
02:41:37,111 --> 02:41:39,990
they always think it's a positive.
Like in terms of recovery,

3394
02:41:40,170 --> 02:41:41,003
I believe that it can enhance the 
adaptive process associated with 

3395
02:41:44,071 --> 02:41:44,904
recovery.
And I also believe that being in a 

3396
02:41:46,561 --> 02:41:49,980
ketogenic state will enhance your 
readiness,

3397
02:41:50,490 --> 02:41:55,490
your resilience and your recovery.
So from a military perspective too,

3398
02:41:55,600 --> 02:41:57,380
I believe that,
uh,

3399
02:41:57,450 --> 02:41:58,283
and,
and that needs to be validated and 

3400
02:41:59,940 --> 02:42:00,940
study,
but it's something that,

3401
02:42:01,030 --> 02:42:02,210
that we study.
When you,

3402
02:42:02,220 --> 02:42:05,100
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but when you advise us to the military,

3403
02:42:05,340 --> 02:42:06,173
do they,
do you put them on a specific meal plan 

3404
02:42:07,921 --> 02:42:08,910
to,
or do they have,

3405
02:42:08,911 --> 02:42:10,020
it's more like,
you know,

3406
02:42:10,021 --> 02:42:13,770
how to do that grants whereas is being 
studied at a very fundamental,

3407
02:42:13,771 --> 02:42:14,604
very controlled level from cells to 
animal models to human clinical trials 

3408
02:42:19,620 --> 02:42:20,453
going on and where the data is being 
collected now and some of it is taken 

3409
02:42:23,731 --> 02:42:27,210
empirically and anecdotally from the 
field or just from various,

3410
02:42:27,250 --> 02:42:28,830
uh,
exclusive channels.

3411
02:42:28,831 --> 02:42:30,390
I guess I would say,
uh,

3412
02:42:30,480 --> 02:42:32,980
so that I am coming at it as a biased 
and I'm,

3413
02:42:32,981 --> 02:42:34,950
I'm kind of speaking ahead of the 
science,

3414
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:36,473
but I do think that science already 
exist showing that you have a greater 

3415
02:42:42,121 --> 02:42:42,954
adaptive effect just by virtue of 
lowering inflammation over time in 

3416
02:42:46,771 --> 02:42:47,880
athletes especially.

3417
02:42:48,090 --> 02:42:50,880
This probably pertains more to endurance
athletes,

3418
02:42:51,060 --> 02:42:53,790
so it really needs to be studied in 
resistance trend,

3419
02:42:53,791 --> 02:42:55,170
mma fighters and things like that.

3420
02:42:55,820 --> 02:42:58,820
So there was a recent study that I can't
remember the researchers,

3421
02:42:58,821 --> 02:42:59,900
Dave,
I'll send it to you.

3422
02:43:00,170 --> 02:43:01,003
I had a lot of criticisms of it,
but they did show that ketogenic versus 

3423
02:43:04,581 --> 02:43:09,020
non ketogenic diet and people who were 
lifting weights trying to get bigger,

3424
02:43:09,530 --> 02:43:10,363
that there was actually slightly less 
mass using the ketogenic diet where you 

3425
02:43:13,901 --> 02:43:15,640
think that would be because of the less 
protein?

3426
02:43:16,330 --> 02:43:17,530
No,
they equated protein.

3427
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:19,600
I'm pretty sure I want to say they 
equate it.

3428
02:43:19,601 --> 02:43:21,940
Protein now.
I don't know for sure.

3429
02:43:22,120 --> 02:43:24,220
So I don't want to say authoritative 
today,

3430
02:43:24,270 --> 02:43:26,330
but I believe to stay in Ketosis,
you're going to.

3431
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:30,610
How did they adjust for calories?
I believe they did.

3432
02:43:30,760 --> 02:43:33,550
So again,
I could be wrong and so I'll go back and

3433
02:43:33,551 --> 02:43:35,710
look and I'll,
I'll send it to you if you want it.

3434
02:43:35,990 --> 02:43:38,410
Um,
but it is possible like again,

3435
02:43:38,470 --> 02:43:40,630
for every given me there's a Gotcha in 
certain things.

3436
02:43:40,630 --> 02:43:41,463
Right?
So like these things that activate 

3437
02:43:43,571 --> 02:43:44,740
different pathways.
Well,

3438
02:43:45,220 --> 02:43:46,053
part of what ketones may signal as a 
deficit because usually you don't have 

3439
02:43:48,791 --> 02:43:50,260
them in a surplus,
right?

3440
02:43:50,710 --> 02:43:52,240
So,
you know,

3441
02:43:52,630 --> 02:43:55,360
we don't know if you can like for 
example,

3442
02:43:55,361 --> 02:43:56,920
like a tough dog,
right?

3443
02:43:56,921 --> 02:43:59,080
Like if we're talking about performance 
and muscle,

3444
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:01,370
everybody here is a tough gig and that's
a very,

3445
02:44:01,450 --> 02:44:02,283
by the way,
that's such a weird way to pronounce 

3446
02:44:02,951 --> 02:44:07,630
that because it's auto and phagocytosis 
so it shouldn't be out of age.

3447
02:44:07,660 --> 02:44:10,960
But anyway,
it's a very rapidly emerging science.

3448
02:44:10,961 --> 02:44:14,590
And Naomi Whittell wrote a book about 
this and it just,

3449
02:44:14,591 --> 02:44:17,380
it's like a New York Times bestseller 
and that really covers a science.

3450
02:44:17,381 --> 02:44:19,540
So licensed since two or three years.
Yeah.

3451
02:44:19,541 --> 02:44:22,480
License almost remodeling and 
degradation of proteins,

3452
02:44:22,481 --> 02:44:23,790
but very high.
What,

3453
02:44:23,820 --> 02:44:26,590
what gets me is like people who are big 
on intermittent fasting,

3454
02:44:27,090 --> 02:44:27,850
they'll say,
oh,

3455
02:44:27,850 --> 02:44:29,880
increases a tough Gig,
but you also,

3456
02:44:29,990 --> 02:44:30,823
they're also saying you can grow all 
this muscle and it's going to be best 

3457
02:44:32,891 --> 02:44:33,724
for building muscle,
but that's not true because autophagy 

3458
02:44:36,070 --> 02:44:38,050
autophagy is part of protein 
degradation.

3459
02:44:38,350 --> 02:44:43,350
So if you're increasing that system,
by definition that's less muscle.

3460
02:44:43,420 --> 02:44:45,460
So you're,
there's always a give me an a Gotcha.

3461
02:44:45,461 --> 02:44:47,230
For one benefit,
there might be a drawback.

3462
02:44:47,231 --> 02:44:49,360
Now,
depending on your individual situation,

3463
02:44:49,690 --> 02:44:51,220
maybe it makes more sense.
Right?

3464
02:44:51,430 --> 02:44:52,263
Like having the most muscle mass 
possible may not be the best thing for 

3465
02:44:56,081 --> 02:44:58,540
health.
Now we know that having,

3466
02:44:58,630 --> 02:45:00,760
having more muscle mass than normal is 
good for health,

3467
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:01,953
but maybe having like absolute peak 
muscle mass may not be the best thing 

3468
02:45:04,361 --> 02:45:05,194
for help,
you know.

3469
02:45:05,200 --> 02:45:06,033
So it's like,
that's why I was trying to say earlier 

3470
02:45:08,560 --> 02:45:12,220
there's never going to be one diet that 
just fixes all of our problems.

3471
02:45:12,370 --> 02:45:15,640
It depends on the individual and what 
they're trying to get out of it.

3472
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:17,080
Just like,
um,

3473
02:45:17,380 --> 02:45:20,740
if I went to a,
and again I'm not a have much.

3474
02:45:20,950 --> 02:45:23,350
I watched MMA for years.
Loved your commentary.

3475
02:45:23,350 --> 02:45:25,480
That's where I learned a lot of stuff 
about eminent mma,

3476
02:45:25,780 --> 02:45:28,240
but if I went to a Brazilian Jujitsu 
instructor and I said,

3477
02:45:28,450 --> 02:45:29,283
what's the best technique?
He's got to look at me like I'm an 

3478
02:45:31,451 --> 02:45:32,740
idiot,
right?

3479
02:45:32,950 --> 02:45:35,270
Because he's not going to say,
yeah,

3480
02:45:35,290 --> 02:45:36,123
a arm bar every time.
That's the best technique for Jujitsu 

3481
02:45:38,890 --> 02:45:40,270
and that's when people say what's the 
best diet?

3482
02:45:40,271 --> 02:45:41,690
It's the same thing,
right?

3483
02:45:41,710 --> 02:45:43,780
It's completely contextual.
Dependent,

3484
02:45:44,110 --> 02:45:44,943
right?
Depends on you and in the case of 

3485
02:45:46,451 --> 02:45:48,010
inmate,
depends on your opponent as well.

3486
02:45:48,100 --> 02:45:51,250
What your goals are,
your strategies and your tactics.

3487
02:45:51,280 --> 02:45:52,113
I think what we were trying to really 
emphasize is that individuality 

3488
02:45:55,480 --> 02:45:58,030
dependent,
but also I really want to emphasize that

3489
02:45:58,031 --> 02:46:00,010
this show was calories matter.
You know,

3490
02:46:00,130 --> 02:46:03,340
calories matter,
even in even if you're eating low carb,

3491
02:46:03,850 --> 02:46:08,850
you can't just eat as much as you want 
and Herbie is a very viable option

3492
02:46:10,940 --> 02:46:15,940
to induce and sustain a calorie deficit 
that can contribute to body composition.

3493
02:46:17,060 --> 02:46:18,910
But even like you brought up a floyd 
mayweather,

3494
02:46:18,940 --> 02:46:19,773
whether earlier,
which I thought was great because you 

3495
02:46:20,781 --> 02:46:23,720
said he drinks a coke after trading.
Well,

3496
02:46:23,750 --> 02:46:26,000
it's hard to argue with his results.
But then again,

3497
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:27,073
sometimes elite athletes can get away 
with a lot of really dumb shit because 

3498
02:46:31,041 --> 02:46:31,874
they're so genetically superior that 
they were going to do well no matter 

3499
02:46:34,281 --> 02:46:35,114
what.
Did Michael Jordan eat a big Mac before 

3500
02:46:36,351 --> 02:46:37,670
every game?
No,

3501
02:46:37,730 --> 02:46:40,760
not true steak and baked potato,
steak and baked potato.

3502
02:46:41,090 --> 02:46:41,923
Whereas the big MACs Myth,
myth come from fucking by Mcdonald's 

3503
02:46:44,610 --> 02:46:49,610
model steak and baked potatoes.
Sounds like my wife can eat two or three

3504
02:46:50,031 --> 02:46:50,864
big MACs and a sitting and wash it down 
with a full sugar coke and still gain 

3505
02:46:54,051 --> 02:46:56,240
nothing.
I cringe,

3506
02:46:56,241 --> 02:46:58,250
but she.
Some people can do that.

3507
02:46:58,430 --> 02:46:59,690
Some people can do this,
sure.

3508
02:47:00,510 --> 02:47:01,450
But this.
So it's.

3509
02:47:01,490 --> 02:47:02,323
It's.
Did he become this great because he ate 

3510
02:47:04,401 --> 02:47:07,760
this way or can he eat this way because 
he's this great athlete.

3511
02:47:07,830 --> 02:47:09,770
I probably the latter,
right?

3512
02:47:10,220 --> 02:47:11,053
So we wouldn't recommend like somebody 
like if somebody is sitting at home and 

3513
02:47:14,001 --> 02:47:15,680
they want to become the greatest boxer 
ever,

3514
02:47:15,890 --> 02:47:16,723
don't go pro ball.
Public drinking coke isn't the first 

3515
02:47:18,921 --> 02:47:19,790
step.
Right?

3516
02:47:20,150 --> 02:47:20,983
But this is what we do with nutrition 
because we pick out people that we 

3517
02:47:23,391 --> 02:47:24,750
follow and we go,
Oh I,

3518
02:47:24,830 --> 02:47:28,400
I'm just gonna do that.
And it's so individualized.

3519
02:47:28,410 --> 02:47:32,120
The sidelines and marathons,
like they'll hand off coax to people.

3520
02:47:33,350 --> 02:47:34,183
I've seen it because people just want it
for fuel and people just wanting it for 

3521
02:47:37,401 --> 02:47:38,234
fuel tasted it is not a bad idea when 
you're doing something that's as 

3522
02:47:40,911 --> 02:47:43,010
grueling as American.
I don't want to say it's a bad idea.

3523
02:47:43,011 --> 02:47:43,370
I don't.

3524
02:47:43,370 --> 02:47:45,020
Yeah.
I'm not against it either.

3525
02:47:45,021 --> 02:47:46,760
If you're a carpenter now it makes 
sense.

3526
02:47:47,270 --> 02:47:48,260
Dense,
right?

3527
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:49,513
Yeah.
But you want calorie dense stuff when 

3528
02:47:50,460 --> 02:47:52,820
you're absolutely a bad thing.
Again,

3529
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:56,990
context is so important because we don't
ever drink a coke.

3530
02:47:56,991 --> 02:47:58,820
Well,
if you were starving to death,

3531
02:47:58,821 --> 02:48:00,620
I promise you you drink a coke,
you know,

3532
02:48:00,621 --> 02:48:02,080
so it's,
it's.

3533
02:48:02,230 --> 02:48:03,063
And if you need quick energy,
it's probably not the worst thing that 

3534
02:48:05,481 --> 02:48:08,570
floyd mayweather could possibly do.
Posts but not optimal.

3535
02:48:08,820 --> 02:48:10,970
Yeah.
A lot of people eat those honey waffles,

3536
02:48:10,971 --> 02:48:13,070
you know,
like when they're doing hikes and stuff.

3537
02:48:13,280 --> 02:48:14,720
But again,
at the end of the day,

3538
02:48:14,900 --> 02:48:15,740
if,
if he,

3539
02:48:15,741 --> 02:48:18,050
if his car was hydrated and take it,
I don't know what it is,

3540
02:48:18,051 --> 02:48:18,884
but if he's eating five,
600 grams of carbohydrate a day isn't 

3541
02:48:21,710 --> 02:48:22,543
really hurting him to have 40 grams of 
sugar from a coke if he's like 

3542
02:48:25,510 --> 02:48:27,350
maintaining his bodyweight,
performing optimally.

3543
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:31,190
When you think about the kind of 
grueling workouts that guy puts his,

3544
02:48:31,690 --> 02:48:34,430
maybe that's the only way he can maybe.
I don't know.

3545
02:48:34,431 --> 02:48:35,280
Again,
I'm,

3546
02:48:35,480 --> 02:48:36,313
I am theorizing.
Maybe that's the only way he can get 

3547
02:48:38,931 --> 02:48:39,764
enough food in is to eat really energy 
dense sources of food to maintain his 

3548
02:48:43,740 --> 02:48:45,350
bodyweight.
And if you started saying,

3549
02:48:45,351 --> 02:48:48,470
well we need you to eat chicken breast 
and Broccoli and you know,

3550
02:48:48,471 --> 02:48:50,960
this organic rice and all this kind of.
He,

3551
02:48:51,050 --> 02:48:51,883
he might start dropping weight like a 
stone and his performance go in the 

3552
02:48:53,931 --> 02:48:57,590
tank.
So this is why context is so important.

3553
02:48:57,650 --> 02:49:01,190
And again,
like when we talk about people think,

3554
02:49:01,880 --> 02:49:02,713
how many times have you seen two guys in
the octagon and just looked at their 

3555
02:49:05,451 --> 02:49:06,284
bodies and gun,
this one going to smash this other guy 

3556
02:49:08,281 --> 02:49:09,114
like just in the primal part of your 
brain because he was built like a tank 

3557
02:49:13,140 --> 02:49:13,973
and then the other guy who looks like 
nothing just goes out and completely 

3558
02:49:15,361 --> 02:49:15,800
obliterate.

3559
02:49:15,800 --> 02:49:16,700
It,
happens all the time,

3560
02:49:16,701 --> 02:49:17,940
all the time,
all the time.

3561
02:49:18,120 --> 02:49:22,110
Right?
So it's completely context dependent.

3562
02:49:22,120 --> 02:49:22,953
The biggest thing is to make sure that 
you don't run out of fuel during these 

3563
02:49:25,651 --> 02:49:26,670
things,
right?

3564
02:49:27,030 --> 02:49:29,970
Or whatever.
And whatever your sport is.

3565
02:49:29,971 --> 02:49:30,780
I mean,
again,

3566
02:49:30,780 --> 02:49:34,260
I'm known as a carb guy and I had this 
powerlifter one time telling me,

3567
02:49:34,860 --> 02:49:36,750
he's like,
don't you think you should carb load the

3568
02:49:36,751 --> 02:49:38,100
night before?
And I was like,

3569
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:39,473
dude,
you're doing nine reps like you're 

3570
02:49:40,770 --> 02:49:42,270
doing.
So you get three attempts on each lift,

3571
02:49:42,300 --> 02:49:43,440
squat,
bench press and deadlift.

3572
02:49:44,100 --> 02:49:46,470
You're not depleting glycogen Harb 
Limited.

3573
02:49:47,390 --> 02:49:48,480
He's like,
what?

3574
02:49:48,510 --> 02:49:51,840
Really amazed me.
Even like you can fast for a week,

3575
02:49:51,870 --> 02:49:53,010
which I did,
and deadly.

3576
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:58,040
And it's not a significant a inhibitor 
of your.

3577
02:49:59,160 --> 02:49:59,993
Of your performance running would be 
hills or something like that or doing 

3578
02:50:04,880 --> 02:50:06,750
rowing prolonged,
you know,

3579
02:50:06,790 --> 02:50:08,060
resistance training,
two or three,

3580
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:10,800
three hours,
then it's probably not optimal to go and

3581
02:50:10,930 --> 02:50:13,350
fasted to a strength,
an athletic event,

3582
02:50:13,380 --> 02:50:14,640
but you know,
it's,

3583
02:50:14,641 --> 02:50:17,160
it's,
you have to pick the context,

3584
02:50:17,161 --> 02:50:17,994
the individual and honestly people 
probably aren't gonna want to hear this 

3585
02:50:20,581 --> 02:50:21,414
from a scientist,
but we don't know enough about this 

3586
02:50:22,591 --> 02:50:26,610
stuff yet to really say for each 
individual person what's best for them.

3587
02:50:26,610 --> 02:50:28,950
And that's why we kinda got to go by 
feel.

3588
02:50:28,951 --> 02:50:29,784
We know you don't have to go drinking 
gatorade throughout your one hour 

3589
02:50:31,981 --> 02:50:33,840
workout in the gym.
Typically,

3590
02:50:33,870 --> 02:50:34,703
you know,
I'm,

3591
02:50:34,760 --> 02:50:36,260
I'm drinking ketones,
but it's,

3592
02:50:36,330 --> 02:50:37,163
you don't,
it's not going to offer you any 

3593
02:50:38,311 --> 02:50:40,960
advantage.
It's not.

3594
02:50:41,010 --> 02:50:44,730
And I did that for many years actually,
and I think guys still do it now.

3595
02:50:44,790 --> 02:50:45,623
Of course when we see it all the time,
I got to make your shake in the gym and 

3596
02:50:48,391 --> 02:50:49,820
drink a interim work.
One thing that,

3597
02:50:49,830 --> 02:50:50,663
one of the things that drove me nuts was
I kinda gotten a little back and forth 

3598
02:50:53,671 --> 02:50:58,380
with Tim noakes on twitter and he kind 
of made it out to seem that,

3599
02:50:58,920 --> 02:50:59,753
you know,
people were just missing some of his 

3600
02:51:01,441 --> 02:51:05,250
research because people in academia or 
that peer review is broken.

3601
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:06,810
Who's a tim noakes.
Oh,

3602
02:51:06,811 --> 02:51:08,490
sorry.
He's a big proponent.

3603
02:51:08,490 --> 02:51:10,380
He's a professor in South Africa,
I want to say,

3604
02:51:10,960 --> 02:51:14,730
and very knowledgeable and opinionated,
but very knowledgeable.

3605
02:51:14,731 --> 02:51:15,930
He said to me,
he's like,

3606
02:51:15,931 --> 02:51:16,764
well,
that's because you've never challenged 

3607
02:51:17,401 --> 02:51:20,670
convention because I was,
I was and and dog knows.

3608
02:51:20,671 --> 02:51:21,504
I have challenged every convention in 
the fitness industry that there ever 

3609
02:51:24,151 --> 02:51:25,860
was,
but it's just,

3610
02:51:26,220 --> 02:51:26,760
you know,
when,

3611
02:51:26,760 --> 02:51:29,320
when people asked me,
he's vocal about it.

3612
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:30,360
Yeah.
Assertive,

3613
02:51:30,361 --> 02:51:31,770
but also open minded.
Yeah.

3614
02:51:31,771 --> 02:51:36,640
I'm very open minded.
I just don't like if you can't show me a

3615
02:51:36,710 --> 02:51:38,580
hard evidence,
you know,

3616
02:51:38,850 --> 02:51:42,930
like there was a great quote from Thomas
Soul that I saw the other day.

3617
02:51:43,290 --> 02:51:44,123
It said you could ask these in science 
and go a long way in terms of sorting 

3618
02:51:47,551 --> 02:51:51,690
out bullshit compared to what,
uh,

3619
02:51:51,810 --> 02:51:54,230
where's your heart evidence,
you know,

3620
02:51:54,330 --> 02:51:56,250
and what is the cost,
right?

3621
02:51:56,670 --> 02:51:57,930
So it's,
well,

3622
02:51:57,931 --> 02:52:02,931
low carb is better compared to what and 
what's the cost on performance or any of

3623
02:52:03,991 --> 02:52:06,140
these other things.
And then where's

3624
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:07,630
your heart evidence?
Right?

3625
02:52:07,631 --> 02:52:09,610
So this is why,
like I said,

3626
02:52:09,611 --> 02:52:12,760
science over time,
yes,

3627
02:52:12,761 --> 02:52:13,594
you can have industry influences.
You can have muddled data and some 

3628
02:52:16,841 --> 02:52:18,460
scientists fake data.
We've,

3629
02:52:18,580 --> 02:52:22,270
we've both come across this scientist 
who have fake data are frustrating.

3630
02:52:22,271 --> 02:52:22,990
Is that,
oh,

3631
02:52:22,990 --> 02:52:25,240
it makes me so incensed.
In fact,

3632
02:52:25,241 --> 02:52:27,010
I,
I won't say anybody by name,

3633
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:28,113
but I used to be in business with 
somebody who I found out that I had no 

3634
02:52:31,841 --> 02:52:32,674
hard evidence,
but I had a lot of circumstantial 

3635
02:52:34,901 --> 02:52:39,310
evidence that they were faking data and 
it's even happens in cancer research.

3636
02:52:39,340 --> 02:52:44,200
It's a huge role even in cancer.
And I took this person out to dinner and

3637
02:52:44,201 --> 02:52:45,490
I told them was,
I was like,

3638
02:52:45,491 --> 02:52:47,440
we're done.
Like this thing we're doing is done.

3639
02:52:47,840 --> 02:52:50,710
And,
and thank goodness I did because it came

3640
02:52:50,711 --> 02:52:51,544
out later,
people started replicating trying to 

3641
02:52:52,541 --> 02:52:53,374
replicate this data and nobody can 
replicate this data and and they still 

3642
02:52:57,461 --> 02:53:00,930
had a pretty big following even now,
but you know,

3643
02:53:00,940 --> 02:53:02,140
it's,
it's one of those things,

3644
02:53:02,160 --> 02:53:02,993
it makes me so mad because then people 
would get so frustrated because they 

3645
02:53:06,131 --> 02:53:08,950
feel like if they feel like scientists 
or just an industry's pocket,

3646
02:53:09,430 --> 02:53:10,660
why are they going to believe anything?

3647
02:53:10,660 --> 02:53:12,070
Any of us say,
you know,

3648
02:53:12,071 --> 02:53:14,410
it's so frustrating and that's why 
motivation,

3649
02:53:15,190 --> 02:53:16,300
money,
power,

3650
02:53:16,900 --> 02:53:18,130
ego.
If a labs,

3651
02:53:18,160 --> 02:53:18,993
it's a company's funding you for a 
particular supplement and you come out 

3652
02:53:22,151 --> 02:53:22,984
with consistently with negative data,
what's the incentive for them to keep 

3653
02:53:26,351 --> 02:53:27,250
funding you?
But if you,

3654
02:53:27,251 --> 02:53:30,220
if you're always showing positive 
results on supplement studies,

3655
02:53:30,610 --> 02:53:32,250
settlements will.
Companies will want to fund you.

3656
02:53:32,260 --> 02:53:33,340
Of course.
Now of course,

3657
02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:35,350
but you know,
it's so seamlessly,

3658
02:53:35,470 --> 02:53:36,303
so danger.
But I also want people to keep in mind 

3659
02:53:37,520 --> 02:53:40,240
that it's gotta be done in a very 
controlled,

3660
02:53:40,241 --> 02:53:42,250
blinded fashion.
That's the only way around it.

3661
02:53:42,310 --> 02:53:45,040
I keep reminding people like people who 
say things like,

3662
02:53:45,100 --> 02:53:48,280
we found the cure for cancer and the 
government is suppressing it,

3663
02:53:48,281 --> 02:53:50,860
and,
and uh,

3664
02:53:50,861 --> 02:53:51,694
all the scientists are just in the pie.
You what you're saying is you're saying 

3665
02:53:54,101 --> 02:53:58,690
that every scientist on the planet who 
does cancer research is an immoral,

3666
02:53:59,140 --> 02:54:00,250
unethical piece of shit.

3667
02:54:01,060 --> 02:54:01,893
That's what you're saying because you're
just telling me they don't have friends 

3668
02:54:04,781 --> 02:54:08,650
and family who are dealing with cancer 
and they're suppressing this research.

3669
02:54:08,651 --> 02:54:10,030
Come on now.
You know,

3670
02:54:10,031 --> 02:54:11,560
and that's,
that's the other big.

3671
02:54:11,930 --> 02:54:12,763
I'm a,
I'm a small government guy and I'm like 

3672
02:54:14,651 --> 02:54:15,484
I said Libertarian,
but one of the things that makes me 

3673
02:54:16,811 --> 02:54:17,644
cringe about libertarian sometimes as 
these big elaborate conspiracy theories 

3674
02:54:20,651 --> 02:54:21,484
that come up around science and whatnot,
like you realize like a senator can't 

3675
02:54:24,041 --> 02:54:24,874
even a text,
a dick pic to is his side chick without 

3676
02:54:27,641 --> 02:54:29,410
like,
it winded up all over twitter.

3677
02:54:29,411 --> 02:54:31,690
You think they constructed these big 
elaborate theories.

3678
02:54:31,691 --> 02:54:35,080
They can't even tie their shoes in the 
morning without spending $10,000.

3679
02:54:35,081 --> 02:54:35,914
You know?
So the idea that like all this research 

3680
02:54:37,961 --> 02:54:41,920
is being suppressed by the government.
I'm not saying it's never happened,

3681
02:54:41,921 --> 02:54:45,760
but I think it's pretty darn rare.
Well Gentlemen,

3682
02:54:45,761 --> 02:54:48,790
we just did three plus hours.
Thank you.

3683
02:54:49,490 --> 02:54:54,490
Felt like six.
I'll just appreciate you giving us.

3684
02:54:56,960 --> 02:54:59,470
Thanks for illuminating this stuff,
which is still.

3685
02:54:59,650 --> 02:55:00,483
It's so complex.
That's part of the problem and I think 

3686
02:55:02,471 --> 02:55:03,304
we give you 100 of these shows and we'd 
never cover all the topics are all the 

3687
02:55:06,710 --> 02:55:07,543
issues are all the details and I think 
it's so incredibly difficult for people 

3688
02:55:10,701 --> 02:55:13,580
to find the right diet and program that 
works for them.

3689
02:55:13,690 --> 02:55:14,523
I'd like to add one thing that the 
science is rapidly emerging and the 

3690
02:55:16,961 --> 02:55:17,794
metabolic health summit,
which is happening in a the end of 

3691
02:55:21,610 --> 02:55:24,760
January,
beginning of February next year 2019,

3692
02:55:25,120 --> 02:55:25,953
we'll be bringing in the leading 
scientists that are talking about all 

3693
02:55:29,561 --> 02:55:30,394
the different topics right now including
your weight loss and that's going to be 

3694
02:55:33,011 --> 02:55:33,844
in la.
It's actually there's a flyer in your 

3695
02:55:35,531 --> 02:55:36,364
book there.
If you look inside there giving you a 

3696
02:55:38,591 --> 02:55:39,424
flyer.

3697
02:55:39,510 --> 02:55:40,600
All right,
La,

3698
02:55:40,601 --> 02:55:45,250
a January 31st to February third in Long
Beach Metabolic

3699
02:55:45,250 --> 02:55:46,083
health summit.com.
It's going to be very comprehensive 

3700
02:55:51,190 --> 02:55:53,890
group of,
of basic scientists,

3701
02:55:53,891 --> 02:55:58,420
clinical scientists,
entrepreneurs and people everyday people

3702
02:55:58,480 --> 02:56:01,870
that are just interested in this space.
You going and I will be added.

3703
02:56:01,871 --> 02:56:04,460
I'm helping to sort of organize and 
promote it,

3704
02:56:04,480 --> 02:56:05,313
uh,
but also moderating some of the things 

3705
02:56:06,611 --> 02:56:09,280
we're going to hit on.
Basically every topic that was discussed

3706
02:56:09,281 --> 02:56:12,550
in my last podcast in this podcast,
the leading scientists I'm going to show

3707
02:56:12,551 --> 02:56:13,590
up and heckle.
Yeah.

3708
02:56:13,640 --> 02:56:14,473
So we,
we definitely went lay in there too and 

3709
02:56:15,851 --> 02:56:16,684
I think it would be great to have a 
panel discussion that addresses this 

3710
02:56:19,511 --> 02:56:22,580
with a couple more experts and 
personalities and in that

3711
02:56:23,180 --> 02:56:26,230
it's amazing how much information you 
have to absorb.

3712
02:56:26,550 --> 02:56:27,383
It's really,
I've done so many diet podcasts and am 

3713
02:56:30,221 --> 02:56:32,520
still a moron.
That's why you'll,

3714
02:56:32,650 --> 02:56:34,180
I always tell people,
you know,

3715
02:56:34,690 --> 02:56:35,523
it's hard because if you're not going to
do a degree yourself or do research 

3716
02:56:37,901 --> 02:56:40,000
yourself,
it's so hard to know who,

3717
02:56:40,060 --> 02:56:42,250
like you kind of have to pick people 
that you trust.

3718
02:56:42,550 --> 02:56:43,383
Right?
And it's so hard to know who to trust 

3719
02:56:45,041 --> 02:56:46,960
because there was something that,
uh,

3720
02:56:47,050 --> 02:56:47,883
Greg knuckles really smart guy said that
I think kind of ties things together 

3721
02:56:51,371 --> 02:56:52,204
nicely.
He said,

3722
02:56:52,570 --> 02:56:53,403
people are really good at knowing when 
somebody has more knowledge than them 

3723
02:56:55,901 --> 02:56:58,060
about a subject.
Like you talked to somebody for a little

3724
02:56:58,061 --> 02:56:58,894
bit and you,
you really can get an impression pretty 

3725
02:56:59,981 --> 02:57:02,170
quickly if they know more or less than 
you are about the same.

3726
02:57:02,650 --> 02:57:06,730
What they're really bad at doing is 
figuring out amongst two people who know

3727
02:57:06,731 --> 02:57:07,564
more than them,
who is the more knowledgeable of the 

3728
02:57:08,831 --> 02:57:09,580
two.

3729
02:57:09,580 --> 02:57:10,413
They are very bad at picking that out.
So you kinda got to pick people who you 

3730
02:57:14,141 --> 02:57:14,974
trust.
Now,

3731
02:57:15,100 --> 02:57:19,420
if you're looking for people to trust,
notice the three magic words that me and

3732
02:57:19,421 --> 02:57:21,580
him both sit on here today.
At one point,

3733
02:57:21,940 --> 02:57:26,410
I don't know it well.
Usually experts,

3734
02:57:26,680 --> 02:57:29,680
they don't make broad claims.
They don't use superlatives.

3735
02:57:29,710 --> 02:57:32,080
They don't say things like best,
worst,

3736
02:57:32,230 --> 02:57:33,063
never always.
They're usually putting context to 

3737
02:57:35,861 --> 02:57:36,694
everything and they're providing you 
with information that helps illuminate 

3738
02:57:40,691 --> 02:57:42,190
you.
That everything is nuanced.

3739
02:57:42,970 --> 02:57:44,290
And that's why like,
I'm sure,

3740
02:57:44,291 --> 02:57:45,580
again,
I'll relate it to mma.

3741
02:57:45,910 --> 02:57:46,743
If you talk to anybody who's an expert 
in any different discipline and you 

3742
02:57:50,231 --> 02:57:51,064
asked them abroad question,
you're going to get a really broad 

3743
02:57:52,721 --> 02:57:55,150
answer and if you ask them a specific 
question,

3744
02:57:55,151 --> 02:57:57,310
give him a lot of contexts,
then they'll give you a specific answer.

3745
02:57:57,730 --> 02:57:59,260
But I would you agree with that?
Yes,

3746
02:57:59,350 --> 02:58:02,100
definitely.
So I think someone's strong on one

3747
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:02,933
side,
dig kind of deep and look for conflicts 

3748
02:58:04,801 --> 02:58:05,634
of interest to and kind of.
So I think that's kind of an important 

3749
02:58:08,131 --> 02:58:08,964
thing.
I try to be transparent as much as 

3750
02:58:10,261 --> 02:58:12,810
possible on,
on sort of things we're involved in.

3751
02:58:12,840 --> 02:58:16,170
So I think that super important without 
bias too.

3752
02:58:16,171 --> 02:58:18,330
I mean I sell stuff,
I've got a book out,

3753
02:58:18,450 --> 02:58:20,820
I've got another book coming out of a 
website,

3754
02:58:21,110 --> 02:58:21,943
you know,
so it's.

3755
02:58:21,990 --> 02:58:23,070
Yeah,
but you're not actually.

3756
02:58:23,160 --> 02:58:26,160
Well not advocating any particular 
approach,

3757
02:58:26,161 --> 02:58:29,880
you're kind of approaching it from what 
I'm selling isn't really sexy.

3758
02:58:29,881 --> 02:58:34,881
They're complete contest prep guide and 
this is available on all those places.

3759
02:58:35,310 --> 02:58:37,080
[inaudible] dot com,
[inaudible] dot com.

3760
02:58:37,230 --> 02:58:39,420
And your twitter,
bio lane,

3761
02:58:39,690 --> 02:58:41,370
instagram,
bio lane.

3762
02:58:41,640 --> 02:58:42,473
And Dom yet a kito nutrition.org
and a ketone technologies as our 

3763
02:58:47,071 --> 02:58:48,420
company.
Uh,

3764
02:58:48,450 --> 02:58:51,150
it's an information website.
I don't have any products per se,

3765
02:58:51,151 --> 02:58:51,984
at least not yet,
but I put products on there that I 

3766
02:58:54,001 --> 02:58:57,000
personally use and kind of vetted out 
that I think could be helpful.

3767
02:58:57,030 --> 02:58:57,863
And just a lot of information like your,
your prior podcast with me is on their 

3768
02:59:00,850 --> 02:59:05,850
costs in a and Tim Ferriss and Rhonda 
Patrick to have right on the front page.

3769
02:59:07,380 --> 02:59:09,840
Your twitter and instagram.
Yeah.

3770
02:59:09,870 --> 02:59:13,320
Uh,
dominic d'agostino dot Katie.

3771
02:59:13,350 --> 02:59:15,840
I think his instagram,
not a huge instagram back,

3772
02:59:15,930 --> 02:59:18,660
but a Degas Dino,
d a g O,

3773

s t I two a is my twitter handle.
Uh,

3774
02:59:23,070 --> 02:59:26,870
and Dominic D'agostino for facebook too.
So there were three gentlemen,

3775
02:59:26,880 --> 02:59:29,120
I think we got a lot accomplished today.
Thank you so much.

3776
02:59:29,190 --> 02:59:30,120
Really appreciate,
appreciate,

3777
02:59:30,150 --> 02:59:31,080
appreciate it.
Thanks Joe.
