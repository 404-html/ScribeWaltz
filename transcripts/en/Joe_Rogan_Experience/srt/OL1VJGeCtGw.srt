1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,920
There it goes.
Now it's recording.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,390
Alright ladies.
Gentlemen,

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,630
what's up?
Welcome to the weekly podcast.

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,040
I think it's like week 2000.
What week is it Brian?

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,400
Twenty fourth week.
Brian is on top of shits on 24th week.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,720
And join today is a Jujitsu master 
musician,

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,480
best friend Eddie the twister.
Bravo.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,660
Ladies and gentlemen,
how about a big round of applause for 

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:29,660
Mr.
Eddie Bravo.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,600
Joining us here today.
Eddie just had some pizza.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,070
Fuck that.
Diet up son.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,840
Fucked it up.
Yeah,

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,750
I got a hold of.
Got Real.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,870
We've got a real mix now,
man.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,230
Solidarity if you want.
Cool.

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,960
When you talk right into it,
it makes it so much better.

17
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:45,090
We were having problems when we first 
started doing this.

18
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,570
We just figured out how to do a podcast 
basically without asking anybody.

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,710
We just trial and error and we fucked a 
lot of shit up and.

20
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:53,880
But the biggest thing we fucked up in 
the beginning was the sound.

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,210
The sound was really bad at first,
but now we've got that shit locked down 

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,570
so that's good.
What are you doing?

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,830
He's practicing.

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Hold the mic like this.
It's like smoking a cigarette and 

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:08,800
France.
What movie is this front?

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,400
There's a movie where a guy singing 
karaoke and he's holding the mic like 

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:12,530
that.

28
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,650
There's a many used to hang it in front 
of his face like this.

29
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,710
I don't remember who it was like you're 
sucking a cock right here.

30
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,080
Well,
I've never said it.

31
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,890
That flashlight.
Yes,

32
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,900
it was.
Before we go anywhere.

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,920
We're sponsored by the fleshlight.
This podcast is a sponsored park at 

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,140
podcast,
but I'll be quite honest with you,

35
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:33,430
if we were not sponsored by the 
fleshlight and um,

36
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,470
we just,
we just became a subject of the 

37
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:38,470
conversation of the podcast.
I will tell you,

38
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,340
go buy one of those fucking things are 
awesome.

39
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,470
Don't be embarrassed.
Everybody jerks off.

40
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,700
It's silly.
You know,

41
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:46,280
if you jerk off and you wouldn't fuck a 
rubber pussy,

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,050
you're crazy all.
It's just pleasure.

43
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,410
It's just pleasure.
And it feels way better than jerk.

44
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:51,630
I got

45
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,760
a good flashlight story.
Yeah.

46
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,400
Oh,
let's hear.

47
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,800
It's about when I bought it about maybe 
like,

48
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,190
I've,
I've had it for awhile.

49
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,840
I haven't.
I've used it maybe a 20 times right now.

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,960
It's fucking pretty good if you're going
to jerk off something about your own 

51
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,160
hand touching your cock,
cancels out some feeling or something,

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,400
it doesn't feel as good as someone else 
jerking you off or whatever.

53
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,850
So that's where the fleshlight comes in.
I mean,

54
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,230
that's it.
It feels pretty fucking good.

55
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:22,300
You got the right part or whatever.
But anyways,

56
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,960
about three years ago,
maybe two years ago,

57
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,200
I met this girl,
uh,

58
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,130
when we were on the road in Texas 
somewhere,

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,080
maybe Houston or Dallas or something 
like that.

60
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:35,020
I was on the road with you met her and 
um,

61
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,780
we kept in touch.
She came out to La and um,

62
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,050
hung out for a weekend and for some 
reason she wasn't down at all.

63
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,060
She wasn't,
she wasn't done at all.

64
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,970
She didn't want to.
She didn't want me to touch her.

65
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:52,971
Now she's staying at my fucking house 
and she doesn't even want to touch me 

66
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:57,680
and kiss her or nothing.
So I decided to take her to the hustler 

67
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,120
store and go shopping for a fleshlight 
this thing.

68
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,610
So she couldn't fucking believe that she
thought I was kidding.

69
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,560
Then I went to the store to buy a 
flashlight.

70
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,010
I'm like,
Hey,

71
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,510
if you're not going to give me the 
pussy,

72
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,570
I got to know this is the second best 
thing.

73
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,970
Can invite another girl over here.
So,

74
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:14,750
um,
that's my fleshlight store.

75
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:17,960
I used it that night too while she 
passed out and in.

76
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,220
Just cool.
It's pretty cool.

77
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,310
It's better than using your hands.
It's better than using your hand.

78
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,370
If you had,
if you could hire a Mexican to clean it 

79
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:29,370
up afterwards,
then it would be awesome.

80
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,780
It's just the cleanup Mexican.
Why does it have to be a Mexican man?

81
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,250
They worked cheap.
You're going to put a white male,

82
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,100
white dude to clean up your flashlight 
when you're done.

83
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,640
You got to go to home depot and pick up 
a couple of guys and they'll switch off

84
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,020
target the other day.
And there was these things called magic 

85
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,081
microphones for kids.
It's a kid's toy that looks just like a 

86
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:51,081
fleshlight.
If you look at it,

87
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:51,360
you're like,
oh,

88
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:54,790
the same company that makes flashlights 
must also make this mike on my God.

89
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,090
And so I pick it up and I go to my 
girlfriend,

90
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:57,540
like,
look,

91
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,610
they got flashlights here and right.
I look.

92
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:00,810
I'm like,
oh stupid.

93
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:03,000
I look around.
There's kids everywhere in mom's looking

94
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:05,400
at me and if I cough,
fuck yes.

95
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,060
It's funny how it's got a bad,
like,

96
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,160
you know,
there's a bad feeling attached to it 

97
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,160
that there's something wrong with this 
rubber pussy.

98
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,180
There's something wrong with pleasure.
If it was just a massage thing,

99
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,140
it was just like,
look,

100
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:18,270
I got a massage and makes your backfill.
Awesome.

101
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,910
Everybody be like,
oh cool guys.

102
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,030
Making is backfill.
Awesome.

103
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,430
There's something about making your dick
feel awesome.

104
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:26,670
That freaks everybody out.
Which would freak out if your son.

105
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,830
I was using the flashlight at 11.
Would that be bad?

106
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,620
No.
Right?

107
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,250
No,
not at all.

108
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,400
First Birthday,
right?

109
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:33,430
I would say,
listen man,

110
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:38,230
you're body is a biological organism 
that doesn't understand you know,

111
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,710
your life.
It wants you to make decisions for it,

112
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,920
not for you.
So it's going to try to trick you into 

113
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:46,930
fucking someone with no condom and 
having babies.

114
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,370
I mean,
that's what your body's trying to do.

115
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,490
And it can get real confusing who you 
actually like as opposed to like who 

116
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,220
your Dick is telling you,
you like,

117
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,880
you know when you're horny all the time,
you,

118
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,930
your Dick convinces you that you like 
people you don't even like just because 

119
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:00,930
you could fuck them,
you know.

120
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,310
And for a kid when you're just learning 
how to get into relationships,

121
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,490
that shit's very tricky.
I think every young kid could benefit 

122
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,850
from.
They should teach kids how to jerk off 

123
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,011
in school.
They should teach kids how your Dick is 

124
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:14,290
going to confuse you and how it's going 
to send you all these messages.

125
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,290
And being horny is actually a baffling 
thing that takes years and years to 

126
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,200
master.
And they can make.

127
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:25,000
Hannah Montana flashlights came at 
$20,000,000,000

128
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:27,280
industry.
I wonder if that would be illegal if she

129
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:29,560
sponsored a fleshlight for high school 
kids.

130
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:34,000
And she's not saying it's safe sex.
Would that be insane?

131
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,200
Why not,
right?

132
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,490
Yeah,
that'd be so smart.

133
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,610
I mean,
we really pretending the kids aren't 

134
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:41,610
fucking,
you know,

135
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,100
kids get to be 16 years old.
She's like 16 or 17.

136
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,140
They're fucking man.
They're fucking,

137
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,100
the problem is even if she wants to like
talk about it and shit,

138
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,950
it's still illegal,
you know,

139
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,610
it's still,
it's,

140
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,340
they're not supposed to be fucking and 
no one's supposed to be fucking them.

141
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,260
That's like older than them.
I think they go to jail.

142
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:58,150
You know,
if you're,

143
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,250
if you're 18 and your girlfriend is 17 
years and 10 months and you fucker,

144
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,600
you go to jail.
Is that really happening?

145
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,150
Yes.
Yeah.

146
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:07,830
Yeah.
And people have gotten that bad.

147
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,510
Yeah.
It's real.

148
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,070
God Damn it.
Know what's happening.

149
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:15,071
That's even scarier than that is a gang 
of kids are getting popped for child 

150
00:06:15,071 --> 00:06:19,481
pornography for taking pictures with 
their pussies on their fucking cell 

151
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:19,481
phones.
Oh Shit.

152
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:20,900
Those are dicks.
That's really what's happening,

153
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:23,280
man.
Down to getting in trouble,

154
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,920
going it criminal tools.
A girl was arrested on child pornography

155
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,110
charges because she sent.
She's 15 years old.

156
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,320
She sent pictures of herself to a bunch 
of kids in their class and they 

157
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,870
eventually dropped the child pornography
charges,

158
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,410
but they charged with one count of using
criminal tools.

159
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,330
The criminal tool was a cell phone.
That was a account they had against her.

160
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,550
She took a cell phone to take a picture 
of her pussy.

161
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,880
So that was a criminal tool.
You that guys delete all that shit.

162
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,600
How crazy is that man?
Think about what it would be like.

163
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,230
Was your daughter and you found out that
your daughter was doing the same thing?

164
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:03,231
I think we talked about guys here.
You guys talk about the exact same 

165
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:03,231
thing.
The flashlight.

166
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:03,590
Sorry guys.
Just love talking about it.

167
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,850
Denies The fleshlight store.
Sexting.

168
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,870
Sexting.
Oh,

169
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:10,500
the sex thing we talked about last time.
It's still fascinating.

170
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,830
Very important part of it.
Pay attention to that twitter feed.

171
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:18,831
Brian,
I don't really want to know what people 

172
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:18,831
want us to talk about.
Shut that shit off.

173
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:20,400
That shit drives me crazy.
You freaking me out,

174
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:21,180
son.
Wait,

175
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:22,760
isn't that what we got here?
Yeah,

176
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,240
this is freaking me out too,
but I don't read it.

177
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,230
Don't read it too much,
man.

178
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,070
Then you're going to change the subject 
of your conversation.

179
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,160
Listening to what they're saying.
You're getting too serious about this,

180
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:32,730
Joe.
No,

181
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:34,410
I'm not getting serious.
It's distracting.

182
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,970
It's distracting for good conversation.

183
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,970
So what'd you guys think about the new 
iphone that just was announced 

184
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,041
yesterday?
It was pretty crazy that the iphone is 

185
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:43,110
a.
is going to change a lot of Shit,

186
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:44,400
man.
First of all,

187
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,470
everyone's going to be using it for 
phone sex because you could see the 

188
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:49,470
other person.
You could see them.

189
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,040
That's what's fucked up because I was 
thinking about this the other day.

190
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,230
You know how texting and twitter and 
everything's fucking up.

191
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,500
People's games are just lies in general.
Now people are going to be like,

192
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:00,360
your ex is going to call you or your 
girl is going to call you go,

193
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,320
where are you at right now?
You're like,

194
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:02,820
I'm with my friends.
Oh yeah,

195
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:05,040
we'll turn on your video.
Let me see where you're at.

196
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,610
You know,
and that's going to happen with boss,

197
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,800
which doesn't have any Wifi.
Well that's the only.

198
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,240
That's only for 2010.
That's just because att and t is trying 

199
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,961
to build up their network.
The network is ever going to get built 

200
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:21,081
up where they can handle two way phone 
calls with everybody because you know 

201
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:21,620
people are going to leave that shit on 
and they're going to.

202
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,430
You're going to come to work with me.
Okay.

203
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:25,620
And they're going to be walking around.
People aren't going to be watching where

204
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:26,540
they're going.
Absolutely.

205
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,580
That's why your phone,
that's why a t and t regulated their 

206
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,280
data plans the other day because they 
know that that shit's going to happen.

207
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,760
So do you think they're just building up
to it?

208
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:39,030
How are they going to be like when 
texting first came out,

209
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:41,880
when you first got texting,
everyone said this is not going to work.

210
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:46,881
No one's going to ever do this,
but in texting plans are really 

211
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:46,881
expensive and ridiculous,
you know,

212
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,020
because all these newcomers are,
you know,

213
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,150
used to get jokes about texting.

214
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,570
I just hit my fucking 2005 showtime 
special.

215
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,740
There's a joke in there when I'm like,
it takes you four presses to get an s.

216
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,510
Why you?
Why don't you just fucking call me?

217
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:02,130
What are you doing?
Are you making me read?

218
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,010
Right?
You know,

219
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,360
this is going to be exactly like,
just think about how much that's changed

220
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,950
in five years.
You have video content,

221
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,710
video calling in five years from now is 
going to be the norm.

222
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:11,760
You,
that's all it's going to be.

223
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:16,761
It's not going to be.
People are gonna Laugh at you from 

224
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:16,761
normal calling,
you know,

225
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:16,761
I think.
I think that's,

226
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:17,610
you know,
we're going towards star trek.

227
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,070
We are,
we are.

228
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,180
It's going to be called something to 
like when someone like a girlfriend 

229
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,180
calls you up and facetime,
I need a Web,

230
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,970
a web cam scan,
you know what I mean?

231
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:26,630
Okay.
Here's the way.

232
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,810
So you've got to tell all your buddies 
that used to be at a party and go web 

233
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,690
cams.
All the girls duck under and go,

234
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:33,040
look,
look,

235
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:33,590
honey,
I'm here.

236
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,820
Boom.
Oh look it.

237
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:39,821
Then Bam.
A quick little ones over to you just 

238
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:41,690
have the whole Party spin behind you.
Just move really slowly.

239
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,520
It's the web cam scan.
Fucking moving fast enough.

240
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,490
Okay.
You better web cam scan right now.

241
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Inner Circle.
As quick as you can show me after a 

242
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:57,680
while.
You're gonna have to do a quick,

243
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,820
it can't be fast,
but then people are just going to get 

244
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:02,820
faster.
They're just gonna be.

245
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,980
It's going to be a sport.
You know,

246
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,990
you will have gambling to see whether or
not you can tell those people in the 

247
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:08,990
room.
Okay,

248
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,050
let's go into the bathroom.
It's to look behind the curtain.

249
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,970
Okay,
now let's go to the back.

250
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,370
Cool fucking game.
How about this game?

251
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,610
How about you?
You have a game where you bet whether or

252
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:21,611
not someone is in someone's house and 
someone takes you on a tour of their 

253
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:21,980
house and you bet whether or not this 
other people in the house hiding.

254
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,330
How about you have every recorded 
prerecorded fucking scenarios.

255
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:29,190
You have like 30 of them,
your house one,

256
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:34,191
you're at your mom's,
you have all these files and then you 

257
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:36,050
know they think it's live,
but it's really a a video.

258
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,650
We got to get on that.
You don't have a problem with it.

259
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,690
You would have to show your face too.
You're supposed to show your face 

260
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:42,780
talking environment.
They're going to have to.

261
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,760
It would be like almost like a green 
screen.

262
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,790
The great joy ideas.
When I was talking to him about this,

263
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,190
Joey Diaz says he's going to be like,
imagine calling your girl and go,

264
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,500
let me see your pussy right now.
See how red it is.

265
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,270
I know what it looks like after you got 
fucked.

266
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:55,960
Hold it up against white.
Let me see

267
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,000
the color

268
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,800
showing her pussy.
Yeah.

269
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:01,750
Yeah,
because then we.

270
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,830
Because seriously,
that's how it's going to come down to.

271
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:08,831
You're going to be able to just go,
let me see what your pussy looks like 

272
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:09,200
right now.
I can tell you that statement.

273
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,010
That that just shows you the mentality 
of Joey ideas.

274
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,410
How Funny Joey is.
Joey is thinking about tricking girls in

275
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:16,190
the show and their pussy.

276
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,460
You know,
he's all about.

277
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:19,660
No,
no,

278
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,940
no,
no,

279
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:21,260
no.
I need to see it right now.

280
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:21,950
Come on,
let's go.

281
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,820
What do you got?
Like it's all about.

282
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,610
It's all about like trapping them in the
show,

283
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:28,350
in their pussy.
It's not even really asking them.

284
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:30,090
It's like part of the hustle for it.
For Joey.

285
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:30,840
You trick them.

286
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,440
I think it's gonna.
I think it's gonna make people a lot 

287
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,541
more faithful because I really believe 
that like twitter and facebook and 

288
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,350
facebook has really.
It makes it so hard to cheat.

289
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,550
People are like,
okay,

290
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,890
if I'm going to,
there's a lot more single people because

291
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:48,891
it's way too hard and a cheat,
but if you decide to have a girlfriend 

292
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:48,891
or boyfriend,
you're like,

293
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:49,740
fuck it.
I ain't even going to try.

294
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,750
You make a comment on one person's 
picture.

295
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,010
Everybody knows that you just commented 
on

296
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,410
some girl's picture,
you know,

297
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,530
so it's like you don't even,
you don't even bother,

298
00:11:57,531 --> 00:12:00,700
so you might as well be faith and it's 
not going to stay where it's at.

299
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,730
It's gonna,
it's gonna move on to some next 

300
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,531
craziness and I,
I think that has to do with this iphone 

301
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:09,991
camera.
I think that's the next stage of 

302
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:11,491
craziness.
The next stage of intrusion into 

303
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:11,491
people's lives and some people are going
to reject it.

304
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:13,470
You know?
Did you do just like textbook?

305
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,780
Just like texts,
just like picture messages.

306
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,820
So like everything.
That's why when people are freaking out 

307
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:20,820
about flash,
it's.

308
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:20,820
I feel the same thing about that.
You know,

309
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,780
you people are freaking out because 
you're not thinking ahead,

310
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,700
you're not,
you're not thinking about what's next or

311
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:27,130
what's going to be the future.
You just say freaking them out.

312
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:31,650
Flash for the non technologically a 
macromedia flash what?

313
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:36,370
Macromedia flash is a program on your 
websites when you see like animation and

314
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:37,680
different kinds of like,
you know,

315
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,270
you put your cursor over something and 
it does some funky thing.

316
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:45,450
Most of the time you're dealing with 
flash and a lot of these sites and 

317
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,211
apparently flash crashes a lot.
I've had a crush a bunch of times on me 

318
00:12:48,211 --> 00:12:50,260
and Microsoft has their own version of 
shit.

319
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:51,220
What is it?
Silver Light.

320
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,990
So yeah,
but what's cool is that there's actually

321
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:57,130
companies now that have software that if
you put it into flash,

322
00:12:57,131 --> 00:13:02,131
and I guess flash is working with this 
company that if you go to this website 

323
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:05,881
and it has flash,
flash will detect that you do not have 

324
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:07,930
flash on your ipad or whatever and it 
will convert it into an html five point.

325
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,260
Oh uh,
a program or whatever.

326
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:12,730
So that's what youtube does.

327
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,330
No,
I think youtube just uses a different 

328
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,550
CODEC.
There's some websites where you can go 

329
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,710
to on the IPAD and you can still watch 
videos and that's html five.

330
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:21,970
You're watching,
you're watching it.

331
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:25,660
Just a flashes has moved on from our 
youtube.

332
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:29,380
Doesn't use flash as much anymore.
It uses I a Codec h two point six,

333
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:30,070
four,
I believe.

334
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,020
Uh,
so it's not even in flash anymore.

335
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:33,050
You're watching it.
Just,

336
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,370
you're just watching a video file.
I think you're right that people are 

337
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,060
hesitant to change and then they worry 
about flash falling apart and you know,

338
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,330
they say,
oh this is crazy.

339
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:43,060
You know,
my website is coded like this and that's

340
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:48,090
just how it should be.
But when new shit comes along that's 

341
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:48,090
better.
You just got to accept it,

342
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,280
you know?
I think what's more fascinating to me 

343
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,170
than anything is a facetime thing and 
the,

344
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,370
the rise of the droid phones do a droid 
phones or luck an infection.

345
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,370
There's like so many Goddamn droid 
phones now and they do everything the 

346
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,061
iphone does and more like,
you know what the iphone has,

347
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,600
you know,
the front face feature.

348
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:09,790
That's a camera.
Come on.

349
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,930
Blackberry,
blackberry,

350
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,170
blackberry.
Still number one droids nothing new.

351
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:16,430
It's just an operating system like 
windows mobile wise.

352
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,890
These are dope ass phones.
Dope.

353
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,680
Dope.
As phones that are doing something 

354
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:24,680
that's trying to be like an iphone now,
you know,

355
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,810
I mean,
and it's not doing it as good.

356
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:30,160
If you use any application on a droid 
and compare it to the iphone version,

357
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,790
almost 99 point nine percent of the time
it falls a little short.

358
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,190
Okay.
If,

359
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,200
uh,
you're saying this based on the little 

360
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,200
experience that you had.
No,

361
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,200
no,
no.

362
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,980
I've had it for a month.
I used to straight for a month and I 

363
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,730
know from that operating system what 
they were doing back then is the same as

364
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:47,440
now it's all the same.
It's the exact same.

365
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,140
I use the newest one that had the newest
version.

366
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,070
It's the to Motorola

367
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,640
droid.
Right.

368
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,220
Which is not supposed to be as good as 
this htc evo.

369
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,240
You're talking about the hardware 
though.

370
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,470
You're not talking about the operating 
system.

371
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,610
Yeah,
but I mean didn't,

372
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,820
didn't the,
I'm just an htc alter the operating 

373
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,670
system a little bit.
It puts a skin on it that just makes it.

374
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,700
That's all it is.
It's just a skin off the operating 

375
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,621
systems.
We make your work more effectively and 

376
00:15:11,621 --> 00:15:11,621
some say that hurts.
Some say it's better.

377
00:15:11,621 --> 00:15:13,760
You know what it does is it gives you a 
nice little widget at the front that has

378
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:15,010
the weather and a bunch of shit.
Okay.

379
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,510
Well just saying that the iphone is 
better.

380
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:18,550
Okay.
I'll agree with you.

381
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:23,551
You believe the iphone is better,
but it's still a fucking amazing phone 

382
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:24,500
and if it was.
If it existed a year ago,

383
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,520
you.
You'd be freaking the fuck out of 

384
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:29,520
existed five years ago.

385
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:29,520
It'd be world changing.
Five years ago.

386
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,980
I would probably be freaking out a year 
ago.

387
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:34,190
I doubt it.
It's a very impressive phone.

388
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,960
Yeah.
That phone hardware itself is great,

389
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,110
but when you compare like somebody was 
going off on the other day about how 

390
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,110
like,
Oh yeah,

391
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,150
this has an eight mega pixel camera or 
the new iphone only has a five megapixel

392
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,140
camera,
and I was like,

393
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,820
mega pixels don't mean shit.
That's why like every year we've stopped

394
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,420
like at 12 megapixels for most cameras 
and if you notice like most Sony cameras

395
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:55,910
that were 12 megapixels last year,
now 10 megapixel.

396
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:57,560
Okay,
well why doesn't mean shit?

397
00:15:57,561 --> 00:16:02,561
I mean those guys.
Mega pixels doesn't mean much 

398
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:02,760
information is in the photograph and 
mega pixels don't mean shit.

399
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,240
It means something.
Camera sucks.

400
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:08,300
We know that 12 megapixel cameras,
awesome.

401
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,060
You could blow up giant bill bright's.
So it does mean something.

402
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,580
It means something to us,
it means something to a point.

403
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:16,760
But the most important thing is the lens
and the actual,

404
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,990
the,
the quality of photo.

405
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,800
That's why.
Okay,

406
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,290
that makes sense.
That makes a new.

407
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:25,340
The new iphone camera has a,
what most normal camels are just 

408
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,760
switching to.
It's this a coil that goes around the 

409
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,350
lens and it used to be where the coil 
was in front of the lens optics.

410
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:34,930
So when you take a photo,
uh,

411
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:40,140
the,
the light has to go through all these 

412
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,921
coils in order to take a photo.
So now they found out how to fight the 

413
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:41,921
coil on the back.
So the light,

414
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:43,760
there's more light that goes in that 
goes in there.

415
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:47,390
So many calls that the Xmo our lens,
whatever it's called,

416
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,560
but now so now this new iphone's going 
to have better low light just because 

417
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,300
they decided to do this new coil 
technology.

418
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,350
So that alone photo,
quality megapixel doesn't mean shit.

419
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,990
It really means something.
Now Brian,

420
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
you're getting crazy.
No,

421
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:01,140
no,
no,

422
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,570
no.
I'm being serious.

423
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:07,690
Megapixels did not mean shit anymore 
when it comes to like five megapixels 

424
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,070
and above eight megapixels,
like 10 to 12 megapixels.

425
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,720
There's nothing.
Eight to 12.

426
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,780
There's barely anything,
but it still means something.

427
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:19,830
Unless you're doing billboards.
It's what's important is the lens and 

428
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,500
how important the software they use.
It's also important.

429
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,510
You know what kind of,
you know how the.

430
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:28,570
That's why you have these Carl Zeiss 
lenses and shit on all these different 

431
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:28,570
phones.
You know,

432
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,510
they're trying to get the dopest lens as
possible.

433
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,440
Yeah,
I agree.

434
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:33,500
Over a certain point it's negligible and
you're a bad motherfucker.

435
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:37,100
You knowledge of all this shit is 
unbelievable.

436
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:40,010
You frequent it comes to this stuff.
But what I think of the iphone,

437
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,500
who knows when I get it,
but God it,

438
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,950
they just solved everything.
They got the video camera sucked.

439
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,110
I use it all the time,
but it's not now it's HP.

440
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,680
It's.
Yeah,

441
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:49,980
that's still true.
Yeah,

442
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,980
for sure.
But it's even,

443
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,920
you know,
for me,

444
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,890
I barely talk on the phone anyways.
I really don't give a shit.

445
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,060
What I care about is video pictures and 
texting.

446
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,760
That's huge.
And emails and stuff and then you get on

447
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,510
twitter and all that stops to a 
credible.

448
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:06,440
I don't care about talking to Peter's 
applications

449
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,530
on your phone that you can time rounds 
with.

450
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,050
It was like a gym boss where you can 
time your workouts,

451
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,230
you can,
it's a free application to you.

452
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,300
You could set it so that it'll like,
it'll put interval training into your 

453
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,661
workouts and give you like different 
alarms like when you run and when you 

454
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:21,661
stop,
when you rest,

455
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:21,661
when you go.

456
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:25,760
I mean the flash,
that Webcam at the HD video,

457
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,660
five megapixels,
God damn think

458
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,730
these,
um,

459
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,280
these new droid phones are catching up

460
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,400
though.
They're totally catching up and I hope 

461
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,381
they beat the iphone,
but the problem is if all these droid 

462
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:38,381
user saying,
Oh fuck,

463
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:38,381
fuck,
iphone,

464
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:38,381
no,
no,

465
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:43,360
get this.
How's your facebook and you want to do 

466
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:43,970
like a comparison.
How is your facebook on your application

467
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:45,510
facebook and compared to iphones,
apple,

468
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,490
twitter in a while.
Right?

469
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,380
Don't they update those food?
I am on every single website everyday on

470
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:56,381
both the joy and everything.
I know exactly what's going on with 

471
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:58,450
android versus iphone every day.
Oh no,

472
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:00,710
totally common.
Is that a common argument?

473
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:02,630
Dude?
It's common with down the line.

474
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,660
Every program that you get for the 
iphone is it's way more fine tuned on 

475
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,381
the iphone for some reason.
I don't know if it's on purpose or if 

476
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:12,500
it's just the length or the,
you know that developers or what,

477
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:15,610
but like even the twitter applications 
and the same with the palm tree.

478
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,010
The palm pre should have been fucking 
the number one phone.

479
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,750
That should have been way bigger than it
was,

480
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,170
but the problem is every single 
application like their facebook,

481
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:27,050
their twitter and everything,
it doesn't even come close to the iphone

482
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:27,840
and it's still

483
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,380
killed them.
You don't think that it was on sprint.

484
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,850
I can tell you as having a palm pre plus
that every single program that you can 

485
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,570
download for that thing sucks.
Shit.

486
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,540
Compared to the iphone versions and the 
pump has been out for a year plus longer

487
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,390
than the web.
So that'll be doing shit doing shit.

488
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,260
No,
they are.

489
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,330
It's interesting because the palm pre 
was like the number one selling product 

490
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,541
that a sprint that have launched as a 
phone until this a htc evo came along 

491
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,690
and they're saying this pump everything.
It's really what's.

492
00:19:57,691 --> 00:20:00,000
What's interesting about it was it was 
like the number one thing,

493
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:02,190
but then it petered out and nobody gives
a fuck about it.

494
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:07,550
You know,
like no one's like in line to get palm 

495
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:07,550
trees.

496
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:07,550
Not at all.
Actually.

497
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,680
Remember the trio,
the trio with the trio.

498
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,610
You gave me a second.
The trio was the was.

499
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,680
That was the original trio was a brick 
bro.

500
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,710
I remember wanting to bother me.
I remember when you gave me your trio,

501
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:22,670
dude,
that first day.

502
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:23,600
I couldn't believe it,
man.

503
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:28,601
I thought I was just.
I really thought like I had a fucking 

504
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:30,770
time and watching.
I swear I thought.

505
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,880
I said,
look,

506
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:33,620
I just think it's so awesome.
I remember I had,

507
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:38,621
when I first got it,
I got it out of the box and everything 

508
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:38,621
that I was playing with and I was like 
looking at Wayne.

509
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:43,280
I was like,
this is the ultimate piece that's like 

510
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,790
star Trek.
It's like a fucking computer in my 

511
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:45,790
pocket,
man.

512
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,860
Never good thing.
Is the texting on the or

513
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,390
that.
Just the keyboard alone.

514
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,610
Have you ever used the keyboard?
No.

515
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:56,611
You know what I did use though,
that was pretty dope and I wish someone 

516
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:57,520
would figure out how to do it.
I found sorta doesn't,

517
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,460
but I had with my Microsoft phone,
I had a windows,

518
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:05,461
windows mobile phones.
It knew the words that I was going to 

519
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:07,210
use,
like if I would press a and then B,

520
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:07,750
it would.
Right,

521
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,780
absolutely.
If I've said that a bunch of times and 

522
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,000
text before and then you just hit the 
space button and you keep going onto the

523
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,470
next predictive texting.
Yeah,

524
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,750
but like,
like crazy good man.

525
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:18,460
It was really good.
It was really interesting.

526
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,120
The iphone always gets things wrong and 
never wants to accept my swears.

527
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,610
I still wasn't changed.
Fuck to duck.

528
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,720
I mean,
how many times do I say this?

529
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,710
There's ways around that.

530
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,780
There's something like you just make a 
new contact and you just put all the 

531
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,540
cuss words you want in it or something 
like I forget.

532
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,260
Something like that.
And so it looks it up.

533
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,350
Yeah,
I do.

534
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,910
I think you just make a contact and go,
fuck cock suck Dick Piss.

535
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,040
You know everything you want.
Yeah.

536
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,670
You just do it once a.
yeah,

537
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,130
I know,
but it's so silly.

538
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,150
Like why can't it remember swears?
Well,

539
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:52,151
the new operating system,
I guess as 100 times better when it 

540
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:52,151
comes to all this,
like the Vocab,

541
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:53,490
that dictionary that everything and it's
got.

542
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Now we finally get multitasking.
Now Brian's got an apple phone or on 

543
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,270
your fan.
Boy,

544
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,130
I'm not a fan boy because I'm with any 
kind of technology.

545
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:06,560
I try them all and I.
I picked my man.

546
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,990
I'm just teasing you.
How many phones,

547
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,510
how many phones have we both between 
you?

548
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,220
Haven't we always go right back to the 
iphone.

549
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,540
The iphone is most certainly the best 
all around device without a doubt,

550
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,840
but my main phone,
I use a blackberry because it's verizon 

551
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,630
because verizon is way better for me.
I need,

552
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,390
I need to make calls like that game's 
over for me now.

553
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,690
Really?
I have no problems with a t and t 

554
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,121
anymore and in Los Angeles.
Well my problems with a t and t are 

555
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:33,610
driving,
driving from my house into legends.

556
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:38,611
Others.
There's three places where I would lose 

557
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:40,261
people,
so if I'd be in a big conversation I'd 

558
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:40,261
have to pull over because I didn't want 
to.

559
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:41,050
I didn't want to lose the call.
If it was something that was,

560
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,030
you know,
it was serious.

561
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,230
I can't talk in my bedroom on the phone.
If,

562
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,770
if I,
if I want to talk,

563
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:50,410
I got to go to my living room if it's an
important call.

564
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,240
I walked down the street,
I actually,

565
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,340
I'm,
if you see me talking on the phone,

566
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,720
walking at some important as shit right 
there,

567
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,490
don't bother me.
Eventually there's going to be no home.

568
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:02,740
Phone's right.
There is barely any home phones.

569
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:03,540
I hardly know.
My,

570
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,270
my dad doesn't even have a home phone 
anymore and it's like some ancient shit.

571
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,960
You know,
home phone doesn't send no tax,

572
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,020
can't get pictures.
Just some stupid line where people call 

573
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,020
you.
It's funny.

574
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,390
My mom lives in the middle of the 
country.

575
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,250
Urgency in case the world ends.
You need a landline solar flares.

576
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,350
Fuck,
fuck up those satellites.

577
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,300
There was an article I was reading about
that about.

578
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:30,301
We're at a moment of the sons awakening 
and that the next couple years is 

579
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:34,710
unprecedented solar activity.
That's they predicted so unprecedented 

580
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,120
solar flares that could wipe out 
satellites and so what they're trying to

581
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:41,860
get really good at is predicting these 
events so that they can shut down or put

582
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:46,861
these satellites on safe mode,
which is pretty nuts when you think 

583
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:46,861
about how much we're reliant

584
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:49,580
on the satellites and you know for,
for satellite radio.

585
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:51,830
I can listen to it every day for,
you know,

586
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,900
for so many different things.
For GPS,

587
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,600
we're,
you know,

588
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,520
we're reliant on fucking satellites and 
those motherfuckers can get cooked,

589
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,420
they can get cooked.
I mean,

590
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,500
at any time the Sun could just make some
hiccup,

591
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:04,550
a Burp,
a Fart,

592
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,610
and it just barbecues every fucking 
satellite at cs.

593
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:13,130
They got to have backup satellites and 
like just slow out there and protective 

594
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,130
cases.
So if anything happens,

595
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,790
the other ones they just press a button.
That shit.

596
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,140
Yeah.
That opened the new case.

597
00:24:16,141 --> 00:24:17,290
Boom.
What if they're gonna do

598
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,370
put shields over satellites like big 
radiation shields that's going to have 

599
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,780
to be the next field,
something like that before it's filled.

600
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:27,060
It's got to have something to do with 
magnets and force fields.

601
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,510
Well,
yeah,

602
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:29,550
you're right.
Because that's what our gravity is,

603
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,330
right?
Our,

604
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,720
our,
our magnetosphere,

605
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:32,220
right,
right.

606
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,210
And the,
um,

607
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,260
the,
the gas that surrounds the earth and 

608
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,260
the,
you know,

609
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,880
our atmosphere,
we just suspend some gold dust particles

610
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,140
in the atmosphere will be fine.
Zacharias stitch and style.

611
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:46,770
So Eddie's a big proponent of the 
ancient alien theory and a Eddie's the 

612
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:50,230
first person that ever got me into 
Zacharias Hitchin and we've had dude,

613
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:53,820
how many bones have we smoked?
Fucking talking about the auto lock.

614
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,310
We've had more,
more ridiculous

615
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,070
spaceman alien auto knocky 
conversations,

616
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,910
ancient ancient tribe theories.
Shit where,

617
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,940
you know,
civilizations died off and left so much 

618
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,851
information that was just last forever.
Like the Mayans and of course the 

619
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:17,181
Sumerians and now sand the Sumerians 
talk of an even older civilization 

620
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:17,760
before then.
So Eddie,

621
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,710
Eddie's the one that got me into

622
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:19,740
the first.
Scott,

623
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:20,760
right?
It's about Redondo,

624
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:21,410
right?
No,

625
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:21,750
no,
no.

626
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:23,790
He actually,
he brought it up to me.

627
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:24,630
No,
he brought it up,

628
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:26,280
but I didn't.
It never registered.

629
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:26,850
He goes,
dude,

630
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:28,710
listen to this radio station coast to 
coast.

631
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,260
There's like 10 years ago.
And I never listened to Scott.

632
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,350
But Gina,
the first girl I produced musically,

633
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,080
she's about as crazy as they come.
And she's.

634
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,560
She was talking about a party,
talented girl,

635
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,100
super,
super talented singer,

636
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:42,660
but crazy.
She goes,

637
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,840
oh my God.
I was at this party last night and this 

638
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,481
guy was talking about how we recreated 
as slaves to mine gold for aliens on 

639
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:52,770
another planet.
I'm like,

640
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,830
oh my God,
shut up.

641
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,630
Shut the fuck up.
Because no,

642
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,910
everybody was tripping out on this guy 
talking about this.

643
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:01,830
This.
I'm like,

644
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:06,390
aliens made us as slaves to mine gold.
Shut the fuck up.

645
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,780
Let's get to work.
So I thought about it later on that day,

646
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,760
that whole day I thought about it and I 
and I,

647
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,420
and I thought it was weird that it's 
crazy as all that sounded.

648
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,020
It is weird that the one thing that we 
all agree on,

649
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,090
every culture,
every race,

650
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,640
we can agree on shit,
politics,

651
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:24,360
religion,
nothing.

652
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,870
But we all agree that gold is worth more
than money.

653
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,110
That gold is the universal money.
And I thought that was weird.

654
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:32,130
I go,
hmm.

655
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:37,430
And then I thought about how the Aztecs 
thought Cortez was a god and they gave 

656
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:43,221
them gold and then the people,
the pharaohs that die and they get 

657
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:48,261
buried,
they get buried with gold and like 

658
00:26:48,261 --> 00:26:48,480
thinking about this and like this.
Can I call Gina Gina?

659
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,670
What was this guy's name?
Do you have his number?

660
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,250
Because that was Jodie or some guy,
I think his name was Jodie,

661
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,480
so I called this guy and go,
hey,

662
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:59,481
I'm,
I'm a genius because what you were 

663
00:26:59,481 --> 00:27:01,320
talking about some gold and some slaves 
and aliens.

664
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,840
What the fuck was that about?
And he didn't even really know.

665
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,040
He said,
you know what?

666
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:05,460
Yeah,
yeah,

667
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:08,370
I was talking about that.
Some guy told me it was weirdest thing.

668
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:13,610
I think his name is Syed Gen or are such
an or something sits in or something.

669
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:19,131
So I looked it up and I just got on the 
Internet and I looked up sitch and 

670
00:27:19,131 --> 00:27:20,310
started getting into it and it blew me 
away.

671
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:22,170
It's pretty fascinating shit,
you know,

672
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:25,780
as crazy as that sounds,
if you really look into it all,

673
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:30,300
all the basically it's,
it's this at Zachariah such as this guy,

674
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:35,301
the transcribed,
the ancient Sumerian text for like 

675
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:37,550
20,000
tablets have all these stories and all 

676
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,731
this shit.
Who knows what they really say because 

677
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:40,731
very few people can actually transcribe 
it.

678
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:42,480
Uh,
some people think Zacharias stitching is

679
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:45,210
crazy and he just making shit up.
Um,

680
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,740
some,
a lot of people believe him.

681
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,490
I mean,
he's got this,

682
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,260
I mean,
a lot of smart people.

683
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:54,510
Well,
the interesting shit that he uncovers 

684
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:54,510
and shows in his,
um,

685
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,950
in his videos that's just indisputable 
is the images that the Sumerians left 

686
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,881
behind.
That's where it gets really crazy 

687
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,570
because there's images of a big giant 
person with a small person.

688
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,880
It's a person,
but it has a tail like a monkey.

689
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,010
And you're like,
what the fuck is that?

690
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:13,500
They have the double helix,
the DNA double helix is there caduceus,

691
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,760
you know,
they have that in,

692
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:19,770
in their images.
What if it was just like a Fez ben guy 

693
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:19,870
that walked around the tribe,
you know,

694
00:28:19,871 --> 00:28:21,880
that it's dressed up as a cat in 
somebody's true.

695
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,580
Oh,
you know what I mean?

696
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:23,790
It could,
it could be.

697
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,830
But here's the other thing,
they also had a detailed depiction of 

698
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,741
the solar system.
They had a picture of the sun and then 

699
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:31,741
they had the picture of the planets in 
the,

700
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:34,090
with the proper size in the proper orbit
orbit.

701
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,020
And on top of that,
their,

702
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,320
their whole history there,
you know,

703
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:43,590
there's the,
in the Sumerian text it talks about the 

704
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,261
different planets,
it talks about your readiness and it 

705
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:46,261
talks about Neptune,
you know,

706
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:51,241
it talks about the creation of earth.
They have the exact same theory that we 

707
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:55,030
have as far as the creation of the moon.
The theory is that Earth one,

708
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,160
there was an earth,
it was like billions of years ago,

709
00:28:57,161 --> 00:28:59,350
it got hit with a planet and created the
moon.

710
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:04,351
And now we are earth to post impact.
Now this is something that scientists 

711
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:06,400
had just recently embraced over the past
few decades,

712
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,210
but sitch and wrote about this shit way 
back in the seventies.

713
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:10,990
I mean,
this was,

714
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:13,390
this was at the Sumerian said,
you know,

715
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,020
the guy,
if you watch his,

716
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,310
his documentaries and you listen to such
and talk and get his shit online,

717
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,580
it is fucking fascinating.
You know,

718
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:23,050
and I'm not saying that,
you know,

719
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:26,470
some aliens made us as you know,
as a race of slaves.

720
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:31,530
But I am saying that the world is so 
crazy as it is the,

721
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,040
the fact that we could send photographs 
to people and you can get video,

722
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:41,041
download it from your phone and you can 
basically answer any question that 

723
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:41,041
immediately by pressing,
you know,

724
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,040
google or are they

725
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,920
the Google thing where you know,
you talk into it and you say,

726
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,010
you know,
what year did Columbus sail,

727
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:50,020
blah blah blah,
and it'll give you the information.

728
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,090
Like instantly this has never happened 
before.

729
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:57,091
Man,
there's this crazy shit and it's only 

730
00:29:57,091 --> 00:29:57,400
gonna get crazier now.
If we live a 100,000

731
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:00,250
years longer and stayed alive and 
managed to keep evolving,

732
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,290
for sure,
we would get to the point,

733
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:07,291
would be able to travel to other planets
and find other species that we thought 

734
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:12,571
weren't advanced enough and fuck with 
them if we decided a certain point in 

735
00:30:12,571 --> 00:30:13,450
time with all this investigation that 
we're doing into live,

736
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,600
like what they're doing right now with 
synthetic cells where they are creating 

737
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:18,670
cells,
creating cells,

738
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:20,350
and eventually creating living 
organisms.

739
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:25,351
This is all really going to happen.
If we get to the point where we realize 

740
00:30:25,351 --> 00:30:28,571
that life itself is just a code that we 
can manipulate and change to our will,

741
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,100
well when that happens,
man,

742
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:35,101
you're not going to think anything's 
wrong with taking some monkeys and 

743
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,400
making them smarter and having them work
for you,

744
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,430
you know,
and if there's a super intelligent being

745
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,080
or,
or,

746
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:45,081
or race of beings that's thousands of 
years advanced from us or millions or 

747
00:30:45,081 --> 00:30:46,780
perhaps even a billion,
you know,

748
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:51,850
what if they live in a protected solar 
system where they don't have to worry 

749
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:51,850
about asteroids,
what if the asteroid impact is,

750
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,960
is not a common thing would if,
you know,

751
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,680
all this shit that happens in our solar 
system is kind of rare.

752
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,200
And in other solar systems,
they don't have media problems.

753
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,430
I mean,
if that's the case,

754
00:31:00,431 --> 00:31:02,890
if that's true,
they could be a billion years older than

755
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:04,240
us.
We don't fucking know.

756
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,220
We have no idea.
Yeah.

757
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:10,221
Uh,
basically switching was one of very few 

758
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:10,221
people,
again,

759
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:14,671
that transcribed over 20,000
tablets and these tablets were all like 

760
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:20,090
in detailed descriptions of how they can
down the names of the rulers.

761
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:25,951
And the South American ones,
they real technical shit about how it 

762
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:30,060
all went down.
He transcribed all that shit in the 

763
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,720
seventies and uh,
and he put all this information out,

764
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,290
all this information that he wasn't,
he's saying that he wasn't making it up.

765
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,120
He was just transcribing all these 
stories and people are,

766
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,610
or a lot of people,
you know,

767
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,110
his daughters were like,
well,

768
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,520
he's full of Shit.
How could he know this?

769
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:43,240
And how could he know that?

770
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,430
But the few things that he did know in 
the seventies that,

771
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:47,260
uh,
we were just figuring out now,

772
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:52,380
one in his transcriptions,
he talked about how the Sumerians knew 

773
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,401
that Uranus and Neptune were both water 
twins and we just found that out in the 

774
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,840
eighties that they actually are water 
twins.

775
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:00,820
That was new.
How the hell did such a know this?

776
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:06,090
Another thing is such.
And the basis of the story is aliens 

777
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,140
need our acumen.
They look just like us.

778
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:10,420
They're just,
they're supposedly.

779
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,380
And uh,
we'll,

780
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:11,840
we'll,
uh,

781
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,920
maybe taller or whatever.
But are they way better looking than 

782
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,520
they need our gold to ces to turn into 
gold dust,

783
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,390
to suspend in their atmosphere,
to protect their atmosphere.

784
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,580
That's what they need.
He's talking to them from radiation.

785
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:25,990
Yes.
That's what he's talking about.

786
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:27,570
And the seventies and the 
transcriptions,

787
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,690
he's not an astrophysicist.
We just found out like in 2001,

788
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:34,900
2002 that that's exactly how you protect
atmospheres.

789
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:39,320
You take metallic particles and you 
suspend them in the atmosphere to,

790
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,930
you know,
either keep radiation and or out.

791
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,320
We just figured that out.
How the hell did this guy figure out 

792
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,320
through the.
And he's saying,

793
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,810
well,
he didn't know he transcribed.

794
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,260
He,
he did.

795
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,160
He just guessed that that's the way we 
protect atmospheres.

796
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,350
He already talked about that.
There's a lot of.

797
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,590
I mean,
he gets into details a lot of shit that 

798
00:32:59,590 --> 00:32:59,590
makes it like home.
Wow.

799
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,290
There's a lot.
There's a lot to.

800
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,750
It sounds crazy and we don't have all 
day to talk about it,

801
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:05,540
but have an open mind.
It's fascinating stuff.

802
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:07,550
I thought it was towed to the thinking.

803
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,700
There's a,
there's a bunch of debate about this 

804
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:12,700
planet Nibiru and there's a guy who's 
got a website called [inaudible].

805
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,220
Sitchin is wrong and his website is 
stitching is wrong.com,

806
00:33:16,221 --> 00:33:18,500
and this guy does not believed that 
there was,

807
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:22,910
that there's this planet Nibiru and he 
has the quotes to tax.

808
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,490
It's really involved and I haven't 
really looked into it.

809
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,770
I don't know who the fuck is right and 
who's wrong.

810
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,400
I really don't,
but I do know that the,

811
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,540
just all the shit that came out of that 
one area is really fascinating and when 

812
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,731
you find out that one part of the world 
is responsible for the first 

813
00:33:39,731 --> 00:33:39,731
mathematics,
the first astronomy,

814
00:33:39,731 --> 00:33:41,720
first astrology,
first written language first,

815
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:44,990
use the wheel first.
Everything first agriculture was Iraq.

816
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,430
It's Iraq because Iraq.
Yeah.

817
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,140
Crazy fucking nuts.

818
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,000
First organized.
Well,

819
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:58,050
that's why they're so fucked up.
That's why I've always said that that 

820
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,701
part of the world,
the reason why there are laws are so 

821
00:34:00,701 --> 00:34:00,701
archaic.
They're like the townies of the world.

822
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:05,770
Those are the people that were there 
when civilization was created and 

823
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,800
they're still rock.
They're still rocking that ancient law.

824
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,790
You know,
you dance,

825
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:10,130
we throw rocks at you,
you fuck someone from the other tribe,

826
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,140
we throw rocks at you,
you show your ankles,

827
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:13,550
we throw rocks at you.
Why is.

828
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,580
Why is an agent that's smart though have
now has not progressed like they 

829
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,270
stopped.
Everybody moved out to California,

830
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,530
left like,
what is California?

831
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:24,770
California is the group of people that 
landed somewhere else new.

832
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:29,771
It sucked and move to the best box.
Eventually you figure out that the best 

833
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:29,870
Bot of southern California,
you're figuring out,

834
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:34,871
wait a minute,
there's a spot where it never gets so 

835
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:36,140
cold that it's knows okay.
There's no hurricanes.

836
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,840
You have to worry about earthquakes 
every now and then,

837
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,230
but there's no lightning as worst 
traffic in the rural.

838
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,240
It was the worst traffic in the world,
but like as far as rules that climate 

839
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:47,510
has nothing.
It has nothing to do with climate.

840
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,820
Yeah.
It's like the climate here is the reason

841
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,520
why everybody flocks to this place.
It's way easier to live here.

842
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,890
No,
that is true.

843
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,820
It's like a club promoters.
When a club in La,

844
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,030
when a club rises and falls,
the club promoters don't die with the 

845
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:07,171
club.
They just find a new location and they 

846
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:07,171
just keep moving the original club with 
some area.

847
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,470
It was blowing up,
it was going off.

848
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,960
Then it closed down,
the promoters moved to Egypt,

849
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,480
they blew that up for awhile.
That shit close down.

850
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:16,290
People got tired of Egypt,
then they blew it up in Israel that have

851
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,550
change all the names and in all their 
uh,

852
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,960
um,
uh,

853
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:25,090
their stories of creation.
Then it went to Rome and then it split 

854
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,680
off and then it ended up in England and 
Germany and the united.

855
00:35:26,681 --> 00:35:27,420
It's totally okay.
That makes

856
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,420
sense of that part of the world is 
backwards because it's just like going 

857
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,420
back home.
I mean,

858
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,480
that's what I'm talking about.
It's like going back home,

859
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:34,580
if I went back home to Boston and hung 
out,

860
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:35,870
I would think like,
God,

861
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:38,260
like the dudes I went high school with 
like two,

862
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,360
you're,
you're still living in this fucking this

863
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,240
crazy land.
Like why didn't you escape?

864
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,990
And that's like what it's like in air.
It's like Sumir,

865
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,020
you know,
it became Iraq and everybody eventually 

866
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,341
moved on to other places of the world,
people who weren't satisfied with where 

867
00:35:52,341 --> 00:35:55,641
they were and how life was,
if that's where all human beings 

868
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:55,710
supposedly came from,
everybody who left as a people that were

869
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:58,410
trying to find something better.
It kind of makes sense.

870
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,940
It kind of makes sense that if 
everybody,

871
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:04,950
if that really is the cradle of 
civilization and everybody left from 

872
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:04,950
there and trying to find something 
better,

873
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:09,290
of course the people that are remained 
suck just totally make sense.

874
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,040
Dom didn't suck.
How dare you,

875
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,850
how dare you,

876
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,840
how dare you.
How dare everybody listening to this at 

877
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,980
this point in time stolen.
Motherfucker get him to the Greek.

878
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:22,570
Eddie,
did you like it?

879
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:24,070
I loved it.
I love.

880
00:36:24,071 --> 00:36:25,720
What would you rate it as?
Five stars?

881
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,530
Not quite as good as hangover,
but right under hangover,

882
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,520
like,
like,

883
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,800
uh,
it was,

884
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,050
I thought it was really good,
man.

885
00:36:35,051 --> 00:36:36,910
I laughed out loud.
At least 10.

886
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,710
There was a good 10 times where I was 
like,

887
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,330
aw,
they killed it.

888
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,800
That dude,
the main dude,

889
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:43,630
the fat guy,
he's awesome.

890
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,520
I love that guy.
He is pretty good.

891
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:51,510
That guy is bad.
He's funny and every they must let him 

892
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,111
go off because it's not a coincidence 
that he always has great lines and you 

893
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:59,131
know,
who impressed me fucking p diddy is 

894
00:36:59,131 --> 00:36:59,890
acting was like 80 percent on.
It wasn't,

895
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,920
but it was way better than fifty cents.
It was an academy award winning 

896
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,040
performance.
But he pulled it off and he made me 

897
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,961
laugh too.
There's an argument with that one rnb 

898
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:10,210
singer member with the pink shirt.
What's that guy's name?

899
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,400
That was hilarious,
dude.

900
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:14,620
That was funny dude.
It was so funny that putting it in,

901
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,740
putting it in the previews now that's 
part of the pre.

902
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,870
So don't,
don't give any spoilers away.

903
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,730
But uh,
I love that Russell brand go to diddy 

904
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,680
was the probably the best part about 
that movie though.

905
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,310
He was good and I posted that on my 
twitter.

906
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:31,530
That was one of the worst movies I've 
ever seen in my life.

907
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,180
It was so ridiculous.

908
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,230
You can splice.
No,

909
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,200
you could tell.
She didn't think I could tell.

910
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:37,160
I thought that made me look bad.

911
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,200
Bad Ass.
I was so looking forward to that movie,

912
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,080
I was like,

913
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,970
did it die?
A horrible death at the box office.

914
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,750
It actually didn't do that good.
I wasn't in the top.

915
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,230
It got 70 something percent on rotten 
tomatoes.

916
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,090
But listen how crazy this movie is.
Okay.

917
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,910
This guy has his girlfriend,
they're both scientists.

918
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:58,030
They're doing all these experiments with
human DNA and they figured out how to 

919
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,800
synthesize human DNA with a animal DNA.
I phenols lizards or some shit.

920
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:02,360
I don't know what the fuck I spliced it 
with.

921
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,580
So uh,
they just wanted to see if they could do

922
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:05,180
it.
So they.

923
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,300
So she closes the door and does it,
you know,

924
00:38:08,301 --> 00:38:08,800
like,
like.

925
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,750
So he like,
he can't stop her and he runs in and she

926
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:16,751
presses the button.
It's like really ridiculous and she 

927
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:17,900
makes this half human being half animal 
lizard fucking thing.

928
00:38:17,901 --> 00:38:19,610
Whatever the fuck it was.
It's the source.

929
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:22,580
So goofy.
So they raised this is,

930
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,110
this is a person.
Yeah.

931
00:38:24,111 --> 00:38:25,580
All spoiler.
Like a motherfucker

932
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,070
plug your ears.
Yeah,

933
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:28,810
I'm still gonna.
See it.

934
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:29,950
You're you to see this.
Okay.

935
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,600
Because I have a feeling that I'm going 
to like it because I've,

936
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:34,760
I've read,
I've actually,

937
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,160
because after you made me not see

938
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,900
it,
and then so then I kind of got angry and

939
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,540
then I said I was talking to him with 
some friends of mine and they said,

940
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,710
dude,
what is he talking about?

941
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:43,450
That movie was fucking awesome.
Oh my God.

942
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,280
You like Nacho Libre?
And we walked out.

943
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:45,790
No,
no,

944
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,190
no,
no,

945
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:46,500
no,
no.

946
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,770
That's a libra was just you guys walking
now.

947
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:53,440
So dumb in three minutes.
No you don't.

948
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:54,900
No,
you don't know how dumb this will.

949
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,530
This movie makes Nacho libra looked like
it was awful,

950
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,740
but you guys only gave me like three or 
five minutes or something like you're 

951
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:04,740
like,
was bad,

952
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,970
was offensive.
It was hurting my hand.

953
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,700
There's no way.
There's no way they had.

954
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:12,850
They had like 20.
I gave him 20 attempts at jokes to 

955
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,150
people in the front lap and I'm like,
damn,

956
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:18,151
these are their drugs.
Like if you're waiting this long to 

957
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:18,160
throw in some funny shit,
there's no way that ending's going to be

958
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:18,460
good

959
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,780
black fan.
I think he's hilarious.

960
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:22,850
I love his movies.
I love that rock and roll high.

961
00:39:22,851 --> 00:39:25,370
Whatever the fuck it was rock school.
That was good.

962
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:27,710
It was really good and he was excellent 
in tropic thunder.

963
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,890
Green that King Kong.
I haven't seen tropic.

964
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,940
Still haven't seen tropic thunder.
It's one of my,

965
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,520
that's for sure.
Hangover.

966
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,590
Tropic thunder is a for sure.
Hang on.

967
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,350
Okay,
I'll see it.

968
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,820
I keep fucking putting it off.
But um,

969
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,460
yeah,
I mean that movie was whatever this,

970
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:45,770
the splice is way worse.
Just the splice.

971
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,940
Pluggers bitch.
I will see it by this.

972
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,190
This is how crazy it is.
They make this thing okay.

973
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,920
Grows really quick.
Okay.

974
00:39:51,921 --> 00:39:56,921
And all of a sudden it's from a baby.
It grows like almost instantly to a 

975
00:39:56,921 --> 00:40:00,041
grown woman.
So they have this grown woman alien 

976
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:00,041
thing and they don't know where to keep 
her.

977
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:00,620
So they keep her in a storage room.
They're like,

978
00:40:00,621 --> 00:40:05,621
nobody goes down there.
So they set up a bedroom in the fucking 

979
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:06,920
storage place where they work and the 
fucking alien.

980
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:11,921
They're okay.
The thing's only been alive for like a 

981
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:11,921
couple months and then Adrian Brody 
fucks it.

982
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,650
No,
now I got to see it,

983
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,040
so fucking not only is it an alien,
like we'll crazy.

984
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,990
It's got a tail,
a fucked up legs and everything,

985
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,640
but it's also three months old.
He's fucking this thing.

986
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,130
It's three months.
Her body,

987
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,880
she's got tits and she's kind of like 
sexy looking.

988
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,770
It's like they took a sexy chicken.
Just did some CGI on her.

989
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,510
Wow.
Yeah.

990
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:38,210
She escaped and eats a rabbit.
She escapes and she can fly.

991
00:40:38,211 --> 00:40:39,440
She's got wings.
She flies.

992
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,960
She lands in Eatsa fucking rabbit and 
then not even freaking out.

993
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:42,920
They're like,
why are you doing that?

994
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:43,790
Don't do that.
Stop.

995
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,570
It's ridiculous.
It's so bad.

996
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:48,800
I'm going to see it.
I'm going to see it.

997
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,610
That sounds good,
Brian.

998
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,600
So you know why you know why he did.
He has to go see it.

999
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,680
Yeah.
It has to be.

1000
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,330
I'm not hurting it.
Let me tell you something.

1001
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:59,090
Don't you wish that this movie is so 
goddamn bad?

1002
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:04,270
I think it might turn into one of those 
movies that's like a cult hit because 

1003
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:04,490
it's so bad.
People are going to go see it

1004
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,260
again.
I.

1005
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:10,270
This is what I did hear about it.
I heard that there was actually 

1006
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:10,270
personally that we're supposed to be 
funny now.

1007
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,990
It has nothing to do with it.
Like a humor to where I try to be funny 

1008
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,551
if they were there,
they said it in an interview that a lot 

1009
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:18,551
of people aren't getting the humor of 
the movie.

1010
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:19,580
Oh my God.
You mean the whole movie,

1011
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,040
the whole movie.
It's like,

1012
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:28,070
are you sure that you weren't baked and 
you didn't get like the humor like 

1013
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:28,070
serious or something?
I wasn't big at all.

1014
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,600
In your defense,
Brian,

1015
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,980
I think he might like it because you're 
like crazy shit like that.

1016
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Nobody liked him.
If you go in wanting to see something 

1017
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,120
ridiculous,
you're going to like it,

1018
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,730
but if you go in thinking you're going 
to get the shit scared out of you.

1019
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:45,731
Like some new alien movie.
That's what I thought it was going to 

1020
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:45,731
be.
When I saw like it was just like she was

1021
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:49,901
threatening the in in the previews looks
like she's threatening one of the 

1022
00:41:49,901 --> 00:41:49,901
scientists.
I'm like,

1023
00:41:49,901 --> 00:41:53,861
oh,
they create something and it's fucking 

1024
00:41:53,861 --> 00:41:53,861
crazy and it gets out of control and 
it's scary.

1025
00:41:53,861 --> 00:41:54,980
I'm to see it this week and I can't wait
to discuss it.

1026
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,040
I can't wait to discuss it with you.
I might bring a bag of rocks thrown at 

1027
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:03,280
you because there has been.
There has been movies that,

1028
00:42:03,281 --> 00:42:04,910
that,
that we totally disagree.

1029
00:42:04,911 --> 00:42:07,510
It's kind of funny how people get upset 
when someone likes something.

1030
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,130
They don't like iphones yet.

1031
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:14,130
Like anything.
What about my group or did you like the 

1032
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:14,130
group or.
But I,

1033
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:18,760
when I first saw the preview,
I thought it looked like the dumbest 

1034
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,450
fucking movie I've ever seen in my life 
and I heard his awesome dog shit.

1035
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,510
I heard it was awesome.
No,

1036
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:25,511
I heard of dogs really like group.
I haven't heard a thing I haven't heard 

1037
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:25,511
of.
It was stupid on snl.

1038
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,760
How the hell did they make a movie?
Review looks retarded and SNL is like 

1039
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,081
one of those things.
It's really been kept alive because of 

1040
00:42:35,081 --> 00:42:35,081
youtube clips.
You know,

1041
00:42:35,081 --> 00:42:37,730
when a good snl sketch gets on youtube 
and makes you want to watch snl again?

1042
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:40,850
It was,
I would have no notice are kept alive by

1043
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,710
Andy Sandler,
whatever his name is,

1044
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,340
who's at the young guy that makes all 
those skits like on a boat and stuff.

1045
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:47,300
That dude's hilarious.

1046
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,560
Oh,
is he the one that's.

1047
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,900
I've never seen that sketch,
but I heard that song.

1048
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:51,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

1049
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:51,950
He's,
he's.

1050
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,980
He does all these like little skits on 
Saturday night live and it makes the 

1051
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,620
show in my opinion that in that one main
girl on there.

1052
00:42:57,621 --> 00:42:58,600
That's hilarious.
Dude.

1053
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,880
I haven't watched that live in years.
I haven't watched it in so long.

1054
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,240
A good monologue on youtube or something
like that.

1055
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,730
There's just certain shows that after 
awhile I'm like,

1056
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,050
that's it.
Done.

1057
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,760
I can't.
I can't keep coming back to that.

1058
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:11,930
Well,
you know,

1059
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:14,360
you fucked me too many times.
Andy Sanberg.

1060
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,850
That's why I got into.
Just got into true blood.

1061
00:43:16,851 --> 00:43:18,760
You guys.
Oh No.

1062
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:23,830
I watched half an episode and I was just
silliness to watch it from the first 

1063
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:28,241
time I've watched.
I've won so goddamn tired of vampires 

1064
00:43:28,241 --> 00:43:30,320
don't eat people kind of nonsense 
people.

1065
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:31,880
Barely.
Well,

1066
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:33,470
they got to do,
you know the premise of it?

1067
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:38,471
Yeah.
They have some fake blood that they use 

1068
00:43:38,471 --> 00:43:39,630
and they finally came out.
Vampires or it's like,

1069
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:40,570
you know,
it's like,

1070
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:45,610
why do you like that show?
I did get bored.

1071
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,250
I like,
that's like mixing vampires with Gilmore

1072
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:52,490
girls.
That's the worst shit ever.

1073
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:54,110
Man.
That's so gay.

1074
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:56,240
I only watched someone.
You got to see if I've seen.

1075
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,150
I've seen the first whatever season,
two seasons or whatever,

1076
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,260
two seasons and stop after five.
There's been many shows where I've 

1077
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,220
watched because of my girlfriend,
so that's one of them,

1078
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:15,690
that bandwidth to see sex and the city 
to 50 times better than that show.

1079
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:17,930
But no,
that show to me was just,

1080
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:18,890
I can't,
I couldn't even.

1081
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,040
I was amazed that people like that show.
I thought I liked the purpose.

1082
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,660
I like it a texture and the other guy,
I never watched that show.

1083
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:28,190
I watched dexter.
I never watched the show,

1084
00:44:28,191 --> 00:44:29,780
but I did watch half an episode and I 
was like,

1085
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:32,520
you know what?
I have just hit vampire overload.

1086
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,730
Too many fucking vampire shows.
Man.

1087
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:40,731
It's too silly.
There's too many different rules that 

1088
00:44:40,731 --> 00:44:40,731
people are making up for vampires now.
Like,

1089
00:44:40,731 --> 00:44:41,610
oh,
they can go on the light,

1090
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:43,710
but they just sparkle like,
fuck you,

1091
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:44,280
man.
No,

1092
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,290
there's some rules for vampires.
All right.

1093
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,630
The rule is if you're gonna,
drink people's blood.

1094
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,220
When the sun comes out,
you fucking die.

1095
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:51,330
Bitch.
You supposed to hide.

1096
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:54,030
You hide in the dark.
He can't be going to high school walking

1097
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:55,320
around with everybody because it's 
cloudy.

1098
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:57,360
That's retarded.
This is stupid.

1099
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,640
This is fucking.
You can't keep doing this.

1100
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,500
And it's like it's.
It's to me,

1101
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:06,501
it's a symptom of our culture.
All these vampire movies are a symptom 

1102
00:45:06,501 --> 00:45:07,980
of our culture.
We live in fact empires for real.

1103
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,110
The reason why people are so into this,
it's like when you,

1104
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,980
when,
when you look at like how infantiles our

1105
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:18,981
culture is,
we want to believe that you know that 

1106
00:45:18,981 --> 00:45:20,340
there is silly fake shit out there like,
like vampires.

1107
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,970
We believe so much retarded shit as far 
as just what the government feeds us.

1108
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:27,410
The news feeds us and with corporations 
feed us and you know our,

1109
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:32,411
our perceptions of how we have this 
world under control and everything's 

1110
00:45:32,411 --> 00:45:35,600
fine and no wars are just and all the 
crazy shit that we justify ourselves 

1111
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,930
doing.
If we can believe all that shit,

1112
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:38,450
you know,
why not fam powers?

1113
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,860
It's a fucking half a step away,
step away.

1114
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,920
Is there a movement or their websites 
about people that really have evidence 

1115
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:45,920
that vampires really.
There's people that.

1116
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,420
People who've committed murders because 
of that,

1117
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:53,220
because they believe they're vampires.
Totally.

1118
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,750
There's people that think they're 
werewolves.

1119
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,360
You know,
they take their fucking clothes.

1120
00:45:56,361 --> 00:45:56,980
Oh,
the yellow.

1121
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
There's,
there's people that shaped their teeth 

1122
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and fangs.
Eddie.

1123
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,740
There's people that shaved their teeth 
and fangs point in time.

1124
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:05,310
It's like,
yeah,

1125
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,880
okay,
look,

1126
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:07,860
the guy's not undead and yeah,
he's not.

1127
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:12,890
He's not going to live forever and he's 
not going to drink people's blood to 

1128
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,471
stay alive,
but people are crazy enough to think 

1129
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:19,071
that they are vampires.
Truly to truly believe it and actually 

1130
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:19,071
go out and murder somebody and drink 
their blood.

1131
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:19,470
People are that nuts,
man.

1132
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,760
What if that's real shit?
If you're a fucking complete and total 

1133
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,050
loser and you have nothing going on in 
your life,

1134
00:46:25,051 --> 00:46:30,051
your life is unbelievably bad and the 
only thing that's exciting is the 

1135
00:46:30,051 --> 00:46:32,700
thought of biting someone's neck and 
sucking their blood out and kill them.

1136
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,900
Do you guys look at that?
Buyers are have hockey blood and they.

1137
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,500
Did you hear about.
Did you guys hear about that case in 

1138
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,831
Texas?
I think it was 2006 slash six slash six 

1139
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:47,400
slash 2006 with a woman named her kids 
after Satan.

1140
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:52,401
Like they were named after like satanic 
names and then on that day she murdered 

1141
00:46:52,401 --> 00:46:54,210
them on and I drank their bladders.
Oh my God.

1142
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,300
Really?
I think it was 2006.

1143
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,780
Oh Man.
That Satan thing is the surest sign that

1144
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:03,660
you're fucking bananas if you believe in
Jesus.

1145
00:47:03,661 --> 00:47:05,280
That's one thing.
It seems like,

1146
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:10,540
you know,
I mean maybe there was a real person 

1147
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,860
that existed,
but all the magic things attributed to 

1148
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,021
him really.
And you're gonna believe that just 

1149
00:47:15,021 --> 00:47:15,021
because it was a long time ago.
That seems to be,

1150
00:47:15,021 --> 00:47:17,490
to me completely silly,
but it's acceptable.

1151
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,210
It's like,
okay,

1152
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:19,380
I understand where you're coming from.

1153
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,000
I understand that's what you believe.
I understand.

1154
00:47:21,001 --> 00:47:22,350
You know,
everybody has their own point of view,

1155
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:24,960
but when you start talking about 
devil's,

1156
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,710
you started talking about Satan like 
Jesus Christ.

1157
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,720
Really you think there's a fucking bad 
man who's pulling strings and tempting 

1158
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,760
you with pussy and cigarettes and you 
really,

1159
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:41,761
you think that's real.
That is a devil makes you make bad 

1160
00:47:41,761 --> 00:47:44,580
decisions and and it makes you rape and 
beat people up and you think the devil's

1161
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,510
doing that tempting.
You Die.

1162
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,680
That's so infantiles.
It's amazing that people even consider 

1163
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,281
it and we know that there's,
there's a part of us that knows that 

1164
00:47:56,281 --> 00:47:56,281
talking about the devils.
Ridiculous.

1165
00:47:56,281 --> 00:47:57,580
That's why you don't hear the president 
talking about it.

1166
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,530
The president will always talk about 
God.

1167
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,680
He'll never talk about the devil,
the president that may God bless our 

1168
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:04,680
troops.
You know,

1169
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,350
we believe that God is on our side.

1170
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,390
Like Bush said,
a bunch of Wacky God shit.

1171
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,500
Never once did he say,
we have found Satan and he's in Iraq.

1172
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,340
We know where Satan is.
What we're going to drill to the core of

1173
00:48:15,341 --> 00:48:19,570
the earth until we find tracks.
Say You met,

1174
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:24,571
you've met him at all.
You mentioned st at all and you're 

1175
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:24,610
fucking crazy.
You can say,

1176
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:29,611
you know,
we believe we have found the actual 

1177
00:48:29,611 --> 00:48:30,070
cross that Jesus was nailed on and 
people will go,

1178
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:31,120
wow,
holy shit.

1179
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,480
You can say,
we think we've found where Satan used to

1180
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:36,730
live.
They'll get the fuck outta here.

1181
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,540
You what?
Huh?

1182
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,650
You could actually say you can be an 
archeologist and you can say,

1183
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:44,560
we believe we found the cross that Jesus
was nailed on.

1184
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,680
But if you say,
we think we found the box where Satan 

1185
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:49,690
lived in,
people would go,

1186
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:52,360
shut the fuck up.
They wouldn't even talk to you.

1187
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,100
They wouldn't even take you serious for 
a second.

1188
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,150
There we go.
This is crazy.

1189
00:48:55,151 --> 00:48:57,010
Asshole thinks he found where the devil 
lives.

1190
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,730
Isn't that crazy?
Satan is a force.

1191
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:00,790
Dude.
It's not a person.

1192
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:02,140
It's not a real guy,
man.

1193
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:04,690
Isn't he a fallen angel?
I'm confused.

1194
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:10,180
I mean isn't he supposed to be.
He used to be cool and they touch a 

1195
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:10,180
shitty with God.

1196
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,920
I'm sorry for going off on true blood.
I'm on just on team Jacob and it kind of

1197
00:49:13,921 --> 00:49:14,320
gets to me

1198
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,750
brother.
It's all right man.

1199
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:16,620
Again,
Werewolf.

1200
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:18,420
So don't eat people.
That's another thing.

1201
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:21,060
We want our Goddamn cake and we want to 
eat it too.

1202
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:24,410
We want all the sexy and none of the 
murder were willful.

1203
00:49:24,411 --> 00:49:25,020
Stupid,
right?

1204
00:49:25,021 --> 00:49:27,090
Or Wolf or you know.
One of the wolf man was stupid,

1205
00:49:27,091 --> 00:49:30,930
but I bought it on DVD because I'm such 
a sucker for fucking horror movies.

1206
00:49:30,931 --> 00:49:34,170
That's how much I love horror movies by 
mediocre horror movies and watch them on

1207
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:39,171
DVD fighting it.
They put it on the background while I 

1208
00:49:39,171 --> 00:49:39,171
was writing nightmare on elm street.
The new one.

1209
00:49:39,171 --> 00:49:39,171
Did he it?
No,

1210
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,200
no.
Brian.

1211
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:43,140
Now like that actor though.
That's that dude from the watchman.

1212
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,880
He's a the new Freddy Kruger.
The dude who played a roar shark,

1213
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,760
but why?
What's wrong with the old Freddy Krueger

1214
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,990
Dan?
You got an.

1215
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:54,940
You've got an actor just to look like 
Freddy Kruger.

1216
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,500
That's one character you can play until 
he is 98 because the older he isn't real

1217
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:03,310
life cut out the old freddy when he was 
the shit.

1218
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:08,340
There was no one.
The problem is he became a joke or 

1219
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:08,620
money.
You want it too much money.

1220
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:13,650
Maybe because I mean seriously,
the new guys just had makeup on to look 

1221
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:13,650
like the old guy,
you know,

1222
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:14,440
so there's not really any reason other 
than that.

1223
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,320
He looked a little different.
Yeah,

1224
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,180
it looked a little creepier.
I saw some pictures of it online.

1225
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:21,160
I didn't see the movie,
but it looks a little new guys.

1226
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:23,100
Is he young?
He said No.

1227
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,440
Well he's a little younger player 
himself.

1228
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,290
Was this like a preschool like they 
showed?

1229
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:27,690
No,
no,

1230
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:28,010
I didn't

1231
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,890
see it as that may have been tasked with
Robert England in [inaudible] 75.

1232
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,590
I thought it was just a Redo.
I just thought it just rebooted it.

1233
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,800
Maybe it is Robert England.
Is he in bad shape now?

1234
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:42,801
I mean,
I think I saw on the news he was upset 

1235
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:42,801
about it was like,
why didn't you just.

1236
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:42,801
You're saying,
well,

1237
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:44,960
when you try to reboot something,
you want to do a different actor.

1238
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,970
I mean how many goddamn times they got 
to do the hawk,

1239
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,440
you know,
they did the Eric Bana One and they 

1240
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:52,440
liked.
What about,

1241
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,240
what about Captain America?
Why aren't they doing it again?

1242
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:54,680
Or they're trying it again or I don't 
know.

1243
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,620
I know they did one back like what?
Ten years ago.

1244
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:03,050
We're just one though because they did 
it like a couple of years after the old 

1245
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:03,140
one.
The Eric Bana came out and then like two

1246
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:05,860
or three years later,
the fucking Edward Norton one came out.

1247
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:10,890
When is wonder woman coming up to play 
wonder woman for Scarlett Johansson too?

1248
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,500
She's got some big titties though.
She's got it.

1249
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,550
She's built like wonder woman.
She's got that wonder ass.

1250
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,830
Just am a woman.
Got to be tall.

1251
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,450
Yeah,
but you can make a tall.

1252
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:24,950
Just put her with a bunch of short 
people.

1253
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:30,130
You put up with a bunch of short people 
and you give her high heels and that's 

1254
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:30,130
how Tom Cruise rocks in his movies.
You know,

1255
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,990
you just give a little lift and put them
around people that are installing them.

1256
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:35,810
I wonder what the tallest guy has to 
start with.

1257
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:38,870
Tom Cruise.
Probably Brad Pitt talked about how they

1258
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:43,871
had scenes where he.
Tom Cruise had to like stand on planks 

1259
00:51:43,871 --> 00:51:45,140
and shit.
Really try to make them appear to be the

1260
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:50,141
same height pit.
Let's throwing them under the fucking 

1261
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:52,661
throwing them under the bus,
but they were talking about it in the 

1262
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:52,661
interview and Brad Pitt was confirming 
it.

1263
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:53,630
What about advantage Lily Lily doing 
that?

1264
00:51:53,631 --> 00:51:54,740
Make that up.
I might have made that up.

1265
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:57,770
Wonder woman,
the girl from last kate from last.

1266
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,360
That'd be hot wonder woman.
Yeah,

1267
00:51:59,361 --> 00:52:00,260
she's pretty hot.
Yeah,

1268
00:52:00,261 --> 00:52:05,261
that would work.
Megan Fox got to be wonder woman for 

1269
00:52:05,261 --> 00:52:05,261
sure.
That no one.

1270
00:52:05,261 --> 00:52:06,710
No one would question.
It was interesting.

1271
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:10,400
An interesting conversation I read with 
Brad Pitt talking about Tom Cruise,

1272
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,590
about working on that movie together and
something about.

1273
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:13,630
Yeah,
yeah.

1274
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:18,670
Interview with the vampire is saying 
that he wished that something that he 

1275
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,791
wished Tom Cruise wasn't so competitive.
Something that you wished they could be 

1276
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:22,790
better friends with.
Tom Cruise was a more competitive,

1277
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:25,190
I wish I remember the quote,
I hope I'm quoting it correctly,

1278
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,840
but uh,
that's fascinating,

1279
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:31,841
you know,
for sure because Brad Pitt was just 

1280
00:52:31,841 --> 00:52:31,841
coming up.
That was the new guy just coming and Tom

1281
00:52:31,841 --> 00:52:32,720
Cruise,
like he,

1282
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,920
you know,
he um,

1283
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,000
a campaign for that role,
you know,

1284
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:37,790
he wanted that role.

1285
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,860
A lot of people did not want him to play
that vampire,

1286
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:40,640
you know,
like the,

1287
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:45,641
and the,
and rice people didn't take him 

1288
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:45,641
seriously because her work was so 
serious.

1289
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:47,630
It was such good writing.
And they thought Tom Cruise's,

1290
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,360
cheeseball actor who did top gun,
all these stupid movies,

1291
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,790
you know,
like this guy can't play lists.like

1292
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:54,440
this,
like really intense vampire.

1293
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:58,280
But goddamn that little free connect.
He pulled that shit off strong man.

1294
00:52:58,281 --> 00:52:59,660
How good was that?
A great movie.

1295
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,960
One of the greatest Goddamn vampire 
movie son.

1296
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,850
That's the real shit,
you know?

1297
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:05,470
I mean,
that's,

1298
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,320
those are scary monsters trapped in a 
person's body.

1299
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,740
They're a person,
you know their,

1300
00:53:10,741 --> 00:53:15,741
their,
their soul is trapped in this scary 

1301
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:15,741
monsters bought and it needs to eat 
people.

1302
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:17,960
That's that movie was bad ass.
The little girl.

1303
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:21,080
Kristen dunst.
How fucking creepy was she?

1304
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:25,100
That little chicken act man in the lost 
boys.

1305
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:25,860
Dude.

1306
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:30,380
C'Mon Bram stroker's was the past.
Come up with a good one,

1307
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:31,210
man.
Gary Oldman,

1308
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,410
the motherfucker crushes.
He's the motherfucker dude.

1309
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,180
He's that guy.
He's the best.

1310
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,600
I think he,
he gets into roles more than anybody.

1311
00:53:39,601 --> 00:53:44,601
Does he like transforms like that when 
we played that fucking drug dealer and 

1312
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:45,680
true romance.
Oh good.

1313
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,470
Was that shit?
Fuck yeah.

1314
00:53:47,471 --> 00:53:49,980
That movie was the ghetto white guy.
Yeah.

1315
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

1316
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,030
To do with the dreadlocks.
Have you been following Gary Coleman?

1317
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:55,410
Shit around lately.
I've been.

1318
00:53:55,530 --> 00:54:00,530
I've heard Anthony from opie and anthony
say that he thought that Gary's wife 

1319
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:00,530
killed them.

1320
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:05,420
Well,
she was trying to sell photos of him 

1321
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,090
laying in bed uh,
minutes before he died to tmz.

1322
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,090
Did you?
That got photos and she sold them.

1323
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,880
Somebody bought them,
but she was shopping around.

1324
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,800
She took a bunch of photos of him in 
bed.

1325
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:18,830
Like,
I guess I'll fucked up right before she 

1326
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:21,081
died.
The nurses and doctors all solid and 

1327
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:23,631
then she shopped around the photos and 
somebody just bought him I guess today 

1328
00:54:23,631 --> 00:54:23,810
or yesterday.
How fucked up is that?

1329
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,840
Oh my God.
He must have had a real attorney deck.

1330
00:54:26,841 --> 00:54:29,010
Huh?
Sometimes short guys.

1331
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,830
It's like mini me sometimes.
Short guys have big ass Dick.

1332
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:34,670
So it balances itself filed,
but he probably was short.

1333
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,280
It doesn't,
it,

1334
00:54:35,281 --> 00:54:37,150
it didn't matter.
Even if he had a big Dick,

1335
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:37,710
he's,
he,

1336
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,060
you know,
he's just got it helped.

1337
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,400
It would have helped the troyer is 
hanging in there.

1338
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:44,840
He's partying.
Oh,

1339
00:54:44,841 --> 00:54:48,080
that guy's depressed.
As celebrity rehab show.

1340
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,090
That was horrendous.
Celebrity Rehab.

1341
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:56,090
Troy,
who was the biggest disaster of all 

1342
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:56,090
time.
Not bigger than Tom size.

1343
00:54:56,090 --> 00:55:00,430
Oh my God dude.
Because I only saw last season that is 

1344
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:00,650
the best show on TV,
celebrity rehab,

1345
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:05,300
but I haven't seen anything from troy 
was like pissing in his room.

1346
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,000
Like what did,
he was crawling and celebrity rehab.

1347
00:55:08,001 --> 00:55:09,420
What was it that was,
um,

1348
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,770
that was uh,
the one with the,

1349
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,520
uh,
the time is a guy,

1350
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:13,730
right?

1351
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:18,730
Like all the,
all the level of celebrity celebrity 

1352
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:21,590
house or someone's going to talk about 
it.

1353
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,050
It wasn't celebrity rehab.
I saw what you're talking about.

1354
00:55:24,051 --> 00:55:24,420
Yeah,
yeah,

1355
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,590
yeah.
He was pissing all over himself.

1356
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,960
He's on this little buggy driving around
a little buggy.

1357
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,660
Anyway,
the point is,

1358
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,720
I don't think that guys that happy.
I think he's a mess.

1359
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,420
Thank God we have webster.
I follow him on twitter.

1360
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:39,530
I follow.
I'm going to follow him today.

1361
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,930
What is it?
Something like that.

1362
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:46,070
It's surreal life.
Thank you everybody there.

1363
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,020
Yet@twitter.com,
backslash tiny poop,

1364
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:49,880
I think.
Yeah,

1365
00:55:49,881 --> 00:55:50,850
man.
I think that's,

1366
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,090
that's gotta be one of the greatest 
tortures in life.

1367
00:55:53,091 --> 00:55:58,091
To be deformed.
Trying to make fun of your deformity to 

1368
00:55:58,091 --> 00:55:58,091
make a living.
You know,

1369
00:55:58,091 --> 00:55:59,930
but think about that most.
Most people,

1370
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:01,940
you look at someone with no arms,
no legs,

1371
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,250
and really like our first instinct is 
like,

1372
00:56:04,251 --> 00:56:06,080
damn,
he's never going to be truly loved.

1373
00:56:06,081 --> 00:56:08,060
He's not going to be desired.
Like Q.

1374
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,040
Imagine being this person who is not 
desired.

1375
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:11,530
No one wants to sexually,
you know,

1376
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:15,320
but really when we're all eventually 
going to be there because like,

1377
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:20,500
like I'm sure a hot 22 year old 
supermodel would rather fuck a gray 

1378
00:56:20,571 --> 00:56:21,590
maynard.
Not Gray maynard.

1379
00:56:21,591 --> 00:56:23,390
What's his name?
Uh,

1380
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,070
what's that?
The guy

1381
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:25,240
with no arms,
no legs.

1382
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:25,920
Oh,
Kyle.

1383
00:56:25,921 --> 00:56:26,950
Kyle.
Kyle maynard.

1384
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:30,160
Some 90 year old man.
You know what I mean?

1385
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,290
We're all good at.
We're eventually going to get there.

1386
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:37,291
We're going to be just so it's how much 
people want to fuck you is the quality 

1387
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:37,900
of your life,
but that,

1388
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:43,200
that's the instinct.
That's when you look at someone who's 

1389
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:43,200
deformed or like,
oh my God,

1390
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,561
no one's ever going to love them because
girls are programmed to stay away 

1391
00:56:46,561 --> 00:56:47,770
sexually.
Generally for burn victims.

1392
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:50,350
People who are amputees,
we all are.

1393
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,040
Cripples.
Yeah.

1394
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:54,250
We are the natural things that when we 
look at someone who's in a wheelchair,

1395
00:56:54,251 --> 00:56:55,090
we think,
fuck,

1396
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:58,090
that sucks.
He's so young and he's fucked,

1397
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:00,970
but eventually we're going to get there.
They just got it in advance.

1398
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,630
We're all going to walk through that 
fire unless we die early,

1399
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,930
but we're all going to be just as 
desired as that person,

1400
00:57:07,931 --> 00:57:10,210
so it's something to think about.
It's like really?

1401
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:11,530
What's life all about?
You got to,

1402
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,800
we're all going to end up living half 
our lives at least where no one wants to

1403
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:16,290
fuck up.
How are you?

1404
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,530
How are you going to handle things?

1405
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,290
Bigger issue is that they don't have 
freedom.

1406
00:57:21,291 --> 00:57:24,860
They're locked in a trap of a body and 
they never get to be a normal person.

1407
00:57:24,861 --> 00:57:26,690
They're surrounded by other people that 
are normal.

1408
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,180
That's the torture man.
It's not just whether or not people want

1409
00:57:29,181 --> 00:57:29,660
to fuck them.

1410
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,350
Yeah,
but Eddie isn't in that like you're.

1411
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:32,450
You're going to get.
It's hot in here.

1412
00:57:32,451 --> 00:57:34,170
If you're going to get married though,
you're again,

1413
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,080
50 percent of that time,
you're going to be with somebody.

1414
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:38,900
Maybe that doesn't want to be desired by
most people either,

1415
00:57:38,901 --> 00:57:40,970
but you both are undesirable together.
I do.

1416
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,970
You know,
you go 20 years without having sex.

1417
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,170
Twenty years it desirable

1418
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,560
bolting is,
is as much of a,

1419
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:50,770
you know,
as a factor with those people as why me?

1420
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:56,130
Why did I get fucked?
Why am I the person with this terrible 

1421
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:56,130
situation when,
why can't I just be normal?

1422
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,400
I don't even.
I mean sure,

1423
00:57:57,401 --> 00:58:02,401
everybody wants people to love them,
but I think what they really want is to 

1424
00:58:02,401 --> 00:58:02,770
just not be a mess,
you know,

1425
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:07,771
to not be a physical mess,
not be some sort of a genetic 

1426
00:58:07,771 --> 00:58:07,880
aberration,
like the,

1427
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,820
you know,
that's what the,

1428
00:58:08,821 --> 00:58:11,260
the feeling of,
the terrible feeling of pain is.

1429
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:16,620
You know,
that's why these guys are all fucked up 

1430
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,391
and angry.
And Gary Coleman was angry as fuck 

1431
00:58:18,391 --> 00:58:18,391
before he died.
You know,

1432
00:58:18,391 --> 00:58:19,810
you always hear about stories about him 
yelling at people like he was.

1433
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:21,480
He had to work a regular job.
Man.

1434
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:25,480
He was working as a security guard.
Could you imagine people would just come

1435
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:26,920
up to him and fuck with them all day?

1436
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:32,300
Yeah.
The only reason I know that is because 

1437
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,130
the Dave Chappelle sketch that he did on
Gary Cole never saw.

1438
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:34,770
Oh,
it's amazing.

1439
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:37,490
It's amazing.
What did he do?

1440
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,740
He plays Gary Cole and so he plays the 
whole sketch on his knees.

1441
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:44,080
Oh,
security and then some chicky chicks,

1442
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:49,190
chicks fighting and then they cut to 
like the chick biting into all bad.

1443
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:54,500
It's so bad.
A Dahlan is security outfit and she's 

1444
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:54,500
tossing.
Gary called Raj.

1445
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,020
He throws in the minutes.

1446
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:57,800
His show is so ridiculous.
What was the one one,

1447
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:01,430
a sketch where he was fighting King Kong
and hit King Kong or Godzilla.

1448
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,120
Godzilla with it

1449
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,070
for cutting down.
What the fuck was that?

1450
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,800
It was so ridiculous.
Which was that sketch?

1451
00:59:07,801 --> 00:59:09,200
I don't know,
but remember when he.

1452
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,060
He has that sketch.
It was the last season,

1453
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,840
the unfinished season where he goes back
and.

1454
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:19,990
And he fucks with everybody who told him
that the people that didn't believe in 

1455
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:20,580
them,
like club owners and all that stuff.

1456
00:59:20,581 --> 00:59:25,581
He blew up like the old club that he was
banned from any.

1457
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:29,780
He fucked up his old acting teacher who 
told him that he would never make it.

1458
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,720
So it's like a sketch where he goes back
and then at the very end when he goes to

1459
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:35,570
the comedy club to blow up the comedy 
club,

1460
00:59:35,571 --> 00:59:37,580
he blows it up and he walks out and 
there's like a,

1461
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:42,450
a lady walking across the street and he 
so on fire that he blew up at the club.

1462
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:47,830
The club owner was in a wheelchair and 
he threw him down the steps and let the 

1463
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:47,830
place on fire.
He takes his baby.

1464
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:52,661
This random ladies cross the street,
takes Texas baby and punk kicks the 

1465
00:59:52,661 --> 00:59:52,661
baby.
Right?

1466
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,670
Just out of nowhere.
That's how to sketch Ed's like he was so

1467
00:59:55,671 --> 01:00:00,130
happy that he got his revenge.
He grabs this newborn baby kicks it.

1468
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,020
Nothing to do with the Scott.

1469
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:07,840
Plus his show was so ridiculous.
Remember the first episode of different 

1470
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,050
strokes with Mr.
Drummond took his two new boys,

1471
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:14,170
Willis and Arnold and got it.
They all got in the hot tub together in 

1472
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:14,170
a.
we're all wearing tighty.

1473
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:14,420
Whities.
No,

1474
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,750
it was really creepy as a kid and it's 
haunts me everyday when I.

1475
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:17,750
Wow.

1476
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,840
How weird is that?
Different strokes.

1477
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,910
That was one of my favorite shots.
It's gross that up.

1478
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,960
Todd was on fear factor and you know,
he's,

1479
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,550
he's an angry dude.
He's got A.

1480
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:31,010
I mean,
he kept it together for the most part up

1481
01:00:31,011 --> 01:00:32,870
until the part where uh,
he,

1482
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,310
he lost,
he got eliminated.

1483
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,500
He didn't even want to shake my hand and
walked away.

1484
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:37,890
Wouldn't shake my hand.
Yeah,

1485
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:42,910
he was upset.
He thought it was some sort of 

1486
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:42,910
conspiracy to make him lose.
I don't,

1487
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:45,260
I don't exactly know what the fuck he 
had to do or what it was,

1488
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:50,290
what he was upset about.
But he decided he didn't want to shake 

1489
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:50,290
my hand.
I'm like,

1490
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:50,360
wow,
now you see why this dude,

1491
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:52,490
you know why his life is kind of fucked 
up like his,

1492
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:57,520
his automatic way of looking at things.
It's like negative is automatic way of 

1493
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:57,740
looking at things was like,
someone's out to get me.

1494
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:59,240
Someone's fucking with me.
Oh,

1495
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:00,130
it ain't going to be fair.
I'll,

1496
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,290
I see how it is.
You know,

1497
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,110
it's like automatically like,
dude,

1498
01:01:03,111 --> 01:01:06,350
this fucking six people on the show,
five of them have to be losers.

1499
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,670
You got,
you're one of the five.

1500
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,660
Shit happens,
man.

1501
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:10,680
You got to move on with your life,
but not for him,

1502
01:01:10,681 --> 01:01:12,440
man.
He's an angry dude,

1503
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,270
which is kind of interesting,
man.

1504
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:17,570
We were talking about this before,
that toxo plasma.

1505
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:21,560
That's that cat tranquilizer or are they
the cat parasite rather?

1506
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:22,550
Um,
W,

1507
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:27,590
we,
we talked about this on other shows 

1508
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:27,590
before,
but I watched a documentary yesterday.

1509
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:31,161
I read some articles about it and this 
thing called toxo plasma is a very 

1510
01:01:31,311 --> 01:01:36,311
common parasite that human beings get 
that completely alters our behavior and 

1511
01:01:36,311 --> 01:01:40,580
get this in Brazil,
66 percent of the population is infected

1512
01:01:40,581 --> 01:01:41,750
with this toxo plasma.

1513
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:46,960
And it does two things.
It makes women submissive and it makes 

1514
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,500
men reckless.
Jerks makes men assholes,

1515
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,800
and it makes chicks submissive.
It sounds like,

1516
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:53,630
um,
like Brazil ecstasy,

1517
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:54,390
dude.
No,

1518
01:01:54,391 --> 01:01:54,560
no,
no,

1519
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:57,470
not like that.
It makes reckless.

1520
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,550
It makes them cope and shit,
but no,

1521
01:01:59,590 --> 01:01:59,810
no,
no,

1522
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:00,090
no,
no,

1523
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,580
it,
it reprograms the mind.

1524
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:03,380
It's a parasite.
This is the crazy thing.

1525
01:02:03,381 --> 01:02:08,381
The parasite exists first in rats and 
what it does with rats is it gets rats 

1526
01:02:08,381 --> 01:02:12,431
convinced that rewires their,
their sexual brain,

1527
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:16,570
the sexual aspect of the brain,
and it gets them to be aroused and,

1528
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:18,950
and,
and connect it to cat piss.

1529
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:19,890
So

1530
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:25,070
these rats,
it hijacks their sexual system so their 

1531
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:26,310
sexual system all of a sudden become 
sexually aroused,

1532
01:02:26,311 --> 01:02:30,240
like their testes swelled or ball swell 
because they smell cat piss.

1533
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,650
So these motherfuckers are searching 
after campus.

1534
01:02:32,651 --> 01:02:37,651
So they're going towards where cats live
be were cats mark their territory.

1535
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:42,890
They're,
they're attracted to that and they're 

1536
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:42,890
not afraid of cats anymore for whatever 
reason.

1537
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:44,640
So the cats obviously eat these rats 
because the rats are retarded.

1538
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:47,550
They stand there where the cats there 
with their balls all swollen and a heart

1539
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:52,551
on the Khakis.
Some the cat eats the rats than the cat 

1540
01:02:52,551 --> 01:02:54,510
hangs around with people and we have to 
clean the cat shit.

1541
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,630
And when people clean the cat shit,
sometimes people touch the cat shit.

1542
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:02,780
And if you touched the cat shit and it 
gets inside your bloodstream through 

1543
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,240
either an open sore or maybe something 
in your food or maybe an open,

1544
01:03:03,241 --> 01:03:08,241
you know,
your touch your eyes or something like 

1545
01:03:08,241 --> 01:03:08,241
that.

1546
01:03:08,241 --> 01:03:08,241
That shit gets in your body,
man.

1547
01:03:08,241 --> 01:03:11,430
And $60,
million people in this country are 

1548
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:12,000
infected by it and it affects your 
behavior.

1549
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,070
It changes your behavior and get it from
low jobs.

1550
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:18,480
Maybe you could get it from reading.
You can get it from touching raw meat as

1551
01:03:18,481 --> 01:03:19,560
well.
The um,

1552
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:23,220
yeah,
it's 60 something million people in this

1553
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:28,221
country are affected by and they said a 
disproportion amount of people who die 

1554
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:31,461
in motorcycle accidents.
One of the things he was talking about 

1555
01:03:31,461 --> 01:03:34,821
was that they would test motorcycle 
accident victims for toxoplasma because 

1556
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:37,290
the toxo plasma,
this parasite that is,

1557
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:42,340
you know,
this cat parasite makes people do 

1558
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:42,340
nobody.
Shit makes people wild.

1559
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:42,960
Cats used to rule the rural and maybe 
they used to like,

1560
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,520
this needs to be bigger than it is.
And how.

1561
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:49,550
Maybe that's what the thing is.
That's why we're getting rid of their 

1562
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:49,550
cats.

1563
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:53,150
Are you getting rid of your cats from?
He's also maybe,

1564
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:56,610
but then he'd be a woman pyramids,
but look,

1565
01:03:56,611 --> 01:04:01,611
if you think about Brazilians,
Brazilian men are notoriously 

1566
01:04:01,611 --> 01:04:01,611
aggressive.
Brazilian women,

1567
01:04:01,611 --> 01:04:03,590
notoriously submissive and sexual.
You know,

1568
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,620
maybe that's what it is.
I mean,

1569
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:09,621
66 percent,
two out of three women of childbearing 

1570
01:04:09,621 --> 01:04:12,770
age are infected with this parasite.
I wonder about something to do with 

1571
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:14,510
their assets if there's a connection.
Do you think that's quite a bit there?

1572
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,170
They're asking.
I mean there's a reason.

1573
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:21,200
There's a reason that 85 percent of all 
women between the ages of 18 and 48 have

1574
01:04:22,531 --> 01:04:24,500
great assets in Rio.
There's,

1575
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:26,490
there's got to be something and it could
be kept paths.

1576
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:31,500
It could be the milk and why do cats,
but they're up in the air when you tap 

1577
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,460
on it because they want you to get that 
dirty shit.

1578
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:33,480
Yeah,
that's right.

1579
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:33,960
It's like,
no,

1580
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:35,230
look,
I got for you.

1581
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:41,300
That's an interesting thing that you 
said that because that's one of the 

1582
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,401
things that this one of these articles 
were saying was that people who are 

1583
01:04:43,401 --> 01:04:47,271
normally polite people when they sneeze 
will sometimes inadvertently or 

1584
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:52,340
unconsciously turned towards people and 
sneeze like they don't even realize why 

1585
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:52,390
they're doing it.
Like they.

1586
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:55,170
They almost have an instinct that turned
towards people in Sneeze.

1587
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,910
I've seen people do it before.
Wow.

1588
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:58,750
Where they go like this,
like you're standing,

1589
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:03,770
you're hearing,
you have like your body is trying to get

1590
01:05:04,831 --> 01:05:06,270
you to fucking blow a sneeze on 
somebody.

1591
01:05:06,271 --> 01:05:08,070
This is the theory.
How many cats do you have?

1592
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:13,200
Any possible?
If you think about what it does to cats 

1593
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,230
and what it does to people,
it's very possible that some viruses 

1594
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:17,140
could try to get you to be attracted to 
people when they expel how many cats you

1595
01:05:17,141 --> 01:05:17,830
have.
I have to,

1596
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:18,010
but

1597
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:23,010
Joey Diaz has 10 or nine.
Fuck Cock sucker stopped bringing up my 

1598
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:23,920
cats.
Got a good amount.

1599
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,590
Y'all need to get tested.
So here's the thing.

1600
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:28,840
I'm being real here.
Oh totally,

1601
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,190
dude.
If you think about that,

1602
01:05:30,191 --> 01:05:30,700
if,
if,

1603
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:34,120
if your cat has ever been outside and 
you think your cat may have eaten a rat,

1604
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:40,000
you know my cats,
I've never been outside of Brazil.

1605
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:42,510
They leave those cats out a little bit.
What's the curator anyway?

1606
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,520
You're fucked.
You might have to change the cat box 

1607
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:47,520
with condoms.
I.

1608
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:47,980
No,
that's not a cure.

1609
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:53,540
What would keep you from infecting other
cats from getting in your poor Cuba.

1610
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:58,210
That's a preventive method.
Once you get it.

1611
01:05:58,211 --> 01:05:59,540
I don't think you could do anything 
about it.

1612
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:01,780
It's just a water bottle that you spray 
yourself with.

1613
01:06:01,781 --> 01:06:02,740
Like,
you know,

1614
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:08,310
it's fascinating.
We think about that your whole life 

1615
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:10,201
could get hijacked,
like some parasite could literally take 

1616
01:06:10,201 --> 01:06:12,940
over your body and talk to your body and
to living a totally different life.

1617
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,630
And what the doctor was talking about 
this,

1618
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,110
the scientists Soplasky I believe his 
name is.

1619
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:22,380
What he was talking about was that the 
idea of free will is really an illusion.

1620
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:27,571
Like there's a bunch of mitigating 
factors that caused you to move in one 

1621
01:06:27,571 --> 01:06:28,360
direction or another and it makes 
certain decisions.

1622
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:33,660
You know?
And so the thing that you have complete 

1623
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:33,660
free will,
is kind of silly if you go on Amazon,

1624
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,540
there's a urine detector for cat urine 
and if you ever buy it,

1625
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,220
just be worn.
It doesn't just detect urine.

1626
01:06:39,221 --> 01:06:41,350
It detects a lot of gross shit.
So,

1627
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:43,390
uh,
it's kind of cool.

1628
01:06:43,391 --> 01:06:45,790
What I like calm,
like if you put it on your bed,

1629
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:47,560
it's just like every,
all this shit comes up.

1630
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:52,561
It's pretty scary dude.
But you've seen those inside edition 

1631
01:06:52,561 --> 01:06:54,160
things where they go to hotel rooms and 
check the covers.

1632
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,190
Oh Dude,
dude.

1633
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:00,200
Just judges all over the covers.
It's like a Goddamn Jackson pollock 

1634
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,781
painting.
Every time you walk into a room with a 

1635
01:07:03,781 --> 01:07:03,781
black light,
just loads everywhere.

1636
01:07:03,781 --> 01:07:06,790
Loads all the floor loads on the wall.
You'll find loads everywhere.

1637
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:12,270
I have,
I've several times I've pulled out a 

1638
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:15,601
load and just just let it drip on the 
fucking carpet in a hotel.

1639
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:22,620
Have you ever thrown your just build in?
Might have.

1640
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,910
I'm just not thinking about it.
I'm not judging.

1641
01:07:24,911 --> 01:07:27,780
You might have for sure,
but I can't remember any.

1642
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,500
Do you ever throw your come on the wall 
at a hotel room?

1643
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,190
No,
never try it.

1644
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:32,770
It's so awesome.
Just take a look.

1645
01:07:32,771 --> 01:07:35,770
Just throw it on the wall.
Spiderman is wrong with you.

1646
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:40,180
Never done that to it.
That is the nastiest fluid.

1647
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,370
It's really pretty much the same thing 
as it's not,

1648
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,090
you know,
phlegm,

1649
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:47,140
but the fact that it also can make 
babies,

1650
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,660
you know,
it just makes it ultra nasty.

1651
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,310
It's weird how some girls love the taste
of it and some girls don't get to choose

1652
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:57,820
between eating a dude's snot and neat 
and dudes load for sure.

1653
01:07:57,821 --> 01:08:02,821
You're going to go with snot as chicks.
Say if a guy's got a gun to your head 

1654
01:08:04,391 --> 01:08:06,260
and you're either going to eat this 
load,

1655
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,360
are you gonna?
Eat some snow.

1656
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:10,330
Like all right,
I'll eat your stock out of not.

1657
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:15,380
It's just rude,
but what if this is not what's coming 

1658
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:15,380
from the guy's Dick?
Awesome.

1659
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,980
That doesn't even make sense.
Somehow they put it in their ultimate 

1660
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:24,041
world.
Pack out like a pastry,

1661
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:27,870
right?
Brendan?

1662
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:30,410
Come from a tick or not from a dick.
Which one would you take?

1663
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,560
One of those pastry things called let's 
pastry scribes off cook measure.

1664
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:39,590
You could do that stuff,
stuff so on.

1665
01:08:39,591 --> 01:08:42,650
Snow up your load of your Dick like that
and then squeeze it out.

1666
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:47,120
Dick spit spit out like that one.
I'm going to use that.

1667
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,240
Have you guys been to six flags lately?
No,

1668
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,060
I just have.
I just found out I went.

1669
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:53,930
It was like I live like 15 miles away 
from it,

1670
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:56,060
so I got a season pass to the pool when 
stuff.

1671
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:01,320
Fifteen months.
It's amazing though if you go on the 

1672
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,271
rides during the day i.
it's amazing like how like the people 

1673
01:09:04,271 --> 01:09:07,181
that work there roller,
like if you go on the highest biggest 

1674
01:09:07,181 --> 01:09:09,821
roller coaster,
you get the best employees I guess at 

1675
01:09:09,821 --> 01:09:09,821
work,
at six flags.

1676
01:09:09,821 --> 01:09:12,800
But if you go on like that one boat that
just rocks up and down.

1677
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:16,930
You obviously have the worst employees.
I had one guy and I swear to God I'm.

1678
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,570
He might be like mentally handicapped by
that,

1679
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:20,570
so I don't want,
you know,

1680
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,590
but he's literally like,
like,

1681
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:26,750
like seriously he's operating the 
operating the right.

1682
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:28,220
Like I don't even,
like I looked at him,

1683
01:09:28,221 --> 01:09:33,221
I'm like,
can I put my water bottle on the ground 

1684
01:09:33,221 --> 01:09:33,221
here?
And he was like,

1685
01:09:33,221 --> 01:09:36,700
glassy stare.
Like he had no idea he was even there 

1686
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:36,860
and I recorded.
He's operating the ride.

1687
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:41,861
Yeah.
Every will have a video of this video 

1688
01:09:41,861 --> 01:09:41,861
but have his voice of hope of us getting
on the ride.

1689
01:09:41,861 --> 01:09:43,800
Oh my God.
And I'll play through the second year.

1690
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,320
But it.
By the way,

1691
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,500
Ben,
have you been on the roller coaster?

1692
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,850
If they've been playing or that they 
have out nowadays?

1693
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:53,960
I will never do that extra.
It's not like.

1694
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:57,590
It's not like a regular rollercoaster 
around where you see where you're going.

1695
01:09:57,591 --> 01:09:59,660
You see the loops,
they flip you upside down,

1696
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:00,890
you're upside down,
you're going bash.

1697
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:03,560
Start out backwards.
It's fucking hard.

1698
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:04,260
Rough all.
Yeah.

1699
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:07,090
You guys,
there's no way you can't be sued.

1700
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:08,540
My toes were curling.
Yeah.

1701
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:10,610
That's the one that does like five 
different,

1702
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:12,500
like five dimensions or whatever they 
say.

1703
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:15,050
Is that the one you're talking about 
where it's like spins up and down?

1704
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:16,500
Why you're going upside down.
Got the video.

1705
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:17,360
Here it is.
Alright.

1706
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,830
Explain this again for people just 
tuning.

1707
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:24,850
All right,
this is the swing ride where you get on 

1708
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:27,070
like you know,
like to get on the ride and this is the 

1709
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:28,790
guy that knows a guy operating the Rod.
That was really dumb.

1710
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,470
Scary.
I'm very scared though right now.

1711
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:30,920
Listen.

1712
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,270
Oh my God.
It's pretty incredible.

1713
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,820
That's insane.
That guy is the guy who's operating this

1714
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:20,820
fucking death machines and I,
like I had said,

1715
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:26,010
I had said something to him and I had 
said something to him and like he looked

1716
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:28,410
at me right in the eye,
but it was like glass.

1717
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:29,490
It was like,
wow,

1718
01:11:29,491 --> 01:11:32,640
this guy is not like this murder guy.
I mean,

1719
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,160
you know,
maybe the dude is super responsible just

1720
01:11:35,161 --> 01:11:36,960
because he has this tremendous speech 
impediment.

1721
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:40,470
Maybe he's a super responsible super 
conscientious guy.

1722
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:43,860
May have ever thought maybe it was 
death.

1723
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,530
Maybe you can't hear people screaming to
stop the ride.

1724
01:11:46,531 --> 01:11:49,830
That can't be good if you're.
The fucking dude has got the hand on the

1725
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:50,760
ride button.
Do that.

1726
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:52,900
Ride was nothing.
Babies go on those lines.

1727
01:11:52,901 --> 01:11:56,730
I like.
It's like a merry go round with swings.

1728
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:57,930
What was it?
Which one was it?

1729
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:03,740
That one?
That one is the one we're just spinning 

1730
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:03,740
in a circle,
which is swings,

1731
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:03,740
but,
but still,

1732
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:04,320
I mean it's a ride,
you know,

1733
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:05,430
and then.
Okay.

1734
01:12:05,431 --> 01:12:07,430
So you still think it's too dangerous 
for retarded.

1735
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:08,730
It's something.
Where's that happened?

1736
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,390
Was,
do you think he got it?

1737
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,020
What do you think was wrong with him?
I think he was special.

1738
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:14,490
Maybe special,
special,

1739
01:12:14,491 --> 01:12:15,930
special Ed.
Special Olympics.

1740
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,870
There's no way.
There's no way magic amount would hire a

1741
01:12:18,871 --> 01:12:19,650
retard.
Okay.

1742
01:12:19,651 --> 01:12:20,650
But with what?
If there's,

1743
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:25,850
there's,
there's all sorts of levels of 

1744
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:25,850
impairment that human being suffer.
Maybe he passed the test,

1745
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,030
like with colors and stuff.
Is there a test?

1746
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,680
Probably.
What do you think the test is?

1747
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:33,770
Like?
Colors and shapes and those shapes that 

1748
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:33,770
you put in,
like the circles.

1749
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:33,770
That's why it seems like the test 
wouldn't be there.

1750
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:38,630
You know,
the odds of getting killed in one of 

1751
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:38,630
those accidents is very,
very slim.

1752
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:40,650
But what had happens,
God town that must suck.

1753
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:46,060
You know,
you put yourself on some wacky 

1754
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:46,060
rollercoaster,
flips you around,

1755
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:46,980
you wind up dying.
He imagine hanging out with a dude,

1756
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:52,070
we got to get a depth dude and on 
crystal meth where he just can't shut 

1757
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:55,530
up,
shut up.

1758
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,630
He's got so many stories to tell you.

1759
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:04,790
By the way,
that guy was not deaf because when I 

1760
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,741
asked him that question,
he turned around when I asked him about 

1761
01:13:06,741 --> 01:13:07,290
the water bottle,
it's way hollow,

1762
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,090
so he's not,
he wasn't deaf.

1763
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:13,170
So you think he maybe had some sort of 
autism or something like that?

1764
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:16,140
Maybe,
but impediment for sure.

1765
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:19,140
Right.
How ridiculous is that on another ride?

1766
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,940
Again,
it wasn't like the biggest,

1767
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:22,560
right was like a,
it was called the Ninja,

1768
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:24,580
which is a rollercoaster,
but uh,

1769
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:29,780
they were going to check everybody's 
like straps and stuff and the guy just 

1770
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:29,910
like,
you see them checking it.

1771
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,170
Then he goes to mind.
You just touch it.

1772
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,580
Like he just tapped it.
I'm like,

1773
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:35,250
you weren't even lifting or any that,
you just touched it.

1774
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,380
Just touching.
It does not check anything,

1775
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,580
you know,
I think I was like,

1776
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:41,520
did he just touch it?
Know what I mean?

1777
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,860
Like how they lived it.
They assume that it's,

1778
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,790
it can be loose and you can go flying 
out.

1779
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:53,060
Yeah,
and it would have fucking scary way to 

1780
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:53,060
die.
That must be.

1781
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,280
And then there was this like this guy 
that like he kept on Splat,

1782
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,320
like we're waiting in line for like a 
raft ride and it was really hot and so 

1783
01:13:59,320 --> 01:13:59,910
every couple minutes he would like 
splash.

1784
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,790
Everybody that's in line with water.
Like he was the lifeguard.

1785
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:07,940
Now he's the one that pushed you down 
over the side in this raft for every 

1786
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:11,181
couple minutes who like splash you.
And he kept them like fucking kicking 

1787
01:14:11,181 --> 01:14:12,040
water in my face.
So when I got up there I just started

1788
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,880
fucking kicking water back at him and he
goes and he blew the whistle.

1789
01:14:14,881 --> 01:14:16,480
Go take.
We've got a problem here.

1790
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,590
And I'm like,
wait,

1791
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:22,860
I can't splash you.
You just got done fucking splashing me 

1792
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,171
for 15 minutes.
So now I'm feeling like I'm getting in 

1793
01:14:25,171 --> 01:14:26,080
fights with people that are here to make
sure I'm part of the ride.

1794
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,220
That he splashes you.
No,

1795
01:14:27,221 --> 01:14:27,520
no,
no.

1796
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,740
This is while we're waiting in line and 
he just being a dick,

1797
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:34,770
he's just being a ticket,
like spraying people with water and he 

1798
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:37,141
was doing it like three.
He hit probably hit me like three or 

1799
01:14:37,141 --> 01:14:37,141
five times.
While.

1800
01:14:37,141 --> 01:14:37,141
Did you ask him to stop?
No,

1801
01:14:37,141 --> 01:14:37,900
everyone.
Everyone aligned was like,

1802
01:14:37,901 --> 01:14:38,800
what the fuck?
Stop.

1803
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:43,801
You know,
like there was like parents and stuff 

1804
01:14:43,801 --> 01:14:43,801
and kids and the kids were.
The kids were liking it,

1805
01:14:43,801 --> 01:14:43,900
but you know,
it's like,

1806
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:45,090
hey,
you're the kids will login.

1807
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,560
Yeah,
but you know,

1808
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,090
I splashed them back because like,
hey,

1809
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:54,610
here's this thing that you have to 
consider back to the subject of 

1810
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:54,610
parasites when you're at those water 
parks,

1811
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:58,891
man,
you have to be real careful of 

1812
01:14:58,891 --> 01:14:59,890
swallowing that water.
That water is funky as fuck dude.

1813
01:14:59,891 --> 01:15:03,890
I saw and heard in the water.
Oh do no doubt there.

1814
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,010
There's like a pool,
like a wave pool and then they have like

1815
01:15:06,011 --> 01:15:11,011
the small,
like pool for just like kids and stuff 

1816
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:13,621
like that.
I know a woman who was a nurse and her 

1817
01:15:13,621 --> 01:15:16,150
daughter went to one of those parks,
swallow some water and got horribly sick

1818
01:15:16,151 --> 01:15:19,930
and became paralyzed.
She got some sort of terrible infection.

1819
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:24,070
She was deathly ill and she wound up 
with a limited use of her legs.

1820
01:15:24,071 --> 01:15:24,760
Man.
Wow.

1821
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:28,620
These serious infections can fuck with 
your.

1822
01:15:28,621 --> 01:15:31,570
Your whole system.
That's horrible infection.

1823
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:33,250
You know Cole Escovedo,
you know,

1824
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:33,880
call us,
can veto.

1825
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:36,220
He had staff and he was paralyzed.
Man.

1826
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:41,700
He almost couldn't walk again.
It took him like over a year to recover 

1827
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,450
from that shit.
You can get an infection,

1828
01:15:43,451 --> 01:15:48,451
dude.
That just wrecks your whole life and 

1829
01:15:48,451 --> 01:15:50,770
those water parks are prime.
That water is not clean at all.

1830
01:15:50,771 --> 01:15:53,650
That water is death.
You swallow a mouthful.

1831
01:15:53,651 --> 01:15:55,810
That water,
like if you go to a water park with your

1832
01:15:55,811 --> 01:16:00,811
kids,
you got to be real upfront with them 

1833
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:00,811
about this.
You've got to say,

1834
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:01,360
you cannot take this water in your 
mouth.

1835
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:03,780
This is bad.
Dangerous for real.

1836
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:08,790
It sounds ridiculous,
but you really shouldn't take your kids 

1837
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:08,790
on those slides.
Are Those water rides?

1838
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:13,410
They get a mouthful of that shit.
Your little four year old who doesn't 

1839
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:13,900
know any better.
They could get fucking deathly ill.

1840
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:18,901
They could die.
Did you know you're not supposed to 

1841
01:16:18,901 --> 01:16:18,901
swallow even eight drop of toothpastes.

1842
01:16:18,901 --> 01:16:19,660
Yeah.
Toothpaste has.

1843
01:16:19,661 --> 01:16:21,080
Fluoride is poisonous.
Yeah.

1844
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:25,630
Fluoride is bad for you.
I used to as a kid when I was like drunk

1845
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:30,631
driving.
I'll keep toothpaste in my car now like 

1846
01:16:30,631 --> 01:16:31,180
put it in my mouth and switching between
mouth and swallow it dying now.

1847
01:16:31,181 --> 01:16:33,670
That's why you're rotting out from the 
inside.

1848
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:39,390
That's why you got that cat piss gone.
It's fighting the cat piss dude.

1849
01:16:40,241 --> 01:16:41,120
It's no joke,
man.

1850
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:42,290
Fluoride is scary shit.
Yeah.

1851
01:16:42,291 --> 01:16:47,291
That's the reason why it kills 
everything in the water and everything 

1852
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:49,291
in your mouth.
It just seems like you should tell 

1853
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:49,291
people that,
hey,

1854
01:16:49,291 --> 01:16:49,450
this thing that you put in your mouth 
don't swallow it.

1855
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:50,790
Yeah.
No one ever told me that,

1856
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:55,900
that I buy hippie toothpaste.
I buy that uncle Tom's of Maine stuff.

1857
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,270
It doesn't have any anything or Tom's of
Maine.

1858
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:03,300
Uncle Tom.
I made him uncle Tom Guide us to eat TV 

1859
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:07,561
Guy TV guy.
I would send out pieces of paper I call 

1860
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:10,280
complete

1861
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:15,280
page,
but I would snack on little pieces of 

1862
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:15,280
it.
Are you fucking serious?

1863
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:15,280
Seriously.
He had like this with this.

1864
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,380
I guess I was mineral deficient or 
something and needed fiber or something.

1865
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:21,410
I see the TV guide.
I sleep buggers.

1866
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:23,390
You guys.
Everyone needs to eat burgers,

1867
01:17:23,391 --> 01:17:23,910
right?
No,

1868
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:29,190
it wasn't.
I was in the building with dirt and 

1869
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:29,190
grass.
I like taking.

1870
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:32,750
I like taking like a real wet sloppy 
booker.

1871
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:34,310
And did you just keep rolling it?
Working,

1872
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:39,340
getting your finger until a solid ball,
like making bread.

1873
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,610
I know what I mean.
Fighting back at dry heave.

1874
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:48,970
I used to eat grass so much time ago to 
grasp so much as a kid that now I could 

1875
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:51,560
get wheat grass juice and I love the 
taste of wheat grass just because I used

1876
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:53,550
to eat so much grass as a kid.
Oh,

1877
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:56,400
I fucked up Jamba juice on me to do 
this,

1878
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:58,280
but there's this girl,
she.

1879
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:00,680
She got me my wheat grass juice and she 
goes,

1880
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:02,360
do you want to Orange chaser with it?
And I go,

1881
01:18:02,361 --> 01:18:03,080
no,
I'm okay.

1882
01:18:03,081 --> 01:18:03,680
I'm like,
oh,

1883
01:18:03,681 --> 01:18:06,200
this stuff is nasty,
and I downed it and she goes,

1884
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,550
she goes,
do you think it's nasty?

1885
01:18:07,551 --> 01:18:08,540
I love the taste.
I go,

1886
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:09,710
oh,
that's because you're a cow.

1887
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:15,410
Oh,
you really did mean that though.

1888
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:18,530
What?
Are you a cow pig?

1889
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:20,140
No,
she wasn't because every girl.

1890
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:22,580
But if it was a dude,
you know,

1891
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:24,770
we were joking around before that,
you know,

1892
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,280
it was all friendly talk and I just 
totally didn't.

1893
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:33,310
You can't call it girl cow.
You could tell it to cow like of a guy 

1894
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:33,310
said,
you know,

1895
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,150
Oh,
I love to taste sweet grass.

1896
01:18:35,151 --> 01:18:38,280
Like what are you a fucking cow?
Like joking around with them.

1897
01:18:38,281 --> 01:18:40,970
Like as long as you're laughing and 
smiling it will be all fun.

1898
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,980
But with a girl you can never call her 
cow.

1899
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,260
I could call you a cow eating grass.
I'm like,

1900
01:18:45,261 --> 01:18:46,370
what?
Are you a fucking cow?

1901
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,290
Or You could call a white guy.
Like if he's a beast,

1902
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:52,790
motherfuckers a gorilla gorilla all the 
time.

1903
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,860
Yeah.
You can't say that about a black.

1904
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:58,100
They get mad.
Do you guys saying.

1905
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,690
What are we saying?
How would they get mad?

1906
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:03,110
What the fuck,
Brian even bringing it up.

1907
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:05,150
I totally right after it came out of my 
mouth.

1908
01:19:05,151 --> 01:19:10,151
I wanted to take it back,
but then I told him I want to address 

1909
01:19:10,151 --> 01:19:10,151
it.
I didn't want to.

1910
01:19:10,151 --> 01:19:11,110
I don't know.
I really don't mean you're a cow.

1911
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:16,440
I was just a.
It was a terrible idea to joke that I 

1912
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,941
wasn't thinking.
I just set it and then after this kate 

1913
01:19:18,941 --> 01:19:18,941
my mouth,
I was like,

1914
01:19:18,941 --> 01:19:20,030
oh you dick,
but it didn't mean to be a dick.

1915
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:23,990
So I'm in this new part of our 
relationship where when I fart,

1916
01:19:23,991 --> 01:19:28,991
I can't say it's a fart yet.
So how do you get to that part of the 

1917
01:19:28,991 --> 01:19:28,991
relationship where you could just be 
like,

1918
01:19:28,991 --> 01:19:33,731
oh,
I farted because I'm so tired of 

1919
01:19:33,731 --> 01:19:33,731
blaming.
Don't go there.

1920
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:37,130
It'll kill everything.
Be Honest.

1921
01:19:37,131 --> 01:19:40,030
Is the sex drive exactly where it was 
was from the.

1922
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,500
From the beginning to the way it is now.
Same thing.

1923
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:43,210
Yeah,
absolutely.

1924
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:48,230
Has tapered off at all for good reasons.
The other day it was so bad.

1925
01:19:49,611 --> 01:19:54,611
I had no excuses.
I couldn't say the cat did because I've 

1926
01:19:54,611 --> 01:19:55,130
said it so many times.
Luckily she didn't say a word,

1927
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,570
you know,
you should just ignore it.

1928
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,320
No,
just,

1929
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:02,470
you know,
in the middle of the night while you're 

1930
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:04,241
sleeping,
punch her in the nose and then her nose 

1931
01:20:04,241 --> 01:20:07,751
will swell up.
She'll get a deviated septum and it 

1932
01:20:07,751 --> 01:20:07,940
makes it much harder to smell farts.
Flirting

1933
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,980
in your sleep and then you,
you ever fired so loud,

1934
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,490
you wake up in your sleep.
You okay to Fart in front of your girl?

1935
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:14,340
I don't.
Just out of respect.

1936
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:18,300
Do you leave the room or do you have 
like if she walks in,

1937
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:19,530
like she'll walk into my office.
I'm like,

1938
01:20:19,531 --> 01:20:23,890
you better back the fuck up.
I just farted in front of extent.

1939
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,920
I wonder if Fart in front of me.
This is what I'm thinking is there's 

1940
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:29,160
times where I have to fart really,
really bad,

1941
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:31,680
but I'll just hold that motherfucker and
then I fall asleep.

1942
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:34,050
Is there any way you hold it while 
you're still asleep?

1943
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:34,720
No.
No,

1944
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:35,880
no,
no way.

1945
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:38,120
I had an ex girlfriend wake me up 
because she was farting.

1946
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:41,160
She farted it so loud.
It woke me up and I was like,

1947
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:43,580
what the fuck did I hear?
I was like looking her ass.

1948
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:47,970
And then a second one came out loud one 
and then she woke up.

1949
01:20:47,971 --> 01:20:49,080
She was like,
what happened?

1950
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:50,010
I go,
yeah,

1951
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:52,290
what happened?
Then I went back to see,

1952
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:57,620
you know,
those vacuums that they have at the car 

1953
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:57,620
wash places,
you know what I mean?

1954
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,980
If they'd have one right by your bed.
So you just kinda like a smoke smoking 

1955
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:05,050
going.
You'd always have to think about it 

1956
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:05,310
getting stuck to your ass.
When I did,

1957
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:11,230
what I did last night is I got off the 
Internet is that you take a little bit 

1958
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:11,350
of Vicks Vapor Rub and put around your 
asshole.

1959
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:13,200
So even if it does far,
just much like Vick's vapor rub.

1960
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,560
So the Internet got a tip to do that.
Yeah.

1961
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,790
You tried that and your asshole is going
to light on fire.

1962
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,000
That's terrible advice to put capsaicin.
Rubbing your butthole is like open 

1963
01:21:26,371 --> 01:21:27,180
source.

1964
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,250
It's like an open wound,
you know,

1965
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:31,260
it's super,
super open skin.

1966
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:36,320
It's incredible airtight.
It is because you know there's like a 

1967
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:36,870
gigantic explosion like right there at 
the end of year you can smell it,

1968
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:40,040
so what can you do besides vapor?
Rub that with you,

1969
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:43,620
like if you rub like shaving cream or 
alcohol,

1970
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,320
aftershave on your hands.
It never bothers you at all,

1971
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:48,990
but if you rub that shit on your balls,
it's going to fucking hurt.

1972
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:54,170
And your balls dip your Dick in it.
If you dip your Dick and that stuff and 

1973
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:55,560
touches like that soft tissue,
you put that around your asshole.

1974
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,360
What about just some bubble gum or 
something?

1975
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,000
Just plug it up with some bubble gum 
before you go to bed.

1976
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:05,600
Put roses around it like glue roses 
around until took us through a rose 

1977
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:05,600
filter.
Some lemon juice.

1978
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:10,131
Maybe that's what you could do.
Make a filter out of roses like a 

1979
01:22:10,131 --> 01:22:11,430
diaphragm as little stickies on it on 
the side,

1980
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,050
and just stick it right to your 
butthole.

1981
01:22:13,051 --> 01:22:14,820
So it's like a filter.
So when you fart,

1982
01:22:14,821 --> 01:22:19,821
it goes through an snl sketch like maybe
15 years ago with commercial parody 

1983
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,910
where they go now you can,
you know.

1984
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,550
No more embarrassing farts.
What are they?

1985
01:22:23,551 --> 01:22:28,551
Take a big horn and he stuck a big horn 
in your ass and then when you were at 

1986
01:22:28,551 --> 01:22:28,890
park,
that'd be an electronic voice that said,

1987
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,770
how bout them doctor?

1988
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:37,910
That was all about them dodgers and then
it did filter out your farts smell.

1989
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:47,590
It is pretty incredible when you think 
about all the technology that we have 

1990
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:51,231
that we have zero invested in farts.
We have nothing invested in cleaning up 

1991
01:22:51,331 --> 01:22:56,331
the smell of forest.
There's no product farts or like a 

1992
01:22:56,331 --> 01:22:59,391
normal part of everyone's day and yet 
there's no technology that exists to try

1993
01:22:59,491 --> 01:23:04,491
to deal with.
Be like a Fart sucker built inside the 

1994
01:23:04,491 --> 01:23:07,041
seat cushion where you sit down and it's
like right there and you could secretly 

1995
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:09,210
just press that button.
Why don't they have writers?

1996
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:14,430
They have a filter on the top of my 
litter box so that I don't smell my 

1997
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:14,740
cat's shit.
There's a charcoal filter.

1998
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:16,870
Why don't they make filters for your 
underwear if you like.

1999
01:23:16,871 --> 01:23:21,871
If you like to eat a lot of Mexican food
or if you're going out drinking and you 

2000
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:22,180
know you're gonna be farting,
why don't they have some filters?

2001
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:25,060
That's a good idea.
Like a fart.

2002
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:26,870
Kotex?
Yeah,

2003
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,070
exactly.
Like the FARC,

2004
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:33,080
Kotex build into your underwear.
Your Saturday night party in short and 

2005
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:38,700
he your Saturday night party and 
underwear and they have built in 

2006
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,170
charcoal filter in there to sent it like
strawberries or something like that.

2007
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,580
Like a butt plug to take because you got
to fuck with the noise through.

2008
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:49,620
The noise is going to happen,
so you need to stick something in your 

2009
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:49,970
ass like maybe a couple inches and then 
it just got something real list.

2010
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:53,390
The knowledge will be way muffled if 
you've got a Kotex over your bundle.

2011
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,260
How much?
Not a real loud one.

2012
01:23:56,261 --> 01:23:56,950
Right?
Well,

2013
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:02,240
I'll tell you what,
Tate Fletcher would be their fucking 

2014
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:05,311
product management guy.
He'd be the one to test to see the 

2015
01:24:05,311 --> 01:24:05,320
efficacy of their individuals.
Filters.

2016
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:11,560
Sounds,
sounds with a clipboard like organizing.

2017
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:18,030
He's like head of the science team,
but it's and it's all built around his 

2018
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:18,030
gas.

2019
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:22,590
Put the stethoscope notice stomach to 
try to determine whether that is ready 

2020
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:22,700
to fart.
Fart.

2021
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:23,800
No,
it's hot as fuck.

2022
01:24:23,801 --> 01:24:26,110
It's hot.
I got to my ac broke and the side of the

2023
01:24:26,111 --> 01:24:27,880
house.
I got to get it fixed.

2024
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:30,130
Get some Mexicans to fix that.
Hey,

2025
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:32,350
what the fuck again?
With the Mexicans?

2026
01:24:32,351 --> 01:24:33,940
Man.
Jesus.

2027
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:36,880
So speaking of Mexicans,
the Gulf of Mexico,

2028
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:41,900
the fucking oil spill,
they've just determined that the oil is 

2029
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:44,731
coming out in multiple locations.
They've just confirmed that it's not 

2030
01:24:44,731 --> 01:24:46,120
just this one spot.
So even if they dig this relief,

2031
01:24:46,121 --> 01:24:51,121
well it's still might be fucked because 
the oil is coming out from all these 

2032
01:24:51,121 --> 01:24:52,240
different spots like very far away from 
each other.

2033
01:24:52,241 --> 01:24:53,500
It's a fucking mess.
Dude.

2034
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,470
Fucked up Cancun yet.
I don't know.

2035
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:59,160
Once it goes around the Florida and goes
up the code,

2036
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:01,870
that's crazy because I mean just think 
myrtle beach,

2037
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:03,130
Florida,
beaches,

2038
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:04,710
all that shit's not going to get a swim.

2039
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:09,720
Then beach on the east coast,
all those beaches of Jack duty might go 

2040
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:09,720
to England.
Yeah.

2041
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:14,460
It's the whole thing.
It's so incredible that they don't have 

2042
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:18,001
a way to stop the oil,
that they're allowed to make these 

2043
01:25:18,001 --> 01:25:20,701
things and not have fail safes.
You would think there would be a bunch 

2044
01:25:20,701 --> 01:25:20,701
of set failsafes if there's a rupture in
this line.

2045
01:25:20,701 --> 01:25:22,300
We shut it off here.
There's a rupture here.

2046
01:25:22,301 --> 01:25:27,301
We shut it off here.
This way we can absolutely ensure that 

2047
01:25:27,301 --> 01:25:27,350
will be no pollution comes out of this.
Well,

2048
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:30,190
animals are going to evolve and thrive 
in the oil.

2049
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:34,280
Probably not going to happen.
What's probably gonna happen,

2050
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:37,560
we may be millions of years from now if 
I kept talking to what's going to happen

2051
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:39,790
to kill all these animals off.
Oh,

2052
01:25:39,791 --> 01:25:42,250
make belief.
Mon Southern Fire Monster.

2053
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:47,970
Some fucking dragon that eats the oil 
and that stores in like a special gland 

2054
01:25:47,970 --> 01:25:52,860
has got rocks in the back of his throat 
and so it sparks up the flame to how 

2055
01:25:53,951 --> 01:25:58,951
many dragons are there an ancient 
cultures and where the fuck that come 

2056
01:25:58,951 --> 01:25:58,951
from dragons.
Does that still exist?

2057
01:25:58,951 --> 01:26:03,691
Man?
I went to the zoo and some of these 

2058
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:05,641
lizard things,
those looked like fucking like Komodo 

2059
01:26:05,641 --> 01:26:05,641
dragons.
That shit's crazy.

2060
01:26:05,641 --> 01:26:07,130
If you just have you seen it?
Yeah.

2061
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:08,950
I think Komodo dragons were just like,
you know,

2062
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:14,000
dwarfs of the big old relative to 
Chinese dragon came from someone saw 

2063
01:26:14,331 --> 01:26:18,290
like a crocodile or a Komodo Dragon.
I just drew it in the story.

2064
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:21,050
Went back and forth,
rawlings being misinterpreted.

2065
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,790
You know,
like when you were saying that dude,

2066
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,800
like there's drama that people tales and
stuff.

2067
01:26:24,801 --> 01:26:27,290
That's just some gay guy that depth.
Some dude was drawing,

2068
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:29,030
you know,
like he was dressed up as a dragon or it

2069
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:30,110
could have been like,
you know,

2070
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:32,120
the national enquirer for 6,000
years ago.

2071
01:26:32,121 --> 01:26:33,840
They were just making shit up.
Exactly.

2072
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,110
Yeah.
That's possible.

2073
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,610
Okay.
If you had to believe in one.

2074
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:44,290
Dragons are vampires attitudes.
One Dragon Dragon's dude.

2075
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:48,410
Vampires are so stupid to think about 
that.

2076
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:49,670
Think about that.
I believe.

2077
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:52,210
Will.
Where will this be for bleeding?

2078
01:26:52,630 --> 01:26:53,740
Cool Dragon?
No,

2079
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:55,500
I believe vampires before.
I believe where will,

2080
01:26:55,570 --> 01:27:00,570
because I've seen vampires.
What could it be is it could be some 

2081
01:27:00,570 --> 01:27:00,700
sort of a parasite,
something that hijacks your system,

2082
01:27:00,701 --> 01:27:02,540
but vampires is supposed to be dead and 
you can't.

2083
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:07,690
But what if the parasite hijacks your,
your aging system too and keeps you 

2084
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:07,690
alive,
but it makes you feast on blood.

2085
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:11,420
It could be just the idea of a blood 
sucking person,

2086
01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:16,570
a person that lives off blood that a 
parasite could trick you into doing 

2087
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:19,901
that.
That is way more possible than a 

2088
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,361
werewolf.
Some of the changes back and forth to 

2089
01:27:22,361 --> 01:27:22,361
another animal.
And then back again.

2090
01:27:22,361 --> 01:27:26,230
That's ridiculous.
So you're saying that Sun can burn 

2091
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:26,230
people during the day?
No,

2092
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:29,170
but I can't say that if they,
if they had some sort of a crazy,

2093
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:34,420
a blood problem,
you know where they may be in intensely 

2094
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:37,691
anemic,
they might have like a real aversion to 

2095
01:27:37,691 --> 01:27:40,151
sun.
They might lose the pigment in their 

2096
01:27:40,151 --> 01:27:40,151
eyes.
It's possible,

2097
01:27:40,151 --> 01:27:43,001
man,
if you think you see the shit that 

2098
01:27:43,001 --> 01:27:45,161
parasites do do to different insects,
different caterpillars and bugs and ants

2099
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:50,291
and all sorts of different things.
Their whole bodies get hijacked by 

2100
01:27:50,291 --> 01:27:51,350
parasites,
completely rewires their entire system.

2101
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,930
It happens to frogs and happens to 
lizards.

2102
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:59,080
So many different animals exist in the 
animal kingdom and it just recently 

2103
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,640
discovering new parasites that hijack 
new hosts caused them to do.

2104
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:05,300
Let's get this straight.
The cat parasites make women more horny.

2105
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,580
It makes women more submissive.
It makes.

2106
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:12,660
I mean,
there's all sorts of interpretation of 

2107
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:12,660
what,
how it exactly affects them,

2108
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:15,350
but it seems to make men and women the 
opposite makes men more aggressive.

2109
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,420
Women.
They going crazy guy with a beard down,

2110
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,830
calm down.
Brazilian women aren't calm.

2111
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:25,100
Well then that doesn't make sense 
because they're wild too,

2112
01:28:25,101 --> 01:28:28,010
and they have to deal with all those 
wild men so it makes them extra wire.

2113
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,120
What are you saying,
man?

2114
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:32,270
This is all based off the research guy.
No,

2115
01:28:32,271 --> 01:28:32,660
no,
no,

2116
01:28:32,661 --> 01:28:32,990
no,
no,

2117
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:33,890
no,
no,

2118
01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:34,220
no,
no,

2119
01:28:34,221 --> 01:28:34,520
no,
no.

2120
01:28:34,521 --> 01:28:38,700
Toxo toxo plasma is a very well 
established overtaking.

2121
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:39,710
No,
no,

2122
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:40,460
no.
This.

2123
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,030
No,
no.

2124
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:46,030
It's not.
This says 6 million people or or 60 

2125
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:46,850
million people rather than America 
habit.

2126
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:49,340
This is the CDC there.
If you look online,

2127
01:28:49,341 --> 01:28:51,590
there's many different studies,
many different ports,

2128
01:28:51,591 --> 01:28:53,270
many different scientists working on 
this.

2129
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:58,420
Toxo plasma is a very real parasite.
That is his actual d actually detectable

2130
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:04,481
and people that they know is responsible
in part or connected in part to uh,

2131
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:06,720
all sorts of different psychological 
ailments.

2132
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:07,870
Yeah,
but the part that it.

2133
01:29:07,871 --> 01:29:10,820
Schizophrenia making girls submissive.
That part of this whole.

2134
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,170
I know one guy saying this.
No,

2135
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:15,220
it's a bunch of.
It would also train.

2136
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:18,120
It changes all sorts of animals.
I said it changes.

2137
01:29:18,121 --> 01:29:19,560
Rats,
makes them attracted.

2138
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:22,410
Cat piss changes.
Men makes them assholes.

2139
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:25,900
Makes him reckless.
It's really fascinating stuff.

2140
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,040
And when you research and you think 
about how many different parasites might

2141
01:29:30,041 --> 01:29:35,041
exist that we don't even buy my shit 
don't work.

2142
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:39,490
Check,
check,

2143
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,010
check,
check,

2144
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:47,930
check,
check.

2145
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:53,450
Okay.
How much was out just for 20 seconds 

2146
01:29:53,450 --> 01:29:55,820
talking about campus anyway.
We know.

2147
01:29:55,910 --> 01:30:00,910
We know that these parasites exist and 
we know that these parasites affect 

2148
01:30:00,910 --> 01:30:02,570
people and if we know there's just a 
couple of them,

2149
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:06,410
how do we not know that there's a bunch 
more that we haven't detected yet?

2150
01:30:06,411 --> 01:30:11,411
What about use as a kid?
He used to eat those green weeds with a 

2151
01:30:11,411 --> 01:30:13,400
yellow flower on the top.
Did you ever eat those?

2152
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,860
Dogs would piss on them.
Dogs a piano,

2153
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:16,520
um,
and I would eat them.

2154
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:18,140
Oh,
dandelions.

2155
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:22,100
The green stocks with a yellow flower at
the Dandelion.

2156
01:30:22,101 --> 01:30:24,710
Dandelions you eat,
eat the grass.

2157
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:29,690
Dogs piss on them all the time.
I got take a piss is good for you.

2158
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:34,780
Oh Man.
You have some sort of crazy pissed 

2159
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:34,780
parasite.
Have you ever thought about that?

2160
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:36,680
How crazy that is though,
that if there really is a,

2161
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:40,250
an animal parasite that makes people 
like aggressive,

2162
01:30:40,251 --> 01:30:42,710
it makes women's submissive.
Like that is Brazil.

2163
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:47,820
Like dudes are super aggressive cocaine 
that makes cocaine,

2164
01:30:49,461 --> 01:30:54,461
makes women's summit,
so it makes them drop to their knees 

2165
01:30:54,461 --> 01:30:54,461
immediately.
That's just because they need that.

2166
01:30:54,461 --> 01:30:57,140
They're just happy to get that coke or 
coke.

2167
01:30:57,141 --> 01:31:00,770
Makes them immediately submissive.
I think it's cooked.

2168
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:05,830
Definitely.
Remember Larry used to have coke around 

2169
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:07,910
just anybody spot.
No one knows who larry is.

2170
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:08,930
The cable guy.

2171
01:31:11,150 --> 01:31:16,150
That's one thing I've never fuck with 
and I'm very glad I never tried that 

2172
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:16,150
shit.
Never fucked with it.

2173
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:17,360
I knew too many people that had real 
problems with it.

2174
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,700
I've done coke maybe five times in my 
whole life.

2175
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:23,120
Maybe three to five times sucks.
Scary pussies.

2176
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,460
They say you got to get that Rockstar 
Cook.

2177
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:28,820
That's what a Tom Sawyer from cobb's in 
San Francisco.

2178
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:31,250
He's always saying you got to get that 
Rockstar Coke Shit.

2179
01:31:31,251 --> 01:31:32,780
I read somewhere.
Something about coke.

2180
01:31:32,810 --> 01:31:36,080
How there's bad coke going around now 
that like will eat your skin.

2181
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:41,110
Like it has some kind of fucking 
chemical in it that just starts burning 

2182
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:41,110
your skin.
Fuck,

2183
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:43,010
I don't know.
I ain't got a google list now.

2184
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,080
Bad cocaine.
What was it?

2185
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,650
What you were telling me about tylenol?
What the fuck is going on with?

2186
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:50,570
So there was,
if you try to get tylenol right now,

2187
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:55,571
I guess there's this huge tylenol like 
where they pulled it from the store 

2188
01:31:55,571 --> 01:31:58,541
shelves and what's crazy is that I did 
some research on it and it seems like a.

2189
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,250
So they

2190
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:05,250
did all these like things where they 
went to the factories were tylenol is 

2191
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:07,990
made and they found a like,
like a bacteria inside tylenol.

2192
01:32:07,991 --> 01:32:12,370
They found like the chemicals that were 
being made to make tunnel were off.

2193
01:32:12,371 --> 01:32:15,310
Like there was too much of one chemical 
and not enough of another chemical.

2194
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:17,500
So it could possibly have got,
you know,

2195
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:22,590
made kid's sick and so they,
they pulled off tylenol off the shelves 

2196
01:32:22,590 --> 01:32:25,140
I guess,
but then the other day a monitor,

2197
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:30,720
there was this report that came out,
there was this report that came out 

2198
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:31,750
that,
that Johnson and Johnson,

2199
01:32:31,751 --> 01:32:33,310
the company that owns tylenol or 
whatever,

2200
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:38,430
hired this third party company from San 
Diego to act like customers and then go 

2201
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:41,440
into grocery stores and buy all this one
product off the shelf.

2202
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:45,460
Like they're doing a phantom recall,
meaning they didn't want to tell anybody

2203
01:32:45,461 --> 01:32:46,690
or anyone to know.

2204
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:48,910
So they hired a company to go into 
grocery stores,

2205
01:32:48,911 --> 01:32:51,160
into pharmacies to take this product off
your shelf.

2206
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,230
And then they got caught and then a 
month later they,

2207
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,910
they recalled,
uh,

2208
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:57,260
this other drug.
It's just like Tylenol,

2209
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:02,280
I forget the name of it,
but it was like another one and they're 

2210
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:02,380
like kids tylenol or something like 
that.

2211
01:33:02,381 --> 01:33:04,450
How much have you looked into this?
Seriously?

2212
01:33:04,451 --> 01:33:06,670
It was like a half hour today.
I just read around today,

2213
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:11,910
but a tylenol Johnson Johnson was 
supposed to give over to the FDA like 

2214
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:16,021
this report about their findings and 
stuff like that and they missed the 

2215
01:33:16,021 --> 01:33:20,101
deadline.
I think the deadline was yesterday or 

2216
01:33:20,101 --> 01:33:22,021
two days ago.
They missed the deadlines is something 

2217
01:33:22,021 --> 01:33:22,270
might be up at Tylenol,
so if you have any tylenol from 2008,

2218
01:33:22,271 --> 01:33:24,700
you might want to go check it out,
throw it away or do whatever you have to

2219
01:33:24,701 --> 01:33:29,701
do.
Because there was another report I was 

2220
01:33:29,701 --> 01:33:30,280
reading as say something like there was 
30 deaths related to tylenol in the last

2221
01:33:30,281 --> 01:33:32,680
two years and they don't know if that's 
connected or not either.

2222
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:35,020
So I don't know.
Google search,

2223
01:33:35,021 --> 01:33:40,021
tylenol recall.
There's some crazy shit going on with 

2224
01:33:40,021 --> 01:33:40,021
some tylenol right now.
Wow.

2225
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:45,070
They're saying that the pharmacist that 
we were at today said that there might 

2226
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:45,070
not be tying on until 2011.

2227
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,850
Damn.
Who is fuck.

2228
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:52,890
Who's who got in trouble for cyanide?
They're saying there's potential 

2229
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:52,960
criminal charges and indictments.
Yeah,

2230
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:54,100
that's what they're saying about 
tylenol.

2231
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:54,440
Yeah,

2232
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,980
and it's crazy because you pay extra for
Tylenol,

2233
01:33:57,981 --> 01:33:58,450
you know,
your,

2234
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:03,500
your tunnels,
like more expensive than like the 

2235
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:03,500
average brand.
Right.

2236
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:07,211
And you would think that they would have
their shit together a little bit better 

2237
01:34:07,211 --> 01:34:07,211
than fucking

2238
01:34:07,211 --> 01:34:07,211
buffering first.
Toyota.

2239
01:34:07,211 --> 01:34:10,770
Now this,
what's next fucking cup of color.

2240
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,080
Imagine that.
Well,

2241
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:17,100
as the economy starts to fuck up,
as people start to make less and less 

2242
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:17,170
money,
you're gonna see more and more problems.

2243
01:34:17,171 --> 01:34:20,470
I'm sure less and less research is going
to be done less and less,

2244
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,510
you know,
fail safe measures.

2245
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:24,760
Did you watch the last comic standing 
last night?

2246
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:26,480
No.
No,

2247
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,440
I gave up on that show a long time ago.
I didn't watch it,

2248
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,500
but I heard it was okay.
Wow.

2249
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:34,720
Fucking fascinating.
Yeah.

2250
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:35,860
Yeah.
Last comic standing,

2251
01:34:35,861 --> 01:34:36,210
man,
I,

2252
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:41,240
I just don't like the fact that they 
make them sit in a room and do standup 

2253
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:41,970
comedy for three people.
You know,

2254
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:44,920
that to me it's just like what?
That's how they're going to audition.

2255
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:50,280
They're going to stand in front of three
people and one of them was going to try 

2256
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,471
to pretend that there Simon,
is that what happens ones runs really 

2257
01:34:52,471 --> 01:34:52,471
mean.
Is that how they do it?

2258
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:56,710
If you got a tremendous migraine 
headache and you had,

2259
01:34:56,830 --> 01:34:58,550
you only had two things,
tylenol

2260
01:34:58,730 --> 01:34:59,920
or cocaine,
what would you do?

2261
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:04,550
You trust cocaine that you don't even 
know where it came from.

2262
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:08,030
It could come from some fucking greasy 
immigrant.

2263
01:35:08,330 --> 01:35:11,990
He going to trust cocaine for a nice 
American name brand like Tylenol,

2264
01:35:11,991 --> 01:35:13,340
so they made a few mistakes.
Brian,

2265
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:15,130
how many good pills they put out?
Huh?

2266
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:20,290
Millions and millions and millions of 
people all across the world have had 

2267
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:21,980
relieved headaches because of tylenol 
and you want to hate because they fucked

2268
01:35:21,981 --> 01:35:23,630
up a little bit here and there.
That's deep.

2269
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:24,740
Come on,
man.

2270
01:35:24,741 --> 01:35:29,741
That's deep.
Tylenol doesn't get you laid cocaine 

2271
01:35:29,741 --> 01:35:29,741
does.
Wow.

2272
01:35:29,741 --> 01:35:33,150
Just got a good point for your baby.
If you crush up tylenol,

2273
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:35,480
the powder like joey does,
that'll get you laid.

2274
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:38,000
The girls that you can only fucked 
because you're giving them coke.

2275
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:43,030
You really shouldn't fuck them.
What models know the fucking people 

2276
01:35:44,391 --> 01:35:45,800
don't really want to fuck you.

2277
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:48,610
That's what I'm saying is,
you know they fucked the tylenol.

2278
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:50,300
You should only fucked girls who want to
fuck you.

2279
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:52,610
You shouldn't fuck girls who want to 
fuck you for coke.

2280
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:54,670
I mean you got to do what you gotta do 
it.

2281
01:35:54,671 --> 01:35:56,720
That's the only way you can get laid.
I understand your position.

2282
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:59,240
I got cocaine or got my personality.
Which one do you want?

2283
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:04,250
Maybe if you have two possibilities.
One fucking girls who actually wanna 

2284
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:08,750
fuck you.
And two fucking girls that you can only 

2285
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:08,750
fuck because you give them drugs.
I would say go with number one.

2286
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:09,560
Yeah,
right?

2287
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,650
Yeah.
Everybody wants the person who's fucking

2288
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:16,660
them to like the fuck them.
Nobody wants to be fucking some cooked 

2289
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:19,751
up checkers.
She's got her half an eye on the 

2290
01:36:19,751 --> 01:36:19,780
nightstand at all times.
Looking over at that mirror while you're

2291
01:36:19,781 --> 01:36:21,410
banging her.
Just wants another line.

2292
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:24,080
Yeah,
but what if you're noise with the chick?

2293
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:26,060
You just want her to fuck out,
but you want to drop it.

2294
01:36:26,061 --> 01:36:27,790
Load first.
Then coax.

2295
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,600
Perfect.
I guess,

2296
01:36:29,601 --> 01:36:31,700
but doesn't she want more coke?
There isn't that.

2297
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:33,410
The thing about coke is never get rid of
them.

2298
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,160
There'll be cool for like two hours.
You can.

2299
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:37,880
You give them a little bit and they'll 
think it's enough.

2300
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:43,140
You just give them the token.
Tell them to leave with some coke and 

2301
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:43,140
you're telling Yo meet him at the club 
and you got more coke.

2302
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:43,430
You're gonna.
Bring all the coke.

2303
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:49,780
Who has.
Who has more aspirin stories that joey 

2304
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:51,020
did.
Fucking crushed up aspirin.

2305
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:53,540
Tell us a joey story.
Let me tell you something.

2306
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:54,890
There was this one time.
This chick was like,

2307
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:57,380
I just need to get a line.
Like I just need to get my dick sucked.

2308
01:36:57,710 --> 01:37:00,680
What a coincidence.
So we go back to my place.

2309
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:02,840
I'm telling US pitch.
I got the best fucking coke ever.

2310
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:05,480
This shit's coming straight from Pablo 
Escobar.

2311
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:10,660
He deliberated himself.
It came over on a fucking donkey with 

2312
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:12,020
some bread and a fact pack of coke.
Hold on honey.

2313
01:37:12,021 --> 01:37:12,920
I'm going to get it.
I'll be right back.

2314
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:17,950
I went into the bathroom.
I started fucking chopping up all these 

2315
01:37:17,950 --> 01:37:20,321
different pieces of fight of his fight 
up and fucking be fucking talcum powder 

2316
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:23,060
and shit.
I laid a couple of lines.

2317
01:37:23,150 --> 01:37:28,150
I stuck it in her mouth.
I shot off a load before she even knew 

2318
01:37:28,150 --> 01:37:28,150
what hit her.
I was gone.

2319
01:37:28,150 --> 01:37:28,470
You know what I'm saying,
Dawg?

2320
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:31,280
Fuck.
Oh Shit.

2321
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:34,280
We gotta get out of here.
I realized the cops are coming at noon.

2322
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:37,460
Run.
I got to the fucking front.

2323
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:40,700
I got in my car.
I told her take a left at the light.

2324
01:37:40,701 --> 01:37:43,250
I'll meet you down the street.
I took a right fuck her.

2325
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:45,800
I'm gone.
I got on the freeway.

2326
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:49,490
Got Off the first exit.
Fuck you.

2327
01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:54,550
I when away to whip ponies dead.
Nice.

2328
01:37:55,800 --> 01:38:00,800
That's a good job.
Joey Diaz and pressure like such a good 

2329
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:00,800
impression.
Okay.

2330
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:01,830
Review reviews.
Joey.

2331
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:04,140
Joey,
what do you think about this whole,

2332
01:38:04,150 --> 01:38:06,180
uh,
a cat piss thing?

2333
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:10,920
The parents.
That's a soft spot in my heart.

2334
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:12,330
You know,
I got cats,

2335
01:38:12,331 --> 01:38:13,350
you know,
I love him to death.

2336
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:18,970
But the bottom line is I'm an asshole 
and I live with a bunch of fucking cats.

2337
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,330
I think he's probably got it totally,
totally,

2338
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:24,510
totally,
totally brings in cats from outside.

2339
01:38:24,530 --> 01:38:26,700
Yeah.
He brings in like monster cats.

2340
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:28,620
Like remember he was always talking 
about the Samurai that,

2341
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:32,340
that at the big scars all over his face.
That's a wild tomcat.

2342
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:37,520
He is one of the guys that's a grown 
adult that subscribes to cat fancy 

2343
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,180
magazine that actually keeps that 
magazine in business,

2344
01:38:39,181 --> 01:38:43,260
which I can't believe cat.
Fancy still has a drive to cat.

2345
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:44,300
Fancy.
Yeah.

2346
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:45,930
But then you get like real magazine,
so you know,

2347
01:38:45,931 --> 01:38:50,931
like whatever Time magazine or whatever 
that they're hurting because of the 

2348
01:38:50,931 --> 01:38:50,931
economy by yet.
Cat Fancy.

2349
01:38:50,931 --> 01:38:55,120
Julia would freak out if we wouldn't 
watch that DVD and I don't think you'd 

2350
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,550
read that article.
You'd have to show them a documentary on

2351
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:59,370
the cat parasite.
Have to be a documentary.

2352
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:01,560
Are you concerned at all about the oil 
spill or anything?

2353
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:04,650
How does that affect your life?
Directly effects me because I think it's

2354
01:39:04,651 --> 01:39:05,960
going to be.
Oh,

2355
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:07,900
oh.
I was like,

2356
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,990
where the fuck's this?
You listen to any Bravo look at me.

2357
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:17,030
Do I look like a look like I get in the 
fucking ocean and sharks?

2358
01:39:17,370 --> 01:39:19,890
What am I fucking Cock sucker.
Listen,

2359
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:21,160
this is what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna.

2360
01:39:21,170 --> 01:39:23,260
Walk down to the weed store.
I'm going to roll a joint.

2361
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:27,900
Say a prayer to the mother.
Fucking clean this shit up.

2362
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,730
If not,
I guess I'm not going swimming.

2363
01:39:33,490 --> 01:39:34,770
What did he say?
What the fuck?

2364
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:39,360
I got enough problems in my own life.
Give a fuck about a greasy Pelican.

2365
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:41,100
You got oil on you.
You Fuck?

2366
01:39:41,790 --> 01:39:42,900
Oh Man.
Oh Shit.

2367
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:45,060
Fly Away motherfucker.
You got wings.

2368
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:46,740
You're gonna.
Sit there and let the oil hit Ya.

2369
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:51,120
Fuck you.
You finally got texting about six months

2370
01:39:51,121 --> 01:39:51,840
ago.
You're by.

2371
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,340
You're busting my balls that he 
probably.

2372
01:39:53,410 --> 01:39:55,920
You think about the iphone and the 
camera and all that shit.

2373
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:59,210
You're going to go into the iphone now.
I do.

2374
01:39:59,211 --> 01:40:02,160
You think Julie would go into the iphone
but I don't know.

2375
01:40:02,161 --> 01:40:04,560
You tell me he wants an iphone back.
Listen,

2376
01:40:04,561 --> 01:40:05,830
no,
he's too old school for that.

2377
01:40:05,850 --> 01:40:07,970
Now he wants to iphone.
He just got a iphone.

2378
01:40:07,971 --> 01:40:08,370
Uh,
you know,

2379
01:40:08,371 --> 01:40:10,200
like one of those phones that are acting
like the iphone,

2380
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:15,180
he did sprint,
iphone,

2381
01:40:15,790 --> 01:40:17,070
some sprint,
sprint.

2382
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:18,240
He was supposed to be here.

2383
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:19,920
This with Joe.
We're going to get an iphone.

2384
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:22,590
He would.
Eddie Bravo.

2385
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:24,660
Listen to me.
I'm old school.

2386
01:40:25,050 --> 01:40:27,440
I barely,
barely get on that fucking thing to text

2387
01:40:27,441 --> 01:40:27,900
to you.
Me,

2388
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:31,950
you think I'm going to get there and 
we'll get a fucking do apps together.

2389
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:35,520
Oh,
let's play donkey Kong will fucking come

2390
01:40:35,521 --> 01:40:40,521
on.
Get online with my laptop through your 

2391
01:40:40,521 --> 01:40:42,591
asshole.
And you're gonna fucking connected with 

2392
01:40:42,591 --> 01:40:44,431
a USB cable.
I don't need all this nonsense in my 

2393
01:40:44,431 --> 01:40:44,820
life.
I don't need all this aggravation to the

2394
01:40:44,821 --> 01:40:47,220
weed store.
I'm going to roll a joint.

2395
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:50,170
Walk down to the fucking store.
Alright.

2396
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:53,130
I'm not hurting nobody.
I'm not bothering nobody.

2397
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:53,880
Did you?
Did your.

2398
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:55,030
We'd start close.
No,

2399
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,200
no.
My closing.

2400
01:40:57,730 --> 01:41:02,730
They're closer.
A bunch because they're too close to 

2401
01:41:02,730 --> 01:41:02,920
churches.
Parks or schools.

2402
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:05,740
You have to be within a certain feet 
from a church.

2403
01:41:05,770 --> 01:41:06,910
A Parker school.

2404
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,790
I don't know how many it is,
but it's like a thousand or some shit,

2405
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:14,080
which is pretty pretty far.
I checked all my places and none of them

2406
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:19,081
are closing so that you can't be near a 
park because that's where all the 

2407
01:41:19,081 --> 01:41:20,890
illegal dealers.
It's almost like the illegal dealers got

2408
01:41:20,891 --> 01:41:22,280
in on the action.
Yeah,

2409
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:26,620
probably at the top of the weed 
movement.

2410
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:31,820
And like,
especially the guys that own the most 

2411
01:41:31,820 --> 01:41:34,291
successful at dispensary's,
I think they'd like these stores that 

2412
01:41:34,291 --> 01:41:36,850
have been rated guys fuck up when 
they're going against the,

2413
01:41:36,851 --> 01:41:39,610
uh,
the regulations is we had a conversation

2414
01:41:39,611 --> 01:41:42,610
with a,
a idleman because we got our,

2415
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:44,560
uh,
you're right,

2416
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:49,060
there is radio,
the um,

2417
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:49,850
uh,
the,

2418
01:41:49,851 --> 01:41:50,220
you know,
the,

2419
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:51,450
the,
uh,

2420
01:41:51,490 --> 01:41:56,490
the dog,
he went to jail for it and an item and 

2421
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:56,980
was talking about the November election 
and were like,

2422
01:41:56,981 --> 01:41:59,230
you know,
if this stuff becomes legal in November,

2423
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:00,040
like,
what are you going to do?

2424
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:02,950
You're not going to be able to give out 
prescriptions anymore.

2425
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:03,840
And he's like,
yeah,

2426
01:42:03,841 --> 01:42:06,040
well it's actually kind of a dilemma for
me.

2427
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,020
Like,
wait a minute,

2428
01:42:08,270 --> 01:42:09,700
what are we doing?
If that guy,

2429
01:42:09,701 --> 01:42:12,190
if we became legal,
his whole business shuts down.

2430
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:17,280
What the fuck is you do?
Then that's a tricky situation for a 

2431
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:17,280
week,
Dr.

2432
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,240
man,
it's gonna be wild.

2433
01:42:19,241 --> 01:42:24,241
If it gets through though,
if it gets through in California and it 

2434
01:42:24,241 --> 01:42:26,080
becomes absolutely legal,
it's gonna be fucking crazy.

2435
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:29,950
It's going to really change the culture 
here because people realize how much has

2436
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:32,380
changed the culture since medical 
marijuana became legal,

2437
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:36,100
but that's just the beginning man.
When when it becomes legal legal,

2438
01:42:36,101 --> 01:42:41,101
when it comes,
you know a personal use issue when you 

2439
01:42:41,101 --> 01:42:43,621
just have to be over 21,
you just go to the fucking corner 

2440
01:42:43,621 --> 01:42:44,200
drugstore and they're selling weed or 
selling weed everywhere.

2441
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:45,630
It's going to change things,
man.

2442
01:42:45,790 --> 01:42:47,440
They're going to start selling weed at 
bars.

2443
01:42:47,530 --> 01:42:49,930
They're going to have weed,
smoking sections at bars for sure.

2444
01:42:49,931 --> 01:42:52,570
They'll have like a back patio where you
can smoke weed.

2445
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:57,070
It's gonna be nuts when they allow you 
to buy a joint at a movie theater,

2446
01:42:57,071 --> 01:43:02,071
like at the arc light smoke because they
have like a movie theater designated 

2447
01:43:02,071 --> 01:43:06,540
with a bar.
You have to be 21 to get into this 

2448
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:06,540
theater at the top.
They're going to have a weed there.

2449
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,230
That's what.
That's what the problem is.

2450
01:43:08,231 --> 01:43:11,530
You can't even smoke cigarettes indoors 
because it's a personal.

2451
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:14,290
It's other people's health that you get 
to choose.

2452
01:43:14,810 --> 01:43:17,050
You get to choose,
you get to choose.

2453
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:19,510
They don't let that.
Don't let that happen in.

2454
01:43:19,511 --> 01:43:21,370
In California,
you can't even smoke at a bar.

2455
01:43:21,371 --> 01:43:24,190
It's not even an option.
You have to go to a cigar bar.

2456
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:26,830
I,
I belong to a cigar bar in beverly hills

2457
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:30,340
and you go there.
Yeah,

2458
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:35,440
but so god bars like a bunch of stuffy,
rich dudes and it's got a thousand 

2459
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:38,290
dollars a year.
Something like that.

2460
01:43:38,291 --> 01:43:40,480
Maybe more.
That's the gayest thing I've ever heard.

2461
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:45,540
You take a failed cigar bar.
The licensing for smoke Brian and 

2462
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:46,180
convert it into weed barn.
I don't know.

2463
01:43:46,181 --> 01:43:48,970
I wonder how many cigar bars there are a
bunch of cigar stores.

2464
01:43:48,971 --> 01:43:50,320
Alicia,
small right next to the Improv.

2465
01:43:50,321 --> 01:43:51,950
This one vending everywhere.

2466
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:55,670
That's what you would have.
Like a store that lets you smoke there

2467
01:43:55,810 --> 01:44:00,810
and in Canada they got spots.
It's weird because in Canada you can't 

2468
01:44:00,810 --> 01:44:01,150
buy the weed there if you're going to 
smoke,

2469
01:44:01,151 --> 01:44:02,950
but they have places where you can smoke
weed.

2470
01:44:02,951 --> 01:44:04,630
You've got to bring your own shit in 
Vancouver,

2471
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:09,960
Vancouver,
and in Toronto there's places where the 

2472
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:14,220
bottom floor is a restaurant and like a 
snack bar cafe.

2473
01:44:14,470 --> 01:44:19,470
And then you rent these rooms.
There's rooms like as big as this giant 

2474
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:19,470
screen tv,
xbox,

2475
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:20,770
playstation,
dvds,

2476
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:22,030
couches.

2477
01:44:22,330 --> 01:44:22,690
Well,
you know,

2478
01:44:22,691 --> 01:44:26,320
who's taken us coover.
We're going to Vancouver this weekend by

2479
01:44:26,321 --> 01:44:27,140
the way.
Yeah,

2480
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,540
we Friday night.
Um,

2481
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:32,300
if you want to come,
I'm hanging out with Adam score.

2482
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:35,080
Gee,
the guy who produced the union and uh,

2483
01:44:35,081 --> 01:44:40,081
we're gonna do another documentary 
together and one of the things that 

2484
01:44:40,081 --> 01:44:43,370
we're going to do is dispel a lot of the
myths about people being lazy and uh,

2485
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:48,700
you know,
marijuana smokers being lazy and how 

2486
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:48,970
much propaganda has been distributed to 
people about marijuana making you lazy.

2487
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:52,720
And one of the things I want to do is 
feature your school and feature,

2488
01:44:52,721 --> 01:44:57,721
you know,
you teaching and you how many times 

2489
01:44:57,721 --> 01:44:57,721
you've done this,
where you teach class,

2490
01:44:57,721 --> 01:44:57,721
you go,
how many guys are high,

2491
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:01,900
like 30 dudes who raise their hands.
And I don't think I've,

2492
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:05,440
I've taught a night class,
not stone.

2493
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:07,120
They classes too.
I go and stone too,

2494
01:45:07,121 --> 01:45:09,430
but I used to not get high for the day 
classes,

2495
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:12,310
but night class,
I mean my classes are at 8:30

2496
01:45:12,311 --> 01:45:12,760
at night.

2497
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:18,120
There's,
there's no way I'm going to get to that 

2498
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:18,120
class and not be stone,
you know?

2499
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:18,120
Yeah.
And you know,

2500
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,260
there was one of the things that came up
in the UFC q and a.

2501
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:25,740
They asked me about weed and about 
whether or not I think weed is an 

2502
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:26,410
enhancer,
a physical enhancement,

2503
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:31,650
you know,
whether or not I think that it's a 

2504
01:45:31,650 --> 01:45:34,110
performance enhancer and this guy said 
that he thinks it is and he was talking 

2505
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:34,870
about him doing Jujitsu and I said,
I agree.

2506
01:45:34,871 --> 01:45:36,130
I think it is.
I go,

2507
01:45:36,131 --> 01:45:38,410
I feel like when I'm.
When I'm stoned and I did Jujitsu,

2508
01:45:38,411 --> 01:45:40,630
I feel like I focus more.
I can see it clearly.

2509
01:45:40,870 --> 01:45:41,380
I'm,
I'm,

2510
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:42,150
I'm,
I'm more,

2511
01:45:42,151 --> 01:45:44,260
I have more tunnel vision as to what I'm
doing.

2512
01:45:44,261 --> 01:45:45,730
My movements are more precise.

2513
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,570
Yeah.
There's so many Jujitsu players.

2514
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:50,380
I mean,
I'm sure in all sports,

2515
01:45:50,390 --> 01:45:53,340
the same thing in basketball,
but you just bought huge too for sure.

2516
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:58,370
There's so many pop jujitsu players that
are stoned out of their fucking minds 

2517
01:45:58,381 --> 01:46:00,390
when they roll,
including the Diaz brothers.

2518
01:46:00,391 --> 01:46:03,330
They admitted Bj Penn.
There's no,

2519
01:46:03,331 --> 01:46:05,160
and then when people come one guys and 
it goes,

2520
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:08,940
and then they say that it cuts down on 
your reaction time.

2521
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,860
That's impossible.
If anything,

2522
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:15,570
if you're doing jujitsu and your 
reaction time is slowed down in any way,

2523
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:18,210
your jujitsu is going to suck.
Totally.

2524
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:23,240
Just there's no way you can do anything 
that's going to slow your reaction time 

2525
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,690
and be really good at it.
It doesn't work that way.

2526
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:29,780
There's no way you can have slow 
reactions like when you know there's a 

2527
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:30,930
reason why rappers always get high.
When they wrap their flowing,

2528
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:33,480
they got a million words a minute coming
out of their mouth.

2529
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:35,680
There can't be any slow reaction time.
Yeah.

2530
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:36,780
A,
it's a myth.

2531
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:40,340
There's no slowing.
It doesn't slow anything down.

2532
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:43,430
It's a not at all the mikes on different
levels.

2533
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:45,200
people are complaining to on different 
levels.

2534
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:50,230
I turned yours up.
I took yours down when you were doing 

2535
01:46:50,230 --> 01:46:50,370
the job ads because it was okay.
Yeah,

2536
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:51,960
dude,
it doesn't slow you down at all.

2537
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:53,910
People that say it does or silly,
it's,

2538
01:46:53,911 --> 01:46:54,300
it's,
uh,

2539
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:59,410
if,
if anything it just puts you in a 

2540
01:46:59,410 --> 01:47:02,121
different state of mind.
It puts you in a very creative state of 

2541
01:47:02,121 --> 01:47:02,121
mind.
If,

2542
01:47:02,121 --> 01:47:06,140
if it wasn't for pot,
I would say 80 percent of my material 

2543
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:10,401
would be different.
I think 80 percent of the things that I 

2544
01:47:10,401 --> 01:47:13,641
write,
I write while I'm high and that's being 

2545
01:47:13,641 --> 01:47:13,641
very conservative because it could 
easily,

2546
01:47:13,641 --> 01:47:16,440
could be 90 percent,
can be 90 percent of all the things that

2547
01:47:16,441 --> 01:47:18,570
I write,
I write under the influence of marijuana

2548
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:20,730
and I think if it wasn't for the 
marijuana,

2549
01:47:20,731 --> 01:47:22,650
I think the material would be different.

2550
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:26,580
It's much like that fucking cat parasite
changes the way people behave.

2551
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:31,760
Marijuana changes the way you behave,
but it changes it in a good way 

2552
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:31,980
sometimes.
Sometimes.

2553
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:37,440
There's been many times where I've been 
stone where I look back at shit I have 

2554
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:37,440
thought or done while I was stoned.
I'm like,

2555
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,540
what the fuck was I thinking?
Like what?

2556
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:44,690
All the time.
Usually when it comes to like making 

2557
01:47:44,690 --> 01:47:45,870
videos or just anything,
it doesn't give you great ideas.

2558
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:48,540
It just gives you more of the energy to 
do the ideas,

2559
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,550
more ideas that you would already come 
up with,

2560
01:47:50,551 --> 01:47:52,470
but you're getting them all at once and 
everything is.

2561
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:54,720
Everything is supercharged and it's 
really fast.

2562
01:47:54,810 --> 01:47:56,520
It doesn't.
That makes dumb people smart.

2563
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:59,460
It depends on a bunch of things.
Depends on first of all how high you get

2564
01:47:59,550 --> 01:48:03,630
because if you get too high and you can 
get too high where everything spirals in

2565
01:48:03,631 --> 01:48:04,820
front of you and it becomes like.

2566
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:10,100
IT's like you have millions of dollars 
flying around you but you're in the 

2567
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:11,010
middle of a tornado and you can't grab 
any of it.

2568
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:16,310
You know,
and sometimes you get to that super 

2569
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:19,071
paranoid super high state and like 
that's not manageable and you have to 

2570
01:48:19,071 --> 01:48:21,810
wait until you come down from that super
high to a more manageable place.

2571
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:26,930
Then you can become creatIve.
Then you sit down and write and you can 

2572
01:48:26,930 --> 01:48:29,661
keep a thought going and you,
you say that like maybe sometimes pots 

2573
01:48:29,661 --> 01:48:34,521
made you make shitty decisions,
but that's just making you take chances 

2574
01:48:34,521 --> 01:48:35,130
when you're sober,
you know,

2575
01:48:35,131 --> 01:48:36,780
and you go back and you look at it,
you know,

2576
01:48:36,781 --> 01:48:41,781
maybe you're just not seeing it in the 
way that you were seeing it then and 

2577
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:41,781
there wasn't complete,
you know,

2578
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:43,080
do,
you didn't fight a complete division.

2579
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:48,380
But look at how much cool shit that you 
have created from pot pot has been 

2580
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:50,700
responsible for a lot of your really 
good editing too,

2581
01:48:50,701 --> 01:48:51,240
don't you think?

2582
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:52,470
Yeah,
definitely.

2583
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:54,570
But I mean,
I'm just saying,

2584
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:58,170
I'm just saying it's not 100 percent,
like nothing's 100 percent,

2585
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:03,320
but you gotta remember you want it,
you want to keep track of all that dumb 

2586
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:04,230
ideas you come up with not stoned and 
then compare.

2587
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:09,470
Right.
That's also what's your state of mind 

2588
01:49:09,470 --> 01:49:09,470
too?
It's like,

2589
01:49:09,470 --> 01:49:10,320
how are you coming to the creative 
table?

2590
01:49:10,350 --> 01:49:15,350
Are you coming to the table tired?
Are you coming to the table in a good 

2591
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:15,350
mood?
You know,

2592
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:16,140
I could have some personal issues going 
on,

2593
01:49:16,141 --> 01:49:18,170
I could have some things that are 
bothering me or some,

2594
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:23,210
some unfinished business that I need to 
get taken care of before my mind can be 

2595
01:49:23,210 --> 01:49:24,390
a piece and then you get high and then 
you don't have a good reaction,

2596
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:27,690
but you could be in the best state and 
when I'm in the best state,

2597
01:49:27,691 --> 01:49:32,691
when I'm feeling the best that I'm the 
most loose and my mind feels free and 

2598
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:33,790
I'm happy and I'm positive and then I 
get high.

2599
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:36,420
Then she Just feels like it all just 
tunes in.

2600
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:41,660
then I feel like I'm wide open to the 
point where there's nothing that's 

2601
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:41,660
bothering me,
nothing that's,

2602
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:46,100
that's tightening me up.
So I'm wide open and loose and then the 

2603
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:48,190
weed hits and it's just like,
it just washes you in this crazy energy.

2604
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:53,430
It just hits you with this blast of 
light perception in this new way of 

2605
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:54,040
seeing things that,
you know,

2606
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:59,640
it sometimes can fuck you up.
But I think when even when it fucks you 

2607
01:49:59,640 --> 01:49:59,640
up,
like there's lessons in that shit.

2608
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:04,531
There's lessons in why it fucked you up.
There's lessons in where your head was 

2609
01:50:04,531 --> 01:50:05,110
at when you weren't in the right place.
You know,

2610
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:06,970
it's just,
it needs to be fucking.

2611
01:50:07,210 --> 01:50:09,820
Someone needs to teach us how to do it.
That's what it is.

2612
01:50:09,821 --> 01:50:12,790
It's a very complicated thing using any 
entheogens,

2613
01:50:12,791 --> 01:50:14,470
losing marijuana,
using mushrooms.

2614
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:20,100
There should be people that are 
professionals that can talk people 

2615
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:23,851
through the use of these things.
Like how you were talking last week 

2616
01:50:23,851 --> 01:50:24,700
about the shermans and fuck yeah man,
we need that.

2617
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:27,430
We need that.
If we had that with,

2618
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:32,520
I hope that's something that comes out 
of this whole marijuana legalization 

2619
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:32,520
thing.
I hope you know,

2620
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,180
marijuana therapy therapy for people 
that,

2621
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:34,870
you know,
look,

2622
01:50:34,871 --> 01:50:36,880
people need gambling therapy.
You don't,

2623
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:37,990
I don't,
you know,

2624
01:50:37,991 --> 01:50:42,991
we can gamble and quit and so big deal,
but some people get knocked up on 

2625
01:50:42,991 --> 01:50:46,501
gambling.
They had fucked up and they can't stop 

2626
01:50:46,501 --> 01:50:47,740
gambling and I think there needs to be a
therapy for weed people too.

2627
01:50:47,741 --> 01:50:52,741
For some people that Just get fucked up 
on weed and it's really just therapy 

2628
01:50:52,741 --> 01:50:52,741
they need,
you know,

2629
01:50:52,741 --> 01:50:55,590
most of these addictions,
addiction to masturbation,

2630
01:50:55,600 --> 01:51:00,600
addiction.
These are all psychological addictions 

2631
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:00,600
are not physical addictions,
but they're still there,

2632
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:05,040
so they're going to have to have that.
They're gonna have to have therapy for 

2633
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:05,040
people to get fucked up on.
We'd,

2634
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:09,020
you know,
if we want to keep it healthy society 

2635
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:10,861
during the transition,
but it's no different than therapy for 

2636
01:51:10,861 --> 01:51:10,861
guys that cheat on their wives for 
therapy,

2637
01:51:10,861 --> 01:51:15,841
for,
for masturbation or therapy for 

2638
01:51:15,841 --> 01:51:15,841
anything.
It's like you just got an error,

2639
01:51:15,841 --> 01:51:15,841
right

2640
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:17,970

2673
01:52:22,711 --> 01:52:27,711
Even the name 10th planet.
Jujitsu is all from the zechariah 

2674
01:52:27,711 --> 01:52:27,711
stories.
Yeah,

2675
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:32,400
that's funny thing about 10th planet jiu
jitsu was I decided to,

2676
01:52:32,401 --> 01:52:34,410
uh,
when I first decided to open the school,

2677
01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:39,650
I needed a name for the school.
I needed a name for the style and I 

2678
01:52:39,650 --> 01:52:42,060
wanted something.
I definitely wanted something in the,

2679
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:46,120
in a style I want it.
I was thinking nibiru

2680
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:51,190
to did.
I was actually thinking that it's like 

2681
01:52:51,190 --> 01:52:53,390
nibiru jujitsu.
Will people get that something I knock 

2682
01:52:53,390 --> 01:52:53,390
you jujitsu or something.
Joe goes,

2683
01:52:53,390 --> 01:52:53,800
right.
We were en route.

2684
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:58,840
We're entering your security gate.
You said why not just 10th planet jiu 

2685
01:52:58,840 --> 01:52:59,280
jitsu stupid.
No,

2686
01:52:59,290 --> 01:52:59,570
no,
no.

2687
01:52:59,580 --> 01:53:04,580
Something like rocky sitch.
And you thought about a 10th planet 

2688
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:06,380
jujitsu,
huh?

2689
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:08,770
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.

2690
01:53:08,771 --> 01:53:11,020
Fuck yeah,
that's it right there.

2691
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:12,710
Fuck me bro.
Jujitsu.

2692
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:13,670
That sounds good.

2693
01:53:14,610 --> 01:53:15,560
You know,
um,

2694
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:20,660
we're,
we're good friends and so I don't 

2695
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:20,770
necessarily talk about you too much just
because you know,

2696
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:22,470
I kind of take it for granted because 
we're good friends,

2697
01:53:22,710 --> 01:53:27,710
but I've done the forward to two of your
books and we've been friends for 10 

2698
01:53:28,051 --> 01:53:29,070
years now.
Like strong.

2699
01:53:29,370 --> 01:53:34,370
And the weirdest thing about this whole 
a jujitsu thing is watching it blossom 

2700
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:41,540
out of just hanging out when you were a 
purple belt and just talking about 

2701
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:46,011
different techniques to now this nobody 
fucking thing where you've got 

2702
01:53:46,011 --> 01:53:50,181
affiliates all over the world and other 
countries and shit and you're traveling 

2703
01:53:50,181 --> 01:53:52,320
all over the world doing seminars and 
teaching people this shit.

2704
01:53:52,590 --> 01:53:57,590
All the while it's this weird 
combination of like stoner sensibility 

2705
01:53:58,201 --> 01:54:01,650
and openminded creative jujitsu and you 
know,

2706
01:54:01,651 --> 01:54:05,130
even the fucking name is hilarious.
10th planet jujitsu.

2707
01:54:05,131 --> 01:54:06,330
There's something.
I mean,

2708
01:54:06,690 --> 01:54:09,910
this is like some crazy alien,
you know,

2709
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:11,730
hybrid system,
you know,

2710
01:54:11,731 --> 01:54:12,390
the,
the whole,

2711
01:54:12,391 --> 01:54:17,391
the whole thing is in the world of 
martial arts is a very unexpected to 

2712
01:54:17,391 --> 01:54:19,050
have someone who's got this sort of 
silly,

2713
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:23,440
like goofy outlook on so many different 
things and,

2714
01:54:23,441 --> 01:54:28,441
and,
and has got a sense of humor about so 

2715
01:54:28,441 --> 01:54:30,231
many different things and smokes weed 
and it was always playing pranks on 

2716
01:54:30,231 --> 01:54:31,470
people like prank people all the time.

2717
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:33,390
Well,
people don't know where's the best place

2718
01:54:33,391 --> 01:54:36,180
to see some of those because some of 
them are fuckIng hilarious.

2719
01:54:36,210 --> 01:54:41,210
He's got jujitsu students who pretend 
that they're angry brazilians who come 

2720
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:45,231
to fight eddie and they come to 
challenge them like they're karate 

2721
01:54:45,231 --> 01:54:45,231
masters or you know,
they're different.

2722
01:54:45,231 --> 01:54:45,231
Different

2723
01:54:45,231 --> 01:54:46,440
thanks.
Sometimes he's not a burden.

2724
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:50,570
That was never a brazilian.
It was always just the expert.

2725
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:52,230
Now he's adding a brazilian accent.
Okay,

2726
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:57,270
now he is,
but at times he's just a random karate 

2727
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:57,270
guy.
Orange.

2728
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:59,620
He's been like days of our lives,
very talented,

2729
01:54:59,621 --> 01:55:04,621
hilarious actor slash comedian.
He was tech tech on days of our lives 

2730
01:55:04,870 --> 01:55:08,140
years ago and he's so fun.
He Trains with us at 10:30

2731
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:11,360
planet and they set it up all the time 
where he comes in and whenever there's a

2732
01:55:11,361 --> 01:55:13,250
new person there,
they did it with alan belcher.

2733
01:55:13,370 --> 01:55:16,670
They did it with the tim lee did it with
a bunch of different people.

2734
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:18,640
Whenever someone's there that doesn't 
know that

2735
01:55:18,810 --> 01:55:20,580
bag,
we got tom lawler with it.

2736
01:55:20,581 --> 01:55:22,470
Good.
We got tom lawler hook,

2737
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:22,950
hook,
line,

2738
01:55:22,951 --> 01:55:24,730
and sinker.
How about when you get seasick?

2739
01:55:24,770 --> 01:55:27,290
People's cecil piece of people's freak 
the fuck out.

2740
01:55:27,330 --> 01:55:32,330
now they get to the point where they do.
It's so ridiculous where eddie chokes 

2741
01:55:32,330 --> 01:55:32,400
these guys out and pretends to kill 
them,

2742
01:55:32,490 --> 01:55:34,860
and then a students dragged the guy off 
into the garage,

2743
01:55:34,890 --> 01:55:37,260
into the backyard,
to a total douche bag.

2744
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:39,960
Premises premises were signed.
Comes in.

2745
01:55:39,961 --> 01:55:44,961
We give each other a wink.
He starts doing karate kata on the 

2746
01:55:44,961 --> 01:55:46,820
disrupting the class and the crazy thing
is I'll get the camera.

2747
01:55:46,821 --> 01:55:49,890
Men usually they'll be pumped to.
I want to.

2748
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:51,870
Denny percopo is my one of my black 
belts.

2749
01:55:51,871 --> 01:55:53,440
I went up to him a few years ago and 
when,

2750
01:55:53,490 --> 01:55:58,490
when he walked in,
he never saw the response sketches 

2751
01:55:58,490 --> 01:55:58,610
before,
so I went up to denim denny,

2752
01:55:58,650 --> 01:55:59,850
you got your camera on you,
and he goes,

2753
01:55:59,851 --> 01:56:00,120
yeah,
yeah,

2754
01:56:00,121 --> 01:56:00,560
what's up bro?

2755
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,070
I go,
get it out.

2756
01:56:02,110 --> 01:56:04,580
Keep the kicker on this guy might have 
to fuck this dude up.

2757
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:05,310
He's like,
okay,

2758
01:56:05,311 --> 01:56:05,790
okay.
Okay.

2759
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:11,770
Video taping.
And I tried to sell it like we get into 

2760
01:56:11,770 --> 01:56:13,010
like an argument or a discussion for a 
couple minutes so you know,

2761
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:16,200
we don't want to get too crazy.
We slowly dragged people into it.

2762
01:56:16,350 --> 01:56:19,440
We start arguing and then we just start 
fighting and then I get crazy.

2763
01:56:19,530 --> 01:56:21,790
I tried to kill them.
I'm a total douche bag.

2764
01:56:21,791 --> 01:56:26,740
I actually tried to kill the twitches 
and shakes and shaded kicks his legs and

2765
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:31,760
then people drag them off into the back.
we just did it at the ufc expo in front 

2766
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:32,150
of a lot of people.
Got it on.

2767
01:56:33,650 --> 01:56:37,110
We got tom lawler and vinnie my.
That is fucking hilarious.

2768
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:40,620
What's so hilarious about it is it's 
completely unexpected.

2769
01:56:40,621 --> 01:56:45,621
How many people would think that a 
jujitsu master would also be doing 

2770
01:56:45,621 --> 01:56:46,620
pranks like on a regular basis?

2771
01:56:48,330 --> 01:56:51,210
Most of those pranks or on my dvd,
mastering the rubber guard,

2772
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:52,950
a bunch of them.
And the original one,

2773
01:56:52,951 --> 01:56:57,951
the original bag that I got on video is 
in 2010 years ago as quad tooth when I,

2774
01:56:59,070 --> 01:56:59,660
when I,
uh,

2775
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:01,770
put some black makeup on and another 
time I was a black guy,

2776
01:57:01,771 --> 01:57:06,771
I was scaring my friends.
That's my mastering the rubber guard 

2777
01:57:06,771 --> 01:57:06,771
dvd.
that was the original one.

2778
01:57:06,771 --> 01:57:09,030
That was before punk.
And that's,

2779
01:57:09,210 --> 01:57:11,710
I've alWays had that in me for some 
reason.

2780
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:16,820
You have a very strange sense of humor.
It's like my default setting is 

2781
01:57:16,820 --> 01:57:20,330
constantly saying like inappropriate 
things and the wrong things and I don't 

2782
01:57:20,330 --> 01:57:24,861
know what it is.
You have been like that since I met you 

2783
01:57:24,861 --> 01:57:24,861
and that's why I tried to talk to you to
do stand up.

2784
01:57:24,861 --> 01:57:26,420
And he did it for nine times.
Yeah.

2785
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:29,530
Damn.
Standup is way harder than jujitsu.

2786
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:33,600
That's for damn sure not to spend a lot 
of time perfecting.

2787
01:57:33,601 --> 01:57:38,601
Stand up.
You can't just go up there and tell 

2788
01:57:38,601 --> 01:57:38,601
jokes.
Jujitsu wasn't in the beginning.

2789
01:57:38,601 --> 01:57:42,890
It's no different.
I think it's just like anything else to 

2790
01:57:42,890 --> 01:57:44,550
get great at anything just requires time
and effort and thought and concentration

2791
01:57:44,551 --> 01:57:46,350
and evolving.
That's all it is.

2792
01:57:46,530 --> 01:57:47,550
And comedy,
you know,

2793
01:57:47,551 --> 01:57:49,260
you got to bomb.
You started off terrible.

2794
01:57:49,261 --> 01:57:51,810
If you saw me when I first started off,
if I had some video,

2795
01:57:51,811 --> 01:57:54,510
I got some somewhere,
some vhs tape of me on stage,

2796
01:57:54,530 --> 01:57:59,530
like,
like the 10th time I was ever on stage 

2797
01:57:59,530 --> 01:57:59,530
or something like that.
Dude,

2798
01:57:59,530 --> 01:57:59,970
I was fucking terrible.
you know,

2799
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,920
one's good in the beginning.
It's like everything else.

2800
01:58:01,921 --> 01:58:03,300
I mean,
you got good at jujitsu.

2801
01:58:03,301 --> 01:58:08,301
You aren't good at jujitsu when you 
first started and thinking about you 

2802
01:58:08,301 --> 01:58:08,301
now,
you know,

2803
01:58:08,301 --> 01:58:08,301
that's a,
I think about,

2804
01:58:08,301 --> 01:58:13,281
you know,
since when I tried stand up for the 

2805
01:58:13,281 --> 01:58:13,281
first time,
I had never.

2806
01:58:13,281 --> 01:58:16,180
It was before I had a school.
We were hanging out at the comedy store 

2807
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:16,500
every week and I'm seeing all these guys
go up and bomb and I thought,

2808
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:17,610
you know,
I could do this shit.

2809
01:58:17,970 --> 01:58:18,920
And um,
you know,

2810
01:58:18,930 --> 01:58:21,540
I went up and I realized that if I put a
lot of time into it,

2811
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:24,690
I might be able to be okay,
but I had to,

2812
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:29,780
I was spreading myself too thin.
I had to really think about what I was 

2813
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:29,780
at,
what was I going to be a comedian,

2814
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:33,360
a jujitsu flair and end of musician.
I had to figure it out.

2815
01:58:33,361 --> 01:58:38,361
So I just decided to not pursue common 
anymore and just focus on jujitsu and 

2816
01:58:38,361 --> 01:58:40,470
focus on my music.
And who knows,

2817
01:58:40,471 --> 01:58:42,010
maybe one from,
from

2818
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:47,040
teaching the last seven years I think 
I've gotten a lot more comfortable 

2819
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:47,950
speaking in front of people when before 
I was teaching,

2820
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:53,150
that was the hardest part of comedy is 
getting up and talking to a crowd that's

2821
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:55,600
stopping you crack jokes when you were 
on stage at the viper room.

2822
01:58:58,090 --> 01:58:59,050
Yeah.
BuT you know what,

2823
01:58:59,051 --> 01:59:01,300
when people are aren't paying for 
laughs,

2824
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:06,420
it's easier to make them run pan to it.
It seems like it's a little different 

2825
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:08,410
finding.
So it's easy.

2826
01:59:08,411 --> 01:59:10,420
I could well coming from someone who's 
done it.

2827
01:59:10,421 --> 01:59:12,580
and this is why I told you in the 
beginning that you could do it.

2828
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:15,040
It's just a matter of effort and 
concentration.

2829
01:59:15,041 --> 01:59:18,040
You have a comedian sense of my sense of
humor.

2830
01:59:19,210 --> 01:59:21,820
Now days with youtube,
eddie could make a video that's probably

2831
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:26,821
a million times funnier than him having 
to go on stage for three years just to 

2832
01:59:26,821 --> 01:59:26,920
get a joke out,
you know?

2833
01:59:27,190 --> 01:59:28,540
Right.
But it won't be standup comedy,

2834
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:29,970
you know,
the differences,

2835
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:30,910
you know,
standup comedy,

2836
01:59:30,911 --> 01:59:33,260
you can actually have a bunch of people 
come to see you in a place.

2837
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:34,650
You can make a living off it.
Yeah.

2838
01:59:34,770 --> 01:59:39,770
But he can make a living off of these 
videos if you wanted to do the same 

2839
01:59:39,770 --> 01:59:39,770
shit.
You know what I mean?

2840
01:59:39,770 --> 01:59:40,260
Like today,
how do you make a living off youtube?

2841
01:59:40,690 --> 01:59:45,690
really weird.
Are you making a living off youtube 

2842
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:45,690
videos?
I could if I wanted to.

2843
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:45,690
Probably.
Really?

2844
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:46,840
How much do you make off to people make 
off youtube videos.

2845
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:49,420
There's people have whole careers based 
on youtube videos.

2846
01:59:49,421 --> 01:59:51,070
Look at taylor.
Look how much.

2847
01:59:51,210 --> 01:59:56,210
Okay,
but how much money can you make off of 

2848
01:59:56,210 --> 01:59:56,210
youtube video you're saying from 
advertising?

2849
01:59:56,210 --> 02:00:00,220
Are you saying from people coming to see
you and I'm saying now I'm saying back 

2850
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:03,721
in the day used to be you had to get on 
stage to not become a standup comic and 

2851
02:00:03,721 --> 02:00:08,590
really work to get like 30 people in a 
room where nowadays you can take these 

2852
02:00:08,590 --> 02:00:10,180
same bits and jokes,
make it into a youtube video,

2853
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:15,750
get a billion people and if you keep on 
doing that then you could have a whole 

2854
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:18,190
career based off either advertising or 
you could have like a show on crackle.

2855
02:00:18,310 --> 02:00:22,570
I mean there's a lot of websites like 
crackle that have sitcoms are tv shows,

2856
02:00:22,571 --> 02:00:26,830
web based series that are all based off 
people that did it and I understand what

2857
02:00:26,831 --> 02:00:27,790
You're saying.
however,

2858
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:32,820
what you're saying diminishes the idea 
of the artist standup comedy and that's 

2859
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:35,611
why it's silly.
I'm telling him thAt he could be an 

2860
02:00:35,611 --> 02:00:35,611
artist,
a standup comedian.

2861
02:00:35,611 --> 02:00:37,180
He can go places and perform and do 
stand up comedy.

2862
02:00:37,181 --> 02:00:39,940
What you're saying is he can instead do 
videos.

2863
02:00:40,110 --> 02:00:45,110
I think a lot.
I think a lot of standup people that 

2864
02:00:45,110 --> 02:00:47,551
want to be standup comics are now 
changing how they're getting their 

2865
02:00:47,551 --> 02:00:47,800
audience.
You know,

2866
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:49,780
I Think I definitely think can be people
want to be.

2867
02:00:49,781 --> 02:00:51,250
Comedians were getting a lot of 
audience.

2868
02:00:51,251 --> 02:00:52,640
I mean that bob burnham kid,
he,

2869
02:00:52,641 --> 02:00:57,641
he got a huge following from his youtube
videos and you could definitely get 

2870
02:00:57,641 --> 02:01:02,161
people attracted to stuff that you put 
online and they want to come see you 

2871
02:01:02,161 --> 02:01:02,161
live.

2872
02:01:02,161 --> 02:01:03,710
But what I was saying to eddie was that 
he could be an artist,

2873
02:01:03,711 --> 02:01:05,980
so stand up comedian as an artist.
He could do it.

2874
02:01:05,981 --> 02:01:09,060
He has a sense of you're welcome.
He has that sense of humor.

2875
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:14,100
He's got that way of looking at things.
He's always looking at the most 

2876
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:14,620
ridiculous side of things when whenever 
there's a subject that comes up with the

2877
02:01:14,621 --> 02:01:19,621
news,
he's always looking at the most 

2878
02:01:19,621 --> 02:01:19,621
ridiculous aspect of it.
LIke automatically.

2879
02:01:19,621 --> 02:01:24,560
And that's,
that's a comedian sensibility things 

2880
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:24,960
that funny guy looking for an audience.
So yeah,

2881
02:01:25,410 --> 02:01:26,860
he is.
But that's what I'm saying.

2882
02:01:26,861 --> 02:01:31,861
like stamp comics seems kind of diluted 
nowadays because I think if you're a 

2883
02:01:31,861 --> 02:01:34,831
funny guy looking for an audience back 
in the day stamp comedies that like one 

2884
02:01:34,831 --> 02:01:35,590
of the only few options you could do 
because you couldn't get tv show.

2885
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:37,150
So now these people are like,
hey,

2886
02:01:37,151 --> 02:01:39,100
I'm a funny guy.
I want an audience.

2887
02:01:39,310 --> 02:01:40,070
You know?
I think a lot

2888
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:45,070
of these,
I think stamp comedies probably getting 

2889
02:01:45,070 --> 02:01:45,070
more and more diluted as more time goes 
on.

2890
02:01:45,070 --> 02:01:45,680
What don't you thInk?
No,

2891
02:01:45,690 --> 02:01:47,870
I disagree because I think the art of 
standup comedy,

2892
02:01:47,871 --> 02:01:50,720
to me as a patron,
as a person who goes to see it,

2893
02:01:50,721 --> 02:01:55,721
is still the most fun thing to see.
I went to see a louis c k the other day 

2894
02:01:55,721 --> 02:01:56,210
with ari.
I fucking loved it.

2895
02:01:56,211 --> 02:02:01,211
I had a great time.
I sat in the audience or the day when 

2896
02:02:01,211 --> 02:02:02,450
aziz ansari was working out of shit for 
the mtv music awards.

2897
02:02:02,540 --> 02:02:03,910
I was on that show,
don't you?

2898
02:02:03,911 --> 02:02:04,850
And I enjoyed it.
I,

2899
02:02:04,930 --> 02:02:07,490
I still enjoy the art of standup comedy 
in a,

2900
02:02:07,491 --> 02:02:10,610
in a crowd with a bunch of people there.
It's funnier,

2901
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:11,870
you know,
it's like the,

2902
02:02:11,890 --> 02:02:14,060
the comedy club atmosphere.
I like.

2903
02:02:14,110 --> 02:02:16,520
I like sitting in the crowd.
I like drinking.

2904
02:02:16,521 --> 02:02:18,560
I like how everybody's laughing 
together.

2905
02:02:18,830 --> 02:02:22,010
I think that art form to me is insanely 
satisfying.

2906
02:02:22,190 --> 02:02:24,810
Way more satisfying than watching a 
video clip on youtube.

2907
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:27,680
I haven't used the same thing.
I mean you said that there's a little.

2908
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:30,860
There's barely any real stamp comics 
nowadays,

2909
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:33,250
but have.
There used to be a bunch of real standup

2910
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:36,140
comics and nowadays there's.
That number seems to be a lot smaller.

2911
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:37,730
Well,
it's just because there's less places to

2912
02:02:37,731 --> 02:02:40,610
work.
In boston where I used to be mad,

2913
02:02:40,611 --> 02:02:42,680
there was so many different comedy clubs
in boston,

2914
02:02:42,681 --> 02:02:46,550
so many open mic nights that there was a
real community developed around it,

2915
02:02:46,551 --> 02:02:49,280
but then as the economy tightened up and
as you know,

2916
02:02:49,281 --> 02:02:54,281
a lot of these comics that were in that 
area moved out and the guys that had 

2917
02:02:54,281 --> 02:02:55,400
been there for a long time really didn't
write any new material.

2918
02:02:55,401 --> 02:03:00,401
Does the scene died out?
But if there was more comedy clubs and 

2919
02:03:00,401 --> 02:03:01,430
it was a thriving community,
they'd be more comedians.

2920
02:03:01,610 --> 02:03:03,920
The real Problem is they don't have 
enough places to perform.

2921
02:03:04,310 --> 02:03:06,410
There's not enough open mic nights and 
you know,

2922
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:07,790
comedy comes and goes,
man,

2923
02:03:07,791 --> 02:03:08,660
there's,
there's waves.

2924
02:03:08,661 --> 02:03:11,930
But I think right now is a very good way
for like established guys.

2925
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:15,150
Like if you look at all the guys that 
are around like louis c,

2926
02:03:15,151 --> 02:03:19,070
k,
and a chappelle,

2927
02:03:19,670 --> 02:03:22,130
chris rock,
dave attell,

2928
02:03:22,340 --> 02:03:26,510
nick depaulo,
jim norton a patent oswald,

2929
02:03:26,511 --> 02:03:28,220
of course,
he's one of my personal favorites.

2930
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:30,770
And you see all these different guys 
that are out right now.

2931
02:03:30,771 --> 02:03:32,540
If you're a fan bill burr,
of course,

2932
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:36,320
if you're a fan of standup comedy,
there's so much good comedy going on,

2933
02:03:36,321 --> 02:03:37,790
right?
francisco,

2934
02:03:37,791 --> 02:03:42,791
francisco,
I think this is one of the best times 

2935
02:03:42,791 --> 02:03:44,450
ever for standup comedy.
I think what's happened with the youtube

2936
02:03:44,451 --> 02:03:47,570
and the internet and my space on the 
ship is that people have had a chance to

2937
02:03:47,571 --> 02:03:49,200
extend their careers and,
and,

2938
02:03:49,201 --> 02:03:54,201
and make their careers like penetrate 
further in than they would have 

2939
02:03:54,201 --> 02:03:54,201
ordinarily.

2940
02:03:54,201 --> 02:03:57,140
Not having any television shows,
not having any movie credits.

2941
02:03:57,300 --> 02:04:02,300
You know,
now people are gettIng big audiences 

2942
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:03,390
just from stand up comedy just from 
using the,

2943
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:04,470
uh,
the youtube clips.

2944
02:04:04,490 --> 02:04:07,970
Why wouldn't you think that most standup
comics are in it just to become actors?

2945
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:09,520
No,
dude,

2946
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:10,640
no.
Really.

2947
02:04:10,641 --> 02:04:13,040
There's nothing more fun than real 
standup comedy.

2948
02:04:13,041 --> 02:04:16,760
I guarantee you jim norton is not in.
It's just become an actor,

2949
02:04:16,761 --> 02:04:20,030
a guarantee you louis ck is not in it 
just to become an actor.

2950
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:24,430
They're really good guys or not.
There's so much fun in doing standup,

2951
02:04:24,670 --> 02:04:29,670
but that's just like a couple people 
compared to the thousands and thousands 

2952
02:04:29,670 --> 02:04:32,921
of people that are in it for standup 
comedy to become what we're talking 

2953
02:04:32,921 --> 02:04:32,921
about the best guys,
but we're talking about.

2954
02:04:32,921 --> 02:04:37,410
I just think that a lot of people look 
at the idea of doing standup comedy as a

2955
02:04:37,411 --> 02:04:39,600
lot of pressure and that because of that
pressure,

2956
02:04:39,601 --> 02:04:43,110
they looked to get off that pressure and
that a television show is like a relief.

2957
02:04:43,110 --> 02:04:43,740
Like,
oh,

2958
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:46,260
I'm free of the pressure now.
If the show bombs,

2959
02:04:46,261 --> 02:04:49,800
it's not me.
That bombs is to show if the bad writing

2960
02:04:49,801 --> 02:04:52,070
was there when I got there.
There's nothing I can do about it.

2961
02:04:52,071 --> 02:04:53,580
If I do a movie and the movie doesn't do
well,

2962
02:04:53,581 --> 02:04:58,581
but the next month he does fine,
then I'm okay and so it becomes less 

2963
02:04:58,581 --> 02:05:00,840
responsibility on their back and a 
little bit easier and they look at it as

2964
02:05:00,841 --> 02:05:03,420
a steady income as opposed to like 
something stand up comedy.

2965
02:05:03,421 --> 02:05:04,310
It's like,
you know,

2966
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:06,890
no one's really going to be sure that 
people are gonna.

2967
02:05:06,910 --> 02:05:08,100
Come see you next week.
You know,

2968
02:05:08,101 --> 02:05:13,101
you could only assume that you're going 
to continue to have an audience and you 

2969
02:05:13,101 --> 02:05:13,940
have to continue to produce and continue
to do a,

2970
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:15,870
you know,
new sets on television,

2971
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:17,220
new comedy,
central specials.

2972
02:05:17,221 --> 02:05:22,221
Continue to write new material after 
that gets released so that people could 

2973
02:05:22,221 --> 02:05:22,470
come see you a year later and they know 
you got all new shit.

2974
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:25,200
So there's a lot of pressure and a lot 
of people don't like that.

2975
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:30,550
Maybe one day we'll do a,
we'll do a b.

2976
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:33,690
Brian will get up and we'll battle 
onstage.

2977
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:37,180
Battle battle battle.
Yeah.

2978
02:05:37,181 --> 02:05:38,710
Why can't you just go up?
How about this?

2979
02:05:39,010 --> 02:05:42,330
How about we do a 10th planet show and a
jovial host.

2980
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:45,520
Guys will go up.
Fair battle.

2981
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:47,200
No,
we don't have to.

2982
02:05:47,990 --> 02:05:48,650
No,
no,

2983
02:05:48,790 --> 02:05:50,810
no.
What I'm saying is do it

2984
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:51,850
planet.
Show joe.

2985
02:05:51,851 --> 02:05:55,170
He goes up and host brings aria.
Brings one of you guys up for,

2986
02:05:55,171 --> 02:05:56,160
you know,
five or 10 minutes.

2987
02:05:56,161 --> 02:05:58,020
Whatever you're comfortable with.
Brings.

2988
02:05:58,021 --> 02:05:58,920
uh,
the other guy up.

2989
02:05:59,010 --> 02:05:59,760
And then,
uh,

2990
02:05:59,850 --> 02:06:01,350
and then I'll go up.
We'll do it.

2991
02:06:01,351 --> 02:06:03,510
I'll do a show.
I could do five minutes.

2992
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:08,600
Yeah,
I think you're both could do five 

2993
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:08,600
minutes.
Brian fucking killed it in,

2994
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:12,581
in atlanta when he hadn't done comedy in
years and he got talked to the june it 

2995
02:06:12,581 --> 02:06:15,150
during the nighttime show filled with 
ufc fans.

2996
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:19,170
All fucking hammered on a friday night.
Sold out.

2997
02:06:19,230 --> 02:06:21,960
You were killed.
Not only did he do good,

2998
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:24,750
he went into the abyss and pulled 
himself out of the flames.

2999
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:30,250
He did good in the beginning and then he
did a couple of jokes in a row that 

3000
02:06:30,250 --> 02:06:33,711
tanked.
And you were starting to fucking freak 

3001
02:06:33,711 --> 02:06:33,711
out and he kept it together.

3002
02:06:33,711 --> 02:06:34,040
Yeah.
But you know,

3003
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:39,060
I started doing it a lot and I did a 
whole bunch and I started doing it 

3004
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:39,210
almost every week,
a few times a week,

3005
02:06:39,211 --> 02:06:42,360
but I got to a point where I'm just,
I just didn't have it in me.

3006
02:06:42,750 --> 02:06:45,390
You really have to give up your life to 
be a standup.

3007
02:06:45,450 --> 02:06:46,150
Well,
you know what,

3008
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:48,700
man,
you don't have to have it in you,

3009
02:06:48,701 --> 02:06:49,960
but just because you don't have it in 
you,

3010
02:06:49,961 --> 02:06:54,961
it doesn't mean that the art form is 
something that people should pursue if 

3011
02:06:54,961 --> 02:06:55,600
they want to be a comedian.
What you're saying though is that,

3012
02:06:55,840 --> 02:07:00,840
I mean as a comedian,
I mean I know you're not trying to 

3013
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:00,840
offend me,
but as a comedian it's kind of offensive

3014
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:05,131
because you're saying that like somehow 
or another that someone if they wanted 

3015
02:07:05,131 --> 02:07:09,181
to,
should just go and do youtube clips now 

3016
02:07:09,181 --> 02:07:09,400
and not become a standup comedian 
because it's too difficult.

3017
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:14,540
No,
I'm saying that if you are a uP comic 

3018
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:15,120
nowadays that it seems like youtube 
would make a lot more sense.

3019
02:07:15,150 --> 02:07:18,030
This boolean howard's target.
You know what I mean?

3020
02:07:18,450 --> 02:07:22,230
You know what I mean?
To be an artist as a standup comedian,

3021
02:07:22,231 --> 02:07:27,231
to be a real comic,
you have to do it in front of an 

3022
02:07:27,231 --> 02:07:29,061
audience.
It's the only art form where you must 

3023
02:07:29,061 --> 02:07:29,061
have an audience to practice.
If you do not have it all,

3024
02:07:29,061 --> 02:07:30,600
what's the difference between not going 
to be good?

3025
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:33,210
Because you don't have immediate 
response of people laughing at you.

3026
02:07:33,211 --> 02:07:34,260
Whether you know whether or not.
It's funny.

3027
02:07:34,261 --> 02:07:36,070
Why don't we ever made ever.
Now you

3028
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:37,840
don't though.
You're not hearing these people laugh.

3029
02:07:37,841 --> 02:07:42,841
I don't hear shit.
you just have people staring at you in 

3030
02:07:42,841 --> 02:07:42,841
texting things,
right?

3031
02:07:42,841 --> 02:07:42,841
You know you don't get the same kind of 
direct,

3032
02:07:42,841 --> 02:07:47,761
immediate,
tangible response that you get when 

3033
02:07:47,761 --> 02:07:47,761
you're going on stage.
Well,

3034
02:07:47,761 --> 02:07:50,731
you know what?
Very asked various aspects of a joke or 

3035
02:07:50,731 --> 02:07:51,880
funny how the transitions work.
You hear yourself and the recordings you

3036
02:07:51,881 --> 02:07:54,130
need to know this part sounded falls or 
this part.

3037
02:07:54,131 --> 02:07:59,131
How too many words and it's an art form.
Just piecing it all together and 

3038
02:07:59,131 --> 02:08:00,100
performing it in front of a live crowd,
but when you nail it,

3039
02:08:00,101 --> 02:08:05,101
dude,
when you're on stage and you fucking 

3040
02:08:05,101 --> 02:08:06,050
nail a joke where the audience is dying 
and you're like,

3041
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:11,070
they're dying now,
and I got like five more levels to this 

3042
02:08:11,070 --> 02:08:11,070
joke,
this joke,

3043
02:08:11,070 --> 02:08:14,230
like I'm hitting them now and I'm like,
I got some shit coming up to that,

3044
02:08:14,231 --> 02:08:14,440
to this.

3045
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:17,350
I can't wait to get to because I know if
you think this is funny,

3046
02:08:17,351 --> 02:08:20,140
this next part is my favorite part,
and then boom,

3047
02:08:20,141 --> 02:08:20,710
boom,
boom,

3048
02:08:20,711 --> 02:08:25,711
and it piles on.
There's nothing like that that you're 

3049
02:08:25,711 --> 02:08:25,711
ever going to get off youtube.
There's this.

3050
02:08:25,711 --> 02:08:29,800
You're not going to get that feeling.
You're not going to get that sort of a 

3051
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:32,221
response from the people and as an 
audience member you're not going to get 

3052
02:08:32,221 --> 02:08:33,460
something that's that much fun.
There's nothing to me,

3053
02:08:33,461 --> 02:08:36,400
more fun still after doing comedy for 20
years,

3054
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:38,350
there's nothing more fun than watching 
comedy.

3055
02:08:38,530 --> 02:08:41,260
It's the best man.
It's so much fucking fun.

3056
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:42,520
It's the,
to me,

3057
02:08:42,521 --> 02:08:44,830
the most fun art form and that's why I'm
a comedian.

3058
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:47,110
What I was trying to say is that eddie 
could have done that too.

3059
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:52,560
The only difference between me and him 
is that he had other things to do is 

3060
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:53,710
focusing on and he he went and pursued 
those,

3061
02:08:53,711 --> 02:08:58,711
but if he didn't,
if he wasn't thinking about pursuing a 

3062
02:08:58,711 --> 02:09:01,231
career in jujitsu and wasn't thinking 
about pursuing a career in music and 

3063
02:09:01,231 --> 02:09:01,750
have the kind of time that I had when I 
started out doing comedy,

3064
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:06,840
for sure,
you would be just as successful as me 

3065
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:06,840
for sure.

3066
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:07,930
You'd be able to do everything that I'm 
doing come true come true.

3067
02:09:07,931 --> 02:09:09,400
You'd be able to do everything that I 
did.

3068
02:09:09,580 --> 02:09:10,930
Everything.
It's not hard.

3069
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:15,990
It's just a matter of focus and if 
you're an honest person and you evolve 

3070
02:09:15,990 --> 02:09:17,770
and you you your objective and you look 
at your shit and you keep working at it,

3071
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:22,920
that's all it is.
Maybe one day I'll call you have the 

3072
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:22,920
sense if you don't have the sense of 
humor,

3073
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:24,670
okay.
if you don't have the mind for comedy,

3074
02:09:24,671 --> 02:09:26,020
that type of person who looks at things 
goes,

3075
02:09:26,410 --> 02:09:27,610
everybody else is agreeing,
and you go,

3076
02:09:27,611 --> 02:09:29,540
wait a minute,
what the fuck is that like?

3077
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:31,600
That's how I was my whole life and 
that's how you are,

3078
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:33,580
and brian,
you are to a certain extent too.

3079
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:38,700
I mean you have a different sense of 
humor than I do and brian and eddie has 

3080
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:38,920
a different sense of humor that you and 
we're all different,

3081
02:09:39,070 --> 02:09:41,950
but we all have the same thing where 
brian like you,

3082
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:44,800
your sense when it comes to technology,
you're always doing this.

3083
02:09:44,890 --> 02:09:46,900
Someone to bring up a point and you'll.
You'll always be like,

3084
02:09:47,630 --> 02:09:52,630
no,
everybody just thinks that because this 

3085
02:09:52,630 --> 02:09:52,630
bubba,
bubba,

3086
02:09:52,630 --> 02:09:55,411
bubba,
you'll go against the grain right away 

3087
02:09:55,411 --> 02:09:55,411
and pick out the flaws.
That's the idea.

3088
02:09:55,411 --> 02:09:59,250
That's the mind of a standup comic.
The person who stands up as the person 

3089
02:09:59,250 --> 02:10:01,360
who's functioning societies to stand up 
and look at things besides being funny.

3090
02:10:01,420 --> 02:10:03,370
Stand up and look at things and goes,
what the fuck is this?

3091
02:10:03,640 --> 02:10:05,530
That's what the comic does.
The comic looks at something.

3092
02:10:05,531 --> 02:10:07,060
He goes,
what the fuck is this?

3093
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:08,530
When everybody else just takes it for 
granted,

3094
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:11,440
there's a lot of comics out there.
They just never become comics.

3095
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:16,680
That's what I'm trying to say.
There's guys that work in gas stations 

3096
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:19,920
that could be one of the funniest guys 
that have ever walked the face of the 

3097
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:22,621
earth.
Just no one ever talked them into 

3098
02:10:22,621 --> 02:10:22,621
getting onstage.

3099
02:10:22,621 --> 02:10:22,621
They never directed their life in that 
order.

3100
02:10:22,621 --> 02:10:23,680
They never had the discipline to follow 
through.

3101
02:10:23,890 --> 02:10:28,890
You know,
there's so many people like that that I 

3102
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:28,890
met out there.
My friend johnny b,

3103
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:28,890
my friend who was a pool player that 
died.

3104
02:10:29,110 --> 02:10:34,110
That guy could have been one of the 
funnIest fucking comedians that ever 

3105
02:10:34,110 --> 02:10:34,340
lived.
That dude could read.

3106
02:10:34,341 --> 02:10:37,060
Human nature knew when people were full 
of shit,

3107
02:10:37,090 --> 02:10:42,090
knew,
knew what people's insecurities and 

3108
02:10:42,090 --> 02:10:42,090
weaknesses were,
and always knew the funniest shit to say

3109
02:10:42,090 --> 02:10:46,661
at any given moment.
There's a lot of people like that out 

3110
02:10:46,661 --> 02:10:46,661
there and that's what a stand up comic 
as you both are.

3111
02:10:46,661 --> 02:10:48,230
You both could do it.
Thank you very much.

3112
02:10:48,710 --> 02:10:51,170
Thank you.
This fucking shows over bitches.

3113
02:10:51,350 --> 02:10:53,720
It's five.
Oh yes.

3114
02:10:53,721 --> 02:10:55,940
thank you for sponsoring us.
Fleshlight.

3115
02:10:56,180 --> 02:11:01,180
Please don't.
Don't be a pussy if you are a pussy and 

3116
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:01,180
you know,
and you want to lIve your life,

3117
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:05,771
just pretending you don't masturbate or 
pretending that it's something shameful 

3118
02:11:05,771 --> 02:11:07,580
about getting pleasure on your deck,
then don't order the fleshlight,

3119
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:10,940
but everybody else go order one of those
things and fuck the shit out of it.

3120
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:13,850
It's awesome.
