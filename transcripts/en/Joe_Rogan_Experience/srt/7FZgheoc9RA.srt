1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,760
The joe rogan experience of Vi red.

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:03,594
Why the worlds?

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,580
The opening line is something like,

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,220
I can't remember the opening
line and I'm paraphrasing.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,720
The earth was B.

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,610
We knew we were being watched or what
we didn't know was we were being watched

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,420
and that's a great opening
line for a Scifi novel.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,390
Martians are watching us and then they
shunned their ships and everything.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,700
It's a beautiful Scifi novel
because it's so precise.

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:25,891
Just Know Sigh.

11
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:29,280
He made up all the PSI and wells really
did make it up like he knew nothing

12
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:30,890
about technology show.

13
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:31,724
It's awesome.

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,190
You know how the tripods come out of
the ships and they have laser beams and

15
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:39,390
they basically laser beam everything.

16
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:40,500
Like he just started made APP.

17
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:43,080
It's going to be this beam
of pure energy or whatever.

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,120
You know what's fascinating
and he did do that,

19
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:48,570
but that's what a lot of people use
as their template for the future.

20
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,490
When they thought about
like future weapons,

21
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,720
it was always a laser beam.

22
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,100
It was always a beam.

23
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,880
Well wait,

24
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,480
I think what's,

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,900
once physics were understood that
things were in particles that wasn't,

26
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:58,591
that they get jumped,

27
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,424
that there would bitch be,

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,353
first of all,

29
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,021
this isn't Zeus.

30
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:02,370
Is Thunderbolts the ultimate.

31
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,001
Yes.

32
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:03,510
You know?

33
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,343
Sure,

34
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:04,970
dude.

35
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,803
Um,

36
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,121
yeah,

37
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:06,391
just,

38
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:06,571
I mean,

39
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:07,860
just thunder in general.

40
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,240
Just the idea of this power,

41
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,900
this electricity for everybody knew what
electricity wasn't what it could do.

42
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,880
I would have loved to been alive,

43
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,420
um,

44
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,170
before electricity was explained and
see what the fuck people were saying.

45
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:19,861
You know,

46
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:20,610
I mean,

47
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,070
could you imagine what
people were saying back when,

48
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,933
you know,

49
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,600
people barely had a language they barely
could string together a sentence that

50
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:31,770
you would understand and the fucking sky
bolts of come to a sky and hitting the

51
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:33,180
ground balls of light.

52
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,351
Yeah,

53
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:33,990
that's true.

54
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,210
Through a field you
have to deal with that.

55
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,020
You know,

56
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,670
there's been an instance
that I read about,

57
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:38,910
um,

58
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,320
well of ball lightning.

59
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:43,830
Like there's been several instances of
ball lightning that they think explains

60
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,683
Ufos.

61
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,120
Yeah.

62
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,871
I wouldn't be surprised.

63
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:47,700
I think that that a lot of,

64
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,440
not all you have,

65
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,273
I was obviously,

66
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,670
but some Ufo sightings,

67
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:54,750
they talk about these orbs that are
flying orbs of light apparently under

68
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:57,270
certain geological pressures,

69
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,830
like certain pressures
on near fault lines and,

70
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,973
and the like,

71
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,590
there's,

72
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,010
there's fucking bolts of lightening
that like come out of the ground.

73
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,050
I wouldn't be surprised if,

74
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,451
yeah,

75
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:09,480
it's supposed to and it can last
for like three or four seconds.

76
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:09,811
We'll,

77
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:13,590
if everything in the world is an electric
charge and everything is totally makes

78
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:13,831
sense.

79
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:14,160
Right.

80
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,450
Just a weird spark,

81
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:15,831
you know,

82
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:16,860
that occurs.

83
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,190
What is this ball of light and yeah,

84
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,180
mainly exciting.

85
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,960
My wife and I were in a Capri ones and uh,

86
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,930
it's a little island
off the coast of Naples.

87
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:29,990
And is that enough?

88
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,993
Uh,

89
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,270
well I think they're saying
this is ball lightning.

90
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:33,920
Yeah.

91
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,120
Yeah.

92
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,750
That could believe it would be ball
lightning cause ball lightning has weird

93
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:37,440
properties.

94
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,711
Yeah.

95
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:37,921
Look,

96
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:39,120
look at that just disappeared.

97
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,140
It's a femoral and it righter than fuck.

98
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:43,500
So you can see it from miles away.

99
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:44,300
Right and right.

100
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,350
And you when lightening hits things,

101
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:47,970
you know how you always
see sparks and shit?

102
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:48,960
Well,

103
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,100
my wife and I were sitting,

104
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,810
we were having dinner and this and it's
a little island and a big storm started

105
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:57,240
brewing on the Mediterranean
and all of a sudden everything,

106
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:57,511
you know,

107
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,860
the ozone in the air and
your hair starts to stand up.

108
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:03,360
And it was a light breeze and Capri
smells like Lemons and bay leaves.

109
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,390
So it was really beautiful.

110
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,471
And I said to my wife,

111
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,440
and this is what a rabbit smells like
right before the lid comes down on the,

112
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,883
um,

113
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,550
Bailey in Lebanon and hey,

114
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,030
I'm a,

115
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,300
I'm uh,

116
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,280
and then we sat on the balcony of our
hotel and the storm never hit Capri,

117
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,910
but it was several miles away
and we watched it and it just,

118
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,330
just giant lightening strikes out in
the clouds and that it never got close

119
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:28,991
enough to rain.

120
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:29,710
You know what I mean?

121
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:29,831
Oh,

122
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:30,281
that's great.

123
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:30,641
And it was,

124
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:30,771
yeah,

125
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:31,121
I said,

126
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:32,710
this is like watching the gods play,

127
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:32,981
right?

128
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:33,640
Like here,

129
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,320
we're sitting here with a glass of
wine and the air electric and all you,

130
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,550
you'd hear it,

131
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:40,600
you know,

132
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,261
and then you,

133
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:41,531
you know,

134
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,710
you see it and then you'd hear it
afterwards because it was that far away.

135
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,720
Now you need clouds to have light.

136
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,080
Yeah.

137
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,820
And the clouds were just
crashing together and it would,

138
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,400
you'd see like,

139
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,260
Shit,

140
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,011
what I'm saying is,

141
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:51,581
were you were,

142
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:52,720
you didn't have to worry.

143
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,220
There's no clouds above you.

144
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:55,054
You didn't have to worry.

145
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,810
We were,

146
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,670
it was at least a couple of miles away.

147
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,481
Wow.

148
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:00,100
So you don't want to clear sky said it.

149
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:00,934
Yeah.

150
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,980
Uh,

151
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,230
yeah.

152
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,370
Clear Mediterranean sky simply that you
could feel the raised electricity in the

153
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:11,371
air because there was a breeze blowing
end on your hair was on an down and there

154
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:12,971
was a lot of ozone,

155
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:13,804
you know,

156
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,740
from all the crashing,

157
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:17,800
but it never got close enough to never
hit the island and never poured rain.

158
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,330
It just sort of stayed
right off the island.

159
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:20,050
And I was like,

160
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,890
that's so exciting.

161
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:23,230
If I could always have storms to spectate,

162
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:23,950
you know,

163
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,820
cause she'd watch a ball just like shoot
from one cloud to another arcane rope,

164
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:28,121
you know,

165
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:28,810
and,

166
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,610
and it was endlessly entertaining.

167
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,310
There's nothing more
entertaining than lightening,

168
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,144
you know,

169
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,490
the noise of the thunder
and that smell of,

170
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
especially if you know
you're not going to die.

171
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,150
That was what made it so great.

172
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:42,010
We were sitting there with
a joint and a glass of wine.

173
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:42,611
It was like,

174
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:43,420
you know,

175
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,280
heavenly cause if you're in a city,

176
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:46,420
like if you're in New York City,

177
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,090
big no storm goes on.

178
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,050
You have this weird feeling that
lightening could hit this fucking building

179
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,930
anytime and my windows could explode.

180
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,680
I was on a plane with my
wife going into Frankfurt,

181
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:04,681
Germany for the World Cup like in 2006
and we flew through a giant electrical

182
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,154
storm.

183
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,960
So we're on the plane and I'm looking out
the window and the plane's bouncing up

184
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:14,380
and down and a giant ball of lightening
struck the wing of the plane.

185
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,910
Oh my watch on.

186
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:20,911
And it went like this and then
bang and huge booming noise.

187
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,900
The lights dimmed for a second and went
right back on and everyone on the planet

188
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,651
like dot.

189
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:27,170
Right.

190
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,950
Oh Margo flight attendants
went fucking white.

191
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:32,410
Which then I was a little
scared because I thought,

192
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:33,700
well they shouldn't be freaked out.

193
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,300
Right.

194
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,640
And my wife was panicked.

195
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,750
He and I went,

196
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,310
not that I was so great,

197
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,050
but I went the wing still there.

198
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,580
Let's start there.

199
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,870
The wing,

200
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,590
the wing is completely intact and hit
the ball lightning right at the end of

201
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:47,681
the,

202
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:47,891
you know,

203
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:49,340
the little metal thing they
have at the end of the one,

204
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,203
they have a metal thing,

205
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,483
uh,

206
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,950
exoskeleton thing around them.

207
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:54,950
So then lightening hits,

208
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,630
it's disperses around the planet.

209
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,190
So prepare for that.

210
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,220
Obviously you have to write because
they're going to fly through electricity

211
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:02,300
that look at that picture.

212
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,163
Oh my God.

213
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,320
You never hear about planes
blowing up because we got hit by,

214
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:06,981
look at this,

215
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:07,814
watch this.

216
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,340
Oh that will,

217
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:09,921
it's crazy.

218
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:11,510
Cause and then when you
see it in real life,

219
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,220
it looks like nothing like so fast.

220
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,800
Yeah.

221
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,900
Let me see what it actually is.

222
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,050
It got hit and then the pilot
didn't come off for like 10 minutes.

223
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:18,650
That rat,

224
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,490
he let us all sweat and everybody
was like scared shitless maybe.

225
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,500
Then the pilot came on and
he chocolate Kissinger.

226
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,910
He was German obviously,

227
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:26,200
but he,

228
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,661
he first,

229
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,710
he didn't German than English,

230
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:29,430
but when he spoke in English
she sounded like Kissinger,

231
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,623
the

232
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,700
blood is harmless and everybody was like,

233
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,563
oh my God,

234
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,440
what's going on here?

235
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,250
But it looks scary.

236
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,360
This is the Turkish airplane hit by
lightening strike inside playing video,

237
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,280
but I don't know why
there was sparks going.

238
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,031
Look at the door.

239
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:47,540
The doors.

240
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:47,990
Oh,

241
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,670
they just got hit right
there and the lights go out.

242
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,611
Oh my God.

243
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:54,630
It's terrifying.

244
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,623
The mountains.

245
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,040
Shit's terrifying man.

246
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,030
Shut it off now.

247
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:02,520
We're going to be nice.

248
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,340
Don't ever put that back on again.

249
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,750
We got to fly everywhere.

250
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,920
I'm flying this weekend.

251
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,520
Let's just collide together and drive.

252
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:10,881
Come on,

253
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:11,210
man.

254
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:11,890
Nah Man.

255
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,620
You know,

256
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,990
flying through the sky where
the fucking gods are angry,

257
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,481
I think.

258
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:18,300
Did I tell you this one?

259
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,891
If I've told it,

260
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:19,690
I'll stop.

261
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,301
We flied out.

262
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:22,910
Shalia Kaleah scout and
was on a little plane.

263
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,500
Usually you're on a giant plane,

264
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,780
but it was on like a seven 37 you know,

265
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,550
like that Australia.

266
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,330
Yeah,

267
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,880
it was a Virgin Australia,

268
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:32,840
which is agree with the airline.

269
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,260
So on the flight with
me and my wife has a,

270
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,220
the game,

271
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,780
you know the sky is a rapper,

272
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,020
right?

273
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,340
He's got a tattoo on his head,

274
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,010
whatnot and carry Hilden who's also
a rapper and a and their posse.

275
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:46,610
Right?

276
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,040
So it's hectic,

277
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:49,340
right?

278
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,420
It starts to get the MP and the pilot
comes on and goes like everybody strapped

279
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:53,840
in.

280
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,470
Okay.

281
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,303
For like ever.

282
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,460
And it Australia is 15 hours,

283
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,710
16 minutes long.

284
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,800
It's just the whole day.

285
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,400
And this lasted literally five hours,

286
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:04,720
right?

287
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,180
Wow.

288
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,100
Just bouncing up and down.

289
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:08,180
So I decided pitching yard,

290
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,620
the whole thing and on the,

291
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,670
on the sky map,

292
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,470
but it says like Paygo,

293
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,304
Paygo,

294
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,630
1500 kilometers,

295
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,420
meaning your 1500 kilometers from Paco.

296
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:17,960
Paco.

297
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,501
In other words,

298
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:20,060
the Pacific Ocean is so big,

299
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,580
there's no land masses,

300
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,150
nothing anywhere near you
where you're going over.

301
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:26,710
Right.

302
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,760
So you're not going to go
in because its turbulence,

303
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:30,410
it's not your fucking freaking me out.

304
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,244
You're not going to die.

305
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,330
This is an electric turbulence,

306
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,840
doesn't make planes crash and it doesn't,

307
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,730
unless there's some sort of Shitty,

308
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,530
a structural defect on
the plane like that,

309
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:39,711
you know,

310
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:41,150
the wings aren't glued on or whatever.

311
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,771
But I mean videos,

312
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,950
structural defect

313
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,360
generally.

314
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,570
Now you've been in a play turbulence data,

315
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:47,900
you know,

316
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,040
that's not what makes him crashing,

317
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,640
you know.

318
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,400
But anyways,

319
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,850
uh,

320
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,290
Shit Shit,

321
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,550
it's terrible in any case.

322
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,690
So we get through it and a next morning
and the rappers get up and they're all

323
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,080
like,

324
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,681
oh my God,

325
00:08:58,681 --> 00:08:59,850
I thought I was going to die.

326
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:00,661
And you know,

327
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:03,350
it was so bad last night
I was praying and La,

328
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:03,581
la,

329
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:03,701
la,

330
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:03,901
la,

331
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:07,050
they're all with really
shook up and carry.

332
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:07,771
Hilton is a,

333
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:09,690
a very lovely young rapper.

334
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:11,550
Lady wakes up,

335
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,890
it's been all night.

336
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:14,724
Mind you,

337
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,810
no one can move.

338
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:17,730
I stopped holding my wife's hand for five,

339
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,020
you know,

340
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,540
like,

341
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,680
like this for,

342
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,073
you know,

343
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,320
cause like this,

344
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,660
Oh what happened?

345
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,700
And the rappers because you didn't feel
that we were going to die that had to

346
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:27,941
claim it.

347
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:29,070
But I know that we are and she goes,

348
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,211
I took a pill,

349
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:31,044
I didn't see anything.

350
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,950
Ambien's a motherfucker get what?

351
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,840
And then she ate one piece of fruit and
put on a leopard miniskirt and came out

352
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,670
with her makeup and signed
autographs and I was like,

353
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,560
you're a star.

354
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,490
I want you on my team.

355
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,560
You are Alexander the Great,

356
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,320
everyone was scared.

357
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,990
The adrenaline you could
smell in the plane,

358
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,621
you know what I mean?

359
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:54,090
From five hours of bouncing,

360
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:54,361
you know,

361
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:54,900
just not,

362
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,733
oh,

363
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,210
you know you want it to stop,

364
00:09:57,211 --> 00:09:59,550
stop bouncing so we can stop producing.

365
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,140
And she just woke up a word.

366
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,491
Yeah.

367
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:07,200
Fucking put on a pushup bra getting
ready to for the photo call when they got

368
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:07,800
off the plane,

369
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,090
I believe you did tell the story.

370
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:12,150
I remember [inaudible]
herself will Ferrell was like,

371
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:13,560
you gotta be kidding me man.

372
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:13,861
Yeah.

373
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,990
It was either Ma this
podcast or another podcast.

374
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:16,860
I heard you tell a story.

375
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,290
I remember it now after it's over.

376
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,510
We talked about the girl
getting out and changing.

377
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:21,990
Yeah,

378
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,980
that's a great story.

379
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,220
Wow.

380
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,760
It's great that someone could be that,

381
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,550
that out cold on ambient.

382
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,120
So there's positive things to ambien.

383
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,580
I was talking about shit about Ambien,

384
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,770
but if ambient can get you to avoid that,

385
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,120
not one minute at that.

386
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:33,954
And it lasts.

387
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,650
I'm sorry,

388
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,820
I didn't mean to repeat it,

389
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:39,120
but it always made me laugh
because I was scared to death.

390
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:39,990
And when I got off the plane,

391
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:40,824
I looked like,

392
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,610
you know,

393
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,410
something James Brolin sat on,

394
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,570
I was squishy and moist.

395
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,520
What's your dance per day?

396
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,320
Yeah.

397
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,260
And you know,

398
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,330
you're just wracked.

399
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,803
Uh,

400
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,100
and all I wanted to do is like,

401
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:53,490
you know,

402
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,050
eat a club sandwich and die,

403
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,321
you know,

404
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:55,951
cause you're like,

405
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:56,490
God,

406
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,360
we're on the ground.

407
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,711
And she just like,

408
00:10:58,711 --> 00:10:59,544
Hey,

409
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,560
he's for pictures.
