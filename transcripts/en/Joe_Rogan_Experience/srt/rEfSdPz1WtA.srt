1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
Yeah.
And we're live,

2
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:03,480
ladies and gentlemen,
Lance Armstrong.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:04,770
How are you buddy?
Good man.

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,940
Thanks.
Thanks for doing this.

5
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:07,080
Appreciate it.
Thanks for having me.

6
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,200
I really appreciate it.
For your frill.

7
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,050
And,
um,

8
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,820
you know,
you were just telling me before this,

9
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:14,190
uh,
we were talking about social media and

10
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,120
social media.
The greatest part about social media as

11
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:21,390
he get in contact with everybody,
the worst part about social media is

12
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:25,410
that you get in contact with everybody.
And it was just this tiny percentage of

13
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:27,930
people that won't let it rest.
Like I was looking at something that you

14
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:31,710
posted and uh,
it was something about some,

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,790
like you had a great time doing some
race and like one of the first tweets,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,390
one of the first comments was,
uh,

17
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,540
yeah,
as good at times running away from drug

18
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,740
toasts are,
yeah,

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,193
that's right.
You're,

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,590
you're just going to have,
what did we,

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,630
I'm at posted the other day.

22
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,260
We were,
we were,

23
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,170
we were putting our Christmas tree up
and my family,

24
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,530
you know,
they all the kids there and Anna and the

25
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:57,750
lights and the,
and the ornaments and it's at the

26
00:00:57,751 --> 00:00:59,850
fucking Christmas tree.
And you know,

27
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,850
of course most people love it.
They think it's a cute picture.

28
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:04,450
But then there's always the one,
you know,

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,670
the tree is the tree juiced or,
or something.

30
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:09,570
I mean,
there's just always,

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,910
which I get,
I mean that's just part of it,

32
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,290
but sometimes you're like,
is that the best we got?

33
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,163
Like,
yeah.

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,870
I mean maybe that is,
maybe I deserved,

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,390
I dunno.
But it's like give it a rest sometimes.

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,190
Well,
you definitely deserve some of it,

37
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:23,880
right?
Yeah,

38
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,630
for sure.
There's no way around of course this,

39
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,030
but it's also,
I think one of the things about this

40
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:31,440
whole scandal,
the whole thing,

41
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,910
it illuminated the real issue and the
real issue is the entire,

42
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:36,990
and this is what we're talking about.

43
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,780
Bill Byrd did that thing on Conan or he
was saying,

44
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:42,210
look,
the fucking whole sport is like this.

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,470
It's not,
there was all the people that won the

46
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:48,900
Tour de France and all the years that
you did it.

47
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,850
If you go back to people that either
weren't implicated or didn't test

48
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,070
positive,
like what is it,

49
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:57,660
like 18th place or something fucking
crazy like that,

50
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,530
you know,
that that's probably generous.

51
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,670
I,
yeah,

52
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:03,870
right.
It would be,

53
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,140
um,
it would be hard to know,

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,620
hard to know that.
And um,

55
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,740
I mean they,
look,

56
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,170
Joe,
these are all easy for me to,

57
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,580
to sit here and say and talk about.
And people would say,

58
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:15,480
well,
of course he says that.

59
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,150
Right?
Of course he thinks that talks on the

60
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:20,460
table now you really don't have anything
to get it,

61
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,160
but is it,
it is.

62
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,630
No,
I mean it's,

63
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,260
um,
well I guess it is,

64
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,420
but you know,
people don't want to talk about that.

65
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,970
I mean,
people want to talk about my issue and

66
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,740
that's,
I guess also understandable.

67
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,810
Um,
but like it was a,

68
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:38,690
it was a fucked up time.
And,

69
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,460
and you had this,
you were at this crossroads of have a

70
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,650
very hard sport,
uh,

71
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:45,810
I very hard event.
Some would say one of the hardest

72
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,550
sporting events in the world,
three weeks,

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,650
2,500 miles,
conditions,

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,540
terrain,
et Cetera,

75
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:54,960
et cetera.
So that meets really the perfect drug.

76
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,010
When you have a drug that's,
that's incredibly beneficial and at the

77
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,960
totally undetectable,
um,

78
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,540
and,
and everybody dove in.

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,530
And so,
um,

80
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,200
nobody,
nobody,

81
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,320
nobody wanted to be in that position.
It's not like any of us growing up as

82
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,790
kids thought,
dude,

83
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,600
I'm going to,
I'm going to go to Europe and get all

84
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,960
doped up and tried to went packers.
No,

85
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:19,810
nobody wanted to be there.
Like,

86
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:22,000
we all went with pure intentions.

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,330
We got there and we're like,
and I'm talking about to this crop of

88
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:28,690
Americans that went to Europe and the
shit was messy.

89
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,370
And we're like,
whoa.

90
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,260
Like,
okay,

91
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,060
do we go home or do we stay in fight?
And,

92
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,800
uh,
literally,

93
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,950
uh,
almost everybody stayed and fought and

94
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:43,950
they fought.
We fought the way that,

95
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,140
that the fight was being fought.
And um,

96
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,301
you know,
and,

97
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:51,190
and that all meets with where we are
today.

98
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,550
And the people who were there,
I think can speak to it.

99
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,710
Me and my teammates,
my peers,

100
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,180
my rivals,
the competition.

101
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,330
Um,
and we have a unique perspective on it

102
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:02,890
because we were,
we were in the war,

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,190
but the person on main street,
right,

104
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,230
the corner of main and first wasn't
there and they don't understand it.

105
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,560
And so they can't really speak to it,
but that doesn't change the fact that

106
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,490
they're disappointed.
They're,

107
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,950
they're really disappointed.
That disappointed me,

108
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:20,320
that disappointing the sport.
Uh,

109
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,120
they might hate me,
they might hate the sport.

110
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,660
Um,
then they were most likely defenders of

111
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:28,660
mine.
And so they're pissed off.

112
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,030
And I,
you know,

113
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,290
it's taken me a long time to really
understand that.

114
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,920
Um,
but I'll spend the rest of my life

115
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:38,740
trying to,
trying to work that one out with that

116
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:39,521
person.
And I,

117
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:40,354
and I don't,
you know,

118
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,340
they're out there,
they're millions of them,

119
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,440
so,
um,

120
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,420
well they have a legitimate point.
But there's also,

121
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,660
there's people out there that want you
to be wrong and want you,

122
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,090
they want to find someone who's done
something bad and never let it go.

123
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,270
And I think there's,
there's definitely some of that going

124
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:01,880
on.
And there's also people that they don't

125
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,170
have a lot of sympathy for people who've
been extremely successful.

126
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,200
And I've made mistakes.
Like it gives them the green light to

127
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:11,990
just decide to just continually attack
you.

128
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,690
But if I,
when I tried to do,

129
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,540
when this whole thing was going down,
as I tried to put myself in your

130
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,990
position,
like you're this worldclass biker,

131
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:26,050
it's 1994 and that's right around when
you started using [inaudible] 95 95.

132
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,700
So around this time,
when you realize what those 20 years

133
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,540
ago,
20 years ago,

134
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,553
it's kind of crazy,
right?

135
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,870
When you realize that this,
that pretty much all the best guys,

136
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:43,820
we're doing this now.
What is that feeling like when you're

137
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:44,241
like,
okay,

138
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:47,150
I've got a crossover into this deceptive
territory.

139
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,880
Now all of a sudden I'm,
uh,

140
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,680
I have to lie about this.
I have to hide this and have to be a

141
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:56,681
part of this sort of underground thing,
this underground aspect that's a part of

142
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,070
great sport,

143
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,360
right?
Well,

144
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,810
W we,
we held off as long as you know,

145
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,470
I mean,
uh,

146
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,340
you know,
epl came along in the early nineties.

147
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,530
Um,
we SORTA got to Europe in [inaudible] 92

148
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,720
93.
Um,

149
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,370
and then it,
it by that point,

150
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:17,890
by nine fords,
you know,

151
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,540
full on and we're thinking,
okay,

152
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,450
this isn't good,
but surely they're going to have a test

153
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,980
for this free flow.
Um,

154
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,550
and we waited,
we waited and it just never came.

155
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,560
And then,
uh,

156
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,000
then we get to 95.
There's tremendous pressure on the team

157
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,150
within the team.
Uh,

158
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,190
we're losing the sponsor.
Will the sponsor renew?

159
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,130
The team wants results and we're going,
all right,

160
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,990
we're,
we're really fucked here.

161
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,710
And so we all collectively made the
decision in spring of [inaudible] 95

162
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:49,140
that,
all right,

163
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,870
we have to go play ball the first time
you shot that stuff.

164
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,020
What was that like?
That it's not,

165
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,821
it's,
it's,

166
00:06:57,821 --> 00:07:01,310
it's not like a,
I knew you were going to ask these

167
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:02,144
questions.

168
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,140
It's not like that.
It's not that type of drug.

169
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:05,750
It's not like,
no,

170
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,950
I don't mean like cocaine or,
or it's not,

171
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,150
it's not,
it's not,

172
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,060
I didn't mean it that way.
I met was there a feeling like,

173
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,741
God,
fuck,

174
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,470
we've crossed into this land of
cheating.

175
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,390
It was so long ago and that would have
been,

176
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:22,391
that was 21 years ago or 20 years ago.
It's a little tough to remember exactly.

177
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,640
Um,
um,

178
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,090
you know,
it also too,

179
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:28,610
I mean it wasn't as if there were other
things we did before that,

180
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:31,940
I mean their eco is,
is this hugely powerful drug.

181
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,860
But,
but there was,

182
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,040
you know,
we sort of,

183
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,340
uh,
call them gateway drugs.

184
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:37,751
I mean,
if,

185
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:38,584
if,
if,

186
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,950
if people is,
you know,

187
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,960
is,
is the myth of performance enhancing

188
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:45,794
drugs.
I mean there's,

189
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
there's marijuana too.
There's,

190
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:49,980
there's a lighter sort of entry level
stuff that,

191
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,210
what was the entry,
what was the first time cortisone?

192
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,640
Is,
is there another is to relieve pain or

193
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,490
just,
uh,

194
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,490
yeah,
I mean it is,

195
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:01,250
but it also works for,
for racing bikes.

196
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:04,190
But how does it work for racing bikes?
Um,

197
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,010
well,
it's such a strong anti-inflammatory

198
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,800
that you,
with that you just inevitably,

199
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:12,720
you feel better.
Whether it's physically you feel better,

200
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,310
a certain,
even just a euphoria that comes with

201
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:17,870
that.
That's,

202
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,280
you know,
and who knows what,

203
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,620
you know,
percent of it,

204
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,350
but at the same time you have,
you have a drug that,

205
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,490
um,
you know,

206
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:26,630
I love it when you,
when you know,

207
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,730
in cycling,
if you took cortisone,

208
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:29,600
you,
you would be,

209
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,870
it would be banned.
However you under your watch,

210
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,690
you know,
the NFL and then somebody gets,

211
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,550
gets banged up in the first half.
They go in at halftime,

212
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,370
they come out,
you know,

213
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:42,500
the announcer says they went in and they
got it.

214
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,000
They got a cortisone injection.
There'll be,

215
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,160
they're going to play the second half.
They rest for a hundred yards.

216
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,330
They win the game,
their hero.

217
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,310
It's like,
wait a second.

218
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,273
Yeah.
Like,

219
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,650
so it is what it is,
but it is weird.

220
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,180
It's weird what we've

221
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,250
talked about that a bunch of times.
Me and my friends,

222
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:04,251
like when you go to Gnc or you know,
like the UFC has this company,

223
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,330
uh,
muscle farm which sells a bunch of

224
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,400
supplements and things along those
lines,

225
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:12,210
but yet they ban performance enhancing
drugs.

226
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,160
Like,
well what are these supplements do?

227
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,290
Well,
they enhance you some way,

228
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,200
like a certain level.
Well we'll allow,

229
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,880
allow a certain level of improvement,
certain level of aid in recovery.

230
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,500
But anything past that as cheating,

231
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,140
well it's all performance.
A nap,

232
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:33,730
his performance in his short vitamins.
So we know that.

233
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,550
Right?
But,

234
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,300
but they're also a two has to be,
and I don't want to be critical of

235
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,130
whether it's the UFC is efforts to,
to combat doping or are you sought or

236
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,510
water or the anybody or any major sport.
You have to draw the line somewhere.

237
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,060
That's just,
and I get asked that all the time

238
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:51,640
because people,
people get frustrated with the issue and

239
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,200
it's,
they kind of throw their hands up and

240
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:53,560
said,
well look,

241
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,150
we should just,
it should just all be legal.

242
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,260
And,
you know,

243
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,470
they said that to me and they're,
they're thinking I'm going to go,

244
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:00,304
yeah,
you're right.

245
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,280
But you can't,
that's not the answer either.

246
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:07,240
There has to be a structure in place.
There has to be aligned.

247
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,310
And it might,
that line might seem weird or fuzzy to

248
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:10,600
people sometimes,
but shit,

249
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:12,970
you have to have something.
Um,

250
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,300
and so
dude,

251
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:16,991
it's tricky.
I mean,

252
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,880
anytime you mix,
uh,

253
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,940
athletes that are,
that are super motivated with,

254
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,920
um,
with money,

255
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,060
with a pressure that comes with that
temptation that comes with that.

256
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,720
You know,
people are for the rest of,

257
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,510
I mean,
come on.

258
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,080
I mean,
the original Olympic Games they were,

259
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,900
there were there was going on.
So it's,

260
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,160
you have to think that it's going to
happen forever.

261
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,650
It,
the substances will change over time.

262
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:43,300
But,
um,

263
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,920
it just,
unfortunately,

264
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:45,750
it's part of the game.

265
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,020
So the original writers like way back in
the early days of the Tour de France,

266
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,240
before they had drugs,
they were using alcohol.

267
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,150
You know,
there's all the,

268
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,090
there's a lot of stories about,
um,

269
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,320
whether it's alcohol,
cocaine,

270
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,510
um,
and crazy substances.

271
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:02,540
But,
but at the same time you had guys,

272
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,000
the Tour de France is a hundred years
old,

273
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,013
right?
So,

274
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,640
uh,
doping is cheating.

275
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:08,750
We know that.
But there's other ways.

276
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,950
I mean,
guys would hang on to cars,

277
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,880
guys would get in trains.
They were guys,

278
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,070
they would take a cork out of,
out of a wine bottle and they would put

279
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,150
this is this fucking crazy?
They would have fishing string in the

280
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:23,751
cork,
right?

281
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,820
So wired up and they would have it,
you know,

282
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,430
they have a car off the road and they'd
put it in the neuro cheat.

283
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,090
Oh my.
And you know,

284
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,970
just a subtle pole.
I mean,

285
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,080
did they,
you know,

286
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,670
any way to get ahead?
I mean,

287
00:11:34,671 --> 00:11:36,140
this is,
you know,

288
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:36,974
the,
the,

289
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,740
um,
the sport is just that it's a brutal

290
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,860
sport and you're not getting your face
pounded in like ufc,

291
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:46,010
but you certainly feel like you're
getting your face pounded.

292
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Well,
psychologically it's almost more

293
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,930
devastating cause it's so grinding when
you're talking about something that

294
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,950
three weeks and he goes,
is it 2100 2,500 miles?

295
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:58,210
Is that what it is?
2,500.

296
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,810
That's insane.
That's an insane amount of time pushing

297
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:02,360
your body

298
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,720
a hundred miles a day.
But once you get to the top level,

299
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,670
it's remarkable how efficient it is.
I mean,

300
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:11,360
you have 200 guys going down the road on
a normal day.

301
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:13,790
If it's a flat day and there's not wind
or crosswind,

302
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,340
um,
or rain or you know,

303
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,410
the conditions,
it's pretty easy to be honest.

304
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:19,670
I mean,
it's conversational.

305
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,000
The final is tough on the final gets
fast and people are competing for the

306
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:23,834
stage went.
But,

307
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,570
um,
it's not,

308
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,520
you know,
those three weeks aren't like three

309
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:30,000
weeks on the law.
I mean,

310
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:30,500
on,
you know,

311
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,840
in the red line.
So you have to pace yourself.

312
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,460
The peloton paces itself,
like the,

313
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:38,800
you know,
they sort of pace and police for,

314
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:42,410
for lack of a better word itself.
And when,

315
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:43,760
you know,
obviously the mountains and the time

316
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:47,480
trials or where the race is decided and
those are the hardest moments

317
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,250
when they first started introducing,
uh,

318
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,710
things like,
um,

319
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,540
uh,
when I started using the transfusions

320
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,360
and things along those lines,
how much of an improvement did it have

321
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,194
on the times?

322
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,900
Well,
you know,

323
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:02,471
it's,
it's,

324
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:05,890
it's hard to say because the Times that,
you know,

325
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,740
people look at our era,
they look at my generation and they say,

326
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:09,970
okay,
well the time supposed to be,

327
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,090
you know,
significantly faster and be immediately,

328
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,170
but you can't compare cycling to track
and field or cycling to another sport

329
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:21,670
that's had had a rough patch and is now
trying to clean itself up because

330
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:24,550
technology changes,
road surfaces change.

331
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,580
Obviously training has changed.
But um,

332
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,730
I mean if you go back to the 84 games
right here in Los Angeles,

333
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:34,260
that was really the first major exposure
you had for,

334
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,080
for transfusions,
um,

335
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,840
which,
which the American team did in rolling

336
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:40,770
stone exposed it.
Um,

337
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,490
but uh,
transfusion is just a,

338
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:46,510
it was an old school hipo replace that,
right?

339
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,460
Because you had a transfusion is just
adding red sales to your system,

340
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,490
which carries oxygen and,
and gives you more oxygen.

341
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,130
Then you had a drug came along that did
that for you.

342
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,760
So you didn't have to extract the blood.
You didn't have to put it back in.

343
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,603
It made it,
you know,

344
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,000
it made it a lot easier.
And then when the test,

345
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,150
when they refined the protest and
ultimately came up with it,

346
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
um,
uh,

347
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,270
then people went back to the old school
system.

348
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,580
So,
um,

349
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,330
and then came other ways to detect that
through not so much through a test,

350
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,060
but just through what they call the
biological passport.

351
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,000
So just studying parameters and your
blood,

352
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:28,710
whether it's ridiculous sites or red
cells or you know,

353
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,630
all of these things that the smart
people can come up with tests for.

354
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:34,630
That's,
it was more of a screening method to

355
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,660
detect,
uh,

356
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:41,020
a transfusion.
What's Kinda fucked up about all this is

357
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:41,854
that

358
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,870
you won the Tour de France seven times.
You obviously trained like a demon,

359
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:51,410
pushed yourself to the limits.
You beat everyone in the competition and

360
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:53,720
they were all doing the same thing you
were doing right.

361
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,400
Yet you're the one who was demonized and
yet you're the one who takes all the

362
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,030
grief.

363
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,920
Yup.
Yeah.

364
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,793
And

365
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,610
there's a situation that happens when
you're involved.

366
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,520
You're involving money,
you're involving sponsors,

367
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:09,570
you're involved.
When you,

368
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,230
once you first start,
once the ball starts rolling and the

369
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:17,760
first deception has been launched out
there into the ether.

370
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,620
Yup.
There's no way to take it back if you

371
00:15:19,621 --> 00:15:20,820
want to keep racing.
Yup.

372
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:21,640
Yep.

373
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,200
And that's the thing.
I mean people look,

374
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:28,140
I mean my situ,
my story and,

375
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:31,030
and I,
I hear you loud and clear and you can

376
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,470
say that.
I can never say that.

377
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:33,010
You know,
when I,

378
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,540
when I,
if I were to say things like that,

379
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,340
people would,
they would nuke me.

380
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,110
But it is what it is,
what it is.

381
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:40,430
But that's anyhow,
um,

382
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,700
there was the doping,
okay.

383
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,040
Which led to the lying.
Right.

384
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,260
Which led to the treatment of other
people.

385
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,190
I think by and large,
people can have the perspective that you

386
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:51,911
have.
They can say,

387
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:53,680
well,
looks to me like everybody did it.

388
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,240
So,
okay.

389
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,160
Uh,
then they can look to the line and they,

390
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,800
that's where they really start to not
like it.

391
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,110
I said,
this guy lied to us repeatedly,

392
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,400
but of course you get,
you know,

393
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:04,840
my,
there's no defense to that.

394
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,290
But if I could,
if I could share any personal insight.

395
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,041
I mean,
once you lie,

396
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:12,820
once you just keep lying to keep lines.
Not as if I'm going to sit here,

397
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,370
you know,
this is 15 years ago and Joe,

398
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:17,530
you're a nice guy and you,
I mean,

399
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:21,220
if I was on this podcast,
I would lied to your fucking face a

400
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:23,110
million times.
Just so you know,

401
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,010
I would've just shown you now,
just so you know.

402
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,830
But that's not a surprise to you or
anybody else,

403
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,080
but,
but once you're in there,

404
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,160
it's not as if I'm going to go,
you know,

405
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:34,990
this,
this guy joe seems like a really nice

406
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:35,950
guy.
I think I'm going to be real.

407
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:38,140
I'm gonna be honest with him.
Too much money.

408
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,030
There's no way you can't once that.
Yeah.

409
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:41,770
So I was,
I was stuck,

410
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:44,350
for lack of a better word in that,
uh,

411
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,540
in that,
does that lie or that deception?

412
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,410
But then the way that I took my
competitive nature,

413
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,630
which served me well in training and in
racing,

414
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,290
and took it into the real world,
took it into a press conference,

415
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,800
took it into a personal relationship,
took it into former teammates.

416
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,720
Uh,
my relationship with that,

417
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,160
what,
that's the part where people go,

418
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,230
okay,
fuck this guy forever.

419
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,460
Right?
I'm done.

420
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,410
And so,
um,

421
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,270
that,
you know,

422
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:13,030
you've got sort of the three phases.
None of them are good,

423
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,910
but as it got further away,
um,

424
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,530
that,
um,

425
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,010
you know,
lack of respect for others is the thing

426
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:23,410
that totally fucked me.
And you know,

427
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:25,080
too,
that I would,

428
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,880
I would say to anybody that I understand
and,

429
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,040
um,
I may be in their timeout forever.

430
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,350
Um,
I have,

431
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,420
uh,
and the only thing I will add that,

432
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,610
that,
that may sound like I'm trying to defend

433
00:17:36,611 --> 00:17:40,150
myself as I've,
I've tried to make amends with all those

434
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:41,080
people,
right?

435
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,330
The ones that we all know,
the ones people talk about,

436
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,160
I've traveled the world,
I've sat with them,

437
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:46,600
I've,
I've looked them in the eyes and said

438
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:49,620
what I did was totally unacceptable and
I'm sorry.

439
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,100
Um,
and almost everybody has accepted the

440
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:54,040
apology and,
and,

441
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,160
and we've moved on.
Um,

442
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,190
but that doesn't get to this,
this,

443
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,950
you know,
this crowd of people that,

444
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:04,890
that you can't sit with face to face and
you can't say you're sorry.

445
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,300
I mean,
I can talk to you,

446
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:09,330
we can talk about it.
Some people may view that as an apology

447
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:10,280
or are or not,
but,

448
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,500
but the ones that I could go sit with,
I did.

449
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,870
And that's all that I would add to that.
And I,

450
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:16,950
and I,
and I,

451
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,430
I mean,
I'm proud that most of those people,

452
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:21,630
and I say most,
not everybody,

453
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,420
because not everybody's ready,
but most of those people said,

454
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:25,254
you know what?

455
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,490
We're good.
We're done.

456
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,800
And so,
uh,

457
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,900
if it was my son and he acted that way,
first of all,

458
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,220
I'd say,
the fuck are you doing?

459
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,260
You can't act that way.
But I had no,

460
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:36,090
nobody was standing over me going,
dude,

461
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,670
what?
What are you,

462
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,110
you're acting like an asshole.
Nope.

463
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,130
Nobody did that.
So,

464
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,340
but if my son did that,
I would say you get over there and you

465
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:48,090
make it right with that person.
So that's where it is.

466
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:50,220
And uh,
here we go.

467
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,540
You're also in this bizarre position at
the time to be the only famous cycler

468
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:58,030
and the entire country cyclist cycler
isn't on it.

469
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,450
That's a cycler cycling drugs,
hiker,

470
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,360
biker,
but a bikers like sons of anarchy and

471
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:07,200
that's,
yeah.

472
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,540
Yeah.
I kind of got burned out on that series.

473
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,680
But
um,

474
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,730
yeah,
I mean the story weight to carry around.

475
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,720
Yeah.
And then there's the cancer

476
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:21,810
organizations live strong.
All of it has a lot of weight you're

477
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:24,210
carrying around.
I speak to it all the time.

478
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,310
I mean it was,
it was a huge wave,

479
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,640
but you're also balancing out so much
good with this lie and this lie is

480
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,570
helping.
All is good,

481
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,190
right?
Like the live strong foundation is

482
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:37,500
generating hundreds of millions of
dollars helping all these people with

483
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:39,890
cancer.
I've seen you in the hospitals with

484
00:19:39,891 --> 00:19:42,390
these kids and it makes it mean me
having kids myself,

485
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:45,930
it makes me cry seeing these kids with
face masks on because their immune

486
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:47,760
system,
so compromise and they don't have any

487
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:51,030
hair and they're just devastated.
And you're hanging out with these kids

488
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:53,730
and you,
you're generating all this positive

489
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:56,310
energy for them,
generating all this money,

490
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:59,280
all this,
all this research that's being funded.

491
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,200
So there's all this good as well.

492
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,580
You start telling the truth that
stopped.

493
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,770
We know what happens because it
happened.

494
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,660
Yeah.
It did happen.

495
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,130
It happened to,
and we dried up.

496
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,200
I don't see any of those fucking
bracelets anymore.

497
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,330
No,
Goddamn,

498
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,510
things were everywhere.
Yeah.

499
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,420
Yeah,
they were.

500
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,870
We had a good run and 85 million
bracelets.

501
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,820
Yeah.
But look,

502
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,100
I mean,
I don't want anybody to be mistaken.

503
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,740
I,
my interests were selfish.

504
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,670
I mean,
I was,

505
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,553
uh,
uh,

506
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,810
um,
defending myself and protecting myself.

507
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,790
Uh,
but at the same time,

508
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,390
it wasn't just myself.
I was protecting,

509
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:35,250
I was protecting the sport.
I was protecting our sponsors.

510
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:38,520
I was protecting the tour.
I was protecting the foundation.

511
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,200
Um,
and,

512
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,380
you know,
it's just hard to say I'm going to,

513
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,520
I'm going to stop and,
and,

514
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,930
and,
and what we just said.

515
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:48,850
I mean,
we now know on all of those things,

516
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,260
right?
We know what's happened to the

517
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:52,480
foundation.
We know what's happened to the sport,

518
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,460
we know what's happened to the sponsor.
We know,

519
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,360
and we can now see.
Um,

520
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,470
it was,
it was a devastating tall and,

521
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,910
um,
you know,

522
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,020
most would say,
well,

523
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:04,000
that's all your fault lance.
And,

524
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,450
uh,
and,

525
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,700
and maybe they're right,
but,

526
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:07,990
uh,
it's,

527
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,320
it's been,
you know,

528
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,800
did it,
especially on the foundations I did,

529
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:15,160
it just breaks my heart to see that,
um,

530
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,050
the effect it's had on their
effectiveness,

531
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,480
well,
it's got to be way more complicated

532
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,591
then.
It's just your,

533
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:24,570
all your fault.
It's,

534
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:26,860
it's,
it's way more complicated because when

535
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:29,560
you're talking about and tire sport,
that's dirty.

536
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,480
I mean,
for lack of a better word,

537
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,620
an entire sport that's being deceptive
entire sport that's using these

538
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:39,700
performance enhancing drugs.
And then you're talking about you

539
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,230
because you're this weird outlier here.
This one guy who is incredibly

540
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:47,200
successful at it in a country where
nobody gave a fuck about the Tour de

541
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:48,940
France until you came along.
I mean,

542
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,630
he's Greg Lamon you.
Yeah.

543
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,180
You know,
I mean there's,

544
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,310
yeah,
I mean,

545
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:55,580
that's it.
That's the only,

546
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,130
this is the,
I mean,

547
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,400
the story in the story being what it was
a cancer survivor that comes back that

548
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:06,510
when's this event the transcends the
sport that brings a sport to psych.

549
00:22:06,511 --> 00:22:10,650
And although greg to do,
I mean a tremendous job really,

550
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:14,070
that was like the first blow up of
cycling and the United States and then

551
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:16,020
comes my story.
I mean,

552
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:18,020
that's,
the story was soap.

553
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,740
The story was too big,
right?

554
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,500
I mean,
and that's the reason that,

555
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,220
that uh,
that incentivized and motivated people

556
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,270
like,
uh,

557
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,060
like Novitsky and like the feds to come
along and say,

558
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:30,960
oh,

559
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,300
a hundred percent,
hundred percent.

560
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:32,860
I mean,
they're not,

561
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,960
they're not doing that to save the
world.

562
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,630
They're not doing that to save the
children no matter what.

563
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,880
Ulterior motives that they might,
you know,

564
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,280
try to list as well.
We wanted to make sure the children

565
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:44,140
don't do this.
We wanted to send a great message.

566
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:45,350
We have bullshit.
It's,

567
00:22:45,351 --> 00:22:50,351
it's a high profile,
high publicity v Avenue for them to

568
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,090
achieve notoriety.

569
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:52,800
Yeah.
But,

570
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,461
but,
right.

571
00:22:53,461 --> 00:22:54,960
And we will get into that.
But the,

572
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,280
the,
you know,

573
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:57,570
my rival,
so if you take,

574
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,421
you know,
my main main,

575
00:22:58,421 --> 00:22:59,580
main rivals,
whether it's young,

576
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:04,320
old rick or Baso are bulkier been tawny
or their star factor,

577
00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:06,320
for lack of a better phrase,
was just,

578
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,770
was just different.
And they,

579
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,660
you know,
they weren't cancerous wasn't,

580
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,000
so it,
it,

581
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,690
there was this disparity which the sport
enabled there to be because it just kind

582
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:18,630
of an old school,
Janky sport in terms of the way it's

583
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,770
organized and run as a business.
Um,

584
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,080
that it,
it was like a,

585
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,060
you know,
like a South American economy.

586
00:23:27,061 --> 00:23:28,920
There was really the haves and the have
nots.

587
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,980
And uh,
that's a crazy way of putting it.

588
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:32,611
Yeah.
I mean,

589
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,080
when,
when you have something like that,

590
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,880
it doesn't work.
And so what you need to,

591
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,830
you know,
all of those ships need to rise with

592
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:41,231
that.
See.

593
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:41,930
And,
and,

594
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,520
um,
I probably didn't do a good enough job,

595
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,160
uh,
trying

596
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,840
to push for that in my,
in my time.

597
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,360
Um,
but don't you have only a certain amount

598
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,200
of resources?
I mean,

599
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:52,490
with,
one of the things that I've always said

600
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,860
about extreme winters is,
uh,

601
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,620
there's,
there's a borderline between greatness

602
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:00,110
and madness and he crosses back and
forth.

603
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah.
I would say the greatest and madness are

604
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:04,790
next door neighbors and they borrow each
other's sugar because there's almost no

605
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:09,500
way you can get that good without almost
losing your fucking mind.

606
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:10,730
Yeah.
Right.

607
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,940
I haven't met some people that are
fantastic at things,

608
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:15,590
the great ones.
I've met great ones,

609
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:18,920
especially great fighters,
and they're all fucking crazy.

610
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,450
Yeah.
It's almost like you can't,

611
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,530
you can't not be because every,
you can't be a regular guy and get

612
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:25,364
there.
Right.

613
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,070
I probably was.
I probably still am a little crazy.

614
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:28,963
Oh,
you're crazy.

615
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,200
I couldn't tell you.

616
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,460
Definitely crazy.
No,

617
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:33,380
but I don't,
I don't think you're bad.

618
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,180
I don't think you're a bad guy.
I mean,

619
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:36,630
I don't know you that well,
but I,

620
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:40,160
I just think you have to have that,
that sharpness.

621
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,400
Yeah.
You have to have that,

622
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,640
that grit.
You have to have that aggressive

623
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:47,120
competitive nature in order to succeed.
Especially in some fucking thing where

624
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,150
everyone's doing the same thing.
There's not a lot of creativity

625
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:53,300
involved.
There's not a lot of the variables.

626
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,420
You're fucking pushing yourself and the
machine yourself.

627
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,310
You're pumping your legs.
That's it.

628
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,181
You can't,
you know,

629
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:01,100
can't fake to the left and go to the
ride.

630
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,280
He can't fucking throw up some new moves
that no one's ever seen before.

631
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,290
You're,
you're,

632
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,250
you're fucking wishing yourself.
Yeah.

633
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:09,170
You definitely had some of those,
but at the end of the day,

634
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,290
you're on a fucking bike and everybody
else is on a bike and you're going up

635
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:15,170
the Goddamn same hill and there were no
secrets.

636
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,910
Right.
The Dat,

637
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,060
dat concentrates down what the
competitive nature is to like the edge.

638
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,950
Who's got the sharper edge?
Who's more intense and you John,

639
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,010
because of that and,
right.

640
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,480
He's getting riled up.
I get riled up,

641
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:30,210
dude.
It was,

642
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,090
I'm gonna step back.
Don't,

643
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,720
don't,
don't jump across this table.

644
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,220
I mean,
isn't that a big old Kettlebell over

645
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,090
here?
You should come over here.

646
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,550
Just settle down.
Isn't that what it is?

647
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,130
That it has to be what it is.
It's the only way to win.

648
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,080
It's,
it's an endurance event so you have to

649
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:48,030
be a little careful with that.
But there are those moments where you

650
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,680
just have to unleash everything you have
and you're going to unleash them in

651
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:54,320
training or an in racing and yet,
but yes,

652
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,260
that seems like a really good point
where you just put that up is there's,

653
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,760
you have to be careful with that.

654
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:03,470
You have to know when to put like how
you have to know your body like really

655
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:06,830
intimately as far as you didn't,
you have to manage it over the course of

656
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,800
many,
many women say the marathon,

657
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,710
I mean nobody takes off and you know,
like it's a hundred yard dash.

658
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:15,890
I mean you have to manage that.
Obviously you have the experience of

659
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:19,670
knowing what that effort is going to
look and feel like and you know how to

660
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:21,740
manage all of that.
But yeah,

661
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,750
I mean three weeks long,
man,

662
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:25,790
you've gotta be,
you gotta be careful.

663
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,750
Yeah.
Is there a moment where you remember

664
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:34,810
like during the race where you wanted to
push but you had to back down like there

665
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:37,120
was,
is there moments where you like you're

666
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:38,900
managing don't have it,
but yeah.

667
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:42,290
Where you feel like this is not a smart
thing to go.

668
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,023
Yeah.

669
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,420
And you know,
now you can,

670
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,583
I mean,
when we raised,

671
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,890
you know,
well in the old days people just drained

672
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:50,730
and they thought,
well,

673
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:52,470
I'm gonna go hard today and I'm going to
go easy tomorrow.

674
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,580
And then it came the heart rate monitor
and they followed their heart rate and

675
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,090
they met,
you know,

676
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,240
they manage their training or racing
through that and then came the power

677
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:01,980
meters.
And then so now there's all these,

678
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,740
you know,
there are these devices where you can

679
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:07,440
really monitor all of that stuff.
And so you're out there,

680
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:10,350
you're not just sort of driving around
blind.

681
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:12,930
I mean,
you actually can see what you're doing

682
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,180
and you,
and that makes managing that effort a

683
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:16,014
lot easier.

684
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,160
What is it,
what are the differences in the numbers?

685
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,080
Like if you go back to like a hundred
years ago,

686
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:22,150
well,
you assuming that people weren't using

687
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:27,180
corkscrews and or corks and fishing line
and whatever other ways she didn't.

688
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:28,390
Yeah.
Like what,

689
00:27:28,391 --> 00:27:33,391
what is like a realistic difference
between the early days of winning and to

690
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,070
just,

691
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,340
it's like a modern site clean.
I mean,

692
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:36,740
you have to look at when,
when,

693
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,020
you know,
the bike basically got to the,

694
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,850
you know,
the bikes and the wheels and these

695
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:42,320
things got to where they are today.
And,

696
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,450
um,
you know,

697
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,860
they're,
uh,

698
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,250
they're fast now.
I mean,

699
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,860
these guys are fast and that's the,
you know,

700
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,510
two things have happened.
Number One,

701
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,310
my story,
uh,

702
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,940
got exposed.
And so then people question everybody,

703
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,820
whether it's Chris froome who won the
Tour de France this year,

704
00:27:58,821 --> 00:28:00,560
or somebody that wins the world
championships,

705
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,990
they questioned them because of me.
And then they say,

706
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:04,221
well,
okay,

707
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:05,330
well,
you know,

708
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,550
he's dirty.
It seems like everybody's dirty,

709
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:10,100
so you must be dirty.
And then they go to the times,

710
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:10,880
right?
They look at,

711
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,250
they look at,
uh,

712
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,500
they look at my times in the Tour de
France and they look at the Peloton is

713
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:18,740
times and they see now that the times
are actually either the same or better.

714
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,371
So I said,
well,

715
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:22,160
then of course that that supports my
argument that you're dirty,

716
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,243
you know,
how's it?

717
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,530
Well,
if it's fat,

718
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,361
I mean,
I don't know.

719
00:28:26,361 --> 00:28:27,290
I mean it,
it,

720
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,000
I don't have the answer to that.
And I,

721
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:29,750
and I,
you know,

722
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,880
I get asked all the time what's going on
now or what's,

723
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,170
I said,
I have no idea.

724
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:36,290
I mean,
I'm so far removed from cycling that I

725
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:38,990
have no earthly idea of what's going on
or not going on.

726
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,850
But I don't think it's necessarily fair
to blame those guys.

727
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:45,230
I don't,
I understand it,

728
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,300
but,
um,

729
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,351
you know,
shit,

730
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,690
I mean,
you could have these athletes might be a

731
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:52,850
lot better.
The training might be a lot better.

732
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,860
I do think technology,
the bikes,

733
00:28:54,861 --> 00:28:57,920
the wheels,
even road surfaces are a lot better.

734
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,920
And

735
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,930
is there a,
is there any part of you that's kind of

736
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:04,140
pissed off that there are performance
enhancing drugs?

737
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,880
Like if there was nothing and if we just
had to be Mano a Mano,

738
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,000
same result,
you would have the same result.

739
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,520
I would have this,
it is my belief that

740
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,300
that the results would be the same.
There'll be a few seconds slower or

741
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:18,800
whatever,
whatever it would be.

742
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,480
It doesn't matter if the overall time
slower.

743
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,160
What matters is,
is,

744
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,020
is if you were five minutes ahead of the
next guy,

745
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,550
that's what matters.
That's what matters.

746
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,420
I,
that's my belief.

747
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,070
But there are others that don't hold
that belief.

748
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,670
There are others that say no,
I mean doping effects other individuals

749
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:37,290
differently.
And you know,

750
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,090
you,
you wouldn't know.

751
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,600
You might have one,
two or you might've went none.

752
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,140
What does that mean is that some people
weren't doping correctly,

753
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,620
but look at once you're doping,
if you're doping and the other guy's

754
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:48,760
doping better than you,
like,

755
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,590
well then you're not doing your job
doping.

756
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,840
You know,
you're not being a good competitive

757
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:54,760
doper bill.
But I mean,

758
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:55,780
that's really what it is,
right?

759
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,370
I mean,
doesn't it make sense?

760
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,421
Uh,
it's,

761
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,780
it gets complicated.
And W we would talk forever and,

762
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:04,210
and people would argue with us forever
about that.

763
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,820
So
they're not here,

764
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,630
you know,
I mean,

765
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,680
just who they are if you're listening.
But my perspective is,

766
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,120
is really clear on that.
I mean,

767
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:15,130
I think if you have a sport where
everybody's,

768
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,570
you know,
we were both talking about the bill

769
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,410
birth thing that he did on Conan,
which is like,

770
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:22,360
yeah,
our psychopath is Beth and you're a

771
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:23,680
psychopath.
You know?

772
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,990
That's,
that's really what it is.

773
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,750
You,
you can't say that.

774
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,390
I mean,
how could they take away,

775
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,940
this is one of the things that drove me
the craziest about this.

776
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,170
Like what did they do with the seven
years where you one where they said,

777
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,730
you're not the winter anymore.
Well,

778
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:42,370
who the fuck wanted then that's,
you know,

779
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,380
how do you,
how do you find the guy who wanted show?

780
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:45,214
That's,
that's,

781
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,200
that's a problem.
What's in the record books.

782
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:48,670
That's it.
It's empty.

783
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:49,750
Empty,
empty,

784
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,540
empty for seven years.
Yeah.

785
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,900
That's ridiculous.
Look,

786
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,000
I you you,
I agree with you,

787
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:03,070
but you can say that I cannot say that.
All I will say is that I don't,

788
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,990
I don't think it's
far be it for me to talk about what's

789
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,790
fair or not fair,
but I don't think it's fair for the

790
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:13,030
sport to leave those empty.
I think that's crazy.

791
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,720
And,
and compare and contrast.

792
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:16,120
So when the tour,
you have the Yellow Jersey,

793
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,570
he's the guy who wins.
You have the Polka Dot Jersey is

794
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,530
technically the best climber.
And then you have the Green Jersey who

795
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:27,531
was technically the best sprinter.
Those seven years were the Green Jersey

796
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:31,180
was one by Zabul who admitted to having
dope all seven of those years.

797
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,290
The polka Dot Jersey was,
was was one by veranique from France who

798
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,060
admitted to having dumped all those
years,

799
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,240
those all stand,
everything's still there.

800
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,360
That's hilarious.
But the Yellow Jersey has been erased,

801
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,621
you know,
second place,

802
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:46,420
third place.
All those places are still there.

803
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:48,800
The years,
the years prior to me where it's

804
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:51,850
somebody was,
he had admitted or was caught all still

805
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:54,310
there.
So there's just an asterisk in first

806
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:55,690
place.
You go to Wikipedia,

807
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,460
it's just there's just a line through
it.

808
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,570
Yeah.
That's so strange.

809
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,400
That's the word,
man.

810
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,780
It's strange.
It's very strange.

811
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:07,240
And it's strange for me and I it,
and it makes me,

812
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,190
it makes me sad because,
um,

813
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,261
uh,
I'm gonna look,

814
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:13,120
I'm gonna be honest.
I believe I won the races.

815
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,440
Um,
and I think,

816
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:14,711
well,
no,

817
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:17,020
you did win the races.
Now you won the race.

818
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,100
People to ask are the ones that got
beat.

819
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,630
Yeah.
So if you ask them,

820
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,380
right,
if you're asking Keon if you asked to do

821
00:32:24,381 --> 00:32:25,214
a left,
he asked,

822
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,100
uh,
below.

823
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,070
If you ask any of them,
they say he won those bike races.

824
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,740
And so,
man,

825
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,310
it,
it,

826
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,710
it,
you still have those yellow jerseys in

827
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:36,880
your house and I'd have to give them
back.

828
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,490
No,
good.

829
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,950
Fuck them.
She put it on an instagram picture of

830
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:42,170
him every day.
That was,

831
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,270
yeah,
that,

832
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,280
yeah.
I'm not going to put that picture up

833
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:48,650
again,
but that was a great picture though.

834
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,810
Oh,
you chilling on the couch at seven

835
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,820
yellow jerseys on your wall.
I got,

836
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,410
I got a note for that one.
Wow.

837
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,060
You're going to get new no matter what
you do.

838
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,240
But,
but I,

839
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,610
I look,
I mean,

840
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,890
they're up.
They're up and,

841
00:33:01,891 --> 00:33:02,724
uh,
and,

842
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,890
and I'm proud of them.
I really am.

843
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:06,840
And I'm proud of,
and that's the thing too,

844
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:09,810
is that as weird as it is,
and as strange as it is,

845
00:33:09,811 --> 00:33:12,630
that there's just a line through those
years as if they did not happen.

846
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,340
Um,
man,

847
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,350
I had,
I was paid to do a job,

848
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,240
right.
As messy as the job was,

849
00:33:18,241 --> 00:33:19,440
whatever.
I was paid to do it.

850
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:21,000
And I did it.
Uh,

851
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:24,120
and I wanted to win.
I wanted to capture those memories for

852
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:27,330
myself and for my teammates.
And you can't,

853
00:33:27,331 --> 00:33:31,260
nobody can take those away from me.
I still hold those memories to myself.

854
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:32,670
And,
um,

855
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,261
yeah,
it's,

856
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,190
it's,
it's had a complicated ending,

857
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:36,480
but,
um,

858
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,850
you know,
I still view those as victories and I

859
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:43,080
still view those memories is good.
The caring round,

860
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:46,770
the lie,
and being interrogated and questioned.

861
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:48,870
And it was that the hardest part about
all of it,

862
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,250
you know,
I was,

863
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,440
I was only interrogated are questioned
with the press and,

864
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,670
and even,
um,

865
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:58,661
you know,
God,

866
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,510
if it would have been in this day and
age with,

867
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,500
with,
with twitter and facebook and social

868
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,000
media and,
uh,

869
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,130
it would,
it would have been a thousand times

870
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:06,580
worse.

871
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,413
I mean,
this was,

872
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,280
you know,
I mean,

873
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,110
this was in the late nineties.
I mean,

874
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:13,180
think about that.
That was a long time ago.

875
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:17,620
And so the level of scrutiny while it
was high wasn't nearly as high as it

876
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:19,600
would have been today.
Um,

877
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,420
but
yeah,

878
00:34:22,421 --> 00:34:23,530
I mean,
once you dig in,

879
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:24,851
you know,
with these,

880
00:34:24,851 --> 00:34:25,661
with these guys,
you're,

881
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:29,560
you're stuck.
So once you finally came clean,

882
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,300
I mean,
obviously there was a lot of blow back,

883
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:35,750
but was there also a relief?
Um,

884
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,990
not,
not immediately.

885
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,131
Not immediately.
I mean,

886
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:40,850
I,
I,

887
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,980
uh,
I get asked that a lot and I think

888
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,640
people,
um,

889
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,270
people,
people expect me to say,

890
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:47,781
well,
you know,

891
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:50,480
it was just this,
it was just this huge relief off your

892
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:52,540
shoulders when you,
when you talked to oprah or you or

893
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,460
whatever you did that,
that you can now move forward and live

894
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,460
the life of an honest man and et Cetera,
et cetera.

895
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,670
But it's taken me,
let me just sum it up.

896
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:02,660
I mean,
sitting here today,

897
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:05,300
having this conversation,
I would much prefer to have this

898
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:09,500
conversation then the one where I would
align to your fucking face 15 times,

899
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,710
10 years ago,
I'd much rather us talk like this.

900
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,930
So that's,
that's a relief.

901
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,940
Um,
but it,

902
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,030
but it was,
you know,

903
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,360
it's not like I walked out of sitting
with Oprah and was like,

904
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,620
oh my God,
I feel amazing.

905
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,920
That was,
that was an ass weapon.

906
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,223
And,
uh,

907
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,830
so was it like sitting there with Oprah?
She's asking,

908
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:33,470
she's drilling you,
ask you questions about that start.

909
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,520
She came out,
she came out hot,

910
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,830
yes or no.
Yes or no.

911
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:37,940
The one,
yes or no.

912
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,830
That's it.
I thought she did a good job.

913
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,660
She did a great job.
I thought she did a good job.

914
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,620
I thought it was very compelling because
the way she structured the beginning

915
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:47,990
part of the conversation.
Yeah.

916
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,340
Especially if you're going to do
something like that on television.

917
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:52,030
You want to capture people and keep them
there.

918
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,670
You kind of have to approach it that
way.

919
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,900
I thought she did a good job.
I,

920
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,220
I don't,
I know that it wasn't well received and

921
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:01,770
I,
and I lean in what way?

922
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,870
You mean people didn't like you
afterwards and that way he wasn't low

923
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,890
risk.
I think there's two things.

924
00:36:07,891 --> 00:36:08,410
Number one,
I,

925
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,250
I wasn't emotionally ready to do that
interview.

926
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,180
I wasn't,
uh,

927
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:17,350
I wasn't in a place where I think that I
sit today where it's,

928
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:23,130
it is a position of contrition and
understanding the tremendous sense of

929
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:28,080
betrayal that's out there.
Like my perception of that today is much

930
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:30,570
sharper than it was three years ago when
I sat with her.

931
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,960
The feds and other lawsuits forced my
hand.

932
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:37,890
I had to sit there with that cause I
knew I was going to be sitting with her

933
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:41,760
or with you or with Tom Brokaw hall or I
was going to be sitting with a

934
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:45,780
government lawyer being deposed,
being videoed and being leaked.

935
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,340
So I said,
well,

936
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:49,320
I'm going to go,
I'm going to find the place that I'd

937
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:53,160
rather sit down and talk about this as
opposed to a grainy video that the

938
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:56,550
government leaks to the world and that's
your coming out party.

939
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,790
So I did that.
But the,

940
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:03,360
the thing about Oprah is,
is aside from me just not being ready at

941
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:04,710
the time to do it,
you know,

942
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,770
people sensed that.
But most importantly for the diehard

943
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,260
cycling fans and sports fans,
I didn't say enough.

944
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,880
You didn't name names.
He didn't,

945
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,060
you didn't call anybody out.
[inaudible] wasn't detailed enough.

946
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,860
You're holding back.
You're protecting people.

947
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:23,130
That's what they said.
That's a very small percentage of the

948
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:25,590
population for the majority of the
population.

949
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,950
Those first five minutes was way too
much information.

950
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:33,060
They were like,
what the fuck did I just hear?

951
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:38,310
Like blood bags hipo testosterone
transfusions,

952
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,590
cheating.
It was way too much.

953
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,510
So you had people that were at one camp,
a smaller camp said he didn't say it.

954
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,580
Now he's holding back here,
the other campus like,

955
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,593
all right,
that's,

956
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,020
that's more than I needed to hear.
And so everybody was pissed.

957
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,140
Well,
I don't know why they would think it's

958
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:55,040
too much.
I mean,

959
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:57,700
I don't know.
I don't understand that logic because it

960
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,080
is reality or grandma

961
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,360
duluth.
Right.

962
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,700
And,
and you and you supported the cancer.

963
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:02,820
So

964
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,000
survivor clause isn't real and you hear
that.

965
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,830
I mean,
you're sitting there going,

966
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,940
ah,
I don't,

967
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,950
I don't like anything about this.
So the,

968
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,170
uh,
so I see,

969
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,580
because they were also supporting lives,
drawing,

970
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,870
yeah.
Also supporting the stores.

971
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,430
How much of an effect did it have like
almost immediately on your foundation?

972
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,010
I don't know,
because I was asked to leave the

973
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:28,560
foundation before that and said,
and I haven't been back,

974
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,300
so I don't know.
And I'm not,

975
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,520
and I don't ask,
is it still around?

976
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:33,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

977
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,020
But it must've taken a devastating,

978
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,850
right?
I think so.

979
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,120
I mean it takes a hit in terms of,
uh,

980
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,420
obviously in terms of fundraising,
which directly leads to its,

981
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:47,860
you know,
its effectiveness in terms of helping

982
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,440
create change for cancer survivors are
all around the world.

983
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,420
You need to raise money in order to do
that.

984
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,600
Um,
staff layoffs.

985
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,040
Uh,
I mean,

986
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:57,781
you name it.
I mean it,

987
00:38:57,781 --> 00:38:58,890
it's uh,
but,

988
00:38:58,891 --> 00:39:02,650
but I don't,
I don't have specifics because once I

989
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:06,310
left the board and left the organization
and they legally changed the name,

990
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,280
I mean,

991
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,610
I dunno,
it,

992
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,100
none of it was shocking to me.
Um,

993
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,340
I mean,
I knew,

994
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,010
I didn't know,
but I knew that every,

995
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:18,320
I have a friend who was a professional
cycler,

996
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,660
just say his name is John Cyclist.
Cyclist.

997
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,040
Sorry.
We're going to get this right.

998
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,930
Let me see.
Okay.

999
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:25,400
People,
I'm going to write it down.

1000
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,260
Cyclist.
Yeah.

1001
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,590
He's up by,
some people say the ultimate fighting

1002
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:31,910
challenge.
It's championship.

1003
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,850
Um,
and see,

1004
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:36,110
I would say that.
Yeah,

1005
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,790
but challenge.
Okay.

1006
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,440
It's okay.
My friend John was a professional

1007
00:39:39,441 --> 00:39:40,550
cyclist.
Yup.

1008
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,420
And,
uh,

1009
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,750
this was,
uh,

1010
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,290
2000,
maybe three,

1011
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,183
three,
four.

1012
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,480
And,
um,

1013
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,010
he told me,
he was like,

1014
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,180
listen man,
we were all,

1015
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:51,710
we're all on it.
He goes,

1016
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,990
guys would get off the bus in the middle
of the night.

1017
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:57,380
You'd hear them taking off their bikes
and going for a ride because their blood

1018
00:39:57,381 --> 00:39:58,214
got too thick.

1019
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,280
There are those old stories.
Yeah,

1020
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,790
that's from EPL,
right?

1021
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,340
It,
that's a,

1022
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,410
yeah,
I've heard those stories.

1023
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,970
I never,
I never saw that,

1024
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,500
but well,
so my friend John,

1025
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,840
I mean maybe it was on the crazy team or
something like that.

1026
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,410
And back in the day before they got it
dialed in.

1027
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,303
Well,
what they,

1028
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,280
what happened was,
is there was no test,

1029
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,230
right?
So no sport had a test,

1030
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,420
whether it's cycling or swimming or
running or boxing or who,

1031
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,380
whatever sport is using epo.
They didn't have a test for EPO.

1032
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,410
And so they,
uh,

1033
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,231
and with,
you know,

1034
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:31,090
one of the side effects of epo or,
or you know,

1035
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,400
or increasing your red cell count is
your blood.

1036
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,490
It's,
it's literally a question of viscosity,

1037
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,470
right?
So all your oil and your hotel royal.

1038
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,071
Yeah.
Well,

1039
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:41,110
that's the only time you ever think of
the word viscosity,

1040
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:42,250
right,
is your motor oil.

1041
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:47,170
But more red cells means thicker blood.
Your blood is too thick.

1042
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:48,400
We know what happens.
It's not,

1043
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,670
it isn't a good thing.
And so the sport had to go to,

1044
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:54,610
they couldn't test for the science
wasn't there yet.

1045
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:57,760
So they went to these sort of
preventative screening methods,

1046
00:40:57,761 --> 00:40:59,890
right?
So then they started testing the

1047
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:02,050
viscosity or the thickness of people's
bloods,

1048
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,090
otherwise known as hematocrit.
Right?

1049
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,210
Um,
and so that they would use that as a

1050
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:10,360
screen.
Anybody above 50% hematocrit couldn't

1051
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:13,090
race that you weren't positive,
you didn't get banned,

1052
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,640
but you were put on the side for two
weeks as a,

1053
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:19,770
as a health measure,
anyone under 50% it was fine to race.

1054
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:21,220
So everybody took that is,
I mean,

1055
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:23,350
before that there were people that were
60,

1056
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:26,290
64%.
Those guys might be getting up in the

1057
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,190
middle of the night going for a little
spin,

1058
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,160
but at 50,
you know,

1059
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:32,800
they deemed that sort of the healthiest
level,

1060
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,060
you know,
but people pushed it right up to 50.

1061
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,890
Then there's,
and there's some side effects and

1062
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:40,250
there's some possible potential health
risks as far as like strokes and things

1063
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:41,330
along those lines.
I'm sure.

1064
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:45,080
Did anybody that was on the tour ever
dropped dead from epo?

1065
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,020
Well,
there's,

1066
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:47,970
there,
there was,

1067
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:48,631
you know,
look,

1068
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,820
they're there.
I don't know.

1069
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,460
I mean there are a lot of documented
cases,

1070
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,200
especially in the 80s,
right.

1071
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:58,080
When hipo I guess was first hitting the
scene.

1072
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,680
There was this wave of Dutch cyclists
that passed away in the night and you

1073
00:42:03,691 --> 00:42:04,650
know,
in the night,

1074
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:06,240
huh.
In their sleep.

1075
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,830
And that's probably when it would
happen.

1076
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,220
Well,
I dunno,

1077
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,551
I mean,
I,

1078
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:10,710
I,
I didn't,

1079
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,610
I didn't do the autopsy,
you know,

1080
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,310
nobody,
I don't know if anybody's ever proven

1081
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:14,820
that,
but that,

1082
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,010
that's sort of,
um,

1083
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,600
I don't want to say that was the myth,
but that was,

1084
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,730
uh,
that Eco,

1085
00:42:23,731 --> 00:42:25,560
the drug took the blame for those
deaths.

1086
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,740
And so it hasn't happened since and it
didn't happen,

1087
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,180
uh,
in,

1088
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,350
you know,
in our generation.

1089
00:42:31,351 --> 00:42:33,450
But
I don't know.

1090
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:37,950
But my point being that it can be fairly
dangerous.

1091
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,520
Well if,
well if your blood,

1092
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,620
yeah,
you can imagine if it gets to the SEC.

1093
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,890
So at that,
that would not be one of the things that

1094
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,830
it didn't surprise me that,
uh,

1095
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:51,210
when,
when you came clean,

1096
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,890
I was like,
well good for him.

1097
00:42:52,891 --> 00:42:54,690
That was really what I thought.
I was like,

1098
00:42:54,691 --> 00:42:57,600
it's kind of fucked up that he was lying
all this time and it's kind of fucked up

1099
00:42:57,601 --> 00:43:02,040
that he was suing people that were
saying that he was telling lies and,

1100
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,610
but one of the things that shocked me
the most,

1101
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:06,960
well,
I was thinking about it,

1102
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,320
was that you,
you had recovered from cancer.

1103
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,080
You had one of your testicles removed.
He had brain surgery,

1104
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,790
lung cancer.

1105
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:18,780
You mean your,
your body was ravaged by this and yet

1106
00:43:18,781 --> 00:43:21,460
you still were taking drugs.
Yup.

1107
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,520
That's,
that's what got me,

1108
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:27,570
I was like that what a crazy desire to
win that you,

1109
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,840
you got to this place where your body
was,

1110
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,290
you know,
you were on death's door and recover

1111
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:36,230
from it and then put yourself back and
wrist.

1112
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,870
Right?
Yup.

1113
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,670
I mean,
yeah,

1114
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,570
saying it like that it,
it,

1115
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,970
there's no,
there's no justifying that other than

1116
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,910
you,
I was in this sport that,

1117
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,440
that I really wanted to,
to,

1118
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:53,370
to be in and stay in and after the
disease I wanted to go back to,

1119
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:57,300
and that was the,
that was the landscape.

1120
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,560
And so you viewed it,
you thought,

1121
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:01,560
okay,
this is not ideal,

1122
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,940
but you asked the question,
what am I really,

1123
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,020
you know,
having,

1124
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:08,340
knowing my health history,
right,

1125
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:10,070
with cancer,
with all the,

1126
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:15,071
all that I went through is going back to
my sport and taking epo a risk to that,

1127
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:16,400
to that,
you know,

1128
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,780
to my,
to my disease or to my health.

1129
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,670
Um,
and I,

1130
00:44:20,671 --> 00:44:23,370
and the answer to that,
obviously my answer to myself was,

1131
00:44:23,371 --> 00:44:25,650
no,
you really didn't think that it was a

1132
00:44:25,651 --> 00:44:27,990
risk to push your body like that.
And,

1133
00:44:27,991 --> 00:44:32,991
and to put all these,
you mean stuff,

1134
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:37,170
they're there.
They're in a lot of ways,

1135
00:44:37,171 --> 00:44:41,640
they're pushing your body in an
unnatural way or to an unnatural level.

1136
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,920
Testosterone and human growth hormone
epo and all these and that.

1137
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:50,010
Sheila really,
and that's the only difference that that

1138
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:51,120
was made was,
I mean,

1139
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:56,121
I had a slight experience with growth
hormone before the disease and then

1140
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:58,530
after,
after the diagnosis and the treatment

1141
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:00,030
and recovery,
I said,

1142
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,511
okay,
that,

1143
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:02,370
that,
that does not sound like a good idea.

1144
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,510
It's too dangerous.
And perhaps in my own fucked up way,

1145
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:07,111
I was thinking,
well,

1146
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:11,750
that would lead to the growth of a,
have to have most of,

1147
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,200
you know,
a malignant cell,

1148
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:13,860
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1149
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,060
So,
um,

1150
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:17,850
but I didn't,
I didn't view those two the simplest.

1151
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:20,220
I don't,
I don't think hgh is for cycling.

1152
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:21,480
I don't think it's very effective
anyways.

1153
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:24,060
I think it's a waste.
Did you alter your diet?

1154
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,160
Well,
for sure.

1155
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,770
Yeah.
But what changes did you make when you,

1156
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:31,050
uh,
when you came back from having cancer?

1157
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,913
Man,
I was,

1158
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,440
and again,
this is the stuff that we can talk

1159
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:36,720
about.
I talked about forever and you know,

1160
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:38,910
and it's almost sort of mocked now.
You know,

1161
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:41,790
cause we talked about the change in diet
and the increased,

1162
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,130
you know,
intensity of training and the

1163
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:46,440
reconnaissance and the technology and
the wind tunnel.

1164
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:49,140
And we did all of those things and they
all worked,

1165
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,470
you know.
But I say their mock now because people

1166
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:54,150
now know the truth.
We all know the truth.

1167
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,020
And people say,
oh,

1168
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,780
he told us it was all that other
bullshit.

1169
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,190
He told us it was the training.
He told us it was his diet.

1170
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,960
Well now we know it was just the doping.
Um,

1171
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,130
well it wasn't though.
There's the doping end.

1172
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,440
That was the last,
that was the final piece,

1173
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,920
which just was unfortunately isn't it?
Was it,

1174
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,790
as we've said numerous times,
it's just an,

1175
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,310
it was unfortunate and it was
inevitable.

1176
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,880
Um,
but that was the final piece and the,

1177
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,350
and it was also the piece that we never
talked about.

1178
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,060
Of course,
of course.

1179
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:22,860
Yeah.
So this is the weight you're carrying

1180
00:46:22,861 --> 00:46:23,510
around.
I,

1181
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,760
I'm what I'm asking you about your die.
I literally didn't know that you had

1182
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,920
discussed this ad nauseum.
Yeah.

1183
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,570
So you're,
you're carrying this around.

1184
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:34,980
You're always assuming that if you look
at me racing in [inaudible] 96 before I

1185
00:46:34,981 --> 00:46:37,450
was diagnosed,
and then you look at me winning the tour

1186
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,540
[inaudible] 99,
I missed 20 pounds difference.

1187
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:43,590
So I mean,
I went and I had this when I got out of,

1188
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,280
uh,
sort of my cancer mission,

1189
00:46:47,281 --> 00:46:47,691
you know,
and,

1190
00:46:47,691 --> 00:46:49,350
and,
and recovered and took a year and a half

1191
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:51,660
away and went back.
I view,

1192
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,510
I mean,
I viewed racing bikes as life,

1193
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,830
life and death.
I viewed it,

1194
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,680
I viewed my disease as a,
as a competitive event,

1195
00:46:58,681 --> 00:47:01,440
as a sporting event.
It's me versus the opposition,

1196
00:47:01,441 --> 00:47:02,940
looking at the scoreboard,
how we doing.

1197
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,940
And then when I got to,
uh,

1198
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,570
when I got back on the bike,
it was,

1199
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:08,310
it was,
it was like life and death and so

1200
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:11,670
everything was intensified.
Starving yourself,

1201
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:14,310
training your ass off,
just being,

1202
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:18,120
as you said a minute ago,
just being generally fucking totally

1203
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:20,310
crazy for,
for a result.

1204
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,740
Mad,
not mad,

1205
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:25,020
but madness.
You were starving yourself to be

1206
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:25,860
lighter.
Yeah.

1207
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:30,100
Well that's part of it.
I mean these

1208
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,650
poor guys down and there,
there are a lot skinnier than we were.

1209
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:35,940
I mean this has guys ride in five,
six hours a day and not eating.

1210
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:38,050
I mean it just,
it just fucking sucks.

1211
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:40,990
How do they do it?
You don't eat this?

1212
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:41,710
Just,
just,

1213
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,540
just deal with it.
Just go to bed hungry.

1214
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,060
Wow.
Just to keep your body weight light.

1215
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:48,940
It's all power to weight.
Wish she were still,

1216
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,940
I wish I would like to know what the
fuck these guys are doing now.

1217
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:57,190
I would like to know when you see guys
with faster times and really

1218
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,800
ridiculously stringent drug testing.

1219
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,260
Yeah.
Well anytime I go anywhere near that I

1220
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:08,190
just get,
I just get destroyed because um,

1221
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:09,331
I don't know.
The,

1222
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:10,610
the,
the people view it as,

1223
00:48:10,611 --> 00:48:12,810
as me accusing them.
I mean I've,

1224
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,720
I've made,
cause I get a lot,

1225
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,290
a lot of questions.
Fall tweet backs.

1226
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,650
I don't ask me,
I have no idea.

1227
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,510
You know,
people take that as saying,

1228
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:19,021
well,
he just,

1229
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,240
he just blamed them.
He just accused them of doing the same

1230
00:48:21,241 --> 00:48:23,970
shit.
And I feel bad for those guys.

1231
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:26,040
Man.
I feel I feel bad for any top level

1232
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:31,020
rider that that is racing their bike in
2015 and has to answer questions about a

1233
00:48:31,021 --> 00:48:35,280
guy from 1999 like if I was winning in
[inaudible] 99 and what is that 16

1234
00:48:35,281 --> 00:48:36,720
years?
If somebody asks me a question about

1235
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:40,170
somebody from 1983 I said,
what the fuck are you talking about?

1236
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,080
Don't ask me that question.
Like why are you asking me?

1237
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,140
Well some do 20 years ago.
I'm here today.

1238
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,600
So,
but it's

1239
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:50,780
well that's the craziest thing about you
and the sport.

1240
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:55,670
You are inexorably tied to it.
There's no way to pull it away from you.

1241
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:59,420
Like that scandal was one of the,
at least in the United States,

1242
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,330
it was one of the biggest aspects of
that sport ever.

1243
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:04,100
It's still,
I mean it any,

1244
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,530
any,
any story that gets written.

1245
00:49:06,531 --> 00:49:08,630
I mean saw,
I don't if you fall of track and field

1246
00:49:08,631 --> 00:49:11,180
or all of this stuff that came out of
Ben Johnson,

1247
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,720
too old,
but there's,

1248
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:17,540
there was just this revelation that came
out of international track and field and

1249
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:21,410
the Russian Federation and the covers up
there and all of those stories that get

1250
00:49:21,411 --> 00:49:23,870
written,
whether it's on deadspin or the New York

1251
00:49:23,871 --> 00:49:27,500
Times or on twitter,
they all reference the story as well,

1252
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,330
so you get put back,
which is,

1253
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,670
I don't know if that's a good or a bad
thing,

1254
00:49:31,671 --> 00:49:32,790
but it just,
it,

1255
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,440
it brings people back to that,
you know,

1256
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,283
to my history.

1257
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,750
Yeah.
It's like it's baseball and Barry bonds

1258
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,670
and it's just,
there are tied,

1259
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:43,370
there's just no way they're going to,
you're going to separate the two of them

1260
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:44,204
together.
Yeah.

1261
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,353
It's,
it's,

1262
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:49,700
it's got to be a very bizarre thing for
those people that are racing.

1263
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,350
Hmm.
That's them.

1264
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,633
Yeah.
You should,

1265
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,310
don't want,
they don't want to,

1266
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,030
so he knows who they are.
That's the most fucked up thing about

1267
00:49:57,031 --> 00:49:57,980
it.
It's like you're like,

1268
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:04,270
I mean in a way like Tony Hawk is the
only skateboarder I have ever heard of.

1269
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:06,770
It's the only,
I mean I'm sure I've met a few other

1270
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:07,370
ones,
but I don't know.

1271
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,390
I don't remember their names.
Yeah,

1272
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,210
but Tony Hawk is that guy like you think
a skateboarding thing?

1273
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:13,610
Could Tony Hobbit,
you think of bike racing?

1274
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,790
I think of Lance Armstrong and now that
you think of swimming,

1275
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:18,110
you think of Michael Phelps?
Yeah.

1276
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,220
It's just,
yeah,

1277
00:50:19,221 --> 00:50:20,170
there's a few,
well,

1278
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,040
Greg Lamont is a diver.
You think of him,

1279
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:24,860
I guess he's kind of a swimmer.
These buttons on this.

1280
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,430
Greg,
Greg Gain Louganis sorry,

1281
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,870
I'm going to pay attention.
At least you said cyclist.

1282
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,490
I did.
I'm getting better.

1283
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,810
Greg.
Greg Lamont's probably like what the

1284
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:40,020
fuck?
Yeah,

1285
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:43,430
there's just,
it's weird when you have a sport that's

1286
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:47,720
where the public locks onto one person
and they don't know any of the other

1287
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:49,160
people.
And like if it's football,

1288
00:50:49,161 --> 00:50:52,910
there's like fucking hundreds of guys
boxing hundreds of guys.

1289
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:58,390
But with cycling there's just so few and
you carrying the weight of that sport in

1290
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:04,620
the United States.
Trying to popularize it and as well as a

1291
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,850
holding onto this lie.
Yep.

1292
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,431
Yup.
Yeah.

1293
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:10,264
Dope.
Yeah.

1294
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,810
I mean,
I mean that when I hear you say that,

1295
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,561
I mean it,
it,

1296
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:15,250
it,
it,

1297
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,190
and you may not be defending me,
but it sounds as if you're defending me.

1298
00:51:18,191 --> 00:51:20,540
So I don't,
I don't necessarily want,

1299
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:20,630
yeah.

1300
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,700
That I'm not defending you.
Right.

1301
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,420
What I'm doing and I'm trying to
aluminate reality in a pretty objective

1302
00:51:26,421 --> 00:51:27,230
way.
Well,

1303
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:30,840
you could do that on your next podcast
because me sitting here right now each

1304
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,910
uncomfortable,
no,

1305
00:51:31,911 --> 00:51:33,560
it doesn't make me uncomfortable,
but I,

1306
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,360
I'm,
I'm of the belief that nobody wants to

1307
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:37,950
hear that shit.
That there's still,

1308
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:41,160
I think people are upset.
I know they're upset.

1309
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,053
So

1310
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:43,730
some people do.
I mean,

1311
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:44,270
look,
did you get,

1312
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,470
you gotta have people that are upset?
Well,

1313
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,500
I think what we're dealing with when it
comes to the Internet is just a gigantic

1314
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:50,960
number of people.
There's too many people to like say,

1315
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:53,600
some people aren't this,
but he can't,

1316
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,690
he can't manage it.
There's hundreds of millions of people

1317
00:51:56,691 --> 00:52:00,260
who can get on their facebook or get on
the twitter and just start giving their

1318
00:52:00,261 --> 00:52:02,570
input right now.
And that's never happened before.

1319
00:52:02,571 --> 00:52:06,560
And when that happens,
you're going to be understandably

1320
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:08,210
sensitive to the outcome.
Yup.

1321
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

1322
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,220
What was the blow back like?
Like when you,

1323
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:16,160
when you did the oprah thing and then
you just went out into the public,

1324
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,410
did you just try to lay low for awhile?

1325
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,060
Yeah,
I tried to,

1326
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:20,894
well,
there was,

1327
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:26,560
there was several variations of quote
unquote blowback or there was just the

1328
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:28,970
public's perception.
So if I walked down the street,

1329
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:32,990
which I have to admit was,
was better than I expected.

1330
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:34,070
Right?
Peep nobody.

1331
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:37,620
It's not as if I left talking with Oprah
and I walked out on the street and you

1332
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,230
know,
people were throwing shit at me.

1333
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:39,860
I mean,
that just,

1334
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,020
that's never happened.
Could happen one day,

1335
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:44,270
but it hasn't yet.
There's the blow back,

1336
00:52:44,271 --> 00:52:46,880
which is the most important part,
which is the way my kids were treated.

1337
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,140
You know,
I've got five kids,

1338
00:52:48,141 --> 00:52:50,180
three older ones.
Um,

1339
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,390
you know,
I was very concerned with what they

1340
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:54,750
heard in the hallways,
you know,

1341
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:57,050
what they,
what they saw and their social media

1342
00:52:57,051 --> 00:52:58,610
stuff.
Um,

1343
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,030
you know,
what,

1344
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:02,990
what is,
what does that news due to them that is

1345
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:04,050
the most important thing.

1346
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:09,050
And it's a real credit to the city of
Austin and the schools that they go to

1347
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,540
our community and their friends and the
kids in the school very little blow

1348
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:14,331
back.
So that was,

1349
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:15,050
for me,
that was,

1350
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:17,630
that was like the biggest relief.
Like people can throw shit at me and say

1351
00:53:17,631 --> 00:53:21,410
shit all day long,
but if my kids were treated roughly,

1352
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,000
I mean,
that would just,

1353
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,210
that would break your heart when it,
I mean devastating.

1354
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:26,520
Yeah,
that'd be the,

1355
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,200
by far the worst.
So that was,

1356
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,830
um,
that was very fortunate that,

1357
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:32,880
that there was not seamless.
I mean,

1358
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:36,390
there was some stuff,
but they managed it and we managed it in

1359
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:37,620
the community,
managed it pretty well.

1360
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,410
And then there was the legal blow back,
which was,

1361
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,180
uh,
which was pretty nasty.

1362
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:42,501
I mean,
I,

1363
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:46,440
I got there as soon as I stepped off the
stage with Oprah,

1364
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,390
call it a stage,
um,

1365
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,600
the lawsuit just piled up and piled up
big.

1366
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,660
And how many of them are still ongoing
right now?

1367
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:55,800
Just one,
just one.

1368
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:58,880
One the federal government when the
federal case and the federal [inaudible]

1369
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,240
they were,
but there were,

1370
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,130
and some of them were,
were,

1371
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,310
were highly publicized.
Uh,

1372
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:07,620
and some were not some,
the problem,

1373
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,060
the team was,
uh,

1374
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,630
insuring all of my salaries and all of
my bonuses unbeknownst to me.

1375
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,000
And so because they didn't have the
money.

1376
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,480
And so when this goes down,
all of these companies came back and

1377
00:54:18,481 --> 00:54:19,314
said,
where's our money?

1378
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,041
And I said,
well,

1379
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:21,060
who are you?
I said,

1380
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:22,470
well,
we're so the team,

1381
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,990
I knew about one situation,
right?

1382
00:54:24,991 --> 00:54:26,220
The big one,
the SCA case,

1383
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,390
which,
uh,

1384
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,580
which has been settled since,
but there were many,

1385
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:31,710
many others and some were public,
some were private.

1386
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,260
Um,
but they all had to get settled.

1387
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:39,390
And so we've navigated that landscape
and now we're just down to the postal

1388
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:40,440
case,
the federal case.

1389
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,290
And when is that going to be resolved?
Um,

1390
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:46,110
that's a good question.
It's been going on a long time.

1391
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,760
Uh,
and it came on the heels of a two or

1392
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:54,090
three year criminal investigation,
which you're well aware of through

1393
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:56,600
there,
Jeff Novitsky and through the US

1394
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:00,030
Attorney's office here in Los Angeles.
So once that case was closed,

1395
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,390
then the civil division picked up the
postal case.

1396
00:55:03,391 --> 00:55:05,770
And it's been ongoing for years.
And,

1397
00:55:05,771 --> 00:55:06,170
and

1398
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,020
you know,
we sort of finished that first phase of

1399
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:14,021
litigation and that it'll go to trial
maybe a year from now in Washington DC.

1400
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:17,240
We talked about this very briefly before
the podcast.

1401
00:55:17,241 --> 00:55:18,890
We wanted to kind of save it for the
podcast.

1402
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,260
I don't understand the criminal
investigation.

1403
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:25,010
I don't understand the allocation of
resources towards someone who was bike

1404
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:28,820
racing.
I feel like in a world where we have

1405
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,930
bankers that causes gigantic 2008
financial collapse,

1406
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,200
we have pharmaceutical companies are
making billions of dollars.

1407
00:55:36,201 --> 00:55:41,201
Getting people hooked on Oxycontin is
when we have crime and murder and all

1408
00:55:41,331 --> 00:55:46,331
the fucking problems we have in this
culture to spend taxpayers' dollars on

1409
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:50,840
bike racing.
A guy who may have cheated or definitely

1410
00:55:50,841 --> 00:55:53,420
cheated in a sport where everybody's
cheating.

1411
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,750
Yup.
That seems kind of fun.

1412
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:56,510
Well,
you can,

1413
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,680
it's mccarthyism.
I mean,

1414
00:55:57,681 --> 00:55:59,490
you can have,
uh,

1415
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,580
first of all,
cyclists don't have any lobbyists.

1416
00:56:01,581 --> 00:56:05,120
Nobody's out protecting us.
W W W whatever we did or didn't do in

1417
00:56:05,121 --> 00:56:07,670
Europe 20 years ago,
the banks do,

1418
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:09,890
big Pharma does,
et Cetera,

1419
00:56:09,891 --> 00:56:13,550
et cetera.
So that's kind of a good old boys club

1420
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,750
that,
that we're not a part of.

1421
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,391
But,
and,

1422
00:56:16,391 --> 00:56:18,260
and we've talked about this offline.
I mean,

1423
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,840
when you,
when you have a federal agent in a guy

1424
00:56:20,841 --> 00:56:22,630
like Novitsky whose,
whose,

1425
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,050
he has made his career with these types
of cases,

1426
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:28,210
whether it's balco or bonds or Marion
Jones,

1427
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,160
um,
uh,

1428
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,110
when you have a guy like that,
that,

1429
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,440
that all of a sudden is interested,
it's gonna happen.

1430
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,130
You know?
And,

1431
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,630
and when you have that,
you know,

1432
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,930
particular agent or any agent that walks
into a interview,

1433
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:47,020
a witness or interview,
an old teammate with a badge and a gun,

1434
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,060
they're talking,
yeah,

1435
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:49,990
it gets weird,
right?

1436
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,480
Yeah.
They don't just kind of investigation.

1437
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:55,790
Yeah.
It's so of course you,

1438
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:56,350
I mean,
I know,

1439
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:57,430
I heard what you said.
Of course.

1440
00:56:57,431 --> 00:56:59,080
I don't think it makes much sense,
but I'm,

1441
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,870
I was at,
I was in the cross hairs.

1442
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,750
So people are going to say,
well,

1443
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,860
of course you don't think it makes
sense,

1444
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:04,400
but,
um,

1445
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,470
look,
I mean,

1446
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:06,490
uh,
and I,

1447
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:09,790
and I listened to your,
to your podcast with Novitsky and,

1448
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,770
uh,
I mean

1449
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,890
it's just,
uh,

1450
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,570
there's some bullshit in there.
And so what specifically,

1451
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:22,930
um,
you know,

1452
00:57:22,931 --> 00:57:24,430
I think the idea that,
that,

1453
00:57:24,431 --> 00:57:25,840
uh,
and I,

1454
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:26,770
and again,
I'm not,

1455
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,830
I don't work for the government.
I don't work for the US Attorney's

1456
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:31,840
office here,
but I think the idea that he was brought

1457
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:36,841
into the investigation,
I don't know that that's necessarily

1458
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:39,010
true.
I think,

1459
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,930
um,
I think,

1460
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,670
and again,
I don't know Jeff,

1461
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,850
but I think he went,
I think he looked for those cases.

1462
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:46,550
I mean,
he,

1463
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,310
and whether or not,
and by the way,

1464
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:50,980
when you're an agent for the food and
Drug Administration,

1465
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:52,990
I don't know how,
I mean,

1466
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:55,090
all of these things have missions.
He was,

1467
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:56,740
you know,
he was an agent for the irs.

1468
00:57:56,741 --> 00:57:58,570
And so then that's when balco and bond
started.

1469
00:57:58,571 --> 00:57:59,580
I don't,
I dunno,

1470
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:04,540
the doping and baseball as an irs issue.
I Dunno that doping in cycling 20 years

1471
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:06,190
ago is an issue for the FDA.
I mean,

1472
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:10,120
they regulate who makes aspirin and who
gives you your lettuce and your eggs and

1473
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:14,080
what does that have to do with,
but I think he,

1474
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,600
I think he was opportunistic when it
came to,

1475
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,770
uh,
these cases,

1476
00:58:17,771 --> 00:58:20,710
whether it's barry bonds or myself.
Um,

1477
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:21,681
and,
and,

1478
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:22,670
and you know,
he,

1479
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:24,070
he thrived on that.

1480
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,660
Well,
I think you look at it two ways in one

1481
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:30,230
on one hand,
he certainly capitalizes on these high

1482
00:58:30,231 --> 00:58:32,570
profile cases.
He certainly goes after that.

1483
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,870
I'm on the other hand,
him capitalizing and being the,

1484
00:58:37,871 --> 00:58:41,690
the rabbit investigator that he is,
it highlights the issues that are going

1485
00:58:41,691 --> 00:58:42,380
on.
Sure.

1486
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:45,120
So the,
I think the real problems,

1487
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,290
the allocation of money,
like how much money is being spent on

1488
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,520
these cases.
You know,

1489
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:53,870
he told me that the barry bonds case,
they only spent like $100,000.

1490
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,270
I didn't,
I didn't expect that.

1491
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:00,320
I didn't question them and I didn't
research it beforehand.

1492
00:59:00,321 --> 00:59:01,830
I didn't,
I didn't know that that was even going

1493
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:05,000
to come up.
But then once I did research it,

1494
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:08,510
it seems like it was a a fuck load.
More money than $100,000.

1495
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:09,291
Yeah.
Well that's,

1496
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:10,970
that's obviously that's laughable,
but,

1497
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:14,370
uh,
whatever the number was,

1498
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:14,910
it,
it,

1499
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:15,743
it,
you know,

1500
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,390
it wasn't a hundred thousand,
but it was,

1501
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,790
it was probably not as much as what was
reported.

1502
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,160
Um,
but

1503
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,480
hey,
that's a,

1504
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:27,260
that's the United States of America.
That's what they get to do.

1505
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,530
And also you get a guy like him,
and that's how these issues get

1506
00:59:30,531 --> 00:59:33,080
highlighted.
And that's why we know about it because

1507
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:37,790
he was so aggressive in his tactics.
He was so aggressive and chasing down

1508
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:40,010
anybody that he thought was doing these
drugs.

1509
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:43,940
That's why we know about these cases.
And it's such an extreme detail.

1510
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,310
Yup.
Yeah,

1511
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:47,781
yeah.
Man,

1512
00:59:47,781 --> 00:59:48,614
it was,
it was,

1513
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,690
it was,
it was,

1514
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,890
uh,
it wasn't pleasant watching that are

1515
00:59:51,891 --> 00:59:53,280
listening to that podcast.
I mean,

1516
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,600
and the fact that the,
I don't know if you're bullshitting me

1517
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:57,920
or not,
the fact that he wanted to do the

1518
00:59:57,921 --> 00:59:59,900
podcast with me.
Oh he did?

1519
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,060
Yeah.
He asked to do it.

1520
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,580
Well,
what kind of crazy is that?

1521
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,730
Well,
I think he wanted to find out like how

1522
01:00:07,731 --> 01:00:11,060
do we felt about it,
what it feels like now.

1523
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,170
You know,
he wants to,

1524
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,510
I mean it,
it needs ongoing.

1525
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,220
I mean,
he works right now doing drug

1526
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:20,240
investigations for the UFC and he's done
a fantastic job to the point where,

1527
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:23,810
as I was telling you before the podcast,
we've seen radical changes in fighters

1528
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:28,400
physiques and their performances.
Guys like guys who were world beaters

1529
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:33,401
have dropped off substantially.
There's the word in the mixed martial

1530
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:35,810
arts community.
When I talked to fighters,

1531
01:00:35,811 --> 01:00:38,600
when I talked to trainers,
he's had a gigantic impact and they're

1532
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,600
terrified because they've imposed these
very strict,

1533
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:45,300
uh,
fines and a probationary periods.

1534
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:48,040
Yep.
And as you also said before the podcast,

1535
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,290
I mean,
you have a sport where,

1536
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,280
you know,
the bigger and stronger your physically,

1537
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,590
the more you're pummeling somebody
else's head in.

1538
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,240
Yes.
It's different.

1539
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,120
It's different.
Yeah.

1540
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,600
It's different than his stall.
It is definitely different.

1541
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:03,020
I think it's much more,
it's much more important.

1542
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,400
Is this sport just as exciting?
It's pretty damn exciting.

1543
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,430
So it's hard to say if it's just as
exciting or not.

1544
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:14,000
Cause I think there's a lot of great
fighters who were world champions who

1545
01:01:14,001 --> 01:01:16,010
are clean cut.
It's just a,

1546
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,870
it's like some of the all time greats.
I mean,

1547
01:01:17,871 --> 01:01:20,450
there's great guys right now,
Frankie Edgar clean as a whistle.

1548
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,100
Chris Weidman,
very clean,

1549
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,830
rockhold clean,
who's the new champion in the

1550
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:26,810
middleweight division.
There's a lot of great fighters that are

1551
01:01:26,811 --> 01:01:28,430
clean.
It's a,

1552
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:30,680
um,
it's hard to tell.

1553
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,450
There's a lot of fighters who weren't
clean,

1554
01:01:32,451 --> 01:01:34,820
who are fucking awesome when they
weren't clean.

1555
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,440
Vito Belfort,
who,

1556
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:39,040
uh,
went on this wild run for like a,

1557
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:43,850
at 36 years old when he a w they had,
this is one of the apartments.

1558
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,870
One of the big problems with the UFC was
that they had legal testosterone

1559
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:52,160
replacement for a short period of time
for a few years and guys were just

1560
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:54,260
fucking juice into the tits.

1561
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,550
They didn't like it was skittles.
Oh,

1562
01:01:55,551 --> 01:01:58,880
they would come back with these hyper
human level so that they would test them

1563
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,430
and you know,
like a normal person in your

1564
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:05,060
testosterone level would be like a low
three,

1565
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:06,680
high eight,
800.

1566
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:12,130
Vito was like 1,475 and he looked like a
fucking silver back and just hyper

1567
01:02:13,191 --> 01:02:14,750
aggressive,
super confident.

1568
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:15,950
That's different,
you know,

1569
01:02:15,951 --> 01:02:17,060
that's,
that's dangerous.

1570
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:20,310
And winning and beating guys to,
you know,

1571
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,390
to a pulp,
right.

1572
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,570
That's a,
that's a different situation.

1573
01:02:24,571 --> 01:02:25,860
It's it,
you know,

1574
01:02:25,861 --> 01:02:28,190
you're not talking about an extreme
endurance sport like that.

1575
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:32,160
Like that kind of aggression and
explosion wouldn't benefit you in

1576
01:02:32,161 --> 01:02:34,890
cycling because it's such a long
endurance race.

1577
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:38,880
And also the,
the benefit isn't the end result is in

1578
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:42,510
someone,
someone's health doesn't get compromised

1579
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:43,344
by it.
Yup.

1580
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,363
Yeah.
So,

1581
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:45,920
yeah.
So I mean that's,

1582
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:49,820
I don't know that sport that well and,
and I don't know what people's feelings

1583
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:51,920
are in and amongst the sport.
I mean,

1584
01:02:51,921 --> 01:02:53,570
you just give a pretty good perspective
on it.

1585
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:54,404
So,
uh,

1586
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:55,970
more power to him there.

1587
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:59,290
It's just,
it's messy to pull it out.

1588
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:04,350
It's messy because it was so pervasive.
It's like if they had figured out it's

1589
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,030
if,
if the tour,

1590
01:03:07,031 --> 01:03:10,090
if half the guys were clean and half the
guys were dirty,

1591
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:14,680
the Tour de France,
and then they figured out how to pull

1592
01:03:14,681 --> 01:03:17,440
the drugs out from half,
it would be messy.

1593
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,670
Right,
because then it'd be like,

1594
01:03:18,671 --> 01:03:19,401
okay,
well why?

1595
01:03:19,401 --> 01:03:21,790
What happened?
Why were these guys doing so well and

1596
01:03:21,791 --> 01:03:23,950
now they're not the guys who are winning
or not winning,

1597
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:28,030
but if they,
the tour seems like it's so pervasive

1598
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,910
that if they pull the drugs out,
the same guys would be winning the

1599
01:03:30,911 --> 01:03:31,830
times.
It'd be slower

1600
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:33,700
but,
but what happened?

1601
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:38,860
What happened was primarily I guess the
Dude Novitsky his investigation,

1602
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:43,861
which which when was closed,
he more or less handed everything to you

1603
01:03:43,971 --> 01:03:45,970
saw it,
you saw the picked up the investigation

1604
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,690
and then they acted.
They gave me the lifetime ban that left,

1605
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:55,030
like when the world reads that in 2012,
it was the summer of 2012 the world

1606
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:58,420
reads that the impression is,
or when I do oprah,

1607
01:03:58,421 --> 01:04:00,400
for example,
which has three or four months later,

1608
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:04,390
the impression is that we were hanging a
blood bag six months ago.

1609
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,940
Like it's a current event.
It feels,

1610
01:04:06,941 --> 01:04:11,941
although it had been,
it had been seven years before any line

1611
01:04:12,131 --> 01:04:14,800
had ever been crossed ever,
even during the compact.

1612
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,470
So,
but it made it current.

1613
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:20,950
The comeback made it current for people.
Novitsky investigating,

1614
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:23,650
uh,
getting everybody to speak through his

1615
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,330
own tactics.
Um,

1616
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,390
it made it a current event when it,
when it really,

1617
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:29,350
it really wasn't.

1618
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:31,120
It's like,
it's like,

1619
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:33,190
uh,
I remember sitting there in 2012

1620
01:04:33,191 --> 01:04:35,590
thinking,
or the shit's going down.

1621
01:04:35,591 --> 01:04:37,600
This is,
this is unbelievable.

1622
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,390
Being in the middle of it being me,
this is unreal.

1623
01:04:40,391 --> 01:04:42,580
And I thought,
you know,

1624
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:45,190
and,
and we're talking about 1999 through

1625
01:04:45,191 --> 01:04:46,850
2005,
but let's use 99 as,

1626
01:04:46,851 --> 01:04:49,660
as an example.
I remember thinking to myself,

1627
01:04:49,661 --> 01:04:52,140
who won the superbowl in [inaudible] 99
and it was the,

1628
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,480
the broncos and elway was the MVP.
I remember thinking to myself,

1629
01:04:55,481 --> 01:05:00,481
what if I open the paper today and the
NFL is opened a case against John La in

1630
01:05:00,911 --> 01:05:03,280
2012.
I would have read that and gone,

1631
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,570
this is a joke,
right?

1632
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:05,410
He said,
April fools.

1633
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:07,880
Like what the fuck?
It isn't like an old guy who stands on

1634
01:05:07,881 --> 01:05:09,200
the sideline now.
Like,

1635
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:12,880
so it just,
they were able to go way,

1636
01:05:12,881 --> 01:05:14,300
way back and,
and,

1637
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:19,310
and sidestep and ignore any sort of due
process and statute of limitations and

1638
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,210
they made it a current event.
I'm not,

1639
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:24,340
I'm not blaming them or defending
myself.

1640
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:27,410
I'm just telling you what happened.
And uh,

1641
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:28,660
you know,
that,

1642
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:31,150
you know,
is not totally accurate,

1643
01:05:31,151 --> 01:05:31,460
but

1644
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,310
well,
it's because it was so long.

1645
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:38,090
It went on for so long.
Like you remember they had that Nike

1646
01:05:38,091 --> 01:05:41,600
commercial when that Nike Commercial,
when you were doing it live strong Nike,

1647
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:44,570
Nike commercial and you're,
you're riding your bike and you're

1648
01:05:44,571 --> 01:05:46,290
talking about people calling you a
doper.

1649
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,410
This is before you had come clean.
That was in 2000 yeah.

1650
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:50,810
And this is,
this is before,

1651
01:05:50,811 --> 01:05:53,180
you'd never failed any tests.
There was not,

1652
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:56,480
but you still had to address it in a
fucking Nike commercial.

1653
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,710
Yeah.
So this was,

1654
01:05:57,711 --> 01:05:59,990
this was something that was,
it was ill advised.

1655
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:01,423
Yeah,
it seems,

1656
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:04,490
but that's again,
I mean all of this,

1657
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,280
whether it's

1658
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,750
agreeing to that commercial or the way
you treated,

1659
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,550
I needed,
you know,

1660
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,420
somebody in my life to go,
I,

1661
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,220
I,
I just read this script or this

1662
01:06:17,221 --> 01:06:19,290
storyboard and I think that's a real bad
idea.

1663
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,750
But did you have anybody like that in
your life?

1664
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,770
Well,
clearly not,

1665
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:25,140
but did anybody suggest it?
No.

1666
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,490
No one but no.
But,

1667
01:06:26,491 --> 01:06:27,420
but I was,

1668
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,220
but isn't that hard though,
because you're such a fucking winner.

1669
01:06:30,221 --> 01:06:31,870
You're lucky you're on top of that
world.

1670
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,280
Nobody wants to say,
hey man,

1671
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:33,880
don't do that

1672
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,280
dude.
It's like when you're,

1673
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,370
when you're in that position,
nobody,

1674
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:40,810
everybody's saying yes,
yes,

1675
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,501
yes,
of course.

1676
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:42,790
Yes.
That's a great idea.

1677
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:43,720
Yes.
Lance.

1678
01:06:43,721 --> 01:06:44,950
Yes,
absolutely.

1679
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:46,660
Right now,
yes.

1680
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:48,640
It.
Then nobody's sitting there playing the

1681
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:50,830
devil's advocate or saying,
I think that's a bad idea.

1682
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:53,580
There's,
I didn't have that north star man and,

1683
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:54,400
and again,
I'm not,

1684
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,530
the fucking buck stops with me,
man.

1685
01:06:57,330 --> 01:07:00,300
I should have been mature enough and
worldly enough to go

1686
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,790
bad idea.
Let's make another commercial are bad

1687
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:04,451
idea.
Lance.

1688
01:07:04,451 --> 01:07:06,310
Let's say something else in the next
press conference.

1689
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:09,070
But it seems like the,
the weight of it all in the air of it

1690
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:13,660
all was so thick that you kind of had to
address it all the time because it was

1691
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,910
being thrown at you all the time.
I was,

1692
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:20,740
I peripherally watched cycling
peripherally and I knew about it.

1693
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,710
Everyone knew about it right on

1694
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:22,700
it,
but,

1695
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:27,230
but it,
but the more defensive I became and the

1696
01:07:27,231 --> 01:07:30,380
more aggressive I became in the denials,
all that does,

1697
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:32,270
right,
is what it might a piece.

1698
01:07:32,271 --> 01:07:34,220
Some people are support is good lad.
Did you,

1699
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,850
I heard it in his voice.
I believe that.

1700
01:07:37,851 --> 01:07:41,300
But what it really did,
especially with the press was it just,

1701
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:46,400
it just made the next occasion,
the next question,

1702
01:07:46,401 --> 01:07:49,670
the next episode even more inevitable.
Like it just,

1703
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:53,060
it added fuel to that fire.
Like you know,

1704
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,580
looking back in hindsight,
I should've just said like,

1705
01:07:55,581 --> 01:07:59,210
I'm not going not gonna talk about it or
whatever the answer was.

1706
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,070
But instead of saying,
you know,

1707
01:08:01,071 --> 01:08:03,800
it was literally like finger in your
chest,

1708
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:08,810
fuck you don't ask me that.
I mean that is when you're guilty.

1709
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,960
That's a real bad approach and it's the
one that I took and quite honestly it's,

1710
01:08:16,311 --> 01:08:18,280
you know,
probably one of the main reasons that,

1711
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:20,000
that we're sitting here today talking
about this.

1712
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,970
Why do you think you took that approach
when looking back on it?

1713
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:28,160
Because I,
because that is the approach that I took

1714
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:32,270
and training and in racing and even,
I mean these are guys that I raced

1715
01:08:32,271 --> 01:08:34,670
against that I liked,
but I would make up reasons to fucking

1716
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:36,380
hate him.
Like I'd read something and be like,

1717
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:39,230
look at this asshole.
Did you read what he's,

1718
01:08:39,231 --> 01:08:40,640
I mean he probably didn't even say
anything.

1719
01:08:40,641 --> 01:08:42,170
I'd take it.
I'd be like,

1720
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,260
I can't believe he said just as fuel.
Just his motivation.

1721
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:48,740
So that's all fine and good when you're
training and your racing.

1722
01:08:48,741 --> 01:08:52,250
And you're competing,
but when you step off the bike that you

1723
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:53,720
have to have that switch to say,
okay,

1724
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,570
that's been done.
You won the written,

1725
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,440
don't,
we're not going to go treat another

1726
01:08:57,441 --> 01:08:58,760
human being that way.
Right.

1727
01:08:59,030 --> 01:08:59,863
And,
and just uh,

1728
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,690
in a professional context or in a press
context,

1729
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:04,580
you gotta turn it off,
man.

1730
01:09:04,581 --> 01:09:06,380
And I couldn't,
like I was,

1731
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:09,560
I had my finger in people's chest on the
bike,

1732
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:11,750
off the bike everywhere.
And so

1733
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:14,270
my bad dude,
I mean,

1734
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:15,860
I,
I didn't have the,

1735
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:18,410
the ability to turn that off.
I mean,

1736
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:21,740
it's good to be a competitor,
but it's not good to be too competitive.

1737
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,980
And once you start,
once you took that approach,

1738
01:09:24,981 --> 01:09:27,890
once you started with that approach,
did you feel like there was like a

1739
01:09:27,891 --> 01:09:32,390
weight of momentum behind you?
Like to dig your heels in and stop it

1740
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,570
and try a new approach would be very
difficult.

1741
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:36,270
Well,
yeah,

1742
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:37,830
once,
once it gets rolling,

1743
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:40,100
it's,
it's tough to ducted.

1744
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:41,860
Halter,

1745
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:44,680
what was it like with the people that
you were close to?

1746
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,630
Obviously the people that you trained
with,

1747
01:09:46,631 --> 01:09:49,690
they knew what you were doing,
but what about your family and your

1748
01:09:49,691 --> 01:09:52,060
close friends?
How many of them were aware of what was

1749
01:09:52,061 --> 01:09:52,730
going on?

1750
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:56,420
I think by and large,
I don't know.

1751
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,730
I wouldn't have asked him and they
wouldn't have asked me.

1752
01:09:58,731 --> 01:10:01,160
I think it was sort of this to your
friends.

1753
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:02,240
Never add any land,
man.

1754
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:04,280
Come on.
I think it's more donate ever pulled you

1755
01:10:04,281 --> 01:10:05,091
aside?
Don't ask.

1756
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:06,070
Don't tell.
Really.

1757
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:07,620
Yeah,
probably.

1758
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,520
You know they probably didn't.
They didn't want to know.

1759
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,440
Do you have close friends outside of
cycling?

1760
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,870
Yes.
And they didn't ask you?

1761
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:17,240
Yeah.
Well no they didn't,

1762
01:10:17,241 --> 01:10:19,640
but really,
I mean they might also ride bikes so

1763
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:21,000
they're not in the sport,
but,

1764
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:24,500
but yeah,
nobody sat at the bar.

1765
01:10:24,501 --> 01:10:25,071
I was like,
dude,

1766
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:26,310
come on.
Yeah,

1767
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,500
no one.
No.

1768
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:30,710
Wow.
That's fucking crazy.

1769
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,150
If I was your friend,
dude,

1770
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:33,890
I would've got you fucked up.
I was just going to say,

1771
01:10:33,891 --> 01:10:35,330
you got you drunk.
I'm like,

1772
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:36,660
come on dude,
we're going on a hike.

1773
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:37,850
You're Joe Joe,
Joe.

1774
01:10:37,851 --> 01:10:38,940
We'd be talking about it now.
He's like,

1775
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:40,640
I would have,
I remember that time I got him all

1776
01:10:40,641 --> 01:10:44,510
fucked up and he admitted it.
I would've never said a word until you

1777
01:10:44,511 --> 01:10:46,340
came out.
Once he came out,

1778
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:49,490
then I woulda told until the guy with
the badge and the gun showed up and then

1779
01:10:49,491 --> 01:10:52,540
you would have said everything.
I would have ducked Jeff Novitsky.

1780
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,540
Yeah.
No,

1781
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,200
I would have hired some lawyers.
I believe.

1782
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,020
You got to sit with me when this guy
comes in.

1783
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,700
What's going on?
What do you want to know?

1784
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:02,350
Nobody bike racing mocked it.
Nobody bike.

1785
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:05,220
Bike racing like a kid's bike and what?

1786
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:07,820
You have a gun?
Someone stealing bikes?

1787
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,710
No,
they're the killing people with bikes.

1788
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:12,260
The fuck's going on with that gun?
Yeah.

1789
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,400
What happens in these podcasts when,
when?

1790
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,920
When the interviewee has to take a leak.
You go take a leak,

1791
01:11:16,921 --> 01:11:17,401
man.
Don't worry.

1792
01:11:17,401 --> 01:11:19,770
What happens to the podcast?
We'll just pause it for a second.

1793
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:21,840
What about the people at home?
I'll talk to them.

1794
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:22,591
Don't worry about,
oh yeah,

1795
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:24,000
that's right.
You're also here too.

1796
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:24,810
Don't worry about it,
man.

1797
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,760
Go take a leak.
Happens all the time.

1798
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:27,653
It's no big deal.
Really?

1799
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:28,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

1800
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:28,790
Okay.
Yeah.

1801
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:29,890
All the time.
Don't sweat.

1802
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:30,631
Well,
I'm going to go take it.

1803
01:11:30,631 --> 01:11:31,590
Go take a leak.
Please do.

1804
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:33,750
Just one thing about athletes,
they drink.

1805
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:36,330
Fuck loads of water lenses here
pounding.

1806
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:39,600
He's hung over to,
here's a very specific schedule.

1807
01:11:39,601 --> 01:11:42,000
He told me he drinks two cups of coffee
in the morning.

1808
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:45,840
Then it takes a shit and he drinks water
all day and then he waits until about

1809
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:47,070
five,
about five.

1810
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:47,943
Then he started drinking.

1811
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,640
That's a good drug.
I was going to ask him about marijuana

1812
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:57,600
cause if he smoked marijuana and he was
holding in all those lies,

1813
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:01,200
that shit would fuck with you.
Like I'll smoke some weed and uh,

1814
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,490
I'll think about a lie.
I told them highschool,

1815
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,660
I don't fuck with me
really well.

1816
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,870
I'll think about some shit that I did in
high school and make me go,

1817
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:12,450
oh,
why the fuck did I say that?

1818
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:16,140
Like it net.
That's the one of the crazy things about

1819
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:19,990
marijuana and never lets you forget.
It'll bring those things up to you

1820
01:12:19,991 --> 01:12:21,630
trying to hide.
But alcohol.

1821
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,490
Alcohol is like,
Eh,

1822
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:26,850
don't worry about it.
Buzzy alcohol is the best drug.

1823
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,780
If you're trying to hold back a lie,
just throw that down.

1824
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:33,240
And you know,
as soon as you can't walk straight,

1825
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:35,100
you're thinking about that.
As soon as you're,

1826
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:35,820
you know,
you're,

1827
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,760
you're thinking about the song was
playing,

1828
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:41,160
you're thinking about your whatever
you're thinking about other things.

1829
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,910
It's good.
It's a good close your focus drug.

1830
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:49,140
Whereas pot is the opposite.
Pot is a open your focus.

1831
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:52,020
This is fascinating though,
isn't a Jamie forget you have a secret.

1832
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:53,220
Yeah.
You forget.

1833
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,780
You don't give a fuck about your
secrets.

1834
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,630
I mean,
that's why people make horrible sexual

1835
01:12:57,631 --> 01:13:00,150
decisions when they're drunk.
You know?

1836
01:13:00,151 --> 01:13:02,400
I mean,
it's also why people think that people

1837
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:04,950
that are drunk shouldn't,
you shouldn't have sex with someone

1838
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:06,570
who's drunk,
even if you're drunk.

1839
01:13:06,571 --> 01:13:08,700
I mean,
that's why they're the crazy feminist

1840
01:13:08,701 --> 01:13:11,820
tried to say that that's rape and ended
up man and woman have sex in there

1841
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:13,610
drunk.
It's rape while they say it.

1842
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:16,950
Because you're obviously not exactly of
sound.

1843
01:13:16,951 --> 01:13:19,620
I mean it depends on how drunk you are,
right?

1844
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,430
But at a certain level,
you're certainly impaired and you can't

1845
01:13:23,431 --> 01:13:25,960
make good decisions.
It's like,

1846
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,820
it's funny though,
that a guy who was just such a,

1847
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,430
an athlete,
lifelong athlete,

1848
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,560
fucking pounds,
UCC like that.

1849
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:36,450
And ask him how long does it,
we were talking about marijuana and

1850
01:13:36,451 --> 01:13:37,320
whether or not,
uh,

1851
01:13:37,321 --> 01:13:41,490
you used marijuana while you were a
holding back all those lies and how it

1852
01:13:41,491 --> 01:13:42,890
would fuck with you.
Because when I was,

1853
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:46,230
I'll think I'll get high and I'll think
about some shit I lied about in high

1854
01:13:46,231 --> 01:13:48,070
school and it will go like,
oh,

1855
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:54,210
paranoia.
And it'll illuminate areas of your life

1856
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:55,460
that you're trying to,
uh,

1857
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:56,940
avoid.
Hmm.

1858
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:01,360
Hmm.
The economy of all this is a fascinating

1859
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:06,380
aspect of it because there were a lot of
people that were making money off of you

1860
01:14:08,971 --> 01:14:12,880
racing a lot of people.
There's a gigantic industry.

1861
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:18,090
And for them to pretend that they didn't
know what I knew as a fucking comedian

1862
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,820
who w again,
peripherally watch cycling,

1863
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:23,980
you know,
I'd watch you win and I be like,

1864
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:25,330
damn,
that motherfucker want again.

1865
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:26,950
Damn.
That's it.

1866
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:27,950
You know,
I mean,

1867
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,130
I'd,
I'd never raced raced bikes.

1868
01:14:30,131 --> 01:14:33,460
I never rode bikes is so for me and I
knew,

1869
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:34,601
you know,
I'm like,

1870
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:37,240
how the fuck does the US post office not
know?

1871
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,510
How the fuck does Nike not know how the
fuck does they know?

1872
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:41,590
They know.
They know.

1873
01:14:41,591 --> 01:14:44,320
They can pretend they don't know,
but they know if they didn't,

1874
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:49,210
if they didn't know then they're
irresponsible.

1875
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:53,800
It's irresponsible.
But they kind of knew and they just

1876
01:14:53,801 --> 01:14:54,640
said,
it's all right.

1877
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:56,980
We're getting away with it.
We are getting away with it.

1878
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:00,520
But then once the shit came down,
then they all wanted their money back.

1879
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,020
Yeah.

1880
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:01,853
Well

1881
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,950
that's a weird aspect.
You can't talk too much about this,

1882
01:15:06,951 --> 01:15:07,471
right?
That one.

1883
01:15:07,471 --> 01:15:09,500
Yeah.
I wouldn't get sensitive for the post

1884
01:15:09,501 --> 01:15:10,550
office one.
Tricky.

1885
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,190
Definitely toughest one.
I know you can't talk about it,

1886
01:15:13,191 --> 01:15:18,191
but can you talk about this is this is a
reality when you are accused of

1887
01:15:18,411 --> 01:15:22,550
defrauding the federal government,
which is what they're saying because you

1888
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:27,551
were riding for the US post office,
that was the team and you won x amount

1889
01:15:28,251 --> 01:15:29,950
of money during that time.
They,

1890
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:33,350
they can sue you for three times that
money.

1891
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:34,960
Correct.
Right.

1892
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:40,060
So they want a hundred million bucks.
Yeah.

1893
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:44,150
A lot of money.
How's that going?

1894
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,780
That's uh,
you know,

1895
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:48,910
honestly it didn't,
that's it.

1896
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:51,670
That's the only active case.
So that one does get a little trickier

1897
01:15:51,671 --> 01:15:53,430
to talk about just from a,
uh,

1898
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:56,140
uh,
I don't want to be crushed by my

1899
01:15:56,141 --> 01:15:58,960
lawyers,
but we like our case.

1900
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:01,390
W W we think that,
uh,

1901
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:03,640
we're,
we're confident in the case.

1902
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:08,080
We believe that the postal service a
while none of this story is,

1903
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:09,040
is,
uh,

1904
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:11,650
is perfect.
Um,

1905
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,620
we believe that the postal service and
the,

1906
01:16:13,621 --> 01:16:16,750
and their own numbers support it.
I mean the Postal Service Commission

1907
01:16:16,751 --> 01:16:20,230
three separate studies to,
to analyze the effect of the sponsorship

1908
01:16:20,231 --> 01:16:21,650
on the team.
Uh,

1909
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:24,600
we believe they made hundreds of
millions of dollars and,

1910
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:28,600
and we know that they were also using
the team as a sales vehicle.

1911
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:33,490
So coming to the two during the tour,
bringing over potential new clients,

1912
01:16:33,491 --> 01:16:37,030
bringing over new clients there were
actually converting their business to

1913
01:16:37,031 --> 01:16:39,370
the postal service.
We know that happened and we know that

1914
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:42,580
equaled a significant increase in
revenue.

1915
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:46,900
So we like our case,
I mean,

1916
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,431
and,
and,

1917
01:16:47,431 --> 01:16:49,570
and at this point,
uh,

1918
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:51,880
what I like to have all legal issues out
of my life.

1919
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:55,180
Yes.
But settlements not an option.

1920
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:59,380
And so we have to just fall back on what
we think is the strength of the case.

1921
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:03,820
Does that,
if they made a ton of money while you

1922
01:17:03,821 --> 01:17:08,470
were being dishonest,
does that exonerate you from owing the

1923
01:17:08,471 --> 01:17:09,710
money?
Like how does that work?

1924
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,050
Well,
I'm not a lawyer,

1925
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:13,420
right?
My view of,

1926
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:15,500
of of uh,
it's called a key tm case,

1927
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:17,960
which is a false claims case.
My view is,

1928
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:19,940
is,
and I think is one that,

1929
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,480
that our side shares is it's about
damages,

1930
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,590
right?
When was the postal service damaged and

1931
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:31,370
what can we prove to be the damages?
And uh,

1932
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,800
you know,
if there are no damages,

1933
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:38,210
then I would like to think then there
was no case.

1934
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:41,330
But it's,
it is what it is.

1935
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:44,780
The federal government is interested in.
The Department of Justice is interested

1936
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:46,520
in the case.
Uh,

1937
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:48,350
and we,
and I have no choice but to fight it.

1938
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,491
Uh,
I don't,

1939
01:17:49,491 --> 01:17:51,860
I don't have,
after the,

1940
01:17:51,861 --> 01:17:53,720
you know,
the dozen previous lawsuits,

1941
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:56,840
I'm not in a position to,
to really cut any more checks.

1942
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:59,660
And so I'm in a position where I have to
go,

1943
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,130
I have to go fight this one out.

1944
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:06,260
How do you get by financially now?
Um,

1945
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,450
well the,
the first thing that,

1946
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:11,150
that I did was,
was,

1947
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,670
and I,
and I saw this coming into this,

1948
01:18:13,671 --> 01:18:15,290
what's going to happen is your life was
big.

1949
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,280
I mean,
a three houses.

1950
01:18:16,281 --> 01:18:17,390
We had a jet.
I mean we had the whole,

1951
01:18:17,391 --> 01:18:19,880
so you just take that burn rate way
down.

1952
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:21,910
So you just,
you're,

1953
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,540
your overhead goes way down.
And you know,

1954
01:18:24,541 --> 01:18:25,820
the,
the crazy thing is,

1955
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,160
is if you'd have told me before,
like,

1956
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:30,710
you're going to go sell a bunch of shit
and so your plane,

1957
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:31,581
I'm like,
dude,

1958
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:35,280
that is life is going to suck.
Was that a plane?

1959
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:37,281
Just,
you know,

1960
01:18:37,281 --> 01:18:39,440
the house and it was,
this is,

1961
01:18:39,441 --> 01:18:40,700
I'm not trying,
I'm not bragging,

1962
01:18:40,701 --> 01:18:43,610
I'm just telling you what really
happened.

1963
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,260
And,
but I would've thought,

1964
01:18:45,261 --> 01:18:46,094
man,
this life is,

1965
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,150
it's going to be terrible.

1966
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,870
As you take it down and you live a
simpler life and you get your burn rate

1967
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:54,530
down and you get it manageable.
Life's exactly the same.

1968
01:18:55,160 --> 01:19:00,160
Like I don't know.
I mean the happiness factor is exactly

1969
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,990
the same.
None of that shit he's on that they've

1970
01:19:02,991 --> 01:19:05,300
done studies on the none of that shit.
It's more convenient.

1971
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:07,550
Right.
Obviously getting going direct somewhere

1972
01:19:07,551 --> 01:19:10,690
and not dealing with a terminal and,
and you know,

1973
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:13,490
fucking Tsa,
obviously that's different but it takes

1974
01:19:13,491 --> 01:19:14,930
some more time,
you know,

1975
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:19,040
around more people.
But I'm just as happy as I was.

1976
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,410
Heel.
They've done studies on people that

1977
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:24,260
actually complicate their lives with
more success,

1978
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:27,080
more houses,
more things in it actually makes you

1979
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:29,220
more tense.
It gives you more to think about.

1980
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:30,440
Well you got to,
yeah,

1981
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:32,480
I mean you got to keep,
you know,

1982
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:37,100
you have to feed that beast and so you
get a little bit of the dog Jason,

1983
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:40,130
the tail going on and um,
you know,

1984
01:19:40,131 --> 01:19:42,860
life life was moving real,
real fast for me then.

1985
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,540
And it moves a lot slower now.
Um,

1986
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:46,453
which I don't,
I don't,

1987
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:48,530
I don't,
it might be a little slow for my taste

1988
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:49,400
right now,
but I don't,

1989
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:54,500
I didn't like it when it was that fast.
So you cut back on all the expenses and

1990
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:56,600
what do you do?
You do earn money now?

1991
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:58,250
Like what do you do to earn money?
You know,

1992
01:19:58,251 --> 01:19:59,031
occasionally.
So I'll,

1993
01:19:59,031 --> 01:19:59,670
I'll,
I'll,

1994
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:02,390
I still speak and sometimes,
uh,

1995
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:04,710
I'm paid to speak.
Um,

1996
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,980
and then they're just other,
other appearances.

1997
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:09,300
I mean,
I still have some investments that,

1998
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,870
that uh,
you know,

1999
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:14,950
that help sort of ease that pain.
Um,

2000
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:18,120
but you know,
and who knows what the future holds.

2001
01:20:18,121 --> 01:20:20,910
I don't know what,
what if that stuff dries up forever or

2002
01:20:20,911 --> 01:20:22,740
comes back or who knows?

2003
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:26,620
What does it like to sit?
While this was all going on and watching

2004
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:31,570
the economy of this story grow and
develop because it's not,

2005
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,270
it wasn't just the,
the lawsuits.

2006
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,580
There's also,
there's books,

2007
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:40,870
there's documentaries is all these
television shows is all its focus.

2008
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,360
There's ad revenue coming from those
shows,

2009
01:20:43,361 --> 01:20:45,190
is all these people that are dedicating
all this time,

2010
01:20:45,191 --> 01:20:48,820
like their careers become a big part of
their careers,

2011
01:20:48,821 --> 01:20:51,160
become telling the Lance Armstrong
story.

2012
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:51,340
Yeah,

2013
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:51,861
it's a,
it's a,

2014
01:20:51,861 --> 01:20:53,200
it's a,
it's a small industry.

2015
01:20:53,470 --> 01:20:54,440
Yeah.
Um,

2016
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:57,300
I mean there,
there was the industries that benefited

2017
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:59,320
on the way up and I was one of those
industries.

2018
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:00,220
There were the sponsor.
I mean,

2019
01:21:00,221 --> 01:21:03,790
you look at trek bicycles for example.
I mean before the first tour that I

2020
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:07,060
think we did 125 million in sales.
I do a billion now.

2021
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,250
So yeah,
it was big difference.

2022
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:10,750
Um,
Eh,

2023
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,900
so you have those sort of industries,
but then,

2024
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:14,800
you know,
on the way down.

2025
01:21:14,801 --> 01:21:17,770
So those are all people are making money
on the way up and then on the way down,

2026
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,000
uh,
yeah,

2027
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:19,870
it's,
I think it's,

2028
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:22,480
it did happen,
but it's probably normal and natural

2029
01:21:22,481 --> 01:21:24,940
that people capitalize on,
on the way down.

2030
01:21:24,941 --> 01:21:25,840
I mean,
look at Bill Clinton.

2031
01:21:25,841 --> 01:21:27,880
I mean,
as he's going through everything he went

2032
01:21:27,881 --> 01:21:28,271
to,
believe me,

2033
01:21:28,271 --> 01:21:30,370
there were plenty of people going on
right now.

2034
01:21:30,371 --> 01:21:33,490
It's my turn to make some money and fair
play.

2035
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,290
I mean that's just,
that's just the way it is.

2036
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:36,280
And uh,
you know,

2037
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:39,880
some people may think that's bs,
but shit,

2038
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:41,770
I mean,
everybody was hopping on,

2039
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,390
uh,
all the way down.

2040
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:44,670
Well,
they have to write.

2041
01:21:44,671 --> 01:21:45,920
Yeah.
I mean it is a,

2042
01:21:45,921 --> 01:21:48,600
it was a gigantic story.
Now you're,

2043
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:54,170
your friends did know what you were
doing when it came out.

2044
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,130
How many of them had a hard time with
it?

2045
01:21:56,131 --> 01:21:59,250
How many of them were cool with it?
Like what was it like,

2046
01:21:59,251 --> 01:21:59,400
you

2047
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,090
know,
it's,

2048
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:01,260
yeah,
some,

2049
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,000
I mean obviously the people,
you know,

2050
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:05,010
the,
the sponsors fled,

2051
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:06,420
right?
Did any of them stay?

2052
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:08,640
No.
None.

2053
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:11,970
How many did you have at a time?
Maybe 10.

2054
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,340
But they have to leave.
Right?

2055
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,590
I mean,
like some of them are publicly traded

2056
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:18,330
companies,
so they have concerns about that.

2057
01:22:18,331 --> 01:22:19,830
Some of them are just covering their
ass,

2058
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,390
whatever,
but they're all gone.

2059
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,080
Um,
and friends are interesting.

2060
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:26,670
I mean you have,
uh,

2061
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,610
I mean,
just use the [inaudible] foundation is

2062
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,600
as an example,
right?

2063
01:22:30,601 --> 01:22:31,040
I mean,
the,

2064
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,920
the,
I was on the board,

2065
01:22:31,921 --> 01:22:33,540
I was the chairman of the board,
I was the founder.

2066
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,230
The board was my friends.
But these are the friends that say,

2067
01:22:37,231 --> 01:22:37,980
okay,
you're out.

2068
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:41,070
And so I get it that,
that there might be a strategic reason

2069
01:22:41,071 --> 01:22:43,840
for that,
but then when you never hear from them,

2070
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:46,080
then all of a sudden these people
disappear from your life.

2071
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,700
I mean,
the way I sum it up is,

2072
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:49,860
is anytime anybody goes through
anything,

2073
01:22:49,861 --> 01:22:51,690
and I don't know if you've had some
heavy shit in your life,

2074
01:22:51,691 --> 01:22:55,890
but when you're going through it,
people either lean in or they lean out

2075
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,330
and some people lean out,
which means they run away.

2076
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:02,490
And you're surprised by that and you're
like,

2077
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,630
what the fuck?
I mean,

2078
01:23:03,631 --> 01:23:06,130
that guy was at every champagne party we
threw in Paris.

2079
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:09,580
And right now he's like,
I've heard from the dude in three years.

2080
01:23:09,850 --> 01:23:10,810
Like,
that's strange.

2081
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:12,070
Right?
Um,

2082
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:16,250
but he probably has his own motivate,
either covering his own ass or maybe he

2083
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,730
one of these people that has a
tremendous sense of betrayal and it's

2084
01:23:18,731 --> 01:23:21,250
just so pissed still and hurt.
And we have to,

2085
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:23,110
I mean,
I have to be receptive to that.

2086
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:25,420
Um,
but then they're the ones who lean in,

2087
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:25,780
right?

2088
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:28,030
And,
and most of those people don't surprise

2089
01:23:28,031 --> 01:23:29,320
you,
but then there are others that lean in

2090
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:30,310
and they surprise.
You're like,

2091
01:23:30,311 --> 01:23:32,200
wow,
I didn't,

2092
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:36,070
I didn't know you had my back like that.
And so you get surprised on both sides

2093
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,570
and,
and at the end of it all,

2094
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:39,610
dude,
you look around and you're like,

2095
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:40,840
all right,
this,

2096
01:23:40,841 --> 01:23:42,520
this,
if these people are here to these,

2097
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:44,920
these are the people that are going to
ride anything out with me,

2098
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:48,550
which is Kinda cool and refreshing for
me to,

2099
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,110
to,
to really know,

2100
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:51,071
right?
If you're,

2101
01:23:51,071 --> 01:23:52,720
if you're,
if you're in the,

2102
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,260
if you're loading up a bus with all your
most loyal,

2103
01:23:56,350 --> 01:24:00,250
closest friends,
I fucking know who's on that bus now at

2104
01:24:00,251 --> 01:24:02,560
this point.
And for 20 years,

2105
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:05,800
you know,
there was just a bunch of chumps that,

2106
01:24:05,801 --> 01:24:06,634
that,
that,

2107
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:10,120
that were on that bus.
But you know,

2108
01:24:10,121 --> 01:24:11,370
as soon as,
as soon as the,

2109
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:13,030
the,
somebody changed the music,

2110
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,530
they hopped off.
And so,

2111
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:16,320
um,

2112
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:21,090
and would tell you it takes adversity to
eliminate that no other way in until you

2113
01:24:21,091 --> 01:24:22,440
test them.
You really don't know.

2114
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:23,610
Yeah.
Adversity.

2115
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:26,290
I remember,
this is the funny quote,

2116
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:28,290
we were,
this is a postal thing,

2117
01:24:28,291 --> 01:24:29,480
but we were,
once I was at,

2118
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:32,040
I don't remember the postmaster
general's name,

2119
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:33,470
his name at the time,
but we,

2120
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:34,230
we did,
uh,

2121
01:24:34,230 --> 01:24:36,630
this totally unrelated,
but you said it versus saw it reminded

2122
01:24:36,631 --> 01:24:40,350
me he was introducing me at this thing
and he wanted to site,

2123
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:41,790
you know,
introducing me.

2124
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,700
He's overcome great adversity.
He says is lance,

2125
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:47,850
he's,
he's overcome great diversity.

2126
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,270
And I'm thinking,
Jesus White Kid from Plano,

2127
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:59,500
I didn't overcome shit.
Whoops.

2128
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,590
Um,
raising kids.

2129
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:04,483
Yup.
Uh,

2130
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:08,900
we both have children.
And obviously when you were raising your

2131
01:25:08,901 --> 01:25:10,670
kid,
you're teaching them about life,

2132
01:25:10,671 --> 01:25:12,620
you're trying to set an example.
Yep.

2133
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:16,340
Um,
did you have to sit them down and

2134
01:25:16,341 --> 01:25:18,230
explain what was going on?

2135
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,400
Um,
how old were your youngest at the time?

2136
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:23,750
Oh,
and t,

2137
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:26,480
uh,
the youngest we're wanting to,

2138
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:27,710
whoa.
Yeah.

2139
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,180
You didn't have to explain it.
So I've got,

2140
01:25:29,181 --> 01:25:32,600
I have three kids with my ex wife,
Kristen and Lucas,

2141
01:25:32,601 --> 01:25:36,800
now 16 and twin girls that are 14.
And then I have a six and a five year

2142
01:25:36,801 --> 01:25:39,230
old with Ana.
I'm bitten,

2143
01:25:39,231 --> 01:25:40,760
by the way.
All you know,

2144
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:43,850
it's the craziest blended family you've
ever seen.

2145
01:25:43,851 --> 01:25:46,770
Like those five kids are five siblings.
It's,

2146
01:25:46,771 --> 01:25:49,760
it's the most beautiful thing.
And Anna and kristen are like sisters.

2147
01:25:49,761 --> 01:25:50,594
I mean,
it's,

2148
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:52,580
I got a great situation.
That's awesome.

2149
01:25:52,610 --> 01:25:53,660
Awesome,
awesome.

2150
01:25:53,661 --> 01:25:55,300
It takes a lot of work,
but um,

2151
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,900
or took a lot of work to get to this
place,

2152
01:25:56,901 --> 01:25:58,670
but it's awesome.
And Kristen,

2153
01:25:58,671 --> 01:26:03,671
to her credit was who I was married to
during this ugly period.

2154
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,713
Um,
and who,

2155
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:08,270
you know,
would obviously would have known

2156
01:26:08,271 --> 01:26:09,600
everything,
um,

2157
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:10,913
has been great.

2158
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:13,430
Whether it's,
whether it's conversations she's had

2159
01:26:13,431 --> 01:26:15,740
with our older children while were at
her house,

2160
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:20,690
or just just helping massage this thing.
But I'm still sitting down with my kids.

2161
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:21,710
I mean our whole,
you know,

2162
01:26:21,711 --> 01:26:23,350
I go to therapy and it goes,
we all go to them,

2163
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,990
the kids go a week.
So we still sit down and just kind of

2164
01:26:26,991 --> 01:26:28,010
work this out.
Dude,

2165
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:29,300
this is,
is is not,

2166
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:32,010
this is a complicated thing.
And,

2167
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,850
and,
and the crazy thing is my older kids

2168
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:37,940
have kind of gotten through it.
The six and the five year old will come

2169
01:26:37,941 --> 01:26:39,170
into it,
right?

2170
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:42,170
I mean the Internet and,
and you know,

2171
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,670
fucking Google,
wikipedia,

2172
01:26:43,671 --> 01:26:45,080
you name it,
they're going to,

2173
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:47,270
they will,
they will grow into this like at some

2174
01:26:47,271 --> 01:26:49,190
point,
my six year old boy who said just a

2175
01:26:49,191 --> 01:26:52,190
fanatical athlete and everything is
sports and sports and sports.

2176
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:54,770
I mean,
I mean I hear his,

2177
01:26:54,771 --> 01:26:57,350
him and his friends talk about Tom Brady
and one of his friends like,

2178
01:26:57,351 --> 01:26:58,170
oh,
he's a cheater.

2179
01:26:58,170 --> 01:26:59,720
My son loves Tom Brady.
He's like,

2180
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:00,321
oh,
he's a cheater.

2181
01:27:00,321 --> 01:27:03,800
I'm like,
it ain't going to be long before Max

2182
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,530
Armstrong is at school.
And some kid in another class goes,

2183
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:09,770
isn't your dad that cheater?
Like he's going to be like,

2184
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,750
what?
Like he,

2185
01:27:11,751 --> 01:27:12,830
he doesn't know that,
but he,

2186
01:27:12,831 --> 01:27:16,160
so he's going to grow into that.
So that conversation will then be had at

2187
01:27:16,161 --> 01:27:18,020
that time.
It's tough to have it with a six year

2188
01:27:18,021 --> 01:27:19,370
old today,
but,

2189
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:22,310
so I know that's coming.
Right.

2190
01:27:22,311 --> 01:27:23,870
And so,
but I have the experience of having

2191
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:27,500
dealt with it with a 16 year old boy who
at the time was 13.

2192
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:28,970
Um,
and,

2193
01:27:28,971 --> 01:27:31,100
and still dealing with it with those
guys.

2194
01:27:31,101 --> 01:27:32,960
And you know,
so far,

2195
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:35,780
I mean,
I think we've been super proactive,

2196
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:36,840
probably,
you know,

2197
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:39,230
Anna and Kristen probably think I
should've been more proactive.

2198
01:27:39,230 --> 01:27:40,730
But,
um,

2199
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:43,580
I think it's an,
I think that's in a good spot.

2200
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:47,390
So you have group therapy sessions where
you just discuss.

2201
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:50,060
So I've sat with,
with all three kids,

2202
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:51,440
the older kids,
you know,

2203
01:27:51,441 --> 01:27:53,890
and it's just sort of free for all.
Wow.

2204
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:57,830
Yeah.
And they had no idea until the scandal

2205
01:27:57,831 --> 01:27:58,664
broke.
Yep.

2206
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:02,720
And what was their reaction?
Um,

2207
01:28:03,290 --> 01:28:04,100
you know,
the girls were,

2208
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:05,960
they were nine,
so they were still,

2209
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:07,370
they were young.
I mean,

2210
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:10,040
a nine year old girl,
they really didn't have a reaction.

2211
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:11,030
Luke was,
was,

2212
01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:12,080
uh,
was,

2213
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:14,420
uh,
a 13 year old boy.

2214
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,290
No.
So they were 11,

2215
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,330
so luke was 13.
They were 11.

2216
01:28:17,331 --> 01:28:19,520
They still sort of immune to it,
you know,

2217
01:28:19,521 --> 01:28:20,930
he,
he was,

2218
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:25,310
I mean he watched when he watched oprah
because it airdrie or four days later I

2219
01:28:25,311 --> 01:28:28,820
had sort of fled to Hawaii.
I mean,

2220
01:28:28,821 --> 01:28:30,460
he called me up cause I talked about
luke on,

2221
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,180
on,
on her show,

2222
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:35,960
um,
with the whole idea that I know he's

2223
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,190
defending me at school.

2224
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:39,590
I mean,
there was enough smoke that people were

2225
01:28:39,591 --> 01:28:40,071
going,
Dude,

2226
01:28:40,071 --> 01:28:41,440
you're dad's a doper,
et cetera.

2227
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:45,380
And he was defending me and my point,
Oprah was that at this point I get to

2228
01:28:45,381 --> 01:28:46,790
say to Luke,
stop defending me.

2229
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,800
You don't need to defend me anymore.
Right.

2230
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,920
It's true.
And so he watched that,

2231
01:28:51,921 --> 01:28:54,290
which is probably a heavy moment for,
for him.

2232
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:55,970
It would have been awful watching it
with him.

2233
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:59,060
Um,
but he called me and said,

2234
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:01,110
I understand and,
and I love you.

2235
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:03,120
And,
and uh,

2236
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:04,441
but we still,
I mean,

2237
01:29:04,441 --> 01:29:06,990
that was three years ago.
We still have to talk about these

2238
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:07,501
things,
man.

2239
01:29:07,501 --> 01:29:08,334
It it

2240
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:10,250
how often?
Not,

2241
01:29:10,251 --> 01:29:11,160
not often.
No.

2242
01:29:11,161 --> 01:29:15,470
It's still occasionally comes up,
especially if you're talking about the

2243
01:29:15,471 --> 01:29:18,060
importance of being honest and truthful
and,

2244
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:20,330
and having character.
Yeah.

2245
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:22,030
And he's an athlete.
I mean,

2246
01:29:22,031 --> 01:29:22,451
look,
I mean,

2247
01:29:22,451 --> 01:29:25,120
not that,
that's the only thing that I will,

2248
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,350
and I will say,
I mean,

2249
01:29:26,351 --> 01:29:29,860
I don't want a ideal,
my son's huge,

2250
01:29:29,861 --> 01:29:30,790
six,
six,

2251
01:29:30,791 --> 01:29:33,230
three,
230 pounds plays offensive line.

2252
01:29:33,231 --> 01:29:34,020
Like,

2253
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:34,870
well,
that's good.

2254
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:36,760
That is not too many people would be
fucking with him.

2255
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:38,520
Yeah.
He's,

2256
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,460
he,
I think he's good there,

2257
01:29:39,461 --> 01:29:40,294
but he's also a real

2258
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,750
sweet guy.
Like he's not,

2259
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:43,700
he's not a,
he's not an anybody's face.

2260
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:48,080
Um,
but I don't want him to say his football

2261
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:49,470
passion or,

2262
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:50,460
or career,
what call it,

2263
01:29:50,461 --> 01:29:52,290
what you will ends up,
you know,

2264
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:54,120
at a high level.
I mean,

2265
01:29:54,121 --> 01:29:56,790
I don't want him in a messy spot where
he's got to make tough choices.

2266
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:57,571
Right.
In fact,

2267
01:29:57,571 --> 01:30:01,020
I don't want that at all.
And football is a sport where you have

2268
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:03,570
to make tough choices.
I mean,

2269
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,280
I'm not a football player,
but I can,

2270
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:07,830
yeah.
I can imagine.

2271
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:09,420
I have friends that are,
yeah.

2272
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,680
I can imagine.
Yeah.

2273
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:14,490
That's mean.
And it's also open and it's also brought

2274
01:30:14,491 --> 01:30:17,130
up by coaches and it's also brought up
by trainers.

2275
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:18,780
I mean,
it's just a,

2276
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:22,260
it's a part of the game as much as I'm
sure it is in cycling.

2277
01:30:22,261 --> 01:30:24,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

2278
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:30,190
That had to be just,
it's just how to like be chewing you

2279
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:33,730
apart when you know that your kids
defending you and you know it's going to

2280
01:30:33,731 --> 01:30:34,690
come out.
And you know,

2281
01:30:34,691 --> 01:30:37,630
he's having these conversations at
school and he's like,

2282
01:30:37,631 --> 01:30:39,250
my dad's not a cheater.
Yup.

2283
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:43,390
Well,
we didn't know it was going to come out.

2284
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:44,350
I mean,
even,

2285
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:47,530
even when the Wicki was investigating,
I mean that,

2286
01:30:47,531 --> 01:30:49,240
that,
that case went away.

2287
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,010
Right.
So we thought at that point,

2288
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,410
maybe we're done and,
and,

2289
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:54,791
and,
and,

2290
01:30:54,791 --> 01:30:55,541
and it didn't,
I mean,

2291
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:57,170
you sought a picked up,
uh,

2292
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:59,040
the investigation and then,
uh,

2293
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,280
uh,
you know,

2294
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:04,090
based on all his work,
they picked it up and then it came up.

2295
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:08,050
But I can,
it happened fast,

2296
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:11,840
like get,
it was seemingly like instantaneous man.

2297
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:13,160
It be an enterprise.
You,

2298
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:17,490
um,
yeah,

2299
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:18,201
yeah.
I think,

2300
01:31:18,201 --> 01:31:18,920
I mean,
I guess it's,

2301
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,990
yeah,
it surprised me,

2302
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:21,853
but

2303
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,190
shit,
anybody would have been surprised I

2304
01:31:24,191 --> 01:31:26,170
suppose.
And it was just surreal,

2305
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:27,460
you know,
the way,

2306
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:28,470
uh,
it,

2307
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:32,090
it all came out and uh,
and,

2308
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:37,110
and in the method at which they sort of
advertised the findings,

2309
01:31:38,561 --> 01:31:39,161
you know,
it was,

2310
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:41,100
it was,
and there was a whole strip,

2311
01:31:41,101 --> 01:31:42,250
but to their credit,
I mean,

2312
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,500
there was a strategy on their end.
So let's,

2313
01:31:44,501 --> 01:31:47,620
let's take Novitsky keys work,
let's do some additional investigations,

2314
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:51,820
let's package it and what's something
they called the reason decision and then

2315
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:55,580
let's go out and talk about it all over
the place like that,

2316
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:57,550
that,
that was kind of unbelievable to me.

2317
01:31:58,070 --> 01:32:02,470
Why do you think they spent so much time
and resources going after you,

2318
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:05,400
uh,
as opposed to all the other people who

2319
01:32:05,401 --> 01:32:06,234
have one b?

2320
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,580
Well,
because they needed a landmark case that

2321
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:13,110
I think there's plenty of people that,
that

2322
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,690
I'm just guessing I'm not,
this is not based on any proof.

2323
01:32:18,691 --> 01:32:20,480
And,
and I've had conversations with,

2324
01:32:20,481 --> 01:32:20,991
you saw it.
I mean,

2325
01:32:20,991 --> 01:32:25,991
I think we're still getting to the point
where we can do stuff together or have a

2326
01:32:26,001 --> 01:32:28,670
conversation.
So I'm not trying to criticize them.

2327
01:32:28,671 --> 01:32:29,504
I mean,
I think there,

2328
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:30,980
there,
there ought to be a place for them,

2329
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:35,240
but I think there's also realistic.
I mean in reality there are,

2330
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:36,980
there are people that think they're
ineffective.

2331
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,500
They think they spend 10 or 20 or 50
minute,

2332
01:32:39,501 --> 01:32:41,600
whatever the number is,
millions of dollars a year.

2333
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:44,570
And they don't catch anybody.
Right?

2334
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:46,970
I mean if you look at the amount of
positives is,

2335
01:32:46,971 --> 01:32:50,360
must be less than 1%.
Well,

2336
01:32:50,361 --> 01:32:51,690
if I told you,
well Joe,

2337
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:54,200
we're all good man is less than 1%
testing positive,

2338
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:56,030
he would,
you would right.

2339
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,880
You think that right?
Yeah.

2340
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:00,980
So they needed,
they needed a landmark case to say,

2341
01:33:01,190 --> 01:33:02,510
no,
we are effective.

2342
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:05,510
And here it is.
Um,

2343
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:08,870
and I think also from a legal
perspective at set some legal precedents

2344
01:33:08,871 --> 01:33:13,640
for them that they can use going forward
in other cases with future future cases.

2345
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:16,663
But,
uh,

2346
01:33:17,210 --> 01:33:20,540
and then you add in a,
just a ginormous story that was

2347
01:33:20,541 --> 01:33:25,541
guaranteed to get a lot of press.
But it still pains me to,

2348
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:26,930
to,
to look,

2349
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:28,970
I know what went on.
We all know what went on,

2350
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,450
but I can't take,
uh,

2351
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:34,820
when,
when I hear that,

2352
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:38,630
that this program or this particular
athlete being me was the greatest fraud

2353
01:33:38,631 --> 01:33:41,050
in the history of sport.
You know,

2354
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,370
I can't,
that's just not true.

2355
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:45,350
Right.
And then when you hear that,

2356
01:33:45,351 --> 01:33:46,510
are the,
the,

2357
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:50,480
our teams doping program was the most
sophisticated program in the history of

2358
01:33:50,481 --> 01:33:51,550
sport.
Well,

2359
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:53,540
we also know that's not true.
Right?

2360
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:57,110
Um,
so those are,

2361
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,240
and then,
and then the final one was,

2362
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:02,380
which is really,
I think bothered a lot of people that,

2363
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:07,370
that this person being me forced young,
impressionable young men to put

2364
01:34:07,371 --> 01:34:09,500
dangerous substances into their body.
Right?

2365
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,620
That just is not true.
And,

2366
01:34:12,621 --> 01:34:14,210
uh,
but if I heard somebody,

2367
01:34:14,211 --> 01:34:17,300
if somebody said that about one of my
son's friends,

2368
01:34:17,301 --> 01:34:19,130
I would be pissed off too.
Like I'd be like,

2369
01:34:19,190 --> 01:34:20,630
dude,
screw that guy.

2370
01:34:21,450 --> 01:34:24,950
Right?
But we all made our own choices.

2371
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:27,530
We were all grown men.
They were bad choices,

2372
01:34:27,531 --> 01:34:29,300
right?
So most would say we would say,

2373
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:30,710
um,
but,

2374
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:33,920
but there was no forcing to do that.

2375
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,700
What is it like now?
Like in a,

2376
01:34:37,701 --> 01:34:40,010
I mean I want you to personal,
but your personal life,

2377
01:34:40,011 --> 01:34:43,820
like people value honesty.
It's one of the most important things in

2378
01:34:43,821 --> 01:34:48,821
friends and lovers when you have this
thing where you're on video over and

2379
01:34:52,371 --> 01:34:54,680
over and over and over and over and over
again,

2380
01:34:54,681 --> 01:34:58,190
being deceptive over and over again,
defending when you,

2381
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,290
it's,
and then you come out and say it's all a

2382
01:35:00,291 --> 01:35:03,140
lot.
And so there's this like database of

2383
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:05,750
lying,
like what is it like,

2384
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:08,360
like trying to get people to trust you,

2385
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,910
right?
Hey man,

2386
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:14,350
that's [inaudible] this is what,
this is what I talked about in the

2387
01:35:14,351 --> 01:35:16,200
beginning is that that that road is,
uh,

2388
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:17,650
is,
is net that will be,

2389
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:22,300
that is a never ending path.
I will be walking that walk the rest of

2390
01:35:22,301 --> 01:35:25,840
my life and there were a lot of people
that'll say,

2391
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:28,570
[inaudible],
I'm never trusting this guy ever again.

2392
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:32,620
I don't care.
I don't care how apologetic or tried he

2393
01:35:32,621 --> 01:35:33,454
is,
I'm done.

2394
01:35:34,030 --> 01:35:35,470
Um,
but that's,

2395
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:38,710
that's the,
the key is that I have to be committed

2396
01:35:38,711 --> 01:35:39,700
to that path.
Right.

2397
01:35:39,701 --> 01:35:42,670
And so I can walk that walk and,
uh,

2398
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:45,680
and,
and take each case individually and one

2399
01:35:45,681 --> 01:35:47,140
on one.
Um,

2400
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:49,800
but
talk about in drumming,

2401
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:52,300
we've talked about endurance that will
be the longest,

2402
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:55,690
the longest walk or the longest journey
of my life.

2403
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,970
Do you have a code that you follow now?
I mean,

2404
01:35:59,971 --> 01:36:01,610
have you imposed like,
uh,

2405
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:06,000
a stringent set of rules on yourself
where like,

2406
01:36:06,001 --> 01:36:06,481
you know,
like,

2407
01:36:06,481 --> 01:36:11,040
because of this history,
you can't lie about anything ever?

2408
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:12,960
No,
I mean,

2409
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:14,723
I haven't thought,
I mean,

2410
01:36:14,890 --> 01:36:16,380
I guess the answer's no because I
haven't,

2411
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,150
there's not been a,
you know,

2412
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,910
sort of a new mission statement or sort
of these key,

2413
01:36:20,911 --> 01:36:25,230
but,
but I mean

2414
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:30,240
life was pretty transparent anyways
before that.

2415
01:36:30,330 --> 01:36:33,060
But I mean,
there was obviously there was the huge

2416
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,180
deception.
Um,

2417
01:36:36,181 --> 01:36:37,940
but it's not as if,
you know,

2418
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:41,160
anything crazy out there outside of
that.

2419
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:41,950
Yeah.

2420
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:42,880
But I mean,
you know,

2421
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:44,200
um,
it's just,

2422
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:49,460
that's a big thing with people to be
able to trust our friends or you'll be

2423
01:36:49,461 --> 01:36:51,250
able to trust their boyfriend or
girlfriend,

2424
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,113
you know?
Yup.

2425
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:56,800
For sure.
What is life like for Lance Armstrong

2426
01:36:56,801 --> 01:36:57,640
now?
Like is a,

2427
01:36:57,641 --> 01:37:01,600
is everything calmed down to the point
where the stress has minimized except

2428
01:37:01,601 --> 01:37:02,434
for the lawsuit?

2429
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:04,170
Uh,
yeah,

2430
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:04,891
it's,
it's,

2431
01:37:04,891 --> 01:37:07,380
as I said a sec a second ago,
it's just simple,

2432
01:37:07,381 --> 01:37:07,761
man.
I,

2433
01:37:07,761 --> 01:37:08,400
I mean,
I,

2434
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:09,840
I still,
I love to workout,

2435
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,600
so I train every day.
I think that's what he'd do.

2436
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:14,370
I,
uh,

2437
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:18,750
I primarily run and then I'll do a
little bit of gym work and then,

2438
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,310
uh,
I'll ride occasionally,

2439
01:37:20,311 --> 01:37:22,620
although very rarely,
very rarely get on a bike.

2440
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:24,570
Um,
and

2441
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:29,490
I just,
it takes too much time and it's just,

2442
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:31,830
I take so much time.
I mean,

2443
01:37:31,831 --> 01:37:33,150
you could run for an hour.
Oh,

2444
01:37:33,151 --> 01:37:34,740
I said,
if you do a hard run for an hour,

2445
01:37:34,741 --> 01:37:37,740
you got to go ride for three hours.
So that's two more hours that you,

2446
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,950
unless you got to get all this shit on
and go out and deal with traffic.

2447
01:37:40,951 --> 01:37:44,310
And it does it psychologically fuck with
you when you get on a bike.

2448
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:45,240
It's,
it's,

2449
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:49,800
I mean,
I have some bitterness there towards

2450
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:53,460
what we've talked about primarily in and
around the economy of it,

2451
01:37:53,461 --> 01:37:54,294
how it was.

2452
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:55,500
And now everybody's,
no,

2453
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:56,310
no,
nope.

2454
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:58,290
We're out or we don't want,
right.

2455
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,191
We're going to,
you know,

2456
01:37:59,191 --> 01:38:00,450
so that's,
that's,

2457
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:01,920
but that's,
that's on me.

2458
01:38:01,921 --> 01:38:03,420
I got to work that out.
And that's not,

2459
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,400
that's not their fault.
That's my fault.

2460
01:38:05,401 --> 01:38:08,400
So there's some of that and it's nice to
do.

2461
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:09,930
I love to run on me.
I grew up,

2462
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:11,340
I ran before I wrote,
so it's,

2463
01:38:11,341 --> 01:38:13,830
it's nice to go into something where I
can still get,

2464
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:15,090
I mean,
I view working out,

2465
01:38:15,091 --> 01:38:17,010
you probably view it the same way.
It's almost like a therapy.

2466
01:38:17,011 --> 01:38:18,480
Like you're in there,
you're suffering,

2467
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,390
you're just working shit out.
Right.

2468
01:38:20,391 --> 01:38:22,440
And that's what,
that's what I do when I,

2469
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,830
um,
when I work out or go for a long run.

2470
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:28,130
So I do that,
uh,

2471
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:29,160
a joke.
I mean we have,

2472
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:30,810
you know,
I have five kids are in four different

2473
01:38:30,811 --> 01:38:31,850
schools,
so it's um,

2474
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:36,300
like an uber driver for my kids.
But traffic in Austin is not like la,

2475
01:38:36,301 --> 01:38:37,320
but it's bad.
Now.

2476
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:40,800
This again bad now and so all I do is
drive my kids around.

2477
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:42,960
Too many people talk about how Great
Austin is.

2478
01:38:42,961 --> 01:38:43,630
That's what happened.

2479
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:44,690
Right?
Well the,

2480
01:38:44,691 --> 01:38:48,940
but they didn't build that city 50 years
ago to accommodate 2 million people.

2481
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,070
And then,
uh,

2482
01:38:51,071 --> 01:38:52,330
I played a lot.
I play a lot of golf,

2483
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:54,650
which is why we're going to end this
podcast will,

2484
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:56,690
that's why I can go play Riviera.
They man,

2485
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:58,150
don't mess up my tee time.

2486
01:38:58,260 --> 01:38:59,820
I don't,
I don't want to mess with you tea time.

2487
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:01,240
I appreciate your time very much.

2488
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:03,880
But we've already done,
we can keep going.

2489
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:07,030
Keep going.
I Dunno if Higgs is here yet.

2490
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,320
He's,
I'm sure he's here.

2491
01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:10,690
Someone's calling me.
That's on him.

2492
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,750
Um,
and then you got the hunter book.

2493
01:39:13,751 --> 01:39:14,920
We got to talk a little bit about
hunter.

2494
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:15,790
Yeah,
definitely.

2495
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:18,130
I didn't know you were a fan until I saw
your,

2496
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:22,570
maybe bill burr retweeted.
Maybe you're a tweet that said,

2497
01:39:23,350 --> 01:39:25,300
if anybody,
if there's one person that's dead that,

2498
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:26,310
that,
you know,

2499
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:28,900
that I could meet today or was alive
would be hunter.

2500
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,040
Yeah.
It was a instagram post that I made

2501
01:39:31,041 --> 01:39:33,710
about one of his incredible quotes
about,

2502
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:36,920
um,
it was about heroes and it was,

2503
01:39:36,921 --> 01:39:40,240
uh,
it was particularly poignant about a,

2504
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:42,140
it was after Ronda Rousey got knocked
out,

2505
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:44,910
but I posted it that people,
they,

2506
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:49,920
they love the idea of someone who is
like a superhuman person,

2507
01:39:51,681 --> 01:39:53,300
like someone who's a legend,
someone who,

2508
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:58,180
who can defy the odds because it gives
them hope in this crazy world,

2509
01:39:58,490 --> 01:40:02,300
boredom and cubicles.
And I'm doing a shitty job of

2510
01:40:02,301 --> 01:40:04,400
paraphrasing it,
but it's a fantastic quote.

2511
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:06,530
And then you got a hold of me about it.
And,

2512
01:40:06,531 --> 01:40:09,170
uh,
had that incredible book sent to me.

2513
01:40:09,171 --> 01:40:11,840
What an a hunter was running for sheriff
of Aspen.

2514
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:12,440
Yup.
Yup.

2515
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:13,550
Yup.
So he,

2516
01:40:13,551 --> 01:40:14,060
yeah,
he,

2517
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:15,240
he just,
you know,

2518
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:17,240
he kind of ruled the valley.
I mean,

2519
01:40:17,241 --> 01:40:18,590
he lived down in Woody Creek,
but,

2520
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,900
but the whole,
um,

2521
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,800
the whole valley was the roaring fork
valley was kind of his domain and he was

2522
01:40:24,801 --> 01:40:27,260
just in,
his best friend was,

2523
01:40:27,290 --> 01:40:29,840
was our longtime sheriff.
He was the sheriff for 26 years.

2524
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:32,330
Bob Brown,
who's a great friend of mine,

2525
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:35,390
uh,
his under sheriff is probably my best

2526
01:40:35,391 --> 01:40:37,430
bud there,
a guy named by the name of Joe de Salvo.

2527
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:41,480
So how a kid from Brooklyn ends up in
Aspen is now the sheriff is on a second

2528
01:40:41,481 --> 01:40:43,470
term.
So Joey and Bob were,

2529
01:40:43,471 --> 01:40:45,990
were hunters best buddies.
I mean,

2530
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:48,740
fucking crazy stories and I,
and,

2531
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:52,330
and not to toot my own horn,
but in bob has,

2532
01:40:52,331 --> 01:40:53,740
is the sweetest.
He was,

2533
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,510
he's the guy that was shared for 26
years.

2534
01:40:55,511 --> 01:40:56,620
He says to me one day,
he says,

2535
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:00,220
he calls me champ,
which is also funny.

2536
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:01,750
He says,
Jampie says,

2537
01:41:01,751 --> 01:41:03,040
uh,
did you ever meet hunter?

2538
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:04,061
And I said,
no,

2539
01:41:04,061 --> 01:41:06,970
I never met him.
And he pauses for a long time.

2540
01:41:06,971 --> 01:41:07,870
And he goes,
man,

2541
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:11,120
he would have loved you.
I was,

2542
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,033
I took that.
I was like,

2543
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:12,611
fucking,
hey,

2544
01:41:12,611 --> 01:41:15,610
that was a compliment right there.
Hunter was,

2545
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,380
was,
was nuts and,

2546
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:19,090
and a lot of ways,
but I know,

2547
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:21,160
I mean,
he had such a diverse group of friends,

2548
01:41:21,161 --> 01:41:23,230
whether it's,
whether it was our sheriff or whether it

2549
01:41:23,231 --> 01:41:26,520
was lyle lovett or whether it was Johnny
Depp or whether it was Doug Brinkley.

2550
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:27,340
I mean,
just,

2551
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:31,870
just this diverse group of fucking
artists and thinkers and lawmen and,

2552
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,160
and druggies and dude,
gnarly.

2553
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:39,160
I mean,
he'd go out to the shit they did was

2554
01:41:39,161 --> 01:41:41,290
just,
I probably can't even talk about it.

2555
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:42,550
I'm sure you can.
He's dead.

2556
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:44,410
It's fine.
There were some of the people are still

2557
01:41:44,411 --> 01:41:46,570
alive,
still alive when we were talking before

2558
01:41:46,571 --> 01:41:48,430
the podcast about his ritual,
uh,

2559
01:41:48,670 --> 01:41:49,600
before you would,
right.

2560
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:50,810
So like,
yeah,

2561
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:52,890
superhuman.
So I you,

2562
01:41:52,891 --> 01:41:55,870
so you read that and if for those
listening or you just google,

2563
01:41:55,871 --> 01:41:58,070
you know,
a hunter Thompson's daily regime and

2564
01:41:58,071 --> 01:41:58,901
you'll,
it'll come up,

2565
01:41:58,901 --> 01:42:01,840
I think esquire wrote it and the shit
starts at like,

2566
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:03,700
what is,
he wakes up at like three in the

2567
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:04,534
afternoon,
right?

2568
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:06,100
And it just,
you got to go read it.

2569
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:07,660
I mean it's,
it's unbelievable.

2570
01:42:07,661 --> 01:42:09,400
So I thought,
this is so unreal.

2571
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:12,610
It ain't true.
So I called Joey,

2572
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,780
our sheriff and I said,
dude,

2573
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:15,640
I have you seen this?
And he says,

2574
01:42:15,641 --> 01:42:16,620
yeah,
I said that,

2575
01:42:16,621 --> 01:42:18,550
that's not real.
You know what he said?

2576
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:21,010
He said,
that isn't enough.

2577
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:23,170
He said,
that's light.

2578
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:27,910
Can you believe,
go read it people and then imagine that,

2579
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:28,833
that,
that,

2580
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:30,520
that didn't quite get there.
Well Jamie,

2581
01:42:30,521 --> 01:42:31,670
why don't you find it?
Cause it's,

2582
01:42:31,671 --> 01:42:34,000
it's kind of hilarious.
We could actually read it on the air

2583
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:34,873
dude.

2584
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:35,831
Yeah.
He,

2585
01:42:35,831 --> 01:42:39,250
um,
he had a strong tolerance for substances

2586
01:42:39,251 --> 01:42:42,280
and he,
I don't think he ever went without,

2587
01:42:42,770 --> 01:42:44,540
I mean it's just he wasn't interested.
No,

2588
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:46,150
no.
Yeah.

2589
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:49,060
I mean that was,
that was the life that he was interested

2590
01:42:49,061 --> 01:42:50,800
in.
He was interested in just getting fucked

2591
01:42:50,801 --> 01:42:55,660
up and having a great time and,
and writing about shit and pontificating

2592
01:42:55,661 --> 01:42:57,310
on the demise of civilization.
Yeah.

2593
01:42:57,970 --> 01:42:59,170
But it,
but you know,

2594
01:42:59,290 --> 01:43:01,120
I don't know if that's what caught up to
him,

2595
01:43:01,121 --> 01:43:03,400
but it definitely did.
I mean,

2596
01:43:03,401 --> 01:43:06,460
how could you,
did you ever see the late appearances?

2597
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:08,380
I,
I have a really hard time watching his

2598
01:43:08,381 --> 01:43:10,930
later appearances.
Like we would do like the Conan O'brien

2599
01:43:10,931 --> 01:43:13,270
show and you could understand a word he
was saying.

2600
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:15,100
Like here,
you can see it right here.

2601
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:20,370
3:00 PM rise through.

01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:03,540
8:00 AM Halsey on is that,
I say it a sleeping pills.

2635
01:45:03,541 --> 01:45:04,620
The first.
That was before I.

2636
01:45:04,621 --> 01:45:05,454
Ambien.
Yeah.

2637
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:07,370
Eight 20 sleep.
Wow.

2638
01:45:07,490 --> 01:45:09,500
Jesus Christ.
So I asked the guys,

2639
01:45:09,501 --> 01:45:10,370
I asked the sheriff's,
I'm like,

2640
01:45:10,371 --> 01:45:11,840
that kid shit's not real.
Yeah.

2641
01:45:11,841 --> 01:45:12,561
There's the,
uh,

2642
01:45:12,561 --> 01:45:15,800
the quote that I po myths and legends
die hard in America.

2643
01:45:15,801 --> 01:45:18,830
We Love them for the extra dimension.
They provide the illusion of near

2644
01:45:18,831 --> 01:45:22,850
infinite possibility to erase the narrow
confines of most men's reality.

2645
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:28,150
Weird heroes and mold breaking champions
exist as proof to those who needed that.

2646
01:45:28,461 --> 01:45:31,430
The tyranny of the rat race is not yet
final.

2647
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:32,481
Yeah.
I mean,

2648
01:45:32,481 --> 01:45:33,920
this isn't like that.
I mean,

2649
01:45:33,921 --> 01:45:37,970
that applies to you to do that.
I understand that it applies to your

2650
01:45:37,971 --> 01:45:38,930
life.
Yeah.

2651
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,960
I mean,
and that's part of the reason I'm sure

2652
01:45:41,961 --> 01:45:44,780
why some people were pissed at you.
It's like you were a legend with a

2653
01:45:44,781 --> 01:45:45,450
caveat.

2654
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:46,950
Yup.
Yeah.

2655
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,460
I mean the,
the,

2656
01:45:48,461 --> 01:45:51,720
the,
the story in its totality,

2657
01:45:51,721 --> 01:45:53,520
right?
If I was just a cyclist,

2658
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:55,860
we wouldn't be having this conversation.
But,

2659
01:45:56,490 --> 01:45:59,250
but the cancer part of the story,
right,

2660
01:45:59,251 --> 01:46:01,200
is what everybody really,
nobody,

2661
01:46:01,201 --> 01:46:03,840
nobody could relate to cycling and they
got to figure it out.

2662
01:46:03,841 --> 01:46:04,950
They started to watch it.
That cool.

2663
01:46:04,951 --> 01:46:05,784
You want,
again,

2664
01:46:06,030 --> 01:46:08,310
the cancer part of it,
everybody can relate to.

2665
01:46:08,311 --> 01:46:08,761
Right.
I mean,

2666
01:46:08,761 --> 01:46:11,070
every,
everybody is either had the disease

2667
01:46:11,071 --> 01:46:15,570
themselves or lost a loved one or had a
loved one or friend or neighbor affected

2668
01:46:15,571 --> 01:46:17,070
by it.
So they're like,

2669
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:18,510
all right,
I'm in like,

2670
01:46:18,511 --> 01:46:20,770
that is some bullshit right there that
dizzy.

2671
01:46:21,690 --> 01:46:23,430
And they rallied around that.
And that's,

2672
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:25,673
you know,
that's,

2673
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:28,780
that's why that fall came swift and
harsh.

2674
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:31,830
Well,
there's parallels in life when it comes

2675
01:46:31,831 --> 01:46:34,860
to this story and a lot of ways because
everything is kind of messy,

2676
01:46:35,310 --> 01:46:35,760
you know,
the,

2677
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:36,181
the,
the,

2678
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:40,320
the reality versus the narrative,
it's always messy.

2679
01:46:40,350 --> 01:46:42,450
Yeah.
And there's so many variables that don't

2680
01:46:42,451 --> 01:46:45,390
get discussed,
and there's so many aspects of it that

2681
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:48,370
they're flexible and they move around
and,

2682
01:46:48,371 --> 01:46:50,040
and that's,
yeah.

2683
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:51,350
I mean,
more and more now,

2684
01:46:51,351 --> 01:46:53,810
I mean,
the transparency we see in our society

2685
01:46:53,811 --> 01:46:57,170
today,
whether it's politicians or politics or

2686
01:46:57,171 --> 01:46:59,580
sports or entertainment and just,
I mean,

2687
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:01,280
do,
do you imagine,

2688
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:02,390
like,
I always say like,

2689
01:47:02,391 --> 01:47:02,850
you know,
if,

2690
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:04,400
if,
if I give you three names that were

2691
01:47:04,401 --> 01:47:05,780
alive today,
like Sinatra,

2692
01:47:05,781 --> 01:47:06,351
we just,
you know,

2693
01:47:06,351 --> 01:47:11,351
just had celebrated his hundredth
birthday [inaudible] you took Sinatra,

2694
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:14,150
JFK,
and Michael Jordan,

2695
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:16,340
and they,
and they were at their peak today.

2696
01:47:17,350 --> 01:47:22,200
TMZ alone would be nuking people.
Yeah.

2697
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,920
And so,
uh,

2698
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:25,150
it just,
it's,

2699
01:47:25,390 --> 01:47:28,000
it's,
we're just getting deeper and deeper

2700
01:47:28,001 --> 01:47:28,950
into that.
Yeah.

2701
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
It's,
and I think this is just,

2702
01:47:31,001 --> 01:47:32,530
there's no end to the beginning.
Yeah.

2703
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:33,070
Oh,
for sure.

2704
01:47:33,070 --> 01:47:34,960
Well,
I think what's going on with technology

2705
01:47:34,961 --> 01:47:39,580
too is we're seeing this very obvious
trend that the boundaries between people

2706
01:47:39,581 --> 01:47:42,310
and thoughts and ideas and reality and
facts.

2707
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:44,140
Yep.
They're getting smaller and smaller and

2708
01:47:44,141 --> 01:47:46,030
smaller to the point where they're going
to be erased.

2709
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:47,860
And I don't know how it's going to
happen,

2710
01:47:47,861 --> 01:47:51,700
but I think it's going to happen with
something that connects us and in a much

2711
01:47:51,701 --> 01:47:55,180
more personal way than peripheral
devices like laptops or phones.

2712
01:47:55,480 --> 01:48:00,250
I think there's gonna be some technology
that connects us body to body,

2713
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:04,030
whether it's some sort of a neural
implant or something along those lines.

2714
01:48:04,031 --> 01:48:05,350
Yeah.
I really do.

2715
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:07,040
I think it's on inevitable.
Yeah.

2716
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:09,060
I mean,
the symbiotic relationship that we have

2717
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:12,220
with cell phones right now is
undeniable.

2718
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:13,330
I leave my fault.
Like you,

2719
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:14,980
you dropped your phone and you're like,
fuck,

2720
01:48:14,981 --> 01:48:16,510
where's my phone?
My phone's broken.

2721
01:48:16,511 --> 01:48:17,111
Fuck,
fuck.

2722
01:48:17,111 --> 01:48:17,580
Fuck

2723
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:18,413
no here.
Yeah.

2724
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:20,610
Yeah.
I mean,

2725
01:48:20,611 --> 01:48:21,810
I dropped it,
so I did drop my phone,

2726
01:48:21,811 --> 01:48:24,390
but I'm like,
I'm like fucking scratching myself

2727
01:48:24,430 --> 01:48:26,100
because I haven't had the phone for like
two or three hours.

2728
01:48:26,101 --> 01:48:26,821
Yeah,
dude,

2729
01:48:26,821 --> 01:48:28,740
it's,
that ain't good.

2730
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:29,663
No,
it's not good.

2731
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:33,510
I leave my phone sometimes in the,
in the car when I go do the podcast and

2732
01:48:33,511 --> 01:48:36,510
I don't realize that I left it and I'll
be in the middle of a great podcast.

2733
01:48:36,530 --> 01:48:39,180
Like my phone's not here.
I'm not even gonna use it.

2734
01:48:39,181 --> 01:48:40,470
It's out there.
I don't touch it.

2735
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,800
But the fact that it's not physically
like I want it right there.

2736
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,030
You know you're on here and you just
start like,

2737
01:48:47,190 --> 01:48:49,490
you know you've got some guests on,
you're like texting him and the guests

2738
01:48:49,491 --> 01:48:51,120
will be like,
what the fuck?

2739
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:51,830
What's he do?
Yeah,

2740
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:56,000
I come all the way over here.
This godforsaken valley and that la

2741
01:48:56,001 --> 01:48:56,400
traffic

2742
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,000
and the guy's on his phone.
Yeah.

2743
01:48:58,001 --> 01:49:00,700
Well I have had people that are guests
that start checking their twitter.

2744
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,460
Like Neal Brennan would try and start
checking his twitter in the middle of

2745
01:49:03,461 --> 01:49:04,660
pocket.
What the fuck are you doing?

2746
01:49:04,690 --> 01:49:05,920
I want to see what people are saying
about it.

2747
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:08,230
Talk to them afterwards.
Just flip your people.

2748
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:11,290
You don't let people call in and ask
questions or ask questions.

2749
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:14,290
We've done that before.
But the problem is that people that want

2750
01:49:14,291 --> 01:49:16,080
to do it are usually trolls.
You know,

2751
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:21,840
some of those might be fun.
I like if I wanted that kind of a show,

2752
01:49:22,151 --> 01:49:24,250
I would do an all call.
And she did a talk,

2753
01:49:24,251 --> 01:49:26,770
I did a talk a couple of couple months
ago

2754
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:31,530
in Denver and the 600 people and it was
kind of a moderated q and a and then we,

2755
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:34,420
and then the audience was allowed to ask
questions and people were cool.

2756
01:49:34,421 --> 01:49:37,390
They were asking questions in the
moderator says in,

2757
01:49:37,391 --> 01:49:40,750
there's a line to get to the mic desk
questions and the guy says,

2758
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:41,870
ah,
not that this light,

2759
01:49:41,871 --> 01:49:44,170
I'm not connecting,
you know,

2760
01:49:44,171 --> 01:49:46,010
calling her a troll.
But the guy says,

2761
01:49:46,011 --> 01:49:48,340
is anybody in really

2762
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:49,870
pissed at Lance?
And one ask a question,

2763
01:49:49,871 --> 01:49:51,400
this lady in the back,
she's like me,

2764
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:55,060
she comes trucking up there.
And so,

2765
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:56,020
you know,
I was like,

2766
01:49:56,080 --> 01:50:00,040
this is going to be super interesting.
Like what the hell is she going to ask

2767
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:01,300
me?
How am I going to answer it?

2768
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:03,480
So I,
I,

2769
01:50:03,650 --> 01:50:04,570
I,
you know,

2770
01:50:04,571 --> 01:50:07,570
maybe I like a challenge,
but you definitely like a challenge.

2771
01:50:07,571 --> 01:50:11,080
I think you're just bored.
And between Golf Games you want to spar

2772
01:50:11,081 --> 01:50:14,710
with somebody verbally ask kids if my
phone got fixed.

2773
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:17,650
Did he text you?
He's probably out there.

2774
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:20,540
I looked when I went to them and so the
bathroom is a hawk.

2775
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:21,400
Cool.
Thanks.

2776
01:50:21,401 --> 01:50:23,650
That's the last thing he said here.
I'll text him right now.

2777
01:50:23,651 --> 01:50:27,570
You are out there who says hot,
cool things he did because he said,

2778
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:28,840
can,
I said you wanted it advil.

2779
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:30,970
He says,
I said,

2780
01:50:30,971 --> 01:50:32,800
lance would like you to bring advil.

2781
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:33,461
He says,
hoc.

2782
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:34,300
Cool,
thanks.

2783
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:35,760
And I said,
uh,

2784
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:37,990
yeah,
it was his birthday last night.

2785
01:50:38,510 --> 01:50:42,640
We went out to dinner and just we got w
way too drunk.

2786
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:46,930
It happens.
It happens.

2787
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:48,910
Um,
what we were talking about about

2788
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:54,240
technology though about uh,
bringing people closer together in this,

2789
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:56,620
the fact that there's going to,
I mean,

2790
01:50:56,621 --> 01:50:58,180
I really think there's going to be no
secrets.

2791
01:50:58,181 --> 01:51:00,400
I don't think anybody's going to have
secrets from anybody in the future.

2792
01:51:00,401 --> 01:51:01,480
Right.
I think,

2793
01:51:01,481 --> 01:51:03,330
um,
you kind of,

2794
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:08,690
you caught like the wave of this trend
before it got even crazier than it.

2795
01:51:09,150 --> 01:51:12,100
I mean,
you caught that wave and even in 2012

2796
01:51:12,370 --> 01:51:16,000
the comparison between 2012 and 2015
it's like it's ramped up.

2797
01:51:16,001 --> 01:51:18,270
Consider it for sure and will continue
to do that yet.

2798
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:19,990
Yeah.
There's no getting around it,

2799
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,200
right?
Yeah.

2800
01:51:21,310 --> 01:51:22,600
Is that good?
Is that a good thing

2801
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,660
or is it just what it is?

2802
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:28,930
Yeah.
You and I are not going to stop it so

2803
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:32,140
that it's inevitable.
No one is nobody's.

2804
01:51:32,530 --> 01:51:35,530
I think it's going to not just,
Oh,

2805
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:37,810
it's just,
it's one of the things it's going to

2806
01:51:37,811 --> 01:51:40,120
happen is it's not going to just be
celebrities.

2807
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:41,560
It's not going to be just people like
you.

2808
01:51:41,561 --> 01:51:45,040
People like Michael Jordan or whoever.
It's going to be everybody.

2809
01:51:45,070 --> 01:51:45,731
Right.
It's going to be,

2810
01:51:45,731 --> 01:51:47,190
if you want to find out anything about
Jamie,

2811
01:51:47,191 --> 01:51:50,710
it's going to be all on the table.
Maybe Jamie was one of those Ashley

2812
01:51:50,710 --> 01:51:54,810
Madison Clients.
He could have been the odd Wicki was ah,

2813
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:58,030
well there had been some fucking
ridiculous people that were that one up

2814
01:51:58,031 --> 01:52:00,820
killing themselves when like preachers
and shit like that,

2815
01:52:00,821 --> 01:52:04,960
that it was found out.
But how dumb do you have to be to think

2816
01:52:04,961 --> 01:52:08,150
that that's going to be secure?
You're going to go on some dating site.

2817
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:10,170
I mean,
come on man.

2818
01:52:10,171 --> 01:52:11,004
I'm like,
Ooh,

2819
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:12,820
that's,
that's insane.

2820
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:18,100
But you know what kind of a fucking
Weirdo wants to find out about people

2821
01:52:18,101 --> 01:52:19,300
that were on the dating site?
Like,

2822
01:52:19,330 --> 01:52:20,440
well,
what do you give a shit?

2823
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:21,520
Leave me alone.
Exactly.

2824
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:23,080
But that's not the world we live in.
Right.

2825
01:52:23,110 --> 01:52:24,930
I gotta take a leak again.
You do you well,

2826
01:52:24,931 --> 01:52:26,490
it's what's in this fucking thing.
What's in it?

2827
01:52:26,491 --> 01:52:27,160
Yeah,
we're good.

2828
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:29,980
We're done.
I think 1130 it's 11 supposed to tee off

2829
01:52:29,981 --> 01:52:31,570
at 1130 but all right,
where are you?

2830
01:52:31,630 --> 01:52:31,980
Really?
Yeah,

2831
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:33,490
but I'll find it.
I'm going to meet him out there.

2832
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:34,650
It's all okay.
It's all good man.

2833
01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:35,730
Thank you lance.
Really appreciate.

2834
01:52:35,770 --> 01:52:37,180
Thank you.
Thanks for doing that.

2835
01:52:37,181 --> 01:52:38,380
And thanks for listening,
whoever.

2836
01:52:38,410 --> 01:52:40,330
Hopefully somebody lists.
A lot of people are so cool.

2837
01:52:40,331 --> 01:52:42,490
I'm sure that's it.
Bye everybody.

2838
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:47,660
Bye.
Okay.
