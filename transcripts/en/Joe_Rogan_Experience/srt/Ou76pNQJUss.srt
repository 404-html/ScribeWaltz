1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,140
does he didn't elaborate
any further than that?

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,730
I don't think so.

4
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:06,930
I think he just leaves it that,

5
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:07,710
but still man,

6
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,710
Sean connery gets away with that because
he's handsome and he's got that cool

7
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:11,340
accent.

8
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,790
But imagine somebody else saying that law.

9
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:14,610
Yeah.

10
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,301
It's just bad.

11
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:19,770
I mean ultimately Sean connery is just
hitting women from an old school era,

12
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:21,070
so it's kind of funny to hear them.

13
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:21,330
Yeah.

14
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:21,871
That's why.

15
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:22,980
Because of like jude law,

16
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,300
don't know why I'm saying jude law again,

17
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:25,740
but he has a proper accent.

18
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:26,760
Is a handsome guy.

19
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,860
If he wound up saying
that in an interview,

20
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,840
it would ruin his career.

21
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:31,290
Yeah,

22
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,970
absolutely ruined his career.

23
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,720
Like who's a famous movie star today?

24
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,350
Who's like a good example
like Ryan Reynolds,

25
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,090
I guess at the handsome guy.

26
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,350
I'm not sure that it's one of those.

27
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,213
Ryan Ryan's.

28
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,820
Imagine if Ryan seacrest said
that it would know he's gay.

29
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,980
People would know that.

30
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,140
Like,

31
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,973
I know what you're doing,

32
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,533
right?

33
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,723
No,

34
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,993
no,

35
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,791
no.

36
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:57,511
I don't think he's gay.

37
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:58,620
I think he's a workaholic.

38
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:00,980
Probably doesn't have time for sex.

39
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,201
Okay.

40
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:01,730
This guy,

41
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,550
Ryan Reynolds,

42
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,480
this handsome bastard.

43
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,523
If he said that,

44
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,860
if Ryan Reynolds said that sometimes
you need to smack a mount holy shit with

45
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:08,580
the backlash,

46
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,840
be extraordinary.

47
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,900
Salon Dot Com would dedicate months
and months of of front page articles.

48
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:15,600
Yeah,

49
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,160
but what about all the
sites defending him?

50
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,830
None.

51
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,540
None.

52
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:18,930
None.

53
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,410
None.

54
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,100
None.

55
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,350
There'll be a few of those
bugs in men's rights.

56
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,050
Sean Connery Fan clubs.

57
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,110
Few of those embarrassing men's rights
sites were the right things like,

58
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:28,261
oh,

59
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:28,840
come on.

60
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,970
Why is you went too far?

61
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,511
You fucks.

62
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:31,710
You ruined the whole argument.

63
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,200
The whole argument is divorced laws.

64
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:34,921
The whole argument,

65
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:37,030
the whole argument is how many
guys get fucked over financials?

66
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,620
So weird salon.com started
attacking patent Oswald.

67
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,321
You know,

68
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:42,540
it's not salon.com.

69
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,080
Okay.

70
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,010
It's a writer.

71
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,090
A writer decided that they were going
to pick a hot button topic that didn't

72
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:49,950
necessarily jive or make sense,

73
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,100
but they felt like because Patton Oswald
was making fun of someone else's racism

74
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:58,880
by showing like essentially
very similar to a Co.

75
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:01,830
Barriers get in trouble
for it except patton.

76
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:06,831
Oswald is a fucking like oBvious
comedian and obviously known as a pretty

77
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,440
sensitive aware guy,

78
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,430
like the idea that he would say
something racist just for the joke,

79
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,503
like he was,

80
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,170
they knew what he was doing and
they decided to go for it anyway,

81
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,760
and that's when he attacked them,

82
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:22,230
lit up and he should have,

83
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,670
he should have their gross.

84
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,590
Like there's something about their,

85
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:25,920
uh,

86
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,210
their articles too.

87
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,830
If you go to salon.com,

88
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:32,010
one of the things is almost every
article starts with a question,

89
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,353
you know,

90
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:33,900
is,

91
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,271
you know,

92
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:38,910
is this the time to reconsider the
argument of who's funnier men or women?

93
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,260
Question mark is this,

94
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,370
you know,

95
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,203
this is this.

96
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,220
What's wrong with the right question mark,

97
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:44,371
you know,

98
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,020
like this.

99
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,410
It's,

100
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,243
it's weird.

101
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,080
They're like opinion pieces
that represent this article.

102
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,221
It just is like,

103
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:50,371
it's,

104
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,080
it's amazingly this guess,

105
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,670
guess what chicken butt does.

106
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:56,340
Anti vegan shaming beginning in preschool.

107
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,440
Is that they're a salon articles?

108
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:02,920
Yeah.

109
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,251
Hold on.

110
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:07,120
Mr. Show patriarchal hedge
among in sketch show titles.

111
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,980
That's the man from nantucket anti
transgender subtext and classic lillard's.

112
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,680
So true.

113
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,640
It's so true.

114
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,243
Knock knock joke.

115
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,170
Not inclusive to the
homeless salon articles.

116
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,370
You dummies.

117
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,810
You fucked with the wrong guy.

118
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,321
Yeah,

119
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:23,891
you did.

120
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:24,724
Who lit them up?

121
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,751
She's right,

122
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:26,320
man.

123
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,540
I mean I get angry sometimes.

124
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,930
Like the other day they were
comparing tina fey to um,

125
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,980
to louis ck and like,

126
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,430
it's the age old argument.

127
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,061
Who's funnier?

128
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:37,894
Men or women?

129
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,830
Fuck you.

130
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:39,970
Fuck you.

131
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,830
Here's what's funnier.

132
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,770
Funny people.

133
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,090
It's not men or women.

134
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,080
Stop.

135
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,520
Amy schumer's hilarious.

136
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,600
Louis ck layers and tina fey by
the way is in even a stand up.

137
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,800
Right?

138
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,210
Okay.

139
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,130
She's an actress.

140
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:51,964
She's funny.

141
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,350
She's funny on shows.

142
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:55,120
She's funny and in movies,

143
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,980
but she's not louis ck.

144
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,420
Lucy get writes his own shit.

145
00:03:58,421 --> 00:03:59,260
Performed his own shit.

146
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,740
It's all his opinions on
the world to save that,

147
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,210
that there's some sort of
a debate who's funnier.

148
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,800
Her him is completely distorting what
the art form is in the first place.

149
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,570
It's completely distorting it.

150
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,390
Like you're just looking for a
fucking salacious article title.

151
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,290
That's all you're doing.

152
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:14,980
I used to think,

153
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,730
I thought,

154
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,750
I thought they were like,

155
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,530
it seems like they were much more
respected and now they've gone down this

156
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:23,170
spiral where everyone's just
rolling their eyes at it.

157
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,550
They'll run out of shit to talk about.

158
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,070
Well,

159
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,590
you know,

160
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,860
it's just ridiculous.

161
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:27,700
It gets to a certain.

162
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,450
It gets a certain time when
you're covering the same
stories over and over and

163
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:32,680
over and over and over and over.

164
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,461
This cancel.

165
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:34,430
Colbert cancel.

166
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,930
Cold beer.

167
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,880
One fucking joke is merited like seven
or eight headlines for articles from

168
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:40,600
them,

169
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,530
like in the debate,

170
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,940
why he needs to make it right.

171
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,960
Make it right.

172
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,340
Jesus fucking christ like,

173
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,780
what are you talking about?

174
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,490
Make a joke,

175
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:49,180
right?

176
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,230
What was his joke?

177
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,130
I mean it was so.

178
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,480
First of all,

179
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,640
he's a character.

180
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,110
He's a right wing,

181
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:59,290
ridiculous character that says dumb shit.

182
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,000
Tongue in cheek every fucking step of
the way it was it offensive to asian

183
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:04,650
people.

184
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:04,831
I'll,

185
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:05,070
I'll,

186
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,320
I'll,

187
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,260
I'll pull it up right now so we could
see what the fucking colbert controversy.

188
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,913
I'll,

189
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,031
I'll pull it up,

190
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,940
but people are asking like hash tagging.

191
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,590
Hashtagging canceled co bear
because of a fucking joke.

192
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,521
Okay,

193
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,151
here's the,

194
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:22,984
uh,

195
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,390
here's the in.

196
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,110
He's apparently responded to it,

197
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:26,950
but let's find out what,

198
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,620
how many visits,

199
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,590
how many people did
respond to that hashtag.

200
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:30,701
Oh,

201
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:31,331
I don't know,

202
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,560
but they're all gross.

203
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,510
I don't know how many
people wondering how big,

204
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:35,860
if it's an actual big,

205
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,800
now it's pretty mint is it?

206
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,820
You can scan through it
and it's not just canceled.

207
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:40,271
Cole bear,

208
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:40,650
there's like.

209
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,471
It's just like that.

210
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:45,400
It's like a place where all the outrage
people have gone to express they're

211
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,060
outrageous.

212
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,050
They're pissed about anything,

213
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,510
and they'll just hashtag page right now.

214
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:49,960
Here's,

215
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,651
here's what they said.

216
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,484
Okay.

217
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,270
It all began thursday evening when
the coal baer reports twitter account,

218
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:55,571
by the way,

219
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:56,440
which wasn't even him.

220
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,510
It wasn't even him that wrote that was
someone that handles the kobe or account.

221
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,200
It's not,

222
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,471
it's not.

223
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:04,490
StePhen colbert quoted a joke from
a segment on wednesday's episode,

224
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:07,400
so they quoted a joke from a segment.

225
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,100
SO they took it out of context
and that's where the outrage came.

226
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,430
Quoted a joke from a segment that aired
that marked Washington redskins owner

227
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:20,060
dan schneider for setting up a charity
to aid native americans in lieu of

228
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,500
changing the team's name,

229
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,870
the original bid,

230
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,230
cole bear said he was inspired
by schneider to start his
own charity called the

231
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:32,120
ching chong ding dong foundation for
sensitivity to orientals or whatever.

232
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,840
That's in response to a guy who runs
a team called the Washington redskins,

233
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:43,270
which is an anti native american
slur making a charity for,

234
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,210
for,

235
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,140
for native americans,

236
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:45,980
without changing the name.

237
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:49,730
like here's the whole
context to that joke.

238
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,210
I mean,

239
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,590
he's not saying that there should be
a ching chong ding dong foundation.

240
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,740
He's mocking the racism of a guy
whose team is called a racist name.

241
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,140
Donating without changing the name.

242
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,660
I mean it's so obvious,

243
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,410
but salon has had like seven
fucking articles about it.

244
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,460
Some supportive,

245
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,560
but some would say he
needs to make it right.

246
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:16,430
Maybe you just cannot put that string
of words together in any context ever.

247
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:17,180
but I mean,

248
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,900
whatever he said,

249
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,190
I think that's exactly
what they're saying.

250
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,024
You can't say change.

251
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,841
You can't say that.

252
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,950
That's the n word.

253
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,000
It's hilarious.

254
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,103
I mean to to,

255
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,500
to,

256
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,500
to try to censor content content that
much that you've taken things completely

257
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:31,154
out of context,

258
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,080
completely out of the meaning and context
is the reason why language exists in

259
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:36,800
the first place.

260
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,800
It's everything to be able to expand
past really simple things like eat fuck

261
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:43,280
shit.

262
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,750
you need context to to have a goddamn
language and communicate each other.

263
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:51,230
We have to recognize subtleties and
when you pretend they don't exist,

264
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,210
that's when you get assholes sanctimonious
fuckheads who get crazy about jokes

265
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,960
that you can get people dedicated days
and days of their life to something that

266
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:03,650
fucking that tracy morgan says
about stabbing his gay son.

267
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,180
They're crazy.

268
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,920
Everything is taken completely out of
context and everything is something that

269
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,250
really warrants cancellation you.

270
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,280
You'd be shamed.

271
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,750
You need to be removed.

272
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,420
This is over-sensitive fucking moron.

273
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:22,670
It's weird how what you're expressing
right now is you're offended.

274
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,360
They offend you.

275
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,720
That's what's interesting
is it's like they.

276
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,180
What they are doing is so
much more offensive in the
thing they are offended by

277
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,540
the way they're expressing themselves
is so vile and disgusting that it makes

278
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:42,990
whatever tracy morgan said
or patent oswald said,

279
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,250
or cole bear say,

280
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,910
just seem like seem so tiny
compared to what they are,

281
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:50,850
which is they're like embryonic fascists.

282
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:53,670
If you gave them power and
they grew out of control,

283
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:54,240
if that,

284
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,610
whoever's like running the show at salon,

285
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,211
matt,

286
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:59,400
whoever's running the cancel,

287
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:01,710
cole bear in somehow they took power.

288
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,110
Imagine what kind of world would be
living god if you they could decide what

289
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,180
gets on these comedy shows.

290
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,810
Satire shows what you can
and can't get away with.

291
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,330
How many transgenders
need to be represented?

292
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,340
How many fucking gay people
need to be represented?

293
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,780
how many fucking straight white males
need to be made fun of along with straight

294
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:22,650
white females.

295
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:23,000
I mean,

296
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,060
is it going to be a a chart where
everything's graft and made sure it's

297
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:28,950
completely even across the board?

298
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,150
Let's not life,

299
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:30,451
man.

300
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:33,240
Maybe they'll find something new to be
pissed off about because that's really

301
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,460
what they love is being
pissed off about stuff.

302
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:35,701
Oh,

303
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,220
they'd where they'd realized
that they lost their love,

304
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:39,054
which is the problem.

305
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:39,250
It's,

306
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,800
it's when you say they,

307
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,270
it's writers.

308
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,070
It's writers that they're attracting.

309
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,470
It's not necessarily logical people.

310
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,270
It's not necessarily representative
of the organization itself,

311
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:54,820
their individual writers who produce
something and then somebody greenlights

312
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,560
set,

313
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,260
but at a certain point in time you're
doing more harm than good because you're

314
00:09:58,261 --> 00:09:59,270
so easy to mock,

315
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:04,080
but if you're like super left wing when
you get that far out on a fucking limb

316
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,880
and you want to cancel coca cola,

317
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,640
bear about a really
obvious joke like that.

318
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,930
You're fucking up everything cause you're.

319
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,680
You're making yourself
look unbelievably silly.

320
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,010
Like I know you feel right and I know
that you have this righteous indignation

321
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:22,170
behind what you're doing and you feel
like the that people need to know.

322
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,450
You need to realize the
harm that your word say.

323
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,990
You need to realize that
there's humor and humor.

324
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,033
People get hurt,

325
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:29,331
oh,

326
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:29,600
hiding,

327
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,040
but you're a bigot.

328
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,150
Hiding behind the mask of a comedian,

329
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,103
people get hurt,

330
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,160
people get hurt from jokes,

331
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:35,700
and guess what?

332
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,630
If you get hurt from jokes,

333
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,340
you're supposed to get
hurt from those jokes.

334
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,800
If you can't make fun of
something about yourself,

335
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,110
that means that you haven't acknowledged
that something about yourself that may

336
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:44,250
or may not be hilarious,

337
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,030
and there's a big difference
between someone saying
something unbelievably cruel

338
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:51,600
and evil and someone's saying something
where they're poking at you and laughing

339
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,210
and obviously he was doing that.

340
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,100
Obviously he was poking at the Washington
redskins guy and laughing and to deny

341
00:10:59,101 --> 00:10:59,934
that it's just.

342
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,560
It fucks up the whole argument.

343
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,810
It clouds the water was shitheads.

344
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,141
Yeah.

345
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:07,560
It's strange to see salon.com in some way,

346
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:12,390
like converging with
nancy grace in some way,

347
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:12,721
right?

348
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:13,020
Yeah.

349
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,280
Like they're meeting somehow.

350
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:16,110
Salon is like put itself in this tear.

351
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,010
whoever the writers are.

352
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,530
Ours put themselves in that
awful position where it's like,

353
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,393
oh shit,

354
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,420
I'm nancy.

355
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:26,280
Grace and I were like singing the
same song and it's not all that.

356
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,660
There's a lot of great articles on there.

357
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:29,880
I still go there because they
have a lot of great articles.

358
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,910
It's just sometimes
they just go out along.

359
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,120
That's why you need a good editor man,

360
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:36,990
because you let a few riders fucking
throw stuff out there and you do serious

361
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:39,990
damage to your website or magazine.

362
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:43,890
Like you can really fuck your shit up
where you could develop a reputation.

363
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,540
You develop a bad reputation,

364
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,490
like a reputation for being ridiculous.

365
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,750
Oswald is attacking you for fun.

366
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:55,120
if people are looking forward
to it and it rings true,

367
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,060
that's the problem is
true what he's saying.

368
00:11:58,061 --> 00:11:58,510
Yeah.

369
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,740
He read those titles.

370
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,693
They're all.

371
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,460
Those are great mock salon.com titles.

372
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:04,294
They're great.

373
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:04,780
You know,

374
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,141
but look,

375
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,960
if you go to like I get an email from
them every day and there's some great

376
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:12,010
things like the thing with John Stewart
mocking cnn for its continued coverage,

377
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:12,844
they've got that.

378
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,600
They've got an interesting
thing on chris christie,

379
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,810
the governor to about
are not all bad at all.

380
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:20,260
You know?

381
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,160
Not all bad at all,

382
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:24,040
but a friend of mine
hate advice for awhile.

383
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,431
He's like,

384
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:25,720
fuck that magazine because.

385
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,680
Because one article that he was offended
by and they came up five years ago,

386
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,180
but I mean,

387
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,361
yeah,

388
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:35,160
you can't blame the whole organization
because one thing fucked up right.
