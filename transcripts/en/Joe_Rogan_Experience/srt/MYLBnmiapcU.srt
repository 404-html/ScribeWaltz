1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,260
The joe rogan experience.
Do you think the people create that?

2
00:00:03,261 --> 00:00:04,460
I mean,
that's like the big a,

3
00:00:04,461 --> 00:00:06,050
the big hippy,
new age.

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,770
A argument about lives that you create
these possibilities in life,

5
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:11,960
that you,
you're responsible for all these

6
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:14,450
different events that are happening too.
They're not random events.

7
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:18,650
These are events that are sort of
created by your own intentions.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,170
Yes.
Do you feel that sometimes,

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,870
absolutely.
One thing I learned was that till you

10
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:25,850
take responsibility,
you ain't gonna move forward.

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,340
There's mother fuckers that get off the
stage,

12
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:33,341
bro.
Audio sucks the sound that I watched a

13
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:36,740
guy eat the pie.
Fuck ate shit.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,250
Fucking bombed.
Yeah.

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,210
And that's it.
And everything else.

16
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:44,420
And until you come through that you
can't really,

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,120
and that was big for me that I believe
that,

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,751
you know,
and listen,

19
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:49,010
I go to bed now,
I go home,

20
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:51,920
I put my feet up,
I watch the news and I go to bed like

21
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:52,130
nothing.

22
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,990
You know,
20 years ago I didn't go to bed late.

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,970
I had to shut my window a certain way
and close my door,

24
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,660
shut away,
and I couldn't leave the light on at

25
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:03,170
night because I owed money to a drug
dealer like rob somebody.

26
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,480
I created all those scenarios.
I didn't,

27
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,750
I didn't make that kidnapping up.
I went there with a gun.

28
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:11,440
I knew that was doing,
but it's funny that quick,

29
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:14,620
the turnaround was between like 99 you
know,

30
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,670
like it's,
it all just sort of stopped and also

31
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,460
luggage and it kept stopping.
You know,

32
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:21,980
it kept stopping and kept getting
better.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,860
What you're telling me is that I never
did blog at after 2006 that's,

34
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:30,410
you're trying to tell me who me.
That's you're trying to tell me to say

35
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,340
the weirdest way to phrase that
sentence.

36
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:37,710
I'm saying that I haven't done Boston
show.

37
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,630
One day I went home one day I went home
because even with a chick,

38
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,960
so one day I went home and just stopped
doing book.

39
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,260
That's it.
You're trying to tell me you've never

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,740
done that again.
That's what I'm saying.

41
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,060
I'm saying about being a criminal.
No,

42
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,250
no,
no,

43
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:48,650
no,
no.

44
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,590
I'm busting your balls.
I can't believe what I'm fucking telling

45
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:54,420
you.
That's nice.

46
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,360
2006 one day I went home.
Brian,

47
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,870
one day I went home and just stopped
doing cocaine though.

48
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,070
Rehab,
no hug.

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,830
I didn't call nobody.
I didn't piss my ear.

50
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,600
I didn't give my life to our game.
There was none of that shit.

51
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,291
He'll,
okay,

52
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,240
whatever the fuck that shit is,
it can never go.

53
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:14,040
It was nothing.
Whatever the photo book,

54
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,210
game,
Whatever Shit.

55
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,900
So my point is that what happened was I
dropped.

56
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:22,440
I kept dropping the pain that I had and
that luggage that I had,

57
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:25,860
I forced it out.
I just didn't fucking stop doing drugs.

58
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,220
I overcame whatever was making me do
those fucking drugs.

59
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,380
Society wasn't making me do drugs.
Obama care.

60
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:34,920
How funny is that?
They found heroin in the Bronx with

61
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,420
obamacare envelope.
Austin,

62
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,650
Boston man hysteric instead obamacare on
it was on heroin.

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,320
Obamacare,
like people would just let that in.

64
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,840
Everything we create everything in a lot
of wings.

65
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,900
This random things can happen as well.
I broke this.

66
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:55,020
Sometimes people wake up on the wrong
side of the fucking bed.

67
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:58,020
They come at you and you got to stand
your fucking ground and you got to say

68
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,310
no bitch.
And people get their feelings hurt.

69
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,720
Yes,
but no,

70
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,210
I created a lot of the shit that
happened in my life.

71
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:04,840
There's no fuck

72
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,870
what?
Sink into what you are right now.

73
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,580
Just be that thing.
Stop resisting exactly where you are

74
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,680
right now is perfect.
And that's a hard truth to grasp because

75
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,120
you think right away you think.
Yeah.

76
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:22,850
What about fucking Jeffrey Dahmer?
Is he perfect?

77
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,890
Well,
what about the leopard when you're

78
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:28,130
seeing a leopard rip apart a creature?
Is that thing per,

79
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:28,964
is that a perfect,

80
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,420
don't think the Leopard fucks them and
kills him.

81
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,660
But do you know what ducks do?
Ducks or necrophilia acts.

82
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,170
Are they fucking evil creatures?

83
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,540
Yes,
I think they are.

84
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,880
Yeah,
they are made that Phil Robertson Guy,

85
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:44,080
very famous person,
and he invented a call for them and now

86
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:48,070
poor gay people have to hear that a
man's anus is not as good as a woman's

87
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:50,080
vagina.
Can you imagine if you made the choice

88
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:54,040
for a man's anus and you hear this
fucking big bearded fashion Easter with

89
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,730
his Camo on a Bandana is absolute
fashiony so weird.

90
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:01,310
I never thought of that.
Big bearded Christian Bible slinging

91
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,890
Fashionista.
And uh,

92
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,910
he tells you that your choice was
incorrect and in fact the woman's vagina

93
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,220
is the better choice.
The man's anus.

94
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:10,720
I mean,
come on guys.

95
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,780
But as you say that,
if you haven't experienced it,

96
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,011
maybe,
yeah,

97
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,330
I think he has a,
again,

98
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:19,660
the balance theory,
I think he's so outspoken on that issue.

99
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,410
Like most of these homophobes are
because they're home jerking off to gay

100
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:24,810
porn,
you know,

101
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,450
otherwise you just don't give a shit.

102
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,660
It's a closing actually matter.
Right?

103
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,960
It doesn't come up in a gq interview.
It's a duck thing,

104
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:32,950
right?
It's like Duh,

105
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:34,750
ready?
Like if you really care if people are

106
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,830
gay,
Duh,

107
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,140
you really care.
The two guys love each other and that

108
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:41,380
you are you against love.
You only like love if it's a man and a

109
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,880
woman.
Like what the fuck man?

110
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:45,700
Really,
it's done.

111
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,070
It is talking about men's anuses in Gq.
Sorry,

112
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,130
Glen,
maybe you've got some issues to think

113
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:52,840
about.
What shouldn't we just be talking about

114
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:55,420
ducks,
ducks and scene isn't that your whole

115
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:59,020
show was he should ducks all the time,
right?

116
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,910
That's your thing.
Like let's just talk about murdering

117
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:01,631
ducks.
Yeah.

118
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:04,950
Why you got to talk about men's
ragging.

119
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,930
This in the blood sack sucks penises

120
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,550
and that is why that,
you know,

121
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:13,470
the duck dynasty guy or any of these
Weirdos who are um,

122
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,510
um,
you were just ultimately just angry

123
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:20,080
people.
That's why they seem so fucking crazy

124
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,200
war.
They play angry people on TV.

125
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,180
Right?
Cause I think a lot of these people

126
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:26,500
aren't even,
you know,

127
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:30,010
like dynasty guy.
The Duck Dynasty guy has been given

128
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,950
speeches like that for years that these
biblical retreats and stuff,

129
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:35,820
he's been doing that for this video.
So this is real stick.

130
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:39,910
He's not fire and brimstone God fearing
Christian man who was living on the

131
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:43,720
wrong side of the law and Jesus at one
point in time and then turned it all

132
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:46,330
around and wants to let everybody know
about the evils of sin.

133
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,640
He's an old dummy.
That's what he is.

134
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,500
He's an old dominant lobe name for him.
He's an old dummy to probably just one

135
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:57,590
time sucked a dick and liked it way too
much or someone sucked his and it's his

136
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,410
favorite moment.
He looks back on his childhood and he's

137
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,430
turned it into,
you know,

138
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,240
stay rear.
I bet he was going to happen.

139
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,370
We were in that duck blind.
They're all liquored up on moonshine and

140
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:09,200
coats and ducks.
I bet.

141
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,800
Right when he came into like some guy's
mouth years ago,

142
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:15,240
out in the out in the fucking house
swaps,

143
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:20,241
he saw to call it a duck blind combined
pleasure and shame mixed inside of me.

144
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:23,510
He's like,
I'm just going to kill ducks from now on

145
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,420
and never think about this dog.
She didn't see shit.

146
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,070
Your Mother didn't see shit.
Your father didn't see shit.

147
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,000
Nobody saw shit.
I'm good to few magic.

148
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,150
That's really what it was.
All it was just a duck song.

149
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:40,040
Get his dick sucked by a guy and he's
like,

150
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,600
fuck that.
It didn't happen.
