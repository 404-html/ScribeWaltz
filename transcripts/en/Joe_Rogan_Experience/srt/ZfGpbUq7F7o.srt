1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,550
So in your experience and all
these other countries and will,

3
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:04,971
and when you,

4
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:06,170
you see all these different,

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,670
um,

6
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,390
you know,

7
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,680
regimes getting toppled,

8
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,260
you don't think there's any American
influence and these things happening.

9
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,150
I think we're that good.

10
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:13,881
Really.

11
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:14,750
You don't think the CIA?

12
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:15,410
I've,

13
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,250
I've actually,

14
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,750
I'm a CIA nerd.

15
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,610
I'm one of those,

16
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,340
like,

17
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,121
I'm not a Gamer,

18
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:23,510
but I'm a guy who about 25 years ago,

19
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,900
started reading up with
the Kennedy assassination,

20
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,730
gotten kept completely obsessed with that.

21
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:29,630
And then it just,

22
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:29,741
I'm,

23
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:30,441
I'm one of these guys,

24
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:31,750
I read footnotes in a footnote,

25
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,170
leads me to another book to another book.

26
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:33,321
You know,

27
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:36,350
I disappeared down the rat hole
for 10 years reading everything.

28
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:37,184
So I'm really,

29
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,840
did you ever invest evidence?

30
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,381
Uh,

31
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:40,214
yeah.

32
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,353
Um,

33
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:42,790
you know,

34
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,040
my,

35
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,180
my feeling is we're just,

36
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,500
if history has taught us anything,

37
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:48,230
and if you read all of the documents
from all of the controversial periods of

38
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:50,120
CIA operations,

39
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,430
we just don't seem to be
very good at these things.

40
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,390
And,

41
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,370
and everybody rats and
writes a book about it,

42
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:56,440
but immediately afterwards,

43
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,190
so if it went well,

44
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,100
you can be sure you'd be reading about
or would have been leaked to a magazine

45
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:01,491
by now.

46
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:01,711
You know,

47
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:01,830
it's,

48
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,540
I just,

49
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,880
I don't think that's so sad.

50
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,560
I don't think we're that good.

51
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,400
Uh,

52
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:07,751
and I,

53
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:12,750
I certainly don't think we have much of
an appetite for controlling the universe

54
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:14,090
that the group we're doing it.

55
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,061
We seem to be,

56
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:17,690
we work very working very
hard to hold the down.

57
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,183
MMM.

58
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,920
So you think there's speculation
about the CIA being involved?

59
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,600
Like they're probably just very,

60
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:30,890
very peripherally involved and there's
just shit happening no matter what their

61
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,430
major CIA operations going
on right now without it,

62
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,281
without doubt.

63
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:37,670
But I think this notion that there's an
office somewhere where the whole fate of

64
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:40,250
the world is sort of decided
what countries are good,

65
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:41,660
it would fade over the next 10 years.

66
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,590
Uh,

67
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,670
we're just not that good.

68
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,170
And we're not definitely not that secure.

69
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,470
There's always three people
know about something.

70
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,940
It's a greatest argument
about the Kennedy's,

71
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,640
you know,

72
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,860
the nine 11 conspiracy theory idiots.

73
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,640
Um,

74
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,860
the Kennedy assassination,

75
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,380
uh,

76
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,240
looney tunes.

77
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,350
Um,

78
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,100
if basically in this
country of three people,

79
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,680
more than three people know about a thing,

80
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:02,630
one of them is going to be
on the stand crying about it.

81
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:06,260
The other guy is going to be writing a
book about it and maybe two guys will

82
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:07,094
keep their mouth shut.

83
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,380
I think today,

84
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,380
I don't think during the time
of the Kennedy assassination,

85
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:14,750
it would have been that
difficult to hide things.

86
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,531
I think,

87
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:15,980
uh,

88
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,390
things were less,

89
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:20,720
much less transparent back then then
were today you have it his death with

90
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:20,901
greater,

91
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:21,331
but history,

92
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:21,620
you know,

93
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,300
eventually if you're willing
to wait around something,

94
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:25,640
or my VA to my view,

95
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,640
if you're willing to wait around
or every boring grim detail will,

96
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,720
will eventually come out.

97
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:30,101
And,

98
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:31,280
and if you,

99
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,790
as in the Kennedy assessed,

100
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,643
so someone,

101
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't know who said it,

102
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:39,890
they described the mafia theory as the
halfway house for failed conspiracy

103
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:40,341
theorist.

104
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:42,520
It's like after you've
decided to CIA didn't do it.

105
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,880
I did it.

106
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,330
It's like,

107
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:44,630
yeah,

108
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,920
well it was the mafia,

109
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,670
you know,

110
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,460
and there's of course there's all this
great evidence to support that theory,

111
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:49,620
but,

112
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:49,810
but,

113
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,660
but ultimately I'm of the Oswald
got a lucky shot flaring up.

114
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,440
I read best evidence and that's one of
the reasons why I first started believing

115
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:59,710
that there was some sort
of a conspiracy that was,

116
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:00,160
uh,

117
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,521
one of the,

118
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:03,280
one of the first things that I saw
that made me really reconsider.

119
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,600
But later in life,

120
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,910
the thing that really got me
was the Northwoods document.

121
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,121
If you never heard of that,

122
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:13,121
it's something that they drafted in the
1960s or 1960 [inaudible] 61 or 62 where

123
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,660
Kennedy actually vetoed it.

124
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,040
And all the joint chiefs of Staff,

125
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,540
the Joint Chiefs of staff signed it.

126
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,300
And then we're going
to have fake American,

127
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:22,840
uh,

128
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,710
terror attacks.

129
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,730
We're going to get a,

130
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,720
a plane and we're going to have a drone
plane exploded and say a bunch of people

131
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:32,200
died and they were going to attack
Guantanamo Bay and they were going to arm

132
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:34,360
Cuban friendlies to attack Guantanamo Bay.

133
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,720
Cause we wanted to go to this was this,

134
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:39,450
was this a Cuban missile crisis era?

135
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,190
There were,

136
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,840
there were so many complete,

137
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,621
this is what it,

138
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:43,891
to me,

139
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,980
what's interesting about Kennedy's
assassination conspiracy.

140
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,890
There was so much it wacky
shit going on around that time.

141
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:54,060
So much of it embarrassing.

142
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,423
Um,

143
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,840
criminal scary,

144
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,703
funny,

145
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,760
really silly going on at
that time that in fact,

146
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:05,160
the least interesting
thing about the entire,

147
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,330
you know,

148
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,880
big picture of the Kennedy assassination
is the actual assassination itself

149
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,050
because what everybody else was up to
at the time and covering up where it's

150
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:17,190
just like right out of a movie and CIA
get his meeting with Johnny Roselli and

151
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,070
all these like mafia guys
that blackout Castro,

152
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,283
uh,

153
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,170
you know,

154
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,003
uh,

155
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,440
there,

156
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,210
there was just so much other embarrassing
shit going on that in many ways those

157
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:30,690
stories and where they lead or a lot
more entertaining and complex and,

158
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,703
and fun.

159
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,570
Then then a story of a guy,

160
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,021
you know,

161
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:34,920
shooting a president.

162
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,740
So if you believe that Lee
Harvey Oswald acted alone,

163
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:39,530
what are you doing about when you see the,

164
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,860
like the Oliver Stone movie?

165
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,210
Does that drive you fucking crazy?

166
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:42,740
It would've,

167
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,280
I would've liked to fill in a lot better.

168
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,030
Um,

169
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,690
if they just stuck with a historical
record and he invented scenes and

170
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:49,351
characters,

171
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:49,591
you know,

172
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:50,930
which I thought was as a,

173
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,983
as a,

174
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,100
as a Kennedy assassination plot
and character didn't exist.

175
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:55,440
Right.

176
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,920
And there were just certain things we're
just do mention that the garrison jury

177
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:00,840
was out for like 30 seconds.

178
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,720
He's mentioned the Jim Garrison is
a man of many interesting local,

179
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,633
uh,

180
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,470
a man with an interesting pass,

181
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:12,040
let's put it that way and not go away.

182
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,490
He did not,

183
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,240
uh,

184
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,651
not,

185
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:16,484
uh,

186
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,210
a reputation that was debatable,

187
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:19,044
let's put it that way.

188
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,273
Um,

189
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,390
which is never good.

190
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,590
The case was bad.

191
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,210
I mean he put a lot of very interesting
stuff together and there was an,

192
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:29,700
all of it was like
fascinating and a lot of ways,

193
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,900
a lot of it was,

194
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,880
it was almost more interesting than the,

195
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,410
than that there wasn't,

196
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:35,820
I don't believe in the octopus theory.

197
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,650
I think you had a lot
of really interesting,

198
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:40,920
very spooky characters who've been
doing a lot of really sinister,

199
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,251
uh,

200
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:42,660
an interesting shit for a long time.

201
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:45,570
Whether or not they were actually
involved in the Kennedy assassination is

202
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:48,570
almost moot because there were up
to some really other wacky stuff.

203
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,940
Did the magic bullet
theory bother you at all?

204
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,020
I think if you talk,

205
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:56,280
and I have talked to people who
served in combat for a long time,

206
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:57,114
the story,

207
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,290
the buddy who gets around
through the front of his helmet,

208
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,740
it,

209
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,150
it travels around subcutaneously around
the skull and it enters out the back

210
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,260
without hurting the guy.

211
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:06,980
Uh,

212
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,970
is it everybody's got shit happens,

213
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,751
shit happens.

214
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:12,360
I am,

215
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,960
I am willing to believe
that magic bullet theory.

216
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,170
I would be willing to believe it except
for the fact that they came up with it

217
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,780
because the guy got hit with
a ricochet under the bridge.

218
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,120
And so they had to attribute
everything to three shots.

219
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:23,690
And I was like,

220
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:23,851
ah,

221
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,830
that she just seems like
fucking shifty lodge.

222
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,870
I Dunno what is what they're called.

223
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:29,870
But when you've eliminated
all the other suspects,

224
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,560
uh,

225
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:30,801
you know,

226
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:32,870
you were left with the likely truth,

227
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,410
I think.

228
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:33,811
And I,

229
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:34,041
I,

230
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,980
to my satisfaction and I've kind
of eliminated the other suspects.

231
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,601
Woody Harrelson,

232
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:39,520
his dad didn't have any part of it grass,

233
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,840
wasn't he like rumored to
be one of the shooters?

234
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,170
It's a,

235
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,550
I mean,

236
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,040
you know,

237
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,090
it wasn't that part of this,

238
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:46,190
of course Howard Hunt
was supposed to be there.

239
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,060
You know,

240
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,080
everybody's there.

241
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:48,914
You know,

242
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,230
Mcdonald's is there.

243
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,440
Why is that so sexy?

244
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,130
Walking unbelievable.

245
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,920
So badly foot,

246
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:55,491
loch ness,

247
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:56,001
monster,

248
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,620
Ua foes candidate,

249
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,473
the whole deal.

250
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,960
It's way more fun to think that
Lee Harvey Oswald was a Pantsuit,

251
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,441
but remember,

252
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,710
he was a really interesting guy.

253
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,210
If you,

254
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,360
I think the book that got
it close got it most right.

255
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,283
Uh,

256
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,520
was a work of fiction.

257
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:11,910
The Libra by Don Delillo lower,

258
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,130
it's really gets inside,

259
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:13,420
uh,

260
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,970
uh,

261
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,681
Oswald's head.

262
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:15,110
I mean,

263
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,400
Oswald was a guy who,

264
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,593
who,

265
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,650
uh,

266
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,170
his favorite show is a teenager was,

267
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,720
I led three lives about
an undercover FBI agent.

268
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,860
He was an intelligent,

269
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,560
he was a spy junkie in today's world.

270
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:30,610
He would have been a Gamer
and we're not a game.

271
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,550
He wanted to be.

272
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,030
He,

273
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,850
he was a guy who kind of wanted to,

274
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,730
to be,

275
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,450
uh,

276
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,120
to do big things and he tried very hard.

277
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:40,160
He wanted to be super secret KGB agent.

278
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:41,480
He wanted to be super secret,

279
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,020
you know,

280
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,950
wanting to be a marine.

281
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,410
He probably volunteered to
the FBI a couple of times.

282
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,720
He was just a guy who
wanted to do something big.

283
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,560
Um,

284
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,540
so I don't have a problem buying it.

285
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,860
So you had no problem with the
allegations of them fixing autopsy photos?

286
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:57,890
I have problems with all of it
cause I was lost in it for 10 years.

287
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:01,520
But the Kennedy family had
very good reason to ask for,

288
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,480
you know,

289
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,313
the brain.

290
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,080
I mean he had Addison's disease
and the implications of,

291
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:07,190
of Addison's disease,

292
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,090
uh,

293
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,671
towards the,

294
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:10,790
the Kennedy history were not favorable.

295
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,270
You know,

296
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,991
apparently,

297
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,441
I don't know.

298
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:16,760
But apparently it has been said that
he had multiple bouts of syphilis.

299
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:17,570
This is,

300
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:17,811
you know,

301
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:18,644
you don't want,

302
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,990
the family didn't want
to press and people,

303
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,670
they want this part of the record.

304
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,890
There was a lot of sense.

305
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:25,820
Syphilis Holla at your boy

306
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,910
that was worth it.

307
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,790
Amphetamines in large doses at that early.

308
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:32,780
It is point and who knows what.

309
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:33,700
He's really a,

310
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,611
he had a doctor,

311
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:35,840
Max Jacobson I believe,

312
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,130
I believe was the name.

313
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,220
He did have a doctor who would
shoot him with the vitamin.

314
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,020
I think B12 and amphetamine according
to one of the B12 mixed with speed.

315
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:47,450
That's how that do is not
uncommon at certain levels.

316
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:47,931
It was very,

317
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:48,321
you know,

318
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:51,890
a society thing to do back
then a five hour energy drink.

319
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,783
That's what it is.

320
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,170
The 12 and a lot of people
didn't even know there was,

321
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:56,130
he was the original doctor.

322
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:58,440
He was known as Dr Feelgood and
that's where the name came from.

323
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,730
Dr I believe it was
doctor Max Jacobson night.

324
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,710
I don't know.

325
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,460
Legendary.

326
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:02,910
Wow.

327
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,410
Sort of doctor to the stars back in
them Warhol and Kennedy's disease.

328
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:08,041
What did it happen?

329
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,330
It was at a motor skill thing.

330
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,560
What is it that I don't but,

331
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,060
but apparently there were up
there are in the symptoms,

332
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,560
the possible symptoms.

333
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:18,620
I think there can be emotional,

334
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,200
an emotional content to the disease,

335
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:24,570
so theoretically could
have affected his judgment.

336
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,171
It was,

337
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:26,100
it was unflattering.

338
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,080
I believe he was in a lot of,

339
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:28,590
this was the guide,

340
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,140
a lot of pain to supposedly,

341
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:31,381
right.

342
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:32,040
Yeah.

343
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,200
But back then you just didn't want
to talk about these things and,

344
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:34,710
and uh,

345
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,850
I think a lot of people,

346
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,630
uh,

347
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,630
ran around in circles covering things up
for their own reasons and in fact most

348
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:46,590
of them had really terrible things to
cover up that back then thing is really

349
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:47,820
fascinating when you think about it.

350
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,260
It's not that long ago I was,

351
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,100
I was alive.

352
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,530
I remember being sent home from
school when Kennedy was killed.

353
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,010
Kennedy was killed it.

354
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,863
Um,

355
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,061
but I,

356
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:56,760
I,

357
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,080
you know,

358
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,520
I go for the simple
explanation much of the time.

359
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,810
That's the good move.

360
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,973
Um,

361
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,880
I mean myself,

362
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,050
I keep the crazy open.

363
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,260
I opened the door for crazy
because I've seen some things.

364
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,220
I leave it open.

365
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,401
I,

366
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:08,771
but I,

367
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:09,570
I agree with you.

368
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,800
Most of the time I go with a simple door
with crop circles and Ufo shows in the

369
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:14,940
loch ness monster.

370
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:15,774
And Big Foot.

371
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,340
Most of the time I go for the simple door.

372
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:19,500
People are full of Shit
and that story socks,

373
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,760
that's how I usually go,

374
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,250
but I leave the door for crazy.

375
00:10:22,251 --> 00:10:22,590
Okay.

376
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,590
[inaudible]

377
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,570
cheer up fucking human being.
