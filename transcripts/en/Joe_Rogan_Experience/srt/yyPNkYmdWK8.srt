1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,720
We were telling stories
this week and about like,

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,790
like one time.

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:06,661
Okay,

5
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:07,380
one time,

6
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,780
one morning I thought I was,

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,980
my parents were out of town,

8
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,810
my little sister was 10,

9
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:15,780
I was probably 21 I was
drinking a lot at the time.

10
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:16,201
So it was,

11
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:16,441
you know,

12
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:16,711
party,

13
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:17,370
Animal Shit.

14
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,010
And then,

15
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,760
and I was pissing a lot of places
that like in the round houses,

16
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,990
like I pissed on my ex girlfriend's
dining room table and was walked in by her

17
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:25,560
dad.

18
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,660
Do you want to talk about
a fucking nightmare?

19
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,040
Oh my waiting,

20
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:29,370
waiting,

21
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:29,640
waiting,

22
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:29,880
waiting.

23
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,340
Were you passed on the dining room?

24
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,470
MEDOC her dad walked
in and caught her dad,

25
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,910
Larry Medoc in Orlando.

26
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:39,271
Larry,

27
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:39,781
if you're listening,

28
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:40,020
I,

29
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,910
I wa I'm guilty.

30
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,950
I so here's,

31
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:47,340
Oh yeah cause I never really
accepted blame for it.

32
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:51,180
I always said it never fucking happened
cause it cause I didn't want it to cause

33
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:51,990
I didn't want okay.

34
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,000
Why did you do it?

35
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:53,910
It was thanksgiving.

36
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,650
It was right after the rolling
stone magazine came out.

37
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:56,101
And so,

38
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:58,860
and I go back to party on what do you
mean the rolling Stone magazine with a

39
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:02,400
number of the rolling stone in 1997 called
me the number one party animal in the

40
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:03,790
country just for someone who's not,

41
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,650
doesn't know.

42
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,770
And then that was a big deal.

43
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:09,270
I became famous until I
became famous in like Tampa,

44
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:09,830
Florida,

45
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,351
Tampa,

46
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:10,861
Tallahassee,

47
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:11,341
Gainesville,

48
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,060
Orlando,

49
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,640
anywhere that I had people with
four went to Florida state lived.

50
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,210
I was,

51
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:15,960
they knew who I was.

52
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,350
They were like,

53
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,430
cause the fucking party guy.

54
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,960
So if I went out shots,

55
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,410
really we'd any do people
put drugs in my hand.

56
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:24,210
Like it was fucking insane.

57
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:24,931
I get roof feed,

58
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:25,381
I got roof.

59
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,100
He'd a couple of times.

60
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,510
So you became like a sort
of a celebrity partier.

61
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,900
I became the guy that I'd walk after the,

62
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:32,310
before the article I was just the loud,

63
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:33,000
fun,

64
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,830
shirtless guy on top of the bar,

65
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,300
getting everyone in a frenzy.

66
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,190
And then when the article came out,

67
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,460
it was like the fucking
lineman would come to the bar.

68
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:44,160
I drank at the [inaudible] and they'd
pull me aside and they're like,

69
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,090
you're drinking with us tonight.

70
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,560
We want to drink with a party animal.

71
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,740
And then I'd just be up with these lines
and like four lineman and we'd be just

72
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:52,740
doing shots and shots and shots
and these guys are 350 pounds,

73
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,720
two to 18 at the time,

74
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:58,140
probably like going through to 18
and probably more like two 25 but,

75
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:00,210
but and so I became like,

76
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,470
like I say famous,

77
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,720
I say like reality show famous like
the way Snookie her first season was,

78
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:07,470
you know,

79
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,680
so that's how you were in your
town and you're in low Tallahassee.

80
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,950
If I went any reg right after that
article came out in Tallahassee,

81
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:15,570
definitely in Orlando,

82
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:18,630
I knew 40% of the bar
knew who I was in Tampa.

83
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:21,850
Everyone knew who I was back when
people actually read magazines.

84
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:24,270
It's the rolling stone stuff
was crazy when that came out.

85
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:28,320
It was like being famous cut back to
how I pissed on my girlfriend's table.

86
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,910
So thank you.

87
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,940
So I that was like unwind and I was like,

88
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,590
that was like untangling a necklace.

89
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,250
So and so we go out in Orlando,

90
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,200
this is right after Thanksgiving
when everyone's home.

91
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,720
So everyone I know from
Orlando's at every bar,

92
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,850
all in like church street I
think is the name of the street.

93
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,890
So we go out and it's fucking chaos.

94
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:47,724
When my girlfriend,

95
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,860
her sister and her sister's boyfriend,

96
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:51,270
who was the coolest fucking guy,

97
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,460
and he'll always have weed.

98
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,740
So we go out and
everyone's buying me shots.

99
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,551
We're getting fucking hammered.

100
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,990
Her parents had just bought a house,

101
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,720
just bought brand new
house just like I ended.

102
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:02,740
It was their dream house.

103
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,730
We had Thanksgiving together.

104
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,720
We held hands,

105
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,220
talked about how at the table,

106
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,500
how this is everything we've
worked for guys as a team.

107
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,250
We saved,

108
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,083
we scrimped week.

109
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,953
Anyway,

110
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,420
we go back to her house and I'm like,

111
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:14,290
I'm not fucking done.

112
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,460
Like I want to keep drinking.

113
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,151
And this Guy Dan,

114
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:16,480
he's like,

115
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:16,721
oh yeah,

116
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:17,470
me too.

117
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,380
So we get like a 12 pack of beer and we
go out to the dock and d and that's all

118
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:21,190
I remember.

119
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,671
Danny.

120
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:25,520
Then the next morning we counts
everything to me because I might,

121
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,740
she walks in the first
thing in the morning,

122
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,510
did you piss on my dining room table?

123
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,051
And I'm like,

124
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:29,321
no.

125
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,220
Why would I fucking do that?

126
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,791
I'm a grown man.

127
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,630
I don't piss on tables.

128
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:32,080
You'd like,

129
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,500
my dad said he caught
you pissing on her table.

130
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:33,671
I'm like,

131
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,540
your dad is crazy.

132
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,910
He doesn't like me because I'm in the
party animal and he's trying to get me out

133
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:37,211
of your life.

134
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:39,190
That's what's fucking going on and
you can get out of the fucking room.

135
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,093
You got to believe me.

136
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,480
I'm the party animal.

137
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:41,831
I'm sure.

138
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:42,664
I'm sure.

139
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,320
I'm sure.

140
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,480
Sure

141
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,160
the fuck you're talking to right now.

142
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:50,300
He wants me out of your life.

143
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,300
Number one party animal,

144
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:51,830
the country,

145
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,663
but something to the,

146
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:52,851
yeah,

147
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:55,330
I'm sure I actually use the words so

148
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,990
you probably had a t
shirt of it explaining it.

149
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,351
Aw.

150
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:03,080
Did you ever think about getting on the
party animal tattooed anywhere in your

151
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:03,321
body?

152
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:05,530
I was thinking about getting a squirrel
with a beer can and a cigarette that

153
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,860
said the party squirrel on at one time.

154
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,501
Who's going to fuck it?

155
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,500
Question two.

156
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,260
So he told me what your 10 to about it.

157
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,680
I pulled you our world.

158
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,600
If I was a cop and I pulled you over
and you had a party squirreled Tatooine,

159
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:19,010
I immediately take you to jail.

160
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:19,611
I'm like,

161
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:22,700
I know this guy did something fucked
up in the last couple of months.

162
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,200
You've just got to get it out of them.

163
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,670
We just going to sit down and go,

164
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:26,391
you know what you did?

165
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,190
Just tell me you know what you did.

166
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:28,941
Just tell me.

167
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:30,220
We'll all get out of here early.

168
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:31,640
We'll get you a nice quick sentence.

169
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,330
Just tell me what happened so I don't
even know what you're talking about.

170
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,193
Okay,

171
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,340
so she get back in your fucking crazy.

172
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,410
She goes out to the breakfast
table where family is.

173
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,303
Oh my God.

174
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,430
How much piss were we talking
about here in my head?

175
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,720
It didn't happen in your head.

176
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:48,111
It didn't happen.

177
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:49,260
You didn't have blacked out.

178
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,113
Fucking,

179
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,811
I swear to you,

180
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:51,710
all my children right now,

181
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,670
I laid in that bed,

182
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,031
hold over,

183
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:53,301
and I went,

184
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:54,880
how fun then how do you,

185
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,551
how do you know your home?

186
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:56,750
He didn't fucking sell you down the river.

187
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:58,790
Maybe he pissed on the table
and then said that you did it.

188
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,170
That's why he woke you up in the morning.

189
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:03,200
He knew you blacked out and then you
blame you for pissing on the table.

190
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:04,280
That's what's going
through my head right now.

191
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:06,110
As I rolled back over and I go fuck them.

192
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:06,944
Maybe you will.

193
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,680
Maybe maybe that would be called shitting.

194
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:10,160
But yeah,

195
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,330
maybe we call it a Brian train wreck pong.

196
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,850
Are you smoking a regular
cigarette over there?

197
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,141
No,

198
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:17,974
it's got wheat in it.

199
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,300
Alright,

200
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,133
so,

201
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,880
so Danny,

202
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,350
then the boyfriend comes in and he
like comes in and his eyes are like so

203
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:27,184
excited.

204
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,790
He goes,

205
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,900
I heard you piss on their table.

206
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,131
And I'm like,

207
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:30,461
no,

208
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:31,660
why is everyone fucking saying that?

209
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:32,260
And he's like,

210
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,170
cause her dad walked in on your
pissing on the table and I said,

211
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,190
he's fucking mind.

212
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:36,700
He goes,

213
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,090
man,

214
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,400
he is pretty set in the,

215
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:41,950
he saw you pissing on
their dining room table.

216
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,521
And I go,

217
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:43,090
Danny,

218
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,380
I don't remember fucking anything.

219
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:45,100
He goes,

220
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,371
he goes,

221
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:46,300
well we got these beers,

222
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:47,150
we went out to their doc,

223
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:47,561
do remember that?

224
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:47,771
And I go,

225
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:48,510
yes.

226
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,091
And he was like,

227
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:49,691
and I had a joint.

228
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:50,000
And I go,

229
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,171
okay,

230
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:50,621
I remember that.

231
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:50,951
And he's like,

232
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:51,940
and then you ate the joint.

233
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:52,321
And I was like,

234
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:53,154
I don't remember that.

235
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,521
And he goes,

236
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:54,791
yeah,

237
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,181
I said,

238
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:56,560
hold this and you ate it.

239
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:57,394
And,

240
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,260
and then we killed all the
beers out there and I go,

241
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:00,711
fuck,

242
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:01,460
we did.

243
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:01,791
And he was like,

244
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:01,940
yeah.

245
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,830
And then you start piecing
back like little things.

246
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:04,280
I go,

247
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,200
did we get stuck in a
phone booth last night?

248
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,221
And he's like,

249
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:07,671
no,

250
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,610
we got locked in their
food cabinet like in their,

251
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,080
in their food closet,

252
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,460
like a pantry because in their,

253
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,160
because we were eating in their
kitchen and then this and this.

254
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:16,431
I start,

255
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:16,881
remember I go,

256
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:17,510
yeah.

257
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,070
So like the girlfriend come out,

258
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,930
the girlfriend's coming
and it was a sliding door.

259
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,930
So it was we,

260
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,570
we were eating and the
girlfriends came out,

261
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,410
the sisters and they go,

262
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,790
you're fucking making a ton of noise.

263
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,280
So me and Danny went into
the pantry and shut the door,

264
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:30,970
but then we couldn't figure out how to
open it cause there wasn't a handle.

265
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,300
You guys were hammered
and you cite a pantry.

266
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,570
They shoved you in the
Pantry to quiet you down.

267
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:38,510
We shoved ourselves into the pantry
so that we can continue eating.

268
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:38,811
We were like,

269
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:39,441
we're going to bed.

270
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:39,950
They left,

271
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,731
we went to the Pantry,

272
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:41,420
shut the door.

273
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,650
And then I remember sitting in the pantry.

274
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:46,160
I do remember this distinctly is us
being in the pantry thinking we are in a

275
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:46,670
phone booth,

276
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,350
laughing how hard all,

277
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:50,570
they had all this food in this
phone booth and we're like,

278
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,970
he believe this bull Moose
has fucking Doritos in it.

279
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,260
So then that's all I remember.

280
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,160
So then he says to me,

281
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,950
he goes them and he's really adamant.

282
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:02,720
So he leaves and I lay
back down and I'm like,

283
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,550
I can't believe I'm me
a frame for this shit.

284
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,690
All of a sudden I start,

285
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:08,451
do you ever have one of those?

286
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:08,760
We use,

287
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,620
remember the dream you had last night
and I distinctly remember seeing her dad

288
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:13,311
in his underwear.

289
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:14,144
In my dream.

290
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,290
I'm like,

291
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,531
wait,

292
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:17,510
I did have a dream about
her dad and his underwear.

293
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,343
That's odd.

294
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,423
And then I was like,

295
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,080
but he was in here yelling at me.

296
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,140
There's not a jury in yet.

297
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,300
She danced with an old man.

298
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:23,810
No,

299
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,141
he,

300
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:25,070
what happened was,

301
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:25,551
and this,

302
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:26,510
and then I start going,

303
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,261
oh shit,

304
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:28,340
this totally did happen.

305
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,170
I woke up in the middle of the night,

306
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,540
walked out to their dining room table,

307
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,350
erect and tried to go to the bathroom.

308
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,300
You know how you would kind
of try to lean it down.

309
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,750
So I must have been making a ton of
noise at their dining room table.

310
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,220
Pissed on their dining room table,

311
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,540
full blown pissed on their dining.

312
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,420
When you're telling me this now,

313
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,760
now I'm remembering.

314
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:47,120
I'm like,

315
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,781
Oh shit.

316
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:48,830
I fucking do remember.

317
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,940
You remember being erect?

318
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,650
I remember.

319
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:50,871
Yeah,

320
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,170
I remember.

321
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:51,830
I remember.

322
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,330
I just remember trying to pee.

323
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:54,080
You know how when you,

324
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,760
you have one of those nights
where you're like in the bathroom,

325
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:56,001
you're like,

326
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,250
I can't get to like lean forward.

327
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,870
So I'm leaning forward over
their dining room table,

328
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:00,680
trying to Piss,

329
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,640
making a ton of noise,

330
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:02,840
knocking everything off of it.

331
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,290
He comes out in his tighty whities I
remember that because she came back in and

332
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,250
I go to see your dad were tidy.

333
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:07,911
Whities and she goes,

334
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,211
he does,

335
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:08,721
why I don't want to,

336
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:09,554
nevermind.

337
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,720
I mean you can't dreamed I like,

338
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:12,461
no one wears off.

339
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:13,294
So anyway,

340
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,460
I dream about tighty whities twenties
let's say 26 25 so here's the worst part.

341
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:22,580
He yells at me and he goes,

342
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:23,720
where the fuck?

343
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,830
What the fuck are you doing?

344
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,310
And I said,

345
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,690
I'm going to bed.

346
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,793
And he said,

347
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,180
where's your bed?

348
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:30,680
And I pointed to the dining room table.

349
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,610
I go right here.

350
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:31,941
And he goes,

351
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:32,480
what?

352
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:32,751
So I,

353
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,370
David Blaine the tablecloth,

354
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,390
pull it,

355
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,440
lay on the bed,

356
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,010
on the,

357
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,150
on top of their table because the table,

358
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,770
you pissed him in my own business and my
own business in a Superman Cape full of

359
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:43,340
piss.

360
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,870
Just lit curtain myself over the neck,

361
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,360
go back to sleep,

362
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:51,290
and he gets me up and walks me into
my bed and puts me back in my bed.

363
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:51,800
And I'm like,

364
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,670
what a nice guy.

365
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,570
We,

366
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,460
it gets so with our
relationship was fucking doomed.

367
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,360
Like there was no,

368
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,201
I get up.

369
00:08:58,201 --> 00:08:59,190
That is a nice guy.

370
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:00,000
He's a really nice,

371
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,440
Larry Maddock is a saint because if that
happened to one of my daughters and my

372
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:04,800
house,

373
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,360
I would have beat the fucking kid's ass.

374
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,440
So I get off.

375
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,273
Would you really man?

376
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:08,790
No.

377
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,690
Do it like that again though.

378
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,520
I would beat the fucking kids.

379
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,373
Allison.

380
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,620
Passion in your voice.

381
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,850
Have you ever considered acting?

382
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:15,930
Maybe.
