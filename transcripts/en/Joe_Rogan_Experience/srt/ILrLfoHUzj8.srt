1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,940
Holy cow are recording.
Here we go.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,610
The Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,560
What's going on with
this fucking that's cool.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,150
You're both doing it.
No, I was silent. No,

5
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:16,620
we were by you or I'm going to
turn myself on. Where was I?

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,940
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,620
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,530

00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:30,531
you will save 15% off a
slimy pink jerk off device.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,550
And it's a good one. It's a
fabulous product. I've, okay.

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,540
Haven't used my yet. Use it. You
haven't used yet. That's ridiculous.

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,880
Let's make the music so it's official hit.

13
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:46,050
It doesn't feel like your podcast.
The blackout

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,210
[inaudible] Horace.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,800
When I hear that music, I don't
win. That's how it starts.

16
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:03,310
But smile on my face. Wild Times.
I could live in a wild times.

17
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:05,200
Let's get on our horses and just ride.

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,740
I guess what I want to say once Dan a
pro and I could survive not talking to

19
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:12,430
anybody. Damn right. All I need is
a match, a Bowie knife. And my Dick.

20
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,040
So he's that character that
Charles Bronson dude who
wants to live in the woods

21
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,230
by himself and doesn't bother
anybody with the government,

22
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:19,510
has to go out there and fuck with them
and he winds up killing everybody.

23
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,190
What is it that we might admire about that
guy who doesn't need the American way?

24
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:28,300
Self sufficiency? Man, I
don't need anybody but myself.
I'm self-reliant. Yeah,

25
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:30,430
but you know with a lot of
guys like the, the, the,

26
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,380
the loner would be kind of creepy,

27
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,560
but Charles Bronson had a way of
pulling it off that was admirable.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,720
Sure will do is nothing
Ted Kaczynski about him.

29
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,290
Charles Bronson was a bad ass and God
help you if you were a fan and tried to

30
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,370
come out to him.
I Ms. Guy.

31
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:47,371
I Know Adam West Batman told me a story
16 years ago about how Charles Bronson

32
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:51,610
was reading a book in a bookstore and
this guy comes in and goes, excuse me,

33
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,880
Mr Bryson, I'm a huge fan and
Charles Monster goes fuck off.

34
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,690
And it goes right back to his place.
Just like that guy was like, oh, okay.

35
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,200
It's hard to know how
much of that is the truth.

36
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,760
He was notorious full of shit.
He was notorious for being, uh,

37
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,010
just not the friend that he was a tough,
he was a real tough guy actually.

38
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,210
You know, when he did hard times, if
you'd never seen hard times. Youngsters,

39
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,950
youngsters, please. It's one of
the Goddamn all time classics.

40
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,510
It's a beautiful movie and
it's a, it's really like, uh,

41
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,250
the first like underground cage fighting
movie. They actually fun in a cage. Yup.

42
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,130
Bronson was in his fifties when he shot.
Was He in his 50s?

43
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,840
Because you see his body,
it's ridiculous.

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,680
You get a lot of native American in
him and I think he used to be like an

45
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:39,400
acrobat or something, something
along those lines. A circus I think.

46
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,990
Hey, we would with with Wikipedia
were just bullshit through this.

47
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,910
He was in the circus. Yeah. Yes. In
the circus. He did couple in Brazil.

48
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,380
In Brazil. He did couple. It's always
my favorite stuff when people go, no,

49
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,300
this guy, I know this guy. He
wasn't, it wasn't UFC dude.

50
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:58,060
He fought in the underground in Burma.

51
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,520
He has a confirmed

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,030
kills belt.

53
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,590
There was a lot of guys who just made
up a bunch of shit like that in the 70s

54
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:06,360
and the,

55
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,360
remember the the guy who they did the
movie kickbox well not kickboxing bloods

56
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:15,880
bloodsport yeah, frank ducks. Yeah. Yeah.
He's a Ninjitsu guy. Went out there,

57
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:17,860
there's a coma tain just
fucked everybody up.

58
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,580
Supposedly he had a story number
Dimock which was death touch.

59
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,520
There was a guy named Raphael Toria
and I've talked about this guy before

60
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,820
because this guy snuck through my
crazy radar and I realized that he was,

61
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,560
there was something wrong and then
it turned out he was a killer.

62
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,050
Like I didn't know I was around this guy.

63
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:38,880
He was a friend of a friend who was a
friend of Eddie's and I was around this

64
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:41,710
guy a couple of times and normally
my crazy radars are really good,

65
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,490
but this guy snuck right through it
and he was such a pathological liar.

66
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,280
This is one of the things that he did.
He was a fake black belt who,

67
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:53,140
one of the things he did was he had a
friend drive him to this spot and he said,

68
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm going into the woods.
You can't come any further.

69
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,220
I'm going to go to this [inaudible]
and I'll be back in two days.

70
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,870
So his friends drives them into the woods
and then he sees him like walk around

71
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:08,410
and like hide behind a tree and he
flipped the fuck is he doing right?

72
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,060
So he kind of hangs back to watch and the
dude starts walking back down the road

73
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:15,910
where he came from like, so the guy
drives off, right? Because like,

74
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:17,650
I dunno what the fuck is.
His deal was,

75
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,660
but he wanted to be dropped
off in the woods. He,

76
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:23,860
the guy comes back two days later
with a trophy. I kind of like,

77
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:27,820
he comes out of the woods. Well, he
has a story about, well, I had a fight,

78
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:32,060
50 men all bare knuckle. Some guys
chose to have glass on their hand.

79
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:35,970
Some guys not just had just crazy nutty.
Meanwhile,

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,770
feigning while his prompts
finding stories. Guy Fuck fest,

81
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,820
I got to put this handkerchief in
my pants. Don't worry about it.

82
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:45,790
It's just a signal. It was nothing.
There was no, nothing happened.

83
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:49,210
He made up the whole thing. There was no
Kuma Tej out there and he just came off.

84
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,990
He just went, yeah, it's same thing.

85
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:56,530
I had the guy in a headlock that I fucked
him while he wound up killing a guy by

86
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,920
choking him to death. Oh really? Yeah.
That's the stories that this guy,

87
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:03,580
he was just as crazy pathological liar
and he wound up hooking up with this girl

88
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:07,690
and the girl was married and he choked
her husband to death. Oh Nice guy.

89
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,540
In real life when you choke
somebody to death and stiff,

90
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,520
like just choking him like Jujitsu style,

91
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,370
you have to like continue the choke
on when they're already passed out.

92
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,490
Just hold it.
Cause like in the movies it's like Ah.

93
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:21,700
And then they pass out and they're like,
ah, he's dead. You know. But in real life,

94
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,420
some people would die from
it and glorious bastards.

95
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:29,400
When he choked her with his hands. That's
really hard to do. Really hard to do.

96
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,340
Even put a guy out by choking
him was, you know, it hurts,

97
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,280
but it's all a matter of how much
you can tolerate. You know, it's the,

98
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,830
it's cuts your breathing off
cause it's crushes your windpipe.

99
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,210
If the guy's got good thumbs,

100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,830
but it probably won't put you
unconscious tars tars so you can do it.

101
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,860
It's not something I practice,
but some guys will tap to that like,

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,470
like it kickboxers when we
first started fighting and MMA,

103
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,920
they tapped to like forearms across
the neck. Like a guy will just stack,

104
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,810
I'm going to get a form on their neck
and they just can't deal with it.

105
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,480
I don't know how to react to it.
Yeah, I've seen it a few times.

106
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:01,490
Like high level kickbox
just like Tom Erickson,

107
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,220
I think Tom Erickson did actually
tap a guy with a rape joke.

108
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,220
He actually grabbed his neck like this.
Wow. What we would call the rape choke.

109
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,770
Wow. Yeah. And he tapped the
guy in humanly strong hands.

110
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,170
So Tom Erickson was 300 pounds.
That American wrestler gorilla,

111
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,070
you're going to tap.

112
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,010
There's one point in time
when Tom Erickson was the
scariest guy in the planet

113
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,420
and he kind of missed both boats as far
as like fame and a lot of people don't

114
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:24,770
know about Erickson because of that.

115
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,600
But if you go back to
like when Erickson fought,

116
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,600
fought Kevin random and it smashed
him and knocked him unconscious,

117
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,810
he was fucking like really close to 300
pounds corn fed because one of those big

118
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:39,110
crazy white boys just in a powerful
wrestler. Just a real good rest.

119
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,100
I'd love to have a rape joke strength
with other guys. Just grab a guy, go,

120
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,110
you're going out with Ericsson.
We got,

121
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,460
he was getting famous right at the time
where the UFC was falling apart and so

122
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:52,880
he went to fight over in Japan
and he just never really,

123
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,920
it just his, the peak of his
athletic talent and the peak of his,

124
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,200
his uh, possibilities. They
didn't collide together correctly.

125
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,720
Thanks. I was thinking about
it, it's like just for MMA,

126
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,350
like if you're a tennis players,
have MMA seems to be to stay on top,

127
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,510
but what the way say Anderson Silva or
GSP has is so extraordinarily difficult

128
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:16,020
because there are so many good guys now
coming up and more importantly it looks

129
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:19,560
to me like a lot of these guys are
really learning how to box cause they're

130
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:20,850
coming out of boxing gyms.

131
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,090
When you learn how to box and you can
punch now instead of like punching like a

132
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,280
wrestler, they're punching like
boxers. When you don't have gloves,

133
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,560
you make one mistake.
You're going to sleep

134
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,850
guy Fabio Maldonado that's been fighting
out of Brazil and he just fought

135
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,370
recently and this fucking kid is,

136
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,440
he's got nasty hands dude and eat for
Kyle Kingsbury who's like a serious

137
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:41,891
athlete,

138
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:45,730
two Oh five and Kyle Kingsborough was
grabbing in the Meu Thai clinch and he was

139
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:49,570
just ripping hooks to his body and
Kingsbury had to let it go, which is rare.

140
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,030
Most of the times when a guy gets you
into noise and I clench and he punches

141
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:52,930
body,
that guys can take it.

142
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,900
But he turns his punches over so
good and he's so loose with them.

143
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:59,680
They just buy it by him. Like there,
there were just vicious body punches.

144
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:02,530
You see the difference between
a guy who could really punch.

145
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,210
Like if you got a guy like Manny Pacquiao
and you gave him those little gloves

146
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,860
getting, let me tell you something, man.

147
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:12,070
If you don't take Manny Pacquiao down
the first five 10 seconds, that fight

148
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,350
back of Ricky Hatton headwind and what
that Hook, oh, I thought he was dead too.

149
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,000
I've never been like, oh
my God, he got shut off.

150
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,950
The thing about Pacbio is he's a
little guy. He's only 140 750 pounds,

151
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:31,230
but he hits fucking hard for
a little guy. Dude, I've,

152
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,310
I've watched him physically hit the pants.

153
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,240
Freddie Roach was holding pads for him.
I watched it and dude, first of all,

154
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,120
the punches come so fast
and all of them are hard.

155
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:45,330
It's not so like maybe like there's a
guy who could punch 40% harder than,

156
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,990
but he might only hit you once. Pat Cow's
going to hit you 18 fucking that time.

157
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,180
I think a lot of guys can't
train for that kind of speed.

158
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,700
You can get your sparring partners,

159
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,220
you can't like when I watched
what he did to Margarito who

160
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,730
is a bigger guy and has been towards
and has actually never been hurt.

161
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,090
Margarita is a rough,
when he got hurt by Mosley before that,

162
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,380
but he still psychologically fuck cause
they caught him with a plaster and his

163
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:11,190
gloves and we made them fight anyway.
That's crazy shit.

164
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,530
He knew he was going to be
suspended and he's going to be

165
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,010
such an assassin and to see Manny pat
can take a bigger man like that and do

166
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:22,110
whatever. He was a monster.
Packy I was one of the,

167
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:26,250
if not the greatest of all
time, top two. I mean I think,

168
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,150
I think I would think he's number one
just to, and people will argue with it,

169
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:33,330
but God dammit, he's won world titles
in eight different weight classes.

170
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,710
Who the fuck has every done that? I would
love to have seen him fight. Um, Duran.

171
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,480
Yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God.
Duran at one 47 the Duran,

172
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,231
that beach sugar ray.

173
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:45,750
And the first fine crazy and that
really wasn't as best weight class.

174
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,730
Darren's best way class.

175
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:49,980
It was one 35 one 35 was one of the
greatest lightweight of all time.

176
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,560
If you watch like it's fight with
Ken Buchanan when he won the title,

177
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:55,660
he was fucking vicious. Panama's
street kid. Unbelievable.

178
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,540
Just the animal man was a born fighter.

179
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,270
You see what these documentaries on
that guy and it's like a pit bull.

180
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:03,720
It's like a gain bred dog,
like a guy to interview him space.

181
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,990
Then when to interview him in Panama when
he was a kid, when he was a contender,

182
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,210
when he was coming up and they're
following them in the streets,

183
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,290
asking them about boxing.

184
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,390
Where'd you learn at a box and
in front of these reporters,

185
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:17,370
he grabs a cat by the tail and throws
it into a brick wall. Oh my God. Yeah,

186
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,650
in front of them. You know,
he, I remember when they,

187
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,910
there was an old interview and you could
probably youtube it where he's being

188
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:25,290
asked by like Brent Musburger,

189
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,220
someone about his fight with Macho Hector
Macho Comacho he hits some fight with

190
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:31,140
you. No, it was later
on in his career. And,

191
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,240
and you'd hear him say some
stuff and like Spanish,

192
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:37,020
but I didn't know that was one of
them might have corn and, and uh,

193
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,870
well I uh, then there's the interpreter
say, um, cause it, cause Brenmar hospital.

194
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,950
What do you feel that you're, you're
fighting an outside, it's going to be hot.

195
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:46,940
Is the heat going to affect you or do you
think you're used to that? You know, uh,

196
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:50,990
against someone like macho
who moves around so much in
a ring light, he goes, hey,

197
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,870
just go ahead and just put it on. And
medical. Then, uh, he's referring to, uh,

198
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,830
Mr. Camacho is a homosexual
and so, so much. Yeah.

199
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,380
So Martin [inaudible],
I'd be like, well yeah,

200
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,430
but don't you think that you're fighting
now with 10 ounce glass wasn't 12 ounce

201
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,920
gloves now and you, you are a harder
hit her. I'm a lot of people saying,

202
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:09,930
do you think that's going to favor
unified? You going to go to the body,

203
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:13,040
you think more than the
chin, Mitochondria, tenor.

204
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,700
And he's still a referring to Mr. Watson.

205
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:22,950
I'm a sexual and, and if I think it
the third time I'm, or whoever it was,

206
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:26,780
Ms. Berger and he's like, uh, he's,
he's still calling him a homosexual man.

207
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,250
That's a Roberto Duran. I guess we're
not going to get anything out of him.

208
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,120
You know, he was impossible man. He
was just like, dude, I think fighter.

209
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,610
Well it also, you mean he
grew up in Panama? Man,

210
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,250
I think if you grow up in a tough country,
you know,

211
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:41,730
you grow up in a spotlight that you grew
up poor Noriega and they say Noriega

212
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:43,650
and he were friends.
Like Noriega liked him a lot.

213
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:46,260
Like when they have more on everybody,
Roberto Duran,

214
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,160
you can't not love a true fighter. He's
a true fighter representing your country.

215
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,380
They had other guys you say be a
Pedroza wasn't here from Panama as well.

216
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,280
I think he was

217
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,140
Cuba. I don't really know.
I don't remember. I thought
he was from Panama but,

218
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,200
but Duran was one of my favorite fighters
of all time and the guy couldn't even

219
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,830
speak English. It didn't matter.
He just was such a savage.

220
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:07,150
She's going to be interesting to see like
guys like Nick Diaz are coming out of

221
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:10,570
Andre Ward's camp and stuff and these
guys who are really studying boxing and

222
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:13,700
even though it it, you have to know
everything and they may wish to.

223
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:16,720
What I love about it [inaudible] you are
going to get some guys who are going to

224
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:21,050
become, you know,
incredible boxers and the,

225
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,360
I think that the,

226
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,590
it's going to be an issue about you're
going to have fights that last that,

227
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:26,170
that are not,

228
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,610
you can't have very good punchers you
can't slip when you don't have gloves.

229
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,010
When guys can punch that hard.
I think it's going to,

230
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:34,520
something's going to
have to give them that.

231
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,780
You guys are going to get
mine as many mistakes. Yeah.

232
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:39,340
I mean Cain Valasquez is great,
right? We know how great he is now.

233
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,640
He has to fight jr Santos
and Santos can hit.

234
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:46,150
So somebody's going to catch somebody
in that fight and it doesn't necessarily

235
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:47,110
mean it's the better fighter.

236
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:50,650
It might mean that you just got caught
or your game plan was a little too hasty.

237
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,820
You gotta be very careful. You saw the
check Congo Pat Barry fight. Yes I did.

238
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:57,490
Which is the craziest NZ
in any fight ever. I mean,

239
00:12:57,491 --> 00:13:00,940
that's a perfect example of why you have
to be so careful in MMA. It's unbelief.

240
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,380
And Pat Barry is explosive. Oh
my God. And he went after a man,

241
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,200
he decided that he was getting criticized
for his fights and he was kind of

242
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:11,740
boring. And people were
saying, he doesn't, you know,
take enough chances. Well,

243
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,130
he showed why he doesn't
take enough chances because
look, when you take chances,

244
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:17,500
you can get knocked the fuck out.
And he was a fun, it was a fight.

245
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,830
He was winning easily.
If he just fought at a discipline pace,

246
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,640
that probably would have never happened.
And that's experience. Yes. Experience.

247
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:28,000
But it's also, he chose to fight
in an exciting style on purpose.

248
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:32,410
He wanted to throw caution to the wind
and just go, you know, kill or die,

249
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,590
kill or be killed. And I
think he, uh, he did that.

250
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,790
He did exactly what he wanted to do, but
some guys never do that. And by the way,

251
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,800
Shit, Congo, taking those shots. God
Damn. I've never seen a body like that.

252
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:48,580
It's the most ridiculous
thing. So Superhero former
here. Yeah, he's a superhero.

253
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,930
He's a, he's a extreme mesomorph
that's what that guy is. He's good.

254
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,610
He's just super muscular, like
perfect athletic frame. You know,

255
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,840
he's not the best heavyweight athlete
though, which is weird. I mean it,

256
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,280
Cain Velasquez is a way
better heavyweight athlete,

257
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,380
which is weird cause if you
saw the two of them together,

258
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,890
I mean the average person looks at check
Congo and Cain Velasquez and you'll get

259
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,130
the fuck out of here. That black guy's
going to kill him. That's isn't that,

260
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:13,180
that's like wrestling.
Like you know,

261
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:15,970
you gotta you gotta like you roll in
Jujitsu and some guy comes in and he's got

262
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:18,010
this beautiful body and somebody he can,

263
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:20,890
you can move and manipulate and then a
guy shows up and he looks like a plumber

264
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,970
with a bit of a belly and he's
just like immovable. He's, yeah,

265
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,840
I think it's how your body is balanced.

266
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:29,260
That Congo is always dangerous to anybody
because he's got some pop in those

267
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:32,440
hands. Dude, he was the only guy to
really saw hurt her. ASCA is too,

268
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,521
he's tough as shit.

269
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:36,160
He went three full rounds with Cain and
Cain beat the fuck out of him in that

270
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:37,360
fight.
You know he's,

271
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:40,840
he's obviously durable cause Congo
caught him with some big punches.

272
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,820
Mere put them to sleep, but mere
got him in a guillotine. Mirrors.

273
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,660
Ganti it's nasty.
He and he did it so perfect.

274
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:49,240
If you watched the way he locked it up,
he's cinches it up.

275
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:52,550
He blocks off the neck with his arm
and squeeze squeezing with his right.

276
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:57,080
It's like it was, yeah. Mirror is one
of those guys, man, if he catches you,

277
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:00,950
especially in the early part of the fight
where he's not even a little bit tired

278
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,730
and you give up an arm or or,

279
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,380
or a choke or something like that and
he's going to break your neck, man,

280
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,130
you're off. I can't wait to
see my boy, man Miller, who
is my become a good friend.

281
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:12,230
I just love that guy.
I want to see him fight Michael Bisping.

282
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,860
It's going to be great, man. I just love
watching him. I love his whole attitude.

283
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:19,130
I love it. He never stops
moving. I will never stop moving.

284
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,930
I wish that people could
see what what he did.

285
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:23,210
But I was in Vegas and we were laughing
and talking and he kept moving around

286
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:25,310
and we're joking around.
And then finally he got so excited,

287
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:28,490
he w he walked out in the hallway anyway,
nobody was watching.

288
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:31,340
He'd just kind of punched the air and
ran down the hallway for no reason.

289
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,230
I was like,

290
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,070
he just spazzed out in the hallway and
got so excited and he came back in there.

291
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,090
Well, he knows he's got some extra energy.
He's got to get rid of it. Smart Guy,

292
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:43,570
by the way.
He's supposed to be doing what he's doing.

293
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,750
You know what's crazy is you can look
at him and see like that guy. Like,

294
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:49,660
I'm not going to fight that guy. That
guy's scary. But like last night, uh,

295
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:53,620
Jake was in the audience at one of your
shows. Oh, what's his name? Jake, right.

296
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,340
Jake Ellenberger. Yeah. Yeah. And
he sat in my seat and I'm like,

297
00:15:57,341 --> 00:15:58,570
who's this guy sitting in my seat?

298
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:01,390
And I'm walking up and I like look at
his ears. I'm like, I'm Outta here.

299
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,140
Jake. Jake was there when
I was, Jake was there with,

300
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,170
he came to my show in Vegas with a,
with mayhem and yeah,

301
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,380
he's just got a fire
hydrant on his shoulders.

302
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,150
He took like clay and they chip.

303
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,260
They were a bad scope or they chipped
out like you know his head. Nah,

304
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:23,360
this is good enough. That dude's
a tank and he's a scary as fuck.

305
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,080
He's going to fight Jake shields.
That's going to be a very interesting,

306
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,230
he's very good. He's a very good
striker and she is prescribed, oh,

307
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,030
he's a lot better stroke then shields.

308
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:36,500
But shields has got some wicked
takedowns and some of his top Jujitsu.

309
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,690
Lucky if he gets on top of
you. Ooh, you're fucked.

310
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,430
Jake shields is one of
the best in the world at,

311
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:46,250
at finishing guys in MMA and Jujitsu.
Jujitsu is like real simple.

312
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:49,370
Like he's always used Nogi.
He's not not a gay guy.

313
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:52,730
So he doesn't have any key habits at all.
And he like, if he gets on top of you,

314
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:53,564
he's a wrestler.

315
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,890
So he's got awesome positioning control
and he's strong as fuck and he'll

316
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,490
squeeze off arm triangles on
you all day if he catches you.

317
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,570
If Jake shields gets on top of you
and he gets you in a bad position,

318
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,880
you're fucked man. Cause it's
like a level, it's a really high,

319
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:09,980
high level of Jujitsu
that that guy breaks.

320
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,900
If he gets you in a checkmate position,

321
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,860
the odds are that you're going
to squirm out of it. Like look,

322
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:17,020
he got Paul Daley and
elite Xc and elite XC.

323
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,660
They were fucking him by the fight goes
to the ground for more than 15 seconds.

324
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:24,500
They stand you up, like literally
told the referee. So stand fights up.

325
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,670
Even if they're active.

326
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,720
Like Roy Nelson got stood up when he
was in fucking side control working on a

327
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:33,590
Kamora and Andre Arlovski and they stood
him up. It was completely ridiculous.

328
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,590
Well Jake Shields Jujitsu was so tight.
He caught Paul daily with an arm bar.

329
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,010
Even under those rules, he
doesn't need much time. Dude.

330
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,060
He gets a guy like daily on the ground.
It's like, give me that pitch crazy.

331
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,080
He's just, it's just that
high level stuff, but he's
got to get it to the ground.

332
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,220
That's where Ellenberger

333
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,300
you can, if you can defend a take
down, that's a huge part of it.

334
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,820
Ellenberger moves good on his feet too.
That's the other thing. He's not a duty.

335
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,280
Just stands there like a robot.

336
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,580
Like there's some guys who just kind
of weighed in. He moves, he moves on.

337
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,760
It's feet and lose on is tough. That's a
tough fight. That's an excellent fight.

338
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:08,550
What's your calling the Biz Bang
Miller fight. Fucking I want,

339
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:11,670
can't wait to see the series because the
series is going to be hilarious cause

340
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:14,970
mayhem is never going to stop fucking
with them and I've already heard some shit

341
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:18,570
that's gone down. I can't divulge any
information to give you any previews,

342
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:23,070
but there's already been some crazy shit
going down and mayhem is having a blast.

343
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,690
He's a true hands. Like I'm around comics
all the time. That dude's hilarious.

344
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:32,370
Yeah, I mean he's a true
personality. He's, he's got
bigger than life personality.

345
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:35,580
He's so entertaining. Like, I love hanging
out with the guy because he's just,

346
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,220
it's just always fun.
He just want to get some insight into him.

347
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:42,930
Read his articles. He's smart. Yeah. He's
a good writer, man. He's a good writer.

348
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:45,960
No doubt. He's a really smart guy.
He's not, you know, you think,

349
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:50,400
are you looking at him? He's got
dyed hair. He's like, yeah, smart.

350
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,071
Very smart.

351
00:18:51,071 --> 00:18:55,950
He's got a great take on things and a
very thought out take on things and if you

352
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:58,500
read his blogs like he works,
he's very proud of them.

353
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:02,100
He's a very good writer
and he could fucking easily
write a book and it would be

354
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:05,220
a great book because he said there's
a guy who's lived some crazy shit.

355
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:08,070
My buddy and my buddy Anthony
Tampax was a novelist who actually,

356
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:10,530
it was talking to him about his novel. He
would, he said, you should write a book,

357
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:12,890
and I think, I think he's going to call
it total mayhem or something like that.

358
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,510
This is great. Yeah. Why not
just tell his story, man.

359
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:19,680
These fucking stories of getting in
fights with his dad and she's growing up,

360
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:21,990
getting in fights on his blog. I
said, the first time I met him,

361
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:23,850
I were in Vegas and I walked
in and I said, dude, you know,

362
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:27,960
I've got to just be honest in a tee shirt.
You don't look that tough. I, you know,

363
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,400
he,
I mean besides the nose and the ears,

364
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,700
but you look at his back and he's a big
oven. It's Kinda lanky. I mean, if you,

365
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:35,100
if he said, I'm a, I'm a tennis
pro, I'd be like, that makes sense.

366
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:37,440
You're a tennis pro. You're
not, he doesn't look like
an MMA fight. It's not like,

367
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:40,260
uh, like, like Jake, you look in his
ears and his neck. You're like, wow.

368
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,280
But may him from behind

369
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,700
somewhat slender gig conversation. Yeah,
exactly. This is how it's done. I am,

370
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:50,270
I've been listening to you guys like
as if you guys were all gay guys,

371
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:54,800
like talking about other guys so much
louder than the steam and the steam of the

372
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:55,221
shower.

373
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:58,960
What I'm trying to say is that he tends
to just the way the water rivulets his

374
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,680
body was holding me down. I came here
and leave your butt fucking is so weird.

375
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:05,230
Can't believe you've got
that kind of top game.

376
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,060
Just don't smile at me cause then it
makes it really gay for the last five

377
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:10,400
minutes. I've been thinking about
that and you're like, you know,

378
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:13,010
like you said beautiful body.
You said you should see his,

379
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,270
if he gets a hold of you on
top, you know, you're like,

380
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,680
you just replay the whole thing.

381
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:21,470
What you're saying and act like you
were talking about other gay guys like

382
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:24,170
Gossiping. It's one of the
funniest things though. So

383
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,280
a psychiatrist have a field
day. First of all, you know,

384
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:32,450
it also charges to have a field day.
Talking about Jujitsu, it's two guys.

385
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,960
Two guys in their forties yeah.
Two guys in their forties passion.

386
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,540
I'm talking about fighting. One
guy has a very, very manly beer.

387
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,470
The other one is shaved his off and he's
got a backwards baseball hat and he's

388
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:47,090
pushing 50 cut to us an hour one.
No shirts, no shirts. I'm hot,

389
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,160
not going to wear these pants.

390
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,120
I got this new lotion I'm using. If
it's the right choice. Let me see.

391
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:56,090
How does it feel like flowers go man.
You feel as slippery as a sly.

392
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,810
Finally found the steep rate
of listening to MMA talk.

393
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,420
Now I will not have eyes
glazed over anymore.

394
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:03,450
I'll be giggling like a
mother fucker attendance.

395
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,490
Talking about gay sex cuts me
wearing a Bandanna for no reason.

396
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,220
A lot of people don't still don't
know that Brian was the one.

397
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,690
I had a thing called getting pumped that
a Howard stern used to play a bunch of

398
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:15,190
times.
It was on my first CD.

399
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,790
I'm going to be dead someday and it's me
and this other dude working out in the

400
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:23,460
basement and it's me and Brian and uh,
it was fuck that was to that.

401
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,420
I'm Kelly, Kirsten and Kelly
Curtis and played my mom.

402
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,680
I remember when we lay that down. Yeah,
that was fun, Dude. That was very fun.

403
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:30,281
Anyway,

404
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:33,430
if you ever meet may him asking him to
tell you the story about when he was in

405
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:36,880
Florida and he ended up in Jane,
like six guys.

406
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,330
He was dancing with a girl and guys
like you trying to disrespect me.

407
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:43,290
He was like, Nah, I'm not
disrespecting Dan. Dan A guy's eye.

408
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,480
He throws a punch and my based
on goes with an elbow knocks man.

409
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,440
I gotta get Outta here. He goes out there
and like six guys come on. He's like, Oh,

410
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:53,650
here goes, they had no idea
what they were getting into.

411
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,130
It's like I was just like a bunch of,
you know,

412
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,650
coyotes coming in on a pit
bull or something and like,
oh, it's gotta be like,

413
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:04,570
knock you out dad. I, there was a bot pile
of bodies around him. Wow. Yeah. I mean,

414
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:05,860
you want to fight him.
You're not a pro.

415
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,380
Just throwing a couple punches in your
life. It took some karate in high school.

416
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,010
Go have fun, have fun with me and Miller.
Well, this what people don't understand.

417
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:14,920
The difference between a professional
fighter on a regular human being is this

418
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:18,820
is something that doing every day,
all day for hours.

419
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,410
And Man doesn't take time off.

420
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:23,740
He doesn't get fat if mayhem doesn't have
a fight going on, he's still training.

421
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:26,290
He's still doing, Jujitsu is still doing
his boxing. He's still doing everything.

422
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,850
[inaudible] it was literally like trying
to have an argument with a guy and all

423
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,730
you have is a book on the
language and he's fluent in it.

424
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,370
[inaudible] just going to tell you
what not. That's exactly what it is.

425
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,770
But it's like, it's like fighting
is like a language, you know,

426
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:41,170
and everybody there you go to Fulcan
homemaker, bro. And he told you something,

427
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,670
you don't really actually like coming
because he's going to kick your knees out

428
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:46,830
from you and get along.

429
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,600
Just don't laugh and then you're gonna
realize he doesn't get tired because he's

430
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,130
fucking doing it for six hours a day.

431
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,450
I remember getting drunk with Eve Edwards
and, and, and, and, and Nate Marquardt.

432
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:58,050
We were, we were in a, we were
shooting this, um, this, uh,

433
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,090
movie in Pittsburgh and he started
just, this is warrior, right?

434
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:05,260
This comes out in September and, uh,
and it's been testing through the roof.

435
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:08,290
This is what you play me, I play you.
I remember I called you and I said,

436
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:11,200
I'm playing you in a movie. I called
you. I go, I'm planning in a movie.

437
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:12,250
Can you give me some advice?
He goes,

438
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:15,160
I just tried to take myself completely
out of the equation and that really

439
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:17,950
helped. I just would call the fights,
but they wrote some funny stuff from me.

440
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:22,130
I'm a, I'm a smart ass, you know, in the
movie. Nice. Nice. But I'm a rolling,

441
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,710
what's your name in the
movie, Brian? It really,

442
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:32,920
well, I don't know why more actors
just don't do the way I got the parts.

443
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:35,470
I put the, I put the writer
and the director together.

444
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,530
Imagine that Tom Hanks as stars,

445
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:42,790
as Tom Hanks do that Danny
Devito is Danny Devito.

446
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,400
A short twin of Arnold Schwartzenegger

447
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,740
played by Arnold Swartz.

448
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,700
And do you think Swardson nigger
is ever going to bounce back?

449
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,730
Do you think anybody will
ever take you guys seriously?

450
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,350
I don't think so.

451
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,030
Mainly because it depends
on how he reacts to it,

452
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:05,180
but if you're older now, first of all,
nobody wants to see him as an action hero.

453
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,460
Number two, you know, look, I understand
infidelity. I can understand as a man,

454
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:15,020
you f you may stray. Let's
all be respectful. Let's
all be forgiving, et Cetera.

455
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:17,150
Okay, I've net, not that I've
ever had thoughts like that,

456
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:20,450
but the point is that if you're going
to fund the housekeeper, here's it.

457
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:23,570
Just first of all, that's outrageous,
but let shit, I'll give it to you.

458
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,770
I don't know.
Maybe she had big tests.

459
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:27,590
She was off you and she smelled like
something. You were born. I get it.

460
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,410
You're the king of the world.
How about pulling up or we're in a condom?

461
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,660
I don't know.
How about not giving her a baby?

462
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,150
Think the whole thing is the wild thing.

463
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,270
The whole thing of doing it is you're
not even supposed to be doing this and

464
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:40,780
she's soaking your raw car.

465
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:44,730
Can you just look at that fucking
housekeeper pussies? This is my house.

466
00:24:44,731 --> 00:24:49,650
I fucking everybody in my house. I
just think about it. And you did.

467
00:24:49,651 --> 00:24:51,410
Should I pull out Gonan doesn't bluff.

468
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,840
It's shoot a load in the were like
Kona and shit. Easy. When you're, when,

469
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,000
when you're the king of the world, why
not? He's the king of his world, man.

470
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,430
The guy's living in this
$20 million mansion.

471
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,310
Apparently right after this happened,

472
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,880
they put the house up for sale
and it wasn't, he didn't know it.

473
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,530
He sold it to someone else.

474
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,680
But this is the house where all the
affairs took place and he sold it to like

475
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:15,300
some professional golfer
or something like that.

476
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,450
And that guy put it up right away and
he might've put it up right away because

477
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:19,710
people started hassling him

478
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,690
extension drive through

479
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,190
and fidelity, this is

480
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,130
echoing in the walls,
like a mass murderer building.

481
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,890
That building's haunted with him coming,
uh, coming all the time, calming.

482
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,550
Uh, and he fucked her for 10 years,
man. He did. He was fucking her for 10.

483
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:50,220
You were so excited. Oh,
I thought, oh no, no, no.

484
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,820
God, no, no. He was, he
was banging her in the bed.

485
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:56,760
He was how raised tagging her in the
bathroom. He was banging her every,

486
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:59,730
once you think of it as a tool
for masturbation type thing,

487
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,620
like she was just like a fleshlight.
Amen. What are you talking about dude?

488
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:08,470
That's a human being. Yeah, but it's
also her, his main kind of things.

489
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,440
He has a face.

490
00:26:10,441 --> 00:26:14,930
It looks a little bit like mayhem millers
and I'm not attracted to that, but uh,

491
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,470
I guess he is. She was a big I, who knows
what she looked like when she was young.

492
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,350
I think he could make a comeback if he
doesn't maybe like cop land and whenever

493
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:22,220
you're ready.
What she looks like.

494
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,710
I don't mean to make fun of the
Mexican female version of Krs one.

495
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,630
Listen, she has a daughter.
That's all. She's a pretty
lady. That's what I'm saying.

496
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,110
I'm a big scare.
One Fan.

497
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,900
That's it sounded the police
look good for her man, but she,

498
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:40,790
she was doing what she was. No woman can
say no to our scores girl that told me.

499
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,980
Huh?
Do you ever see

500
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,820
cop land now?

501
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,810
Like that was kind of a weird movie for
Sylvester Stallone where it was kind of

502
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:50,880
like you played a little chubby
fat. Yeah. I think if he,

503
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:53,970
if Arnold does a movie like that where
he plays a character that's like kind of

504
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:57,030
like down on his luck coming back,
you know, kind of like a dirty cop

505
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,200
or something like that.
I want to see a good actor do that.

506
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:02,950
I don't know how good an actor he,
is it true?

507
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,710
Don't go to the movies
to see dramatic gut,

508
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,820
but you also thought that it festers
Stallone when he no, no, no, no,

509
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:11,160
because semesters told
him. Did Rocky. Yeah. Okay.

510
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:14,250
You got to remember he did
some shitty ass Middle East,

511
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:19,251
but Sylvester Stallone did fucking rocky
road and it's one of the best movies

512
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,580
hung in there because they wanted
to give that movie to someone else.

513
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,310
They wanted to give that movie to
some other stars and he said, no,

514
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,070
this is my movie.
And when he wrote this and did this,

515
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,110
and in the end of the movie,
he doesn't even when,

516
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,420
that's what a lot of people don't
even realize he loses in that movie.

517
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,540
It was inspired by a losing
performance by Chuck Wepner,

518
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,900
with Chuck Wepner Flop Muhammad Ali.
So he wrote all this shit out.

519
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,100
It did it all himself and acting,
it's fucking asshole.

520
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,220
He became a goof kind of later. And I
love him. I mean, when I say a Goof,

521
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:51,450
I'm saying a guy who does these big crazy
cartoonish movies and forget how great

522
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:54,210
those moments where when you were a
young man and I saw first blood. Yeah.

523
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:56,420
That's one of the best movies
I've ever seen. I loved it.

524
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,360
It was great for who you were at the time.
And at the time it came out, you know,

525
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:04,800
and being 14 or whatever,
but rocky still a bad ass fucking

526
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,700
yeah,
but I mean if you take away the fighting,

527
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:10,080
I haven't seen rocky maybe
10 years. No, I know,

528
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:14,840
but is the acting actually good? It's
a Talia Shire. Brilliant man. Squashed

529
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,360
it three days ago and, and uh,
I'll tell you something right now.

530
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:21,120
That movie holds the test of time.
It is,

531
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:24,740
it is still a lot of great movies and
one of the most moving movies when,

532
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:26,650
when he's down,
he's gonna stay down rock.

533
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,420
I remember Burgess Meredith when he comes,
that actor who call and he says,

534
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:34,860
I want to be a manager rock. I'm 76
years old. I want to be a man. It stinks.

535
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,900
You know what my place,
and he does that whole thing.

536
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:40,500
Then it comes running out and puts them.
It was such a beautiful, it's brilliant.

537
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,130
It was, it was the great one
of the greatest character
pieces ever written in my

538
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:46,510
opinion,
to when he's angry and he's like,

539
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,620
this is all he's got in his
house and in birds around there.

540
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:53,520
And he's in and he's yelling and
screaming. That was so fucking real.

541
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,800
And then he was so moving when
he looks at Adrian and he goes,

542
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:58,430
I remember when I said that stuff
they said about me on TV. Didn't hurt

543
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,630
and he walks away if your
heartbreaks for man. Yeah.

544
00:29:02,631 --> 00:29:06,420
It's like when he gets his shit together
and got up and starts drinking raw eggs,

545
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
you're fucking, you start moving
your seat and you got goose bumps.

546
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:13,730
A lot of people credit, a lot
of dual credit. That movie for,

547
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,110
for our sharing in the
fitness craze in America.

548
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,910
Shortly I was whatever I was and when
it came out 11 or something like that,

549
00:29:20,911 --> 00:29:24,390
I drank raw eggs and ran around my block.
Damn threw up.

550
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,490
I just don't remember the dude. He
was a bad motherfucker. And it's,

551
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,740
it's a weird thing. It's
like, wow, how does a guy,

552
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,960
I guess he just gives up
on good movies and says,

553
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:37,480
let's just merge something queries and
explode. I always have a good time.

554
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,590
But yeah, that might be a bit, I think
what happens is like with Arnold, anybody,

555
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:41,980
uh,
you

556
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,620
know, when you've been,
when you surround yourself,

557
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:46,840
it's almost impossible to avoid
when you surround yourself with,

558
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,260
with a army of people that
make their living off you.

559
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:54,610
What happens I think is that like
anything at politician has been empowered.

560
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,290
Too Long.
You start,

561
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:59,680
you lose self awareness because
everybody's telling you you're perfect,

562
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:02,470
you're great. They laugh at your jokes
and everything. You're the emperor.

563
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,550
And I think that it,
the,

564
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,740
the biggest trapping of that kind of fame
is that you start to drink the Koolaid

565
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,240
and you lose perspective. You
lose self awareness. You, you,

566
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,480
you keep playing the same note over and
over again because people keep telling

567
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,314
you it's great.

568
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:21,640
And instead of like actually putting
yourself back in the real arena,

569
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,330
which is competing with what's really
going on and having people really give you

570
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:27,040
real critiques, uh, you know,

571
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:30,880
I was in an acting class and Burt Reynolds
showed up and he did some scenes in

572
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:34,130
class and I thought to myself, Burt
Reynolds at 70, whatever it is,

573
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:36,460
still not only doing scenes in class,

574
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,340
but kind of failing in front of people
and having a teacher critique his

575
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:40,174
performance.

576
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,460
And was he getting a lot of white
pussy because of this young white?

577
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:48,140
I didn't see that, but that's probably
why anybody would be in an acting class.

578
00:30:48,141 --> 00:30:51,860
By the way, it's Burt Reynolds
from boogie nights. So good. And so

579
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,190
areas, you know, he did a scene from
carnal knowledge with uh, uh, uh,

580
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,710
Catherine Bell from uh, anyway, but um,

581
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:01,290
well he's another guy, right?
Go back to deliverance.

582
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,160
Burt Reynolds was a bad motherfuckers.
He was, he was a bad motherfucker.

583
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,500
And then he got pain and then
he got weird. Why you start?

584
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:10,320
You start wearing a wig and
you get plastic surgery. I
don't think still though,

585
00:31:10,321 --> 00:31:11,340
Dude.
Those fucking,

586
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,970
there's something about him and those
smokey and the bandit movies where you

587
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:18,390
really wanted him to succeed.
He was a great movie star.

588
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,530
He is a good looking
guy who is always happy.

589
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,940
They always had a smile on his face.

590
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:27,240
He had a silly mustache and he was always
getting the girl and you wanted them

591
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:30,870
to as a fucking, wanted him to get
away from the law. And by the way,

592
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:35,310
he weighed off and mustache work.
Fucking rock that.

593
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:40,350
I grew up mustache. I do this thing for
a Californication. I had a mustache.

594
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,200
I looked like I should work in
a deli. That's a sexy. As I get,

595
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,080
like I should be making sandwiches.
He looks like a fucking, you know,

596
00:31:46,081 --> 00:31:50,310
a leading man. I looked like an ape. Very
hard to piss a mustache. Go. I go human.

597
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,640
This is what I got human here. And then
I go to AP and then I shave it down.

598
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:56,250
The human when I went with a
mustache wants just a goof.

599
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,010
And Mrs. Reagan was like,
what the fuck is that on your face?

600
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,880
It looks like a caterpillar.
Big, fat thick. I look,

601
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,690
I look like an aggressive
gay man who makes sandwiches.

602
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,230
I'm fuck guys.
And I make sandwiches in my deli.

603
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,590
You knew it works on Brian Jarvis.
He's not comedian Brian Jervis at all.

604
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,650
Brian Jarvis has eight.
Tom Selleck, my stash.

605
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:19,850
And if you'd know his comedy and he
knew his face, it's just perfect.

606
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,180
You say aggressive gay man.
Um,

607
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:27,260
for a while I never knew that Chrystal
myth was so popular in the gay community.

608
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:32,991
I had no idea that meth and amphetamines
and speed and an email nitrates and a

609
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:36,270
bunch of like really crazy chemicals
are so prevalent in the gay community.

610
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,030
So I would occasionally
run into dudes that were,

611
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,650
especially around West Hollywood near
the comedy store that had this weird,

612
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,750
crazy fucking look in their eye.
They were like really obviously gay.

613
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,850
I didn't know there
were hopped up on drugs.

614
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:55,180
So in my silly 25 year old
just moving to la mined out,

615
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,791
I was like,
wow,

616
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:59,270
there's a certain look that some of these
gay guys get when they're really crazy.

617
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,840
I didn't realize that there's fucking
like the hub of gay Matthews in the

618
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:09,110
country, you know, that it was
a sexual look like, oh my God,

619
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,050
I just thought that's what they look like.
Like it was like you, you have to have,

620
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,320
you have amazing radar for
anything off kilter. It's like,

621
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:21,010
it's like an animal of prey that sees
like if you put a cow in a, in a, um, uh,

622
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,950
not an animal print off of
the cow is an animal fray.

623
00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:26,110
But like if you put an animal
of flight in like a, um,

624
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:30,480
a stall and there was a paint piece of
like a string hanging that it hasn't seen,

625
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,450
they won't go in that stall and
you have a very good eye for,

626
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,970
for something that's like
that sharp f like there's,

627
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,460
there's music and all of a sudden somebody
comes in with a horn, like, ma'am,

628
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,480
you know, you're like, ah,

629
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:42,120
that's something you pick up on that
stuff better than anybody. I know

630
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,440
I grew up without anybody protecting me.

631
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,070
So I grew up in some weird
situations and you know,

632
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:51,580
we lived in a bunch of places where I
didn't have any friends and I was forced

633
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:56,230
at a very early age to try to kind of
like get an objective sense of the world

634
00:33:56,231 --> 00:34:00,820
around me without listening
to other people's opinions
of it, without, you know,

635
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,000
taking for granted that everyone else is
paying attention and that they've got a

636
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,490
grip on reality. To me, no
one had a grip on reality.

637
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,010
So I'm always like scanning everything.
And when I,

638
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:12,700
and I'm an honest person so when I see
someone there's, there's something off.

639
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:16,690
When I see something off it's literally
like it smells to me and I always use

640
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:17,920
two examples.
One,

641
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:22,030
I use the one with the girl with you
when I met and this is a true story.

642
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,520
She's crazy.
You've got to get out of here right now.

643
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,990
She's crazy and it wasn't just,

644
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,930
I wasn't just saying that
this is maybe a crazy girl.

645
00:34:28,931 --> 00:34:32,710
I was like emphatic about
it. It was cheese hot tab.
I'm out and I didn't know it.

646
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:36,520
She was doing meth and but I chose
to move her into house anyway,

647
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,860
but that's where it comes from.

648
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:43,690
And the other one was this guy that
turned out to be a child molester and my

649
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:45,520
friend would, yon was on the
podcast couple of weeks ago.

650
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:48,310
We talked about it where I met the guy
know right away they're hanging out with

651
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:50,580
this guy. Like he's their friend,
their buddy and right away I'm like,

652
00:34:50,581 --> 00:34:52,600
what the fuck is this guy doing
here? What do it, this was like,

653
00:34:52,601 --> 00:34:55,120
everything was like all
these alarms are going off.

654
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,220
He calls me up a couple
of weeks later and goes,

655
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,540
you're not going to believe who just got
arrested. And he says that guy's name.

656
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,280
Like, oh, he was a child child molester,
right? And he goes, yeah. He goes,

657
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:05,740
how the fuck did you know? I go, dude,
I don't know. I don't know how I knew.

658
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:09,150
But that was number one gas. I mean,
when you were younger, you met this guy,

659
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,870
you know? No, no, no, this
is just a few years ago.

660
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:15,040
But those are my two best examples of
coming in and just pick up right away.

661
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:17,950
I saw him and right away I was like, what
the fuck? And I even said to the guy,

662
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,530
what's up with that guy? What
was it? I Dunno man. It was,

663
00:35:20,531 --> 00:35:22,780
everything smells the way he's moving,

664
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:25,870
the way he was interacting with other
people like young kids, penis. Well,

665
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,290
so when you say smell stuff,
when you say smell,

666
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:32,470
that's a thing that they
believe about psychosis,

667
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:36,610
about some psychotic behavior may
actually may actually be triggered by

668
00:35:36,611 --> 00:35:37,890
pheromones.
And

669
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,780
literally you put out a certain smell
and this is all theoretical and you know,

670
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:45,270
they really don't exactly know like what
causes some people psychotic episodes,

671
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,020
but they think you put out a certain
smell and then people smell this and

672
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,770
they're put off by you. And so people
are acting weird with you. So you think,

673
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:53,581
am I weird?

674
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:57,990
And it starts this chain reaction that
literally can make a person slash go

675
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,210
crazy. You know, we know.
And we know when you,

676
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:03,150
the worst thing you can do to a person
in prison is to put them in solitary

677
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:04,920
confinement and leave them
alone with their own thoughts,

678
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:06,240
without interacting with sample.

679
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,550
So the psychosis is actually forms.
Yeah,

680
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,340
there's something that we need when we
interact with people and when we get it

681
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:14,821
wrong.

682
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:19,170
Like if you literally smell off and I'm
using the word smell because there's a

683
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:21,570
smell like that,
there's a real pheromones are like,

684
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:26,060
you don't really smell it right.
Vibrate at the wrong frequency there.

685
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,890
They're jerking differently there and
your body, there's a good book. I mean,

686
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,040
Malcolm Gladwell wrote that book, Blink
about that, where you pay you a human.

687
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:36,210
I can pick up a massive amount of
information. Did you, did you ever hear,

688
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:40,410
do you ever read that book?
He uses? An amazing example
of there was this, uh, this,

689
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,020
uh,
the Getty Museum paid a fortune,

690
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,190
a fortune for a statute
that was a young Greek boy.

691
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,990
It was called a Kudos and they found the
statute in Greece fully formed and they

692
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:55,150
were like, Whoa, this is, this
statue is like, I mean, they,

693
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,580
they had never found something and
it was worth a fortune. And again,

694
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:01,590
he was going to pay something like
33, $100 million, some crazy amount,

695
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:06,060
$30 million, whatever it is. And
it was a lot of money. And so, but,

696
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:10,050
but the thing is the Getty kept running
these tests on it. And this guy,

697
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,870
the guy who was a career
writer and people,

698
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,260
the first thing that came to his
mind, he said, when I saw it,

699
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,710
there was something off. I
said, what was it? He said,

700
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,520
the first word that came to mind was
fresh when I started. It looked fresh.

701
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,830
He said, and if it's something's
been in the ground for 5,000 years,

702
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:25,980
it shouldn't come out looking fresh.
So they ran all these tests.

703
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,850
They dug into the marble really, really
deep. They, they, they took the fung,

704
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:32,910
the mold on the actual
marble to see how old it was.

705
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,560
And they did all these tests and they,
I mean,

706
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:37,440
literally spent a year testing
it before they bought it. Okay.

707
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,800
So now they buy it and
they put it on display.

708
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:44,930
I believe they brought it to
Italy to or to show at this big,

709
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,970
there was a traveling
exhibit, exhibit, you know,

710
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,420
and the minute they were setting it
up to show as they pulled it off,

711
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:55,140
I believe the, and if you guys are
listening and you read the book, I, I,

712
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:57,480
it's been a while since I read the books.
So, but for the art, for the story,

713
00:37:57,481 --> 00:38:00,630
say the curator of that museum,
the guy who's the expert,

714
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,060
they lifted the veil to show
how they're going to present it.

715
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:08,650
And he's after all these tests and he
stopped anyway. He goes, w w w this,

716
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,030
did you guys pay for this already? And
I go, yeah, what are you talking about?

717
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,300
Oh No, no. Can you get your money back?
No, no, no. This is a fake. This is fake.

718
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,450
And I go, what are you talking
about? And he picked up on it.

719
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,670
He picked up on what everybody
else picked up on it. But they,

720
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:23,070
but they were so excited that they
actually found this thing that they didn't

721
00:38:23,071 --> 00:38:24,690
want to believe it.
And he said,

722
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,930
if you have to test for a year
on the authenticity of something,

723
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,330
all of you guys all have
your experience minds.

724
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:33,420
We're telling you right away there's
something wrong here. And he goes,

725
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,180
Ms. But he uses so many
classic examples why watch

726
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,650
this? When he had, they had,

727
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:42,670
they had people come to his office to a
psychiatrist's office and they would, um,

728
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,030
when they mentioned the words orange,

729
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:51,570
Florida and raising people left the office
much slower than they did otherwise.

730
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,930
Why?
Because when you mentioned orange,

731
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:00,310
Florida and raising people
thought of old people, retirees.

732
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,120
And so young people would
actually leave the office.

733
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:05,770
They would walk down the hallway
leaving the office much slowly,

734
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:10,540
a lot slower than they did when they
didn't hear those words. So what you hear,

735
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,010
what, what is suggested to you has a
profound effect on your physiology,

736
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,670
not just your mind. And he was his
so many incredible examples of this.

737
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:21,220
I can't even tell you it's, it's
incredible. So if you guys have,

738
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:24,540
if you guys are listening, the book
is called Blink and it's outstanding.

739
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,390
All of Malcolm Gladwell's

740
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,820
books.
So this guy in the,

741
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,850
literally a blink of an eye saw this
statue and new immediate Felton and the

742
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,270
human eye,
the human eye can,

743
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,880
you can glance at something
and pick up on everything,

744
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,610
much more information
than you can even imagine.

745
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,600
And we have learned how to do that.
It's called, um, he calls it slicing,

746
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:45,830
I think broad slicing or something
where you just, you know, pick up.

747
00:39:45,831 --> 00:39:49,090
I've always felt like there's
more sentences than we can
totally defined because

748
00:39:49,091 --> 00:39:50,740
there's a sense when someone's lying.

749
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:55,450
There's a sense that it's very difficult
to describe deceptive like language.

750
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:59,500
Because if you looked at it on a computer,
the timing seems to be pretty similar.

751
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,960
I mean, if someone's good at it, yeah,

752
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,340
they're timing is pretty similar
to the someone who's being

753
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:08,260
lie detector do it measures in a
very minute detail. Your breathing,

754
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:09,790
your respiratory rate,
all of these things,

755
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,580
the heat of your skin and
all that and that, that,

756
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,730
that changes when you're not
telling the truth. I've always,

757
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,400
well, unless you're a sociopath,
if that goes off though,

758
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:21,130
if you're nervous because you
ever been innocent of something,

759
00:40:21,131 --> 00:40:23,650
but someone thinks you're guilty and
when you're describing what actually

760
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:23,981
happened,

761
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:27,550
it sounds ridiculous and you feel
like you're guilty or not guilty does.

762
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,080
But a good a guy who knows

763
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,800
Britta lie detector it, we'll,
we'll take that into account.

764
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,040
And that's why when you do that,
they ask you very simple questions.

765
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:38,020
First they asked me, what's your name,
what, where'd you grow up? And you,

766
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,730
and then they'll start getting
into it slowly. Um, and they,

767
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,790
then they take that into account.
Now a lot of guys telling you,

768
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,920
you can throw off a lot of tech test by
getting your body tight to begin with.

769
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,210
And you said you fool it so you yeah,

770
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:54,040
get him to stay high as fuck. I don't
know. I bet you sociopath on Lsd.

771
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:56,170
It just blazed through
them with sociopath's.

772
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,030
Apparently it doesn't work because they
don't care cause I don't care. No guilt.

773
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,001
You would think though,

774
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:03,060
you could easily throw it off by just
like every time he asks you a question and

775
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:05,370
you just think of something
like my dog dying.

776
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,380
Yeah, that's what they get. They can force
you out of that. There's, there's like,

777
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,670
they know that people do that.

778
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:13,200
So there's tactics in order to like to
trip you up with questions are Kinda will

779
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,760
fuck with your emotions cause you don't
know what the questions are going to be

780
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:18,100
beforehand. So yeah, I know
what you're saying though.

781
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:21,130
I would think that to think about
Spiderman every time they ask you,

782
00:41:21,131 --> 00:41:23,570
have you ever stole money from this bank?
You think about spider.

783
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:23,930
Yeah.

784
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:27,210
Like razor blades in your ass and it hurts
so bad the whole time you're thinking

785
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:28,980
about the reason I say
razor blades in their ass.

786
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,030
Oh Brian, there's a thing that
I wanted to talk about this.

787
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,660
You were talking about that,
um, that statute being a fraud,

788
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,060
there's a thing called
the Voynich manuscript.

789
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,220
I don't know if you ever
known or heard about this,

790
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:43,850
but it was a book that was thought to
have been written in the early 15th

791
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:47,810
century and uh, it's in a language
that no one could decipher.

792
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,660
And they, uh, they sent this to the,

793
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:54,280
all the top coders and the experts
and the people that you know,

794
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:58,580
decoded the Nazi signals in the, in the
forties and the top coders in the world.

795
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:00,170
And people have gone over it for decades.

796
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:02,080
Nobody can figure out
how to fucking decode it.

797
00:42:02,081 --> 00:42:04,160
They have no idea what
this language is they have,

798
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:07,280
it's all like illustrated with
all these beautiful pictures.

799
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,560
But nobody wanted to admit that since
they had been working on this for so long,

800
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:15,930
it might just be bullshit.
And that's what it turns out to this.

801
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:20,600
It turns out that this is a, a guy,
they think the guy that sold it,

802
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:24,670
and Nigel initially to this
void, each fellow was a, um,

803
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:29,640
a con man and that he knew that Voynich
loved old manuscripts so he can cocked

804
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:34,060
it. This really elaborate old
manuscript, completely detailed, uh,

805
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,830
pictures of plants and all
these different things.

806
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:39,310
So it makes it look like there's
all sorts of knowledge in this book,

807
00:42:39,311 --> 00:42:42,020
but it's hundred percent horseshit,
a fake language.

808
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,460
And he wrote a 205th 40 page fake language
book and people have been studying it.

809
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:51,320
So shit since fucking when did
it get it? 1912. Incredible.

810
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:53,870
1912.
So for a hundred fucking years,

811
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:58,520
assholes have been going over this guy's
fake book and people is suspected it.

812
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,670
Early on people were like, well,
what if it's a [inaudible]? No, no.

813
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,050
And the more time goes on,

814
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:05,210
the more they don't want to even think
about the possibility that could have

815
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:08,570
been a fake. Yeah. It's kind of like
that. That's very human. It's very human.

816
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,670
Yeah. And this story, it's the been the
beginning of the book is just incredible.

817
00:43:12,671 --> 00:43:13,461
Will you just say,
wow,

818
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:17,180
the Getty got duped by a comment and you
know what they found the, uh, the, the,

819
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:22,090
the, the mold on the, uh, on
the, uh, cause it was taken
from out from a type of um,

820
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,070
uh,

821
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,290
a type of marble that can only be found
in a rock bed and like Thessaloniki or

822
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:31,730
like one of these like, so that guy,
the came from there and, and the, the,

823
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:35,210
the mold, they have these tests that
test the mold and how old it was. They,

824
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:38,960
there's a type of mold that grows on
a potato that you can grow on marble.

825
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,490
So whoever did this knew exactly
what they were doing. Wow.

826
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:46,220
And they just got away with 30, 40,
whatever million dollars to the,

827
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:49,780
at the Getty calming, just cut,
disappearing. People are such bad ass.

828
00:43:49,781 --> 00:43:51,920
It's like talk about just
calling all the way, like, yeah,

829
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,130
found the statute because
you want to buy it.

830
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,910
Like even coming up with that
like, hey guys, I've got an idea.

831
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,740
Let's carve a statue out of marble.

832
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:04,210
In the rock bed of Thessaloniki and
we'll grow a potato mold on itself.

833
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,440
A 40 minute get the fuck out of my office.
What?

834
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,980
Somebody must have a really known
a lot about art to pull that off.

835
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,270
That's what blows my mind.

836
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:14,000
There are people out there that are just
so good at stuff like that and that's

837
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:16,520
how they do it. They just, they just
hang the cut and they go, I'm gonna,

838
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,850
I'm gonna rip off a museum. All the
experts in the world. Yes it is.

839
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,090
It's a movie shit.

840
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,380
It's like you heard about that
Lee Martin Lee Marie Heist.

841
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,150
Oh yeah, the fighter MMA fighter
from England million dollars.

842
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,100
Something like it was in pounds.
I don't

843
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,640
know how it translates, but you'll
fight around a bank robber in the space.

844
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,670
It was like the biggest heist in
history. She let him out. Come on.

845
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,410
They were masks and guns and
they literally like planned
it all out and timed it

846
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:44,221
all out to the alarms.

847
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:49,221
They did it like a goddamn movie and he's
in a jail in Morocco and Morocco won't

848
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:50,910
send them back over.

849
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,860
Morocco's Morocco is pretty looked
out like if you're a Moroccan citizen,

850
00:44:55,861 --> 00:45:00,450
they protect you was a bit a few fighters
that got in trouble and just bolted to

851
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:01,830
Morocco.
Like Badr Hari,

852
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,640
Hari gotten a bit of travel bolted
to Morocco once you're Morocco, man,

853
00:45:05,641 --> 00:45:08,850
they kicked take care of their own.
So they love fighters in Morocco,

854
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,480
but leemary man,
he just fucked up too large.

855
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:15,300
They had to come after him even in
Morocco and when he was in Morocco,

856
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:19,480
by the way, on the lamb, he beat a
guy up and kidnapped him. Oh my God.

857
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,660
Rock God. He wasn't slowing
down. He got to [inaudible].

858
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,050
I had a feeling he runs that prison yard.
Oh, he's an animal. Yeah. That guy was a,

859
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,950
he's quite a character.
That guy got almost stabbed to death.

860
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,680
He got stabbed like some
insane amount of times.

861
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:35,880
His heart stopped a couple times.

862
00:45:35,881 --> 00:45:39,450
They had to restart them on the fucking
operating table and he had a video

863
00:45:39,451 --> 00:45:44,400
online of him six to eight weeks
I think after open heart surgery,

864
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,760
hitting the pads,
he's,

865
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:49,590
he then the like lean Mary's
back and chose Lean Mary.

866
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:53,040
They like bobbing and weaving and
throwing combinations in the pads to six

867
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:57,390
fucking weeks after open heart surgery.
We are flight. I'm going to take a nap.

868
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,660
I'm tired. I wish I know the
exact amount of weeks it was.

869
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:02,790
It might not have been six,
it might have been 12 whatever it was.

870
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:06,540
It was fucking ridiculous. This guy had
just had open heart surgery. Nelson,

871
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:09,120
he's hitting the pants and he's
getting ready to fuck people up.

872
00:46:09,121 --> 00:46:11,220
That's when he's saying, he's like,
I'm back. You fucking bitches.

873
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,840
He's thrown a punch.
The pads,

874
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,470
like this guy was getting hard with
a knife and I'll still kick your ass.

875
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:21,410
He's a legit gangster. He's, that guy
was legit originally from England. Well,

876
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,090
he lived in England and lived in,
fought out of England.

877
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,740
Flotsam tough guys to man fought Anderson
Silva went the distance with them. Wow.

878
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:32,040
And Anderson was a really coming into
his own as when Anderson came the cage

879
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:35,040
rage craze. Anybody pull off? Huge
high. A very good question, man.

880
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,470
A Guy just pulled off a fucking Picasso
Heist in San Francisco because it's

881
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:38,881
different though,

882
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:41,400
because the art is a really good thing
to get into because first of all,

883
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:43,170
jury is considered it
like a victimless crime.

884
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,730
So a lot of times you don't do a lot
of time. And also there's always,

885
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,840
and also there's just people
that that you can unload it with.

886
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,440
It's an interesting story that this one,
this guy walked into a gallery,

887
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:56,490
picked it up off the wall, walked
out, got in a cab, took off.

888
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,000
Nobody noticed him taking this
Picasso sketch off a wall. Wow,

889
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:02,580
that's worth like 200 grand.
And he just grabs it and leaves.

890
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:05,960
But the thing is like, good luck selling
it. How are you going to sell that thing?

891
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,980
Everyone knows what it is. You know
what I mean? You're constantly,

892
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:13,010
there's private sellers. I'm
really rich, Jeff Cha Cha,

893
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,070
Chinese tycoon who lives like you know in
Manchuria and Watson on his wall. Yeah.

894
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,950
You would have to know
exactly who that guy is.

895
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:21,610
That's like a tricky situation that

896
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,690
Picasso for sale give me a hundred grand.
Yeah,

897
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,440
but that's how you get caught though
too. You know, they sell it me. Well,

898
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:32,950
you got to let the guy who's selling
it make a big, big piece of the Pie.

899
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,813
That's what you've got to do.

900
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,220
If you've got something like
that and stolen and you're smart,

901
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:38,200
what you would do is he would go
to someone and say, listen man,

902
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:42,420
we both know this thing's worth 200 grant.
Give me a hundred you know, it's funny,

903
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,040
you take a hundred grand off of
it, and then the guy's like, okay,

904
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:46,690
well I just made a good
fucking chunk of money.

905
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:49,740
Now this is worth my risk and I
can ensure both of our safety's,

906
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,970
but I don't think criminals, I
don't, couldn't think criminal. I'm,

907
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,430
I'm like a gentleman
criminal. Yeah, exactly.

908
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,470
I don't think criminals like
that do it for the money.

909
00:47:56,471 --> 00:48:00,550
I think criminal charge and you know,
we all have,

910
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:03,040
some people have to get drunk.
Some people have to get, you know,

911
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,980
they have to do blow. Other people just
have to do crime. It's the same guy.

912
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:10,660
I'd recommend Jujitsu. My friends
get in there and get your freak on.

913
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,170
I start rolling and get back in there.
Buddy Javier victims,

914
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,710
who have you ever heard of him is,
I'm half a mile away.

915
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:23,470
His brother going there, but hey, it's
Javier here. Javier is his brother.

916
00:48:23,471 --> 00:48:25,780
That's like,
you know for is not that big a deal man.

917
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:27,280
I'm telling you I haven't
got the real deal.

918
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,570
I gave him an award at the MMA
awards at Fau February's here.

919
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,730
He is such a giant is a huge dude.
He's just a huge guy.

920
00:48:33,731 --> 00:48:36,520
He's a bad ass Jujitsu guy.
If this was just Jujitsu,

921
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,610
if MMA was just Jujitsu like it,

922
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:43,620
see he's one of those guys that really
became an MMA fighter as a Jujitsu

923
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:47,100
champion and had to learn everything
else from scratch. And you're like,

924
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:50,080
when you first like first
fought all Lawsky like you
look at that fight like had

925
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:53,980
no striking. Even when he fought Alastar
the first time had very little strike.

926
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:56,170
Yeah. He just wanted to get guys
to the ground and when he got out,

927
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,680
started the ground back then
he submitted them. Yeah.

928
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:01,030
It's a shame that there's not like
professional Jujitsu and professional

929
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:04,290
wrestling. Yeah, but there's not real
money and it, you know what I mean?

930
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,230
I mean like, and wrestling as well,
man, like real professional wrestling.

931
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,990
It should be a game. To me,
that's a very small audience who,

932
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:15,430
I'm going to say that, but fucking golf
is on TV, man. That's boring as fuck.

933
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:20,500
If you know, you could watch like
real, like high level wrestlers,

934
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:22,363
all that.

935
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,660
You can't tell me that if you didn't
get someone to explain it correctly,

936
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:29,230
you get some really passionate wrestling
champion guide. Explain it correctly.

937
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:31,450
Almost think that people would
watch wrestling did wrestle.

938
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:33,490
So they know the difference.
I don't know about that man.

939
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:36,670
I think people could watch it. Just
like, I swear to God, I could watch golf.

940
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:39,850
I know it's boring as fuck, but I
can watch it. There's a conclusion.

941
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,100
I know what their conclusion is.
This guy's going to hit that thing.

942
00:49:42,101 --> 00:49:43,690
And if it's going, it goes
in there, then he's happy.

943
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:46,030
And if it doesn't go in there, oh,
he's fucked. You know what I mean?

944
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:47,650
So in that simple little,

945
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,900
I don't play golf and I don't
know what strokes on power.

946
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,840
You should never pick up golf
because you'll become quicker.

947
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,400
I'm going to touch it. But you're,
you're so, you're so obsessive outside.

948
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,330
You'll love it. I can't do
it. Well I wouldn't do it.

949
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,810
Well that's what I always think about.
Like when, why would you play pool?

950
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,120
You know, like if it was outside,
wouldn't he make it all inside?

951
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,520
That'd be ridiculous because then he
could play in the rain. Like Golf,

952
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:08,930
you can't play in the rain.
Like especially in the
east coast. They're like,

953
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,430
I know when you get an addiction you
don't want to have to take the time off.

954
00:50:12,431 --> 00:50:15,280
In the winter. I played pool
all through the winter. You
know, you can always, yeah,

955
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:16,570
you can still play in the rain.

956
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:19,870
And that's what kind of makes it different
than pool is that your environment's

957
00:50:19,871 --> 00:50:23,320
always changing. So it's not like the
same flat surface every time you're like,

958
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:24,400
hey,
now the pool table,

959
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:26,800
it's like you're in a mountain and
there's an ocean in the middle of it,

960
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,100
you know? That is cool. And it

961
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,100
also is cool that you have to adjust
for like the wind and shit like that.

962
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,730
I think about like you're playing against
nature a little bit office is that

963
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,100
saying it's like they're the
longest distances that one,

964
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,950
the one the distance between your ears,
you know it's all mental.

965
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,020
So as his pool pool is,

966
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:46,070
what you're doing with pool is you
are have a slippery surface of a fast

967
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:50,060
Simona's eight 60 cloth, right? It's, it's
not even like felt. People think of it,

968
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:50,690
it's felt,

969
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:54,410
but it's a cloth and the balls roll very
nice and smooth and even on that and

970
00:50:54,411 --> 00:50:57,710
the balls are all waxed and cleaned and
they all weighed the perfect amount of

971
00:50:57,711 --> 00:51:00,770
weight. They all weigh the same
exact weight and these balls,

972
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,860
you're colliding one ball into another
trying to send it into a very small

973
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:09,920
space. You know, usually in
pro tournaments it's four
and a half inch pockets.

974
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:14,480
So you have very little room for error
and you're calculating the exact distance,

975
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,370
the amount of rotations that ball's going
to make on this slip cloth to get your

976
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:21,680
ball in the perfect
position for the next shot.

977
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,150
And it becomes this weird zen thing.

978
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,560
Do you know, on, on that speaking of balls
colliding into each other? Um, you know,

979
00:51:28,561 --> 00:51:29,550
you know what,
that,

980
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:32,910
that collider actually that's super
collider in Switzerland accident.

981
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,210
You know what it actually does, you
know what they're trying to figure out?

982
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,930
The Higgs Boson particle? Yeah. The
God particle. Well, when we are,

983
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:42,090
well actually they're that they're
trying to prove that Spring Siri,

984
00:51:42,091 --> 00:51:45,030
this notion that there are other
dimensions where matter goes, right.

985
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:49,500
And so when they collide these
things together, it within this,

986
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:53,010
this chamber,
when these two atoms I guess,

987
00:51:53,011 --> 00:51:55,170
or is that what the [inaudible] gonna
hit them at? And they, when they,

988
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,620
when they collide, they give off
to debris. They give off energy.

989
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,990
If that energy goes away,
if part of that energy kind of doesn't,

990
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:08,810
isn't there anymore with that would
prove that those tiny particles that are,

991
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,960
that are made actually smaller than
quarks are going somewhere else and that's

992
00:52:12,961 --> 00:52:14,910
how they're trying to prove
that there are other dimensions.

993
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:18,030
Yeah, but does that even make sense?
Like what of those article burnout,

994
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:18,761
you know what I mean?
Like,

995
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:22,380
like I know they said that energy can
never die or whatever. And if, if those,

996
00:52:22,381 --> 00:52:24,420
that those particles go
into another dimension,

997
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:26,860
but what if those particles just died?
You know what?

998
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,830
We were just wrong about that.

999
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:32,100
I don't know. Here's why. Here's
why. Because particles can,

1000
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,890
the two things can happen.
There's the answer.

1001
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:39,030
There's a lot of confusion when it
comes to subatomic particles and when it

1002
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,300
comes to any kind of quantum theory,
because it gets started,

1003
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:44,130
it gets kind of culty and weirdy
and it sort of gets a lot.

1004
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,470
A lot of it is theoretical,
but here's what they do know.

1005
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:51,210
They do know that particles can exist
and not exist. At the same time.

1006
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,850
They can be in two different places
at the same time and they're the same

1007
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:57,450
particle and they can disappear and
reappear and we don't know where they're

1008
00:52:57,451 --> 00:52:58,110
going.

1009
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:03,110
But there they do go somewhere and that
seems to indicate a level of evidence at

1010
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:05,980
least some in infants,

1011
00:53:05,981 --> 00:53:10,920
Massimo subatomic level that there is
some sort of a a passage way where where

1012
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,820
things go from one place and come back.
String theory is that based on on this

1013
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,890
notion that these, that,
that at the end of it,

1014
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:20,790
the very smallest particles are all of
these sort of vibrating circles of light

1015
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,790
and those are so small that
they can fit into different,

1016
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:25,950
different I guess of where,

1017
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:30,030
and the idea behind string theory is
that you have the Newtonian reality which

1018
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:32,670
is the reality you and I live in,
which is gravity and everything else.

1019
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:35,190
And then you have the Subatomic,
a reality which is,

1020
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,190
which is whenever you get into
sub atomic and subatomic world,

1021
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,970
a lot of times the very laws that
govern us are in fact the opposite.

1022
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:44,340
Light Bends,
gravity collapses on itself.

1023
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:47,760
All these things I don't know about but
I mean they'll talk about string theory

1024
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,960
is the, is is what Einstein
called this unification theory.

1025
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:56,520
This one thing that brings all of it
together so that you have one theory that

1026
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:58,950
can explain how the world really works.

1027
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,530
There's still a lot of controversy
with it. Yeah. Imagination. Yeah,

1028
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,740
but they,
but they are proving with math,

1029
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,250
with with mathematics is a very
good lecture on it and Ted but,

1030
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:15,690
but they're proving with they can
prove with math that there are um,

1031
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,040
that there are

1032
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,380
oh 11 dimensions, 11 dimensions, no
idea of the fuck they prove it. I don't,

1033
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:25,110
someone says that I just repeated, oh
they proved it with math. But you know

1034
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:27,610
the answer to that,
that theory that,

1035
00:54:27,611 --> 00:54:30,580
that question they were coming up
with the answer was 357 pages long.

1036
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,533
All numbers.

1037
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,610
It looks like fun reading.
She's a school talking about,

1038
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,380
it's like anything else man.

1039
00:54:37,381 --> 00:54:40,980
It's like what we discussed when we were
talking about fighting and MMA fighter

1040
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:43,980
is literally like trying
to get an argument with
someone and all you have is a

1041
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:45,770
language book.
Like for the average person,

1042
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:48,720
they speak a different language or speak
the language of mathematics and they've

1043
00:54:48,721 --> 00:54:51,390
been speaking this language for decades
and decades and they go deep, deep,

1044
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,260
deep into the rabbit hole.

1045
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:55,890
It's all well cause it's cause cause the
mathematical theory it was where you go

1046
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:59,010
is it is all imagination.
You know, you see these guys,

1047
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,580
they're actually really like,
you know this one dude is working on that.

1048
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,260
The particle collider.
It gave this lecture at Ted Young,

1049
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:07,770
really good looking kid like dressed
like with these awesome clothes and just

1050
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,350
kind of like cheese. You don't get laid
Dhea and, and, and, and yet he says

1051
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,300
brilliant businesses
like brilliant physicist,

1052
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,260
physicist sort of have a
history of being skirt chasers.

1053
00:55:16,261 --> 00:55:19,620
If you go back to Fineman, those like
one of fireman's, there was like,

1054
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:24,450
there was like a bubble chart that would
be like our girls around if no girls

1055
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:27,520
around, you know, here's
where it comes. Physics.

1056
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,480
Here's what's great about that is that
I'm not that smart and I have nothing to

1057
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:33,340
talk to girls about. For the most part.
I wonder what those guys have. Fine,

1058
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:36,150
but it was just such a genius.
I mean, he was just, he was so,

1059
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:37,590
he was such a good talker too,

1060
00:55:37,591 --> 00:55:40,710
and he had like kind of a cool accent
too because even though he was a genius,

1061
00:55:40,711 --> 00:55:44,730
he had a very sort of an ethnic east coast
accent, which is really odd. This guy,

1062
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:47,730
this guy who I'm talking about, he's
from Manchester and she talks like that,

1063
00:55:47,731 --> 00:55:49,380
you know, and he's not, he's unbelievable.

1064
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,820
He's got long black hair and he wears
this great sort of, you know these fast.

1065
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,420
I'm like, dude, you accent. You got,

1066
00:55:54,421 --> 00:55:58,110
you got hair like Johnny Depp and you're
off your and you can help build that

1067
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:02,520
collider. You're one of the leading
minds in your 28 no, my father guys,

1068
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,590
Aubrey de grey.
Do you know who he knows?

1069
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:09,090
He's the guy who's trying to make people
live forever and he has this incredible

1070
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:13,540
Maine. Oh, I know exactly what that all
drinks. I'm here like every day. Yeah,

1071
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,970
he's awesome. He's amazing. Did you know
Ray Kurzweil now has transcendent man?

1072
00:56:17,971 --> 00:56:19,590
He came out without, yeah,
there's a documentary.

1073
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,100
We've talked about it
a hundred it's a bread.

1074
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,880
I love that guy with that long beard.
He's like,

1075
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,670
awesome. People can live forever.
Yeah, well he's fucking on the cusp.

1076
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:29,790
I mean that guy is at the
head of, you know, the,

1077
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,210
all the creative ideas about genetic
engineering and you know, fucking crazy.

1078
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:38,440
Redoing Oregon's, you know,
they, they created a windpipe
recently with stem cells.

1079
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:41,530
Did you see that as an artist? What I
took out? Yeah. Well they, I think they,

1080
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,670
what they did is they took a,

1081
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:47,680
a cadaver's wind pipe and sprayed it with
stem cells and grew over the cartilage.

1082
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,460
Yeah. Which is like, okay, cool.

1083
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,230
And then they installed it and the
guy's neck and now he can breathe. Yup.

1084
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:57,360
And they didn't say anything with the
bladder's just at the beginning of some

1085
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,090
really smart guy, I can't
remember his name. And he went,

1086
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,900
we've not invented anything. I tell
people that and they don't understand.

1087
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:08,420
Nothing's been invented yet. Just
wait for the next 40 years. Oh yeah,

1088
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:11,590
you're around for the next century.
It's going to fuck everything. You know,

1089
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,501
out the window.

1090
00:57:12,501 --> 00:57:17,090
I put up with something on my Twitter
yesterday about a three d printer and it

1091
00:57:17,091 --> 00:57:18,590
was on a television show.

1092
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:22,010
There was a video of it on live
leak and this three d printer,

1093
00:57:22,011 --> 00:57:26,440
this guy takes a wrench and they put
the wrench into a copier and the copier

1094
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:31,370
looks at the ranch and figures out how
the wrench is built and then makes it out

1095
00:57:31,371 --> 00:57:32,204
of resin.

1096
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:35,720
Big Set of this incredibly hard resin
where you can actually use it as a fucking

1097
00:57:35,721 --> 00:57:36,350
wrench.

1098
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:40,370
So this thing literally physically made
this wrench with moving parts and prints

1099
00:57:40,371 --> 00:57:43,070
it all in one piece.
That's so genius.

1100
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,580
You know how a wrench has that thing in
the middle where you have to screw it

1101
00:57:46,581 --> 00:57:48,200
with your thumb to adjust it? Yeah. Well,

1102
00:57:48,201 --> 00:57:52,910
it made that all in one printing and
it made that part that screws what?

1103
00:57:52,911 --> 00:57:56,330
Your thumb a different color. So the
adjustment wheel was a different color.

1104
00:57:56,331 --> 00:57:59,690
It was red and the rest of the thing
was gray and it printed it in one,

1105
00:57:59,691 --> 00:58:02,660
three d form. It's fucking incredible.
You just tweeted that video.

1106
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,190
Yeah. Yeah. Just what, that's
why, you know, you can, uh,

1107
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:08,730
you can talk about magic technology is
way more incredible than any kind of

1108
00:58:08,731 --> 00:58:12,030
magic you can think of. I
mean, it is magic. I mean
that's probably what magic is.

1109
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,100
All these stories of magicians,

1110
00:58:14,101 --> 00:58:17,430
it's probably just they came upon some
fucking idiots. It didn't have fire yet.

1111
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,170
You know,
they came upon some dummies,

1112
00:58:19,171 --> 00:58:22,560
you didn't have guns and they had bank
sticks and they fucking just dominated

1113
00:58:22,561 --> 00:58:27,510
shit. That's it. Yeah. I mean look what
fucking magic would everybody forgot it.

1114
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:29,520
They remember everything else.
I like that.

1115
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,830
If we got all the magic and transcendent
man where they were talking about

1116
00:58:31,831 --> 00:58:34,170
basically that we are going
to mesh with machines,

1117
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,560
there's no question and our biology is
going to die off as you make eyes that

1118
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:40,650
work better as you make skin that
can heat up as you make, you know,

1119
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:45,180
your body's going to start meshing with
bio compatible components that mimic and

1120
00:58:45,181 --> 00:58:50,181
are in fact better than the very
material you currently live in.

1121
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,270
And,

1122
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:54,790
and it's going to be a world where people
are going to decide to go that way or

1123
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,440
the people who decide,

1124
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,920
you know what I'm going to die like with
my old biological self of it's going to

1125
00:58:58,921 --> 00:59:01,170
be interesting. It's going to be
interesting to figure out what,

1126
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:06,090
what would people choose to fight very
though about that movie is just the story

1127
00:59:06,091 --> 00:59:08,370
about him and his father.
Right? Right. Yeah.

1128
00:59:08,371 --> 00:59:12,900
Man recreated that was about a guy who
really misses his father and he doesn't

1129
00:59:12,901 --> 00:59:13,734
accept death.
Yeah.

1130
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:17,520
Well that's suspicious thing
except the people that fuck bucket.

1131
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:20,040
I'm going to something where they
don't. You're like, yeah, well it was,

1132
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,920
it was obviously to him it really like

1133
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:25,100
defined him as a human.
Yeah.

1134
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:27,740
I loved his father and you know
that's the same story with that guy,

1135
00:59:27,741 --> 00:59:30,410
Ronald Mallet, the professor out
of the University of Connecticut,

1136
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,050
that's the leading
theorist on time travel.

1137
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:37,370
It's father died when he was a kid
and it freaked him out so bad that he

1138
00:59:37,371 --> 00:59:41,750
dedicated his life to developing a time
machine because he wants to go back in

1139
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:45,830
time and saves all man. If that
doesn't make you want to fucking cry.

1140
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,740
And this guy's like, no, he's in his
fifties and he was like the leading.

1141
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,551
And not only that,

1142
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:52,940
he's figured out it at least theoretically
through his studies that that would

1143
00:59:52,941 --> 00:59:56,360
actually be impossible and that what's
going to happen with the time machine,

1144
00:59:56,361 --> 00:59:59,000
that the current theory is that
when a time machine is invented,

1145
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:03,920
what the issue becomes is then all time
ceases to become linear because everyone

1146
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:08,390
from the invention of that time machine
on to the end of time can come back to

1147
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:11,750
that moment in time and any moment
in between. And anytime they choose.

1148
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:17,000
So time loses all of its linear quality,
but only the moment the doors opened.

1149
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,330
That's when it happens.
So literally the, the,

1150
01:00:19,331 --> 01:00:22,610
the idea is that the way they describe
it as you can't travel where there are no

1151
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:27,050
roads once the road has been created from
that moment in time on time ceases to

1152
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:28,820
become what we define as time today.

1153
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:33,630
You know, I, I had a Einstein's
theory of gravity and, and,

1154
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:35,760
and they explained to me,
well like, well for example,

1155
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:38,350
it's not as 93 million miles
away from the earth. Why does it,

1156
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:41,860
why does it have an effect?
Why does it, why is it gravity?

1157
01:00:41,861 --> 01:00:45,040
It's gravity effect the
earth and so on and so forth.

1158
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:47,170
Why does the moons have the same
relationship with the earth?

1159
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,170
And the way I sent him scrap,
it was really interesting.

1160
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:52,120
He said time and space bends,

1161
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:55,870
it bends according to whatever
object is essentially in it.

1162
01:00:55,871 --> 01:00:57,640
So if you look at time
and space as a blanket,

1163
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:01,930
a tight blanket and you
drop a pool ball on it,

1164
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:06,140
what happens to the blanket is
there's an indentation then. So,

1165
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:08,680
so that's essentially what
it's doing to time and space.

1166
01:01:08,681 --> 01:01:12,930
It's bent that plane of time and space.
That's a way, wild way of looking at it.

1167
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,100
Now it's spinning.
Now take another ball.

1168
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,140
The smaller ball is rotating within
around that because it's, it's,

1169
01:01:20,141 --> 01:01:23,500
it's created an indentation
there and its own orbit. So your,

1170
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:26,380
so that little ball is now
going around the, you know,

1171
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:30,760
the perimeter of where that one
ball is sitting. It creates a board.

1172
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:35,320
And that's how Einstein described
gravity to a four year old. He said,

1173
01:01:35,321 --> 01:01:39,010
this is how gravity and time works.
And uh,

1174
01:01:39,011 --> 01:01:41,920
and of course the farther
away you get from that,

1175
01:01:41,921 --> 01:01:45,430
the less you spin or the longer it
takes to complete one revolution,

1176
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:50,050
which means then that you get, as you go
farther away, you know, you come, you,

1177
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,740
you don't age as quickly. I mean time goes
by much slower. That's right. That is,

1178
01:01:53,741 --> 01:01:57,340
it takes them longer. Why to, it takes
him longer to evolve around whatever,

1179
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,740
whatever is exerting gravity on you.
But isn't that

1180
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,800
crazy thought that you could escape
gravity and live longer? Yeah.

1181
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,780
Technically you would live longer.
That's right. And when you would,

1182
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,320
oh my God,
I have to go out

1183
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,680
relative like to for you,

1184
01:02:10,681 --> 01:02:13,980
like what I'm saying is if you went out
and you were 30 years at the speed of

1185
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,260
light and then you came
back and everyone was dead,

1186
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:20,220
the people that were children were
old people. You would be the same age,

1187
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:25,440
but you would feel like you would only
lived 30 years or whatever the fuck it

1188
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:28,230
was. You wouldn't feel like
you've gone through, no.

1189
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:30,990
You would probably a hundred
years be real for you,

1190
01:02:30,991 --> 01:02:33,980
I guess in your time in
30 years time. Sure. What,

1191
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:39,210
how does that fucking word moving slower?
Like what's going on? You're actually,

1192
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:43,890
if you're, if you're c because I
as you as take the, take the uh,

1193
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,370
the,

1194
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:49,260
the sheet and then take the ball
that's in the middle of the sheet.

1195
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,880
As you rotate around that ball,
if you're close to that ball,

1196
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,440
it takes, you know, it's a smaller
circle, isn't it? As you get out farther,

1197
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,090
it's like a record player.
Take a record player.

1198
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,940
If I put you on on the first line,

1199
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:05,430
it's going to take you a much shorter
time to make a complete revolution.

1200
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:08,220
I put you at the end of the record player
is going to take you a long time to

1201
01:03:08,221 --> 01:03:12,030
call it rally round. That's
time. And as you go further out,

1202
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:15,930
it takes you much longer to
complete a year. You're, it's a,

1203
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:20,370
it's a really wild concept but,
but that is where time and space bends.

1204
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:25,350
So that's where my feeble brain loses
its short circuiting because one reason

1205
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:30,351
why I'm losing it is because why is it
take more time when you're out further?

1206
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:35,340
When in the earth I time it going faster.

1207
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,750
I understand that there's revolutions,

1208
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:41,751
but why are you not aging and feeling
the same thing as those people on earth?

1209
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,590
If it's,
it's like I can't,

1210
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:48,480
the idea of alternate versions of time
and in space traveling at a speed,

1211
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:50,280
it's too much.
What's amazing though is that it's,

1212
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:54,690
it's been proven with
subatomic. Um, um, uh,

1213
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,580
when Einstein came up with these theories,

1214
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:59,280
we didn't have atomic clocks and things.

1215
01:03:59,281 --> 01:04:01,950
We didn't have the
actual tools to prove it.

1216
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:06,260
And it wasn't until later on when we
actually came up with the technology and

1217
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:07,680
the math to prove it,

1218
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:11,220
especially the instruments to measure it
and when we can't with the instruments

1219
01:04:11,221 --> 01:04:15,930
of measurement later on, say 30 40 years
later, it turned out the guy was right.

1220
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,480
You know? That's when you know
you're really smart when you're like,

1221
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:19,290
I've got a theory.

1222
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:22,020
You guys don't actually even have
the machines to measure this,

1223
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:25,410
but here's how it goes. Madison
being the first guy to be like, ah,

1224
01:04:25,411 --> 01:04:29,340
if I shoot your way out, time, time
and space bends like a blanket.

1225
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:32,970
Let me show you what this pool ball, and
he'd be like, what the fuck this guy's,

1226
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:35,260
what's what the gray haired guy.
Fuck.

1227
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,850
All I'm thinking about is banging girls
and what's, that's when he was in it too,

1228
01:04:38,851 --> 01:04:42,210
you know, kind of a pimp.
Einstein and Picasso said,

1229
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,510
a man does everything for women. He
fights bulls, he does it all. He Paints,

1230
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:45,961
fuck it.

1231
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:48,750
He goes to war for women so he can
look good and come back with a bunch of

1232
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,840
metals on his chest. I'm not saying
that's the case with everybody.

1233
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:56,220
It's amazing how guys like Einstein
and guys like Nikola Tesla,

1234
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:58,470
they live amongst you and I,

1235
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:03,390
but they literally couldn't be any
further from the type of person,

1236
01:05:03,391 --> 01:05:06,240
especially you and die. You and I
are like mirror images of each other.

1237
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:09,900
We always have been our whole lives. It
was like what I'm, when I first met Brian,

1238
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:13,320
it was on mad TV with his companies,
got rid of it and a, I was like,

1239
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:18,030
who's this fucking guy was just
was like immediately was like, we

1240
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:21,490
were the same age. We're both
ridiculous. We were both like,

1241
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:24,260
we can't believe I'm in fucking
Hollywood. I'm on a TV show. I'd be like,

1242
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:27,160
I can't believe I'm on a fucking
TV show either. Where are you from?

1243
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:29,380
Do you know why? You know? I
got along with really well.

1244
01:05:29,381 --> 01:05:31,960
I just did a show of hands and
I really liked with Jay Moore.

1245
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:35,830
Jamie and I hit it off right
away. He loves you. He was
talking, he's a great guy.

1246
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:40,870
He's a, he's a, he's an east
coast, so smart ass felt so
comfortable with the guy.

1247
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,570
He's such a, he looked in my ears
as good. So you wrestle. I go, yeah.

1248
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:46,150
And he used to wrestle. I didn't
know that. Oh really? Yeah,

1249
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:50,530
he was a wrestler and he's
just, he's funny man. He kills
me. He's a funny guy, man.

1250
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:54,160
He's a silly goose. Yeah, he's a
sort of a talked about you guys,

1251
01:05:54,161 --> 01:05:56,470
guy sort of a comedian.
He loves you.

1252
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,420
He lot of comics don't like
him because of that. You know,

1253
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:01,600
they don't like that jockey sense
of humor. He's a great guy. Yeah.

1254
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:04,220
He gets shit for that. I've heard
that about him. You know, some comp,

1255
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,830
they don't let that hold Jame or style.

1256
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:09,580
They should lift weights and take some
test task. Stop being fucking UNAMERICAN.

1257
01:06:09,581 --> 01:06:11,650
Cause Jim Morris a good
American on the merge.

1258
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,920
Have you been following this marijuana
thing that they just released the reports

1259
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,790
on? I the MED medical, yeah.

1260
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:23,320
The federal government has declared
there's no medical, no. Uh,

1261
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:27,850
I forget the wording,
but no valid medical use for marijuana,

1262
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:31,810
which is his fucking ridiculous.
We have a friend that has a,

1263
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:36,870
a brother that has, he's on the
autism spectrum. I mean, he, uh,

1264
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:40,090
he communicates with you. He's, you
know, he's right there, he's present,

1265
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:41,740
but he's very,
very shy.

1266
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:46,120
And you give this kid pot and
you can noticeably see him relax.

1267
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:50,500
And it's been known to
alleviate a lot of, uh, the,

1268
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:53,030
the social anxiety and the, the, the,

1269
01:06:53,031 --> 01:06:55,420
the weirdness that autistic people
having communication it with

1270
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,360
my own eyes.
I've seen it,

1271
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:00,580
I've seen that very same
example of somebody who was
a high functioning autistic

1272
01:07:00,581 --> 01:07:04,540
who would smoke weed and would literally
become lucid. And so, you know,

1273
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:07,120
you can say what you want. It's a chemical
that's going to affect your brain.

1274
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,190
Maybe some people that affects
them negatively, other people,

1275
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:12,050
it's gonna affect them positive.
But, you know, Eh, if you're gonna,

1276
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,090
if you're gonna tell me that,

1277
01:07:13,091 --> 01:07:17,560
if you look at the amount of damage just
in money terms and by the way in lives

1278
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,030
that alcohol does versus we'd,
one of the funniest,

1279
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:26,730
craziest things that make no sense that
weeds illegal, but, but I'll call I, I,

1280
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,450
okay. It's crazy. I mean it's it,

1281
01:07:28,451 --> 01:07:31,840
it's terrible the first person
to talk about this, but yeah,

1282
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,900
or exactly what I mean.
It's,

1283
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:37,360
it's an example of how slowly
in some ways things change.

1284
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:41,110
They change very slowly
because when people get ideas,

1285
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:46,140
ideas have ideas or really what move and
change everything in the world and it

1286
01:07:46,151 --> 01:07:47,560
goes back to these guys like Tesla.

1287
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:51,220
When you think about people who were
thinking of truly seminal ideas,

1288
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:56,340
like somebody will sit around and they
fucking just sit around and think like up

1289
01:07:56,561 --> 01:08:00,790
new constructs.
They change everything that we,

1290
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:04,030
they change everything for the next
hundred years. What a privilege.

1291
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:09,100
What an amazing accomplishment. Like what
an amazing accomplishment I'm going to,

1292
01:08:09,101 --> 01:08:11,710
I'm going to come up with,
I'm going to change everybody.

1293
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,080
Everybody in the world's paradigm,

1294
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,790
I'm going to change you live the
rest of your life. That's what,

1295
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:17,590
that's what it is.

1296
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:17,831
Well,

1297
01:08:17,831 --> 01:08:21,190
with these guys at the large Hadron
collider and doing her literally changing

1298
01:08:21,191 --> 01:08:25,810
our interface with reality.
Yeah. I mean they, they, they
have a new kind of matter.

1299
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,780
You know this cork gluon plasma
shit that they came up with.

1300
01:08:28,781 --> 01:08:31,210
One sugar cube was like 40 billion tons.

1301
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:35,500
I mean they're doing things that people
have only theorized for the longest time

1302
01:08:35,501 --> 01:08:37,870
and it's never going to stop.
This is what I tell people,

1303
01:08:37,871 --> 01:08:39,250
and I joke around about this on stage,

1304
01:08:39,251 --> 01:08:41,830
that we're here to make the big bang
and this is like a whole bit about the

1305
01:08:41,831 --> 01:08:42,700
large Hadron collider.

1306
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:45,400
They might be like the destiny of
human beings to reset the universe.

1307
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:50,290
We will never stop. Whatever we
learned from the large Hadron Collider,

1308
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:53,890
we will apply to the next greater thing
because it's going to keep going on and

1309
01:08:53,891 --> 01:08:57,810
if we survive 100 years,
the exponential increase of technology,

1310
01:08:58,270 --> 01:09:01,060
you just used the word, it's exponential.
It will be national development.

1311
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:03,400
It'll be beyond our imagination.
We were not,

1312
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:08,050
we cannot fathom a reality that will
be so far removed from the one that we

1313
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,520
currently experience. Right.
That's good. That's fun.

1314
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:12,350
From what I understand what
that marijuana think. No,

1315
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:15,740
this is actually the third time this
has happened where the US government has

1316
01:09:15,741 --> 01:09:16,450
said no,
this,

1317
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:21,450
there's nothing good with this shit ya
and but it's a good for us because now we

1318
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:26,740
can take it to the courts or whatever
the federal court or and and go against

1319
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:29,120
everything they say.
So like if they say no,

1320
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:32,330
this doesn't help headaches and we can
like put the proof up like no, it does.

1321
01:09:32,331 --> 01:09:36,680
Here's 5,000 scientists. So this is
actually a good thing that they did this.

1322
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:38,800
It's very obvious that
the system is rigged.

1323
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:42,460
The only reason why people would be going
after marijuana in this day and age,

1324
01:09:42,461 --> 01:09:45,730
we're wasting any resources on something
that kills nobody is they're getting

1325
01:09:45,731 --> 01:09:48,900
paid to do it. It's really
simple. You have to follow
the money. There's, there's no

1326
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:53,770
money. Anytime you pass any kind of law,
cottage industry grows up around it.

1327
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,680
There was an article that was a big
debate about ethanol today and there's an

1328
01:09:57,681 --> 01:10:00,810
ethanol lobby lobby and ethanol,
ethanol problems. I don't know,

1329
01:10:00,811 --> 01:10:02,630
you got to quote a lot of corn
and it's not that efficient.

1330
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:04,790
It's not that economical.
It's proven to be not.

1331
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:08,030
We've got only 10 million cars on
the road that actually are flex fuel

1332
01:10:08,031 --> 01:10:08,690
compatible,

1333
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:13,690
which means basically a 5% of the cars
on the road right now in the United

1334
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:17,930
States and and yet you have
a lobby and ethanol lobby.

1335
01:10:17,931 --> 01:10:21,170
You have 30 plants. Try getting rid
of ethanol. Go ahead. Good luck.

1336
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,900
The whole lobby thing man is always
freaked me the fuck out that that's legal

1337
01:10:24,901 --> 01:10:27,340
and that no one ever says
anything constitutional

1338
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:28,930
Ander under this you,

1339
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:32,500
the reason you have lobbyists and you
always have had lobbyists is because in

1340
01:10:32,501 --> 01:10:36,250
the constitution you have
the right to petition your
government. The the, the, the,

1341
01:10:36,251 --> 01:10:38,230
the reason lobbying comp,

1342
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:42,310
the reason lobbying has become such
a force and the reason politicians

1343
01:10:42,311 --> 01:10:47,140
essentially are beholden to the NRA and
these kinds of people is essentially

1344
01:10:47,141 --> 01:10:49,240
because whenever you create,

1345
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:53,410
as the government becomes
bigger and has more influence,

1346
01:10:53,411 --> 01:10:56,950
which is what it's going to do as it
grows, regardless of what side right?

1347
01:10:56,951 --> 01:11:00,850
Left is not a right and left to argument.
If something like this gets bigger,

1348
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:05,830
you are going to have industry that
that is going to find a way to influence

1349
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,960
that power structure.
How do you do it?

1350
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,990
You hire people who have
contacts with the government.

1351
01:11:10,991 --> 01:11:13,590
Either they work for the administration,
whatever might be,

1352
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:16,320
but that's what happens.
So now you have,

1353
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:20,730
now you have a county like
Potomac in, in, in uh, Maryland,

1354
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:25,080
which is one of the richest I think is
probably the third richest county in the

1355
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:28,410
world. Do you think they manufacturer
anything now? You know what they are?

1356
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:32,690
They're all government lobbyists.
Isn't that amazing? When my,

1357
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:37,560
when when you try to go from Potomac
to uh, Washington DC to the capitol,

1358
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:41,700
you'll be in the car for about two
hours and it's about 20 miles away or

1359
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:46,020
whatever it is. It's a parking lot.
Why? Because they're producing anything.

1360
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:49,680
Are they producing things? You and I can
use nat. You know what they're doing.

1361
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,210
It's a machine.

1362
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:55,620
It is a group of people from all different
kinds of industries that live there

1363
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,461
24,

1364
01:11:56,461 --> 01:12:01,140
seven and do whatever they
can to influence their
congressmen in their state.

1365
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,730
That's how it works, baby. And so, so
when you start talking about government,

1366
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,650
understand,
I've said this before,

1367
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:09,990
I always say regardless of what
side of the aisle you're on,

1368
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,980
government has two functions
to pass laws and to end to tax.

1369
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:16,470
Do you need laws and taxes?
Absolutely.

1370
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:21,450
The question is always in political
philosophy. How much do you need? Okay.

1371
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,380
And it seems to me that we're headed to
a point where governments can be 42% of

1372
01:12:25,381 --> 01:12:28,920
GDP. I mean, we, we government
is taking over so much.

1373
01:12:28,921 --> 01:12:31,800
So many people in this country are
dependent on a government paycheck.

1374
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:34,170
That's not the American way.
And I'll tell you something,

1375
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:36,060
it means you're a bureaucratic,
it doesn't necessarily, you're,

1376
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:38,160
some people are doing good things,
they're doing good things.

1377
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:42,210
But for the most part, the, the, the,
uh, country grows when it starts,

1378
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,450
when it produces things you and I need,

1379
01:12:45,451 --> 01:12:49,290
whether it's intellectual
ideas, physical products, uh,

1380
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:54,120
and we export those things and we are,
we need to stay the leader of innovation,

1381
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,400
innovation and ideas
is what it is so high.

1382
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,290
But when you have Potomac being that rich,

1383
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,750
because they basically would
lie on the u s government,

1384
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,700
there's something fucking very wrong,

1385
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:06,540
very creepy that it just keeps going on
and it never even gets mentioned because

1386
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:07,920
it's very hard to stop.
To me,

1387
01:13:07,921 --> 01:13:11,070
it's one of the two great things about
politics that have always fascinated me.

1388
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:15,570
That's one and two is cigarettes. The fact
that no one ever brings up cigarettes,

1389
01:13:15,571 --> 01:13:18,510
there's never a present president that
says we have to stop something that's

1390
01:13:18,511 --> 01:13:21,810
killing literally almost a half
a million, you know? Can I,

1391
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,260
you know what I love about
that example you just used in,

1392
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,920
in health and human resources.

1393
01:13:25,921 --> 01:13:30,600
There's a building in Washington where
you can go down one floor and there is a,

1394
01:13:30,601 --> 01:13:33,840
it's it's health and human health and
human resources or the health department.

1395
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:36,750
The Department of Health and Department
of Health had to huge campaign to get

1396
01:13:36,751 --> 01:13:39,720
people to stop smoking and
it's a good noble program.

1397
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,180
You go up three flights from
there or whatever it is,

1398
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:46,470
but it's in the same building and you
have a essentially a the department of

1399
01:13:46,471 --> 01:13:48,660
agriculture. You know what the
Department of Agriculture does,

1400
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:53,580
it pays farmers to produce tobacco because
it's called a subsidy. Interesting,

1401
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:54,180
isn't it?

1402
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:58,440
So you got one floor that's paying farmers
to grow tobacco because they have a

1403
01:13:58,441 --> 01:14:00,900
strong lobby.
And then if you go down three floors,

1404
01:14:00,901 --> 01:14:02,160
you've got the Department of Health,

1405
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:03,720
which is trying to get
people to stop smoking.

1406
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:07,980
You find me one business in the world
that behaves that way. But guess what?

1407
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:11,950
It's the u s government baby and that's
how we work. And that's your taxes go.

1408
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,920
Your taxes go to stopping
people from smoking with big,

1409
01:14:14,921 --> 01:14:18,880
big programs and they go to getting
farmers to grow more tobacco.

1410
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:23,590
That's what it's called. So it's
called fucking madness. It is.

1411
01:14:23,591 --> 01:14:27,610
And that's why if you don't educate
yourself on how the government works and

1412
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:30,010
what the history of
expansive government is,

1413
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:33,340
you're gonna pay a price for it out of
your pocket book. And with your freedom.

1414
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:37,360
It doesn't seem like as the economy
corrodes and they start trying to add more

1415
01:14:37,361 --> 01:14:39,310
and more government jobs,
people don't,

1416
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,750
they don't want to resist this because
it does provide some sort of a tangible

1417
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,640
boosting economy. They've created
2 million jobs, but you don't do,

1418
01:14:46,641 --> 01:14:50,420
they don't tell you that these 2 million
jobs are all sensor sends a census.

1419
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:55,210
Census People, census takers, useless
jobs, exact things that we don't need.

1420
01:14:55,211 --> 01:14:58,660
Exactly. You know, it's
just pay attention.

1421
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,400
When you hear a politician talk,

1422
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:04,120
pay attention to what they're
really asking for it. It's a very,

1423
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:06,640
very interesting thing
because it, the, the,

1424
01:15:06,641 --> 01:15:10,510
and all of us would be guilty of this
would the nature of human beings, if you,

1425
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:14,050
in my opinion, you look at history is
to, is to try to control other people.

1426
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,820
I try to do it. I try to do it with
people I love. I try to, I try.

1427
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,740
I try to help them. I try to, I'm trying
to control them. I tell them how to eat.

1428
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:24,330
It's my nature. I care about
people, so what am I going to do?

1429
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:27,190
I'm going to try to get in there and I'm
gonna try to educate you according to

1430
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:31,090
My, my paradigm. Well that's just my
nature. I'll never be any different.

1431
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:31,991
The problem,

1432
01:15:31,991 --> 01:15:35,050
the founding fathers knew that was part
of human nature and that's why they

1433
01:15:35,051 --> 01:15:39,250
created a checks and balances. That's
why they created the, the nation.

1434
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:43,620
This nation was founded on the idea that
you are self reliant, that, that, that,

1435
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:47,470
that we you, if you're going to
create a alliances and stuff,

1436
01:15:47,471 --> 01:15:51,810
they should be voluntary alliances,
not government mandated alliances,

1437
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,550
et cetera.

1438
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:56,440
And we're headed to a point where people
are trying to solve problems and, and,

1439
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:59,290
and that means I'm going to,
I'm going to pass a government mandate.

1440
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:02,980
I'm going to make you do this. Do you
know how the tobacco lobby thing works?

1441
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:06,070
Do you know how they pay the farmers?
The farmers get paid for their tobacco,

1442
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:10,270
plus they get paid to grow it. Is that
how it goes? Hey to it? We'll look at yes.

1443
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:12,740
Oh look. Just to make sure
that there's like everybody,

1444
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:16,000
let me give you another example. Do you
think we need as much corn as we do?

1445
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:18,580
You think we need all that corn syrup?
Do you think in fact,

1446
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:21,460
why don't we grow sugar anymore?
Because the corn lobby lobby,

1447
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:24,950
I think it's Archer Daniel
Midlands, uh, et cetera. Uh,

1448
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,880
I have a very strong lobbying
groups. So they said, let's, let's,

1449
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:28,930
we want to grow corn.

1450
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:33,370
We have a lot of people that will be
out of work if you don't subsidize our

1451
01:16:33,371 --> 01:16:36,520
industry. You know how much
money we give. We give,

1452
01:16:36,521 --> 01:16:40,630
we give out pack a
farmer's money every year.

1453
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:45,550
You ever worn anything without Paca
in it? Yeah. It's an animal that,

1454
01:16:45,551 --> 01:16:48,490
and what happened was
during the Korean War, uh,

1455
01:16:48,491 --> 01:16:51,520
we decided to make uniforms
out of our pack Alpaca.

1456
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:54,790
And I'll pack a blend because they would
be warmer because Korea is very fucking

1457
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:58,360
cold. But guess what? Those
farmers, they're still,

1458
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:01,690
they're still getting
paid to grow alpacas to,

1459
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:05,590
to hurt Alpacas and your,
you pay for it.

1460
01:17:05,591 --> 01:17:09,980
Now it might be 0.1% out of your paycheck,
but that's what goes

1461
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,230
on with the government. That's
what government, that's what,

1462
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:14,750
that's what farming subsidies are about.

1463
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:18,740
That we pay people to produce butter.
We have a lot of food.

1464
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,830
No, I said, yeah, I'm just saying like
every, if you have a farm, you get money.

1465
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:27,560
Is that every, does it every crop, the,

1466
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,370
I don't know all the details,
but for Reed Zachary,

1467
01:17:31,371 --> 01:17:34,700
I wrote a really good book about all
this stuff that everybody should be,

1468
01:17:34,701 --> 01:17:36,410
you should meet him. He's
smart. What's it called?

1469
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:39,920
I believe it's called the history of
freedom. And I read some excerpts of it.

1470
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:40,740
It was unbelievable.

1471
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:43,550
There was no way to stop the lobby system
at this point though, is there, I mean,

1472
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:47,990
is there no one's gonna no
one's gonna accept. There
absolutely is. They, in fact,

1473
01:17:47,991 --> 01:17:51,290
I would argue that there's
a huge movement, uh, to,

1474
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,650
to bring government on both sides of
the aisle to bring government into a

1475
01:17:54,651 --> 01:17:57,050
manageable price. You know,
it's small to make it smaller.

1476
01:17:57,290 --> 01:18:02,180
I mean every time they're on pell Paul
Dogma, but nobody's, so we actually,

1477
01:18:02,181 --> 01:18:04,670
every time you hear a politician
now wants to get to be elected,

1478
01:18:04,671 --> 01:18:08,410
they all have to justify their spending.
And let me tell you something. We are in,

1479
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,440
we are in dire,

1480
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:13,070
I mean a lot of government programs
are being cut and the whole tea party

1481
01:18:13,071 --> 01:18:16,280
movement, which is a formidable
movement in some ways. Uh,

1482
01:18:16,281 --> 01:18:19,490
and Michelle Bachmann and
these guys, they, they, their
platform is basically like,

1483
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,010
no matter what you say,
the government's too big.

1484
01:18:22,011 --> 01:18:23,720
Now I have some issues with those guys,

1485
01:18:23,721 --> 01:18:26,930
but I'm just saying that at the end of
the day they gained that much traction

1486
01:18:26,931 --> 01:18:28,550
because they said,
what the Hell's going on here?

1487
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,560
Got Michele Bachmann is one of two things.

1488
01:18:30,561 --> 01:18:34,880
Either she's the bringer of the apocalypse
or she's a see someone hired by the

1489
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:38,660
Democrats to completely discredit the
Republicans because she's at the helm

1490
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:41,860
right now. She's at the, I did a little
wasted movement research on her. I was,

1491
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:44,720
how about her gay husband? I don't
know anything about his fuck. Really.

1492
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:48,270
Dave Foley turned me onto it. Oh, you got
to watch the guy talk. It's fantastic.

1493
01:18:48,271 --> 01:18:50,270
Yeah.
Married 35 years ago on the podcast.

1494
01:18:50,271 --> 01:18:54,830
He's one of those guys that curious people
being gang. Oh No. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1495
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:58,460
Oh he's gay as fuck. You just hear him
talk and he can't hold the gay back. Yeah,

1496
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,040
I have a huge problem with every like
called customer service somewhere and you

1497
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:04,540
know you're talking to a black guy.
Yeah. That's how gay is. You know,

1498
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:06,740
and I'm not saying that every
black guy talks like that,

1499
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:09,860
but there are certain black guys at man
you call the guy up on the phone and I'm

1500
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:11,750
not saying there's anything wrong with it,
but you know,

1501
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:14,150
you're talking to a black guy.
This guy is one of those guys.

1502
01:19:14,151 --> 01:19:17,090
You hear him talking and go, that's
a gay guy. There's no doubt about it.

1503
01:19:17,091 --> 01:19:20,600
And he just talks about barbarians,
gay people being barbarians Healy.

1504
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:23,690
And we need to tell them that this kind
of behavior is just not acceptable.

1505
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:29,150
What asshole sucking cock
and prayer retreats and just
can't self self loathing.

1506
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,660
He's got self-loathing and he's married.
I can't stand hypocrites.

1507
01:19:32,661 --> 01:19:35,240
I can't stand people like that.
She wants to get rid of all porn too,

1508
01:19:35,241 --> 01:19:38,240
which is hilarious because then the
rapes would go through the fucking roof.

1509
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,340
It's one of the things that
they've realized in one thing.

1510
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:44,600
They actually believe could help child
pornography could actually help child

1511
01:19:44,601 --> 01:19:48,380
molesters not have sex with children.
It's a terrible idea.

1512
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:50,510
Scientifically,

1513
01:19:50,511 --> 01:19:53,180
scientifically though they're
proposing that this actually could be a

1514
01:19:53,181 --> 01:19:57,050
possibility because wood with,
um, it's, it's terrible idea,

1515
01:19:57,051 --> 01:20:00,320
but you know that you obviously could
never do it because those kids and those

1516
01:20:00,321 --> 01:20:04,700
videos are victims, but regular
pornography has been shown to curb rape.

1517
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:08,040
Regular pornography in other
countries is accepted in Japan,

1518
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:12,420
especially that pornography and even
violent things actually keep people from

1519
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:15,680
acting out. A lot of psychological
studies about the fact that, you know,

1520
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:18,210
movies like saw and stuff,
there's prop,

1521
01:20:18,211 --> 01:20:21,930
there are less maniacs out there actually
doing it because they can simulate,

1522
01:20:21,931 --> 01:20:25,590
they can see it being done and
get off on you bolt. Yeah. And I,

1523
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:28,290
they think they believe this about
pornography as well. Sex pornography,

1524
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:31,830
actually curbs rape totally makes
sense. It does. Yeah. I mean, look,

1525
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:34,630
there's gotta be some reason for it
and that doesn't make sense. I mean,

1526
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:36,390
it doesn't have to be some reason for it,

1527
01:20:36,391 --> 01:20:40,140
but I think the way the made
world moves outlaw pornography.

1528
01:20:40,141 --> 01:20:44,130
I want to make my own choices. I'm a
fucking adult. You fucking, what are you?

1529
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:47,010
I mean the, the Nazis were very
good at, at totalitarianism,

1530
01:20:47,011 --> 01:20:50,190
at controlling the total person
too. That's, that's tyranny.

1531
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,510
It's a form of tyranny.

1532
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:55,860
When people start talking that way that
people want to keep your gay people like

1533
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:58,200
fucking worry about your own kitchen,
asshole.

1534
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:02,270
I never had a gay person come in and
fuck up my whole, the way they are.

1535
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:05,790
They fucking up my, my fam, my
family unit with their presence.

1536
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:08,100
Is that how weak my family unit bond is?

1537
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,870
Are they tempting me within Cox
shot hop? Yeah, they are actually.

1538
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:18,440
Sorry. Hi. Yeah, dude, I'm with Ya.
I'm with you on the whole ranch.

1539
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:21,270
There's a bunch of people in this
country though that don't think that way.

1540
01:21:21,271 --> 01:21:24,060
That's one of the things about this
world is that, you know, there's,

1541
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:27,990
there's people in this life that are at
various stages of awakening and I'm not

1542
01:21:27,991 --> 01:21:29,700
claiming to be any enlightened being,

1543
01:21:29,701 --> 01:21:34,080
but there's people that have the benefit
of having more free time or open minded

1544
01:21:34,081 --> 01:21:37,650
friends live in a better geographic
environment where people think a little

1545
01:21:37,651 --> 01:21:39,080
clear.
I'm very open minded.

1546
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,900
There's a lot of people though in certain
spots of this country alone and forget

1547
01:21:42,901 --> 01:21:44,370
about the rest of the world,
but certain spots of the country,

1548
01:21:44,371 --> 01:21:47,460
but they're just in some fucked spot.
His spot,

1549
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,330
they're was just filled with dummy. I
just think, I also think that there's,

1550
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:53,730
there's a lot of social pressure
to stay, stay the course, you know,

1551
01:21:53,731 --> 01:21:56,760
I think it goes back to kind of
keeping like the breeding instinct.

1552
01:21:56,761 --> 01:21:58,890
I was thinking about this, I was trying
to write stay the course. So you say,

1553
01:21:58,891 --> 01:22:02,130
you mean like as far as like Christian
values and notice how it feels?

1554
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:03,690
Shy Guy in a working class,

1555
01:22:03,691 --> 01:22:08,691
neighborhood of Boston walks in with
bangles and earrings and I shadow he gets

1556
01:22:08,701 --> 01:22:12,240
beaten up. Why? Why is that
though? Why I have a theory.

1557
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:15,970
Why remember like a mud up David,

1558
01:22:15,971 --> 01:22:18,930
I'll use this thing when he was in
Jersey and he'd go to school and his mom

1559
01:22:18,931 --> 01:22:22,780
would pack pita bread and he'd get the
shit kicked out of pita bread. He's like,

1560
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:25,710
hey ma, you know, give me white bread.
Cause I know Pete, it's good for me,

1561
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:27,930
but it's not good for me when I get my
fucking teeth knocked him for being a

1562
01:22:27,931 --> 01:22:30,930
communist because I'm eating pita
bread. Right. It's hilarious. But why,

1563
01:22:30,931 --> 01:22:34,920
and I have a theory on it. Men, if
you look at like how men developed,

1564
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:38,770
like men are really good in groups. They
delineated authority very quickly. They,

1565
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:41,850
they uh, they work well. They're
very organized. They like hierarchy.

1566
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:44,790
They don't talk a lot. If they
have a job to do, they get it done.

1567
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,940
Think about like, you know when they're
like, well, like when you're hunting,

1568
01:22:47,941 --> 01:22:51,120
it goes back to hunting. When you got
to hunt a deer, you gotta, you gotta,

1569
01:22:51,121 --> 01:22:53,680
you gotta you're using hand signals,
you're not talking to,

1570
01:22:53,681 --> 01:22:57,390
he'll scare the deer away. So
you, you, you get into this
whole, this whole sort of,

1571
01:22:57,391 --> 01:23:00,360
you know, uh, a very
organized, you become one unit.

1572
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:04,590
I machine women don't bond that way.
They tend to talk and, and, and they,

1573
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:07,690
they verbally, men
actually don't. Men Bond.

1574
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:10,900
If you take boys and you take a ball
and throw it in the middle of a bunch of

1575
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:13,690
boys don't know each other,
they'll be come friends around that ball.

1576
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:17,530
Cause they start playing a game and they
break up into teams and they compete

1577
01:23:17,531 --> 01:23:20,020
with, they have to rely on each other and
they get very good and they do it right

1578
01:23:20,021 --> 01:23:21,670
away.
It's how you get boys to be friends.

1579
01:23:21,671 --> 01:23:23,920
Girls don't that girls
don't make friends that way.

1580
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:27,550
Girls have to make friends over a
period of time through experience.

1581
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:30,400
You have to talk shit about some other
girl. That's why we, that's why. Yeah.

1582
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:33,730
That's why when you, that's exactly
right. That's why when you adopt a child,

1583
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,280
if she's a girl and she's a little
older and you put her in a new scroll,

1584
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:39,280
she has a much harder time making
friends and the boy does when he's just,

1585
01:23:39,281 --> 01:23:41,730
you know around when you call, you
can just put it, yeah. When you,

1586
01:23:41,731 --> 01:23:42,970
when he's around fucking balls.

1587
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:47,230
Boys make friends with boys quicker than
probably girls can make friends with

1588
01:23:47,231 --> 01:23:50,380
girls. I wouldn't think that though
because girls are friendlier. No,

1589
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:52,980
but boys try to beat your ass when you
move into town. But, but, but the point,

1590
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:56,170
but I think the reason that the reason
that somebody gets beaten up when they

1591
01:23:56,171 --> 01:23:59,590
show up with all this decoration is
because you can't go hunting with somebody

1592
01:23:59,591 --> 01:24:01,900
with jewelry on.
It makes too much fucking noise.

1593
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:03,490
And he's walking around with his bangles.
I clang,

1594
01:24:03,491 --> 01:24:07,120
clang and I fucking deer are gone.
If you're shiny and you got glitter on,

1595
01:24:07,121 --> 01:24:09,730
why don't guys wear glitter
and Shiny Shit? Why not? Well,

1596
01:24:09,731 --> 01:24:14,530
what if he's shirt and a bow tie and
skinny jeans? I want to beat him. I,

1597
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,530
and that's pretty sleek for the woods.
I think that might also be this,

1598
01:24:17,531 --> 01:24:20,620
that and that. It might also be
you're, you're trying to get the girls,

1599
01:24:20,621 --> 01:24:21,730
you're not working with us.

1600
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:24,340
You're fucking showing off your
tits and ass and you're not,

1601
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:26,260
you didn't get permission
from US mother fucker.

1602
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:30,730
So like you can't walk in like the king
peacock because then guys going to be

1603
01:24:30,731 --> 01:24:33,230
like, that guy's a fucking peacock.
And I guess he thinks he said, yeah,

1604
01:24:33,231 --> 01:24:34,840
he thinks he's a tough guy cause
he's showing me his muscles,

1605
01:24:34,841 --> 01:24:37,450
which is an affront to me.
You're, you're, you're,

1606
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:41,050
you're preening what if he's really
skinny and he's got no muscles. It's like,

1607
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:44,500
you know, some guys are, he's fine. Like
if a guy like you were as a tank top,

1608
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:48,250
of course it's imposing. Thank you. But
uh, you know, some guys wear tank tops,

1609
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:51,670
like a real skinny guy, you know, like
Chris Rock was a tank top, you know,

1610
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:54,010
it's not school. I don't think that's
the guy that gets beaten up at tomorrow.

1611
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:57,880
Then the guy that wears a tank top is,
and he's all rocked out and he walks in.

1612
01:24:57,910 --> 01:24:58,360
There are a lot,

1613
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:01,540
there are a lot of guys like do that with
man when he's got a couple of drinks.

1614
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:04,440
I'm sure man, I'd be like, Hey, this guy,
you know what, I'm gonna start with that.

1615
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,780
Who would just hold onto you for 15
seconds until you're out of breath.

1616
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:11,460
That's all it would take for.
Especially for some juice head. Oh,

1617
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:12,700
you just gotta hang on,

1618
01:25:12,701 --> 01:25:15,850
it's a ride and you've got a 15 second
ride and at the end of that ride

1619
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:21,790
and then he can't push. Funny
Man. I remember my buddy
Bob Williams, that awesome.

1620
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:25,630
That is strong man who's a fucking
maniac and he's so fucking strong.

1621
01:25:25,631 --> 01:25:27,710
He so weird. Strong. And he'd
always go up to the guys and, and,

1622
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:30,430
and colts and he'd be like, what's up
Beatles? How you doing? God be like,

1623
01:25:30,431 --> 01:25:34,390
excuse me. Yeah. Ah, needles,
needles, calling needles, God.

1624
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:36,990
And he just wanted a little,
just a little like, you know,

1625
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,980
let me just squeeze you until
he was a wrestler, right.

1626
01:25:38,981 --> 01:25:42,630
Since he was seven with a chimpanzee.
I call him the human chimp. He, uh,

1627
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,230
had one of the best lines ever.

1628
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:47,080
Tell the story about the
guy who was fucking with him
while he was surfing. Yeah,

1629
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:50,460
he's the best. He's on it. He's on a
surfboard and his buddies with him and,

1630
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:52,480
and he's fucking dudes
come up these local,

1631
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:55,270
these Amalga locals would like
tattoos on the neck, rough guys.

1632
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:59,890
And they look at Bob and they go, hey
bro, get the fuck off our wave right now.

1633
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:03,040
And Bob Goes, why? He does this
thing where he have to know him.

1634
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:04,110
He's got to kind of an eye loose.

1635
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:05,510
She's like, Eh. And,

1636
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:09,110
and he looks like JFK jr has got like
the really thick hair and his eyes like a

1637
01:26:09,111 --> 01:26:13,250
real good looking guy. And they go
get the fuck off, get the fuck off.

1638
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:16,760
Our wave will kick your fucking
ass. And so Bob, you gotta know,

1639
01:26:16,761 --> 01:26:19,010
he's like really loose. He
never gets afraid of it. And
he goes like this. He goes,

1640
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:24,650
Eh, Eh, how long can you hold your
breath? And the guy goes, what?

1641
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:27,080
He goes,
how long can you hold your breath?

1642
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:30,440
Because I can hold my breath for over
four minutes so I could jump off this

1643
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:33,020
board. I grab you by the hair,
I bring you to the bottom.

1644
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:37,550
We take a little nap and you just
fucking die. And then I come for you.

1645
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:42,560
And they were like, oh, fuck this battle.

1646
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:45,470
And he's got these huge hands
and when he takes his shirt off,

1647
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,680
you can't really do anything about
that either. If they couldn't help him,

1648
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:52,430
oh dude, they would have to pull
him off. They would be underwater.

1649
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:54,740
There was his eyes.
Now you look into his eyes,

1650
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:57,800
it's like they had a great white
siting out in Malibu and he's like,

1651
01:26:57,801 --> 01:27:00,800
I'm going surfing and go, dude, there they
have the great white was is out there.

1652
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:04,040
They had a ceiling. It's mouth.
He's like, shut the fuck up.

1653
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:07,850
I punch a great white and his fucking
face. He, he literally see, he's like,

1654
01:27:07,851 --> 01:27:10,640
they won't eat me. I go, what do you
mean the one of, they smell it on me.

1655
01:27:10,641 --> 01:27:12,490
They're not going to a
fuck. Says, well that's,

1656
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:15,410
that's a good way to lose your life.
I know he's a fucking maniac.

1657
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,200
Wasn't the spawn a great white and
Malibu's ever recently? Oh yeah,

1658
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:21,620
that there was a great way to 200 feet
off the shore with a seal in its mouth.

1659
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:25,880
Holy Shit. It was like Holy Shit. And the,
and the fucking shark expert was like,

1660
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:29,540
ah, hey guys, they've always been out
there. They're always swimming under you.

1661
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:31,390
That's their breeding ground.
They eat seal there.

1662
01:27:31,391 --> 01:27:33,230
They're there all the fucking time.

1663
01:27:33,231 --> 01:27:35,270
So all you guys think there
are no sharks in that water.

1664
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:38,360
There are great whites swimming
under you all the time,

1665
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,120
but you're just not food to them.
They'd rather read a seal. Oh,

1666
01:27:41,121 --> 01:27:43,310
you're so lucky you're
talking David Blaine.

1667
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:46,350
David Blaine came to my house
and he and I said, he want,

1668
01:27:46,351 --> 01:27:50,890
he wanted to cross the ocean in a bottle.
Oh Shit. I hope. Fuck David. Sorry if I,

1669
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:56,240
I don't think he'd do it anyway. He
didn't this merge. You want to do this?

1670
01:27:56,241 --> 01:28:00,010
He's standing on literally ever. Literally
he wanted to do that. He wanted to go.

1671
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:03,230
So he's into these and so he
goes, um, but, but, but I, I said,

1672
01:28:03,231 --> 01:28:06,140
aren't you afraid a shark too? They
were talking about how whales, Orcas,

1673
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:07,970
if you're in a glass boats on myself,

1674
01:28:07,971 --> 01:28:11,930
crash the wit and they don't know
why wo and a guy died that way. So,

1675
01:28:11,931 --> 01:28:15,140
so he was like, yeah, that's a problem.
And I said, aren't you afraid of sharks?

1676
01:28:15,141 --> 01:28:18,710
I great whites. And he goes,
Oh, you didn't see my video?
I go, no. He goes, Oh dude,

1677
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:22,520
I'm not afraid in them at all.
So what on his iPhone he's got,

1678
01:28:22,521 --> 01:28:24,830
he's in a tough fuck.
I don't know if I can say this though,

1679
01:28:24,831 --> 01:28:29,080
because it might say it. Fuck
them. Fuck David Blaine. Nice.

1680
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:33,060
My wouldn't hold on it. No, cause I don't
want to screw up as special, but listen,

1681
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:36,650
you don't want to screw up this youtube
Ustream show was 2000 people. Well, yeah,

1682
01:28:36,651 --> 01:28:36,951
yeah.

1683
01:28:36,951 --> 01:28:41,870
You fuckers anywhere else in 659 I gotta
I gotta get permission from anyway,

1684
01:28:41,871 --> 01:28:46,170
the point is he, he's, he's swimming
with great whites. Uh, and, uh,

1685
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:48,000
all I can say,
I don't want to ruin anything,

1686
01:28:48,001 --> 01:28:50,290
but he's basically without
any protection at all,

1687
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:54,050
slowing his heart rate down and just in
the middle of the ocean with a weight

1688
01:28:54,051 --> 01:28:58,820
belt on flow, no oxygen, no nothing
holding his breath while huge,

1689
01:28:58,821 --> 01:29:02,160
great whites go by him and all
he can see his shadows. What?

1690
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:06,300
Yeah, that's David Blaine. He's not,
it's not magical though. No, it's not,

1691
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:09,830
not magical. He's, he's, yeah, he's, he's,

1692
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:14,250
I think he's very fascinating
in that he's made this living,

1693
01:29:14,251 --> 01:29:18,390
doing these endurance things and he's,
you know why he's always been David.

1694
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:22,590
His mother was, um, was,
uh, Jewish and, and uh,

1695
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:25,860
and so he was always obsessed with the
Holocaust, but also his mother died very,

1696
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:29,040
very painfully and slowly of
cancer. And I, when I met him,

1697
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:31,860
she was going through this terrible
time and it was very hard for him.

1698
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,940
And he always, he became
obsessed with suffering and with,

1699
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:40,140
with how to suffer with dignity,
how to overcome, in my opinion.

1700
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:42,000
I'm speaking for him,
but we've talked a little bit about it,

1701
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:45,490
but David's read so much about the
Holocaust and so much about, you know,

1702
01:29:45,491 --> 01:29:48,350
a man's search for meaning by Viktor
Frankl and those kinds of guys. He,

1703
01:29:48,351 --> 01:29:53,351
he's obsessed with the notion of how
one deals with all the suffering in the

1704
01:29:54,241 --> 01:29:58,830
world. He's got a huge heart
that's so is his fascination,

1705
01:29:58,831 --> 01:30:02,630
has led him into dealing with adverse
situations like really bizarre situation

1706
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:05,000
standing in that ice cube,
remembering names, you know,

1707
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,380
he broke the world record for
holding his breath. That's true.

1708
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:09,210
He did a Ted lecture on
it. He goes, you know,

1709
01:30:09,211 --> 01:30:11,640
he's trying to figure out a way to do the
trick. We held his breath and he goes,

1710
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,700
the craziest thing is if I actually
did it and he fucking did it,

1711
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:19,470
it's held his breath on Oprah for
17 minutes, but 17 fucking minutes.

1712
01:30:19,471 --> 01:30:24,270
He's got a record. 17 minutes, 17 minutes.
He really didn't heard of that before.

1713
01:30:24,271 --> 01:30:26,550
That was about [inaudible] seven he can
slow the heart rate down. He's amazing.

1714
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:31,290
Holy. That is no joke. I can't believe you
don't know him. He's a very special guy.

1715
01:30:32,150 --> 01:30:36,390
I always thought that he edited
his magic shit like Angel,

1716
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,460
let me tell you something. He, he's, he's
so far from Chris Angel. It's crazy. Yeah.

1717
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:43,020
Chris Angels,
angels and some big silly face.

1718
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:47,340
David David's been offered more money
than you can fucking imagined to do shit

1719
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:50,400
and he just won't do it. When he did
that thing for target, he, he didn't,

1720
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:50,731
he wasn't,

1721
01:30:50,731 --> 01:30:52,900
he was like making no money for his
magic tricks cause you wouldn't anybody

1722
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:56,790
sponsor him. And, and so when he did that
thing for target, he said, I'll do this,

1723
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:59,550
but you guys have to, I'll do this
magic. Do you want us to sponsor me?

1724
01:30:59,551 --> 01:31:02,520
But for getting money from me, you
guys have to, I want you to do,

1725
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:06,330
you got to let really poor children have
a total shopping spree and you're in

1726
01:31:06,331 --> 01:31:10,710
all your stores. So he's like a
really, he's really somebody who cares.

1727
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:12,080
I've got a lot.
And it gets,

1728
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:17,040
why do so many people hate him because
they don't know him because he's a,

1729
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:17,851
he's a stud.

1730
01:31:17,851 --> 01:31:20,530
And because the same reason people just
don't think people hate David Blaine.

1731
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:23,580
I think people hate me for Saint Joe.
No, I hate Chris Angel. Definitely.

1732
01:31:23,581 --> 01:31:25,340
Hey Chris Angel as well.
Um,

1733
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,380
because because they probably that
people don't like to be fooled people,

1734
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:29,341
no food.

1735
01:31:29,341 --> 01:31:32,670
There's no fooling them though because
he's just doing these endurance stunts.

1736
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:36,540
He's a weird guy in that he's don't
known as David Blaine the magician,

1737
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:39,570
but everything he does is just
like this weird physical feat.

1738
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:42,900
He's like a Houdini type character.
When I was,

1739
01:31:42,901 --> 01:31:45,360
when I knew him when he was 17 he was
obsessed with it and he just thought

1740
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:46,590
[inaudible] he's always
been obsessed with it.

1741
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:51,120
But it's kind of a shame that
he's a magician because you know,

1742
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:55,710
they are like world events when he does
something nutty. I mean it really is.

1743
01:31:55,711 --> 01:31:58,170
Like it or not, they are
world events, you know,

1744
01:31:58,171 --> 01:32:01,120
like what did he do in London where
we lived on a platform or some shit.

1745
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:04,570
What the fuck did you do in
a box spinning in a bridge.

1746
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,380
But he's always been obsessed with
this notion that how can I deal with,

1747
01:32:08,381 --> 01:32:11,120
if you put me shave my head
and throw me in a corner,

1748
01:32:11,121 --> 01:32:14,980
it was a bowl of grill in a concentration
camp. How can I suffer with dignity?

1749
01:32:14,981 --> 01:32:19,680
How would I be the best suffer? How would
I deal with that? And what did he do to

1750
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,740
bathroom when he was up in that box?

1751
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:26,650
Well, first of all, he was, he was
drinking and eating very little, but I'm,

1752
01:32:26,730 --> 01:32:29,160
I think he went, he had a thing that he
would go to the bathroom and I guess,

1753
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:32,970
I don't know. I got a bucket. Yeah, you
have to do. And everybody's asleep. Yeah.

1754
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:35,550
I guess you're only out a PK.
So hobbit,

1755
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,980
although it was a clear plastic
box and he was just sitting there.

1756
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:42,460
There should be some youtube video of
him pooping. Then if I remember, I,

1757
01:32:42,461 --> 01:32:43,990
I think they did.
They put it off.

1758
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:47,020
I think they put like a towel around it
at when he had to go to the bathroom.

1759
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,750
Right, right. If I remember,
that's how they did it.

1760
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:53,110
How long was he in that box
for? I Dunno. Like 18 days.

1761
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:55,810
Have you ever been to the Magic
Castle? Never. I have one.

1762
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:59,110
I've got a friend when he
liked did Jujitsu with two
is a magician. Really? Yeah.

1763
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:02,500
Yeah. He's always inviting me. But you
got to wear a jacket. You do. I know.

1764
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:06,040
I want to go
get out of here.

1765
01:33:06,041 --> 01:33:09,520
What your stupid fucking outfit I have
to wear. That's he seems so dorky.

1766
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:12,040
Why can't I just wear a nice shirt?
I have to wear a jacket.

1767
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:14,480
I liked it. I liked the way
you wear it for the UFC. You.

1768
01:33:14,481 --> 01:33:15,850
I was just kind of put on a black shirt.

1769
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:19,470
Friction plays me to wear their shirts
or were a black affliction shirt every

1770
01:33:19,471 --> 01:33:22,940
time, but then it flicks and right
now this one. Yeah. This is Jujitsu,

1771
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:27,660
my friend grace. Grace. This
is the Godfather. I don't know.

1772
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:32,180
Yeah, probably. You need some Jujitsu in
your life, doesn't he? No. I really do.

1773
01:33:32,181 --> 01:33:34,160
As a man is screaming out for Jujitsu.
This price,

1774
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:36,770
you got to do a little rolling you, but
you got to actually kind of built for it.

1775
01:33:36,771 --> 01:33:41,180
You've got some shoulders aren't, it?
Doesn't want to do it. It's not that guy.

1776
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,830
You're that guy though, aren't you? Yes,
I miss Roslyn. Why don't you go back in?

1777
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:48,200
I'm going, you got a bad
concussion, right? Tell that story.

1778
01:33:48,201 --> 01:33:52,290
That's a pretty crazy story. I just had
this war with his kid, Pascal and booboo.

1779
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:54,260
Manzini was watching me and
I wasn't going to give up.

1780
01:33:54,261 --> 01:33:57,170
And we wrestled at a street
sports and not the magnet school,

1781
01:33:57,171 --> 01:33:59,460
which is a great school and
he's a great guy. And uh,

1782
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:02,270
and we rolled and rolled and rolled.
I was probably the 40 minutes and I just,

1783
01:34:02,271 --> 01:34:06,590
nobody won. It was like coat to withdraw
the next day. I felt like my hands,

1784
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:07,453
like they would,
they,

1785
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:11,450
I felt like I was holding a hot snow
ball in my hands and I couldn't see very

1786
01:34:11,451 --> 01:34:15,170
well. It was all things where I just, I
just was, my perception was all messed up.

1787
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:18,880
And uh, I went to the doctor
and they did it like a cat scan.

1788
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:21,470
So having the guy said you just got
commutes, got a concussion. But for,

1789
01:34:21,471 --> 01:34:26,090
for about six months after that I would
have these weird sensations in my hands

1790
01:34:26,450 --> 01:34:28,910
because I neurologically did
something cause I'd hit my head,

1791
01:34:28,911 --> 01:34:30,890
I was in such a f it was such a fight,
you know,

1792
01:34:30,891 --> 01:34:34,040
you don't want to lose and you
go a little too crazy and uh,

1793
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:38,350
concussions are scary things, man. People
take that shit real lightly. Um, you know,

1794
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:41,030
I have friends, like I've got a friend
who got hit in the head by a golf ball.

1795
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:44,840
He said he was not the same person for six
months. No, I've been, I got in college,

1796
01:34:44,841 --> 01:34:49,190
I got kicked by four guys
on the ground and uh,

1797
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:52,860
and I remember just being truly
cloudy for five days. I just,

1798
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:56,480
it was just so cloudy. I just got my
head kicked and I was in the library.

1799
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:58,220
May Have you ever had that done to you?
Man?

1800
01:34:58,221 --> 01:35:00,160
It's really weird cause it's
exactly what you must have,

1801
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:03,740
what your sock feels like in a dryer. I
was just getting, I couldn't do anything.

1802
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:05,390
You know about Bill Roman.
I'll ski.

1803
01:35:05,391 --> 01:35:10,391
The football player had
over 20 concussions and he
created a bunch of brain

1804
01:35:11,751 --> 01:35:13,400
supplements he created.

1805
01:35:13,401 --> 01:35:16,070
He's got this stuff called
neuro one I've taken it before.

1806
01:35:16,071 --> 01:35:17,250
It's pretty fucking strong shit.

1807
01:35:17,251 --> 01:35:20,330
It's really good like for concentration
and showing that, you know, it's just,

1808
01:35:20,331 --> 01:35:23,210
it's basically caffeine and a bunch
of different brains. Stimulants.

1809
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:25,450
But I mean this guy has a,
I'm going to ask you,

1810
01:35:25,451 --> 01:35:30,451
it was a monster man when he's tried very
hard to try to kind of balance out all

1811
01:35:30,681 --> 01:35:33,830
the impacts that he's had. He really
tough to have that kind of trauma,

1812
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:35,690
concussions because it creates,

1813
01:35:35,691 --> 01:35:40,520
it creates pugilistic dementia mean those
guys all their brain shrink and yeah,

1814
01:35:40,521 --> 01:35:41,010
that's something,

1815
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:44,120
I mean it's amazing that just realizing
this over the last few decades too,

1816
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:44,410
you know,

1817
01:35:44,410 --> 01:35:47,260
I mean everybody knew that football
players got beat up and nobody ever like

1818
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:52,300
Kinda put ball is so beyond rough three
rate as a hundred percent it's not 95

1819
01:35:52,761 --> 01:35:54,770
it's 100% you play with pain in the NFL.

1820
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:56,930
That's why people talk about
this guy is really tough. This,

1821
01:35:56,931 --> 01:36:00,440
they're great athletes. Play football, go
run out and run it. Run a fucking uh, uh,

1822
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:04,070
football back in the NFL. Good luck.
Yeah, those are the super athletes, man.

1823
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:06,230
Those are the elite of the elite weeks.

1824
01:36:06,290 --> 01:36:09,380
What's really crazy is that
I've read that something,

1825
01:36:09,381 --> 01:36:13,160
some ridiculous number like
after two years of retirement,

1826
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:18,670
80% of NFL players filed for bankruptcy
and 60% of NBA talking about that last

1827
01:36:19,311 --> 01:36:23,570
time, how fucking five years
of leaving the NBA and the NFL,

1828
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:28,810
60% of football players file file for
bankruptcy because nobody's there to tell

1829
01:36:28,941 --> 01:36:31,700
him, hey dude, you know, football is
different. Don't spend your money.

1830
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:34,940
Nobody's ever told them that and the fact
that they had been compromised by all

1831
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:37,430
these impacts,
it's got to make them more impulsive.

1832
01:36:37,431 --> 01:36:40,850
Effector judgment affect how they
behave already dealing with a high

1833
01:36:40,851 --> 01:36:45,010
testosterone, fun, love and Kinda rough
forward tilted group. And these guys,

1834
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,510
these guys are the wolves.
They're the Alpha dogs.

1835
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:50,180
They come in and everybody
else is a fucking hen.

1836
01:36:50,330 --> 01:36:54,260
What those guys did you ever see like
a team of real football players come in

1837
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,580
here like savages?

1838
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:58,340
It's like being in night when I was
in Afghanistan and I just got caught.

1839
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:02,930
But guys who walked by me with beards
and long hair and he's, I was like, Oh,

1840
01:37:02,931 --> 01:37:06,680
who are those guys? Oh they're
really muscular guys. The the guys,

1841
01:37:06,681 --> 01:37:10,160
the guys who are not saying anything
with no badges. That's the dark side.

1842
01:37:10,161 --> 01:37:13,250
That's who that is. Oh. I was like,
oh, those are the real elites.

1843
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:17,060
That's why I smell gun metal and
death on him. And I was like,

1844
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,600
oh no,

1845
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:23,270
just the delta guys that was real
elite and like seal team six,

1846
01:37:23,271 --> 01:37:26,780
you know whoever they were and they
weren't talking to me. Yeah. What a,

1847
01:37:26,781 --> 01:37:31,430
what a strange way to go and live your
life to commit to being one of the most

1848
01:37:31,431 --> 01:37:35,060
disciplined, hardened,
well-trained, fighting,

1849
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:36,800
killing machines in the world.

1850
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:40,160
My buddy hangs with those
guys in Afghanistan and he
works with them and he said,

1851
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:44,060
I said, what delineates had delta force
guy from like a regular, you know,

1852
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:48,740
like a seal team or regular guy. And
he said they're exact. And I was like,

1853
01:37:48,741 --> 01:37:52,100
what do you mean? He goes, they're just
exact. They're uh, they're amazing shots.

1854
01:37:52,101 --> 01:37:54,490
They're good at everything, but they're
just really good at everything. Like,

1855
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:55,980
exactly.
Well rounded.

1856
01:37:55,981 --> 01:37:58,570
Like there's a place for everybody
in this world and there's a,

1857
01:37:58,571 --> 01:38:02,100
there's a place for someone to be a guy
who makes pottery and is a place for

1858
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:05,520
Picasso and there's a place for
fucking killers, man. I mean,

1859
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:10,320
as long as we're allowing
war as war seems to be legal,

1860
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:15,120
the president seemed to, I
believe, celebrate that we
had just murdered a bad guy.

1861
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,930
I mean, that's what the whole Osama
bin Ladin thing is. What they came in,

1862
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,980
the guy shot him above the eye and
then took a picture and sent a fee.

1863
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,840
If send it back to their computer to
facial recognition program. Ready?

1864
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:30,630
Your girls coming at me in the leg and
get out of the way like that in head in

1865
01:38:30,631 --> 01:38:31,920
case you got to suicide.
Ah Ha.

1866
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:34,890
Let me take out my Polaroid chicken
and I'm going to just facts.

1867
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:36,720
Let me scan this and send
it back to the White House.

1868
01:38:36,721 --> 01:38:39,120
He ain't got the guy's face.
Let's take this picture.

1869
01:38:39,130 --> 01:38:42,370
Let's run it through the
facial recognition there.
Yeah, it's an it's amps.

1870
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,640
Do a hundred percent believe
this story though. Yes.

1871
01:38:44,641 --> 01:38:48,450
I do know why there were 17 people
involved. I have to pay 70. Uh, yeah,

1872
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:51,990
70 dog.
So good luck trying to cover that up.

1873
01:38:51,991 --> 01:38:55,350
And then the one time watching Greg About
Jessica Lynch where they've tried to

1874
01:38:55,351 --> 01:38:57,900
pretend there was a gun shootout and
she was actually just in the hospital.

1875
01:38:58,060 --> 01:38:59,010
Go make your PP,
Bro.

1876
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:03,720
We're going to talk about
Pat Tillman to conspiracies.

1877
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:07,200
Brian's not buying them. Brian is my, uh,

1878
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:09,290
most Fox News like friend.

1879
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:13,370
Did you see the new footage of I think
with the World Trade Center, uh, footage.

1880
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:13,821
Oh yeah,

1881
01:39:13,821 --> 01:39:18,560
I did see from the one reporter's
perspective that show it's a completely

1882
01:39:18,561 --> 01:39:20,140
different,
I mean that shit looked like eight,

1883
01:39:20,141 --> 01:39:24,540
which is sitting there fucking melting
like the building that building or seven

1884
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:28,850
noises. It was amazing.
Totally, totally. It did. Look,

1885
01:39:28,851 --> 01:39:30,830
I've always said that that
tower seven looks ridiculous.

1886
01:39:30,831 --> 01:39:34,010
It looks like a controlled demolition,
but the fuck do I know.

1887
01:39:34,011 --> 01:39:34,844
I'm not an engineer.

1888
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:38,000
It might've looked like
controlled demolition just
because of the very bizarre

1889
01:39:38,001 --> 01:39:40,790
way in which it was injured that it
was injured on the bottom floors.

1890
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:43,790
And that's what gave him first and
everything pancaked down. Very possible.

1891
01:39:43,791 --> 01:39:46,880
The fuck do I know, but it does
look like a controlled demolition.

1892
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:47,983
But that video is,

1893
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:52,280
what I thought was most fascinating was
all the buildings are the cars outside

1894
01:39:52,281 --> 01:39:56,150
that had been blown up and on fire. Like
I didn't realize that that had happened.

1895
01:39:56,420 --> 01:40:00,770
I kind of like thought that of
course everything fell and collapsed,

1896
01:40:00,771 --> 01:40:03,770
but I thought there was probably like
just this massive pile of debris.

1897
01:40:03,950 --> 01:40:08,240
I didn't realize that all these cars were
like had been lit on fire and fuel and

1898
01:40:08,241 --> 01:40:11,320
everything just kind of fell down into
the street. I wouldn't want to, yeah,

1899
01:40:11,390 --> 01:40:15,320
that's what the airplane,
Hey, it just fucking fire.

1900
01:40:15,321 --> 01:40:16,640
And Brian comes back.

1901
01:40:16,641 --> 01:40:20,930
He's got a crazy fucking story of
his buddy that was a actual, um,

1902
01:40:21,110 --> 01:40:22,430
uh, uh, Wall Street.

1903
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:27,760
He was a stockbroker and he was there
while it all happened and he heard sounds

1904
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:33,740
that sound like car
accidents, just Bam, Bam.

1905
01:40:34,010 --> 01:40:36,560
And then he realized, tell the
story about your friend who, uh,

1906
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:39,320
had heard those sounds. He was at
September 11th, heard those sounds,

1907
01:40:39,321 --> 01:40:42,080
that sounded like car accidents
and then realize what they were.

1908
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,860
That's what there was this,
in fact,

1909
01:40:45,861 --> 01:40:49,430
there's a documentary that captured
it by the way. But yeah, he, he uh,

1910
01:40:49,490 --> 01:40:53,830
he just started hearing like these
goosh she was like two cars ramming and

1911
01:40:53,831 --> 01:40:56,950
Jewish. So there's 40 miles an hour
or 50 miles an hour. And uh, it was,

1912
01:40:56,951 --> 01:40:59,710
it turned out it was the bodies
hitting, uh, hitting the pavement,

1913
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:03,600
hitting the ground. How many people do
you think jumped? They don't really, I,

1914
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:04,780
they probably have that figure,

1915
01:41:04,781 --> 01:41:09,781
but a lot because what happened was it
got so hot and rather than burns you,

1916
01:41:09,901 --> 01:41:13,870
you jumped in and some people held hands.
Some people form groups and saw that.

1917
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:18,540
I saw that. Holy Shit. What a way to go
home. The way to go, man, it's a quick,

1918
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:23,500
it's a, yeah. I don't know your phone
time. God damn the has to be horrifying.

1919
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:26,640
Yeah. I'm afraid of heights.
So, uh, I, I perish.

1920
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:31,810
And it's saw saying you're afraid of
heights that is beyond the afraid of

1921
01:41:31,811 --> 01:41:34,720
heights. Well, you know, that's a
good story. It's like a, you know,

1922
01:41:34,721 --> 01:41:38,560
Jay Burke knows Jimmy Burke knows
a certain, somebody who's who's,

1923
01:41:38,561 --> 01:41:39,550
who was terrified of flying,

1924
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:44,290
she was seeing a therapist for it and
she finally worked up the courage to get

1925
01:41:44,291 --> 01:41:47,010
on a plane and fly.
And uh,

1926
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:51,910
the plane broken half in the middle of the
air, it broken half on takeoff. So she,

1927
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,040
she fell backwards in a,

1928
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:57,610
in a half a plane and you
probably alive for a little while.

1929
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:01,870
When you're playing brain breaks in
half, that's not fun. That's a, that's,

1930
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:07,070
that's a, that's a you. The secret is
real. And she manifested done. Man.

1931
01:42:07,071 --> 01:42:11,470
I know. Or maybe she was a psychic
and she predicted her own demise.

1932
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:15,130
She knew her timeline was tryna
raises a question, what's, what,

1933
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:18,070
what's the way you'd want to die?
Uh,

1934
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:22,960
I'd want to die with a mask on in an orgy.

1935
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:28,600
I'm glad you brought that up because a,
it's reminds me of a story.

1936
01:42:28,601 --> 01:42:32,470
I experienced a story that Brian was
telling me yesterday that it was so good.

1937
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:36,490
I said, stop talking, stop talking, and
told me this tomorrow. Well, you know,

1938
01:42:36,491 --> 01:42:39,040
low can't tell the names involved.
I can't tell the names.

1939
01:42:39,041 --> 01:42:42,040
There was a celebrity of them all,
but it's a very significant celebrity.

1940
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:46,660
When we were growing up, this
celebrity was a big star. Yes. And,

1941
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:50,500
and uh, I'll tell you it to say whether
or not they were a part of no, we cannot,

1942
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:55,090
we cannot say anything else. Telly
Savalas no, no, no. But, um, but, uh,

1943
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:58,430
the handsome young men,
can you say a music star?

1944
01:42:58,431 --> 01:43:01,540
A movie still not allowed to say.
And anybody who was a celebrity,

1945
01:43:01,541 --> 01:43:04,540
he was a celebrity, let's
put it that way. And, and um,

1946
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:06,970
and the reason I don't only say things
because, you know, it was a private thing.

1947
01:43:06,971 --> 01:43:10,150
I mean, I admire the guy. Actually,
I half are doing what he did,

1948
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:14,380
but I'm used to tell us what happened.
Well, you know, in life, I was just many,

1949
01:43:14,381 --> 01:43:17,530
many moons ago, many moons
ago, many, many moons ago, uh,

1950
01:43:17,531 --> 01:43:22,470
at least I think six years ago or
something. And I was single. Um, and I,

1951
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:26,860
I, uh, there are things certain guys
want to do, you know, you want to like,

1952
01:43:26,861 --> 01:43:28,810
I always say this, you go,
you want to stop a crime?

1953
01:43:28,811 --> 01:43:33,250
Do you want to kill somebody with a sword?
You want to fucking, you know, uh, uh,

1954
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:36,580
and then you want to bang six girls
at the same time. I mean, that's,

1955
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:40,990
that's one of my goals. Six. Well,
I'm driving a penis. Do you have,

1956
01:43:41,330 --> 01:43:45,400
and I do. Well, and I'll show
you, I'll show you after the
story. Uh, but I, I'm, uh,

1957
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:50,380
I'm driving to Venice.
I get a call from a girl I used to bang,

1958
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:52,310
who was a rig.

1959
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:56,540
Wonderful. I mean a
real Vegas pro. So, uh,

1960
01:43:56,541 --> 01:44:00,470
she gives me a call and she goes,
what are you doing? And I go,

1961
01:44:00,471 --> 01:44:05,450
I driving to Venice. She goes, she
goes, get your ass up to this hotel.

1962
01:44:05,451 --> 01:44:07,270
And it was, it was, let's
just call it the shirt.

1963
01:44:07,271 --> 01:44:09,650
And she was getting your ass to
the Sheraton right now we got,

1964
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:14,540
we got six girls and only two Cox.
We need you now.

1965
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:18,560
So I'm like, ah. I'm like,
Nah, I can't, I fucking,

1966
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:22,610
I got an audition for Sydney Pollack
the next day, which I did. Right.

1967
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:27,290
And I'm like, I need some Paul's brother.
Yes it is. Yes. The painter and I go,

1968
01:44:27,291 --> 01:44:30,110
I can't, I gotta go. I gotta go to fucking
the, I can't do it. That's probably, yeah,

1969
01:44:30,111 --> 01:44:33,350
I can't, you know what I'm
going on my way to now. All you,

1970
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:36,040
the only thing you can do in that
situation is just faint. Otherwise,

1971
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,880
just a faint,
faint Bica or,

1972
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:41,630
or die there or pull over and sleep and
wake up in the morning because any other

1973
01:44:41,631 --> 01:44:45,200
movement is going to bring
you toward six hot girls.

1974
01:44:45,201 --> 01:44:48,050
Cause I knew the kind of grocery
hot with, um, now I'm going,

1975
01:44:48,130 --> 01:44:51,700
you mean there's a fucking,
there's fucking en suite and the Sharon,

1976
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:54,590
will you tell the story before
you even go any further?

1977
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:59,860
You decided to tell this story recently
at the UCB I told the story at the UCB

1978
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:05,120
podcast and it was interesting because
they're all a very nice group and very

1979
01:45:05,121 --> 01:45:09,200
funny and talented group of people,
but they are, um, they're not,

1980
01:45:09,201 --> 01:45:13,790
they probably not live the kind of
sexual deviancy that I have gone through,

1981
01:45:13,791 --> 01:45:17,810
you know? And so I just feel that they
just seem like wholesome good people,

1982
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:22,220
you know, that don't have just this
deep dark matter living inside there.

1983
01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:26,570
And so I got up and told this story
that I'm about to tell you guys about

1984
01:45:27,110 --> 01:45:30,710
essentially my experience
in a fucking orgy. Uh,

1985
01:45:30,711 --> 01:45:34,620
and then what made you want
to tell this? I just, I,

1986
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:38,000
I fucking want to tell the
truth about who I really am.

1987
01:45:38,001 --> 01:45:40,090
I just felt like I just felt
like going up and going,

1988
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:42,650
and he's a really cute story. Stories
you guys. Uh, now let me tell you what,

1989
01:45:42,651 --> 01:45:45,740
I'll fucking deviant.
I really am. You know,

1990
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:50,570
when you didn't think there were cute
stories. I mean, I didn't really,

1991
01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:54,710
I didn't listen that hard, but, but I
know that people involved, they're funny.

1992
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:58,550
I mean in law, but cycling Moisha this,
the standard Kong Moishe's funniest shit.

1993
01:45:58,551 --> 01:46:00,980
He's funny. He's got a great
sense of humor and the other guys,

1994
01:46:00,981 --> 01:46:02,450
I haven't seen a lot of their work,
but it used to be,

1995
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:04,460
puts out some pretty bad ass
comics. I mean, it's funny,

1996
01:46:04,461 --> 01:46:07,070
funny fucking people like Amy Poehler
came out of there and you know,

1997
01:46:07,071 --> 01:46:07,431
great people.

1998
01:46:07,431 --> 01:46:10,490
And so they're telling their stories and
for whatever reason you decided to take

1999
01:46:10,491 --> 01:46:13,610
it down per lane. That's all. Tell
a story that you never even told me.

2000
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:16,820
I've never told anybody because you
know, I mean, it's just, it's just like,

2001
01:46:16,821 --> 01:46:17,330
I was like,

2002
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:20,390
I want to tell something that's a little
outrageous because I don't want any

2003
01:46:20,391 --> 01:46:22,190
secrets in my fucking life.
I just want to,

2004
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:25,070
I just want to be fucking out
there and I don't give a fuck.

2005
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:28,100
I don't care what really
care what other people think.

2006
01:46:28,101 --> 01:46:29,460
I care what my friends think.
You know,

2007
01:46:29,461 --> 01:46:33,590
and my friends all know exactly who the
fuck I am. All my friends know who I was.

2008
01:46:33,591 --> 01:46:36,290
So much freedom in that. But there's
always freedom and that I can't,

2009
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:40,580
I'm not good at keeping lot of
facade up. So I tell this story. So,

2010
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,450
so I'm driving and I go,
I hang on my first impulse,

2011
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:46,620
I can't do what I can do it now. I had
listened, there was this thing where I'm,

2012
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:47,560
you might've told me Joel,

2013
01:46:47,561 --> 01:46:50,910
but we were talking about a woman who
was dying of cancer. And they said,

2014
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:53,350
if you could do it all over again,
what would you do? And she said, I,

2015
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:56,260
I wouldn't do anything because
it made sense. And I am,

2016
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:59,520
I was thinking about that when I got this
phone call. I was thinking, you know,

2017
01:46:59,521 --> 01:47:00,810
I want to, I want to do, you know,

2018
01:47:00,811 --> 01:47:03,480
you gotta leave your life sometimes
and you've got to have experiences and

2019
01:47:03,481 --> 01:47:06,930
you've got to fucking do something
that kind of shocked and astonished as

2020
01:47:06,931 --> 01:47:09,030
yourself.
And by the way,

2021
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:12,900
you don't know a guy out
there who wouldn't want to
fuck six girls at the same

2022
01:47:12,901 --> 01:47:17,250
time. So I hear that. But I'm driving and
I, my first time, Nah, I gotta go get it.

2023
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:20,280
I've got to study my audition.
I got an audition tomorrow,

2024
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:23,070
but now I'm thinking only fuck
these girls. You know what I'll do?

2025
01:47:23,071 --> 01:47:25,890
I'm going to drive. If I see a
seven 11 I'll stop and get condoms.

2026
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,440
It doesn't mean I'm going there.
I'm not trying to grab my,

2027
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:31,710
but I'm going to stop and maybe if I
got another call, no good. Some other,

2028
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:34,290
oh look,
a seven 11 or I'm going to pull off,

2029
01:47:34,291 --> 01:47:37,060
but I'm definitely not going in this
chair it and there's no way I blah blah.

2030
01:47:37,061 --> 01:47:40,650
And I go, Oh, you guys don't have any
condoms. Buy Condoms. Phone rings again.

2031
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:43,140
Where the fuck are you?
So while this is going on,

2032
01:47:43,141 --> 01:47:46,560
you're basically like a
junkie that someone's saying,
come on, let's do some blow.

2033
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:51,200
I'm not basically like a junkie. I am
a junkie. All right. There's no it is.

2034
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:54,300
But that feeling when you're about to
do something really deviant is junky.

2035
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:57,480
Junky my heart.
My Heart's beating fast and I'm getting,

2036
01:47:57,481 --> 01:48:00,180
and I can get it out of my mind.
I keep going back to it.

2037
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:03,000
I keep trying to put it out of
my mind and I'm losing. And Matt,

2038
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:06,300
I'm losing the battle.
I'm getting pulled under.

2039
01:48:06,301 --> 01:48:09,240
They're adding more and more weight and
I'm trying to keep up. I got my, I'm like,

2040
01:48:09,241 --> 01:48:12,150
okay, I can't go under water. I
keep doing this. I'm treading water,

2041
01:48:12,151 --> 01:48:15,060
but they're just adding weights
to my legs with the imagery.

2042
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:18,630
I'm thinking about these girls.
Long story short, I go, fuck it.

2043
01:48:18,690 --> 01:48:22,020
I find myself at the Sheraton.
I go up to the suite,

2044
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:25,920
I get met at the door by my girl.
She's wearing a mask.

2045
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:30,300
She gives me a porcelain
doll mask to put on.

2046
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:31,800
So I go,
oh.

2047
01:48:32,010 --> 01:48:36,000
And then she gives me a strip of
paper with the rules of the game,

2048
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:40,500
which is that this is a
birthday girl and my, um,

2049
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:45,210
and I am fucking, uh, the only rule is
I can't hit or spit. I'm like, okay.

2050
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:47,940
I wasn't planning on hitting and spitting
these girls. I'm going to fuck them.

2051
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:51,390
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.
Is this stuff written down?

2052
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:56,360
[inaudible] printed is written,
typed. Very Neat Strip of paper. Wow.

2053
01:48:56,380 --> 01:49:00,030
So this is well organized. So
everyone has a sheet. I walk in,

2054
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:05,450
I walk in and I go and I see fucking
four of the hottest girls I've ever seen.

2055
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:10,260
One girl was getting banged on the bed
by some muscular dude and then there's a

2056
01:49:10,261 --> 01:49:13,970
dude who's kind of just standing off to
the side not doing anything with like a

2057
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:16,290
shaved jazz. And I'm like, I
don't like that guy. He's weird.

2058
01:49:16,291 --> 01:49:17,810
He's getting fucking looks all bloated.

2059
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:20,130
He's just like been lifting a lot of
ways and never did a sport in his life.

2060
01:49:20,131 --> 01:49:22,900
I'm like, whatever. Shaved
chests, orange is orange, orange,

2061
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:26,610
the shape and some weird mask. I was
like, all right. Then I look at myself,

2062
01:49:26,611 --> 01:49:29,340
everyone's naked dude. Yeah.
And guess what? She goes,

2063
01:49:29,341 --> 01:49:31,860
you got to take her clothes off right
now. You'd have to get no, no clothes.

2064
01:49:31,861 --> 01:49:34,920
So she starts peeling my pants off. She
gets on her knees and starts to work me.

2065
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:37,320
And as I'm getting work by my,
my old girlfriend,

2066
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:39,190
I got this porcelain doll mascot.

2067
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:42,630
I look in the mirror and I look at
my fucking dumb ass and I go, ah,

2068
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:45,510
there's the first off. Literally not
on my Dick is getting sucked. I go,

2069
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:50,170

Maskus is what is my legs?
I've got to start tanning.

2070
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:55,180
That's gross. I'm like, I'm fucking
gross. And it's one girl goes,

2071
01:49:55,181 --> 01:49:58,420
yeah, you, you at the white skin
and that doll masking a hard on.

2072
01:49:58,421 --> 01:50:02,320
That's not creepy. I'm like,
oh, Yay, whatever. So this,

2073
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:07,350
this really hot girl who turns out to be
the birthday girl who happens to be the

2074
01:50:08,021 --> 01:50:08,854
celebrities wife,

2075
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:14,550
she gets down on her knees and I get
pushed over to her and now I'm getting

2076
01:50:15,911 --> 01:50:20,080
worked by her. But the thing is,
she's really fucking good at it.

2077
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:24,280
And I go, um, I'm going to
go, I'm not a porn star.

2078
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:28,600
I when a girl is hot as mommy with a
mask on and I'm totally anonymous with a

2079
01:50:28,601 --> 01:50:31,060
mask on my face,
I'm fucking going to come.

2080
01:50:31,061 --> 01:50:34,260
And plus I got to come cause I got an
audition tomorrow, so I want it now.

2081
01:50:34,630 --> 01:50:37,030
So I'm like, oh. And I go, I'm
going to fuck you, keep doing it.

2082
01:50:37,031 --> 01:50:39,970
I'm going to come and the guy
and I hear you're to come.

2083
01:50:40,330 --> 01:50:43,030
And I look over and it's a guy, I'm
like, I think I recognize that guy.

2084
01:50:43,031 --> 01:50:44,740
I know him from somewhere,
but whatever.

2085
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:49,860
He goes whole lot shoe and a video camera
comes out and it's right on the girl.

2086
01:50:49,871 --> 01:50:54,050
And I'm like, Oh really? All right. I
guess this was like the Duke Porn. Woo.

2087
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:56,890
My knees lock up and who,
which by the way,

2088
01:50:57,070 --> 01:50:59,620
I never locked their mouth
or face where in her mouth.

2089
01:50:59,621 --> 01:51:02,920
My friends and the
husband is filming this.

2090
01:51:02,921 --> 01:51:05,950
He films that and uh,
yeah.

2091
01:51:07,110 --> 01:51:11,380
And then I hope I don't ever have to do
a Disney show cause I'm fucking fucked.

2092
01:51:11,770 --> 01:51:14,950
This is all fiction is, is all fiction.
But this is, this is part of the,

2093
01:51:15,070 --> 01:51:20,070
this is part of my fictional story
that I'm doing on stage one man show.

2094
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:25,300
Yes. Okay. Yeah. So now, now,
um, now I, uh, by the way,

2095
01:51:25,301 --> 01:51:25,751
I'm speaking,

2096
01:51:25,751 --> 01:51:29,080
this actually happened to a friend
and I'm speaking and telling you,

2097
01:51:29,081 --> 01:51:31,940
I'm telling the story. How can
we got enough disclaimers? Yeah,

2098
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:35,590
just tell her like three of them that has
happened to my friend and, and so, uh,

2099
01:51:35,650 --> 01:51:39,490
so now I go, oh shit.
I just lost it. Good.

2100
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,660
I can get the fuck out of here.

2101
01:51:40,661 --> 01:51:43,040
Cause this is a freak show and I
don't belong here. And I, you know,

2102
01:51:43,070 --> 01:51:45,150
I got an orange guy in the corner with,

2103
01:51:45,151 --> 01:51:47,950
I have a hard on and another dude banging
on a grill on a bed. And I got, I got,

2104
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:49,870
I mean, I'm like, I get it the
fuck Outta here, but you know what?

2105
01:51:49,871 --> 01:51:54,300
I had an experience. I'm going to go
and I can go make my Sydney Pollack, uh,

2106
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:56,800
audition. So I'm putting on my
pants and I'm about to leave.

2107
01:51:56,801 --> 01:52:01,630
I'm sneaking out and all of a sudden this
10 with a mass comes up and she goes,

2108
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:02,590
you're not going to fuck me.

2109
01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:06,500
And I go, uh, oh.

2110
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:11,060
I mean, I, I was going to go, I
have a d and I would almost say it,

2111
01:52:11,061 --> 01:52:13,940
I'll just buy it. Even know I was
mad at her. I'm like, she goes,

2112
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:17,470
you're not gonna find me. And she
turns around and I go, I mean,

2113
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:19,310
I don't want to be rude.
Maybe I should fuck you.

2114
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:22,970
So next thing I know my pants are coming
off and you know, that's it now. Now,

2115
01:52:22,971 --> 01:52:26,990
now I'm in the belly of the beast now
and I'm just seeing fucking read and I'm

2116
01:52:26,991 --> 01:52:31,880
just going crazy. I login and they're
like, hey, this guy's out rate.

2117
01:52:31,881 --> 01:52:35,940
I was appalling. I was appalling. My
energy level noises, I gave it up. I,

2118
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:37,640
at this point, I'm like, I'm fucking gone.

2119
01:52:37,670 --> 01:52:40,540
Now know on the other people
grunting or is everyone kind of road?

2120
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:45,020
They were kind of done
second, I'm going in for,

2121
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:49,130
and everybody else quit. They kind
of quit. And then that athletic,

2122
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:54,110
lucky not to be a dick, but my, my dig
was the mover then weren't doing so well.

2123
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:58,320
So I'm just fucking going crazy. I'm
like, this is, look at this shit. I,

2124
01:52:58,321 --> 01:53:02,540
we're really Argo. And, Oh
yeah, I'll switch. Oh, why not?
Hey, free country, whatever.

2125
01:53:02,541 --> 01:53:05,690
Fuck you America.
And I'm going nuts.

2126
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:10,820
And now I fucking get to a
point where, um, uh, uh, I'm,

2127
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:15,380
I'm now the girl who's the burden girl
goes, I want some of this. And she says,

2128
01:53:15,381 --> 01:53:19,470
don't use him up to the girl that
I'm going crazy on. She pushes, she,

2129
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:22,810
she pushes me down on the bed.
She gets on top of me.

2130
01:53:23,450 --> 01:53:27,110
So as I'm being taken care
of by this beautiful girl,

2131
01:53:27,111 --> 01:53:31,880
now I'm being worked on my back and
trying my hardest not to lose it.

2132
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:35,990
Um, cause she's so
beautiful. And so, uh, uh,

2133
01:53:35,991 --> 01:53:38,090
all of a sudden at this point,

2134
01:53:38,091 --> 01:53:42,410
the celebrity who now I now recognize
cause he's drunk and the mask is crooked

2135
01:53:42,411 --> 01:53:46,400
on his face. So it's like, I'm
like, bye. See your face. All right.

2136
01:53:46,430 --> 01:53:49,510
Well they are and they don't. And he
goes, I want to get home and get it.

2137
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,930
Let me get, let me, let
me get you, you know,

2138
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:54,650
he wants a sandwich or he wants to
go in, in south. So he wants to,

2139
01:53:54,651 --> 01:53:58,220
why she's on top of you. He wants
us to get in around. Yes. Oh,

2140
01:53:58,221 --> 01:54:03,140
she turns to him cause she calls
the whole thing's a disaster,

2141
01:54:03,141 --> 01:54:07,370
right. So she looks back and she goes, she
says to him, she goes, um, something like,

2142
01:54:07,371 --> 01:54:10,130
you know, like she does this, like the
silent kind of like language. Like, no,

2143
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:12,890
I don't want to do that right now too.
He's like,

2144
01:54:12,891 --> 01:54:15,830
come on [inaudible] and
there's a debate going on.

2145
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:20,420
So finally she hits back to me and
we, by the way, we're connected.

2146
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:24,260
We're connected. We're making love
at this point. Okay. Yeah. Yours,

2147
01:54:24,261 --> 01:54:28,070
your Dick's in her vagina and his
Dick in her butt hole. He tries,

2148
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:31,760
but he can't get it.
And many times it is Dick touch yours.

2149
01:54:32,230 --> 01:54:34,130
Never if you did.
And if it did,

2150
01:54:34,131 --> 01:54:36,800
it doesn't matter because I wouldn't
have felt that anyway. I don't care.

2151
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:39,630
I'm not squeamish there. I said
it really well. I don't know. I'm,

2152
01:54:39,631 --> 01:54:44,170
I'm doing all this girl, this girl. Well,
okay, so he's got a fungus on his balls.

2153
01:54:44,171 --> 01:54:47,390
I'll do that. I don't know. I wasn't even
thinking, dude. I was just like, this is,

2154
01:54:47,391 --> 01:54:50,840
this is an experience I'm already
done. I'm already fucked. So,

2155
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:55,000
so he can't get in. And, and she,
and he goes, ah. He goes, oh,

2156
01:54:55,001 --> 01:54:58,670
what the fuck are kicking in? And
she turns around and goes, what the,

2157
01:54:58,671 --> 01:55:00,980
don't fucking play me.
I told you I didn't want to do it.

2158
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:04,730
And they started having a fight about
not being able to get an harass as I'm

2159
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:07,700
having sex with her and they're having
a fight. And I'm thinking to myself,

2160
01:55:07,701 --> 01:55:08,650
I look back and like,
that's,

2161
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:10,580
this is the beginning of the
end and this relationship,

2162
01:55:11,230 --> 01:55:15,040
this is a weird thing to have a fight
about it. There's another issue like that,

2163
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:18,770
you know, you're fucking
Nigga, that's her, whatever.
I get that, but are swingers.

2164
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:21,110
So,
so he can't get in.

2165
01:55:21,111 --> 01:55:24,170
They have this fight and then he kind of
storms off and she kind of goes back to

2166
01:55:24,171 --> 01:55:27,050
me and we do our thing. And so, uh,

2167
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:31,190
so now I can't believe this is like
the most popular podcasts. Now.

2168
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:34,650
There goes my reputation
by the way. And so now, uh,

2169
01:55:34,830 --> 01:55:39,800
it comes time for me to, she wants
me to finish off in a porn fashion,

2170
01:55:39,801 --> 01:55:44,490
which would be again in her
mouth. And so I go, okay,

2171
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:48,150
and so now we're going to do
the whole money shot thing.

2172
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:52,770
And I just, it's been a long time and I
just lose it, you know, right away again.

2173
01:55:53,050 --> 01:55:56,790
And as I'm, you know, coming, uh, I,

2174
01:55:57,230 --> 01:56:01,440
I see Mr Celebi come running around with
the camera and he calls me and he goes,

2175
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:06,420
oh, what the fuck? Hey, why'd
you let him call him so fast?

2176
01:56:06,421 --> 01:56:08,700
I wanted to film it.
And she goes,

2177
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,820
what am I supposed to stick my dick in
his fucking up the stick my finger in his

2178
01:56:11,821 --> 01:56:14,040
dick. Don't be an asshole. I
don't have any control of it.

2179
01:56:14,041 --> 01:56:17,160
And they now they get an argument about
that. And as their argument, I'm like,

2180
01:56:17,180 --> 01:56:19,850
I go, all right, thank you so
much. I throw all my fucking man.

2181
01:56:19,870 --> 01:56:24,840
I run the fuck out of there. And
by the way, then they got divorced.

2182
01:56:25,170 --> 01:56:28,690
Have you ever seen that guy since
then? Oh No. That would came to mind.

2183
01:56:28,710 --> 01:56:31,210
My lucky guess. No, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

2184
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:35,250
I gotta I gotta I gotta save some
anyway. I wasn't there. By the way.

2185
01:56:35,251 --> 01:56:38,160
That story that doesn't belong to me.
That's a, that's a friend of mine story.

2186
01:56:38,161 --> 01:56:38,994
But I was new stream.

2187
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:43,290
His apparently died be noticed what
happened. Is it us? No, it's not us.

2188
01:56:43,291 --> 01:56:45,770
It's the yesterday cause
cause my old ninth,

2189
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:50,010
the people in the tribe is it
just Ustream crashed. Yeah.

2190
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,940
Sorry. Well we're still broadcasting. Yes.

2191
01:56:52,941 --> 01:56:57,920
You have to download it from my team
and sung the end part. The best part.

2192
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:01,610
So, um, you've never had a
situation like this ever again.

2193
01:57:01,611 --> 01:57:04,910
This was one of those
stories that you hear about.

2194
01:57:04,911 --> 01:57:08,990
Like that's like a Hollywood story I've
had. I've had those experiences. How many?

2195
01:57:08,991 --> 01:57:09,741
More than one?
Yeah.

2196
01:57:09,741 --> 01:57:12,740
How many times have you had been in the
same room with another guy? With a girl?

2197
01:57:12,830 --> 01:57:13,650
How many times?

2198
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:16,440
I mean,
I mean I don't want to get too detailed,

2199
01:57:16,441 --> 01:57:20,460
but when I was single in La and
I'm on and, and you know, with,

2200
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:23,190
with a house and no worries.
And that was a young guy.

2201
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:27,050
Why I did that kind of stuff all the
time. I mean, I didn't have, I didn't,

2202
01:57:27,051 --> 01:57:30,180
I wasn't a swinger. I didn't go to orgies.
I didn't organize anything. But I've,

2203
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:32,280
I was pretty good at getting,

2204
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:36,330
I think my friends would tell I was
pretty good at getting a group of great

2205
01:57:37,110 --> 01:57:40,110
openminded girls together and hogging off.

2206
01:57:40,730 --> 01:57:42,280
Funny thing to talk about though,
isn't it?

2207
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:45,730
It's a funny thing to talk about
because when you, when you start saying,

2208
01:57:45,731 --> 01:57:47,650
you know,
banged all these girls,

2209
01:57:47,651 --> 01:57:49,840
I bang this girl by now you
open yourself up to people

2210
01:57:49,890 --> 01:57:53,020
getting angry. I don't care. I know
you don't. I know you don't. I don't,

2211
01:57:53,021 --> 01:57:55,930
I don't because, because I do anything
wrong. I didn't do anything wrong and,

2212
01:57:55,931 --> 01:58:00,580
and I, and I would do it again and
I had a blast. I have fucking blast.

2213
01:58:00,970 --> 01:58:03,850
And it's true. And it turned
me on. Is that turned me on.

2214
01:58:04,030 --> 01:58:05,920
You want to turn me on you,
you know,

2215
01:58:06,430 --> 01:58:09,880
you throw a bunch of like six really cool
girls in a room and they're all like,

2216
01:58:09,881 --> 01:58:14,260
we want to fuck you. Uh, I, that turns me
on. Yeah, it turns me off. Gets me going.

2217
01:58:14,410 --> 01:58:17,470
Sorry. But no, it's a cry. But
yeah, I'm down. Isn't it funny? Yeah

2218
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:20,720
though, that you, you think about
this like the way people describe it,

2219
01:58:20,721 --> 01:58:22,670
like this is a fucked
up thing to talk about.

2220
01:58:23,090 --> 01:58:25,260
Yeah. But that's what's interesting.
Yeah. It's taboo because I,

2221
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:27,480
when I was telling the story of UCB,
it was actually kind of an experiment.

2222
01:58:27,481 --> 01:58:27,960
I was like,

2223
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:31,740
I want to see what happens to this
audience when I tell a real story about

2224
01:58:31,741 --> 01:58:35,190
something that most people would never
admit to because it makes you look to a

2225
01:58:35,191 --> 01:58:38,560
lot of people bad. It may or it makes
you look like a pervert or anything,

2226
01:58:38,700 --> 01:58:41,980
but I don't believe in that shit.
I don't buy it. And, and um,

2227
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:46,460
anybody knows me knows. I'm just not hung
up on that stuff. I'm really not. And uh,

2228
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:49,660
uh, and I wouldn't change that
experience for the fucking world.

2229
01:58:49,661 --> 01:58:50,560
What's that guy's name?

2230
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:54,010
Vincent Gallo as what his name is he the
one that did that movie brown butter.

2231
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:59,160
We're Chloe and she still has a career
and she blew him in the movie the movie.

2232
01:59:00,940 --> 01:59:04,270
And in the scene, she actually sucks
his dick and he kept, you know,

2233
01:59:04,271 --> 01:59:07,580
I notice about, especially women
when, uh, what I notice about, um,

2234
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:10,150
I told that story and I were
a lot of women in the UCB.

2235
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:13,630
Women were really open when
women were really like, found.

2236
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:14,840
Like I had a couple women say hi.

2237
01:59:14,841 --> 01:59:18,610
I found that story really
honest and refreshing. And,
and, and how do you end it?

2238
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:23,320
What do you say he received? The theme
was it was a slippery slope once you,

2239
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:25,030
like if somebody calls you about an orgy,

2240
01:59:25,031 --> 01:59:28,090
if you don't turn around and drive
home immediately and throw handcuffs on

2241
01:59:28,091 --> 01:59:32,290
yourself, anything else is a slippery
slope and you're going down that slope.

2242
01:59:32,530 --> 01:59:36,400
If you're a guy like me. So you got
to fucking, you know, and that's, and,

2243
01:59:36,401 --> 01:59:41,401
and you know that story about getting a
call like that is what a lot of us deal

2244
01:59:42,131 --> 01:59:44,890
with on a day to day basis with
our addictions. Whether it's,

2245
01:59:44,891 --> 01:59:47,710
I'm trying to stop smoking,
I'm trying to stop drinking,

2246
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:51,250
I'm trying to stop fucking watching
porn all day. Whatever it is.

2247
01:59:51,251 --> 01:59:54,070
People have these addictions trying to
stop meth. I'm trying to stop heroin.

2248
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:59,330
These, it's the same addiction, man. It's
the same. It's the same impulse. And,

2249
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:04,340
and so just to suggest that I don't have
some of that in me and that I in the

2250
02:00:04,511 --> 02:00:07,990
past haven't acted on, that
is dishonest. And by the way,

2251
02:00:07,991 --> 02:00:11,170
his concern is suggesting I'm not human.
Fuck you.

2252
02:00:11,171 --> 02:00:14,770
If you've got a judgment on that. I, I
thought it was awesome. And you know,

2253
02:00:14,771 --> 02:00:18,320
and that's how it is. What do you
think makes that impulse? What is it?

2254
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:20,970
It W I know exactly the
legendary purposes. It's,

2255
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:22,270
I know exactly what I think it is.

2256
02:00:22,450 --> 02:00:26,590
I think that that kind of behavior I
heavier ultimately does two things.

2257
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:29,810
A couple of things. Historically
it threatens, first of all, it's,

2258
02:00:29,811 --> 02:00:34,060
it's unsafe activity, but you can actually
catch a disease and you can spread it.

2259
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:36,970
So there's that. I mean, I use
condoms and stuff, but there's this,

2260
02:00:36,971 --> 02:00:40,450
there's this notion that you historically
have you had sex with a lot of people.

2261
02:00:40,451 --> 02:00:43,120
You came down with a shit like syphilis.
And we have it,

2262
02:00:43,121 --> 02:00:47,140
we have a historical memory of promiscuous
behavior leads to really shitty

2263
02:00:47,141 --> 02:00:48,400
diseases.
That's the first thing.

2264
02:00:48,610 --> 02:00:53,530
But I also think that a society has to
have certain norms and certain rules. Um,

2265
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:58,360
because that was always the way you were
able to be more profit, more efficient.

2266
02:00:58,361 --> 02:01:02,080
I think when you had a credo that
people bought into, they were,

2267
02:01:02,081 --> 02:01:03,910
it was easier to organize things.

2268
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:08,860
It was easier to create a
cohesive culture, uh, a cohesive,

2269
02:01:08,861 --> 02:01:10,060
a belief system.

2270
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:14,590
And those are very human
impulses and developments.

2271
02:01:14,591 --> 02:01:16,240
And so when you have somebody who decides,

2272
02:01:16,241 --> 02:01:21,040
I'm going to follow my appetites and I'm
just going to fuck and be a real slot

2273
02:01:21,070 --> 02:01:25,600
or a real, you know, a real dirt bag,
whatever, these are the words people use,

2274
02:01:25,930 --> 02:01:30,190
I think we all go though, all of us
rightly in some ways go, well that's,

2275
02:01:30,191 --> 02:01:33,880
that's really indulging your appetites
and nobody can sustain that because

2276
02:01:33,881 --> 02:01:37,840
actually what leads to
that kind of behavior isn't
necessarily anything positive.

2277
02:01:37,841 --> 02:01:40,020
You're certainly not
going to develop a right,

2278
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:43,880
you know, you're still generally
considered unsavory. It's, it's,

2279
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:45,950
it's base behavior.

2280
02:01:45,951 --> 02:01:49,700
It's giving in completely to the beast
and a lot of people that supported our

2281
02:01:49,701 --> 02:01:52,850
freaks. That's right. Other
fellow freaks. We're all freaks.

2282
02:01:53,190 --> 02:01:56,720
If we weren't freaks then, then
youtube and I mean red tube and, and,

2283
02:01:56,721 --> 02:02:00,770
and all these things important wouldn't
be a multibillion dollar industry. But,

2284
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:05,540
but you, you, you have that
we have a culture that's
obsessed with purity. I mean,

2285
02:02:05,541 --> 02:02:07,610
this Anthony Wiener thing,
it's obsessed with it.

2286
02:02:07,611 --> 02:02:12,611
The guy had to resign for
sending a picture of is
thinly clad package to go to a

2287
02:02:12,861 --> 02:02:16,580
coed. Wow. Wow. You
know, it's very strange.

2288
02:02:16,581 --> 02:02:18,450
But what do you think leads to what,

2289
02:02:18,451 --> 02:02:23,300
what purpose does that addiction have
in, in human beings? Why do we have that?

2290
02:02:23,301 --> 02:02:27,020
Why does it exist? Why is there this weird
thing that makes us fixate on things?

2291
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:30,890
I know that there's a book I read
called the selfish gene. I know that,

2292
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:33,710
that a scientist, um, I
can't remember who wrote it,

2293
02:02:33,711 --> 02:02:36,200
but I know that a scientist would,
um,

2294
02:02:36,590 --> 02:02:41,590
would suggest that genetic variation
has both ends of the spectrum.

2295
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:47,290
So you have to sort of have, um,
the need for sex is very strong in,

2296
02:02:47,291 --> 02:02:48,170
in human beings.

2297
02:02:48,171 --> 02:02:52,700
And I would imagine that you have examples
of people who have a very strong sex

2298
02:02:52,701 --> 02:02:56,090
drive and they're on one side of the
spectrum and other people that are asexual

2299
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:59,390
and it just probably, you can chalk it
up to hormones or whatever it might be,

2300
02:02:59,391 --> 02:03:02,990
but I don't even necessarily mean
sexual. Uh, I, I just mean why,

2301
02:03:03,190 --> 02:03:07,370
what is this proclivity for addiction
that people have for compulsive behavior

2302
02:03:07,371 --> 02:03:11,720
for or impulsive behavior rather than
male couples have an impulse maybe. Maybe.

2303
02:03:11,721 --> 02:03:14,260
First of all, it's they're
trying to fill a void, right?

2304
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:17,840
You're trying to feel something.
I think it comes down to the juice.

2305
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:21,770
Do you think it's because we don't
live hunter gatherer lives safe?

2306
02:03:21,930 --> 02:03:22,763
I was going to say,

2307
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:26,960
I was going to say that I think when you
have to track down a deer and kill it

2308
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:30,040
and that requires extreme behavior.
And in some ways I mean it,

2309
02:03:30,170 --> 02:03:34,030
it requires adrenaline.
It requires endurance,

2310
02:03:34,031 --> 02:03:38,960
it requires a supreme
aggression. You, when you kill
an animal, like the, you know,

2311
02:03:38,961 --> 02:03:41,870
we came up millennia killing
animals with a spear or a boner,

2312
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:46,550
you smell that blood, you have to skin
it, you're involved in that animal's life.

2313
02:03:46,700 --> 02:03:47,151
And I,

2314
02:03:47,151 --> 02:03:51,770
I would imagine that the activity
of hunting on that level it takes,

2315
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:55,610
it's a huge rush.
It's why people get addicted to war.

2316
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:59,480
So you think there's like some sort of
a gap and then there the average person

2317
02:03:59,481 --> 02:04:03,800
working a nine to five existence with
some sort of stayed behavior pattern that

2318
02:04:03,801 --> 02:04:07,430
they have to follow throughout the day
that these people have like a hole that

2319
02:04:07,431 --> 02:04:08,500
needs to be filled?
No,

2320
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:13,250
the porn comes in or drugs come in
or there's no guessing come in. Yeah,

2321
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:16,970
that's what he does because we have
a lot of needs. And I think one is,

2322
02:04:16,971 --> 02:04:20,510
and by the way, I'll tell you what
needed probably fills. We have needs.

2323
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:22,310
We have a need for certain certainty.

2324
02:04:22,311 --> 02:04:24,620
We have a need to feel like I
know where my paychecks coming.

2325
02:04:24,621 --> 02:04:28,310
I got a room full of men. I think we have
a need to connect with people, you know.

2326
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:32,330
But we also have a need a lot of that
behavior. When you gamble, look at it.

2327
02:04:32,540 --> 02:04:32,930
When you,

2328
02:04:32,930 --> 02:04:36,230
when you show up in a room and six girls
you've never met are there to fuck you

2329
02:04:36,231 --> 02:04:38,220
or that you don't even know what
they look like and your heart's

2330
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:41,790
beating. You know what? You're really
responding to adventure, uncertainty.

2331
02:04:41,910 --> 02:04:44,400
The need to not know what's coming next.

2332
02:04:44,730 --> 02:04:47,400
And human beings have a very deep need to,

2333
02:04:47,450 --> 02:04:49,470
to put themselves into the unpredictable,

2334
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:52,460
just as much as they have a need
to be in the predictable bit.

2335
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:54,560
But if you look at somebody
who doesn't have anything that,

2336
02:04:54,561 --> 02:04:59,020
that unpredictable in their lives, what
happens? They get fucking bored. It's,

2337
02:04:59,030 --> 02:05:03,150
it's why when you make all the money
in the world and you've done it all,

2338
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:07,600
a lot of people get a sense
of loss because there's no
longer that feeling like,

2339
02:05:07,630 --> 02:05:11,400
like Zoros a mountains to climb. Yeah,
well, sorrows. The guy who, the rich,

2340
02:05:11,401 --> 02:05:15,690
the multimillionaire, billionaire
guy, he was a, uh, I think,

2341
02:05:15,691 --> 02:05:19,890
I believe as a Jewish refugee and
it was 15 or 13 years old. Um, uh,

2342
02:05:19,891 --> 02:05:22,800
and hunger as a Jew, as a Jew.
And he was hiding from the Nazis,

2343
02:05:22,801 --> 02:05:26,200
meaning I have to hide from the Nazis and
a otherwise he was going to be killed.

2344
02:05:26,201 --> 02:05:30,950
And, and he, he said, um, that in many
ways those were the most exciting, as,

2345
02:05:30,951 --> 02:05:32,730
as terrifying and horrible times.

2346
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,150
They were also the times he felt the most
alive because he didn't know if he was

2347
02:05:36,151 --> 02:05:38,940
going to make it till tomorrow. And,
and human beings I think have a very,

2348
02:05:38,941 --> 02:05:43,640
very deep, deep need to be put
in the unpredictable. And, and,

2349
02:05:43,641 --> 02:05:44,474
and there is,

2350
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:48,030
there's a way to do that that's positive
and there's a way to do that that's

2351
02:05:48,031 --> 02:05:49,860
negative. And as you get older, like I am,

2352
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:54,350
you start to realize that
going to orgies, um, um, uh,

2353
02:05:54,351 --> 02:05:58,080
and that kind of stuff,
gambling, those are not positive.

2354
02:05:58,081 --> 02:06:01,920
They're not necessarily positive things
to do you because you pay a price for

2355
02:06:01,921 --> 02:06:04,650
them in some ways.
If you become a sex addict and you're,

2356
02:06:04,710 --> 02:06:06,600
you're chasing skirt all the time,

2357
02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:11,690
you're going to pay a price in connection
and intimacy, I believe. Yeah. Um, um,

2358
02:06:11,990 --> 02:06:15,000
I, I've had to confront that in myself
and I've had to deal with that on, on,

2359
02:06:15,001 --> 02:06:19,130
on a personal level. And so you don't
get away with anything in the world. You,

2360
02:06:19,131 --> 02:06:22,470
you, you, and, and the best way to do it
is not to be too strict with yourself,

2361
02:06:22,710 --> 02:06:26,160
to fucking be forgiving of yourself
and others to realize that we are all

2362
02:06:26,161 --> 02:06:28,950
hanging on by a thread in
one way or another. You know,

2363
02:06:28,951 --> 02:06:32,460
I've watched really good people try to
quit smoking and they can't fucking do it.

2364
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:34,950
You can call it, you can tell
them they have weak character,

2365
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:36,570
but I don't choose to believe that.

2366
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:40,500
I believe that they're just fucking
week like all of us in one area.

2367
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:45,450
Weakness, courage, intelligence, these
are all compartmentalized skills,

2368
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:49,350
compartmentalized virtues.
Uh, nobody is, you know,

2369
02:06:49,351 --> 02:06:51,120
very few people are sober
all the way through.

2370
02:06:51,121 --> 02:06:53,520
And if you are sober all the way
through and you don't have any vices,

2371
02:06:53,550 --> 02:06:55,800
you might be fucking too
boring for me to hang out.

2372
02:06:55,801 --> 02:07:00,180
Want to know what doctor Drew's vices
are cause he know he's got them. Well,

2373
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:01,830
and you know,
a lot of doctors though,

2374
02:07:01,831 --> 02:07:05,070
doctors I'd noticed tend to be
very sober individuals. I agree,

2375
02:07:05,071 --> 02:07:07,350
but I wouldn't want to go home. They
can doctor drew, how about that?

2376
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:12,480
I would tell them how it would second
hand smoke funnel ticket in his brain.

2377
02:07:13,110 --> 02:07:13,630
But when,

2378
02:07:13,630 --> 02:07:17,190
when you see a guy who was constantly
around people who are fucking up left and

2379
02:07:17,191 --> 02:07:21,720
right, but yet he and his life is like
very together, very together family that,

2380
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:24,570
that, that, but then that's, that's
part of his, what makes him feel,

2381
02:07:24,571 --> 02:07:26,190
but that's a positive addiction.
That's,

2382
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:29,790
I mean doctor truth always
challenged with a new person.

2383
02:07:29,791 --> 02:07:33,300
He's going to try to help. He's trying,
doctor spends his life solving problems.

2384
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:36,070
Cousin Nate. Yeah. Not only does
he do that, but he's always on

2385
02:07:36,470 --> 02:07:40,510
the love line show as well. People don't
realize he's still got that radio show.

2386
02:07:40,670 --> 02:07:44,710
So every day, every day.
It really does help people.

2387
02:07:44,711 --> 02:07:47,350
I mean he really got us to a out and
needed advice and I don't think he's

2388
02:07:47,351 --> 02:07:49,360
helping those celebrities.
I mean you can say they are,

2389
02:07:49,361 --> 02:07:51,670
but those dudes need a paycheck.
I mean,

2390
02:07:51,671 --> 02:07:55,470
I guess any possible treatment and maybe
maybe the idea of shocking them and

2391
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:58,810
putting it into the public law actually.
Yeah.

2392
02:07:58,811 --> 02:08:01,490
Maybe putting him in the public eye
actually puts more pressure on them and it

2393
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:04,360
actually makes it more real.
I'm fascinated with,

2394
02:08:04,361 --> 02:08:07,340
with this notion of what
discipline really means and what,

2395
02:08:07,341 --> 02:08:09,790
what self restriction really
comes down and you know, what,

2396
02:08:09,791 --> 02:08:14,470
what impulsiveness is worth
and how much is dynamic, crazy,

2397
02:08:14,471 --> 02:08:18,580
unpredictable behavior worth in a, in
the dynamic of a machine. You know,

2398
02:08:18,581 --> 02:08:20,080
because the human being,
you look,

2399
02:08:20,110 --> 02:08:23,080
look at a human being in the
context of being a unit and there's,

2400
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:26,590
there's qualities that I appreciate and
one of the qualities I like impulsive

2401
02:08:26,591 --> 02:08:30,580
people. I like wildness. No,
all my friends are impulsive.
All my friends are crazy.

2402
02:08:30,690 --> 02:08:33,950
Me Too. You know, it's more, it's more
color. It's fun to be around. Yeah.

2403
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:37,180
I mean we've talked about Jimmy Burke.
Joey Diaz is a perfect example.

2404
02:08:37,181 --> 02:08:39,880
You're a perfect example, you know,
to other people. I'm an example.

2405
02:08:39,881 --> 02:08:44,320
It's like we're all kind of the most
fun people I know are all pretty fucking

2406
02:08:44,321 --> 02:08:46,230
crazy. Yeah. You know, I mean you,

2407
02:08:46,231 --> 02:08:50,710
you don't get interesting and
funny without those weird sorta.

2408
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:53,840
I agree. And I like to hold
onto a lot of my impulses.

2409
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:58,510
I like to hold onto a lot of my, whatever
you would call the beast and the flesh.

2410
02:08:58,511 --> 02:09:00,700
I mean,
I do think that there's a,

2411
02:09:00,710 --> 02:09:02,800
there's something beautiful
about learning how to be in,

2412
02:09:02,801 --> 02:09:06,010
can total control of yourself,
of your appetites and everything else.

2413
02:09:06,011 --> 02:09:08,590
I think that is a virtue and I think
that's something people as adults,

2414
02:09:08,591 --> 02:09:10,760
as you get older, should strive for. Um,

2415
02:09:10,970 --> 02:09:14,500
but I also think that I don't want
to lose all my, uh, all my crates,

2416
02:09:14,501 --> 02:09:16,660
especially as an artist,
especially as in the chair,

2417
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:20,200
you needed to be forward to
the wildest moments on stage.

2418
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:22,600
You're letting people know when
those wildest moments like,

2419
02:09:22,601 --> 02:09:25,900
I've been to this crazy place.
That's why I'm a standup comic.

2420
02:09:25,901 --> 02:09:28,420
I get up on stage and try to make
people laugh. It's called look at me.

2421
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:31,070
There's a whole line I'm
trying to fill in all or not.

2422
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:33,880
I don't want to lose that
whole, I really don't. I mean,

2423
02:09:33,881 --> 02:09:36,760
you ever see a really good actor.
They're uh, they're basket cases,

2424
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:41,290
they're fucking basket cases. The key is
to be that basket case, but to be happy.

2425
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:42,520
And as a comic goods,

2426
02:09:42,550 --> 02:09:45,910
there's a dance and it is possible
and it's possible to put your,

2427
02:09:45,911 --> 02:09:50,911
your balance in the correct way so that
you still are energetic and enthusiastic

2428
02:09:51,431 --> 02:09:52,150
and creative.

2429
02:09:52,150 --> 02:09:56,500
But yet you still have that there's a
part of your brain that will flip over to

2430
02:09:56,501 --> 02:09:59,730
the dark side. You just gotta be able to
control it. Well and, and you know, but,

2431
02:09:59,830 --> 02:10:00,641
but let me tell you something,

2432
02:10:00,641 --> 02:10:04,360
when you start talking in terms of I
better learn how to control it. You know,

2433
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:07,960
that's not how people are.
That's not how people control themselves.

2434
02:10:07,970 --> 02:10:10,780
The minute you start saying things like,
I can't do that. Not gonna do that.

2435
02:10:10,781 --> 02:10:12,910
Like I was doing with that,
with that hotel room. Right.

2436
02:10:12,911 --> 02:10:15,610
I'm not going to go up there and fuck
those six girls cause it's, it's wrong.

2437
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,620
That doesn't work for me. That's
not going to work for me. Well,

2438
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:21,130
what does work well,
I think you need a different car.

2439
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:23,440
You either need a different
kind of philosophy.

2440
02:10:23,441 --> 02:10:26,230
But I think more importantly when it
comes to dealing with an addiction,

2441
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:29,500
I think you've got a substitute.
I think you've got to associate,

2442
02:10:29,501 --> 02:10:32,590
you got to figure out a way to associate
that behavior with nothing positive.

2443
02:10:32,620 --> 02:10:33,980
And, and, and you've got to be able to

2444
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:36,830
associate a different kind of behavior
with something that's more pleasurable

2445
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:40,670
because it was, anytime you do that and
add in any addict counseling, right?

2446
02:10:40,671 --> 02:10:43,910
They tried to get you to replace her
addiction with, you know, start gardening,

2447
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:46,190
get obsessed with something.
It's gotta be something fun.

2448
02:10:46,191 --> 02:10:48,770
It's like when I tell people that, I know
that people that don't work out okay,

2449
02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:51,500
and I noticed that they just
can't work out. And what they,

2450
02:10:51,501 --> 02:10:53,630
what they get tired the minute you
start talking about you've got to start

2451
02:10:53,631 --> 02:10:56,420
eating better and look at them, you
guys. Yeah, yeah, because you go,

2452
02:10:56,421 --> 02:10:58,550
you got to start eating better and
you've got to start working out what they

2453
02:10:58,551 --> 02:10:59,810
think is,
I got my God.

2454
02:10:59,811 --> 02:11:04,240
That means I'm going to have to sweat in
a gym and I got to know what all I want

2455
02:11:04,241 --> 02:11:08,870
to do is show you very gently and slowly
how much better you feel when you are

2456
02:11:08,871 --> 02:11:11,840
in shape versus when you're not.
And once you feel the difference,

2457
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:15,620
you will slowly start to go to that.
And when you go back to your old habits,

2458
02:11:15,621 --> 02:11:17,970
you'll go, damn, I don't
feel as good as I did. I,

2459
02:11:17,980 --> 02:11:20,960
I gotta I gotta do something here and
you'll try to get out of that state.

2460
02:11:21,170 --> 02:11:25,040
It's the only way I think people really
change. I really, I really believe that.

2461
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:26,780
I don't think you change
with a gun to your head.

2462
02:11:26,781 --> 02:11:28,520
I think real change happens when you,

2463
02:11:28,610 --> 02:11:32,750
when you see and understand the
difference and, and, and that that can be,

2464
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:37,900
that can be taken to I think movements
like w like al-Qaeda's movement,

2465
02:11:38,631 --> 02:11:43,120
that's Muslim fundamentalism.
When you show them a really
interesting program, uh,

2466
02:11:43,130 --> 02:11:43,401
in,

2467
02:11:43,401 --> 02:11:48,350
in Yemen where they take
these young idealistic al
Qaeda guys and they get these

2468
02:11:48,710 --> 02:11:50,300
Muslim scholars in a room.

2469
02:11:50,301 --> 02:11:54,170
These like really kind of like smart guys
who've been around older guys and they

2470
02:11:54,171 --> 02:11:56,750
debate them, they challenge
him to a debate and they go,

2471
02:11:56,751 --> 02:11:59,330
what are your ideas on Islam?
You're on Islamic fundamentalism,

2472
02:11:59,331 --> 02:12:02,390
you love the Quran.
Let's have a talk since I'm any month,

2473
02:12:02,450 --> 02:12:05,540
I've been doing this for 50 years.
What are your ideas?

2474
02:12:05,541 --> 02:12:10,430
And they just dismantle their ideas
mentally. And a lot of these guys just go,

2475
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:13,070
I didn't know any of that. I've been fed
this kind of thing. And they're like,

2476
02:12:13,071 --> 02:12:14,090
well this is how it is.

2477
02:12:14,091 --> 02:12:17,000
And let me show you the examples in the
Quran and all of a sudden they go and

2478
02:12:17,001 --> 02:12:18,050
their minds change.

2479
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:21,740
And if you want to change what you're
saying is you need to go to the Muslim

2480
02:12:21,741 --> 02:12:25,380
religion, you'll stop beating
off and fucking whores in
a hotel. Well, well, well,

2481
02:12:25,381 --> 02:12:29,960
well, well religion, whether
it's Christianity, Muslim,
Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism,

2482
02:12:29,961 --> 02:12:34,370
Ken can serve that function and has
for many addicts and as a really a real

2483
02:12:34,371 --> 02:12:37,010
place for people to kind of live.
They go with the 12 step program.

2484
02:12:37,300 --> 02:12:40,190
One of the reasons why it works is that
you submit to a higher power. Exactly.

2485
02:12:40,191 --> 02:12:41,180
It sounds ridiculous,

2486
02:12:41,181 --> 02:12:44,630
but as a tool is a mental tool using
it as an operating system that you,

2487
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:48,200
you're going to operate your mind under
the confines of this Christianity. Look,

2488
02:12:48,201 --> 02:12:51,260
man, I've 0.0 system. The
biggest, the biggest thing,

2489
02:12:51,261 --> 02:12:53,580
the biggest problem we have
in some ways and, and the,

2490
02:12:53,610 --> 02:12:55,790
the worst thing that artists
can do for themselves as to say,

2491
02:12:55,791 --> 02:12:59,600
I'm all my genius comes right out of me.
It's,

2492
02:12:59,601 --> 02:13:03,920
it takes a lot of pressure off you as a
creative person or a person in general

2493
02:13:03,921 --> 02:13:08,390
to say, you know what? I'm not perfect.
I'm going to let something else guide me.

2494
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:10,680
I'm going to let something. Um,
so if you're an artist, he's,

2495
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:12,920
I'm like Flannery O'connor,
that wonderful thing. She goes,

2496
02:13:12,921 --> 02:13:14,480
I don't sit at my
typewriter to write at all.

2497
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:17,980
I just sit at my typewriter and I sit
there in case something happens and it's

2498
02:13:17,981 --> 02:13:20,700
something starts working its way
through me. I'll start typing. Right?

2499
02:13:20,701 --> 02:13:24,670
But the pressure off you cynical people
will look at like Pressfield's book like

2500
02:13:24,750 --> 02:13:29,180
the war and they'll go, well,
this is poppy cock. That's
fine nonsense. That's fine.

2501
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:31,980
But it's not effective. It is.
If what people don't understand

2502
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,790
it, and it may be incorrect, it may be
all within the confines of your mind,

2503
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:39,420
but if you operate on the principle that
you are enacting the muse that you were

2504
02:13:39,421 --> 02:13:42,900
contacting the muse, then it really
does work. Ken, can I, can I,

2505
02:13:42,901 --> 02:13:46,710
can I Sinek kind of Cynak explained to
me why when I hear a piece of music I

2506
02:13:46,711 --> 02:13:48,690
start crying because it's so beautiful.

2507
02:13:48,990 --> 02:13:51,150
Can you explain
mathematically how that goes?

2508
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:54,210
I'm not interested at all I know is I
start crying because it's beautiful.

2509
02:13:54,930 --> 02:13:58,970
A lot of things that cannot be explained
what it does, laws fires me. I hear,

2510
02:13:58,990 --> 02:14:02,630
I hear like a beautiful piece of music.
You know why I got into standup?

2511
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:05,600
I remember when I got to stand up after
I heard your album and that Voodoo

2512
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:09,180
Punani song and all that stuff and I'm
a seriously, and I went home that day.

2513
02:14:09,330 --> 02:14:11,090
So you don't know this. I
never told you this. I'm, it's,

2514
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:14,940
I'm glad I'm talking about this because
I listened to your album and I had to

2515
02:14:14,941 --> 02:14:18,120
leave early. I got out of there and
you couldn't, and you got mad at me.

2516
02:14:18,121 --> 02:14:21,060
You call me, I'm gonna go. You just
left without saying by just took off.

2517
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:22,440
You know why I took off?

2518
02:14:22,590 --> 02:14:26,820
I couldn't handle being around you
because I was so not only inspired,

2519
02:14:26,970 --> 02:14:31,470
but I went, my friends doing something
really special here and I have,

2520
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:33,990
I know I have something in me
and I'm not living up to it.

2521
02:14:33,991 --> 02:14:35,890
And being around him has reminded me of,

2522
02:14:36,030 --> 02:14:38,250
of the fact that I'm not
living my fucking life.

2523
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:41,610
And I remember you called me real mad and
I made up some excuse. Like, I was like,

2524
02:14:41,820 --> 02:14:44,310
I started telling you like some
excuse and then I went, dude,

2525
02:14:44,311 --> 02:14:47,610
I gotta be honest with you. I, you
fucked me up a little bit. I said,

2526
02:14:47,611 --> 02:14:51,600
that song and that, that your
jokes were so on inspiring to me.

2527
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:55,890
And I went home and I started writing.
And so that's what happened to me.

2528
02:14:55,891 --> 02:14:57,450
That was a huge catalyst for me.

2529
02:14:57,480 --> 02:15:00,360
I went home and started writing because
after I heard that song and after I

2530
02:15:00,361 --> 02:15:03,320
heard those fucking jokes, you would
come to those, God damn you're judge.

2531
02:15:03,321 --> 02:15:07,170
This was I don't know how many years ago.
They were so fucking well formed.

2532
02:15:07,171 --> 02:15:09,300
You were such a title wave.

2533
02:15:09,510 --> 02:15:12,810
It was like an example for the first
time where I went, I saw an artist,

2534
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:17,700
so just peak come together and just put
out the power you putting out with so

2535
02:15:17,701 --> 02:15:21,000
retarded that it was changing.
It was changing the whole fucking room.

2536
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:23,910
People were like, what the fuck
this guy's writing songs he's doing.

2537
02:15:24,330 --> 02:15:27,180
And I remember going, I got to taste
some of that. I got to have some of that.

2538
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:30,690
I've got to get the fuck out of here. I
get that stuff. That's what you need, man.

2539
02:15:30,750 --> 02:15:32,820
And if you don't have that in your life,
you've got to find it.

2540
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:37,800
Either surround yourself with friends
who do it, go go to ted.com do what?

2541
02:15:37,830 --> 02:15:40,530
Do whatever you have to do,
man. Find it. It's out there.

2542
02:15:40,531 --> 02:15:43,260
And the beautiful thing about the
technology and this is for young people,

2543
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:48,440
is that you can spend your time listening
to music and reading about what Lady

2544
02:15:48,650 --> 02:15:49,410
Gaga Ward or the gym,

2545
02:15:49,410 --> 02:15:53,460
or you can fucking open your mind to a
whole world out there that is going to

2546
02:15:53,461 --> 02:15:56,070
bite you in the ass if you're
not ready for it anyway.

2547
02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:58,380
So start opening your
mind and start reading.

2548
02:15:58,410 --> 02:16:02,100
And it's important to not give in a
jealousy when you see someone doing

2549
02:16:02,101 --> 02:16:06,570
something that you're not doing and you
feel like, fuck, I'm not doing. There's a,

2550
02:16:06,571 --> 02:16:10,710
there's an instinct to protect yourself
by bullshitting yourself and becoming

2551
02:16:10,711 --> 02:16:13,590
jealous and bitter and talking
shit about that person.

2552
02:16:13,591 --> 02:16:14,820
And that's where haters come from.

2553
02:16:14,970 --> 02:16:19,970
What haters are 100% of all haters in
the world are unrealized potential.

2554
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:23,700
It's 100% accurate. I'm not a hater.
I'm, I'm a, I'm a pretty nice guy.

2555
02:16:23,730 --> 02:16:26,820
Easy going guy. It's because
I'm successful. Well,

2556
02:16:26,821 --> 02:16:29,350
when like Michael Jordan's not a hater,
you know what I'm saying? I mean,

2557
02:16:29,351 --> 02:16:31,990
you know what I mean? I mean like
when you get to a guy at that level,

2558
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:36,490
they're not haters that the real haters
are and they see someone doing well and

2559
02:16:36,491 --> 02:16:39,250
it bothers them to a person like
a Michael Jordan or a winner.

2560
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:43,690
They see someone doing well and it
inspires them to take it up another notch.

2561
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:48,610
I've always, I've always, always
tried to look at things like that.

2562
02:16:48,611 --> 02:16:51,370
When you see something great and if
it's a friend of yours, there's nothing.

2563
02:16:51,790 --> 02:16:53,830
You have to use it as inspiration.

2564
02:16:53,860 --> 02:16:57,580
It's supposed to inspire
you and haters and,

2565
02:16:57,581 --> 02:17:01,360
and that notion is a, is is what that
is, is it's a skewed perspective.

2566
02:17:01,361 --> 02:17:04,510
I think what happens is a lot of
times they say, well, you know what?

2567
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:07,320
There is scarcity in the world,
so there's only a,

2568
02:17:07,450 --> 02:17:11,260
there's only a certain size of the pie.

2569
02:17:11,590 --> 02:17:14,740
And if you're doing this, you've taken up
all the pie and there's no room for me.

2570
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:19,000
Not True Man, not at all. There is no
scarcity in tangible way of thanking you,

2571
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:23,140
open yourself up to something beautiful
and great and let that work through you

2572
02:17:23,141 --> 02:17:26,500
and really be effective. Be
astonished by it. Be scared by it.

2573
02:17:26,780 --> 02:17:31,420
DPP be brought to your knees by it.
Whatever it takes you will,

2574
02:17:31,421 --> 02:17:36,340
you will find way more strength in
that surrender to, to the beautiful.

2575
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:40,240
Then you will when you close
yourself off. And all of us, man,

2576
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:43,630
all of us had this notion to go,
I'm closing myself off. Fuck this.

2577
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:47,530
Everybody wants to win the lottery,
but the lottery will fucking ruin you.

2578
02:17:47,650 --> 02:17:49,990
You have to earn the whole thing.

2579
02:17:49,991 --> 02:17:53,320
In order to be a real man or a real woman,

2580
02:17:53,410 --> 02:17:57,550
you have to earn the whole thing.
And the crazy thing is to be the man.

2581
02:17:57,551 --> 02:17:59,350
To get to that point,
to be the man,

2582
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:04,210
you literally have to not ever be possibly
the man because you have to get to

2583
02:18:04,211 --> 02:18:07,600
the zen state where there is no the man.
It's all about the work.

2584
02:18:07,601 --> 02:18:11,170
It's all about what, what genius you're
putting out is all about whatever,

2585
02:18:11,230 --> 02:18:14,140
whether it's music or whether it's
writing or whatever the fuck it is.

2586
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:18,670
It's all about finding that real pure
place. So there is never the man,

2587
02:18:18,730 --> 02:18:21,430
that's when the muse kicks
in. The idea of this, I,

2588
02:18:21,431 --> 02:18:23,260
this all comes from somewhere else.

2589
02:18:23,380 --> 02:18:28,380
It's like maybe it is just an attitude
that allows you to bypass the ego.

2590
02:18:29,170 --> 02:18:30,700
Maybe that's what the Muse is.

2591
02:18:30,790 --> 02:18:35,620
It's just a scientific or a method of
thinking that allows you to bypass the

2592
02:18:35,621 --> 02:18:39,520
ego. It's effective, whatever. It
is very effective. And I think also,

2593
02:18:39,521 --> 02:18:42,050
and so you're never the man, you
never feel like the man, well,

2594
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:44,830
you're bringing me to like the
notion of celebrity for example.

2595
02:18:44,831 --> 02:18:48,100
That's a really good point because
celebrity actually doesn't exist. Like,

2596
02:18:48,101 --> 02:18:51,460
like you've had celebrity for a long
time. But like just with me now, things,

2597
02:18:51,461 --> 02:18:53,210
you know, things were
starting to, you know, you,

2598
02:18:53,270 --> 02:18:56,470
I go to places and people recognize
you and they want to take pictures or

2599
02:18:56,471 --> 02:18:58,330
whatever and, and you
think to yourself, well,

2600
02:18:58,380 --> 02:19:00,730
I'm doing this TV show and I'm doing,
it wasn't,

2601
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:03,970
and I guess in some ways I'm making
lots of money and I've kind of arrived a

2602
02:19:03,971 --> 02:19:05,620
little bit. I mean, I'm
kind of like, you know,

2603
02:19:05,621 --> 02:19:10,510
I'm a working actor and there
is zero difference actually in,

2604
02:19:10,750 --> 02:19:15,190
in uh, what it takes for me to
keep myself inspired. And if,

2605
02:19:15,191 --> 02:19:17,470
if anything that's nice,
it's a nice thing,

2606
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:21,490
but it certainly plays no real
part in my overall fulfillment,

2607
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:25,060
which is really interesting. You know,
and I, you know this really well. I mean,

2608
02:19:25,061 --> 02:19:26,350
you know,
I've been with you in Vegas.

2609
02:19:26,790 --> 02:19:28,370
I remember what the height
of fear factor when,

2610
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:32,120
I mean you had to literally go to the
corner and rub your eyes because they're,

2611
02:19:32,130 --> 02:19:34,370
they, everybody would take, they
just, everybody wanted a picture.

2612
02:19:34,371 --> 02:19:37,880
I really want to touch. Everybody
wanted to be around you. That doesn't,

2613
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:41,750
that becomes, I guess
in a lot of ways, um,

2614
02:19:42,410 --> 02:19:45,950
the exact opposite of what you're
going for. It's a privilege. It's nice,

2615
02:19:45,951 --> 02:19:49,700
but it's actually a distraction.
It's actually not. It doesn't,

2616
02:19:49,701 --> 02:19:53,480
it actually doesn't exist. It
doesn't exist, but it does. It does.

2617
02:19:53,481 --> 02:19:56,450
I just mean it does. Something he
has to deal with is, yeah, it exists.

2618
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:58,790
But it is weird.
What I mean?

2619
02:19:58,791 --> 02:20:01,820
Is that what you think celebrity is going
to be and then what it actually ends

2620
02:20:01,821 --> 02:20:04,770
up being two totally different things.
Yeah. That's all. That's all it is.

2621
02:20:04,771 --> 02:20:08,030
That there is a dance that you have to
do to in order to not get sucked into the

2622
02:20:08,031 --> 02:20:10,400
wave, not get sucked into
the gravity of the situation.

2623
02:20:10,401 --> 02:20:15,180
Don't believe it or buy into it.
You know, some people never do know.

2624
02:20:15,290 --> 02:20:19,430
Brian, you've inspired people. This
was a good podcast and you know,

2625
02:20:19,431 --> 02:20:21,980
I've talked to so many people and I talked
to a lot of them this weekend we did

2626
02:20:21,981 --> 02:20:25,450
a the Irvine Improv and there
was a lot of fun and uh,

2627
02:20:25,540 --> 02:20:29,150
we talked to a lot of people that are
podcast fans. And one of the things,

2628
02:20:29,151 --> 02:20:31,740
the number one thing that keeps
coming up as these people say that it,

2629
02:20:31,970 --> 02:20:33,740
first of all,
a lot of people listen to it at work.

2630
02:20:33,830 --> 02:20:34,790
They listen to what they're doing,

2631
02:20:34,791 --> 02:20:37,400
stupid shit that they don't like doing
and they just love the fact there's

2632
02:20:37,401 --> 02:20:38,870
something like this out there.
And two,

2633
02:20:38,871 --> 02:20:42,070
they say it gives them an opportunity
to look at things completely different.

2634
02:20:42,090 --> 02:20:44,690
It's shaping the way
people think. Man, there's,

2635
02:20:44,740 --> 02:20:48,210
there's a difference between
what we're doing here. Then the,

2636
02:20:48,330 --> 02:20:51,860
the sort of the average radio show and
the average podcast is we're not afraid

2637
02:20:51,861 --> 02:20:56,000
to talk about weird deep shit and go and,
and because of that,

2638
02:20:56,030 --> 02:21:00,620
it's allowing other people to consider
possibilities and ways of thinking that I

2639
02:21:00,621 --> 02:21:01,490
don't think they would have.

2640
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:06,590
Like it's a privilege and
I know the privilege for me
to man, it's all, you know,

2641
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:09,020
it's great to be on the podcast.
It's, it's, it's, you know,

2642
02:21:09,021 --> 02:21:11,150
and I have people come up to me
all the time now. That's amazing.

2643
02:21:11,151 --> 02:21:13,880
I'm going to give a little while listening
to this thing right away. I'll be it.

2644
02:21:13,910 --> 02:21:17,010
I'll be at the, uh, San Francisco
Punch line. Have you done that?

2645
02:21:17,020 --> 02:21:20,960
Punchline is great.
I'll be there on August 10th to the 13th.

2646
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:24,570
That's my birthday. The 11th it is. Yeah.
I'm going to call you ever done that,

2647
02:21:24,830 --> 02:21:28,340
that happy birthday. It's
amazing. It's a great, great club.

2648
02:21:28,341 --> 02:21:31,880
It's one of the best clubs. It's a
perfect height. It's one of those places.

2649
02:21:31,881 --> 02:21:34,130
It's got the low ceilings.
It's tight.

2650
02:21:34,340 --> 02:21:39,320
I think it seats probably two
5,300 and now it's perfect.

2651
02:21:39,470 --> 02:21:40,460
I can't wear a dude.

2652
02:21:40,461 --> 02:21:43,910
I was just in San Francisco recently
and God gave me a Bill Hicks last live

2653
02:21:43,911 --> 02:21:47,150
performance at the punchline of last time
I was there and gave it to me on DVD.

2654
02:21:47,180 --> 02:21:49,220
That's what's so amazing about
being a comic, because you get to,

2655
02:21:49,221 --> 02:21:52,070
you're performing with such a
history in rooms like that. Oh yeah.

2656
02:21:52,071 --> 02:21:55,160
I'll put one of those. The
punchline. That's one of
those, I'm doing the ice house,

2657
02:21:55,340 --> 02:21:58,010
not this weekend coming up,
but next weekend,

2658
02:21:58,011 --> 02:22:02,660
which is the 22nd and 23rd
the Ice House in Pasadena,

2659
02:22:02,990 --> 02:22:04,970
and that's a small place.
It's gonna sell out quick,

2660
02:22:05,210 --> 02:22:10,160
but that place is the same place
it's been for like 30 plus years,

2661
02:22:10,161 --> 02:22:13,310
man. And there's photos on the
wall of people from the bullies.

2662
02:22:13,340 --> 02:22:17,060
I think it's one of the oldest
comedy clubs in the country.
Yes. Yeah, it is. It is.

2663
02:22:17,090 --> 02:22:19,790
It's just doing the ice house. Come on
down. If you want to do this weekend,

2664
02:22:19,791 --> 02:22:23,420
you want to do it next weekend, come
down to do it. Gets a 22nd and 23rd.

2665
02:22:23,421 --> 02:22:26,150
Come on down, bitch. I'm down.
All right, beautiful. Um,

2666
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:28,530
look, I love you man. You're
the best. Brian Cowen,

2667
02:22:28,590 --> 02:22:33,590
B r y a n c a l l e n on Twitter
and Brian [inaudible] dot com.

2668
02:22:34,770 --> 02:22:38,700
And uh, you already know he's going to
be at the punchline in San Francisco,

2669
02:22:38,701 --> 02:22:41,460
the 10th through the 13th,
which is a fucking awesome club.

2670
02:22:41,461 --> 02:22:44,570
If you're in San Francisco, you think
Brian's funny, deep on the podcast,

2671
02:22:44,571 --> 02:22:47,100
you got to see a stand up. You're
standing up has come. I mean,

2672
02:22:47,101 --> 02:22:49,770
I remember when you were doing
that alternative bullshit
just standing up there

2673
02:22:49,771 --> 02:22:52,830
with your hands in your pockets and
your fucking crushing it now, man.

2674
02:22:52,831 --> 02:22:57,090
It's awesome. It's awesome to see.
Thank you. And um, and that's it.

2675
02:22:57,180 --> 02:22:59,860
You dirty bitches. That's the end
of the podcast for this week. Um,

2676
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:03,720
I got some shit to do and I'm not going
to be around all week. So very busy.

2677
02:23:04,030 --> 02:23:08,970
I've moving and shaking. I'm in a
movie now and I dance. I'm doing. Yeah,

2678
02:23:09,170 --> 02:23:12,740
for tomorrow. So if, if anyone wants
their fixed, I'll be doing four live.

2679
02:23:13,090 --> 02:23:15,830
Who are you doing them with?
Start off with naughty show with Sam Aaa.

2680
02:23:15,831 --> 02:23:18,700
Then Bobby Lee and Ari
Shaffir at two o'clock.

2681
02:23:18,790 --> 02:23:20,780
I'm going to be a good way to work.
It's going to be a good one.

2682
02:23:20,781 --> 02:23:25,480
Four o'clock Tom Segura ski
and then six o'clock uh,

2683
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:27,730
and then,
okay,

2684
02:23:27,731 --> 02:23:31,870
well try to keep it together for all
those times and don't make a sad face.

2685
02:23:31,871 --> 02:23:35,260
So I'm so tired. Budget,
all of these podcast,

2686
02:23:35,440 --> 02:23:37,120
if you're going to commit
to doing that many podcasts,

2687
02:23:37,121 --> 02:23:39,880
you've would have take some five hour
energy, right? Yeah. Damn right, Baby

2688
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:42,510
Montana. Have you been
there before, by the way?

2689
02:23:42,570 --> 02:23:45,810
Never been on my tab. I haven't last
frontier basically. I'm pretty well.

2690
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:50,580
All right. You dirty freaks. We
love you. We are you. You are us.

2691
02:23:50,670 --> 02:23:55,670
We Are Legion and we love the flashlight
and we do not forget big kisses.

2692
02:23:55,740 --> 02:23:59,190
Go to fleshlight.com excuse

2693
02:24:00,360 --> 02:24:02,580
There's a guy who owns [inaudible]
dot com he wants a lot of money.

2694
02:24:02,730 --> 02:24:04,860
That's the story.
And I'm not willing to give it to him.

2695

2697
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:17,850
We are ironing out all the legal details
when it comes to the Onnit labs. Um,

2698
02:24:17,880 --> 02:24:19,980
uh, new, true genic,

2699
02:24:20,040 --> 02:24:22,950
whatever the fuck it's nootropic
formula for brain pills.

2700
02:24:23,070 --> 02:24:26,970
I don't know exactly why it works,
but it fucking works like a motherfucker.

2701
02:24:27,140 --> 02:24:29,700
There's some nootropic for me,
those are neutral,

2702
02:24:29,701 --> 02:24:32,730
but foremen that were coming out with
that is a, it's very fascinating.

2703
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:36,060
It has a very tangible effect on you
thinking very tangible effect on your

2704
02:24:36,061 --> 02:24:39,600
memory and your energy, your overall
energy during the day. I find myself,

2705
02:24:39,601 --> 02:24:41,850
I take a lot of them when I go on
the road and I don't get tired.

2706
02:24:41,851 --> 02:24:44,970
I'm not as tired as I normally am from
traveling. They're fucking amazing.

2707
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,590
I don't know what's going on. It might be
giving me brand canvasser but sir, sir,

2708
02:24:49,150 --> 02:24:53,400
sir, sir, listen, this fucking show
was over about three minutes ago,

2709
02:24:53,401 --> 02:24:57,150
but I kept going. So good
night and god, speed.
