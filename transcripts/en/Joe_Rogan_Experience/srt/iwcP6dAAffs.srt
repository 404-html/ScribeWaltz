Auditorium in Cleveland.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,070
I'm pretty sure Joey Diaz is doing now
with me.

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,610
He said he wanted to,
I have to confirm,

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,180
but September 9th,
I'm definitely going to be there at the

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:24,481
Masonic Auditorium.
No,

9
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,730
it doesn't mean I had to become a
Freemason,

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,250
but a masonic auditorium.
CLEVELAND,

66
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:54,931
brought to you by ting is the last one.
Ting is the official cell phone,

67
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,710
cell phone,
marble mouth fuck cell phone provider

68
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:03,190
for the podcast ring,
Ting Tang ring

69
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,560
ting is the official cell phone provider
for the podcast.

70
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,940
If you go to rogan.ting.com you can find
out what teaching is all about.

71
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:17,941
With Ting is is a cell phone company
that buys time on the sprint and the

72
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:20,050
t-mobile backbone.
So,

73
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,580
um,
there's two different types of signals

74
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,800
when it comes to cell phones.
There's cdma,

75
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,830
which is verizon and sprint.
And then there's GSM,

76
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,140
which is t mobile and at and T.
And with Ting you don't have to become a

77
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:41,521
part of these big corporations companies
to use their backbone use ting.

78
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,550
And by using ting,
what they call Wah Wah,

79
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,900
you know,
they're slogo makes mobile makes sense.

80
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,780
It actually doesn't make sense.
You save a shit load of money.

81
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,650
If you go to ting,
ill tell you exactly how much you would

82
00:04:56,651 --> 00:05:00,490
say save,
but I believe I'll pull it up here but I

83
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:05,491
think they said the average person,
their bill is here,

84
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:09,130
knows their average bill is $23 a month.

85
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,300
Um,
$440 is the average annual savings per

86
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:16,180
device for a business with 11 to 20
employees.

87
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,620
And again,
you're using sprint,

88
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,540
you're using t-mobile,
using big companies.

89
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,020
If you want to cancel you,
you quit anytime you want.

90
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,190
There's no contracts,
you only pay for what you use as another

91
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,530
beautiful thing.
Like if you use two minutes a month,

92
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,150
that's what you pay for it.
You use a hundred,

93
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:34,630
you pay for a hundred most of the time
you have plans.

94
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,880
Like if you're with a big company and
it's,

95
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:38,830
you get a hundred minutes a month or
whatever you get.

96
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,710
If you go over that,
you have big fees you pay.

97
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,830
If you go under that,
you don't get any money back with ting,

98
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,190
no early cancellation fees,
no early termination fees.

99
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,860
Quit whenever you want.
No ad alongs,

100
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:53,500
no bundled charges,
no fucking weirdness,

101
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:54,850
man.
Real simple,

102
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,070
real easy.
Go to [inaudible] Dot Com and you can

103
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,150
save 25 bucks off of any device or
service.

104
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,240
That's rogan.ting.com and we've done,
this episode is with just me.

105
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,990
I'm alone in a hotel room.
Uh,

106
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:15,380
I was supposed to do an episode with my
pal Duncan Trussell,

107
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,630
but Duncan trussell caught what is being
referred to as the nerd flu.

108
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,690
Um,
apparently when people go to comic con

109
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,600
every year they get what they call the
nerd flu.

110
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,020
And with the nerd flu is,
is people that are like,

111
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,100
I guess either they don't get out much
and when they do get out,

112
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,930
their immune systems are severely
compromised and these fucking bugs just

113
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:43,340
run rampant through this sea of Dorks,
something like that.

114
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,810
Or,
um,

115
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,090
maybe it's just the factor of having so
many people in a room together or so

116
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:53,030
many people in groups together.
I Dunno what the fuck I'm talking about,

117
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,400
but Dunkin sick of shit.
That's my point.

118
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,250
So Dunkin couldn't make it today,
but he will be back on Monday.

119
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,600
So what I did was I,
um,

120
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,680
put up some questions are I've put up a
post on twitter and let people ask me

121
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,160
questions and,
uh,

122
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,240
I answered a few of them.
And so that's this podcast.

123
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,480
I hope you enjoy it.
Please welcome me.

124
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,870
All Right,
ladies and gentlemen.

125
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,930
So I am in a hotel room right now in
Atlanta,

126
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:34,700
Georgia.
And,

127
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,620
uh,
I almost didn't make it to Atlanta.

128
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,960
I almost accidentally went to Chicago.
I've been traveling so much lately.

129
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,340
I literally forgot where I was going.
I don't think you're supposed to say

130
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:47,090
literally there.
Actually,

131
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,900
I actually forgot where I was going.
I went to the,

132
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:53,300
uh,
gate at American Airlines and,

133
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:54,380
uh,
you know,

134
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:57,230
when they call first class,
all the first class people like,

135
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,220
Ooh,
that's me.

136
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,740
Everybody else has to wait.
Well,

137
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,350
that I was one of those assholes and
I've went up to the gate and,

138
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:05,360
uh,
gave the lady my phone,

139
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,360
you know,
because it's a,

140
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,680
it's in your phone.
They scan your phone and she puts it

141
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,514
down.
I go,

142
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,051
she goes,
sir,

143
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:13,970
this is for Atlanta.
And,

144
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:15,440
uh,
I look up and the plane was going to

145
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,930
Chicago and I was like,
oh,

146
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:18,883
dummy.

147
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,623
So,
uh,

148
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,990
that was made,
that was one of those guys in a big rush

149
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:25,880
to get on the plane that I'm not even
supposed to be on.

150
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,560
Uh,
but I made it here.

151
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,470
I love Atlanta.
Atlanta is a bad ass place.

152
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,950
It's a fun town.
Uh,

153
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,450
I did a special here in 2012 and just
always enjoyed it here.

154
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,520
It's a good city.
It's an unusual city.

155
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:38,354
It's very,
uh,

156
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,700
I don't know.
It's got its own thing,

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,550
but a lot of cities are like that.
A lot of cities have their own thing.

158
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,590
Sitting here in my hotel room,
I was going to do a podcast on the plane

159
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,140
and uh,
I put it out on twitter.

160
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,460
I said,
you know,

161
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,350
if you have any questions,
I'll answer them.

162
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,840
And I was thinking about doing it on the
plane because the plane had Wifi,

163
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,500
but there was this lady behind me with
her kid.

164
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,870
Oh my God.
Some people just don't fucking pay

165
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,480
attention to their kid.
They just,

166
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,820
they,
they just don't,

167
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,690
they just don't do anything.
Her kid was going fucking crazy.

168
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:19,170
First of all,
he was kicking the back of my seat

169
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:21,930
constantly,
just kicking it and not like putting his

170
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:24,150
feet up and resting.
Just Som thump,

171
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:24,984
thump,
thump.

172
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,410
He's a cute little guy.
He's a little tiny fellow.

173
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,980
He's probably only maybe two or three at
the most.

174
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,220
And I really liked kids.
Um,

175
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,980
maybe I would have been irritated if I
didn't have kids.

176
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,100
I probably would have been.
But what was irritating was delayed.

177
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:43,830
He was ignoring him.
Um,

178
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,950
and uh,
she was lying there with her eyes

179
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:49,400
closed.
She was big fat lady and her kids go on.

180
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:49,490
Yeah,

181
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,600
Mama,
Mama,

182
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,370
Mama,
Mama,

183
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,420
Mama.

184
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,000
I mean yelling.
And I finally,

185
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,690
I sat up and I turned around and looked
at her and she looked at me like there

186
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:02,190
was something wrong with me.
I was like,

187
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:03,990
Bitch,
talk to your fucking kid.

188
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,570
He's screaming at you and you're
ignoring them.

189
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Some people just decide that because
they have to deal with the burden of

190
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,060
taking care of a kid and you know,
kids,

191
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,540
they have a short attention span.
They want your attention when they want

192
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,130
it.
They don't want to wait.

193
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,680
They don't have any patients.
They're fucking babies.

194
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:23,320
It's,
it's uh,

195
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,780
you know,
two to three year old baby and she just

196
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:30,900
wasn't having it.
She thought she thought she should be

197
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:33,450
able to just relax and that everybody
else,

198
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,000
she,
I guess she just didn't take any

199
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,640
consideration and all,
all the other people around her,

200
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:43,410
while her kid is fucking screaming,
she's just laying there with her hands

201
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:47,010
folded in her belly and she didn't like
this fat belly.

202
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,510
Her hands were laying on top of her fat
belly and it wasn't pregnant.

203
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,490
I don't think she had three kids there.
She might've been just really into deck.

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,760
She might had another baby on the way,
but I think she was just fat.

205
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,860
I'm just going to guess she was fat and
this fucking kid was screaming in her

206
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:09,090
face and she just kept her eyes closed.
God dammit.

207
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,120
Pay attention to your fucking kid.
Lady.

208
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,870
Um,
but it was pretty evident right away.

209
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,950
There was no way I was going to be able
to get a podcast going and just talk

210
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:23,460
into it without this kid screaming in
the background,

211
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,500
which I mean,
might've been funny.

212
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,650
I Dunno.
I'd be more likely it would have been.

213
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,261
So,
uh,

214
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:38,261
I didn't do it,
but I'm here in my hotel room right now

215
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,310
it's five 20 and I have a show tonight
at eight o'clock,

216
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,370
so I've got a couple hours here to kill.
Um,

217
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,630
so I figured I'll do it here and I was
going to have my friend Ian Mccall Lawn

218
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,560
if you've,
uh,

219
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,680
Ian been on the podcast before.
He's been on fight companions before and

220
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,410
he's one of the UFC is top flyway
contenders.

221
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,970
He was scheduled to fight tomorrow,
but his opponent,

222
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:07,610
Justin scoggins did not make weight.
It's very unfortunate because a,

223
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,990
justin is a very,
very talented guy and I was looking

224
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:13,300
forward to watching that fight.
It would have been a really interesting

225
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:14,740
fight.
Um,

226
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,620
one of the big fights on the card that I
was looking forward to,

227
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,730
but so ian,
um,

228
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,640
wound up training for six weeks and
weighing in all for nothing.

229
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,260
He decided to weigh in any way just to
prove a point.

230
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,450
Um,
he fights at fly weight,

231
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,350
which is 125 pounds.
It's a brutal cut.

232
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,430
I think he probably walks around
somewhere around 150.

233
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:43,360
If I had a guest and he's got a cut all
the way down to one 25 and he just

234
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:47,950
decided to do it anyway just to make a
point because he's a professional.

235
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,623
So,
um,

236
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,080
hopefully we'll do a podcast later with
Ian.

237
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,670
You know what,
while I'm doing this,

238
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:57,160
I'm doing this on my eyes.
Whoops.

239
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,810
Okay.
Doing this on my iphone and I realize

240
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:04,100
why I'm doing it.
That I do not have airplane mode on now

241
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:06,410
I do.
So people can't call me cause I think if

242
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,860
somebody calls you,
the recording just stops.

243
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,170
So it's ongoing now folks.
And it's sitting here.

244
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,320
My mic stand is a diet coke can and a,
so I'm going to read some of this shit

245
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,770
that uh,
people,

246
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:24,780
um,
the questions people asked on,

247
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,140
on the twitter.

248
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,830
So I'm here,
I'm doing the laughing skull and Atlanta

249
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:32,680
tonight for two shows.
It's a cool little room,

250
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,740
but when I say a little room,
I mean it's fucking tiny.

251
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,240
I think it's a,
I think it seats 80 people and I was

252
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:43,030
just here a couple months ago,
uh,

253
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,030
for the Tabernacle.
I was at the Tabernacle Theater,

254
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,440
which is a big ass place and I just
decided like I don't really have that

255
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:53,470
much new material because really I was
working on,

256
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:55,630
um,
it just tightening down all the material

257
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:59,050
that I had for my special.
And um,

258
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,130
once I recorded a special,
now I'm in sort of like a,

259
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,940
um,
I guess you would call it subject

260
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:10,780
acquisition mode where I sort of sit
around and try to figure out what I'm

261
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,090
gonna,
what I'm going to expand upon,

262
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:15,670
like what,
what ideas I'm going to start planting

263
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:17,410
and then try to make them grow on stage.

264
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,080
This is the,
this is a scary part of doing standup.

265
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,020
I wouldn't say like obviously it's not
scary,

266
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,550
but this is the,
the most uh,

267
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,650
troublesome or nerve wracking or,
or exciting.

268
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:33,640
It's the most exciting time of standup.
The most exciting is certainly like the

269
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:36,250
actual filming of a special that's very
exciting.

270
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,120
And the idea that it's done and okay,
I did that material,

271
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:44,200
the best justice I could do and now I'm
going to release it.

272
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,190
Um,
and then the most exciting part after

273
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:51,710
that is this,
this period that I'm at right now where

274
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:54,470
I don't have shit,
I don't have any new material.

275
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,400
I have a bunch of subjects.
I have a bunch of ideas that I wrote

276
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:02,150
down on my phone.
I have a bunch of subjects that I talked

277
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:06,230
about on stage a few times,
but they never really became bits.

278
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:11,231
And I will eventually piece those out
and I'll put those up on a corkboard

279
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,680
with index cards to take index cards and
a right the subjects down.

280
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,060
And I slapped him up on a cork board so
I can look at them in my office.

281
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,980
And A,
I've got a few of those,

282
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,720
but man,
this is about as fresh and embryotic a,

283
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,690
uh,
state as my standup is ever in.

284
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,770
It's,
um,

285
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,920
there's a period that I've been over the
last few years.

286
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:37,010
I've been doing it every two years.
Every two years seems to be like a good

287
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:39,770
number for me.
Like I guess I could probably do a new

288
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,530
hour every year,
but I don't think it would be,

289
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:47,360
it's at its best and some of those bits
they get better as time goes on.

290
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,000
And I would,
I would love to have what I think is as

291
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:53,720
close to the finished version as I can
before release it.

292
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,520
So,
um,

293
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,640
so two years seems to be the,
the time that,

294
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,670
and so there's this period where you
sorta slammed down the Samurai sword,

295
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:08,440
you hammer it down,
get it to the,

296
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:13,340
the best edge that you can get it to,
and then throw it all away and start

297
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:14,174
from scratch.

298
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,610
So that's where I'm at,
you know?

299
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,740
So,
uh,

300
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,410
these kinds of podcasts probably help
subject matter,

301
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,970
um,
is,

302
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:26,480
um,
it's just up in the air.

303
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:28,120
I mean,
I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna

304
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:28,850
talk about.
So let me get,

305
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,900
get,
get to some of these questions.

306
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:32,660
I'm kind of rambling here.
Uh,

307
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,300
let's see what we got here.
Uh,

308
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,260
how can we help governor Gary Johnson
grow on social media,

309
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:41,870
etc. That's a good question.
Governor Gary Johnson.

310
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:45,320
I should tell you guys this.
A former governor,

311
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,850
I can't,
are you always a God?

312
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:47,421
He's like,
you know,

313
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:50,420
they say President Carter,
like Jimmy Carter's obviously not the

314
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:52,220
president anymore,
but they still call him president

315
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:54,560
Carter.
Uh,

316
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:59,570
I don't know how that works,
but what I do know is that he will be on

317
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:03,740
the podcast next Thursday with Doug.
Stan hope.

318
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,950
So Gary Johnson and Doug Stam hope
together because Doug has an idea of a

319
00:17:10,431 --> 00:17:12,740
great idea that we're going to announce
on the podcast.

320
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,060
I guess I could kind of announce it now
or talk about it now with Doug's idea

321
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:21,890
is,
is to do a live podcast during election

322
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,690
night and election night coverage
podcast and do a series of podcasts

323
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:31,691
actually live from the comedy store.
So the idea is we get a bunch of

324
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:35,310
different guys who have podcasts and
gals and you know,

325
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,210
whoever signs up for whoever we decided
to have on it.

326
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:38,601
But,
uh,

327
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:42,590
I believe bill burrs in,
I believe Mark Marin's in Doug's in,

328
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:45,100
I'm in.
And what we're gonna do is we're going

329
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:50,101
to do these podcasts live and either
we'll all on stage at the comedy store

330
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:53,580
at the same time or we will,
uh,

331
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:55,440
we'll mix it up and,
you know,

332
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:59,100
we'll have like shifts or something like
that or I think it's probably going to

333
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:02,760
be as,
as informal as possible.

334
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,220
So that's the deal.

335
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,340
I'm uncomfortable here cause I'm sitting
down in this weird way where I'm trying

336
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:13,170
to lean into this microphone.
I think when you get too close to these

337
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:17,430
things and picks up a bunch of pops.
So let me see if there's a better way

338
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:20,070
to,
I don't want to change the volume of

339
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:22,340
this.
Oh,

340
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,670
here's another crew.
So that's the,

341
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,860
that's the answer to that.
How can you help Gary Johnson?

342
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,610
Um,
I think a lot of word of mouth,

343
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,230
you know,
just talking about tweeting,

344
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,660
tweeting about it,
uh,

345
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,100
people read your tweets,
even if it's only a couple of people,

346
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:38,160
they'll tweet it out and spreads,
um,

347
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,740
you know,
tweet anything that you find that's

348
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:42,750
interesting.
Interviews of his,

349
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,660
maybe my interview that a I did with him
on the podcast.

350
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,790
Um,
other stuff that you can find him on

351
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,790
Youtube.
He's the most reasonable guy,

352
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,070
in my opinion,
running for president.

353
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,330
And people don't take him seriously
because he's a libertarian and it's

354
00:18:57,331 --> 00:18:59,430
either Democrat or Republican or waste
your vote.

355
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,920
That's like the mindset that we have
here in this country.

356
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,870
I think that this election is probably
going to change a lot of that.

357
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,520
Um,
I think that what,

358
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,700
what we're looking at right now is
probably one of the worst cases of,

359
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,630
Oh,
I don't want to say the lesser of two

360
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:20,040
evil.
I just,

361
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,910
I don't like it.
I don't think you like,

362
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,580
I don't think anybody likes it.
I don't think that what we're,

363
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,080
uh,
what we're being offered right now is

364
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:31,050
the best,
the best options available.

365
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:33,750
I think it's the only options because I
think the job sucks.

366
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,200
I think nobody wants that job,
but Gary Johnson apparently wants it,

367
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,810
but it's just,
it's a fucked up job.

368
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:43,080
And I don't want to sit here and dwell
on politics and talk politics,

369
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,500
their buddy.

370
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,500
But it just to me is one of the most
depressing times ever for a picking a

371
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:51,540
president.
Um,

372
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,560
steven crowder from louder with crowder.
He's been on my podcast before.

373
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,920
He just put a video on youtube about all
the reasons why you shouldn't vote for

374
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:06,000
Hillary Clinton.
And he details all the different times

375
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:11,150
she's been caught lying and not just
lying about little shit lying about big

376
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:15,450
crazy shit.
Like the origin of her name.

377
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:19,470
She said that it was named,
she was named after someone who was like

378
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:22,110
the first guy to climb Mount Everest.
The,

379
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,160
but something like that.
Some someone to climb mount.

380
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:25,680
Not,
not,

381
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,150
not that.
I don't remember what it was.

382
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,260
Anyway,
uh,

383
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:33,261
it turns out the guy who she's claiming
she was named after did what she was

384
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:38,931
claiming he did when she was six.
So there's no fucking way that's true.

385
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,110
She lied about that.

386
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,560
She lied about a bunch of things.
She's,

387
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:48,610
she lied about Benghazi being by,
um,

388
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,320
a video.
I don't know if you guys remembered

389
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:54,160
that,
but there was a video that someone put

390
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:59,161
on youtube that it was some video about
Islam and it was really bad.

391
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,170
It was like a terrible,
terrible movie.

392
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:10,330
Some like ridiculously bad,
like amateur shitbag movie.

393
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,610
And the word was,
the word on the street for Awhile was at

394
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:20,611
that movie was the motivation behind the
attacks on Bengazi and it's total horse

395
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,760
shit.
And it was what the narrative was though

396
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,920
for a while.
And uh,

397
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:29,680
I mean Baby Hillary Clinton didn't know
any better,

398
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,260
but either way,
it's a,

399
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:34,820
it's an interesting video to watch if
she was,

400
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:40,110
you want to watch this video and decide
why you don't want to vote for Hillary.

401
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:44,050
But there's plenty of videos out there
that will let you know why you shouldn't

402
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:45,700
vote for Donald Trump either.
I mean,

403
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,870
fuck am I rambling about here?
Um,

404
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,490
I'm being political and we have a cup of
coffee here.

405
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,320
Uh,
so that's,

406
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,480
that's the answer.
Gary Johnson,

407
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,590
if you just,
you know,

408
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,430
tell people you enjoy is that he's a
fucking reasonable guy.

409
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,620
I got hung out with the guy.
I shot pool with him.

410
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,910
He's very reasonable.

411
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,750
Could he survive the barrage of the,
the trump,

412
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,090
the trump ads?
What do they call the trumpkins?

413
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,910
The guys who are really into trump?
I don't know those,

414
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:17,620
that's how that's a fucking weapon he's
got,

415
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,050
it's like back when opie and Anthony had
the pests,

416
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,280
they would turn the pests on them,
but then eventually the pest turned on

417
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:25,330
them.
It's interesting.

418
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,560
Um,
so that's the Gary Johnson answer.

419
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,930
Who's fatter Thompson or Bert Kreischer
that's a very good question to very good

420
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:36,520
question.
I don't know if you realize this,

421
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:40,120
but to my very good friends,
Tom Sigar and Bert Kreischer,

422
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,510
they're both hilarious guys and they
have decided to do this thing where

423
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,380
they're calling each other fad.
They're both,

424
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,010
I love them both to death,
but they both lose a couple of pounds.

425
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,570
They could both lose a little.
Um,

426
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,670
and they've just decided,
uh,

427
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,680
to,
uh,

428
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,550
have this public thing where it's like,
Hashtag bird is fat.

429
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,900
Hashtag Thomas Fat.
I'm going to move my phone to this new

430
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:08,860
thing.
Ooh,

431
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:10,570
that's better.
Um,

432
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,140
and so they sell t shirts like half
Hashtag Thomas fat and Hashtag birdies

433
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:20,740
fat tee shirts and all the proceeds for
the sales of those go directly to them.

434
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,690
So you're not helping any fucking
charities?

435
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,490
No starving.
Kids are getting fed.

436
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,920
They're just going to buy food and get
fatter.

437
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,770
And Burt's case,
he's probably going to buy boxes of

438
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:31,570
wine,
Burg drinks,

439
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,860
boxes of wine in an evening.
And someone's trying to explain to me

440
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:39,460
how many bottles of wine that is and we
don't really know.

441
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,680
I could google that.
I'm going to google that right now.

442
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,200
Let's find out.
If you had to guess,

443
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,400
how many boxes of wine would you say?
Let's take a quick,

444
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,820
let's see,
I guess how many or how many bottles

445
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:55,280
rather?
How many bottles of wine or in a box?

446
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,173
All right.
Haley.

447
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,180
Bottles
of wine in a box.

448
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,940
Here it goes.
Um,

449
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,670
I'm good.
Before I click on it,

450
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:05,780
I'm going to say,
I think,

451
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,730
I think it was nine.
I'm going to say nine.

452
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,540
That seems like a lot for bottles.
Okay.

453
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,080
Oh,
no,

454
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,913
no.
Okay.

455
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,860
Six,
six and two thirds bottles.

456
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,870
All right,
here it goes.

457
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,120
750 milliliter bottles.
How many?

458
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:25,121
750 milliliter bottles are there in a
five liter box of wine.

459
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,300
It's six and two thirds.
And if it's a three liter box of wine,

460
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:33,920
it's four bottles.
Hmm.

461
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,240
I bet he's drinking the six and two
thirds in a night.

462
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,130
I think he's done more than one.
I forget what he said,

463
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,400
but he's definitely drank at least one
box in a night on a regular basis.

464
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,970
So that's four bottles of wine.
I would be dead.

465
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,820
I don't know how he does it.
Well,

466
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:57,680
he's,
he's definitely fat.

467
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,140
I mean that helps it a,
and then it's also,

468
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:02,810
there's a,
there's a tolerance issue.

469
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,290
When you drink that much all the time
you bought,

470
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,010
your body just gets used to it.
There's um,

471
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,860
you know,
your body's like,

472
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:14,400
okay,
this asshole is going to be porn

473
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,350
poisoned down the hole every day,
uh,

474
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,870
time to get used to it.
So that's why

475
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,420
mythbusters mythbusters.
How many bottles of wine in a box?

476
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,080
I've been told a box of wine is
equivalent to five bottles.

477
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,600
Now I got to see if it's truth or a
myth.

478
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,690
We kind of,
that's not a myth.

479
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,990
It's a measurement is just somebody's
wacky website.

480
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,850
Um,
so that's what the Bert and Tom Acoust

481
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,910
fat thing is all about.
So if you,

482
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,210
if you see Hashtag Bert is fat,
that's what that's all about.

483
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,460
Uh,
or Hashtag Thomas Fat,

484
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,200
which is sort of a retaliation and they
would call him Bert Chrysler.

485
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,280
I don't know.
Um,

486
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,010
Tom's podcasts with his wife,
Christina Palicki.

487
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:05,840
They have this podcast called your mom's
house.

488
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,980
It's fucking hilarious.
It's really funny and it's really,

489
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,280
it's really unique.
It's really their own kind of thing.

490
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,470
I only did it once,
but it's really fun.

491
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,540
They have their own vibe.
They're the,

492
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,760
they're the pound for pound funniest
couple,

493
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,580
Tom and Christina.
It's close.

494
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,050
It's like bonding.
Mcfarland.

495
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,440
Rich Vos are right up there.
But um,

496
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,040
man,
Tom,

497
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:33,130
I think Tom and Christina might have
them buy a hair by hair.

498
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,970
All right,
next question.

499
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,380
Boy,
some of these questions are fucking

500
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:41,960
terrible.
We'll the doom podcast ever happened.

501
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:44,580
That's a good question.
Soprano pictures.

502
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,810
Yeah.
I probably will.

503
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,300
Um,
as just been crazy busy.

504
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,850
Um,
editing the comedy special right now and

505
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,890
when that's over I'll have some rest and
relaxation time and yeah,

506
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,750
we'll probably,
but we're going to do is it probably

507
00:26:57,751 --> 00:27:01,350
won't be like a regular podcast because
it probably won't be that interesting to

508
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:02,760
listen to or watch.

509
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,630
We'll have it just like as like a
supplemental thing or we'll do it on

510
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:09,360
twitch.
Twitch is this thing that uh,

511
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,630
these young kids are doing these days.
Twitches this.

512
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,940
Um,
and I'm sorry if this is popping,

513
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:19,941
I might be too close to this if I'm
popping my peas twitches.

514
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,250
His thing that um,
young kids are doing words.

515
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,410
You're watching video games being played
by other people and it's really popular.

516
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,060
Hugely popular.
In fact,

517
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:31,800
they make money from it.
They,

518
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,280
they play video games and they make
money playing video games.

519
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:38,520
Like who saw that coming?
Nobody.

520
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,110
Right.
Nobody ever thought that it would be

521
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:42,090
interesting to watch people play video
games,

522
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:45,810
but when I used to play quake,
people used to get into these things

523
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:48,440
called demos.
Like you would watch guys like there's

524
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,430
this,
this kid named thresh.

525
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,100
He was like the big game or back in the
day,

526
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,650
um,
the big quake players like one of the

527
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:57,240
best in the world if not the best.

528
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,510
And uh,
I would watch his demos just cause he

529
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:05,340
could fuck black guys up playing that
game in a way that I could never do.

530
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,790
And I think if you can watch someone do
something,

531
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,930
like what I was competing in taekwondo
tournament's one of the things that

532
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:16,380
really helped me a lot was I would go,
like when I was coming up,

533
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,710
I would go and watch like big time
tournaments.

534
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:24,711
Like I went to Colorado Springs to watch
the World Cup and this was in like,

535
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:31,260
I would say like 1986 I think it was.
And I went to Colorado Springs to wash

536
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:34,800
the World Cup because I knew that the
best fighters in the world,

537
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,660
we're going to be there.
The best taekwondo guys,

538
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,520
guys like herb Perez and um,
God,

539
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:43,230
I'm trying to remember some of these
names.

540
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,280
Um,
there was this guy,

541
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,790
not seem,
no,

542
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,780
I don't remember his last name,
but he was this bad motherfucker from

543
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:52,980
the Ivory Coast.

544
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,130
Boy,
I'll remember it as soon as this podcast

545
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:57,330
is over,
I'll remember his name.

546
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,030
It's driving me crazy.
Um,

547
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,780
Patrice,
patrice remark,

548
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,590
that's his name.
Patrice remark was his name,

549
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:05,430
was not,
not seeing,

550
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,790
not seen was another guy who is also a
bad motherfucker.

551
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,440
There was a bunch of them.
But anyway,

552
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,810
these guys were like at a very high
level,

553
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,830
um,
much,

554
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,470
much better than me.
And I remember going and watching them

555
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:20,880
compete made me better.
I remember seeing that level of

556
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:23,400
competition and then all of a sudden in
my mind,

557
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,600
uh,
I had higher expectations of myself and

558
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,540
a higher,
um,

559
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,900
higher,
higher ceiling I guess of potential.

560
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:38,580
Like I looked at all these guys and how
good they were and I realized what was

561
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:40,200
possible.
So it,

562
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:45,230
it sort of ramped up in my mind what I
needed to do to be at my best.

563
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,100
And immediately afterwards I went on to
win one of the biggest tournaments over

564
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:52,510
one,
which was um,

565
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,090
well one of the biggest in
Massachusetts,

566
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:58,300
the bay state games,
which was right after I got back it just

567
00:29:58,301 --> 00:29:59,940
from watching,
I got better.

568
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,520
Guaranteed point is we would watch these
things,

569
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,590
um,
these uh,

570
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,600
demos in quake.
So what you could do is there was a,

571
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,560
you had hit the till Dickey until the
key is that key that's right below the

572
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:17,800
escape button on your laptop or your uh,
your keyboard rather.

573
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,390
And it would pull this dropdown menu
like a,

574
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,310
like a control panel,
not even a dropdown menu.

575
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:25,900
It was just like,
it was like code,

576
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:29,740
like dos and you'd have to type in
certain things.

577
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,590
I forget what the,
how you would do it,

578
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,030
but you had to learn like what little
symbols to use and stuff.

579
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,820
Like it was almost like kind of coding,
but you could,

580
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:45,040
you could type in demo and you could run
a demo and then later on,

581
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:49,030
I think they put it in the menu,
the actual menu of the game.

582
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,930
But in the old days,
like especially the quake one days used

583
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:56,580
to have to uh,
used to have to know what to write in

584
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,980
the code and then you can record demo
and he would record a demo.

585
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:04,960
And this way you'd be watching the game
play out from the person's eyes.

586
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:10,090
Like you would watch their screen,
like what they're seeing when they're

587
00:31:10,091 --> 00:31:13,390
playing the game and it made you better.
It definitely did.

588
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:17,890
And I think it's exciting to watch too.
It's exciting to see if someone could

589
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:21,730
pull something off.
Like I'd watch this a thresh guy or um,

590
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:26,350
there was another guy named a mortal,
he was a bad motherfucker and uh,

591
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,320
he was uh,
another guy who was like one of the best

592
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:29,660
in the world.

593
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,830
You'd watch him play and you just go
cheese us.

594
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,890
Cause he would,
he would hit guys like there'd be an in

595
00:31:34,891 --> 00:31:36,880
mid air,
like jumping and he would shoot them in

596
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:39,850
the face of the rocket.
Just he was so good.

597
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,610
He would rail guys,
they had a rail gun.

598
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:47,611
Is this this a super high powered thing
that shoots this?

599
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,840
I guess like,
I don't know what a rail is,

600
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:54,930
a ball or something like that,
but it has this cool like tracer behind

601
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:58,210
it,
like this laser tracer like show and

602
00:31:58,211 --> 00:32:00,730
it's almost like instantaneous.
Um,

603
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,100
the,
the speed in it,

604
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:05,320
it's faster than a rocket and you'd be
able to,

605
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,200
you'd have to time it just absolutely
perfectly.

606
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,220
And these guys would be able to do
things with those rail guns that were

607
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,470
just so impressive to someone who's suck
like me.

608
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,610
You did watch it.

609
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,500
You watch it through their eyes and like
fuck.

610
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:21,940
And it just made you realize how bad you
socked and how good they are and how

611
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:25,150
much you had to,
how much more you had to work at it.

612
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,100
It was like,
one of the weird things about those

613
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:29,320
games is,
um,

614
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:33,820
how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Like the guys who are like really good,

615
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,300
they were so much better than,
than someone like me who was kind okay.

616
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,700
Like I was okay as long as I was playing
somebody who sucked or somebody who was

617
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:45,110
like,
at my level,

618
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,430
we just really didn't know what they're
doing.

619
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,750
And I was fucking playing a lot.
I was playing like eight hours a day at

620
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,840
one point in time,
sometimes even more completely obsessed.

621
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,130
I would,
it would,

622
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:57,530
it would fuck up all sorts of aspects of
my life.

623
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:02,531
I wouldn't get anything done that would
be constantly like just engrossed in

624
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,710
improving my performance in this fucking
crazy game.

625
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,970
And playing it online too was so
exciting because you'd be playing

626
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:13,820
against a bunch of people and these
people would be,

627
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,400
you know,
in real time essentially.

628
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:19,760
There was a little bit of lag in between
when you would shoot and when it would

629
00:33:19,761 --> 00:33:23,030
show up on the screen,
dependent upon how fast your connection

630
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:24,770
was.
But if you had a pretty decent

631
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,960
connection,
like cable modem or something like that

632
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,300
and you know,
the person was near you,

633
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,030
like fairly close in the same city or
something like that,

634
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,320
or at least in the same state,
you'd get like really commensurate pings

635
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,910
and you'd have these awesome matches
where you'd be basically playing in real

636
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:43,580
time against each other.
It's just so exciting.

637
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,610
And these levels that you would play on
if you've never played it.

638
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:52,540
3D shooter like unreal or quake or doom
or um,

639
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,121
there's,
there's,

640
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:54,230
you know,
there's a bunch of them now,

641
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,220
but these games that you would play,
the graphics would be so intense,

642
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,190
there'd be all these wild maps that you
would play on.

643
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:05,900
It was just really exciting and so much
more exciting than any other game or any

644
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:08,710
other thing that I've ever done before.
Um,

645
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,920
you know,
outside of fighting,

646
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,390
uh,
in a competitive way,

647
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:13,820
which just completely engrossing.
Uh,

648
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,490
so I,
I really had a problem with it for a

649
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:21,290
long time.
If you listen to this podcast for any

650
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,810
length of episodes,
I'm sure it's come up more than once.

651
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:28,160
I know I talk about the same things over
and over again sometimes.

652
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:31,470
And that's unfortunate,
but I always feel like somebody's,

653
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,630
somebody's listening doesn't know that
story.

654
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:37,700
And if I don't tell that story,
it's not going to make sense.

655
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,460
The people that are the hardcore people
that have heard this podcast,

656
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:42,500
you know,
listen to a hundred plus episodes.

657
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,040
You probably have heard that story,
but you know,

658
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,680
the,
the real issue is how many people that

659
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:51,050
are new that are tuning in for the first
time haven't,

660
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,310
I don't want to leave it out just
because I'm worried that someone's

661
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,144
already heard it.

662
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,250
So I always try to put that caveat in
it.

663
00:34:58,251 --> 00:35:00,170
For those of you who have heard this
before,

664
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,410
I'm sorry.
So my,

665
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:08,411
um,
my video game career as far as a,

666
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,000
I wouldn't call it a career obsession.
My,

667
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:16,270
my period of obsession lasted a few
years and I eventually had to quit cold

668
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:20,090
Turkey.
I had to walk away cause it was just

669
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:22,670
really interfering with my life.
And,

670
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:24,050
uh,
here's another story that I've told

671
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:26,360
before,
but I'll tell it again just because

672
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,150
people haven't heard it.
There was a guy who was a manager of the

673
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:30,680
comedy store.
It was a really nice guy.

674
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,230
His name was rob and rob was a in the
back of the comedy store once and he

675
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:38,520
said he was addicted to everquest

676
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,370
and everquest was,
uh,

677
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,480
like world of warcraft was one of the
first,

678
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,880
one of those,
um,

679
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,520
role playing games.
Those multiperson weird world games

680
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:51,511
where you,
you know,

681
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:56,511
I'm a sorcerer and you have either cloak
and go get a bag of gold and was wacky

682
00:35:56,851 --> 00:36:00,600
fucking games.
But he was super addicted to it.

683
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,420
And one of the things that he said was,
he said,

684
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:08,421
I'm so good at making money in the game
world,

685
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,760
but so bad at making money in the real
world.

686
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,970
And the way he said it was like this
revelation,

687
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:19,620
like what the fuck is wrong with me?
He was really devastated and he was

688
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:20,810
sitting there,
he's Pale,

689
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:25,420
looked like he hadn't seen his son and
weeks he looked like he hadn't sleeping

690
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,170
right.
His eyes were all fucked up from staring

691
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:33,171
at a computer screen every day.
And that was the moment I think where I

692
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:36,030
realize like,
oh yeah,

693
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:40,140
like these fucking things will sap you
have your life.

694
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,030
Like it might be fun while it's
happening,

695
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,100
but it's,
when it's over,

696
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:46,350
it's not fun.
Like the memories,

697
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,480
they're,
they're weird memories.

698
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,450
Like,
if you play a game,

699
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,840
like say if you,
uh,

700
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,920
play a baseball game and you knock a
home run out of the park and everybody

701
00:36:57,961 --> 00:37:00,930
cheers and he run the bases and you high
five your teammates,

702
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:04,410
you have a good time.
That's a real memory.

703
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,670
But if you play a guy in a video game
and you play for eight hours and you

704
00:37:08,671 --> 00:37:12,750
beat him in some,
some crazy match when it's over,

705
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:14,970
he don't feel like anything really
happened.

706
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,160
I wonder if that's the case.
If someone's playing in a major

707
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:23,490
tournament,
maybe it was just me because I have the,

708
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,450
uh,
I had the,

709
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,780
the thought in my head that I was
wasting my time like that,

710
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,090
um,
I should be doing other things.

711
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:33,900
I have things that I need to be doing
and I'm fucking off and playing this

712
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:36,690
video game.
And so I had like a negative attachment

713
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,260
to the idea of playing a game.
And maybe if I was like one of those

714
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,450
dudes are like one of those starcraft
games.

715
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,720
I don't know if you're familiar at all
with video games,

716
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,620
but if you,
uh,

717
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:49,920
if you are familiar,
you know that they have these crazy star

718
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:54,921
craft tournament's in Korea and um,
I guess they have been America too and

719
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:57,090
that they,
maybe Europe as well.

720
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,110
Maybe I'm just talking out of my ass,
but in Korea I know they're huge and

721
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:04,390
they fill up arenas.
I'm talking like,

722
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:08,580
like a fucking Coliseum,
like 25,000 people and they have these

723
00:38:08,581 --> 00:38:13,581
giant screens and people watch these
guys play video games in real time and

724
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:20,130
they cheer and they know like the moves.
So when someone's doing something good,

725
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,990
they get crazy.
And when someone's making a mistake

726
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,450
they're like,
oh no,

727
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,150
it's weird.
It's weird to watch.

728
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:30,570
And I believe there's real money in it.
Like I know there's,

729
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:34,380
um,
guys that do play in video games and

730
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:36,010
tournaments and then professional

731
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,530
video game leagues that can actually
make real money.

732
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:40,900
And then they make that money on that
twitch thing as well.

733
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,310
Twitch,
uh,

734
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:44,920
I don't know.
It's twitch.com I guess they somehow or

735
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:45,910
another,
I don't,

736
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,830
it's been explained to me,
but I forgot.

737
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,150
There's,
um,

738
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,810
I guess people,
I don't know if you get paid per how

739
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:55,960
many people are watching you or people
donate or,

740
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,080
I dunno,
they make money.

741
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,450
They make money off of twitch.
So there's that.

742
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:03,280
So maybe those people that are playing
these,

743
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,460
these big time,
starcraft tournament's maybe to them it

744
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:11,461
feels the same way as it would feel if
you were a major league chess player and

745
00:39:11,951 --> 00:39:14,210
you won a tournament.
I swear.

746
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:19,230
Because some games are highly respected
and some games nobody gives a fuck about

747
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:22,810
like games.
They carry their own sort of,

748
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,650
I dunno,
not really prejudice,

749
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:29,110
but games have their own little thing
that they're attached to them,

750
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,490
right?
Like chess.

751
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:34,200
Chess is a thinking person's game.
And if you tell someone you played

752
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:34,840
chess,
they're like,

753
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,520
Ooh,
you must be smart.

754
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,410
Right?
It tells me to play poker.

755
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:38,951
They go,
oh,

756
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:40,690
you degenerate gambler.
Fuck.

757
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,210
Like there's,
there's games that people don't

758
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:45,040
appreciate.
Like you tell someone,

759
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:46,130
yeah,
I'm uh,

760
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,270
I played for professional pool.
They go,

761
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:50,500
oh,
that's a thing.

762
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,390
You know,
it's not like something like someone

763
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:54,490
saying they're a professional chess
master.

764
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:56,860
I mean a grandmaster of chess.

765
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,190
It becomes,
um,

766
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,050
that,
that's like very respectable.

767
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,660
Grand Masters.
Very close to grand wizard though.

768
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,600
That's one of the hilarious things about
the KKK.

769
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:12,910
They've wizards,
the grand wizard.

770
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,420
Like what?
He's a grand wizard of the KKK.

771
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,310
He's a,
he's a wizard.

772
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,700
You fucking child.
You're a wizard.

773
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,790
Uh,
have a fuck that I get.

774
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:27,850
Their point is there's no point.
I have no point.

775
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,110
Point is,
um,

776
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,300
video games.
Uh,

777
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,510
they scared the shit out of me because
they'd cost me a few years of my life.

778
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,830
Not really.
I mean,

779
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:37,870
I had a good time.
I had fun,

780
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,720
learned,
learned that I have a problem with games

781
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,670
along the way,
but I already knew that because of pool.

782
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,950
And a,
I knew that because of martial arts too,

783
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:48,580
because martial arts,
it's very similar in a lot of ways to

784
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,010
games.
Most recent podcast,

785
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,390
Brian Callan,
we,

786
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:54,280
uh,
we talked about that with,

787
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:57,640
um,
we're talking about Josh Waitzkin who is

788
00:40:57,641 --> 00:41:01,120
a famous chess prodigy who,
uh,

789
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:06,390
I feel like he was the inspiration
behind the movie,

790
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:10,390
searching for Bobby Fischer,
looking for Bobby Fischer or searching

791
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:13,810
for Bobby Fischer,
the movie with the Little Kid who was a

792
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:14,540
chess master.

793
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,980
I'm pretty sure Josh waitzkin was a,
um,

794
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,190
a big part of the motivation or the
inspiration for that movie.

795
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,800
And he went on to become a really
fascinated by Jujitsu,

796
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:29,740
was a student of Marcello Garcia.
I'm pretty sure he's a black belt now.

797
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:33,440
He's a brown belt back when I was
communicating with them on online,

798
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:37,550
were sending emails back and forth
because my friend Nathan was training

799
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:38,780
with him and,
uh,

800
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,030
he connected the two of us together.
And you know,

801
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:46,031
Josh is a fascinating guy and he was
also responsible for Marcello Garcia

802
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,600
putting a lot of content online,
I believe,

803
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,990
I hope I'm not wrong about this,
but Marcello Mig and action was a really

804
00:41:56,271 --> 00:42:01,271
interesting website where Marcello was
constantly rolling with people rolling

805
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:04,370
with new people in a school.
And he was,

806
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:05,131
uh,
you know,

807
00:42:05,131 --> 00:42:06,650
like people would come in and train with
them.

808
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:09,080
Like Eddie went down,
Eddie Bravo went down there and he

809
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:10,870
trained with them and they film it.

810
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,270
They put the role,
the sparring session online.

811
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,130
But they're all very friendly sparring
sessions,

812
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:16,791
but,
you know,

813
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,650
competitive.
And if you don't know,

814
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:22,370
Marcello Garcia,
he is a fascinating character himself.

815
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:26,090
He's a brilliant,
brilliant Jujitsu player who's a really

816
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:28,310
nice guy.
And you look at him and he's like kind

817
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:31,520
of baby faced and smiley,
but he's just one of the best in the

818
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:32,430
world.
And,

819
00:42:32,431 --> 00:42:33,740
um,
he doesn't compete anymore.

820
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,590
He's getting older and you know,
he stepped down.

821
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:37,181
But I,
I had,

822
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:39,260
uh,
the opportunity to watch him compete in

823
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,680
2003 and Brazil in Sao Paulo,
Brazil.

824
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,430
Um,
that was back when,

825
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:47,630
uh,
Eddie Bravo,

826
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,830
uh,
choked out.

827
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:52,250
Hoya gracie are tapped out horribly.
Gracie with a triangle choke.

828
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,920
He was the first American never top of
Gracie.

829
00:42:54,921 --> 00:42:58,460
And in that main,
uh,

830
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,460
tournament,
that's this huge Abu Dhabi submission

831
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:05,150
tournament.
The star of the show was Marcella

832
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,860
Garcia.
He was without a doubt the star of the

833
00:43:06,861 --> 00:43:07,430
show.

834
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,263
He,
uh,

835
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,360
fought this guy,
he had a match with the Sky Victor

836
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,380
Shaolin who barrow,
who was a very respected Jujitsu guy and

837
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:20,350
he choked him unconscious and it was
just a wild scramble.

838
00:43:20,351 --> 00:43:24,620
He caught his back and Shaolin tried to
roll out of it and marcel just sunk it

839
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:27,560
in deeper and deeper.
And before Shalon could even tap,

840
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:29,540
he was out cold and,
uh,

841
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,880
Marcella was just running through the
competition.

842
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,260
I remember we were all watching him
going,

843
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:38,150
Holy Shit.
Who is this guy just came out of nowhere

844
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:43,780
and was just so dominant and so dynamic.
And he had some really specific moves

845
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:47,810
that he liked to hit.
Um,

846
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,840
and particularly the way he would take
people's backs.

847
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,730
He was so good at chokes and he also had
a really scientific approach,

848
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,520
um,
where he wouldn't want,

849
00:43:58,521 --> 00:44:00,430
if you guys can hear that the fan just
kicked off,

850
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:01,903
do you care?

851
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,133
No one cares,
right?

852
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,720
Bitch off.
Off.

853
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,183
Yeah.
It goes.

854
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,640
Um,
but he,

855
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,900
he had,
uh,

856
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,740
an interesting approach where he had a
few techniques that he would do,

857
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:20,950
but he would do them extremely well.
Like he didn't have this gigantic

858
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:25,790
arsenal that he would attack with.
He would attack with gay teens and you

859
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,850
attack with rear naked chokes.
And there was a lot of things that he

860
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:30,680
wouldn't do.
He wasn't a big guy.

861
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,390
It wasn't like a big muscular guy,
which is one of the more interesting

862
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:36,450
things about him when you look at him.
It wasn't a scary guy.

863
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,490
He wasn't like,
there's certain Jujitsu guys,

864
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:42,840
you look at them and you go Jesus,
like who some are Pahar s is one of the

865
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:46,090
best examples of that cause he's just
built like a freak.

866
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:49,050
Like he's built like the comic book
version of Wolverine.

867
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,980
He's a short guy with giant muscles,
just thick fucking neck,

868
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:57,780
just terrifying guy rips people's legs
apart too and doesn't necessarily let go

869
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:59,400
when they tap.
He's kind of known for that,

870
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:02,040
which makes them even scarier.
He's injured a lot of guys,

871
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,510
but he looks like a scary guy.
When you look at Marcello Garcia,

872
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:09,240
he's like a really smiley guy.
And,

873
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,340
um,
because of the fact that it wasn't a

874
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:14,190
very physically nothing,
he wasn't physically strong,

875
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,640
but it wasn't a freak athlete.
It wasn't just explosive,

876
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:19,860
dominant,
just really muscular guy.

877
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:25,250
He developed just razor sharp technique
and leverage and that's how he won his

878
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:28,350
matches with,
that's how I ones matches,

879
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:30,600
which made it even more impressive
really.

880
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:36,020
And his,
his main techniques were chokes.

881
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,760
So most of the time it's putting guys to
sleep or,

882
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,610
or forcing them to tap.
But there was a lot of techniques that

883
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:45,990
were really common well-respected
techniques that he just never used.

884
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,510
And he would openly talk about them.
Like the Camorra,

885
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,480
uh,
which is a famous technique is actually

886
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:55,200
called the double wrist lock in catch
wrestling,

887
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,040
catch wrestling.
When people think about pro wrestling,

888
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,610
we think about pro wrestling.
You think about like Hulk Hogan and the

889
00:46:02,611 --> 00:46:07,530
Rock and the Seattle tricks and these
pre scripted events.

890
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,980
But wrestling used to be at one point in
time,

891
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:16,250
it used to be an actual match.
Like there was actual professional

892
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:19,110
wrestling and there was a,
uh,

893
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,320
a style of wrestling called catch or
catch as catch can think.

894
00:46:25,351 --> 00:46:27,660
That's how they would say and catch
wrestling.

895
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:32,661
There's like these guys like Karl gotch
and farmer Burns and a lot of guys who

896
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:35,470
wound up teaching,
uh,

897
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:40,550
some modern day MMA fighters and
grappling competitors like Josh Barnett.

898
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:46,730
Josh Barnett is probably the most famous
and the most successful catch wrestling

899
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:53,030
enthusiast and practitioner like Josh
Barnett is tapped out some really famous

900
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,650
Brazilian Jujitsu competitors like,
uh,

901
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:02,790
here on Gracie or a dean lister.
Dean lister being an incredibly

902
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,990
impressive,
because Dean hadn't tapped to anybody

903
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:10,020
and I've got,
I want to say at least 10 years when

904
00:47:10,021 --> 00:47:11,960
Josh finished him in,
uh,

905
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,660
this competition called metamorris.
But,

906
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,570
um,
that's what wrestling used to be.

907
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,650
And they had a bunch of submissions.
Like a lot of the submissions that we

908
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:27,630
think of as Jujitsu submissions also
existed in catch wrestling.

909
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,650
And I guess when people are,
you know,

910
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:30,370
grappling,

911
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,590
I mean,
the people been grappling through at the

912
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:34,300
beginning of time.
I mean,

913
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:37,330
when people first started fighting,
that's probably how they fought each

914
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:39,460
other.
They probably grabbed each other and got

915
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:42,130
close enough to bite or hang onto each
other.

916
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,470
And then slowly people started
realizing,

917
00:47:44,471 --> 00:47:44,981
hey,
you know,

918
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:48,220
when I do this,
it seems to keep the guy away from me.

919
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:52,270
Or when I do this I can hold onto them.
Or I used to hold them like this,

920
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:53,890
but now I realize when I hold him like
this,

921
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:55,540
it works even better.
And,

922
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,351
uh,
when I do this,

923
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:57,730
it really hurts.
And when I do this,

924
00:47:57,731 --> 00:47:58,570
it doesn't hurt.
And so they,

925
00:47:58,930 --> 00:47:59,830
you know,
I mean,

926
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:03,340
back in the days of the spartans and the
Romans,

927
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,540
if you look at some of the statues,
like I was in Italy recently and we

928
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:09,370
were,
we went to Rome and we,

929
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:10,380
uh,
looked at some of the,

930
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,520
the artwork of the Vatican in
particular.

931
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,160
There's just a lot of statues of guys
wrestling,

932
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,110
a lot of,
lot of looks like,

933
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:19,480
like grappling holds and grappling
position.

934
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:24,481
So it's been around forever.
But what Brazilian Jujitsu really was,

935
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:30,420
is these guys who are not very big,
Elio and Carlos Gracie of there,

936
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,040
they weren't the biggest guys in the
world.

937
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,310
There were small and they weren't
physically strong and they figured out

938
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:40,930
how to use technique and leverage to
overcome physical strength.

939
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:45,730
And one of the matches that Eylea got in
early in his career,

940
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:48,520
he would have these crazy matches with
people.

941
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:53,700
He had a match with this guy named
Kimora and Kamora caught him in,

942
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,690
um,
what catch wrestling would call a double

943
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:03,691
wrist lock where you clamp down one hand
on the wrist and then you throw an over

944
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:10,441
hook around the arm and clamp your other
hand down on your wrist.

945
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,950
So you have one hand on his wrist,
one hand on your wrist and it creates

946
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:19,300
this awesome fulcrum point and you can
manipulate someone's arm.

947
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:24,300
But Marcello Garcia always felt like
that position required a lot of physical

948
00:49:24,371 --> 00:49:27,130
strength and he wasn't a very strong
guy,

949
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:30,490
so he just abandoned that.
He just decided it wasn't an option and

950
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:35,260
it was just going to concentrate
primarily on things that were sort of

951
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,110
just had ultimate technique to them.
And chokes pretty much have ultimate

952
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,420
technique.
And one of the reasons why I chose an

953
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:46,960
ultimate technique is if someone lands
it perfectly,

954
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:51,220
they you go unconscious.
Whereas an Armbar like guys have gotten

955
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:56,221
their arm broken before and come back
and fought and won and had their heart

956
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:01,270
are awfully hyperextended and come back
and won.

957
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:06,840
Like a perfect example in Jujitsu is
Hodrick gracie versus joc arrays is a

958
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:11,590
very famous match between two guys that
are competing in mma now.

959
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,620
But back when they were fighting and
Jujitsu,

960
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:18,630
they were amongst the best in the world.
And Hydro Gracie caught jock Ra in an

961
00:50:20,921 --> 00:50:25,210
arm bar and snapped his arm and jockey
would not tap,

962
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,650
he would not tap.
And he fought out of it.

963
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,650
And eventually,
um,

964
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,820
he was ahead on points when he got up,
uh,

965
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,800
when he got out of the arm bar,
but his arm was just destroyed.

966
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:40,610
So if I remember correctly,
I think he might've even tucked his arm

967
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:45,850
inside his belt and just kept going
until the time limit ran out.

968
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:51,680
And then a raised his one good arm and
got all excited and you know,

969
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:56,150
had one because he gutted it out and
would not tap when this guy snapped his

970
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:59,090
fucking arm.
And this is by the way,

971
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,240
professional Jujitsu.
This isn't even mma.

972
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,830
This is not like a,
you know,

973
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:07,160
a Rhonda Rousey match or a conor
mcgregor fight where they're making

974
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:10,490
millions and millions of dollars.
I don't know how much money this guy was

975
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:14,810
getting paid for for this Jujitsu match
in his sponsors and how much it was

976
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:17,780
actually worth to him.
But as far as his pride,

977
00:51:17,781 --> 00:51:21,740
it was worth it to him to actually get
his arm broken instead of tapping,

978
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:23,840
which is fucking crazy.

979
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,770
Uh,
so boy,

980
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:31,340
that's a long and circuitous.
I've lost my own train of thought.

981
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:36,550
My train of thought was that there's
certain techniques that you could really

982
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:39,110
hurt a guy,
but they don't have to quit.

983
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,640
And Hydro Gracie landed the perfect arm
bar on Joc array,

984
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,510
broke his arm and jock rates still won
the fight on points at least.

985
00:51:47,511 --> 00:51:49,220
I mean,
if they had been fighting old school

986
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:52,790
gracie way,
your probably would have eventually got

987
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:55,910
him because Jacari really couldn't
defend himself correctly anymore.

988
00:51:55,911 --> 00:51:57,380
And he would,
he would eventually,

989
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:00,050
since he's only got one arm to defend
himself,

990
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,810
heidrick probably would have wound up
choking them or catching him in

991
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:04,340
something else.
Uh,

992
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,350
but you know,
it's entirely possible he wouldn't,

993
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:09,500
and it's totally possible that Shakuri
even with a broken arm could have gotten

994
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,530
him.
But the point being when you choke

995
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:15,050
someone to sleep instead of break their
arm,

996
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,550
they can't do anything.

997
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,740
They're done.
You,

998
00:52:17,741 --> 00:52:21,350
you put them to sleep.
And that was Marcello Garcia,

999
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:24,230
his philosophy.
He realized that he could just put

1000
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:28,550
someone to sleep and then they could be
no debate as to whether or not he was

1001
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:31,830
going to win and no debate as to whether
or not the,

1002
00:52:31,831 --> 00:52:34,730
the move was actually efficient or
effective.

1003
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,040
It was obviously affected.
The guy was asleep.

1004
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:37,941
And,
uh,

1005
00:52:37,941 --> 00:52:41,750
that's what we saw in Brazil when he
fought a Shaolin and just put him to

1006
00:52:41,751 --> 00:52:42,620
sleep.
I mean,

1007
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:44,510
seconds too.
It's a crazy,

1008
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,700
crazy video that you could watch on
youtube.

1009
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:49,820
Um,
so Josh Waitzkin,

1010
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,980
who was a,
um,

1011
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:57,100
a student of Marcello's put all of 'em
Marcello's moves and sort of just sort

1012
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:00,830
of like a,
as something that people can learn from

1013
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:05,831
and grow from and put it all online.
So Games doing podcast.

1014
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,500
So Josh who is a,
obviously because of he's a chess

1015
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:16,790
prodigy,
is fascinated by games and chess being

1016
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:21,710
one of the most intellectually inspiring
games got really into Jujitsu as well.

1017
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:26,100
So I just know because of the way I got
into martial arts and the way I got into

1018
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:27,750
video games and pool,
it's just,

1019
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,640
there's something about those weird
challenges that can really,

1020
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,900
they can,
uh,

1021
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,220
really excite the mind.
The only problem is I don't necessarily

1022
00:53:38,221 --> 00:53:43,050
know if they have the same kind of real
world benefits as getting really good at

1023
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:47,070
a sport or getting really good at an
actual physical activity where you move

1024
00:53:47,071 --> 00:53:49,980
around and do things.
So

1025
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:52,700
I dunno.
Uh,

1026
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:55,740
but we will eventually do a doom podcast
and I will,

1027
00:53:55,741 --> 00:53:59,730
uh,
I will prepare myself where I make sure

1028
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,590
that there's no fucking way I get
completely and totally addicted anymore.

1029
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,200
Cause I've been there,
I've been there.

1030
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:09,720
It's not the move.
I can't,

1031
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:13,110
I don't have time for that anymore.
Uh,

1032
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:17,820
other questions here who will do
international paper view instead of you?

1033
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,310
Uh,
if you don't know what that question is

1034
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:21,960
about.
I uh,

1035
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,680
decided recently I was getting,
at one point in time it was going to not

1036
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:29,220
work for the UFC anymore.
I was going to just do these fight

1037
00:54:29,221 --> 00:54:34,050
companion podcasts that I do with Eddie
Bravo and Brendan Schaub and Brian

1038
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:36,510
counts sometimes and,
and other people sometimes too,

1039
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:40,050
when those guys were out of town.
I did one recently with Joey Diaz was

1040
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:42,210
one of the best ones ever.
But what did it,

1041
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,270
what the fight companions are as we just
sit around and we'd watch the fights and

1042
00:54:45,271 --> 00:54:48,480
we talk some shit and I don't,
I'm not working that way.

1043
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:52,290
Um,
I just work a little bit too much,

1044
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,350
um,
between standup comedy,

1045
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,510
writing,
standup comedy,

1046
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,720
doing podcasts,
researching the guests,

1047
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:05,430
researching subjects.
I'm researching potential guests.

1048
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,670
Uh,
and then life,

1049
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,110
you know,
all the other things that I have to do

1050
00:55:11,111 --> 00:55:13,380
was exercise,
Yoga,

1051
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:15,840
forget about family time,
all that other stuff is,

1052
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,050
you know,
that also there's a lot of time that is

1053
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:20,220
already accounted for.

1054
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:25,440
And then there was a ufc and I had to
figure out what things I wasn't,

1055
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,140
what,
what things I could cut back on.

1056
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:29,850
I wasn't going to cut back on family
life.

1057
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,320
Um,
I wasn't going to,

1058
00:55:31,321 --> 00:55:33,270
I don't,
I don't want to cut back on my

1059
00:55:33,271 --> 00:55:36,780
recreational activities because they
keep me sane for,

1060
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,950
for,
for me.

1061
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,710
I need a bunch of stuff that I'm
interested in.

1062
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,480
I can't just work.
Uh,

1063
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,620
even though work is awesome,
I love doing stand up,

1064
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:46,950
uh,
love.

1065
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:49,080
I even love doing the UFC.
I love it.

1066
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,120
I love it.
I mean it's,

1067
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,570
it's a very exciting job and it's an
honor to be able to do,

1068
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,040
but,
but it's,

1069
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,660
it's work and it requires energy and it
requires focus.

1070
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:09,140
And I feel like at the end of the day,
you only have so much energy and so much

1071
00:56:10,111 --> 00:56:15,111
focus and you could be in a situation
where you almost are two fortunate and

1072
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:18,390
you have,
you have too many things that you enjoy.

1073
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,600
And that's where I kind of found myself.
So,

1074
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:24,160
um,
so that's

1075
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,830
what I decided.
I sided decided what I'm going to do is

1076
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,600
I am going to only do North American
paper view.

1077
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,120
That's it.
No more fox shows,

1078
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:38,800
no more long international flights
because first of all,

1079
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:41,860
those things fucking wreck your body.
They're wreck me.

1080
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,380
I would do them.
And then for days like I just got back

1081
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:47,050
from Italy.
It took me like a week,

1082
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:50,980
like at least four or five days before I
felt it felt normal again.

1083
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:53,170
It just,
your buys all fucked up,

1084
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:55,060
you're jet lagged,
you're confused,

1085
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:57,490
you're exhausted.
You just feel,

1086
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,580
you feel like you're at 60% all the
time.

1087
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:03,100
You're always trying to push through.
And uh,

1088
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:08,101
it's a drag enthusiasm and having a
vitality like physical vitality and

1089
00:57:08,471 --> 00:57:13,471
feeling good and feeling healthy is a
big factor in life for me.

1090
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:14,950
Um,
that's,

1091
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,710
that's a huge thing.
I like feeling good.

1092
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:21,790
I like being healthy when I know
something is going to make me feel

1093
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:25,390
physically bad and make me feel
unhealthy.

1094
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,170
I try to avoid as much as possible.
Uh,

1095
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,850
you know,
there's sometimes I give in like,

1096
00:57:30,851 --> 00:57:32,590
uh,
maybe I'll have a couple of drinks with

1097
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:36,190
some friends and we get a little crazy
and the next day I'm like,

1098
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,660
Oh,
you dummy.

1099
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,050
I've done that before obviously.
But even the,

1100
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:44,620
like a hangover,
I feel better in a day.

1101
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,300
Those fucking jet lags like,
uh,

1102
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,920
a flight from,
oops,

1103
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,850
a flight from Sydney just knocked over
the phone,

1104
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,710
a flight from Sydney,
Australia.

1105
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:58,570
That shit takes me a long time to get
better from a,

1106
00:57:58,571 --> 00:58:01,150
I don't want to become complaining here.
My point being,

1107
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:06,720
I try to avoid things that make me feel
shitty physically.

1108
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:12,930
And unfortunately a lot of flying makes
you feel shitty and especially flying

1109
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:16,030
along hours.
So who's going to do the international

1110
00:58:16,031 --> 00:58:18,100
paper views?
I think with the way they're doing it

1111
00:58:18,101 --> 00:58:21,940
now is Dan Hardee was a former fighter
and,

1112
00:58:21,941 --> 00:58:23,940
uh,
he's been a guest on his podcast.

1113
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,620
He's a fucking awesome guy.
Super Smart Dude.

1114
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:31,210
Super tuned in,
really interesting and intelligent guy.

1115
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:36,240
And um,
Dan actually trained with Dan for years.

1116
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:40,090
Back in the day when Dan used to train
at 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu,

1117
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:42,250
whenever he was in town,
he was getting ready for a fight.

1118
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,310
He would come to a Eddie bravos gym and
train.

1119
00:58:45,311 --> 00:58:47,950
I trained with them multiple times.
Super Nice Guy.

1120
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:51,820
So Dan Hardee,
we'll probably do a lot of them.

1121
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,900
And then of course,
Brian Stann who is fantastic,

1122
00:58:55,901 --> 00:58:59,290
who was also been on his podcast,
he'll do a lot of them.

1123
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,960
Um,
and then there's also,

1124
00:59:01,961 --> 00:59:04,420
Kenny Florian is also great.
He'll do,

1125
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,190
I don't,
I don't know how they worked that out.

1126
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:08,290
Like who does what,
but those are the ones that we're going

1127
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:09,580
to do it.
So,

1128
00:59:09,581 --> 00:59:11,950
uh,
that would be the answer to that.

1129
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:14,560
You fucks.
I don't know.

1130
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,360
I mean,
I really don't know.

1131
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:20,020
Um,
I dunno what's gonna happen with this

1132
00:59:20,021 --> 00:59:23,960
new ownership thing?
Either there's a bunch of new people

1133
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:27,500
that uh,
took over the UFC now that u of c is

1134
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:30,740
still going to be run by Dana White,
which is one of the reasons why I

1135
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:35,390
decided to stay
because a,

1136
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:37,160
you know,
Dana and I are or close,

1137
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:39,730
we've been good friends for a long time
and I,

1138
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:44,180
one of the things that I was really
nervous about was the idea that Dana was

1139
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:47,780
going to leave and some suits are going
to take over and then I was going to

1140
00:59:47,781 --> 00:59:50,780
have to have meetings with people.
They're going to tell me what I could or

1141
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:54,980
couldn't say or give me advice on how to
do it or any of that stupid shit.

1142
00:59:54,981 --> 00:59:56,330
I was like,
fuck this.

1143
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,360
That was like,
it was answering the question for me,

1144
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:01,760
like what am I going to cut back in my
life?

1145
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,380
As soon as I heard that they were
thinking about selling,

1146
01:00:03,381 --> 01:00:04,214
I was like,
well they're,

1147
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:08,030
that answered it for me.
But as time went on and I really thought

1148
01:00:08,031 --> 01:00:09,470
more and more about it,
I,

1149
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:12,290
I really thought that I would miss it
and I don't want to.

1150
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,390
And also,
um,

1151
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,830
I mean,
I don't mean to sound Corny,

1152
01:00:15,831 --> 01:00:18,110
but all the love that I got from people
online,

1153
01:00:18,111 --> 01:00:22,040
it influenced my be my,
my thinking too made me think that I

1154
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:24,680
probably should think about sticking it
out.

1155
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:26,510
So,
uh,

1156
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,130
that's the answer to that.
What do I think about the Fermi paradox?

1157
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:35,030
That's an interesting question.
If you don't know what the Fermi paradox

1158
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:38,720
is,
the actual definition is you to here,

1159
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,390
the actual definition is a,
it's about aliens.

1160
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:45,050
The question is where are okay,
here it is.

1161
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:49,430
Where is everybody?
The idea is if there is an is named

1162
01:00:49,431 --> 01:00:50,690
after,
I'll go to the wikipedia.

1163
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,620
The fermi paradox is named after Enrico
Fermi,

1164
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,350
uh,
as the apparent contradiction between

1165
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:01,160
the lack of evidence and the high
probability estimates,

1166
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:06,340
those given by the drake equation for
the existence of extraterrestrial

1167
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:11,350
civilizations.
And the drake equation is it's,

1168
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:15,650
uh,
an equation that's here.

1169
01:01:15,651 --> 01:01:20,180
I'll go to the wikipedia that it,
it's used to arrive at an estimate of

1170
01:01:20,181 --> 01:01:25,181
the number of active communicative
extraterrestrial civilizations in the

1171
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,613
Milky Way Galaxy.

1172
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:33,790
And the Fermi paradox is if you look at
all of the stars in our galaxy alone,

1173
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:40,430
billions of stars and billions of
galaxies,

1174
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,000
hundreds of billions of stars,
hundreds of billions of galaxies,

1175
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,370
many of them which are many,
many,

1176
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:50,450
many years older than our galaxy,
many years older than our planet.

1177
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:56,590
The question is why haven't these aliens
contacted us?

1178
01:01:57,970 --> 01:01:59,780
Where is everybody?
So that's the question.

1179
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:03,650
The fermi paradox.
I've thought about this a lot,

1180
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,660
so I'm actually happy about this
question.

1181
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:11,170
I have a feeling that our ideas about
what a society or what civilization does

1182
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:20,320
as it advances are based entirely on our
idea that we are dependent upon the

1183
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:27,531
monkey body that were dependent upon the
physical flesh and the idea of being

1184
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:34,611
somewhere in a measurable way that
that's the only way you can experience

1185
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:36,910
something.
Um,

1186
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,050
I think that that,
I think that's,

1187
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:42,990
that's an error on our part.

1188
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:47,340
I don't think that we are going to be
attached to the physical body forever.

1189
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:52,800
Does it sounds like hippie nonsense,
silly woo bullshit.

1190
01:02:52,891 --> 01:02:57,891
But this is my thought behind it.
I think that first of all we are moving

1191
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:04,641
closer and closer every day to being
integrated with technology and by

1192
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:09,030
integrated with technology.
I think initially it's going to happen

1193
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:14,060
where there's going to be some sort of a
chip that we have in our body,

1194
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:18,300
whether it's uh,
something that we use that it helps us,

1195
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:23,680
enhances our vision or enhances our
mental function or our ability to

1196
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:27,690
communicate with each other or our
ability to access information.

1197
01:03:27,691 --> 01:03:31,830
It's entirely possible that it might
start out as some sort of a helmet that

1198
01:03:31,831 --> 01:03:33,870
we put on that lets us,
you know,

1199
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,670
like maybe like a ball cap with
electrodes on it and you put this thing

1200
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:43,671
on and it stimulates areas of your brain
that allow you to see these images.

1201
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:50,730
And maybe perhaps like some sort of a
screen like minority report,

1202
01:03:50,731 --> 01:03:52,500
like it'll be in front of you.
Will,

1203
01:03:52,501 --> 01:03:54,570
you'll be able to access data,
will,

1204
01:03:54,571 --> 01:03:59,220
you'll be able to ask it questions.
I mean I have is hey siri function.

1205
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:00,120
We have this,
Hey Siri,

1206
01:04:00,121 --> 01:04:01,350
function on our,
um,

1207
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:05,340
our phones that people get pissed off
when I say it.

1208
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,880
When I say those words on the podcast,
because if you have an android phone,

1209
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:10,680
you don't know this,
but if you have an iphone,

1210
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:12,840
you have that option on.
If someone says those words,

1211
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:14,890
Hey Siri,
your phone goes buddy.

1212
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,010
Like you're asking it a question.
So you say,

1213
01:04:17,011 --> 01:04:19,380
Hey Siri,
where's the fellow?

1214
01:04:19,381 --> 01:04:21,300
Get a blow job around here,
or whatever.

1215
01:04:21,301 --> 01:04:24,680
Ask it some questions and it'll actually
answer you.

1216
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:25,771
You,
you could say,

1217
01:04:25,771 --> 01:04:27,180
hey,
Siri called Dunkin.

1218
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:28,930
It'll call Dunkin.
Uh,

1219
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,530
Hey Siri,
navigate to the Hollywood bowl.

1220
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:34,800
It'll give you the directions to get to
the Hollywood bowl in real time.

1221
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:37,800
It's amazing.
And it's science fiction.

1222
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:41,460
It's something that just a few years ago
was completely outside of our

1223
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,560
imagination.
We really didn't think that they were

1224
01:04:43,561 --> 01:04:46,560
going to have something that sat on the
table next to you.

1225
01:04:46,561 --> 01:04:51,561
Some small little sliver of glass and
metal and whatever the fuck it's made of

1226
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:53,490
electrodes.
No,

1227
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:56,820
it's in their silicone.
That you could talk to that thing and

1228
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:57,750
say,
Hey Siri.

1229
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:58,763
And it would,
uh,

1230
01:04:58,770 --> 01:04:59,491
you,
you could say,

1231
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:02,340
Hey Siri,
what is the Fermi paradox?

1232
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:06,390
And it would google it for you.
This is all something that's going on

1233
01:05:06,391 --> 01:05:11,391
right now and this is just one step.
It's one step in what is really as long

1234
01:05:14,221 --> 01:05:19,221
as human being stay alive as long we
don't get nuked as long as we don't murk

1235
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:22,660
ourselves,
as long as we don't get fucked up by a

1236
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:27,661
super volcano or an asteroid or some
polar shift or some natural disaster.

1237
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:33,070
As long as that doesn't happen and we
just not,

1238
01:05:33,071 --> 01:05:37,030
we not obviously not me,
but people smarter than me who do this

1239
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:39,040
kind of shit,
they're going to continue to innovate

1240
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,810
and as they continue to innovate,
we're going to get technology that is

1241
01:05:43,811 --> 01:05:48,811
more and more powerful and I think more
and more integrated in our,

1242
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:52,630
in our our lives and in our physical
bodies.

1243
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:56,350
I think it's going to reach,
there's going to be a bottleneck where

1244
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:01,270
holding a device in your hand,
it just doesn't have the same effect or

1245
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:06,271
do the same amount of things as they
could do if they actually put it in your

1246
01:06:07,241 --> 01:06:10,600
head and I think people are going to
fucking volunteer for it.

1247
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,280
I think they're going to volunteer for
it.

1248
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:16,030
Like they volunteer for braces,
like they get eyeglasses at the

1249
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:21,031
optometrist,
like they get fake tits people got,

1250
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,070
they're going to get these things put in
their bodies and it's going to be really

1251
01:06:24,071 --> 01:06:26,770
common and maybe won't even have to be
in your brain.

1252
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:29,950
Maybe that'll be the the hold back
people like I don't want to my brain,

1253
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:30,851
and they'll go,
well,

1254
01:06:30,851 --> 01:06:32,500
we don't have to do that.
We put on your wrist.

1255
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:36,310
It'll communicate with your brain
through the nervous system or through

1256
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:39,370
electrical impulses through your tissue
itself.

1257
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:45,090
And maybe that along with some sort of a
hat that you put on that allows you to

1258
01:06:45,191 --> 01:06:48,550
interface with the Internet.
That's going to be us step.

1259
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:52,630
But somewhere along the line,
if you listen to guys like Ray Kurzweil

1260
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:57,870
who believe ray believes that you're
going to eventually be able to download

1261
01:06:58,061 --> 01:07:03,061
your consciousness into a computer,
which of course gets really fucking

1262
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:08,800
weird because what are you then?
Are you still there?

1263
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,650
Here's the question.
If you download your consciousness into

1264
01:07:11,651 --> 01:07:13,480
a computer,
are you still existing in the physical

1265
01:07:13,481 --> 01:07:15,880
sense?
So if you exist in the physical sense

1266
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,230
and your consciousness is downloaded
into a computer to do the,

1267
01:07:20,231 --> 01:07:25,060
to get to talk to each other,
or are you like,

1268
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:31,590
do you end your life in the physical
sense and then begin one in a digital

1269
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:34,090
sense and as it even a life.

1270
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,320
But if it exists and some sort of a
matrix like state,

1271
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,600
if they could figure out a way,
you know,

1272
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:42,870
there's a lot of people today that just,
they just,

1273
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:47,440
they're not happy with the life that
they've been handed with the,

1274
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,510
the,
the roll of the dice.

1275
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:54,550
Maybe they have physical deformities,
maybe they have poor health.

1276
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,440
There's a lot of,
uh,

1277
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,430
people that just got a shitty hand when
it comes to life.

1278
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:04,390
Like a life is not even in the cards of
the deals.

1279
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,220
I don't have to tell you this,
you all know this,

1280
01:08:06,221 --> 01:08:10,710
right?
And if someone came along like a,

1281
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:14,800
what was that guy's name and the Matrix,
the guy who a wound up selling,

1282
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:18,500
everybody who just said he wanted it to
be famous or rich or something like

1283
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:20,540
that.
He's eating a steak in the Matrix and

1284
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:25,340
decides to give in that that kind of
existence.

1285
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:29,060
If someone comes along and says,
look,

1286
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:33,050
you don't have to live this life in the
physical sense anymore,

1287
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:38,740
instead of being dependent upon this
monkey body and the tooth Fang and claw

1288
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:45,790
of natural selection and evolution and
this just the struggle,

1289
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,340
the struggle of being a fucking human
being.

1290
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:54,520
Instead of that you can exist in this
perfect state where you are constantly

1291
01:08:56,511 --> 01:09:01,511
in love and just filled with joy and
having a wonderful life filled with only

1292
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:09,341
positive experiences.
And you can enjoy this with,

1293
01:09:10,461 --> 01:09:13,880
with no negative repercussions.
You could just,

1294
01:09:13,881 --> 01:09:17,030
you,
you can become a part of the matrix,

1295
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:19,460
a part of the thing,
whatever they're going to call it.

1296
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,760
And from there you will be the architect
of your existence.

1297
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,380
You will be able to decide this idea,
that law.

1298
01:09:25,381 --> 01:09:26,690
Well,
the bad days,

1299
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,490
they make you feel good about the good
days,

1300
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,160
you know,
there's no sunshine without rain.

1301
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,200
You know,
you got to have good and evil.

1302
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,970
Well that's,
that's here,

1303
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,490
that's in this state,
in this physical state.

1304
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,350
Yeah.
You have to have good and you have to

1305
01:09:39,351 --> 01:09:42,110
have eagle as we know it right now in
this life.

1306
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:46,460
We do appreciate our loved ones.
When something terrible happens,

1307
01:09:46,461 --> 01:09:48,680
when there's a tragedy happens.
Um,

1308
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:49,610
we,
we do,

1309
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,860
uh,
appreciate the people that are alive.

1310
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:54,140
When someone we care about dies.
Those are all,

1311
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,350
those are all true.
But is that the only way that we can

1312
01:09:57,351 --> 01:10:00,230
appreciate each other?
Is that the only way we can enjoy life?

1313
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:03,770
Some people would say yes,
but I don't think they'd really know.

1314
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:07,070
I think that's just,
we're basing that on what we have

1315
01:10:07,071 --> 01:10:10,610
experienced and what we would currently,
the data we're pulling from being a

1316
01:10:10,611 --> 01:10:12,080
human being,
living on earth.

1317
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:16,940
If someone can engineer,
and this is not something that might

1318
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,750
happen in a year or in a hundred years,
but we're,

1319
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:24,260
we might be talking about something that
happens at a thousand years or 2000

1320
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:25,640
years,
who knows?

1321
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:30,560
But around the same time where we think
that,

1322
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:33,860
uh,
technologically based civilization would

1323
01:10:33,861 --> 01:10:38,861
develop the capability of star travel,
of being able to travel not just into,

1324
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,600
uh,
another solar system,

1325
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:46,730
but perhaps he'd do another galaxy.
But maybe hundreds of galaxies away,

1326
01:10:46,731 --> 01:10:51,500
who knows?
But that kind of incredible ability to

1327
01:10:51,501 --> 01:10:55,820
control your environment.
We might not ever get there and we might

1328
01:10:55,821 --> 01:11:00,821
not ever get there because we realize
that being there physically is not

1329
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:05,810
nearly as important as the experience.
Like um,

1330
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:10,400
you know I've often said this about
psychedelics that people say,

1331
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:11,271
Oh,
you know,

1332
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:13,470
you have a psychedelic drug experience.
Yeah.

1333
01:11:13,471 --> 01:11:13,741
You,
Oh,

1334
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:16,410
you're imagining things are happening,
you're hallucinating.

1335
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,360
Well,
sort of,

1336
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:19,500
yes,
but no.

1337
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:24,650
Like it might not actually be happening.
Like if you have this experience,

1338
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:29,400
we take a psychedelic drug and you are
transported to the center of the

1339
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:32,700
universe and you are communicating with
love,

1340
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,880
with love in the form of beautifully lit
neon geometric patterns that are

1341
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:44,070
constantly changing and morphing and
they're filling you up with a wisdom

1342
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:48,060
and,
and joy and appreciation.

1343
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:49,921
When people say,
well,

1344
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:52,380
that's a hallucination.
You're taking a drug and you're having a

1345
01:11:52,381 --> 01:11:57,381
hallucination maybe.
But either way the experience is still

1346
01:11:58,891 --> 01:12:02,760
the same.
Like the experience of meeting God

1347
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:07,790
because you took mushrooms and and
having this incredible meeting with the,

1348
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,620
the divine force of the universe.
If,

1349
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:18,710
if that happens in real life or if that
happens in a psychedelic drug trip,

1350
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:22,620
the feeling and the experience are still
the same.

1351
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:27,750
It might not be a real physical thing
and the sense of you might not be able

1352
01:12:27,751 --> 01:12:31,950
to take it and put it in a pillowcase
and throw it on a scale and weigh it,

1353
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:36,480
but you can't.
Who's to say you could ever do that

1354
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:39,270
anyway,
like it's the exact same experience of

1355
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:44,100
meeting God.
It might be just as good as my point.

1356
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,570
So this idea that,
well I don't want to live in the matrix,

1357
01:12:48,571 --> 01:12:48,990
man.

1358
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:52,260
I want to live in the real world.
Are you sure?

1359
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:57,360
What's the benefit of the real world?
I mean it's the only reason why we think

1360
01:12:57,361 --> 01:13:02,220
that the real world contains some sort
of benefit for us is because that's the

1361
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:07,200
only model that we have to go on that
this is the pattern that we've been

1362
01:13:07,201 --> 01:13:10,830
following our whole lives.
That this idea that you know you live

1363
01:13:10,831 --> 01:13:13,640
and then you die and then you do your
best along the way.

1364
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:17,040
Sometimes you got to push through the
pain and sometimes you got to fucking

1365
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,420
get up in the morning where you don't
want to get up and you gotta.

1366
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:23,010
You gotta work hard and when you work
hard it pays off and you get a good life

1367
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:26,190
and you know your,
your discipline equals your freedom and

1368
01:13:26,191 --> 01:13:27,840
ugh.
There's a lot of thoughts that we have

1369
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:32,700
about living life that are applicable to
this physical knock on wood life.

1370
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:35,700
It's real life that you and I are
experiencing right now.

1371
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,880
Everybody listening to this podcast,
he had a pug your phone and you had to

1372
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,820
listen to it on a computer.
You got to touch some things and

1373
01:13:41,821 --> 01:13:45,970
something had to happen for you to free
to experience something in a,

1374
01:13:45,971 --> 01:13:47,460
in a,
in a real sense.

1375
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:51,300
But that's just because this is what
we're used to.

1376
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:52,621
We're,
we're,

1377
01:13:52,621 --> 01:13:56,400
we're definitely not used to.
And if she would talk about human

1378
01:13:56,401 --> 01:13:59,670
beings,
if you went back 200 years ago or

1379
01:13:59,671 --> 01:14:04,170
definitely not used to the Internet,
we're definitely not used to movies.

1380
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:07,470
200 years ago we didn't even have
fucking cars.

1381
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,770
If you wanted a picture of something,
you had to draw it.

1382
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:14,380
We're used to all these things now we're
used to photograph.

1383
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:18,130
The idea of not being able to take
photos on vacation is alien.

1384
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,900
The idea of having to get in a boat and
travel across the country.

1385
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,900
Like I was talking about how I just got
back from Italy,

1386
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:31,480
if I lived in the 18 hundreds I would
have had to been on a boat for months.

1387
01:14:31,481 --> 01:14:35,740
I would have had to made it from
California all the way to New York and

1388
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:38,230
then I had,
would have had to been in a fucking boat

1389
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:43,000
and gone across the ocean the same way
my grandparents did when they were

1390
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:46,510
little kids.
My grandparents came over here from

1391
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:48,450
Italy when they were like,
um,

1392
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:50,470
I think my grandfather was like seven
years old.

1393
01:14:50,471 --> 01:14:53,980
I think he said I would've had to have
done all that stuff.

1394
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,750
It's not going to happen.
Right.

1395
01:14:56,050 --> 01:15:01,050
So the idea of no photos is alien.
The idea of no movies,

1396
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:02,710
no,
no,

1397
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:04,600
no,
no cameras,

1398
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,660
no TV shows,
no radio.

1399
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:10,930
There's no radio back then.
What the fuck?

1400
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:16,000
You couldn't tune into a radio show in
1800 it didn't have them.

1401
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:21,090
They didn't exist.
All these things that are now a normal

1402
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:26,430
everyday part of our lives.
We're alien just a few hundred years

1403
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,880
ago,
which in terms of human civilization and

1404
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,070
certainly in terms of the life of human
beings,

1405
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:36,700
the existence of human beings,
it's not even a blink of an eye.

1406
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:40,450
This is all new and we couldn't imagine
life without it.

1407
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:46,140
I think if time keeps going or if rather
a civilization keeps going over time,

1408
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:50,560
if we don't do something incredibly
stupid or get fucked up in some sort of

1409
01:15:50,561 --> 01:15:54,550
a natural catastrophe,
we're going to come up with an ability

1410
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,490
to manipulate our environment,
our world,

1411
01:15:57,491 --> 01:16:02,020
our perceptions,
our mind to create an artificial world

1412
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:06,820
and artificial universe.
That's impossible for our little fucking

1413
01:16:06,821 --> 01:16:10,390
chimpanzee brains to,
to imagine.

1414
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:14,200
I don't think we have the capacity to
do,

1415
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:16,210
to,
to connect all the dots.

1416
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:21,780
I think with each new invention it opens
up a new complete realm of possibility.

1417
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:28,050
Like you couldn't say to someone in
1,801 day you're going to have google.

1418
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,580
Cause they'd be like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

1419
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,860
Well one day you're gonna be able to
talk to your phone.

1420
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:35,380
What the fuck is a phone?
But one day you're going to be able to

1421
01:16:35,381 --> 01:16:38,230
talk to your electronic device.
What's electronics?

1422
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,090
What do you,
what does the fuck are you saying?

1423
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:43,750
What are you a wizard that you would be
saying something to them that didn't

1424
01:16:43,751 --> 01:16:48,751
make any sense at all.
And that I think is how we have to look

1425
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:54,070
at the possibility for two or 300 years
from now.

1426
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:57,490
There's going to be new things that get
invented along the way.

1427
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,820
And you know,
in the old West who's electricity that

1428
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,360
metals,
new ways of connecting things and then

1429
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:09,600
teletype and Morse code and all these
different things got invented before

1430
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:11,780
they invented computers.

1431
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:14,510
The Internet,
the world where we're dealing with right

1432
01:17:14,511 --> 01:17:16,040
now,
when,

1433
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:19,100
when you look at two,
300 years from now,

1434
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:24,730
I think it's entirely possible that
these ideas that we have about what the

1435
01:17:25,131 --> 01:17:27,890
future is going to be like.
There was,

1436
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:32,900
there's big chunks missing.
There's chunks missing from a thought

1437
01:17:32,901 --> 01:17:37,901
process and it's because these paradigm
shifting revelations,

1438
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:43,970
inventions and innovations,
they haven't occurred yet.

1439
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:48,350
And when those things do occur,
I think it's going to forever change

1440
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:52,010
what the future will be.
And as these things occur,

1441
01:17:52,011 --> 01:17:56,150
whether it's the ability to download
consciousness or whether it's the

1442
01:17:56,151 --> 01:18:00,530
ability to record thoughts in,
in your own mind,

1443
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,360
record memories,
dreams,

1444
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:06,740
that's a real possibility.
What their thinking is.

1445
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:10,580
There's going to be a time where you
were going to have a hard drive,

1446
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:14,090
like a virtual hard drive or a physical
hard drive,

1447
01:18:14,091 --> 01:18:17,090
rather like someone's going to put an SD
card slot in your head,

1448
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:20,030
not an SD card slot,
something probably much smaller.

1449
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:25,180
It might even be as small as like Ray
Kurzweil has said as a cell,

1450
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:29,900
like a blood cell,
like one red blood cell in your body

1451
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:35,380
that's a machine or a computer or a
camera or some sort of recording device.

1452
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:41,060
This thing may be able to record your
thoughts,

1453
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:45,320
record how it feels to be you.
Like say if you,

1454
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:46,011
uh,
you know,

1455
01:18:46,011 --> 01:18:47,720
fill in the blank.
If you're A,

1456
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,620
I dunno who Ashton Kutcher,
let's pretend you're asked in coacher.

1457
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:56,800
If Ashton Kutcher decides to record his
thoughts and his life and his day and to

1458
01:18:58,521 --> 01:19:03,521
take it and uploaded to the web and you
could feel what it feels like to be him,

1459
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:07,310
you know,
or maybe someone who you would always

1460
01:19:07,311 --> 01:19:10,160
love to find out how they think,
you know,

1461
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:12,800
like maybe Chris Rock,
like a great comedian.

1462
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:14,900
Like how does Chris Rock look at the
world?

1463
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:16,100
Where's he coming up with material?

1464
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,250
Has This guy think?
How,

1465
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,220
what,
how does he feel about himself?

1466
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,570
You know,
like a,

1467
01:19:20,571 --> 01:19:24,080
a guy like Louis C K who say I'm very
self deprecating guy.

1468
01:19:24,081 --> 01:19:25,910
How's he feel about himself?
You know,

1469
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:29,570
maybe guy like Jon Jones,
so great fighter or Demetrius Mighty

1470
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:31,910
Mouse Johnson.
How does he feel about himself?

1471
01:19:31,911 --> 01:19:33,250
How does he think,
what does,

1472
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:36,410
what does it feel like to be him?
What does it feel like to be mighty

1473
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:38,690
mouse for a day?
What does it feel like to go through a

1474
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:41,120
workout?
You could actually feel it.

1475
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:44,660
You get experience it.
You could beat him for a short period of

1476
01:19:44,661 --> 01:19:48,170
time.
I think that is inevitable.

1477
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,320
I really do.
I think that has as inevitable as

1478
01:19:51,321 --> 01:19:52,790
recording,
uh,

1479
01:19:52,791 --> 01:19:57,380
a picture of your kid blowing out their
birthday cake and you watching a video

1480
01:19:57,381 --> 01:20:01,160
on your iphone when you're doing that,
when you're videotaping someone's

1481
01:20:01,161 --> 01:20:03,260
wedding,
when you're videotaping a sporting

1482
01:20:03,261 --> 01:20:04,640
event,
when you're holding your camera up at

1483
01:20:04,641 --> 01:20:09,000
the UFC and you're watching the fights,
you're capturing time.

1484
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:10,591
You,
you will,

1485
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:15,591
you are capturing an image of something.
We're so used to it.

1486
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:18,840
We don't,
we don't even understand how fucking

1487
01:20:18,841 --> 01:20:22,620
insane it is.
It is so insane that you could take

1488
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:26,220
something that's so small.
It's not even as thick as a deck of

1489
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:29,970
cards.
You take it out of your pocket and it

1490
01:20:29,971 --> 01:20:34,971
could film hours of shit hours.
You can capture hours of images and then

1491
01:20:37,201 --> 01:20:41,040
you show it to me and you could have
been on the other side of the world.

1492
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:46,250
You could be in New Zealand and you
could be filming some insane mountain

1493
01:20:48,031 --> 01:20:50,400
view that was in the movie,
the Hobbit,

1494
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:54,420
and it could be you and your friends and
your backpack in there and you're

1495
01:20:54,421 --> 01:20:59,280
laughing and joking and you make a video
and then you can send it to me through

1496
01:20:59,281 --> 01:21:04,281
the fucking air and it could reach my
phone on the other side of the planet in

1497
01:21:05,281 --> 01:21:06,330
seconds.

1498
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:10,560
This is nuts.
It's nuts.

1499
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:15,820
It is completely fucking bananas,
but we're really used to it and it

1500
01:21:17,011 --> 01:21:22,011
stands to reason to me that this ability
is only going to accelerate.

1501
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,880
Their only going to get better.
It's only going to get more,

1502
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:30,480
more in depth.
It's only going to get,

1503
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:34,920
the experience is not just going to be
visual right now it's visual and it's

1504
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:38,760
two dimensional is going to be virtual.
It's going to turn into a virtual

1505
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:41,040
experience.
Then it's going to be something that

1506
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:45,420
involves much more than just the simple
senses of sound and sight.

1507
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:46,650
You're going to have,
it's going to,

1508
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:49,890
there's going to be feeling,
there's going to be neurological

1509
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,920
responses.
There's going to be memory,

1510
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:55,530
there's going to be,
then it's going to be emotional.

1511
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:58,920
You're gonna be able to feel emotions.
I think we're going to be able to record

1512
01:21:58,921 --> 01:22:00,360
thoughts and ideas.

1513
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:05,360
And the same way we're able to encode
and record visual images like

1514
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:09,780
photographs or,
or audio like this podcast.

1515
01:22:09,781 --> 01:22:10,770
Like,
you know,

1516
01:22:10,771 --> 01:22:12,120
I'm sitting here right now.
What time is it?

1517
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:16,950
Six 30 for Friday,
July 29th in Atlanta.

1518
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:20,310
I'm recording this.
You might be listening to this a hundred

1519
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,650
years from now in the future.
And you might be saying,

1520
01:22:22,651 --> 01:22:26,040
whoa.
Like I was listening to this Alan Watts,

1521
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:28,890
uh,
recording the other day that was on

1522
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,770
universal basic income,
which is a,

1523
01:22:31,771 --> 01:22:33,300
a constant,
uh,

1524
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:36,350
subject right now.
It's been going on around the idea of a

1525
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:39,540
is you actually just gave people money
so that they could live.

1526
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:42,030
So I didn't have to worry about making a
living.

1527
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:45,570
It would open them up to a lot of other
possibilities and at this idea that

1528
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:49,230
putting people on welfare or the Dole,
it just makes them lazy,

1529
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:50,910
might not necessarily be true.

1530
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,030
And that it actually might be better if
we didn't look at it that way.

1531
01:22:54,031 --> 01:22:58,440
If we just looked at it the way of you,
once your basic needs are covered,

1532
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:01,770
then you're free to express yourself in
a much more natural way without

1533
01:23:01,771 --> 01:23:05,710
desperation.
And that desperation doesn't always mean

1534
01:23:05,711 --> 01:23:09,670
you're going to make the best decisions.
And it really would cost us less if we

1535
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:11,260
gave people money.
Okay.

1536
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:14,350
Anyway,
point being this is an Alan Watts,

1537
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:19,950
a discussion where Alan Watts was making
this speech about this from the 1960s so

1538
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:25,120
it was more than 50 years old.
Um,

1539
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:30,040
I think somewhere around 50 point being,
it's,

1540
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:35,430
it's entirely possible that this
recording that I'm making right now,

1541
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:39,970
someday somebody might listen to 50
years from now,

1542
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:41,890
a hundred years from now,
200 years from now,

1543
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:45,250
and they'll laugh the laugh at how wrong
I got it.

1544
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:50,490
Or maybe they'll laugh at how I called
it and we will be living in some sort of

1545
01:23:50,801 --> 01:23:55,801
a strange world where reality is not
something that you measure.

1546
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,890
You can't like take a ruler to it or you
know,

1547
01:23:59,891 --> 01:24:03,790
and measure the temperature of it or put
it on a scale.

1548
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:09,360
It might be something that exists in
some sort of a quasi reality setting,

1549
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:12,130
uh,
where it's,

1550
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,230
it's real,
you're experiencing it,

1551
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:19,440
but it doesn't exist in a physical form
that's entirely possible that that's our

1552
01:24:22,331 --> 01:24:26,230
future.
It's entirely possible that we through

1553
01:24:26,231 --> 01:24:31,231
technology,
figure out a way to create not just an

1554
01:24:31,781 --> 01:24:36,781
alternative dimension,
but infinite alternative dimensions,

1555
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:41,610
infinite alternative existences.
So this idea that we're just going to

1556
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:44,940
get to a certain point where we realize
that a,

1557
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:49,420
we could build a spaceship the size of
the empire state building and fucking

1558
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:52,810
shoot off to Alpha Centauri and set up
shop there and,

1559
01:24:52,811 --> 01:24:53,321
uh,
you know,

1560
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:56,140
find some snails and turn them into
people.

1561
01:24:56,650 --> 01:24:59,320
I don't think so.
I don't think we're going to be

1562
01:24:59,321 --> 01:25:00,154
traveling.

1563
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:03,040
I really,
I don't think that's the future.

1564
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,240
I think,
uh,

1565
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:07,870
I think we may for the next foreseeable
future,

1566
01:25:07,871 --> 01:25:11,710
for the foreseeable future,
we might be sending robots to Mars like

1567
01:25:11,711 --> 01:25:15,010
we're doing now and might send them off
to Pluto on to these other planets.

1568
01:25:15,011 --> 01:25:17,820
And we might get invaluable data about
the,

1569
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:19,810
the nature of our solar system.
And you know,

1570
01:25:19,811 --> 01:25:24,811
there's this planet that they think is
outside of Pluto's orbit it past the

1571
01:25:25,181 --> 01:25:27,370
Kuyper belt.
Now they're calling planted acts and

1572
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:30,580
people have talked about this forever.
There's some Chai and asked planted out

1573
01:25:30,581 --> 01:25:31,414
there.
That's,

1574
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:35,950
I think it's more than four times larger
than earth and they're pretty sure it

1575
01:25:35,951 --> 01:25:37,570
exists,
like 90 something percent.

1576
01:25:37,571 --> 01:25:38,404
Sure.
Yeah.

1577
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:41,350
That's all awesome and fascinating and
amazing and beautiful.

1578
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:44,980
But I don't know,
I have a feeling that our future doesn't

1579
01:25:44,981 --> 01:25:47,740
exist in a physical sense,
the way we think it does.

1580
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:51,880
I think we're married to this idea
because it's all we've ever known,

1581
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:56,680
but I don't necessarily think it's all
we're capable of.

1582
01:25:56,710 --> 01:26:01,710
I think it's entirely possible that one
day we might create a whole new world.

1583
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:09,380
And this also might be possible with the
advent of artificial intelligence.

1584
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:14,500
Artificial intelligence is another
fucking rabbit hole because if you want

1585
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:16,130
to,
you want to get your mind blown.

1586
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:17,840
Listened to.
Not,

1587
01:26:17,841 --> 01:26:22,841
I don't think it was the last one.
I think Sam Harris and I have talked

1588
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:24,640
about it twice.
Um,

1589
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:29,720
we talked about it on a think the last
podcast and maybe even more in depth the

1590
01:26:29,721 --> 01:26:32,720
podcast before it might be both of them.
I'd have to go back.

1591
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:35,390
Remember,
I've done more than 800 fucking podcast

1592
01:26:35,391 --> 01:26:37,730
now.
So even though my memory is pretty

1593
01:26:37,731 --> 01:26:40,370
decent,
I really lose track of which one was

1594
01:26:40,371 --> 01:26:42,230
what and what was happening when,
but,

1595
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:45,170
uh,
the point being,

1596
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:50,320
the conversation that I had with him
about artificial intelligence was a mind

1597
01:26:51,051 --> 01:26:55,850
blower,
a real mind blower where it's in my,

1598
01:26:55,851 --> 01:26:56,810
in my eyes.

1599
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,300
It's one of those things,
just like we're talking about

1600
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:05,030
technological innovation.
I think everyone would say everyone.

1601
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:09,380
I mean just it conservative
people that are dreamers.

1602
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,500
If we start talking about the potential
for the future,

1603
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:13,850
uh,
are,

1604
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,580
is there going to be innovation?
Yes.

1605
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,290
Everyone would say yes.
Everyone.

1606
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,650
Everyone would say yes.
If people don't blow themselves up,

1607
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:26,300
if we don't get hit by an asteroid,
if yellow stone doesn't explode and wipe

1608
01:27:26,301 --> 01:27:31,160
out everyone in North America,
will we continue to make better

1609
01:27:31,161 --> 01:27:33,230
electronics where we continue to
innovate,

1610
01:27:33,231 --> 01:27:36,320
where we will,
we continue to make new inventions?

1611
01:27:36,321 --> 01:27:38,330
Everybody would say yes.
Everybody.

1612
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,160
Well,
if that's the case,

1613
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:43,820
artificial intelligence is almost
inevitable.

1614
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,460
If it's a hundred years from now,
if it's 200 years from now,

1615
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:48,530
whatever it is,
one day,

1616
01:27:48,531 --> 01:27:53,240
eventually they're going to figure out a
way to make something that can think for

1617
01:27:53,241 --> 01:27:56,780
itself.
He Tesla has fucking cars that drive

1618
01:27:56,781 --> 01:27:57,230
themselves.

1619
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:01,400
Now you can press auto drive or whatever
the button is.

1620
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,890
He depressed and these fucking things
will drive.

1621
01:28:03,891 --> 01:28:05,750
They hit the brakes,
they make turns.

1622
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:09,920
They follow the navigation system.
They have sensors that detect cars.

1623
01:28:09,921 --> 01:28:11,780
They break at traffic.
I mean,

1624
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:15,740
it's fucking nuts and it's just crept up
on us.

1625
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:19,220
Nobody saw this coming 10 years ago.
Nobody thought in 10 years,

1626
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:21,500
nobody thought in 2006 10 years from
now,

1627
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:24,770
we're going to have drivable driverless
cars,

1628
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,990
cars that you take your hand off the
wheel.

1629
01:28:26,991 --> 01:28:30,680
There's a hilarious photo of a guy.
They snapped pictures of him on the

1630
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:32,720
highway,
I think it was outside of San Francisco

1631
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:36,530
where he was asleep,
asleep at the wheel going to work and

1632
01:28:36,531 --> 01:28:40,130
his car was driving down the highway.
This is,

1633
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,930
this is all new,
right,

1634
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:45,050
and what is it going to be like 10 years
from now?

1635
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:46,370
I don't think we know.

1636
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:49,700
I think we could guess.
I think we could have beautiful ideas,

1637
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:54,850
but I think when every new invention
gets created and every new door that

1638
01:28:55,851 --> 01:28:59,660
gets opened up by new technologies,
it,

1639
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:04,710
it creates the potential for a gang of
other new exponentially increasing new

1640
01:29:06,631 --> 01:29:11,370
technologies.
So with artificial intelligence,

1641
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:16,640
I think it's entirely possible that we
can literally create something that

1642
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:23,850
creates universes,
something that creates universes that

1643
01:29:23,851 --> 01:29:27,540
don't exist in a physical sense.
Like you go to the Moon,

1644
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:29,850
you pick up moon rocks,
it come back to earth,

1645
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:35,180
but rather something that exists in
another dimension that we find portals

1646
01:29:36,361 --> 01:29:41,361
or gateways or that we find frequencies.
I've always thought that it's,

1647
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:47,030
it's possible that planets themselves or
that a rather reality itself is like a

1648
01:29:48,181 --> 01:29:53,181
station on the dial.
And I've read that scientists believe

1649
01:29:53,311 --> 01:29:58,311
that there are at least 11 dimensions.
I don't know how they understand this.

1650
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:00,140
I don't know how they,
they,

1651
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:04,350
that's when they get to those,
you know those yellow legal notepads

1652
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:06,200
where those guys scribble shit down on
it.

1653
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:08,370
Your little,
what the fuck is that?

1654
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:12,120
But you have to be a theoretical
physicist to in order to understand what

1655
01:30:12,121 --> 01:30:17,121
the fuck they're writing.
I think those guys have come up with

1656
01:30:17,641 --> 01:30:22,641
some equation that they all agree upon
where they believe that it is entirely

1657
01:30:23,191 --> 01:30:27,660
possible that there are 11 dimensions at
least.

1658
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:32,780
And this is today in 2016 right?
If you ask scientists in 1955 they

1659
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:34,321
probably look at you,
look,

1660
01:30:34,321 --> 01:30:37,260
you have fucking three heads.
That's a blink of an eye.

1661
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:42,330
1955 compared to 2016 it is a blink of
an eye.

1662
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:47,690
It seems like 60 plus years for us.
But it ain't shit in terms of the world

1663
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,630
in terms of human history and in terms
of the,

1664
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:52,613
you know,
the,

1665
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:55,920
the evolution of this bizarre talking
monkey.

1666
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:58,530
It's a,
it's nothing.

1667
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:02,700
And in that time things have changed in
spectacular ways.

1668
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:08,570
I think it's entirely possible that
through especially the invention and

1669
01:31:09,211 --> 01:31:13,290
innovation of artificial intelligence
and its ability to innovate,

1670
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:18,470
it's ability to improve upon ideas that
human beings have created.

1671
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:21,090
Cause that was one of the most mind
blowing parts about the Sam Harris'

1672
01:31:21,091 --> 01:31:26,091
podcast was he said that within weeks
they will be able to do 10,000 plus

1673
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:31,710
years of what would take us as far as
innovation.

1674
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:37,010
So the world will change so fast once
artificial intelligence is,

1675
01:31:37,401 --> 01:31:41,130
is when once it goes alive,
when skynet goes live,

1676
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:46,290
the world's going to change so much that
it's almost impossible for us to

1677
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:50,310
understand.
It's impossible for us to guess I'm

1678
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:52,830
standing up here now cause I'm Kinda
freaking myself out

1679
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:57,840
and
my throat is getting a little scratchy.

1680
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:03,190
That's what I think about the Fermi
paradox.

1681
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:08,700
I think.
I think that we're going to outgrow this

1682
01:32:09,221 --> 01:32:11,320
idea of being somewhere in a physical
sense.

1683
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:16,630
And I think that if there are aliens,
they're going to contact us through our

1684
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:19,150
own minds.
They're going to contact us through

1685
01:32:19,151 --> 01:32:20,650
dreams.
They,

1686
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:23,590
they,
I mean aliens might exist in the form of

1687
01:32:23,591 --> 01:32:28,591
imagination.
Imagination itself might be like a kind

1688
01:32:29,501 --> 01:32:31,140
of energy,
like a kind,

1689
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:34,360
almost like a life form.
If you look around at the world,

1690
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:38,130
obviously you imagination is something
that you know,

1691
01:32:38,150 --> 01:32:41,950
it comes out of the brain and people
create things and it's just,

1692
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:44,290
you know the idea that it's a light
farms ridiculous.

1693
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:45,071
I get it.
Yes,

1694
01:32:45,071 --> 01:32:49,210
you're right.
But the imagination is responsible for

1695
01:32:49,211 --> 01:32:52,270
every single physical thing that human
beings have ever created.

1696
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:56,320
This building that I'm in right now came
about because of the imagination.

1697
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:01,840
The phone that I'm talking on came about
because the imagination without the

1698
01:33:01,961 --> 01:33:04,960
thought of these ideas,
without someone saying,

1699
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:07,720
hmm,
what would happen if we took this mud

1700
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:10,450
and turned it into a square and then
dried it out?

1701
01:33:10,451 --> 01:33:11,890
Can we make a brick?
Ooh,

1702
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:14,020
and then if I stack a brick on top of a
break,

1703
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:15,190
dude,
I'm making a wall.

1704
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:20,610
And that all came out of the mind.
It came out of an idea.

1705
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:26,820
How amazing would it be if we found out
that those ideas themselves were alive,

1706
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:34,750
that that is the way these lifeforms
express themselves much.

1707
01:33:34,751 --> 01:33:39,751
What much like the way disease expresses
itself inside your body.

1708
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:42,760
Like when you catch a cold,
right,

1709
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:46,630
you,
you have a life form that's growing and

1710
01:33:46,631 --> 01:33:50,770
feeding off of you and your body's out
of balance.

1711
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:54,910
Your immune system is battling this
virus,

1712
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:57,760
this dizzy.
You could look at it on a microscope.

1713
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:58,960
Ooh,
look,

1714
01:33:58,961 --> 01:34:02,440
it's the staff virus or it's the flu.
Oh,

1715
01:34:02,441 --> 01:34:03,910
it's malaria.
Ooh,

1716
01:34:03,911 --> 01:34:05,620
he's got the malaria virus.
Well,

1717
01:34:05,621 --> 01:34:07,600
what is that thing?
Well,

1718
01:34:07,630 --> 01:34:11,650
that thing is a life form.
It's some sort of an existing living

1719
01:34:11,651 --> 01:34:14,740
thing that's trying to multiply,
multiply,

1720
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:17,380
and grow.
And ultimately it would like to keep,

1721
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:20,920
it would like to kill your body.
It would like to take your body over and

1722
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:24,550
it would love to spread itself to a
bunch of other people and,

1723
01:34:24,551 --> 01:34:26,170
uh,
take out a bunch of folks.

1724
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:30,420
And that's what happens every year with
the flu or every year with malaria.

1725
01:34:30,421 --> 01:34:33,520
And if you want a harrowing tale of what
it's like to that malaria,

1726
01:34:33,521 --> 01:34:37,150
listen to my friend Justin Wren,
who's been on the podcast many times,

1727
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:39,220
uh,
who was just on the last episode,

1728
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:44,221
who goes to the Congo regularly to uh,
build wells for the pygmy.

1729
01:34:44,641 --> 01:34:49,641
It's just an amazing guide,
just beautiful person who is doing this

1730
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:52,480
incredible thing and helping these
people.

1731
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,360
But some motherfuckers caught malaria
three times now.

1732
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,640
It's scary shit.
It's malaria is some sort of a weird

1733
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:00,200
life form,
right?

1734
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:05,480
What if ideas where lifeforms,
they're just life forms that exist in a

1735
01:35:05,481 --> 01:35:10,190
nonphysical way and you can make
yourself more accessible.

1736
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:14,150
You can catch these ideas better.
You catch these life forms,

1737
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:18,920
you can catch these things that will
ultimately lead to the transformation of

1738
01:35:18,921 --> 01:35:22,940
the very world around you.
They've developed air conditioning.

1739
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:26,570
These ideas have made heat.
They figured out how to harness fire.

1740
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:30,560
They figured out how to take rubber
tires and put them around metal wheels,

1741
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:34,880
attach it to a frame and allow you to
fall asleep and side of as it takes you

1742
01:35:34,881 --> 01:35:38,300
to work.
That's all because of imagination.

1743
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:44,080
Knows that that imagination is something
that you can't measure.

1744
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:46,820
It's not a physical thing.
You can't,

1745
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:48,370
you can't show it.
You know,

1746
01:35:48,371 --> 01:35:50,030
you don't take,
I'll go a litmus test.

1747
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:53,720
You can't go to the store and hey,
I tested positive for imagination.

1748
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:54,680
No,
it's,

1749
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,070
it's just there and you access it and
you,

1750
01:35:57,071 --> 01:36:00,020
you,
you sit around your daydream and you lay

1751
01:36:00,021 --> 01:36:02,480
on your back in the grass and you come
up with an idea.

1752
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:06,020
What the fuck is that?
We don't know.

1753
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:08,510
We don't know.
We totally take it for granted.

1754
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:13,670
But if you look around this fucking
spectacular world that you see in front

1755
01:36:13,671 --> 01:36:15,650
of you when you step outside of your
house,

1756
01:36:15,651 --> 01:36:19,340
this bizarre world.
But if you lived in a,

1757
01:36:19,341 --> 01:36:23,150
in a natural world,
if you lived in a jungle or if you lived

1758
01:36:23,151 --> 01:36:25,580
in a,
in a mountain setting and you had never

1759
01:36:25,581 --> 01:36:28,310
seen human civilization,
you were confronted with it for the

1760
01:36:28,311 --> 01:36:31,430
first time,
you would freak the fuck out.

1761
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:36,630
You will be like,
what kind of bizarre thing is creating

1762
01:36:37,671 --> 01:36:42,671
these enormous structures with a glass
and stone and on a scale that is,

1763
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:49,870
it is impossible to comprehend a human
being creating a skyscraper one person.

1764
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:52,911
No,
no,

1765
01:36:52,911 --> 01:36:53,870
no.
They had to work together.

1766
01:36:53,871 --> 01:36:55,460
How many people?
Hundreds.

1767
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:56,480
Okay.
How'd they do it?

1768
01:36:56,481 --> 01:36:57,980
They have metal.
They use machines.

1769
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:00,050
What machines?
Yeah,

1770
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:00,560
yeah,
yeah.

1771
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,810
They have combustion engines with that.
Well,

1772
01:37:02,811 --> 01:37:07,550
they're explosions controlled explosions
inside of a metal structure that that

1773
01:37:07,551 --> 01:37:12,551
powers these gears and these gears can
lift up things thousands of pounds and

1774
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:14,850
carry them through the air and then
they,

1775
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:18,080
they put these glass walls on top of
these buildings.

1776
01:37:18,081 --> 01:37:22,340
Like what the fuck?
This is all because of the imagination

1777
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:24,320
and this,
this,

1778
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:28,520
this idea that the imagination is just
some sort of like,

1779
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:30,470
oh,
he's imagining things old,

1780
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:31,940
silly.
He's a dreamer,

1781
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:34,220
has been kind of putting our heads since
we were young,

1782
01:37:34,221 --> 01:37:37,040
because we're,
we're taught to be pragmatic or we

1783
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:39,410
talked to talk,
to be disciplined and taught to,

1784
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:40,371
to,
you know,

1785
01:37:40,371 --> 01:37:44,480
to go out there and get things done and
pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

1786
01:37:44,481 --> 01:37:48,500
And all these,
like a hardcore sort of a,

1787
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:53,810
I dunno what the word I'm looking for,
organic ways of looking at productivity

1788
01:37:53,811 --> 01:37:58,490
in life,
but ultimately this imagination is going

1789
01:37:58,491 --> 01:38:03,491
to lead us to create something that can
change the very nature of what life is.

1790
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:11,520
So if that made any sense at all to
anybody but me,

1791
01:38:11,521 --> 01:38:12,660
I'd be fucking shocked.

1792
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:17,220
But that's my answer.
God Damn,

1793
01:38:17,221 --> 01:38:19,890
that was a long ass fucking answer.
Um,

1794
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:23,130
is almost seven o'clock here and I got
to leave soon.

1795
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:28,160
So maybe I'll answer one more
thoughts on the Putin,

1796
01:38:29,221 --> 01:38:31,770
Russia,
trump implications around the democratic

1797
01:38:31,771 --> 01:38:32,880
party.
Wiki leaks,

1798
01:38:32,881 --> 01:38:35,700
email reveals.
I think that they were saying that

1799
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:38,880
people were saying that trump was going
to get in trouble because he told the

1800
01:38:38,881 --> 01:38:43,881
Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails
or hack the democratic,

1801
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:49,170
um,
party wikileak emails.

1802
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:52,290
That's ridiculous.
That is really ridiculous.

1803
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:54,840
I think that is one of the dumbest
things.

1804
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:00,660
This idea that trump should somehow or
another be accountable and held

1805
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:05,040
accountable for espionage.
How about the fact that that the

1806
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:08,070
Democrats were plotting against one of
their own?

1807
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:13,170
How about the fact that we're working
towards getting Hillary Clinton to be

1808
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:17,760
the the nominee for the party.
They're working towards that like

1809
01:39:17,761 --> 01:39:18,960
they're supposed to be impartial.

1810
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:23,400
He's a Democrat too,
and they were actively trying to make

1811
01:39:23,401 --> 01:39:26,770
her
be the,

1812
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:31,810
the representative for the Party and
then when the woman who has to step down

1813
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:36,750
because the emails,
she has to step down because it's

1814
01:39:36,751 --> 01:39:40,530
revealed that they were actively
plotting to get Bernie sanders in his,

1815
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:43,320
or excuse me,
Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders.

1816
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,600
She,
after she steps down,

1817
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:49,500
immediately gets hired by Hillary
Clinton like immediately.

1818
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:51,540
It's,
it's so transparent.

1819
01:39:51,541 --> 01:39:56,070
It's hilarious.
I think what I was saying earlier that

1820
01:39:56,130 --> 01:39:59,790
one of the good things about a guy like
Gary Johnson is we're realizing how

1821
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:03,750
stupid this fucking two party system is.
We're being hosed.

1822
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:07,140
Whether you're a hillary supporter or
whether you're a trump supporter,

1823
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:10,290
you have to admit that they're not
ideal.

1824
01:40:10,410 --> 01:40:13,800
Neither one of those people is ideal.
You see all those people that are at the

1825
01:40:13,801 --> 01:40:18,390
Democratic convention and they're all
smiling and laughing and they don't

1826
01:40:18,391 --> 01:40:21,690
really believe she's ideal.
They believe this is all we have right

1827
01:40:21,691 --> 01:40:25,890
now.
Hillary Clinton was giving a speech and

1828
01:40:25,891 --> 01:40:30,690
her fucking husband bill fell asleep.
He fell asleep.

1829
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:34,140
I mean,
apparently he's not in good health right

1830
01:40:34,141 --> 01:40:36,660
now.
It's not doing so hot.

1831
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:41,730
But he's sitting there in the audience
and if he,

1832
01:40:41,731 --> 01:40:44,820
if he's in such bad shape that he can't
stay awake,

1833
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:47,990
he should be in bed somewhere.
He,

1834
01:40:48,130 --> 01:40:53,130
he fell asleep in the audience.
That's how fucking boring and stupid

1835
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:54,093
these things are.

1836
01:40:55,360 --> 01:41:00,360
And it's a hose job and it's a hose job
that I think is just going to be here

1837
01:41:00,671 --> 01:41:03,850
for a little while longer.
It's going to be like powdered wigs.

1838
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:04,870
It's,
it's,

1839
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:09,870
it's a nonsense way to run a nation of
300 million informed people.

1840
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:15,730
There's too many of us now.
There's too many of us and people know

1841
01:41:15,731 --> 01:41:20,650
too much.
It's not 18 hundreds where you needed

1842
01:41:20,651 --> 01:41:24,220
this sort of representative government
because you couldn't get to those people

1843
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:26,740
and they couldn't get their into their
opinion to you.

1844
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,690
That's,
it's not the case anymore.

1845
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:32,890
We live in a different world.
Um,

1846
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:34,570
that's it.
I'm going to end,

1847
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:36,190
I'm gonna end this fucking thing.
Um,

1848
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:40,000
I'm going to try to get Ian Mccall on
and either I'll attach it to this

1849
01:41:40,001 --> 01:41:45,001
podcast or put it on a second one
depending on how much Ian and I talk,

1850
01:41:47,141 --> 01:41:52,141
but this one has gone for an hour and 34
minutes,

1851
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:55,060
which is I was like,
what the fuck am I going to talk about?

1852
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,040
Meanwhile,
I couldn't shut the fuck up.

1853
01:41:57,250 --> 01:42:00,610
And it's weird when I'm doing these
things because you're trying to not be

1854
01:42:00,611 --> 01:42:04,120
conscious of the fact that you're doing
why sayings started.

1855
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:06,370
Just trying to like let the thoughts
flow.

1856
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:10,240
But in the meantime it's like you have
to resist the urge to think about the

1857
01:42:10,241 --> 01:42:15,241
fact that you're talking and that you're
talking into a phone and that you're

1858
01:42:15,341 --> 01:42:19,600
trying not to fuck it up and you're
trying to be as honest and transparent

1859
01:42:19,601 --> 01:42:22,360
about your thoughts as possible while
still make an entertaining.

1860
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:26,380
Don't say too many ums.
Don't ramble too much.

1861
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:30,430
It's weird.
I've done these before in the past,

1862
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,410
but I haven't done one like this a long
time.

1863
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,590
It just shows you how talented bill burr
is.

1864
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:38,800
Cause that fucking guy does one of these
every Monday and every Thursday.

1865
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:40,660
Bill Burr,
if you haven't heard his podcast,

1866
01:42:40,661 --> 01:42:41,200
it's awesome.

1867
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:43,750
It's the bill burr Monday morning
podcast,

1868
01:42:43,751 --> 01:42:45,850
but he also does a Thursday version of
it,

1869
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:49,450
which I think he calls the Thursday
afternoon and Monday morning podcast.

1870
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:52,450
But,
and honestly,

1871
01:42:52,451 --> 01:42:53,770
bill is,
um,

1872
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:58,180
he's a good friend of mine and a
brilliant comedian and he's also a guy

1873
01:42:58,190 --> 01:43:01,100
who's singular in his focus.
And a,

1874
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:04,150
I really admire him as a comic and it's
one of the things I was thinking about

1875
01:43:04,151 --> 01:43:07,030
when I was thinking that maybe I would
stop doing commentary.

1876
01:43:07,031 --> 01:43:09,730
I'm like,
this fucking guy just does stand up.

1877
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:10,810
I mean,
that's what he does.

1878
01:43:10,930 --> 01:43:13,000
He just does a stand up and look at the
results.

1879
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:15,340
They're amazing.
He's always got new shit.

1880
01:43:15,341 --> 01:43:18,310
He's always killing it.
I love watching his act.

1881
01:43:18,311 --> 01:43:19,930
He's Oh,
consistently funny,

1882
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:22,840
but he's very singular in its focus.
And,

1883
01:43:22,841 --> 01:43:24,040
um,
anyway,

1884
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,840
I'm rambling.
Uh,

1885
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:27,520
Bill Burr,
Monday morning podcast.

1886
01:43:27,521 --> 01:43:28,630
Check it out.
It's awesome.

1887
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:31,240
If you haven't heard of bill before as a
comic,

1888
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,790
he's not just one of the best alive
today.

1889
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:36,550
He's one of the best average.
He's one of my all time favorite standup

1890
01:43:36,551 --> 01:43:40,120
comedians.
So with that,

1891
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,550
let's end this fucking thing.
So,

1892
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:43,900
uh,
thanks for tuning in.

1893
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:44,541
Um,
I'm,

1894
01:43:44,541 --> 01:43:48,970
I may do this again or I might be
completely fucking burnt out or I might

1895
01:43:48,971 --> 01:43:53,960
freak myself out about how God damn I
sound when I start rambling about

1896
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:59,020
artificial intelligence and the,
