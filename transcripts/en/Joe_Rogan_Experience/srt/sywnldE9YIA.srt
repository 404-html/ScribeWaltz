1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:09,010
The joe rogan experience.
Hey everybody.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,640
We're doing a podcast tomorrow from a
west side Barbell Louie sentence.

3
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:19,830
So,
uh,

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,810
we decided to check our set up.
You'll have to move in.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,850
Let's take care of what touching,
touching the table.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,051
We,
uh,

7
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:30,051
so we decided to do a practice run here.
Young Tony Hinchcliffe is here.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,860
Hello?
Doing surprise.

9
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,110
It's me.
How long is it's Tony?

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,230
And of course a young Jamie Vernon.
Hey,

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,210
and I'm old Joe Rogan,
Columbus,

12
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:46,490
Ohio.
Just got done having a nice meal and uh,

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,210
talked to a bunch of shit.
And so we said,

14
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:49,950
hey,
we should go do a fucking podcast.

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,800
So here we are.
Now we're silent.

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,150
It's all happened until we talked
ourselves out.

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,390
We're talking about this woman.
Uh,

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,100
we didn't talk about too much,
but we should.

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,780
This woman who was the woman that
Hillary Clinton brought up,

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,050
uh,
during the trump debate because she was

21
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:15,000
saying that Donald Trump humiliated this
woman because he shamed her and

22
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:17,670
humiliated her because she gained weight
while she was a missile.

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,040
Olympia,
I missed this.

24
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,010
I was in the bathroom and you guys had
this time.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,460
She got up to 170 pounds according to
trump,

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,390
she went up from like one 20 to one 70.
According to him,

27
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,940
probably not right.
It's probably gained like 30 pounds.

28
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,640
But apparently she really did gain a
fuck load of weight.

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,680
And um,
and Hillary Clinton made this big deal

30
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:43,980
about like how awful it was.
He did that to her and then they had

31
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:47,640
these commercials already planned for
the next day.

32
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,040
So they launched these commercials the
next day.

33
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,080
And the commercials they show this
woman,

34
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:55,680
she's speaking any Spanish.
It talking about Donald Trump is

35
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:59,100
terrible what he did to me.
He made me feel bad.

36
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:00,660
He made me,
he was scared.

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,840
So then after that comes out,
people start researching her.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,300
They find out that she drove a getaway
car in a murder.

39
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:14,040
That she threatened a drudge cause the
judge who is going after her boyfriend

40
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,980
at the time that she drove away in the
getaway car that she threatened,

41
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:18,960
the judge said that she was going to
kill the judge.

42
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,000
She had an elite,
uh,

43
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,410
illegitimate baby with a Mexican kingpin
drug dealer.

44
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,210
All of the Mexican drug cartel kingpins
came to the baby's Christening.

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,550
Wow.
Then she went on big brother.

46
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,200
Okay.
Big Brother.

47
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,070
She was engaged to some baseball player.
Went on big brother and fuck some other

48
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:42,270
guy on the show while the cameras were
on her and she was yelling out in

49
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,200
Spanish that he has a magnificent
caught.

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,290
Wow.
The same lady that I used in our

51
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,460
commercial,
so then they have her on cnn,

52
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:54,900
my ga,
so Anderson Cooper interviews or on CNN

53
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,010
and Anderson Cooper says some people are
saying that you threatened a judge and

54
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,310
that you drove the getaway car.
Like is this your saying?

55
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,590
Everybody have a pass.
Okay.

56
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,380
I'm not angel.
I met a bad person,

57
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,320
but they had tried to take away from
what he did.

58
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,330
What he did was wrong.
Okay.

59
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,660
What I did was 20 years ago,
what he did was 20 years ago to heal.

60
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,780
All we did was calling fat.

61
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,700
Yeah.
But in his defense when she probably

62
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:23,930
was,
she got fat.

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,880
You see these pictures of her.
She definitely got fat,

64
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,540
but you know,
ordinarily that's a very rude thing to

65
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,450
do.
But when your job is to be a

66
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:36,650
professional hot chick,
it's like if you just decide,

67
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,400
say like if you're a model for like a
shaving cream,

68
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,400
like give you like your,
your whole thing is about your legs and

69
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,270
you're showing your legs.
Like I touched the,

70
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:50,360
I'm sorry,
but your things about your just sleek,

71
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:51,740
smooth legs and you're like,
you know what?

72
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:53,720
Fuck it.
I'm letting these bitches grow.

73
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,793
I never was like,
hey,

74
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,970
um,
you can't,

75
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,120
you job is to have sleek,
smooth legs.

76
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,270
Fuck that.

77
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,070
You're known for your nice flakes.
Yeah.

78
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,280
She's known for being a professional,
attractive woman.

79
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,480
Any it he shouldn't objectify women.
That is the whole point of being mizell

80
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,100
Limpia

81
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,590
so hillary paid her to,
obviously if she's an anti trump course

82
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,370
then that means he already paid her.
Right.

83
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,020
Um,
might not be money.

84
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,100
It might just be attention because it
gave her the opportunity to get back in

85
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:27,410
the limelight.
Apparently she's a giant attention

86
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:28,244
whore.
Gotcha.

87
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,250
I saw some class year or something.
I think she wrote a book.

88
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,000
Thanks.
So about the Donald Trump where your

89
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,390
fat,
we were looking at up,

90
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,540
they all have a past.
We all want to have a pass.

91
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,380
Okay.
It's really funny you should fucking say

92
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:42,840
it.

93
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,510
One thing I noticed the other day was
this commercial,

94
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:48,930
the Anti Trump Hillary.
It's a pro hit this message approved by

95
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:53,610
Hillary Clinton commercial where it's
all the compiler nation of all the worst

96
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:58,170
things that trump said over the past
year or whatever and um,

97
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,710
and it,
and it literally his voice and the clip

98
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:03,540
of him doing all these things and you
know,

99
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:07,350
Mexicans are rapists and murderers.
All the little soundbites and the

100
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:08,770
commercial goes,
uh,

101
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,070
and there's,
it goes back to little kids back and

102
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:14,100
forth,
like pictures a little kids and it then

103
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:16,920
it goes,
is this what you want your kids to see?

104
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,090
And I was watching this commercial and
it was like the middle of the day and

105
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm thinking of myself,
you paid to put,

106
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,020
you're putting that stuff out there.
That's your commercial.

107
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,630
Yeah.
That all played once you just put that

108
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,210
out there for the kids to see and over
and over again.

109
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,440
Right.
Then the whole commercial,

110
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,020
it's like,
is this what you want your kids to see?

111
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,930
And it's like you just spend 30 million
bucks on that commercial.

112
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:40,730
Right,
right,

113
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,870
right.
But in her defense,

114
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:43,790
you know,
this is what you kids just wanted to see

115
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,980
as the leader as like their role model.
Hang on.

116
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,470
As the leader of the free world

117
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,370
comp is biting his tongue,
we all know it.

118
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,140
Once he drops that blow job card,
the whole world explodes.

119
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:58,110
He's sitting on like a clothes or

120
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,440
liking comedian Lewinsky cards.
Oh,

121
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,540
you'll be instantly they're telling him
not to do it.

122
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,750
Apparently they're trying to talk to him
to say,

123
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:07,670
do not bring up the Monica Lewinsky
stuff.

124
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,820
Cause he in the post press conference
thing,

125
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,710
he was saying how,
you know,

126
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:13,341
I,
I'm,

127
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:17,010
I'm very proud of myself that I did.
I didn't bring up Bill Clinton and his,

128
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,260
his dalliances.

129
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,210
I don't even think he has to mention
Bill Clinton.

130
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:23,980
I don't,
I don't even know if he had even said

131
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:25,810
those exact words like I think he's just
like,

132
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:30,070
let's just say there's a lot of things
that I'm not talking about that I could

133
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:33,130
maybe bringing up.
I could bring up that wouldn't be good

134
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:35,020
for her.
I don't need to say what they are.

135
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:35,890
You know what they are.

136
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,660
I have a winning temperament.
One thing about me,

137
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,470
I have a winning temperament.
Everyone knows this,

138
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,110
these debates that are whole areas,
but what's really funny is they both

139
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:49,740
sucks so hard that all this dirt that
comes out about them,

140
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,920
it's like no big deal.
Can we do a fight companion for the

141
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:54,990
next,
what we're talking about doing that?

142
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:57,120
We were talking about that if I'm in
town,

143
00:06:57,121 --> 00:06:59,310
if I'm not working during the next one,
we're going to,

144
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,080
we're going to hook something up.
There's two more,

145
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,210
so two more.
Okay.

146
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,820
There's one we're going to need to bring
someone legitimate end to like andy

147
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:07,110
stump wants come in.
My,

148
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:09,260
in my friend,
former navy seal and Andy,

149
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,400
he'll be,
he'll probably come into and maybe we

150
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:14,550
bring in someone else that like knows
Paula.

151
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,940
I'll drop some hot puns on that one too.
Yes,

152
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,400
you're good for that.
But who knows politics like really well

153
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,640
at Fitzsimons does.
He'd probably be good at that,

154
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:24,090
right?
Yeah.

155
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,100
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

156
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,190
Who else did you see some of the,
there's a conspiracy talked.

157
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,930
I was like,
this was going on during the debate

158
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,130
first was like she was,
has,

159
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:35,170
she had an earpiece fed stuff when I saw
last night was that uh,

160
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,770
she got caught scratching my face like
this six times and they were signals to

161
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,440
Lester Holt to like hit me,
hit it with a Zinger now,

162
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,330
like you're saying something and she,
Oh,

163
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,490
and then next would be like something
for like a pre predisposed talking point

164
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:50,570
for it to get out.

165
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,050
Well trump was saying that the,
the Lester Holt Guy,

166
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,340
the narrator,
what was he,

167
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,420
the announcer which call a,
that the moderator was against him and

168
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:01,510
he's like,
it was a bad deal,

169
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,940
was a bad deal.
You know,

170
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,640
it was a rig d microphone.
He says Mike was fucked up.

171
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,040
That's where digital is.
I heard them loud and clear at home,

172
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,460
but he caught it,
caught him on some real shit,

173
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:13,560
like the fact that trump supported the
Iraq war,

174
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,900
and even if you only said it on Howard
stern it,

175
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,500
which is apparently where he said it,
he only said,

176
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,130
you know,

177
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,860
break that down.
I guess what he said it in passing the

178
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:24,980
kind of statement like,
uh,

179
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,913
yeah,
sure.

180
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,761
Right,
so we're,

181
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:27,151
we're like,
what?

182
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:28,320
I was heard someone said,
I didn't hear.

183
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,040
Yeah,
you gotta be careful about things like

184
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,730
that because if you do one day plan on
running for president,

185
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,380
you can't just say,
yeah,

186
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,930
sure,
I support your back war and say,

187
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:40,300
I never supported that war.

188
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,080
It's an interesting thing where it
almost seems it's everything backwards

189
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:49,120
helps him.
Every time he messes up,

190
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,380
it sort of helps him.

191
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,740
I don't think this time it dead,
he looked bad.

192
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,133
I thought he,

193
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,730
and I'm not picking sides here,
I'm just totally judging the debate.

194
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,940
I think that the fact that people are
even wondering who won or who did good

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,750
means,
that's a huge victory for

196
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,780
trump.
I don't think people are wondering.

197
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,900
I think the polls really pretty
overwhelmingly on her side.

198
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,210
I think it was like 70% of the people
pull or 68% of the people polled thought

199
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:19,960
she won.
I thought she won,

200
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,310
but in his defense I didn't see the
beginning.

201
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,520
Apparently he did really well in the
beginning and she did really well.

202
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,500
You know,
one of the things that she said that I

203
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,960
thought was really crazy,
like she was going on about this thing

204
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:35,310
about him calling women pigs and all
these different things and that he said,

205
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,270
uh,
something about women being pregnant and

206
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,150
working.
I forget,

207
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,810
I forget what that quote was,
but one of the weird one was he said

208
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:47,580
that women should only get paid as much
as men if they earn it,

209
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,183
which,

210
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,001
yeah,
yeah,

211
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:52,050
that's what I said.
I,

212
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,220
I had it playing.
We were getting ready to do kill Tony

213
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,950
and the belly room and,
and we,

214
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,620
Josh Martin had his phone plugged in to
the overall speakers in the room.

215
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,020
So like the whole room,
it's empty.

216
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,500
It's just me and Josh just setting up
and stuff and you're playing at night,

217
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:10,020
literally set out loud,
you're damn right.

218
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,640
Or whatever it was.
I remember that part.

219
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:12,380
Exactly.

220
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,340
Well imagine you just said the opposite.
The men should only get paid as much as

221
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:18,500
women if they earn it and everybody
would go,

222
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:19,580
yeah,
well that makes sense.

223
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,440
But the idea that women should somehow
know they get paid as much as men if

224
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:26,250
they don't earn it.
Like,

225
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,570
I mean maybe we should like find the
exact quote here.

226
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:33,030
Let me find the exact quote.
I think he gets taken out of context,

227
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,190
not a good speaker.
Even though he speaks a lot in public.

228
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:40,340
I just think he's not good at
articulating the things he actually

229
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:41,500
means or wants to say.

230
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,620
And I think when the media does take him
out of context,

231
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:48,430
and Ben's what he says a little bit,
but people notice that.

232
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,160
And then when he does say some crazy
stuff,

233
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,650
I think that that only helps him when
that happens because it's like,

234
00:10:56,651 --> 00:10:57,760
oh,
here they go again.

235
00:10:57,761 --> 00:10:58,560
Ben Didn't trump,

236
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,240
I'm stuck here.
I think he likes her.

237
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,830
Right?
Even though it's going to happen to

238
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,753
cause he's not complaining.
Yeah.

239
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,280
I'm telling you.
If he is down in the third debate,

240
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,830
you know he's given it time.
Now he's playing a strategy,

241
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,490
but if he loses the second debate and it
gets down to that third debate,

242
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,690
he's going to drop that Bill Clinton
blow job shit out of me.

243
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,380
Nobody cares anymore.
Do they?

244
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,980
About that stuff.
You know?

245
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:23,210
It's interesting like immediately the
first hits when it's what Hillary and

246
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:27,650
trump on women salon.com right away.
Here's why it's wrong.

247
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,030
Here's why it's terrible.

248
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,850
I mean if he just said,
if trump said the words in succession,

249
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:38,830
like the only reason you ever became
secretary of state was because your

250
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,190
husband got a blow job in office.
You know what I mean?

251
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:45,430
Like if he went for it,
I mean,

252
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,120
do you think you could ever do that
though?

253
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,320
Can you really go for it like that?
Can you that

254
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,090
this election is different.
Everything that we've ever seen before.

255
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,620
So I think the ground rules are just
getting made and I think he'll do

256
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:02,800
anything to get the maximum amount of
press out of this.

257
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,540
Of course,
my computer just froze.

258
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,150
That's what happens when you start
talking shit about your computer and it

259
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:10,660
said you need a new one fucking thing.
Just locked right up.

260
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,460
Do that.
But that's what happens when you talk

261
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:15,010
shit about Hillary.
It's also what happens when you go to

262
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,183
salon dog,

263
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,740
all your emails or deleting themselves
right now you're talking about Hillary

264
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,480
too.

265
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,090
Well,
that was the other thing that's kind of

266
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:25,370
crazy.
It's like how many emails she's deleted

267
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,440
and she's like,
why won't you release your tax returns?

268
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,660
Excuse me,
that you deleted 30,000 fucking yeah.

269
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,710
How about you release you God damn
emails,

270
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,640
all of that.
How about you release the transcripts of

271
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:42,410
those conversations that you got paid
$250,000 an hour to speak in front of

272
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:43,460
those bankers.
How about you?

273
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,630
How about you do that?
Like,

274
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,540
what are you talking about?
Me,

275
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,430
me

276
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,160
may release.
It's very bizarre.

277
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,820
It's very bizarre.
That email things crazy.

278
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,630
She was like a hotmail account or
something.

279
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,493
She's,

280
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,370
yeah,
it is very strange man.

281
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,100
It's all of,
it's very strange.

282
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,750
You know what else is very strange?
Well,

283
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,810
there's a a bunch of things that are
very strange about it all,

284
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,110
but the email stuff is like,
you didn't know that you were deleting

285
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:17,630
all those emails or you just did it.
Like how's that?

286
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,690
Like you're not allowed to do that.
That's illegal.

287
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,300
That's highly illegal there.
When we had Mike Baker,

288
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,430
the former CIA guy on the podcast,
he's like,

289
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:28,400
all I know is if I did that I would go
to jail.

290
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,470
It's like I'd be in jail if I did that.

291
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,930
I don't remember who I discussed in this
part of it,

292
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:36,380
but is there any way that what the email
thing,

293
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,820
like what does she's in her seventies,
right or close to it that she's just,

294
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,500
uh,
not,

295
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,100
I guess competent might be the word.
She doesn't understand what's going on

296
00:13:46,101 --> 00:13:48,830
with email.
Like is there any way it was in college?

297
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,180
She gets it.
She looks at it weird or like how people

298
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:54,320
look at,
they're like old people look at their

299
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:55,820
phones like,
I don't even know how

300
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,810
this is the kind of lady that,
it's probably a three blackberries for

301
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,040
last 20 years.

302
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,300
Yeah.
I mean there's no way she didn't know,

303
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,870
but also not only that,
the guy who was in charge of her email

304
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:11,360
server was on reddit a couple of years
ago.

305
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,930
Yeah.
Ask him about

306
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,290
how'd I get rid of stuff for your or,

307
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,170
exactly.
We wanted to make everything disappear

308
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:21,420
and every lawyer who,
Huh?

309
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,050
Then I guess I guess it could be adding
that to what I was just asking.

310
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:27,230
Is there any way she didn't even know
what was going on or she had to,

311
00:14:27,231 --> 00:14:31,370
if there's no issue every way,
if someone was doing it thinking this is

312
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,550
what would be a great move,
I better just do this.

313
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:35,820
Oh,
I don't know.

314
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,430
I gave me a good raise or my kidney,
a good position later down the line and

315
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,390
found out like I took some initiative
here.

316
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:43,160
I,
I just went in and deleted them all.

317
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,630
You become as a new head of the NSA or
some shit?

318
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,501
No,
no.

319
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:49,780
I'm just curious.
Just,

320
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,130
I mean maybe,
I mean when a guy thinks

321
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,130
that she's gonna win and become the
president and he wants to Gig and I mean

322
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,270
all of those,
that's part of what we're sitting here

323
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:02,180
is like all these people,
we're all connected and sort of sort of

324
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:07,070
a weird,
like a sneaky fucking way where they do

325
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:09,920
a bunch of sneaky shit for each other
without even saying anything about it.

326
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:12,290
It's like,
like it's all like implied

327
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,970
and we all seen house of cards now too.
Like after saying that we definitely are

328
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:16,810
all like,
oh,

329
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,720
we think we get it because that seems so
true.

330
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,720
I bet that's going on,
right?

331
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,190
Yeah.
I mean that shit's crazy.

332
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,420
It's all real now.
The house,

333
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:29,960
the cards stuff's coming alive.
I know,

334
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:32,450
right,
because the storyline is crazier than

335
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:35,660
anything.
It's like it's like they realize that

336
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:39,980
veep and veep was winning Emmy's every
year and how's the cards started

337
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,600
changing the game of the mes because
that was the first thing from Netflix to

338
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:47,990
really start.
All of a sudden there was a new network

339
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,750
at the Emmys,
which was like an old,

340
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,080
I mean that's them crashing and old
party with just NBC and CBS and ABC and

341
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:57,530
then,
yeah.

342
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,110
Do you remember at the end of like
Bush's presidency that they were,

343
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,890
there was TV shows made about how goofy
he was as a president?

344
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,360
Yeah.
Comedy central head.

345
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,320
What was your old made a hole.
Yeah,

346
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,910
he was him for a thing.
Like how if somebody was Obama talking

347
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,820
about like how goofy Obama's presidency
now would that,

348
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,960
would that work?
Or like,

349
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:15,750
no,
it wouldn't worry.

350
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,980
Wouldn't even be the thing,
but if a trump presidency happened

351
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,170
again,
they could definitely make a whole new

352
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,900
nightly.
This is what trump did day.

353
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,840
Well,
snl,

354
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,870
they just announced they just signed to
Alec Baldwin to be trunk to be trump for

355
00:16:30,391 --> 00:16:33,090
the next year,
which is crazy.

356
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:39,090
Then the next year,
if they made it like a special deal that

357
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,810
they don't normally do,
they're paying him like a butt ton of

358
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:44,930
money to do this trump thing.

359
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,260
It's all very funny,
man.

360
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,010
It's all very funny.
It's just like,

361
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,220
it just proves my point that I've been
talking about for awhile that nobody who

362
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:58,110
smart wants that job.
I mean Hillary wants a job cause it's

363
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:02,400
like sort of the cap of this long career
and sort of,

364
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:03,780
um,
you know,

365
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:05,580
it's a historic moment.
If she wins,

366
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:09,030
she becomes the first female president.
But she's centered to criminal

367
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:12,390
investigations and they're also saying
that if she doesn't win,

368
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,740
it's very possible.
But the FBI might in tighter for a bunch

369
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:17,830
of shit.
There's the bank,

370
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,130
Ozzie stoked.
There's the email stuff.

371
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:22,680
There's,
there's a lot going on here.

372
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:26,160
It's just,
it's so disturbing that this is the best

373
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:28,970
we can do.
Him or her,

374
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,813
both of them.

375
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,230
I think trump is going to pull it out
because I think people are going to want

376
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,720
to shake this shit up.
I think that people talk a lot of smack

377
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:39,910
now and they want to seem like this and
that.

378
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:44,620
But I think when once they're in the
booth and it's just you and two boxes

379
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:47,530
and one says trump and the other says
Clinton and you think,

380
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:50,190
you know what?
Let's make these next four

381
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,940
years a little more interesting.
I think people are going to check it.

382
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:55,650
That's what they did with that brexit
thing.

383
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,330
No,
I don't.

384
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,910
I think brexit's a totally different
situation because brexit,

385
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,560
I have a friend,
my friend Steve Hilton,

386
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:05,640
remember Steve from the podcast.
Steve Hill was a very smart guy and used

387
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:08,790
to be um,
David Cameron's right hand man.

388
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,980
He's pro brexit.
He's like,

389
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:12,750
it's much more complicated than people
think.

390
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:16,680
He's like this idea that anyone from any
part of Europe can immigrate to the U K

391
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:18,570
is disastrous.
He goes,

392
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:20,330
it's not racist.
It's like the,

393
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,540
the UK has a lot to offer and if it does
in his mind,

394
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:28,500
it is my paraphrasing him,
but I believe what he's saying is that

395
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,100
if the UK does let everybody come in
from all over Europe and immigrated to

396
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:34,770
the UK,
that what's going to happen is there's

397
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:36,810
other parts of Europe does,
aren't doing so well.

398
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,280
Those people are going to go to the
place.

399
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,950
It's doing great and it's going to
fucking balance everything out

400
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,060
eventually.
But Europe is going to,

401
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,870
or UK rather,
it's going to suffer.

402
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,370
While while this is happening,
I don't know nearly enough to comment on

403
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:52,440
it,
but as a complicated issue,

404
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:54,960
but it's also one of those issues were
like super lefties,

405
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:57,870
really progressive liberal people
immediately want to say racist.

406
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,020
You don't want people to immigrate to
this country racist,

407
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,300
you know you don't want,
but that's what we're seeing here.

408
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,670
You can't just immigrate here from
Canada,

409
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:08,190
man.
If you want to just move from Canada to

410
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:10,050
the United States and we're start
working.

411
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,390
I've had a bunch of friends come over
here from Canada.

412
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:17,040
It's a long process management and easy
and that's like pretty white p from

413
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,290
Canada that look just like you,
you know,

414
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,120
we're all talking about like Mexicans
who look different or talking about

415
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:28,230
people who look like white European
people have an incredibly hard time

416
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,490
getting a green card.

417
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,600
A lot of them.
Mary,

418
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,160
my friend married some guy.
She married some guy just to that

419
00:19:34,161 --> 00:19:36,210
Canadians and yeah,
she was Canadian.

420
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,710
Wow.
Yeah,

421
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,450
I know another dude,
Matt.

422
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,150
Well,
she was rushing Russian factor to use

423
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,730
walker,
but he married her just so she could

424
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:46,350
become a citizen.
Hmm.

425
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,280
That's super common that you have to
like go through all these meetings,

426
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,590
have to make sure that you really are
husband and wife loans.

427
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,860
So your finger,
her show me.

428
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,100
You mean do you think if trump won,
he had actually built a wall?

429
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,070
I think if trump won,
he would hire a bunch of people to do

430
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:06,180
the job and they would start a new
reality TV show would like him on his

431
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:09,870
underwear,
his underwear on a yacht or fireside

432
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:12,750
chats live from the White House.
Probably something like that.

433
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:13,640
It'd be hosting,
you know,

434
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,483
you make do with what?

435
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,100
Donald Trump channel.
He figured out a way to make it a law.

436
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:22,130
So here's what's stunning to me is the
illusion that he's some good speaker.

437
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:27,990
His economy of words is terrible.
He makes a point that it repeats that

438
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:29,760
point and then he repeats that point
again.

439
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,960
Yes,
I said that.

440
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,670
Yes I did.
Yes,

441
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:35,670
I did like the Mexican wall thing.
Like when he said that,

442
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:39,150
I told them the wall just got 10 foot
higher.

443
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,000
Now,
if he was a real master speaker,

444
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,060
he would go from that right into
something else.

445
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:45,661
He goes,
yes,

446
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,410
I did.
That's what I like.

447
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,020
He,
he rambles on too much.

448
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:55,021
It's getting too much unprepared like
speeches like and that's what we saw in

449
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,750
a debate.
Like it's in contrast to her,

450
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,890
like she was very well prepared.
Like she,

451
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:04,090
she nailed a lot of like very important

452
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,090
points.
She set him up pretty good.

453
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:08,670
One strategy that I noticed that she
applied,

454
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:12,780
which I think was really smart,
was she kept her answers extremely

455
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:15,810
short,
extremely to the point.

456
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,080
She did not ramble at all because she
knew that he was going to do that and

457
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,770
she knew that he,
she could get him to make himself look

458
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:28,620
like a fool if she just plays it.
Absolutely cool.

459
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,120
Zero extra words because he does.
He overuses everything.

460
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:35,880
He repeats everything we're going to,
I said it once,

461
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:37,680
I'll say it again.
We're going to build a wall.

462
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,750
It's going to be great.
It's going to be a great wall.

463
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:42,120
It's going to be a great big wall.
People love it.

464
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,830
I love it.
You're going to love it.

465
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:45,480
America is going to love.
It's going to be great.

466
00:21:45,481 --> 00:21:46,730
We're going to make America great again.

467
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,940
One thing about me,
I have a winning temperament of winning

468
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,490
temperament.
Like that was so embarrassing,

469
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,330
really was.
There's certain points where he throws a

470
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:59,690
punch that misses so hard that you know,
it's like,

471
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,600
oh,
that's a huge dent.

472
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:04,340
He would,
he did it to himself.

473
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,750
What was that one moment where he said a
bunch of stupid shit in?

474
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:09,260
Then they went to her and she went,
well,

475
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,560
hi.
And she like laughed and smiled like she

476
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:14,800
handled that so smooth.
Yeah.

477
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,290
This is so embarrassing that first of
all,

478
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,020
why does an Al Gore run?
I don't understand that.

479
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,030
Yeah,
and they just became president.

480
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:24,350
Like,
why wouldn't you run again?

481
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,010
Like if he ran,
he would give the nomination like first.

482
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,330
And everybody fucking loves me because
trying to save the world,

483
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,730
right.
Wanted to be the president at one point

484
00:22:31,731 --> 00:22:34,010
in time.
Maybe it's just like too hard on you.

485
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,130
He was just too exhausting.
And maybe he,

486
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,410
maybe he just doesn't want it.

487
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,260
Maybe he knows how bad the whole thing
is.

488
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,930
Maybe knows something we don't know and
he probably does.

489
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,280
Also,
he has made a fuck ton of money since

490
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:53,260
he's been in white and the White House,
someone said that he is going to be the

491
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:58,261
first [inaudible] they call it cold.
I forget what they call it.

492
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:01,900
Green billionaire or they were,
they were talking climate change,

493
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:03,970
billionaire.
He's going to be the first climate

494
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:07,900
change advocate slash billionaire.
I apparently it's just made a ton of

495
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:12,640
money on speaking fees and all kinds of
other shit and he's just doing really

496
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,530
well telling everybody the sky is
falling.

497
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,350
He's come a long way since man,
their peg,

498
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,700
this man bear pig

499
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,190
and south park,
they had a couple of seasons where he

500
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:27,191
was chasing a man bear pig.
This is like their analogy to a global

501
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,364
warming.

502
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,590
13 it says,
isn't that worth,

503
00:23:30,591 --> 00:23:35,591
is gross more than $200 million since he
lost the presidential bid in 2000 so in

504
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:41,780
like 10 years or so,
gain $200 million being the president.

505
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,590
So much money and be in a pile.

506
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,850
What's the dig?
Lift up the whole storyline producers

507
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,320
like there's so much money and making a
failing product.

508
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,080
They tried to make a shake.
Maybe should he play?

509
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,290
What if now is it donald saw that he's
like,

510
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,160
I'll just do it.
Al Gore.

511
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:59,570
Did he get so close to winning?

512
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,240
Not when.
I don't think we would say that.

513
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,470
I was like,
it doesn't want to win.

514
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,910
He doesn't want to.
I think that people believe that.

515
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,460
I think they might be right.
I just don't think he expected to do

516
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:09,294
this.
Well.

517
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,220
I think he expected to get to a certain
point,

518
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:13,590
getting knocked down and just talk shit
about everybody who wins.

519
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,710
You know,
Talk Shit About Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz,

520
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,280
by the way.
I prefer Donald Trump.

521
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,660
Ted Cruz.
Yeah,

522
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,260
right.
That's,

523
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,290
it's really crazy.
Like Donald Trump is preferable.

524
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,960
Ted Cruz is fucking crazy.
Dan.

525
00:24:27,961 --> 00:24:28,980
Creepy.
Oh,

526
00:24:28,981 --> 00:24:31,800
it's a weird religious fucking fanatic
man.

527
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:34,620
He's a nutty guy.
It's got all sorts of problems with gay

528
00:24:34,621 --> 00:24:38,230
people and he suck.
He's sleepy.

529
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,150
He to me,
appeals to like the dumbest of like

530
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:46,770
religious ideologues,
like the dumbest of really fucking

531
00:24:46,771 --> 00:24:48,710
fanatical religious people.
Yeah,

532
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,033
Jeremy.
Yep.

533
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,280
And the way he like,
uh,

534
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,720
though it's,
you see when he kissed his daughter that

535
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:55,554
one time

536
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,840
video so gross where they show the
outtakes and the one where he punched an

537
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:02,490
elbowed his wife on stage right after he
locked,

538
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,420
clipped her right in the face,
act to just being a congressman right

539
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,850
now,
Senator Ted Turner.

540
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,480
Is that what he's back to doing now?
He just fist,

541
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,980
it's a good question.
Back into the life he had before.

542
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:14,690
Not Everybody knows all this weird shit
about them.

543
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,750
How's that work?
Yeah,

544
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,570
it has happened.
I guess it definitely happens.

545
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,430
Well,
what's weird is it that you could run

546
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:24,850
for president and keep that job if
that's the case,

547
00:25:24,851 --> 00:25:27,820
like how the fuck you don't have the
time to do your job right.

548
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,960
How can you just run for president and
also hold a job in public office?

549
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,530
And remember,
like they were saying Bernie was going

550
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:35,364
back,
he was,

551
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:41,070
he was taking hits on the campaign show
because he was going back for all those

552
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:44,700
things he had to do in Washington.
Like he would fly back every other day

553
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:47,970
or weekly if he had tiffany go for a
vote or something instead of campaigning

554
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:51,360
where Hillary would be off campaigning
cause she didn't have to be in those

555
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:52,230
votes.
And it's like,

556
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:54,390
well why isn't she doing her job,
the secretary to stay?

557
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,220
We're so lucky Bernie,
that nit Bernie got through all the

558
00:25:58,221 --> 00:26:01,010
hippies would be fucking,
there'd be going through the streets

559
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:02,000
screaming,
cheering.

560
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,270
Well I think it'd be,
I think it would be more one sided than

561
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:09,240
it is even though Hillary supposedly be
Bernie.

562
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,030
I think Bernie,
as weird as it is,

563
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:14,310
maybe I'm wrong,
but it seems like in the battle of

564
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:18,750
styles,
I think Bernie would be housing trump

565
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:19,471
right now.
Oh,

566
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:20,430
he would do.
He would do.

567
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,460
I think it'd be clearly like 80 2090 10
more in there than even this.

568
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,331
You know,
whatever.

569
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:28,164
It seems to be

570
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,890
just one of the most disturbing things
about all this stuff is the Democratic

571
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,100
National Committee,
the DNC leaks that show that they were

572
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:41,101
conspiring.
It's Bernie Sanders is really bad cause

573
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:41,771
you,
you're,

574
00:26:41,771 --> 00:26:43,740
you're literally rigging democracy.

575
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,270
Like your party is supposed to be the
Democratic Party,

576
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,340
right?
I mean you're supposed to like try to

577
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:52,110
find,
let's find the best representative.

578
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,420
What do the people want?
Like you guys are reading it.

579
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,150
Yeah.
You read a vrf existence,

580
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,380
defend what they did,
but I think uh,

581
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,980
one might say did what they did.
I think this is just a thought.

582
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:09,240
They were trying to stop someone who
wasn't a Democrat from just coming in

583
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,480
and taking over their party because he's
not a Democrat as far as I've heard.

584
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:13,690
He's just an independent,
right.

585
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,920
Which is why he's can't take over now if
she would've got sick.

586
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:21,210
So like there are preventing some wild
card like Donald Trump,

587
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,120
I guess some guys just became super
famous and just being like,

588
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,740
ah,
I'm going to fucking ruin everything you

589
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:27,300
guys been playing on for the last 10
years.

590
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,210
How does that work?
He's not,

591
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,980
is he does,
he couldn't he just go back and forth

592
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:33,670
from being a Democrat or an independent.
Right,

593
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:33,870
right.

594
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,820
See I thought he was a Democrat when she
was super

595
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,700
hot coffee.
People that actually know about politics

596
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,660
right now.
You fucking

597
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,730
moron.
I think Bernie had a lot of positive

598
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:48,620
qualities.
Yeah.

599
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,540
There's first of all,
when he was in that debate with Hillary

600
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,130
and he was talking about,
Oh you know,

601
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:55,740
why won't she release the transcripts
for most speeches?

602
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,020
And he goes,
you can read my transcripts cause they

603
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:01,050
don't exist.
So that I would not accept money from

604
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,200
banks or,
yeah,

605
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,240
it was,
it was interesting.

606
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,980
He's just,
he,

607
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,300
he,
I think he's,

608
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,860
what he's done is let people know that
there's a market for that.

609
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,400
There's a market for the outsider that,
you know,

610
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,000
lives a frugal life and does it really
make a ton of money.

611
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,540
But his one,
if anybody has ever been running for

612
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:26,541
president and represents the average
person and I'm really ethical,

613
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,920
average person,
it's Bernie,

614
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:34,250
but a lot of peoples on the other side,
a lot of people think that this whole

615
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:38,400
democratic socialists thing,
it sort of supports people don't have a

616
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:42,360
good work ethic and supports people who
are lazy sports people want government

617
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:45,240
handouts and what he's trying to do
with,

618
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,150
you know,
jacking up taxes and some of the crazy

619
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:50,790
shit that he said.
It's just like take from the poor,

620
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:55,440
the rich and give to the poor and he's
is a big part of his platform was wealth

621
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:58,440
inequality,
which is a big issue with a lot of

622
00:28:58,441 --> 00:28:59,670
people.
It's understandable.

623
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:04,020
It makes sense,
but I don't think anybody has solved the

624
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:06,420
riddle of how to overcome wealth
inequality.

625
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:06,510
Yeah.

626
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,270
Sweden seems to have a real knack for
it.

627
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:10,980
Free hospitals,
free college,

628
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:13,260
and we were there.
The streets were beautiful.

629
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,500
Everything's clean,
free public transportation,

630
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,020
Free Hospital,
street college was the other thing.

631
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,220
Something else.
Well,

632
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:23,010
those things were already much,
everything's free and they pay,

633
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,490
what was it?
I think 30 or 40% tax.

634
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:31,491
I don't know the exact I at all numbers,
but they pay a very high sales tax on

635
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,070
everything.
You pay it on everything.

636
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:38,040
New pair of shoes.
Fuck you pay me a new tee shirt.

637
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,060
Fuck you.
Pay me

638
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,370
Sweden.
It's a beautiful

639
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:46,550
2015,
10 that's an a world superpower.

640
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,760
That's an army that can take police and
even edit your time.

641
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,910
That's a good point.
The number of people is a good point

642
00:29:52,911 --> 00:29:55,640
too.
Like when you get to like 300 million

643
00:29:55,641 --> 00:29:59,300
people and you start talking about like
universal basic income,

644
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,120
you know,
which is an interesting conversation

645
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:03,980
that keeps getting brought up.
Uh,

646
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,821
you know,
uh,

647
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:07,130
that was what Eddie Wong brought up on
the podcast.

648
00:30:07,131 --> 00:30:08,610
We started talking about it.
That's not,

649
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,850
it was crazy initially.
But then I've read some of the things

650
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:15,440
that some economists have said and some,
some people believe that if you just

651
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,820
gave people certain amount of money
where there's $12,000 a year more or

652
00:30:19,821 --> 00:30:23,090
whatever it is,
that it would alleviate the stress of

653
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:26,030
paying bills.
People would have like a certain amount

654
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:28,520
of income.
And it would be far less crime and then

655
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:31,790
the government would need to spend far
less money because it'd be far less

656
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:33,890
issues,
which I think is fascinating.

657
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,990
I don't know if it's true.
I don't know if it's right,

658
00:30:35,991 --> 00:30:37,480
but I like,
yeah,

659
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:41,600
it's very out of the box and when a
country's is fucked up as we are,

660
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,130
we have these ghettos like a with
Michael Wood was talking about with

661
00:30:46,131 --> 00:30:49,430
Baltimore where there just is systemic
racism,

662
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,940
systemic ghettos where they've like made
it so like black people cannot buy

663
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:57,500
houses any place other than these areas
and that these areas outside of that are

664
00:30:57,501 --> 00:30:59,690
only for white people.
Like when you have like something like

665
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,900
that that existed until like,
I think you said the 1960s is when those

666
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:04,730
laws were still in at,
in in effect,

667
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,230
right.
I think,

668
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,530
I don't know at least that I would say
at least that.

669
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,390
So that's my lifetime.
I was born in 67 so during my lifetime

670
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,320
these laws were being enforced,
which is just fucking crazy.

671
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:21,170
Like you,
when you have a system that's that nuts,

672
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,200
like you got to,
you got to have a radical plan to fix

673
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:24,290
it.

674
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,220
So there was a neighborhood outside of
Baltimore that was only white people.

675
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,470
You could not buy a house there if
you're black,

676
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,100
we would not sell.
You have a d at the address to this.

677
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,160
How dare you.
I thought you were in a fucking black

678
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,330
girls man.
Isn't that a new thing?

679
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,710
Just kidding guys.
Just kidding.

680
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,823
Hey,
your new thing.

681
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,120
Uh,
I think black girls do have a warmer

682
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:46,490
vagina than white girls.
How much warmer?

683
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,610
I think just a few degrees warmer.
Like if you took a white vagina and put

684
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:51,320
it in the microwave for like five
seconds.

685
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,750
And how many black girls have you had
sex with?

686
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,200
I noticed there was only only two and it
was a one summer about three years ago.

687
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,090
And,
but I noticed it with both of them and

688
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,730
it wasn't even at the same time.
It was just the same summer.

689
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,180
I was no setting for my friend in the
Hollywood hills and they'd be,

690
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:15,110
it just felt warm or cause you were so
excited to be bringing a black chick

691
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,490
that your dick was going.
Woo pretty much was either that or they

692
00:32:19,491 --> 00:32:24,491
had fevers and they just,
every second these girls with malaria,

693
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,510
they coughing a lot and then they were
when mine.

694
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,543
All right.

695
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,440
It's so silly.
You,

696
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,170
have you ever been,
have you,

697
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:43,970
did you ever hook up with a black woman?
Oh yeah.

698
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,760
Did you ever notice anything different
with their darker than me?

699
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,500
I noticed that

700
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,460
one time when I lived in Boston,
you know,

701
00:32:56,461 --> 00:32:58,290
it was like the winter I was,
it's really,

702
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,510
you know,
pales like this,

703
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,150
like cloudy and I was Pale,
you know,

704
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:06,210
I didn't have very much a time to go out
in the sun.

705
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,640
And A,
I hooked up with this black girl I met

706
00:33:08,641 --> 00:33:10,200
in Pittsfield,
Massachusetts.

707
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,850
Wow.
Which is way out in the middle of

708
00:33:11,851 --> 00:33:13,950
nowhere.
And she wasn't black like beyond,

709
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:16,560
say black.
She was black like check Congo,

710
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,990
black,
dark,

711
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,190
whoa,
dark.

712
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:25,170
And we had sex in my hotel room by the
light of the television,

713
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,900
right.
So the TV's on and I'm having sex with

714
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:31,650
her and she's dark light Cole and I'm
white paper.

715
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,700
We're going at it.
And I remember thinking about it cause

716
00:33:35,701 --> 00:33:37,140
we were doing it doggy style.
I remember,

717
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,330
look down at it,
she had an incredible body.

718
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:40,800
All my God,
this girl,

719
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:42,600
to this day,
it's like one of the best bodies I've

720
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:43,434
ever seen in my life.

721
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,990
It was like cartoonish or body was
incredible.

722
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,790
But I remember to this day thinking
like,

723
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,770
wow,
this is so crazy.

724
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,300
They're like,
we'll like,

725
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:54,900
she's so much darker than me.
I'm so white and I'm not even that

726
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:55,920
white.
I'm Italian,

727
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,210
you know?
Mostly.

728
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:01,050
But I mean it just,
the contrast was so interesting.

729
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,890
But the girls that I have had sex with,
it just,

730
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,920
maybe it's a coincidence,
maybe sound,

731
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,680
but all the black shirts that had sex
with,

732
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:11,160
we're fucking freaks.
Like they were so much more

733
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:12,450
enthusiastic.
Yeah.

734
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,290
So much more vocal,
so much more aggressive.

735
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,030
You know,
like Kenya,

736
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,570
come on,
Oh,

737
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,970
oh,
hold that good tech.

738
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,350
Like whoa.
Jesus.

739
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,570
Plus,
while it's happening,

740
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,820
you know,
as a comic hall,

741
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:29,820
stuff like that's happening.
Like,

742
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,140
oh my God,
I remember this one.

743
00:34:31,141 --> 00:34:32,320
If it's a bit near,
yeah,

744
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,560
just take it.
No,

745
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,720
I could never make a bit out of it
though because it seems so phrases.

746
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,700
Yeah.
Just even say how dark she was and how

747
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,020
wide I was.
It was like,

748
00:34:40,021 --> 00:34:43,980
how do I say this without sounding,
I mean it's just,

749
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:47,640
it's such a racially charged thing.
Like even if you're,

750
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:52,641
if it's not the jokes not racist or the
discussion of the subject is not racist.

751
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,500
It's so racially charged,
you're better off just leaving it alone.

752
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,690
Plus,
one of the things I've noticed,

753
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:01,100
um,
I had a conversation with this girl that

754
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,450
I was dating at the time.
Um,

755
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,700
and uh,
she did like,

756
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:07,110
you know,
it was one of those years have sex with

757
00:35:07,111 --> 00:35:08,600
blog.
Yeah.

758
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,010
Yeah.
Maybe you're having sex with a black

759
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:11,671
girl.
Yeah.

760
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:12,580
A couple.
How many,

761
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,040
you know,
those kinds of conversations.

762
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,230
But I was telling her how dark this girl
was.

763
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:19,890
Like she was getting upset
so she was dark.

764
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,630
But I mean it's like if I asked her,
you know like how bill,

765
00:35:24,631 --> 00:35:25,680
how black ones,
this guy,

766
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,420
you know like how blog [inaudible] blog,
you know like Congo black like dropped

767
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,410
out of the jungle.

768
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,610
Boy,
what are we talking here?

769
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,620
He had the skin of a good year tire.
No,

770
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,483
no,
no,

771
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,200
nope.
I heard drummed

772
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,570
is for whatever it is.
Got.

773
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,960
She got upset that I was,
I,

774
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,500
I'd fucked this bar girl in the past.
Like is the shade that offended or the

775
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:53,190
most though she's racist.
She's from Staten Island town.

776
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,650
That'll do it.
Tiny girl from standing out.

777
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,520
Racist.
Oof.

778
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,160
Two more now.
Park row

779
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,240
one day.
But here's the thing,

780
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,370
here's what's fucked.
You know,

781
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:10,380
like someone said to me once,
one day everyone's going to be like mix

782
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,560
because like right now the only reason
why race existed in such specific like

783
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:21,090
distinctive ways like Chinese people,
African people,

784
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:26,091
like really distinctive differences is
because those people very rarely met

785
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:29,850
each other.
But now everybody goes everywhere.

786
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:33,390
And a place like the United States,
which is essentially just a melting pot

787
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,390
of immigrants,
does own the only people that were here

788
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:41,310
originally where the indigenous people,
but even the indigenous people came over

789
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:43,770
from Asia,
they all came on the bering strait.

790
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,730
I mean all the people that live here
that we think of as native Americans,

791
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,120
they've done like these DNA tests on
them will think if they come from

792
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:53,190
fucking Siberia.
You know,

793
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:54,690
you know,
it's really funny now,

794
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,720
who did the DNA test to find that out?
So really rich dude who was a mormon who

795
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,520
wanted approve.
One of,

796
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:06,060
uh,
Joseph Smith's statements was that the

797
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:09,450
American Indians were in fact the lost
tribe of Israel.

798
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,310
And he thought that he could prove that
and prove that the,

799
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:16,680
the,
the Mormon doctrine that the book of

800
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:20,460
Mormon was correct.
And so he spent all this money to get

801
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:23,160
the DNA test done,
turned out there from fucking Siberia

802
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,200
because the kids are not high.
Oops.

803
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,930
Did he tried to,
well,

804
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:30,360
I don't think you can.
I don't think scientists let you hide

805
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:34,590
the data and to get it done.
Maybe some extra money to get it fucked

806
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:35,370
up.

807
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,520
A real lab that's doing those kinds of
DNA test.

808
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:42,090
I would imagine that would be like an
important finding and they would want to

809
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:43,420
release it.
I would again,

810
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:48,490
oh yes.
Scientists could cover up data then we

811
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:53,511
wouldn't know that mushrooms can care.
Chronic depression from the studies.

812
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:57,420
That was a Carnegie Parkins John Hopkins
University.

813
00:37:57,421 --> 00:38:00,360
This has been a few studies now are
showing that.

814
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,460
Yeah,
I no man,

815
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,940
it's um,
it's everybody has come.

816
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:09,000
What I was going to say is everybody has
come to the United States from somewhere

817
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:09,834
else.
Right.

818
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,560
And then one day conceivably that people
keep fucking,

819
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,840
that we're all going to be like one kind
of thing,

820
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,080
one shade.
We're all be like this sort of Tan that,

821
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,630
but the problem with that is it's kind
of cool.

822
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,930
You know,
what do you walk down the street and you

823
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:29,520
see this dude who's black flag coal and
it's got a little Chinese girlfriend and

824
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:30,960
like,
whoa boy,

825
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,790
I want to watch this to do it.

826
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,740
It's kind of exciting.
I mean,

827
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:37,930
it's kind of fun that people are
different,

828
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,930
but we can handle that fun.
Some people can't handle it right.

829
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,630
Without being racist.
And not only that,

830
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:47,560
because of racists,
we can't make racial jokes.

831
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,920
Like if you can't even talk about like
pretty obvious differences in the races

832
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:58,300
without being labeled a racist,
like things that are really just so

833
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:01,000
obvious and less.
You're making fun of white people.

834
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,790
You can make fun of white people till
the cows come home.

835
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,860
Nobody gives a shit because why?
People are,

836
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:08,620
the majority white people were thought
of as the oppressors.

837
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,660
White people owned slaves,
you know,

838
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:11,590
et Cetera,
et cetera.

839
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,780
So you can shit on white people all day
long.

840
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:16,300
Nobody ever gives you a hard time for
shitting on white people.

841
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,273
Yeah,

842
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,190
yeah.
They're the,

843
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:20,080
the,
it's,

844
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:22,270
it's in,
it's no fun to make fun of white people

845
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:23,290
either.
That's,

846
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,790
you know,
it's just sorta like,

847
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,240
you know,

848
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,190
well,
it's always no fun to make fun of

849
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:30,620
someone who,
well,

850
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,010
when someone is in charge or someone is
on the,

851
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,401
uh,
oh,

852
00:39:34,401 --> 00:39:35,730
someone has power,
right.

853
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,820
Those are the people you're supposed to
just fuck with.

854
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,160
Cause it's useful to punch up.
Right.

855
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,720
You should always punch up and comedy
Tony.

856
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,060
Yeah.
You should always punch up,

857
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,490
which is not necessarily true because
sometimes the people like my purse,

858
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,950
my classic example of why punching up as
an,

859
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,580
it's funny as the sand Kansas bit about
starving people in Africa and one of the

860
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:58,670
greatest bits of all time and it's
literally talking about starving

861
00:39:58,671 --> 00:40:00,500
children.
It's fucking hilarious.

862
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:04,910
But you know,
I think that like when,

863
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,430
when someone is in a position of power
though,

864
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:12,610
it's open season on them as opposed to
someone who comes from a marginalized

865
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:13,760
group.
Like what?

866
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,600
Even if it's something funny or if
something from a marginalized group and

867
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:19,940
it's a really funny thing.
If you talk about it,

868
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:22,170
you can get in trouble.
Yeah.

869
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,540
Do you,
uh,

870
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,620
have you ever gotten in trouble for
anything racial and like,

871
00:40:28,621 --> 00:40:29,910
I mean,
doing the stand up,

872
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,930
like did you ever cross the line or
crowd wise or anything?

873
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,100
No.
No.

874
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:38,910
I never got in trouble,
but I've never,

875
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:42,840
I've never been like a a racial comic.
Right.

876
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,090
That's not really my thing.
You know,

877
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,350
like Russell,
like we were talking about the other

878
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,220
day,
like Russell Peters,

879
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,390
Russel's half his act is about race,
but he can get away with it because he's

880
00:40:51,391 --> 00:40:54,000
Indian.
Cause he's brown because he's Indian.

881
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,080
She's the,

882
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,270
the chosen one.
He's a brown guy from Canada that

883
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,550
America,
like he's got it all.

884
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,010
Yeah.
He can make fun of everything and be

885
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:04,310
like,
yeah,

886
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,950
what do you want?
Tom Brown,

887
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,110
Brown from Asia just got the whole thing
wrapped up.

888
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,150
Yeah.
It's got this thing on lock.

889
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,453
Yeah.
I mean,

890
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,160
right.
India,

891
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,993
Asia,
right.

892
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,260
Hmm.
Yeah.

893
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,370
I had to ask.
I was sure what I said.

894
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,460
Then after I said it was okay.
It was like,

895
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,160
yeah,
right.

896
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,993
Yeah.
Right.

897
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:22,863
Yeah.
Right.

898
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,580
Okay.
But so was Russia,

899
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,080
right?
That's what's weird.

900
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,490
That's just,
yeah.

901
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,770
Wow.
Russia is part of Asia.

902
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,910
Wow.
Yeah.

903
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,740
It's just the most people that live in
Russia don't all live in the Asian part.

904
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,000
Yeah.
Live in the European.

905
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:35,400
Yeah.

906
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,110
It's like Egypt,
Egypt,

907
00:41:37,111 --> 00:41:40,590
Africa.
Everybody thinks of Egypt as the Middle

908
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,430
East.
Well,

909
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:43,230
it Kinda is,
but it's also Africa.

910
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:44,730
Yeah.

911
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,440
Yeah.
My mind is blown right now.

912
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,930
Egypt is a part of Africa,
you know it's fucked up.

913
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,130
When I went to Italy,
Egypt like right there,

914
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,650
like you're fucking swim to it.
Not really,

915
00:41:55,651 --> 00:41:59,010
but I mean the d,
the distance between Egypt and Italy is

916
00:41:59,011 --> 00:41:59,880
like,
it's fucking hop,

917
00:41:59,881 --> 00:42:03,270
skip and a jump.
How it's how the Moore's invaded Sicily.

918
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,670
They were right there.
They got of raft,

919
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,830
they went over and a raft.
He just raped everybody.

920
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,710
It's real close

921
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,720
man.
And that's how people started getting

922
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:19,721
browner Italians if every race or aren't
did the differences in race in some

923
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:25,180
situations based off of geography.
Sure.

924
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,040
Yeah.
So that's why I was just kind of think

925
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,230
that,
I was thinking that thought too,

926
00:42:29,231 --> 00:42:30,920
that everyone will end up looking the
same color,

927
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:32,690
but that's a fairly well live in the
same place.

928
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:34,610
Right?
That's the sort of people live there.

929
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:35,910
They declared that ended up being
darker.

930
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,730
They'll be well live further away from
it.

931
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,970
That's good point.
But how come everybody in Arizona so

932
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:42,560
fucking white in there and stay inside
away from the sun?

933
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,960
He punched Chicago cargo or dark.

934
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,743
Wow.

935
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,990
See what I'm saying,
it's no reflection and go to the south

936
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:51,500
side of Chicago and then go to
Scottsdale and you go like,

937
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:56,501
what the fuck is going on here?
I mean the origins of those people.

938
00:42:58,071 --> 00:42:58,850
Yeah,
for sure.

939
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:02,030
If you lived in a continent like Africa
where the sun's beating down on you all

940
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:03,800
the time,
you need more Melanin to protect you

941
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:05,900
from the sun.
If you lived in a place,

942
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:07,250
it's always like,
you know,

943
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:11,120
Norway or something like that where it's
very little sun nor we have very little

944
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,700
sun I would imagine.
Right.

945
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,710
I slammed all fucking white people.

946
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,020
Uh,
we were talking and I forget someone was

947
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:25,040
on the podcast this week and the Tower
of Babel came up in giants in new West.

948
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:25,970
Yes,
it was.

949
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,730
I wrote something down when I came up to
Santa thought that,

950
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,260
and I'm not sure I could've looked it
up.

951
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:31,850
I guess that,
uh,

952
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,850
I wrote down like Internet and English
could be,

953
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,500
that was my phone.
Could be that,

954
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:39,630
uh,
uh,

955
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,050
that time Babel sing senior language.
And I guess what I mean when Internet

956
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:48,051
English is that like aren't most
websites coded and English because of

957
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:54,830
the Internet started and like over here
the West where people all speak English

958
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:56,760
to me like html.
Yeah.

959
00:43:56,761 --> 00:43:59,820
Like wouldn't,
a Chinese website has to be coded in

960
00:43:59,821 --> 00:44:04,080
html and they could have some program
that's translating their stuff that's

961
00:44:04,081 --> 00:44:05,530
easier for them to do it.
Hmm.

962
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,820
Was getting into my head like that's
almost in some way like 15 or 30 years

963
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,380
that most of the Internet,
which is a worldwide will all be

964
00:44:13,381 --> 00:44:15,840
communicating and us with a similar
language.

965
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,060
I said that to my friend.
That's kind of why I brought it up and

966
00:44:18,061 --> 00:44:22,100
he asked if I ever heard of Esperanto.
You ever heard of this language called s

967
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:22,820
upper antone?

968
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,720
Yeah,
I have,

969
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,280
but I don't remember.
It helped

970
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:30,300
in 1887 by some guy that was literally
trying to create one language and it's,

971
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:31,980
if

972
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,790
you look it up now and you can find out
that it's not dead and there's the more,

973
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:40,740
the fastest growing languages apparently
for people learning to speak something

974
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:41,574
different.
Right.

975
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,340
Never fucking heard of it though before
this week.

976
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,470
Oh,
I mean it's one of the fastest growing

977
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:48,810
languages.
It's like what else is out there?

978
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,840
Like I know there's no really gross like
English,

979
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:53,670
Spanish,
Chinese.

980
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:57,930
That's broad.
That's right below Russian is weird.

981
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:02,950
And then I'm going to stop and learn,
start to learn Russian or a sephardic or

982
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,140
weird language.
I just learned,

983
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,920
I just slammed how to speak times new
Roman.

984
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,280
Anyway,
a

985
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,260
style,
you know what I mean?

986
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:19,350
Been into lately is uh,
did you watch narcos?

987
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,840
Yes.
Well I went,

988
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:27,140
started doing more research after that
cause I was like Jonesing for more

989
00:45:27,511 --> 00:45:31,220
narcos and they're done for now.
No season two did you go to high?

990
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,800
Just watched all the seasons.
Four episodes.

991
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,130
It God,
is it good?

992
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,600
And it leaves you just wanting so much
more in the end and it's great.

993
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:42,630
It's great in a good way.
It leaves you wanting more.

994
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,630
And uh,
so I started watching more and more

995
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:49,110
documentaries and holy shit.
What,

996
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,380
what is going well,
what goes on down there might be one of

997
00:45:52,381 --> 00:45:54,450
the most amazing things in all of the
world.

998
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,430
Which ones you want,
uh,

999
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,030
that something temporary.
Most likely it's in,

1000
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,040
it's got a Spanish title and it's in
Spanish with English subtitles and it's

1001
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:09,690
got all the videos and all the pictures
of Pablo Escobar.

1002
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,670
All of it.
Like all of it.

1003
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:13,680
Videos of him getting dragged off the
roof

1004
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,070
had the,
the,

1005
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,490
when he's young,
when he's spoiler alert,

1006
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,090
a lot of people don't know he's dead.
Tony,

1007
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,700
everybody that's like Hitler.
Spoiler alert.

1008
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:28,091
Well,
it's funny.

1009
00:46:28,091 --> 00:46:30,540
It's funny you mentioned that because I
started a documentary,

1010
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,390
uh,
yesterday about how on Netflix about how

1011
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:37,230
or might still be alive and living in
the Andes and it was the dumbest

1012
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:40,080
documentary.
I W I so badly wanted it to get my

1013
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:41,700
attention at all.
And it was just,

1014
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,730
it had nothing half an hour in.
I had to shut it off.

1015
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,460
Wasn't there a history channel show
called fighting Hitler?

1016
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,680
Well,
they go searching for Hitler because I

1017
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,840
thought that maybe Hitler escaped to
South America.

1018
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,340
Wouldn't that be great?
He's in Argentina.

1019
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:57,560
Well,
you know,

1020
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,930
that was where a lot of Nazis went.
Yeah.

1021
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:03,150
A lot of Nazis escape Germany and went
to South America.

1022
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,740
Wouldn't it be great if people that went
out looking for Hitler ended up finding

1023
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:12,090
big foot and the people,
the people that went out looking for

1024
00:47:12,091 --> 00:47:14,970
bigfoot,
like I'm forest and just Hitler walks by

1025
00:47:14,971 --> 00:47:19,140
and like go about your business.
They found bones,

1026
00:47:19,141 --> 00:47:24,141
a little mustache or
my friend Adam Green tree who's on the

1027
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,150
other day was telling me about
aborigines.

1028
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:29,820
He came over my house last night.
We had dinner and he would

1029
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,460
some stuff that I really wished he
brought up on the podcast because it's

1030
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:37,270
fucking crazy to Abbott or aborigines,
not in Australia.

1031
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,720
Not only do they not have like a re,
most of them don't have a written

1032
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:43,120
language,
but they could live.

1033
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:47,590
Someone could live here and then you
could live 10 miles away and it'd be a

1034
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:52,591
totally different language and they call
their tribes mobs.

1035
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,270
They called it,
they call my mob.

1036
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,090
That's like,
so you have one mob and then you have

1037
00:47:58,091 --> 00:48:02,140
another mob that's like 1520 kilometers
away.

1038
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,210
The totally different language.
And I go,

1039
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:06,880
how many of them are there?
Like how many different languages?

1040
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:08,830
He's like,
Oh fuck thousands.

1041
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,200
I was like thousands.
And he was like,

1042
00:48:11,201 --> 00:48:12,850
not only that,
when they die,

1043
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,490
like nobody knows that language.
Nobody knows their history,

1044
00:48:15,491 --> 00:48:17,800
it's all gone.
And there was this one cave,

1045
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,140
like literally a fucking cave for these
people were living in.

1046
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,220
And they were apparently when,
you know,

1047
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,950
they settled this area,
like the aborigines obviously were there

1048
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:29,080
first.
And then when the white people came and

1049
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:31,960
settled,
when they raising cattle,

1050
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:34,750
the aborigines were stealing the cattle
to them.

1051
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,240
They didn't think of it as stealing.
They thought it was a ho,

1052
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:38,230
hey,
here's some food,

1053
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:41,440
I'm gonna eat it.
And so they ate the cows and the

1054
00:48:41,441 --> 00:48:44,720
ranchers got pissed.
So they brought them food and poison

1055
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:48,280
them.
And there's this cave that he found that

1056
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:50,890
he took all these photographs.
Adam did office site,

1057
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,180
you probably find it.
I'm on Adam Green trees of photography

1058
00:48:55,181 --> 00:49:00,181
page and yeah,
and it is filled with bones to bones of

1059
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:04,930
these 30 people that live there were
part of this mob cause they're,

1060
00:49:04,931 --> 00:49:08,320
they live in these really small tribes
and they poisoned them.

1061
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:09,870
So they brought them food and they put
it,

1062
00:49:09,871 --> 00:49:11,560
he said,
we found like babies,

1063
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:15,610
little tiny ribs,
like a little three inch long ribs from

1064
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:18,970
a baby that got poisoned and he's like
the entire tribe.

1065
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:22,720
She's dead and their bones,
which is there just laying inside this

1066
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:25,570
cave and he's got photographs with this
cave.

1067
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:27,490
It's really crazy.
Like he'd go inside the caves,

1068
00:49:27,491 --> 00:49:31,660
all this weird art work of all these
weird animals,

1069
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,680
including some animals that like doesn't
even exist anymore like dead

1070
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,330
brontosaurus who's depicted on the wall
like with the long neck or [inaudible]

1071
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:43,570
or something like that.
But the idea that these people live

1072
00:49:43,571 --> 00:49:46,990
there for so long and had all these
different dialects,

1073
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:51,940
they're like someone 20 miles away would
speak way different than people here and

1074
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,760
none of it was written down.
Now their history was written down.

1075
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:58,780
Like all of it was just like stories
that they told over the campfire or

1076
00:49:58,781 --> 00:49:59,614
whatever.

1077
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,940
I thought you were going to go into the
uh,

1078
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,690
big foot Australia thing.
I was in that.

1079
00:50:03,691 --> 00:50:07,110
Do they have it?
Did they talk about it there or if you

1080
00:50:07,111 --> 00:50:09,240
watched finding big foot,
they say they have one.

1081
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:10,920
Okay.
What did he do?

1082
00:50:10,921 --> 00:50:11,670
Get on?
Uh,

1083
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,740
get on a ship.
I grew up there.

1084
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,110
He grew up in Australia.
They have their own,

1085
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,460
they have their own portals or
something.

1086
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,130
Well,

1087
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,570
there's um,
an animal in,

1088
00:50:20,571 --> 00:50:22,370
I think it's Vietnam.
They called the Orang.

1089
00:50:22,371 --> 00:50:25,190
Pendek.
I think that's what from Vietnam for

1090
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:28,190
somewhere around maybe somewhere else.
Maybe it's an amnesia,

1091
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,620
but uh,
the Orang pendek was like a,

1092
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,980
as like a small hairy monkey man that's
like,

1093
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,930
but I think it's a little,
I think it's the only like four feet

1094
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:38,660
tall or something like that.
And they think that that thing,

1095
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,980
at least the legend of that thing is
probably similar to that.

1096
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:43,880
Hobbit,
man,

1097
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:48,690
Homo flory is four.
He assists four yeses.

1098
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,720
I think that's what you're saying.
I think that's it.

1099
00:50:50,721 --> 00:50:53,390
It's from the island of Flores.
They found these a hobbit.

1100
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:57,950
People legitimately were a different
species of human,

1101
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:02,930
like this really weird look in three
foot tall little hobbit person.

1102
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,190
Creepy.
Oh yeah.

1103
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,100
And they existed fairly recently.
Like,

1104
00:51:08,101 --> 00:51:11,850
I think they found bones that were as
recent as 14,000 years ago.

1105
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:13,530
Geez.
Yeah.

1106
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:16,170
So 14,000 years ago,
there's a little hobbit.

1107
00:51:16,171 --> 00:51:19,470
People were running around.
Not only that,

1108
00:51:19,471 --> 00:51:22,230
they think that they had like real
problems with people at the interact

1109
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:23,370
with each other,
fight with each other,

1110
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,230
maybe prayed on each other.

1111
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,120
Yeah.
Well not like hobbits or they liked the

1112
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,610
hobbits,
hobbits,

1113
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:35,670
Lord of the rings.
There were like three magical people or

1114
00:51:35,671 --> 00:51:36,504
something.
Kind of,

1115
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,210
no,
no,

1116
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:40,110
no.
I don't think that they were respected.

1117
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:40,980
Right.
Yeah,

1118
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:41,814
they did.

1119
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,050
Did some street cred.

1120
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:48,730
Yeah.
I mean they were cool.

1121
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:50,630
Yeah.
Maybe they got fucked with because they

1122
00:51:50,631 --> 00:51:53,050
were a little right.
And it's just trying to remember,

1123
00:51:53,051 --> 00:51:53,884
cause I feel ah,

1124
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,640
they didn't wear shoes.
Did that they were like hairy feet

1125
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:57,930
number.
Big Hairy feet.

1126
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,610
That's a little creepy.

1127
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:01,180
Okay.

1128
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,330
Yeah.
Potentially.

1129
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,510
You know,
when Dominic Monaghan was on a podcast,

1130
00:52:04,511 --> 00:52:06,490
I literally almost forgot that he was a
hobbit.

1131
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,361
You know,
cause I,

1132
00:52:08,361 --> 00:52:10,570
I thought of him as the guy from Los
Charlie.

1133
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:14,500
Charlie from loss or drowned.
Yeah.

1134
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,150
So sad.
Yeah.

1135
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,103
He said,
Charlie,

1136
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,190
he's back.
He's alive.

1137
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:19,180
We were,
um,

1138
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,730
yeah,
he's great.

1139
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,440
So yes,
I been getting more into these,

1140
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:28,010
uh,
Pablo Escobar documentaries just live in

1141
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,080
that kind of lifestyle,
you know what I mean?

1142
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:33,140
Just live in that life for him.
Smoking joints,

1143
00:52:33,141 --> 00:52:36,140
watch and Pablo Escobar,
smoking joints.

1144
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:39,200
Yeah.
I liked what he wore were like grandpa

1145
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:40,610
sweaters and shit.
Yeah,

1146
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,680
he went to worst clothes.
Yeah.

1147
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,090
He had like bad running shoes.
Pretty sure the Cardigan.

1148
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,090
I warned my special,
he's one at some point and

1149
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,910
I was just hearing that some people
think that uh,

1150
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:57,970
El Chapo might have more money and more,
uh,

1151
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:03,350
reach then Escobar did,
but not more power or at least not more

1152
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:05,510
power within the countries.
Right.

1153
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:06,900
Well,
definitely not now.

1154
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,340
Yeah,
it's definitely different time period

1155
00:53:08,341 --> 00:53:09,880
too,
but he's fucked now.

1156
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,110
He broke his leg trying to get away.
Jumped you there.

1157
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:15,840
I think the reason it got brought up was
because this lawyer is currently

1158
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:19,680
complaining that he's being tortured in
prison and how's it being tortured?

1159
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,410
He was in prison for a long time before
though.

1160
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:24,150
Right.
He's in prison for a long time.

1161
00:53:24,151 --> 00:53:26,430
Then he escaped and then they got them
again.

1162
00:53:26,431 --> 00:53:28,710
They just keep again,
skip four times.

1163
00:53:28,711 --> 00:53:31,650
I think
he's a freak.

1164
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,650
He's a big time freak.
How crazy.

1165
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:36,300
This is.
Sean Penn went to meet him.

1166
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,400
I went to meet him and did an article
for rolling stone shaking his hand.

1167
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,890
I mean,
it's unbelievable.

1168
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,590
What was he thinking?
You're a movie star,

1169
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:48,510
Dude.
Why do you want to go meet Pablo?

1170
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,970
Not Pablo Escobar,
but El Chapo

1171
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,190
didn't.
Did he give her and he,

1172
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,360
and I'm giving them,
they're like,

1173
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,160
did he have to tell someone where you
met him?

1174
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,560
Um,
or don't know why he says word

1175
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:02,140
journalistic.
Uh,

1176
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,390
like
freedom.

1177
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,770
I don't remember,
but I do remember that there was a girl

1178
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:10,500
that he knew there was an actress that
hooked it all up.

1179
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,480
Yeah.
She banging them.

1180
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,630
But that was going on.
I'm like,

1181
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,300
I hope so.
That's,

1182
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:19,490
that's what I like about narcos to
report a check.

1183
00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:20,670
Did he bang?
So every now and then,

1184
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:24,430
yeah,
breaking news.

1185
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:33,110
But that life's crazy to think about
that and they'll look at how they ran

1186
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:36,550
that and just scaring people.
And to be able to fight your own

1187
00:54:36,551 --> 00:54:39,250
government and lock yourself in and
escape.

1188
00:54:39,251 --> 00:54:41,680
And I'm the people for you,
but with you,

1189
00:54:41,681 --> 00:54:42,050
and it's

1190
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,210
scary.
But let's look at it this way.

1191
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:46,670
Is it scary than the people that sell
oxycontin?

1192
00:54:46,671 --> 00:54:49,470
The kills thousands of people every year
and nobody does a thing about it.

1193
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,920
They do a completely legal and
everybody's paid off.

1194
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:55,700
That might be scarier because yeah,
they don't have to use violence and

1195
00:54:55,701 --> 00:54:58,280
shoot people in the street and threaten
people and scare people.

1196
00:54:58,281 --> 00:55:03,281
And people don't live under this blanket
of fear that they lived under during the

1197
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,890
Pablo Escobar days.
But just many people are dying and just

1198
00:55:06,891 --> 00:55:09,590
as much money's being made,
maybe more people are dying.

1199
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,190
You are right.
And I mean about the fear thing,

1200
00:55:13,191 --> 00:55:16,940
like granted,
it's tough to compare the two,

1201
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:21,350
but if you compare all the people that
have been afraid of getting caught with

1202
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:23,390
marijuana over the past,
you know,

1203
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:27,440
decades,
because that I feel like has mostly been

1204
00:55:27,441 --> 00:55:32,441
brought on or at least kept in place by
big medicine then and all of that stuff

1205
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:39,041
that stemmed from marijuana and like a
selling marijuana and having a gun for

1206
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:41,540
marijuana and this and that and all that
stuff.

1207
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:45,080
Then you put all that together.
It's a much bigger imprint than it

1208
00:55:45,081 --> 00:55:46,040
seems,
you know?

1209
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:47,400
It's a big imprint,
but here's the,

1210
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:51,520
the weirdest one now in 2016 for the
first time,

1211
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:56,730
more people are using pain pills.
Then tobacco in the United States,

1212
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,790
including cigars,
Chu cigarettes,

1213
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,800
the whole thing,
everything.

1214
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,340
More people using fucking prescription
pain pills.

1215
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:07,930
Wow.
Then using tobacco,

1216
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,530
which is nuts because you can go down
any street and see people smoking

1217
00:56:11,531 --> 00:56:12,850
cigarettes everywhere you go.

1218
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:14,111
Oh yeah.
Not too long.

1219
00:56:14,111 --> 00:56:15,820
Or You,
I think you'd tried to have me look up

1220
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:20,080
how many prescriptions with like our out
for adderall and the u s and as I was

1221
00:56:20,081 --> 00:56:22,480
trying to look it up,
I don't think that that's like public

1222
00:56:22,481 --> 00:56:24,250
info.
Like wouldn't want that out there with

1223
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:26,920
it.
Well sometimes that stuff gets out in

1224
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:28,510
some sort of a way,
you know,

1225
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:31,330
cause I could,
I had a hard time finding it.

1226
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:35,290
I just had like rough guesstimations
different things.

1227
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,240
It's always happening based off of
whatever.

1228
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:38,890
But yeah,
so we were like,

1229
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:42,310
who lives in Florida?
You could go get 10 oxicon things like

1230
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:45,670
this and you just go over down to things
like those are being tracked.

1231
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:49,970
Same any more.
They used to be like that,

1232
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,210
but it's way different now.
Back then when they were doing that,

1233
00:56:53,211 --> 00:56:56,930
the oxycontin express days,
there was more people that were getting

1234
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,730
oxycontin prescriptions in Florida than
the rest of the country combined.

1235
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:06,280
Damn,
that's a Florida at Florida.

1236
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:11,290
So crazy is the strongest painkiller
that just makes you basically my heroin.

1237
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,590
It's not even the strongest painkiller,
the strongest painkillers.

1238
00:57:15,591 --> 00:57:17,060
That's tough.
How do you say it?

1239
00:57:17,061 --> 00:57:22,061
Phenological fentanyl,
fentanyl and fentanyl is spending a shit

1240
00:57:22,681 --> 00:57:26,510
load of money to try to keep marijuana
illegal in Arizona.

1241
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:31,750
They spent $500,000 to try to stop the
legalization of recreational marijuana

1242
00:57:34,881 --> 00:57:35,810
in Arizona

1243
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:40,320
downstairs.
Is that not a red flag then?

1244
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,250
How are they,
how can they do that

1245
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,500
creational thing on the ballot for the
California?

1246
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:48,030
Yes,
I remember it being discussed for

1247
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,910
English.
It's like it should be talked about a

1248
00:57:49,911 --> 00:57:50,420
lot.

1249
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,670
It should be talked about a lot.
Um,

1250
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:56,150
it's pretty much like established in
most people's eyes isn't just going to

1251
00:57:56,151 --> 00:57:57,380
pass.
Yeah.

1252
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:00,320
I mean once they see how much money
Colorado is raking in,

1253
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,420
plus Jerry Brown's,
our governor,

1254
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,980
that walking a hippie and a half

1255
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,120
wanting to the front of the shell or the
money too.

1256
00:58:06,121 --> 00:58:08,430
I was,
I saw articles in bring up recently on a

1257
00:58:08,431 --> 00:58:11,160
podcast,
but I forget how much they,

1258
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:13,770
it's,
it's as much as Colorado if not more.

1259
00:58:13,771 --> 00:58:17,130
And then I just saw some reason
Colorado's going $66 million,

1260
00:58:17,131 --> 00:58:21,480
they're going to go towards bully at
like advocacy or something like that.

1261
00:58:21,481 --> 00:58:23,460
Like they have that much of a surplus.
How,

1262
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,630
how do you stop bullying with money?
What do you do?

1263
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,190
Programs and stuff.
I think.

1264
00:58:29,191 --> 00:58:29,970
I don't know that they will.

1265
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:31,200
I'll tell you how,
what you do,

1266
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:35,250
you give the bullies the money.
That's how you do it.

1267
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,410
You get the bullies,
the money.

1268
00:58:37,411 --> 00:58:40,280
All of a sudden guess who's lunch money.
They're not taken.

1269
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,720
Do we be little sons?
How about that?

1270
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,980
Let's solve the epidemic right word.
Okay.

1271
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,350
The real way to solve it would be to
teach them how to fight.

1272
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,080
Teach a martial arts.
Yeah.

1273
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,850
They wouldn't be beaten each other up.
They'd be competing,

1274
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,160
you know,
or they look like pussies.

1275
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,090
When I was in like middle school that
try this thing was migrated school cause

1276
00:58:59,091 --> 00:59:02,810
we were known as like the ghetto school
up to like six or seven little catholic

1277
00:59:02,811 --> 00:59:05,030
schools in our area because we had black
kids at our school.

1278
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:07,000
And that's why you were known as the
ghetto school?

1279
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,873
Yeah,
I think so.

1280
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,650
I mean what,
we weren't in the ghetto or anything

1281
00:59:09,651 --> 00:59:11,930
like that and it was a private Catholic
school.

1282
00:59:11,931 --> 00:59:14,050
It's not like it's not,
it wasn't a free public.

1283
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:16,700
What was ghetto about it?
We don't like it.

1284
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:18,760
It riverbank.
Any black girls not.

1285
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:20,060
And I was in middle school.
No,

1286
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,093
no,
but not anyway.

1287
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:22,340
Um,
anyway,

1288
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:25,220
so we have to,
the dances we were delivering were like,

1289
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,710
this is the 19 nine in mid 96,
96 we're like rap music was still like

1290
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,990
gangster rap was getting big.
So some of all black kids liked it when

1291
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:36,860
they put it on it or a dance then start
like we jump around and everyone get

1292
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:41,930
little kids at a party raise 13 either
way all the parents or the kids at those

1293
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:43,670
schools didn't like it.

1294
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:48,260
So we got complained to or against and
for the next two years we had what they

1295
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:53,261
called conflict resolution as an actual
class instead of like art for some,

1296
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:58,511
for like a year where we had to like do
workshops and worksheets about how to be

1297
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:02,930
acting with other kids in situations
like it was,

1298
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,890
no one took it seriously at all.
But like they told us that's what it was

1299
01:00:06,891 --> 01:00:10,310
for us because we weren't acting like we
got banned from the dances at those

1300
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:12,350
schools that we couldn't go there and
get to have our own.

1301
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:16,460
Did you feel like a rebel?
No dumb.

1302
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:19,640
We didn't understand why it was done
when they were being picked off.

1303
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,910
What'd you guys literally it came from,
I remember an incident where there was

1304
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:27,800
like a song came on and a bunch of kids
from my school specifically gotten a a

1305
01:00:27,801 --> 01:00:30,020
circle and we're like jumping around
like put their hands up.

1306
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,570
I don't remember the song.
I've been slammed by Onyx and through,

1307
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:36,530
yeah it's so like all the white guy
went,

1308
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,510
this is what I think happened and I'm
pretty sure it did.

1309
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:41,210
Like all the white kids were like
freaking out like what the fuck's going

1310
01:00:41,211 --> 01:00:44,690
on and what has been the teachers that
were watching it over and won't like

1311
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:48,710
what are all these kids doing from the,
that school ghetto school over there on

1312
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:51,530
the east side.
We can't be having that with our kids.

1313
01:00:51,531 --> 01:00:54,750
Fuck that.
And they think they complained and then

1314
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:58,460
two years later,
once all those troubled kids are up in

1315
01:00:58,461 --> 01:01:00,650
high school and there's some new kids in
an aren't act enough,

1316
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,820
we'll try to dance and see how it goes.
And then

1317
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,010
I only went away and I got a dumb
question.

1318
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,950
That earpiece.
So you weren't [inaudible] has a

1319
01:01:07,951 --> 01:01:09,930
microphone on it.
That microphone is picking taken up,

1320
01:01:09,931 --> 01:01:11,850
right?
I'm just saying that you're thing man.

1321
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:16,200
So they segregated the dances.
Who wants to go to the all white people

1322
01:01:16,201 --> 01:01:17,280
dance?
You know what I mean?

1323
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,270
Why people don't want to be around black
people?

1324
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,230
Well I mean black people have the best
dances,

1325
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,580
I'll tell you that right now.

1326
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:27,720
What if you're in a line dancing though?
What have you like super into like

1327
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,220
white,
white dance.

1328
01:01:29,221 --> 01:01:29,680
Go.
I'll,

1329
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,950
he was blind.
The incident at least not around here.

1330
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:33,270
I was in the,
um,

1331
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:38,330
I was in a country restaurant bar once
and they all started lion dancing to

1332
01:01:38,551 --> 01:01:41,640
some fucking song.
They knew the song and they all started

1333
01:01:41,641 --> 01:01:44,820
doing this like dancing together and we
were looking at each other like,

1334
01:01:44,821 --> 01:01:49,320
what fuck is going on?
Like they all knew the song and they

1335
01:01:49,321 --> 01:01:51,690
were all dancing together.
But I do the dance,

1336
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,600
like the electric slide but not the
lectures.

1337
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:54,970
Right.
But like a

1338
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,910
backhoe fucking country dance.
Yeah.

1339
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,720
It's like wow.

1340
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,130
Yeah.
Have you ever seen a big group of black

1341
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:02,800
people do like,
uh,

1342
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:06,200
one of those dance flashmob things?
Yes.

1343
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,540
And it was awesome.
Wasn't it better?

1344
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:10,250
I thought I saw one,
two,

1345
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,520
three,
three or four summers ago in San Diego.

1346
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,570
I remember.
It's when,

1347
01:02:14,571 --> 01:02:17,360
um,
Kanye and Jay z got together and they

1348
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:21,780
made an album and he made a song,
Edwards words in Paris and it's stole

1349
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:26,040
this summer and it was just one of those
songs where you are hearing it all

1350
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,960
summer and it had a big beat and
everything.

1351
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:32,820
We were in an outdoor bar in San Diego
and all of a sudden it came on and it

1352
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:35,730
was like a hot Saturday night,
middle of the summer.

1353
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,240
And all of a sudden it came,
they came around the corner like doing

1354
01:02:39,241 --> 01:02:42,660
like it was almost like you were in the
music video thriller and,

1355
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:47,460
and I'm looking at them and then I take
a moment cause I'm sorta like creepily

1356
01:02:47,461 --> 01:02:48,480
aware,
you know what I mean?

1357
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:53,340
To look around and see what the white
people are doing it this like outdoor

1358
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:57,390
bar and everybody was just mesmerized.
It was like,

1359
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:01,800
I dunno like Cirque de Solei except it
was just a bunch of cool black people

1360
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:03,840
dancing,
walking down the street at the same time

1361
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,850
in synchronization with each other.

1362
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,870
Yeah.
So many videotapes,

1363
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:11,000
some flash mob in the middle of New York
City on a day like,

1364
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,940
yeah.
They had some thing where everybody

1365
01:03:12,941 --> 01:03:15,420
agreed to meet at a certain place at a
certain time.

1366
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:19,270
Then when the clock strikes midnight,
everybody fucking jumps in and gets

1367
01:03:19,271 --> 01:03:22,090
crazy and dances around.
I love shit like that.

1368
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,640
Yeah,
because that's not organized by a

1369
01:03:24,641 --> 01:03:29,641
company that's not like some marketing
campaign from some cell phone provider.

1370
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:34,480
That's an organic thing that people just
decided to get crazy.

1371
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:36,980
Yeah.
When the intentions are just to be

1372
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:38,450
silly,
just to have fun.

1373
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,620
That's what makes it worse.

1374
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,090
Yeah.
To kind of happen.

1375
01:03:41,091 --> 01:03:43,340
When we were in San Francisco this year,
the Nag,

1376
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:47,420
I walked to the top of Fremont Street,
that's what the lining one.

1377
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,810
And uh,
the meeting of the naked bike bike ride

1378
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:54,560
was up there and it was just,
it was all guys Lombard Street,

1379
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:58,100
our street off for much the naked bike
riders,

1380
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:02,720
medical guys all over 40.
None at like all out of shape.

1381
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:05,960
But they were all button naked on a bike
in the middle,

1382
01:04:05,961 --> 01:04:10,961
like noon mill coffee on their huffy.
It was not the right flash nod to be

1383
01:04:11,271 --> 01:04:16,271
walking into worst flight ever naked
dudes on bicycles.

1384
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,020
The flashing,

1385
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,560
flashing flash mobs.
Interesting.

1386
01:04:20,561 --> 01:04:23,930
Then that clothes are mandatory if you
take your clothes off the throwing of

1387
01:04:23,931 --> 01:04:24,530
fucking jail.

1388
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:27,670
Well there was a thick cops there that
weren't really doing anything well in

1389
01:04:27,671 --> 01:04:28,670
San Francisco.
Yeah,

1390
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:33,580
I was thinking about that the other day
cause I was driving back from Sacramento

1391
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:38,410
middle of the day on Sunday.
And I literally,

1392
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:41,140
I went through the drive through,
they gave me a burger.

1393
01:04:41,141 --> 01:04:43,360
I didn't,
they didn't put Napkins in the bag.

1394
01:04:43,361 --> 01:04:44,590
And I'm like,
I'm eating on the road,

1395
01:04:44,591 --> 01:04:47,800
I want to make it back to la,
blah blah blah blah.

1396
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:51,430
An hour later I'm finishing my coffee,
just state that Burger,

1397
01:04:51,431 --> 01:04:55,300
no napkins and the car finished my uh,
or no,

1398
01:04:55,301 --> 01:04:59,020
I didn't and that anyway,
and I start to have to shit and I mean

1399
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:04,021
like badly and I mean like it's an
immediate emergency and I'm looking and

1400
01:05:04,271 --> 01:05:08,050
it's one of those stretches in northern
California where it's like next rest

1401
01:05:08,051 --> 01:05:11,050
area,
43 miles and I'm looking as I'm driving

1402
01:05:11,051 --> 01:05:12,940
on the freeway,
I'm looking to see like what kind of

1403
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:16,930
bushes there are and stuff and there's
like nothing and I mean nothing.

1404
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,860
It's just fucking cow pastors forever.
And I'm like,

1405
01:05:20,861 --> 01:05:23,140
fuck,
can't ship behind that can't shut behind

1406
01:05:23,141 --> 01:05:23,861
them.
You know,

1407
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:26,950
you're just driving down looking,
you're squeezing them and I'm squeezing

1408
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:31,720
and squeezing so hard that for the first
time in my life I was like standing up

1409
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:34,150
while driving like I was,
I was,

1410
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,280
I was up on my left foot because it felt
like my butt cheeks could get tighter if

1411
01:05:39,281 --> 01:05:43,570
I like was in a standing position rather
than setting and I mean I'm doing

1412
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:45,940
everything.
I'm literally praying to God for the

1413
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:50,230
first time in like five or six years.
I mean like I'm literally like whatever.

1414
01:05:50,231 --> 01:05:52,600
If anything is controlling any of the
universe,

1415
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:53,710
I need your right now

1416
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:58,080
I can't ship
because by the way,

1417
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:01,970
they were also,
I was wearing these like gray shorts.

1418
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:08,420
They're like cloth shorts.
I mean it would have been so terrible,

1419
01:06:08,421 --> 01:06:10,430
so terrible.
And

1420
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,030
what the fuck were we just talking?
No shirt.

1421
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:14,710
Oh,
about not having clothes on.

1422
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:17,580
I realized right then like I'm like,
I'm Ha,

1423
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:22,630
I'm going to have to pull over on the
side of the street and without a Bush

1424
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:25,660
I'm going to have to,
shit boobs going to come out of my butt

1425
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,560
no matter what happens.
And people are going to drive by and I'm

1426
01:06:29,561 --> 01:06:33,430
thinking to myself how illegal that is.
Cause I think like he can't even pull

1427
01:06:33,431 --> 01:06:37,960
your pants down and get away with it.
Well that happens and I'm thinking

1428
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:40,660
that's crazy being naked.
It's crazy.

1429
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:45,661
But we all Poop and pee all of us 100%
of all people.

1430
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:52,850
But you have to find a public bathroom.
Like you can't just knock on someone's

1431
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:55,270
door of the freeway public.
It is.

1432
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:56,320
I'm kind of,
yes it is.

1433
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,660
Yeah,
but you're not allowed to shit outside.

1434
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,150
Like if you pee outside,
here's where it gets really interesting.

1435
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:02,380
Yeah.
If you pee outside,

1436
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,930
you get caught.
You can be arrested as a sex offender.

1437
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:09,490
It happened to people before it,
especially if you were in view of a

1438
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:10,260
school,

1439
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,140
you could go from a brown alert to an
amber alert real quick.

1440
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:18,950
Okey dokey.
How did you resolve it?

1441
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,210
Wow.
What ended up happening

1442
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:25,740
was my prayers to the universe ended up
working because like,

1443
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:30,150
you know how every once in awhile,
how close you've been to shitting your

1444
01:07:30,151 --> 01:07:33,450
pants lately.
But like it bubbles up and you're like,

1445
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:34,020
fuck off.
Fuck off.

1446
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:34,890
Fuck.
You know what I mean?

1447
01:07:34,891 --> 01:07:37,290
And then sometimes it'll just be like,
all right,

1448
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,153
let them,
you know,

1449
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:40,110
let them go for a little bit and it'll
just be,

1450
01:07:40,111 --> 01:07:42,150
everything will be okay for like two
minutes.

1451
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:43,450
Oh my God.
Did it pass?

1452
01:07:43,451 --> 01:07:45,270
It's like a hurricane.
It's like when you hear people

1453
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,760
describing hurricanes,
I thought the eye,

1454
01:07:47,761 --> 01:07:52,761
the eye of the storm Rd.
And then two minutes later it Garner and

1455
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:57,540
I ended up making it.
And what's crazy that I do remember

1456
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:02,160
about this and I made it to the first
gas station that was 41 miles.

1457
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,630
I mean I was just sweating,
dude,

1458
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:07,740
I don't know how to describe it.
I'm like 40 miles quenching emergency

1459
01:08:07,741 --> 01:08:10,080
shit.
You bought off the chair the whole time.

1460
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,060
My left leg was sore,
my whole alignment is off.

1461
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:20,860
I get adjusted to go to a reiki master.
And what's crazy is that because like

1462
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:26,810
there's actually another piece to this
amazing puzzle is that after you've been

1463
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:31,811
holding it for 41 miles or whatever and
you know even do all this shit and once

1464
01:08:32,661 --> 01:08:37,550
you make it to the closest restroom,
that first gas station off that first

1465
01:08:37,551 --> 01:08:40,370
exit and you go to the men's room and
you're in,

1466
01:08:40,371 --> 01:08:41,990
there's only one stall there.

1467
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:43,450
Okay.

1468
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:45,820
That is the stall of

1469
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:49,930
demolition my friend.
I mean once I was in and I was,

1470
01:08:49,931 --> 01:08:53,560
I mean you just notice there's graffiti
everywhere.

1471
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:56,560
There's toilet paper.
Every everything you've ever seen is

1472
01:08:56,590 --> 01:09:01,440
everywhere because that is the stall of
anybody who's almost shit there.

1473
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:05,620
Every man coming southbound from
northern California that had to shit in

1474
01:09:05,621 --> 01:09:10,621
this 40 miles span class through that
door and the glass through that stall

1475
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:16,681
door and just,
I mean it is the stall.

1476
01:09:16,901 --> 01:09:20,170
So that's what's crazy is that like yeah
there was a few other gas stations on

1477
01:09:20,171 --> 01:09:22,850
that exit but I'm like,
I remember literally being like,

1478
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:25,300
ah,
like I was in that final red light.

1479
01:09:25,301 --> 01:09:27,340
Cause you're,
once you see it's a weird thing your

1480
01:09:27,341 --> 01:09:28,600
body does too.
It is,

1481
01:09:28,601 --> 01:09:31,180
once you see the gas station,
you see the restroom,

1482
01:09:31,181 --> 01:09:33,160
that's when it's like,
you know,

1483
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:36,120
it's like real people,
like I said,

1484
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,970
a fixed set of faces but just like can't
take it anymore.

1485
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:41,170
It's like there it is.

1486
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,230
It is really fucking bizarre that you
are not allowed to be naked.

1487
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:48,980
Yeah.
Like that your body comes like out of

1488
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:53,870
the box with no clothes.
We require you to purchase clothes or

1489
01:09:53,871 --> 01:09:55,910
make them,
I mean if you,

1490
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:58,340
I guess you could have a bunch of leaves
glued together.

1491
01:09:58,341 --> 01:10:01,310
No one could stop you as long as no one
can see your genitals.

1492
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:05,360
And then even then we have like rules
for that.

1493
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:10,750
Like a girl can wear a thong.
So literally she can have a string that

1494
01:10:11,511 --> 01:10:16,511
goes over her asshole and then just a
little Dorito that covers her clit and

1495
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:20,360
we're like,
we're good.

1496
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,410
We're good.
Oh do you have uh,

1497
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,710
some bandaids for your nipples?
Cause I don't want to see your dirty

1498
01:10:24,711 --> 01:10:28,220
fucking stinky brown skin,
Brown nipple skin.

1499
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:30,800
You dirty bitch.
Like you'd see all the,

1500
01:10:30,801 --> 01:10:34,880
the voluptuousness of the outside.
It's very weird.

1501
01:10:34,881 --> 01:10:38,090
We're real weird with clothes.
It is like you could have like beaches

1502
01:10:38,091 --> 01:10:40,430
where people get nude,
but you have to have an agreement.

1503
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,590
Like this is the,
this is the beach where everybody's

1504
01:10:42,591 --> 01:10:45,830
allowed to not wear clothes,
but for the most part you have to wear

1505
01:10:45,831 --> 01:10:46,664
clothes.

1506
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,593
That's

1507
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:52,580
it was interested to hear for,
we're moving a camera,

1508
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,920
taking a picture,
like eight guys in running a camera or

1509
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:58,250
canoeing down the thing.
They stopped and it was like drinking a

1510
01:10:58,251 --> 01:11:00,350
beer and everything like that.
Everyone took a picture and I was like,

1511
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,240
let's get the fuck outta here.
You're like,

1512
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,111
oh,
let's take a picture.

1513
01:11:03,111 --> 01:11:03,831
And then I was like,
all right,

1514
01:11:03,831 --> 01:11:05,540
I'll take a fucking picture.
So everyone's,

1515
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,220
I moved the camera,
so we did.

1516
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:11,840
And literally like two minutes later out
of the woods in the middle of nowhere,

1517
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,550
a sheriff comes down like,
hey guys.

1518
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:15,810
Hey,
we're all like,

1519
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:16,401
what?
What,

1520
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:17,760
what?
What's going on?

1521
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:18,480
He's like,
hey,

1522
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,040
why don't you come over here?
We're all like,

1523
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:23,040
aw fuck would we do,
and also the half of us are under age,

1524
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:27,780
like some like 20212120120 two,
the 208 people I think.

1525
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:30,150
And you're not supposed to be drinking
while you're canoeing too.

1526
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,320
So we knew we were kind of fucked.
Uh,

1527
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,860
but he makes us all walk over to him and
he's like,

1528
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:36,930
Hey,
just so you guys know what you just did

1529
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:39,710
is absolutely legal and we're thinking
about it.

1530
01:11:39,711 --> 01:11:40,350
He's like,
we,

1531
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:41,980
he's like,
we're thinking about uh,

1532
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,450
taking you all in right now for indecent
exposure and we're all media.

1533
01:11:45,451 --> 01:11:47,460
Like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

1534
01:11:47,461 --> 01:11:49,110
He's like,
who's we first was like,

1535
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:49,501
oh,
we're all,

1536
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:52,740
we spent up there watching you through
all five of us going up binoculars.

1537
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,990
We'd been here for,
washed your class 25 minutes.

1538
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:55,891
It's like,
guys,

1539
01:11:55,891 --> 01:11:58,500
we should have definitely left.
It should have so left.

1540
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:01,410
And he like pulls the,
to underage people up next to him.

1541
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,780
My girlfriend at the time and this other
kid,

1542
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:06,120
he makes us dumped out all of our
liquor.

1543
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:09,120
Like one girl,
I kept the bike hit a bottle of Jack

1544
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:09,951
Daniels in any,
if I was like,

1545
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,400
all right,
you know what we're going to remember,

1546
01:12:11,401 --> 01:12:13,970
we'll let you guys go but get the fuck
like get the fuck out of here.

1547
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,710
Nothing ended up happening.
But enemy,

1548
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,450
he also meant,
he said they're like,

1549
01:12:18,451 --> 01:12:21,930
it's okay for all you girls to take
pictures with your tops off

1550
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:23,533
but

1551
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,340
no asses.
That's illegal.

1552
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:28,180
We're all like,
Huh.

1553
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:32,700
And like I guess from then I've always
like thought or that's I think when I

1554
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:35,430
learned that like girls are allowed to
walk around with their tops off.

1555
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,220
Honestly I think it's some states that
we're in Ohio now.

1556
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,230
Yeah.
And then the different New York you can

1557
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:42,660
do it right.
That was like a thing that they fought

1558
01:12:42,661 --> 01:12:45,840
for it because men can walk around with
no shirts on in New York.

1559
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,850
But you know,
up until like the beginning of the,

1560
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:51,840
to the turn of the 20th century,
it was illegal for men to walk around

1561
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,480
bare shirt and it was like a big Oh
yeah.

1562
01:12:54,481 --> 01:12:57,390
There's like a big movement where I
think,

1563
01:12:57,391 --> 01:13:00,180
I want to say like the early 1,980,
the teens,

1564
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,760
they uh,
they duked it out.

1565
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,020
Like they,
you know,

1566
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:07,140
they,
they fought to have decency thing too.

1567
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,860
Well,
I mean men fought to,

1568
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:13,620
to have the right to walk around
shirtless cause fucking hot out

1569
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:17,010
sometimes,
but women couldn't for like a long time,

1570
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:22,320
I want to say until fairly recently.
And apps obviously like,

1571
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,950
look,
I understand that a woman's breasts is

1572
01:13:25,951 --> 01:13:28,230
more titillating,
no pun intended.

1573
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:31,080
But you,
you can't say like,

1574
01:13:31,081 --> 01:13:33,840
men can walk around with their dicks
hanging out,

1575
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:36,030
but when we can't show their vaginas,
that's just crazy.

1576
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:37,200
It is.
Besides that,

1577
01:13:37,201 --> 01:13:40,350
are there nipples have to be covered in
our nimbleness or just like,

1578
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:44,410
who's looking fuck monitor useless slam
my nipple and a fucking bag fault.

1579
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:45,263
I wouldn't feel it.

1580
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:48,960
It's different.
Numb.

1581
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:51,120
They don't,
they literally don't feel like anything.

1582
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,640
They don't do anything.
I had a girl suck on him once.

1583
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:54,720
I was like,
you could just stop.

1584
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,820
Why don't you just suck on my elbow?
It's the same thing.

1585
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,430
It is.
So my elbow might be more sensitive.

1586
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:06,370
Yeah.
That's so true.

1587
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:09,590
It's weird because women's nipples get
erect.

1588
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,100
They get excited,
they perk up,

1589
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:15,040
no milk shoots out sometimes,
you know,

1590
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,720
excited.
Whoa.

1591
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:19,070
Yeah,
they really,

1592
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:22,220
they really like it.
I think that for a long time I always

1593
01:14:22,221 --> 01:14:26,540
thought that a boobs for girls were the
same like for guys.

1594
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:29,900
And it was like not that much feeling.
So I sort of like always ignored them.

1595
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:33,260
This vagina thing is the most important

1596
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:36,160
and uh,
man,

1597
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,230
I learned a little bit later on that
like girls like that their boots are

1598
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:41,280
different than our boobs.
Yeah.

1599
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:42,920
Like last week,
a couple of weeks ago.

1600
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:46,940
Yeah.
That's interesting.

1601
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:51,050
It's interesting that the differences,
what we're allowed to get away with,

1602
01:14:51,051 --> 01:14:53,210
what we're not allowed to get away with.
You know,

1603
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:56,720
like imagine it men wore skirts to
meetings.

1604
01:14:57,350 --> 01:15:01,340
If Mandy can have like little skirts,
no killed.

1605
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:02,840
Yeah.
Kind of do.

1606
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:06,110
But that's like this does,
does a dress I think goes down your

1607
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,820
knees.
Yeah.

1608
01:15:07,821 --> 01:15:10,560
And it's got like a big belt buckle and
stuff to make it cool.

1609
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:13,960
I think thinking of pilgrims
sometimes they,

1610
01:15:13,961 --> 01:15:17,240
I got a little Satchel thing,
it's like a fanny pack.

1611
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,150
You mean like,
I'm sorry but it had,

1612
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:22,840
I pooped off that side of that road and
just been like poop coming out of my

1613
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:26,320
butt and like a police officer comes and
arrest me for that.

1614
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,640
I would make no pun intended,
but I would make a really big stink

1615
01:15:30,641 --> 01:15:35,641
about that because I mean it's like it's
supposed to shit your pants in your car,

1616
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:38,770
just deal with it.
I that's the question,

1617
01:15:38,771 --> 01:15:40,000
right?
What do you do?

1618
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:41,920
And by the way,
it was a rental car.

1619
01:15:41,921 --> 01:15:44,800
I knew there was one more thing I was
forgetting a rental car with the gray

1620
01:15:44,801 --> 01:15:46,830
interior gray cloth Interior Nolan

1621
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:49,060
that you pay for the insurance or how's
that work?

1622
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:53,260
Well you should take that cup from the
coffee and just shit right in that

1623
01:15:53,261 --> 01:15:55,530
coffee thing was,
is that it was a fenty.

1624
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:57,340
It was tall.

1625
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:59,650
I'm already shit in it.

1626
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:01,880
We squeezed shut,
tossing out the window.

1627
01:16:01,881 --> 01:16:06,110
You put it right back in there.
You keep filling it up.

1628
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:09,950
Ah.
Have you ever taken a shit where it

1629
01:16:09,951 --> 01:16:13,460
comes out like a volcano above the water
and you're like,

1630
01:16:13,461 --> 01:16:15,530
oh my God,
this is an above ground shit.

1631
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:19,280
I could literally so much shit that it's
rising above the water.

1632
01:16:19,281 --> 01:16:21,590
The toilet,
my 12th my current one's a little too

1633
01:16:21,591 --> 01:16:23,820
small for me.
All your shit and a lot of shit and

1634
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,550
hardcore.
No water in there.

1635
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:30,750
A lot of meat.
Does it ever a climb all the way up to

1636
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:32,000
get that extra smell?
You're like,

1637
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:35,183
well shit,

1638
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:41,590
when the smell becomes three D
it's literally going above the water.

1639
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:50,500
It's out in the air.
It's quite strange.

1640
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:53,350
Well No,
I mean not entirely,

1641
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:55,810
but obviously I'm walking up bathroom
just so much shit.

1642
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:58,160
Well it's still gas,
but I need a steak.

1643
01:16:58,190 --> 01:16:59,970
It's a bit traps a lot then there.
Yeah.

1644
01:16:59,971 --> 01:17:03,160
What's with the matches?
Is that like burning the gas in there?

1645
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,550
Is that what that's supposed to be
about?

1646
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,300
I would just set it out a lot.
I think at a,

1647
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:10,130
the fire sucks oxygen,
so must have to be sucking some

1648
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:14,210
other gas and fucking with it,
but I think it's,

1649
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:16,670
I think it's just the,
the software.

1650
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:20,280
That was the thing that I need.
Just know that someone shitting there so

1651
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:24,410
better than smelling shit,
you know it's getting in your,

1652
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:27,740
on your tongue because it knows it's
fitting and you're tasting it.

1653
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:29,960
Right.
Just smelling shift molecules.

1654
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:32,330
Yeah.
If you could smell it in the air,

1655
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,760
it's everywhere.
[inaudible] dealt with the gas

1656
01:17:34,761 --> 01:17:39,761
molecules.
What am weird design and that every

1657
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:44,170
animal has he eat things.
Anybody's like I would take all is

1658
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:46,070
useful stuff.
We've got a lot of garbage.

1659
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:51,170
I was just get rid of that stuff.
It comes out like there's no way he did.

1660
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:54,560
There's no way you can eat just the
right amount of food where you don't

1661
01:17:54,561 --> 01:17:58,230
ever shit or you don't ever piss.
It just goes to your studio.

1662
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:00,700
I've been here,
I've heard a recent story again it on,

1663
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:05,090
remember why this came up,
but like recall rectal implant.

1664
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,830
What's that called?
The feed fecal implant.

1665
01:18:06,831 --> 01:18:10,220
Fecal implant.
Some guy I was sick and he had to have

1666
01:18:10,221 --> 01:18:12,890
his friendship with them or something
like that and it made him better.

1667
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,680
That's disgusting and really weird how
that works.

1668
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:19,160
That does work.
Somebody else's shit put into something

1669
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:21,820
wrong.
He got somebody else to shift with them

1670
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,210
and fix this,
this stomach.

1671
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:24,110
So yeah.
Well,

1672
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:29,390
Gut Flora is one of the most important
aspects of health that is only really

1673
01:18:29,391 --> 01:18:31,670
being understood over the last few
decades.

1674
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:35,950
People really didn't know that the
bacteria inside your gut has not,

1675
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:38,390
not only does it just affect your
stomach,

1676
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:42,190
but it affects your personalities.
Are Neurons in the guide or some affects

1677
01:18:42,191 --> 01:18:43,460
your mood?
Well,

1678
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,690
not that it's just the,
there's a,

1679
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:49,550
some sort of a symbiotic relationship
that we have with our gut flora.

1680
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,060
And when your flora is bad,
it has all sorts of negative

1681
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,770
consequences on your immune system.

1682
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:59,990
I'm big enough probiotics.
Over the last few years I've been eating

1683
01:18:59,991 --> 01:19:02,270
a lot of Kimchi.
I drink,

1684
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:04,160
um,
what is that stuff called?

1685
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:06,260
Dot.
Keifer is a Kefir or Keith,

1686
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:07,470
I think a key for it,
but I don't know.

1687
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,320
I never really say it.
And read it.

1688
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:11,090
Um,
Kombucha,

1689
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:13,970
lots of different probiotics.
I take those on it.

1690
01:19:13,971 --> 01:19:16,580
Total gut health packets.
If I've got a stack with me,

1691
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:19,670
I travel on the road with it and don't
go on it anyway without it.

1692
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:22,100
But acid awfulness,
like all that kind of stuff,

1693
01:19:22,101 --> 01:19:26,690
like having a healthy gut flora and it
makes a giant difference on whether you

1694
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:30,470
get sick,
how long your sickness and lasts you

1695
01:19:30,471 --> 01:19:33,470
can't his or can you take too much of
that where your body just get rid of it?

1696
01:19:33,471 --> 01:19:37,100
If it doesn't want it to be a question,
I would imagine.

1697
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:38,150
Well,
it's healthy.

1698
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,220
I don't know if it's,
I don't think it's like,

1699
01:19:40,221 --> 01:19:43,490
uh,
like certain vitamins are fat soluble

1700
01:19:43,491 --> 01:19:46,310
and if you take too many of them in,
it could fuck with you and you really

1701
01:19:46,311 --> 01:19:47,480
want to make sure we get the right
amount.

1702
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,790
I don't think that's the same with,
um,

1703
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:53,720
with,
with healthy bacteria it's really,

1704
01:19:53,721 --> 01:19:57,080
it's like almost like troops.
Like you're bringing in healthy troops

1705
01:19:57,081 --> 01:19:59,360
to fight off bad,
bad bacteria,

1706
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:02,630
like for people to do Jujitsu.
Anybody who's listening to this and does

1707
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:05,060
Jujitsu,
super important that you take

1708
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:06,740
probiotics.
It's very,

1709
01:20:06,741 --> 01:20:11,050
very,
and never wash yourself with antibiotic

1710
01:20:11,051 --> 01:20:13,920
soap ever.
Cause when you wash yourself with

1711
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:17,040
antibiotics,
so it'd be stripped your body of all gut

1712
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:21,240
flora or of all skin flora of the good
stuff to you.

1713
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:26,040
What you want to do is use something
like defense soap that has healthy oils

1714
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:30,630
that only promotes healthy flora and,
but it doesn't kill the,

1715
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:31,710
uh,
the good stuff.

1716
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:36,740
It promotes healthy flora and protects
you from the bad shit from getting like

1717
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:38,664
ring Marlin's.
Yeah,

1718
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:43,230
but it's not an antibiotic bacteria.
So like antibacteria so I had a friend

1719
01:20:43,231 --> 01:20:45,930
of mine who was a Jujitsu guy who had a
ringworm.

1720
01:20:45,931 --> 01:20:50,520
He started washing themselves with
antibacterial soap and he got fucking

1721
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:53,730
ringworm everywhere because his body
couldn't fight it off

1722
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,700
legal now or something.
Or it's antibacterial is something or a

1723
01:20:57,701 --> 01:20:59,640
certain kinds of,
there's a certain camouflaged most of

1724
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:02,230
them.
Well we don't have jamie to check facts

1725
01:21:02,231 --> 01:21:02,510
check.

1726
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:05,100
Jamie started talking about throwing
around questions,

1727
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,360
start thinking about things that,
I remember,

1728
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,200
Jay,
if we were doing the regular podcast at

1729
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,540
the studio,
Jamie would have the answers up on the

1730
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:16,460
screen.
But now Jamie's like throwing the

1731
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:17,310
question.

1732
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:18,830
Yeah,
yeah.

1733
01:21:18,831 --> 01:21:19,640
FDA

1734
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,170
issues,
final rule,

1735
01:21:21,171 --> 01:21:24,260
safeties and effectiveness of
antibacterial soaps.

1736
01:21:24,261 --> 01:21:29,261
Bands try glisten and 18 other chemicals
from soaps to track.

1737
01:21:29,331 --> 01:21:33,690
Listen is something that it was found in
lots of things like from toothpaste to

1738
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:35,540
have antibacterial soap.
I guess it's no,

1739
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,433
it's no Bueno.

1740
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:40,440
What's the deal with fluoride?
Like what's the real deal with fluoride?

1741
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:45,600
Because fluoride is fucking poison.
But I've heard people say that fluoride

1742
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:50,601
is good for like for uh,
for healthy teeth and prevent tooth

1743
01:21:51,511 --> 01:21:53,100
decay.
But then I've heard that's total

1744
01:21:53,101 --> 01:21:55,110
bullshit.
And the only thing that's helping your

1745
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:57,450
tooth decay is that you're not broken.
You know,

1746
01:21:57,451 --> 01:21:59,610
you're,
you're cleaning your teeth and that's

1747
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:01,620
what's healthy.
But it's not the fluoride,

1748
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,920
nothing.
They put it in the water supply and

1749
01:22:03,921 --> 01:22:05,150
people thought that that's poisoning.

1750
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:07,100
Yeah.
That's where people think that it's like

1751
01:22:07,101 --> 01:22:12,101
designed to make you stupid.
This is a shitty new search to know

1752
01:22:12,801 --> 01:22:13,560
about that.
Yeah.

1753
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:17,030
This is a terrible fucking research
podcast.

1754
01:22:17,031 --> 01:22:19,700
This one,
you're upset at this.

1755
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:20,960
You should be a very rough

1756
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:25,120
fucking guys.
All they have is questions.

1757
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:26,400
No accident.

1758
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:32,350
We're going to have a companion podcast
to this where we actually check

1759
01:22:32,351 --> 01:22:33,184
everything

1760
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:38,350
then as usual.
It's kind of funny though that

1761
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:43,500
we do have this whole ecosystem thing
going on in our body that it's not just

1762
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:47,440
your body.
You have to prep your body from invading

1763
01:22:47,441 --> 01:22:48,730
bacteria.
No,

1764
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:52,030
your body is filled with bacteria.
It's like the whole thing's bacteria.

1765
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:54,610
It's like you're like a little planet.
Yeah.

1766
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:55,683
It's weird.

1767
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,760
We were,
we made,

1768
01:22:58,761 --> 01:23:02,750
we were made from like calm being in
like a hot vagina.

1769
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:06,370
Even crazy math were made from stars
exploding first.

1770
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:07,530
Okay.

1771
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:12,380
It had a star had explode in order to
create the very building blocks for

1772
01:23:12,381 --> 01:23:14,780
life.
What in the fuck

1773
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:17,840
it didn't much shoes last week.

1774
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:20,863
Uh,

1775
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,050
lot of stars out there,
Joshua.

1776
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

1777
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:28,600
Rarely felt like nothing.
Did you love it?

1778
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:30,250
This is amazing.
Yeah.

1779
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:32,920
It's so great.
I need to get out to Joshua tree.

1780
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,600
It's so beautiful out there.

1781
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:35,250
Wait,
when,

1782
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,600
when is already do that?
Shrimp fest is July,

1783
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:42,940
I think it was September this year.
It rotates either in July or August or

1784
01:23:42,941 --> 01:23:45,280
September.
A lot depends on the super moon.

1785
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:47,380
Oh,
he only does it during the supermarket.

1786
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,940
Yeah.
The weekend of the Super Moon.

1787
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:51,610
Like the week of we can go outside.
Yeah.

1788
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:53,620
Yeah.
Mm.

1789
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:57,490
Bright Moon.
That was interesting.

1790
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:00,860
This one was a different one because
this wasn't officially stream fast.

1791
01:24:00,861 --> 01:24:04,210
We just went cause we all missed,
well I missed shroom fast,

1792
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:05,680
which was a couple of months ago or
whatever.

1793
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:09,880
But uh,
and this one didn't have the moon out

1794
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:13,030
right away.
So it was actually my first time in four

1795
01:24:13,031 --> 01:24:17,290
or five years without the moon.
Crazy as that is.

1796
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:21,730
But it was there in a few hours,
but it wasn't there the first few hours

1797
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:24,850
in the stars out there.
I mean there's just no way to describe

1798
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:27,650
it.
They're just fucking everywhere you

1799
01:24:27,651 --> 01:24:30,200
would do when you can't look at a
specific place and not see it.

1800
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:34,120
A huge column for them.
And you can't look at the sky for 30

1801
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:37,960
seconds to two minutes in a row without
seeing another shooting star.

1802
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:39,790
It's impossible.
Wow.

1803
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:42,100
If you're not seeing one,
then you're looking down.

1804
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:45,820
Isn't that crazy that those are rocks
from space?

1805
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:48,340
It probably came from millions of miles.

1806
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:50,490
Well,
and I was out there.

1807
01:24:50,491 --> 01:24:52,800
I was thinking about how that was the
natural,

1808
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:55,680
how that had to be like the first form
of entertainment.

1809
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:58,480
Like what else would you watch?
Yeah,

1810
01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:01,830
there was no falling asleep to Netflix.
It was,

1811
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:05,820
I saw the stars last night and uh,
that was it.

1812
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:09,480
And you hear a twig snap behind you that
was entertaining.

1813
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:16,440
You're out there wandering around on
mushrooms.

1814
01:25:16,441 --> 01:25:18,210
You worry about spiders or anything like
that.

1815
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:20,103
Yeah,

1816
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:24,070
I was afraid of a little,
we had a little,

1817
01:25:24,071 --> 01:25:27,790
a little mouse that kept running around
our campsite that at one point I was

1818
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:32,791
like way too afraid of,
was it a mouse or the tiniest little

1819
01:25:33,781 --> 01:25:35,380
mouse?
Little Cutie mouth.

1820
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:36,620
It was freaking me out.
Yeah,

1821
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:38,700
it was freaking me out.
I'm just getting too close.

1822
01:25:38,701 --> 01:25:40,860
It seemed like it was on mushrooms with
us.

1823
01:25:40,861 --> 01:25:42,300
And I'm like,
get Outta here dude.

1824
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:44,020
Maybe like new.
You guys were vulnerable.

1825
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:46,330
It felt like it did close it on.
Yeah.

1826
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:49,210
Yeah.
Animals definitely know the difference

1827
01:25:49,211 --> 01:25:53,560
between dark and day.
I think it really bold at night as

1828
01:25:53,561 --> 01:25:56,590
opposed to during the day.
During the day they keep the fuck away

1829
01:25:56,591 --> 01:25:59,740
from me and be like deer at night.
They're not nearly as worried about

1830
01:25:59,741 --> 01:26:02,340
people.
That's like almost like they know all

1831
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:04,010
these fuckheads.
They can't see that good

1832
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:07,910
like look bears.
It's really disturbing.

1833
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,640
Like bears at nighttime they didn't do
very,

1834
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:14,600
very like confident.
They're not nervous about people at all.

1835
01:26:14,601 --> 01:26:17,360
If you ever around bears at night,
as it starts getting dark,

1836
01:26:17,361 --> 01:26:19,700
they start closing in on you and looking
at you differently.

1837
01:26:19,810 --> 01:26:21,490
Did bears have good nighttime vision?

1838
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,520
Oh yeah.
A lot of them were very nocturnal.

1839
01:26:24,030 --> 01:26:25,660
All animals are.
Oh,

1840
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:28,160
you mean almost all animals can see way
better

1841
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:29,530
and then we don't.
We have nothing.

1842
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:30,903
We have no

1843
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:33,670
mission there,
but we have night vision goggles and

1844
01:26:33,671 --> 01:26:38,170
guns and cars.
It's not like biological evolution,

1845
01:26:38,171 --> 01:26:39,370
but it's,
we still,

1846
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,370
we still got there.
We have a machine gun.

1847
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:47,050
If sitting out the sunroof and played
Panama from led Zeppelin or from a van

1848
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:48,190
Halen rather.
I was like blown away

1849
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,670
Panama.

1850
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,570
Got them down.
Fuck your evolution.

1851
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:58,380
How about that?
I'm a fuck you night vision.

1852
01:26:59,370 --> 01:27:02,130
You could see you bitch.
Stop trying to eat me.

1853
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,060
Yeah.
Bugs,

1854
01:27:06,061 --> 01:27:08,700
snakes.
All those things out in Joshua tree are

1855
01:27:08,701 --> 01:27:10,710
fucking creepy.
Coyotes.

1856
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:14,390
I told her I haven't seen any of those
things.

1857
01:27:14,391 --> 01:27:19,310
We've heard coyotes out there and the,
that's creepy when that happens,

1858
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:22,460
but you know they're like in the
distance.

1859
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:24,140
You just here.
Ooh,

1860
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:25,520
that's cool though,
right?

1861
01:27:25,521 --> 01:27:26,540
Yes.
Super Cool.

1862
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,570
It adds a real,
like you're almost like,

1863
01:27:29,571 --> 01:27:31,700
was that a human being fucking with us.
But

1864
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:35,140
do you know coyotes or wolves?
I don't know.

1865
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,990
They're wolves are small wolf.
Hmm.

1866
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:41,800
They're all in the same family.
I think that's how they make those coy

1867
01:27:41,801 --> 01:27:43,450
wolves.
They interbreed with each other back and

1868
01:27:43,451 --> 01:27:45,110
forth.
They're there.

1869
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:47,710
They make viable offspring to there now.
They don't make like,

1870
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:52,090
like some animals make a hybrid and the
hybrid can't give birth or can't get

1871
01:27:52,091 --> 01:27:54,160
pregnant or can't make another animal
pregnant.

1872
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:57,760
Not coyotes.
Coyotes can fuck dogs too.

1873
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,350
Wow.
So can walls,

1874
01:27:59,351 --> 01:28:01,690
will can fuck dogs.
It's really interesting.

1875
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:04,900
But what a coyote is,
is like when they first,

1876
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:08,090
when they first discovered coyotes and
uh,

1877
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,600
the,
the settlers arrived,

1878
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:14,620
they called them prairie wolves.
That was the first name for them before

1879
01:28:14,621 --> 01:28:17,460
they call them coyotes.
Variables.

1880
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:20,070
Yeah.
It's a lot kit or anything coyote.

1881
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:24,970
It's a lot more memorable.
But then the aztecs called them Kaiyote

1882
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:30,450
and then the Spanish called them Coyote
Otay and then that like there was a

1883
01:28:32,561 --> 01:28:36,940
Spanish pronunciation,
the Aztec name for coyotes prairie dog

1884
01:28:36,941 --> 01:28:38,170
and go for it.
And same thing.

1885
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,930
No,
no.

1886
01:28:40,931 --> 01:28:45,931
A prairie dog is different that I could
go for a golfer.

1887
01:28:46,841 --> 01:28:47,740
It's different

1888
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:52,910
prairie dogs at groundhog and Zoetis who
has those stupid

1889
01:28:55,150 --> 01:28:57,000
questions over overs are smaller
probably,

1890
01:28:57,001 --> 01:28:57,450
right?
Like,

1891
01:28:57,450 --> 01:28:58,500
yeah,
usually fuck up.

1892
01:28:58,501 --> 01:28:59,334
Like Garden.
Yeah,

1893
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:02,600
we have gophers.
I'll go first near my house still the

1894
01:29:02,601 --> 01:29:04,440
bigger,
I'll find like she's a little mounds of

1895
01:29:04,441 --> 01:29:06,540
dirt.
It's a little fuckers poked out through

1896
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:08,310
my lawn.
It's like weird.

1897
01:29:08,311 --> 01:29:09,810
It's like somebody just left a pile of
dirt,

1898
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:11,650
but it's really just a gopher pop
through.

1899
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:13,800
Does prairie dogs though,
man,

1900
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:17,850
they shoot the shit out of those things.
It's really kind of crazy because they,

1901
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:22,440
they're a real nuisance on cattle
ranches because they dig these holes and

1902
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:25,320
then cal step and then they snapped
their legs and it becomes a real

1903
01:29:25,321 --> 01:29:28,320
problem.
So they shoot him like crazy and so

1904
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:32,550
people will set up on these fields and
these high powered rifles with scopes

1905
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:34,140
and just waiting for this little
fuckers,

1906
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,140
talk to head of them.
Boom.

1907
01:29:37,141 --> 01:29:41,080
That sounds like fun.
Was video brock lesnar shooting a

1908
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:46,140
prairie dog with like some ungodly gun,
like a 50 caliber gun and he says hello.

1909
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:50,820
That's the kind of hunting I can get
into.

1910
01:29:50,821 --> 01:29:53,700
I could go out and be like the prairie
dog guy.

1911
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,010
That's your your new thing?
Yeah,

1912
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,290
prairie dog.
The prairie dog.

1913
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:00,000
Prairie dog.
The bounty hunter.

1914
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,980
I could see you going out hunting with
like a Bandana on a cruise.

1915
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:08,700
I got the lead singer of poison.
I can see you with like a prairie dog

1916
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:13,200
Bandana with like fake hair if you put
on like a wig,

1917
01:30:13,201 --> 01:30:15,390
fake longer hair.
Eh,

1918
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:19,350
he's dated a prairie dog out there that
are surrounding

1919
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:23,960
and then just get to go out.
He's supposed to meet people out there.

1920
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:26,570
They get,
they get out there a little early and

1921
01:30:26,571 --> 01:30:28,910
you don't expect them to,
you're out there fucking a dead prairie

1922
01:30:28,911 --> 01:30:31,660
dog.
Hey,

1923
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:34,400
Whoa,
we'll you let me know you're there.

1924
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,580
Eh,
we roles as a stone.

1925
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:43,620
Every prairie dog.

1926
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:45,920
Yeah,
you can,

1927
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,290
you can shoot nuisance animals.
Isn't that interesting?

1928
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:49,593
Like those,

1929
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:54,120
what's interesting is I was in her dog
and I was trying to figure out how to

1930
01:30:54,121 --> 01:30:56,710
work prairie dog and then it would take
somebody out and try to find somewhere

1931
01:30:56,711 --> 01:30:57,480
for them to shut up a

1932
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,900
public.
That'd be your show.

1933
01:30:59,290 --> 01:31:00,560
Yeah.
Prairie dog.

1934
01:31:00,561 --> 01:31:03,910
And that with Tony.
That's what I call prairie dog.

1935
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:07,240
There was a,
there's an animal called a ground

1936
01:31:07,241 --> 01:31:08,680
squirrel.
It was very different than a tree.

1937
01:31:08,681 --> 01:31:10,470
Squirrel and ground squirrels.
You,

1938
01:31:10,471 --> 01:31:13,300
he can't eat them.
Tree squirrels apparently are very good.

1939
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,800
They taste good.
I've actually eating them.

1940
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:17,410
I shouldn't say apparently of actually
eating them.

1941
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,720
They taste good.
It's a weird little animal.

1942
01:31:19,721 --> 01:31:20,990
But,
um,

1943
01:31:21,190 --> 01:31:26,190
ground squirrels are so common in some
places like to home ranch is 270,000

1944
01:31:28,481 --> 01:31:32,620
acres is huge ranch in California.
It has cows,

1945
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:35,230
it has bears,
mountain lions,

1946
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:36,790
deer,
elk,

1947
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:42,690
Turkey.
There is more biomass in prairie dogs

1948
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:46,630
that all those other animals,
there's so many fun,

1949
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,410
not prairie dogs,
ground squirrels,

1950
01:31:48,610 --> 01:31:51,670
there's more so many fucking ground
squirrels.

1951
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:53,560
So like when the guy was telling me
that,

1952
01:31:53,561 --> 01:31:54,394
I was like,
wow,

1953
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:55,570
are you serious?
He goes,

1954
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,050
if you weighed all of the ground
squirrels on his,

1955
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:00,130
he would weigh

1956
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:04,390
as much as everything else combined.
Like how is that possible?

1957
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,340
So,
so then we're driving down the road,

1958
01:32:06,341 --> 01:32:08,050
he's like,
just pay attention and watch 'em off.

1959
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:09,940
And so as we're driving down the road
and you see them,

1960
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:13,130
like as they hear the car coming,
they've jumped out of their holes and

1961
01:32:13,131 --> 01:32:16,000
scatter and run to another whole jump
out of the whole scatter.

1962
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:18,250
And you're seeing them all over the
place,

1963
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:19,480
like 20,
30,

1964
01:32:19,481 --> 01:32:21,910
40 in,
in your immediate vision,

1965
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:25,180
just popping out of holes are running.
There's dig a little holes in the

1966
01:32:25,181 --> 01:32:26,220
ground.
Dive into them.

1967
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:28,243
Creepy.

1968
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:29,810
Yeah.
So they go out there and try to kill

1969
01:32:29,811 --> 01:32:32,570
them.
But you only see them for like a half a

1970
01:32:32,571 --> 01:32:34,850
second.
Like you barely can get a shot off a

1971
01:32:34,851 --> 01:32:36,530
good day.
You killed like two or three of them.

1972
01:32:36,531 --> 01:32:39,780
But this fucking thousands of them just
running around.

1973
01:32:40,110 --> 01:32:42,600
Well it was doing anything.
So there's a hanging on underground.

1974
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:45,690
Well they spread diseases according to
this guy.

1975
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:48,900
He's like certain Mites.
Mites become a real issue.

1976
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:52,620
Apparently Mites are real.
I found out about [inaudible] Mites when

1977
01:32:52,621 --> 01:32:57,621
I was in Nevada are telling me you you
can't handle a jackrabbit.

1978
01:32:58,530 --> 01:33:01,980
Like if you shoot a Jack Rabbit and
handle it and if you don't have gloves

1979
01:33:01,981 --> 01:33:04,470
on,
you can get these mites on you and they

1980
01:33:04,471 --> 01:33:07,380
can give you a serious bacterial
infection that you got to need

1981
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:10,860
antibiotics for.
It's like it's seriously dangerous and

1982
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,580
people have died from it.
People have gotten that bacterial

1983
01:33:14,581 --> 01:33:18,900
infection not going to treat it and
fucking died from mites.

1984
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:21,690
Oh rabbit.
That's crazy.

1985
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:23,610
Yeah,
man.

1986
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:29,990
More useless facts.
That was crazy.

1987
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,000
No diseases on any animals and then
nuts.

1988
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:35,060
Yeah,
no salmon knows.

1989
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,680
At least that's why.
What's his face?

1990
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:39,720
Jai depth.
Got In trouble bringing his dog over

1991
01:33:39,721 --> 01:33:40,710
there.
Hey,

1992
01:33:40,711 --> 01:33:42,970
fuck it.
Yeah.

1993
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,890
Australia,
China depth.

1994
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:47,100
Trying to ruin the party over there.
God Damn.

1995
01:33:47,101 --> 01:33:47,630
Piece of shit.

1996
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:50,150
That's a funny show.
Do you watch that on Netflix at all?

1997
01:33:50,151 --> 01:33:51,950
Australian border security.

1998
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:53,490
Yeah.

1999
01:33:53,490 --> 01:33:58,490
Great show.
Our TSA is boring as fuck and we don't

2000
01:33:59,491 --> 01:34:04,350
film stuff like I for some reason our
government doesn't care to make money

2001
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:05,670
like that.
You know what I mean?

2002
01:34:05,671 --> 01:34:07,480
Like make a production out of it.
Right.

2003
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:11,640
But Australia is like fuck it.
And pretty much they just get all these

2004
01:34:11,641 --> 01:34:14,790
people coming in from America,
Chai and I Canada,

2005
01:34:14,791 --> 01:34:17,250
your plane lands,
you're going through Tsa.

2006
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:20,100
They just start fucking like check out
this guy right here.

2007
01:34:20,101 --> 01:34:21,750
He's acting on a little suspicious.
Right.

2008
01:34:21,751 --> 01:34:23,070
And then they'd come through and they're
like,

2009
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,200
why are you suspicious?
And he's like,

2010
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:27,180
nothing suspicious.
What's going on?

2011
01:34:27,181 --> 01:34:28,920
And like it just like,
you know,

2012
01:34:28,921 --> 01:34:30,690
then they ended up finding that,
you know,

2013
01:34:30,691 --> 01:34:33,360
they show you the suitcase x ray and
they were like,

2014
01:34:33,361 --> 01:34:36,000
this seems to be a little something
here.

2015
01:34:36,001 --> 01:34:38,820
And then maybe we want to tell us what's
in your suitcase.

2016
01:34:38,821 --> 01:34:40,620
Is there anything else thing they're
always like,

2017
01:34:40,621 --> 01:34:43,200
no.
And then you know they find cocaine or

2018
01:34:43,201 --> 01:34:46,770
something like that and it's like
they're smuggling it in from wherever

2019
01:34:46,771 --> 01:34:50,160
and they're just busted and they show
you right at the end.

2020
01:34:50,161 --> 01:34:54,000
Like he got sentenced to 20 years in
Australian prison.

2021
01:34:54,001 --> 01:34:56,820
Like he just landed there and then it's
been good.

2022
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,220
Hello,

2023
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:02,900
welcome and good bye done.
When you go to a place like that,

2024
01:35:02,901 --> 01:35:05,630
do you give up your rights?
So he filmed a cause that work or do

2025
01:35:05,631 --> 01:35:08,530
they like to say,
I really don't think it's,

2026
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,690
you're in their country,
it's not.

2027
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:11,240
And I like to know you're not an
American.

2028
01:35:11,241 --> 01:35:14,000
I rated for roles.
I really don't think they give a fuck.

2029
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:15,710
I think they wrote their roles around
like,

2030
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:17,990
hey,
if you don't want to get caught bringing

2031
01:35:17,991 --> 01:35:22,850
drugs and then follow the rules while
they're really rough on immigrants,

2032
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:27,950
have you come there illegally and you
don't get a chance to like settle down

2033
01:35:27,951 --> 01:35:30,620
and made your case.
They put you on a fucking boat and they

2034
01:35:30,621 --> 01:35:33,290
sent me to an island number of jobs is
apps just talking about it.

2035
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:35,990
He's like,
it's really kind of fucked up like what

2036
01:35:35,991 --> 01:35:37,970
they do,
but they have a very strict anti

2037
01:35:37,971 --> 01:35:42,110
immigration policy like illegal
immigrants do not get treated with any

2038
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:43,330
respect.
It's like what?

2039
01:35:43,331 --> 01:35:47,450
What trump was talking about pales in
comparison to what they do on a daily

2040
01:35:47,451 --> 01:35:52,070
basis in Australia and Australia,
which seems to be like a place that's

2041
01:35:52,071 --> 01:35:54,440
really killing it right now and doing
really good.

2042
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:56,990
They're doing really well.
There are economies super strong.

2043
01:35:57,020 --> 01:36:00,020
There's only 20 million of them in a
country the size of the United States.

2044
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:02,040
How many were you up here?

2045
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:05,000
We have 30 million in California.
Oh,

2046
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:10,060
we have 330 million in the country,
so we have 310 million more people than

2047
01:36:11,241 --> 01:36:14,870
they have in the same size.
Kind of like half as many people.

2048
01:36:14,871 --> 01:36:17,720
I'll show you just in Ohio,
but then it put it in perspective.

2049
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,620
I think we need a new car selves.
It's my,

2050
01:36:21,621 --> 01:36:22,820
no,
I put it in perspective.

2051
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:26,780
India.
I think India is a third the size of the

2052
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:27,614
United States.

2053
01:36:28,290 --> 01:36:30,760
It's got like a billion people one
point.

2054
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:33,830
Oh yeah.
Is that how small it is?

2055
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:35,480
You know,
they make it so when you look at a map,

2056
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:37,850
they make a lot of kids.
But it's another thing on that too.

2057
01:36:37,851 --> 01:36:40,040
Sorry.
More questions for us.

2058
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:44,720
The Brazil is a gauge drawn the size of
Brazil's Rome on a map.

2059
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:46,610
Oh yeah.
It's way bigger than [inaudible]

2060
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:48,980
perceived like Africa.
Oh yeah.

2061
01:36:48,981 --> 01:36:51,290
Afternoon.
Wade bowling perceived Brazil itself is

2062
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:53,030
also way bigger than it looks like on
that.

2063
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:57,480
How big is India and compares?
What do you guess?

2064
01:36:57,481 --> 01:37:00,510
I'm guessing the third.
I'd say slight.

2065
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:04,110
No bigger than like Texas plus a couple
of surrounding states.

2066
01:37:04,290 --> 01:37:06,370
So that's close to 30.
Really?

2067
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:09,850
I think it's like half his big.
I don't think it is.

2068
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,890
All right.
Let's see.

2069
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:14,620
How big is India?
Any comparison?

2070
01:37:19,570 --> 01:37:21,610
Why don't you guys talk while,
you know,

2071
01:37:21,611 --> 01:37:24,270
Indians have a lot of kids,
but I never see a,

2072
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:25,930
uh,
Indian porn.

2073
01:37:26,910 --> 01:37:28,030
Oh,
you got to look for it.

2074
01:37:28,450 --> 01:37:29,890
I mean,
I've seen it a couple of times.

2075
01:37:29,891 --> 01:37:32,710
The important stars.
Mia,

2076
01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:38,210
she's uh,
she's era brand.

2077
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:43,300
She does like,
like isis porn or something like that

2078
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:47,260
that he said had shot the job.
Something like that and gets down.

2079
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:49,480
Yeah.
She does.

2080
01:37:49,540 --> 01:37:53,860
Slightly more than one third of the U s
nailed it.

2081
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:56,190
How'd you find that quick?
I just typed

2082
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:59,160
in India compared to the u s oh yeah.
Things come up right there.

2083
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:01,020
I just got it.
Yeah.

2084
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:04,410
That was pretty crazy.
Amazing.

2085
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:09,090
And a billion people.
So compared to Australia,

2086
01:38:09,470 --> 01:38:10,600
you know,
I mean,

2087
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:15,620
think about Australia is three times
larger than India and India has a funk

2088
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:21,500
and million people in it.
Those are perceived.

2089
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:24,540
That's what's crazy is in India,
I'm pretty straight.

2090
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:27,720
You can go anywhere and pour it on your
pants and take an emergency shit.

2091
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,550
You can where people do it.
Yeah.

2092
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:32,310
Well our city saw people doing China.
Wow.

2093
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:33,920
Some people just pull over and start to
share.

2094
01:38:33,921 --> 01:38:37,290
It's the size of Brazil compared to the
u s and so unless the same size.

2095
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:39,510
Wow.
Yeah.

2096
01:38:39,511 --> 01:38:44,000
It's real close to Indiana top.
I'm 30 shirts.

2097
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:45,540
Brazil.
Wow,

2098
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:46,830
that's crazy.
Well,

2099
01:38:46,831 --> 01:38:49,890
Africa's the nuttiest one.
When you see African comparison to the

2100
01:38:49,891 --> 01:38:51,210
United States,
you know?

2101
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,940
Wow.
Like you could fit everything in there.

2102
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,700
You could fit America,
fit China,

2103
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:59,220
you fit Asia,
you could fit Europe.

2104
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:02,400
Yeah.
I mean Africa is fucking big man.

2105
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:05,490
Whoa,
whoa.

2106
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,860
Exactly right.
Wow.

2107
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:11,910
It's bigger and blacker and everything
started there.

2108
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,000
That's what's bizarre.
It's all from there.

2109
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:15,360
Chris Rock special,
right?

2110
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:18,270
Bigger and blacker.
Best word.

2111
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,610
No,
that was a no,

2112
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:22,410
I'm not thinking bigger and blacker.
I'm thinking the one he went to Africa

2113
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:26,310
and did stand up when you had that one
is that one whack me out.

2114
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:30,870
Skip changing clothes like I didn't
understand why that was a good idea.

2115
01:39:30,871 --> 01:39:34,170
I like this definitely cutting edge at
the time,

2116
01:39:34,171 --> 01:39:35,880
but I don't know.
No benefited.

2117
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:38,160
I don't think it was,
I just think it was just a bunch of

2118
01:39:38,161 --> 01:39:39,690
shows put together,
showing off.

2119
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:42,870
You're in a bunch of different places,
but it also it,

2120
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:45,240
it releases the veil.

2121
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:47,510
It pulls aside the veil or the same
thing.

2122
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:52,470
The same set up punchline every night.
Like that's like the hidden sort of

2123
01:39:52,471 --> 01:39:55,110
subtext to it.
You're letting everyone know like this

2124
01:39:55,111 --> 01:39:56,730
is like,
he does it the exact same way.

2125
01:39:56,731 --> 01:40:00,330
It sort of exposes a little bit of the
magic of what he's doing.

2126
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:01,680
You know,
great comic.

2127
01:40:01,681 --> 01:40:06,681
Like Chris Rock is so smooth on stage.
You get caught up in this,

2128
01:40:07,561 --> 01:40:10,950
like you don't thinking that this is a
well prepared,

2129
01:40:10,951 --> 01:40:12,930
well-written,
well-rehearsed bit.

2130
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:17,010
You're just laughing at the idea.
But when you see him perform the set up

2131
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:18,130
in one place,
the punchline,

2132
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:20,490
the other,
then you're forced to sort of

2133
01:40:20,491 --> 01:40:21,540
internalize like,
oh,

2134
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:24,900
he does this the exact same way
everywhere he goes.

2135
01:40:24,901 --> 01:40:28,320
He said it a hundred times four.
It's almost like seeing it twice in some

2136
01:40:28,321 --> 01:40:29,370
sort of a way.
We,

2137
01:40:29,371 --> 01:40:33,030
you see someone who's really funny and
then you see them again do the same bit.

2138
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:36,150
It's not as good.
It's like even if you really love them,

2139
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:39,000
it's a little less good,
you know?

2140
01:40:39,001 --> 01:40:42,620
And so he kind of had that in a special
kind of built in.

2141
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:45,000
It's still great,
you know,

2142
01:40:45,001 --> 01:40:48,840
but not in my mind,
not as good.

2143
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:52,800
But that's one of those things where you
just keep trying to do something weird.

2144
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:54,190
Yeah.
Yeah,

2145
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:59,170
keep trying to mix it up like,
like if you did your whole special like

2146
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:01,960
from the beginning to the end with one
camera,

2147
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,470
like you showed up and found the whole
thing is just kind of

2148
01:41:04,730 --> 01:41:08,030
genius idea.
One shot on Netflix,

2149
01:41:08,210 --> 01:41:12,200
Tony Hinchcliffe go see it now.
Are you doing another one in October and

2150
01:41:12,201 --> 01:41:13,880
he decided I'm not,
you know,

2151
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:15,670
I'm not going to,
do you want to do what your next one?

2152
01:41:15,870 --> 01:41:18,170
I don't know.
I'm going to wait to see when somebody

2153
01:41:18,171 --> 01:41:22,200
comes at me with an idea or something
like that and I dunno.

2154
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:23,450
We'll see.
Then again,

2155
01:41:23,451 --> 01:41:26,660
if nobody comes at me soon,
maybe I'll just make another one at some

2156
01:41:26,661 --> 01:41:29,330
point.
You made yours and then you sold it to

2157
01:41:29,331 --> 01:41:30,011
Netflix,
which is,

2158
01:41:30,011 --> 01:41:32,870
yeah,
I feel like what I did with the Ice

2159
01:41:32,870 --> 01:41:34,910
House,
I can pretty much pitch that to anybody

2160
01:41:34,911 --> 01:41:36,410
in the,
I think they'd be down,

2161
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:40,040
you know?
It was a pretty cool deal so,

2162
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,740
well it's also shawn,
this was the way you did it.

2163
01:41:42,741 --> 01:41:46,310
It's like you really get the sense of
the intimacy of a comedy club,

2164
01:41:46,311 --> 01:41:50,900
which I think still is the best venue
for a special,

2165
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:52,040
you know,
cause you're like,

2166
01:41:52,490 --> 01:41:53,300
you know,
you're in,

2167
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:55,550
in your,
where you're watching television at

2168
01:41:55,551 --> 01:41:56,810
home,
you're in your living room,

2169
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:59,270
you're sitting on a couch just like that
usually.

2170
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:02,390
So like stand up should be in a small
room,

2171
01:42:02,690 --> 01:42:03,460
you know?
Yeah.

2172
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:04,293
The club,

2173
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:05,570
it's,
it's so cool.

2174
01:42:05,571 --> 01:42:07,430
When I did the Ice House with you last
week,

2175
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:10,840
Sean Sullivan,
the GM there came up to me and uh,

2176
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:13,400
we were talking a little bit about it
and he goes,

2177
01:42:13,401 --> 01:42:15,800
man,
there's people that come to this spot

2178
01:42:15,801 --> 01:42:17,930
right next to the parking spot here.
And they even,

2179
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:19,850
they checked with the employees and us,
they got,

2180
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:23,330
isn't that the spot where Tony starts
and then he goes in and then he comes

2181
01:42:23,331 --> 01:42:24,400
back there?
Yeah.

2182
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:27,380
So it's sort of like his like opened up
there,

2183
01:42:27,381 --> 01:42:28,041
sir.
You know,

2184
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:29,840
it's sort of like a,
a cool spot.

2185
01:42:29,841 --> 01:42:32,750
Like I guess like when you see that
bullet hole in the back of the belly

2186
01:42:32,751 --> 01:42:34,380
room sign,
like kinnisons thing.

2187
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:36,230
Yeah.
It's like there's like a little bit of a

2188
01:42:36,770 --> 01:42:38,660
language.
They never fixed that sign.

2189
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:41,570
They,
they're trying to fix too many things.

2190
01:42:41,571 --> 01:42:45,530
They're trying to fix the patio floor
now and just see that debacle.

2191
01:42:45,531 --> 01:42:47,210
But next,
not shiny now.

2192
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,860
It was shining.
It was cool.

2193
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:49,790
Was about to slip.
I was like,

2194
01:42:49,791 --> 01:42:51,710
what?
And then they sanded it down.

2195
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,510
It looks like it's bad.

2196
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:56,610
Why would they fix the bullet hole?
The Sam Kennison putting that sign.

2197
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,360
That's like history.
I have to keep that sign.

2198
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,810
It makes half to one the one that they
fix the hole.

2199
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,170
The hole.
Right.

2200
01:43:04,170 --> 01:43:05,190
Okay.
I hope so.

2201
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:09,510
I hope they had to throw it out.
It makes zero sense to fix that.

2202
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:11,370
It still has the bullet hole in the
back.

2203
01:43:12,210 --> 01:43:13,043
Oh,

2204
01:43:13,190 --> 01:43:16,370
just doesn't have it through the glass.
The plastic part was lit up.

2205
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:18,620
Oh,
I didn't know that was a thing.

2206
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,500
Yeah,
he shot right to the fucking thing.

2207
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:23,380
Really?
What a crazy little cane.

2208
01:43:23,381 --> 01:43:26,330
Steph an asshole.
Is there a good question back by the

2209
01:43:26,331 --> 01:43:27,610
size?
Someone pointed it out there again.

2210
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:29,240
I was like,
I didn't know there was one year or two

2211
01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:33,770
probably.
I mean if he shot a 38 at close range is

2212
01:43:33,771 --> 01:43:35,210
I believe that's what everybody said it
was.

2213
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:37,640
Who would definitely go through that and
into the wall.

2214
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:44,500
By the way,
the photo for the cover of one shot shot

2215
01:43:44,501 --> 01:43:45,130
by

2216
01:43:45,130 --> 01:43:47,770
Jamie Vernon.
Vernon.

2217
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:50,350
Yes.
Accidentally got cut out of the credit

2218
01:43:50,610 --> 01:43:52,580
though.
Steve was there literally

2219
01:43:52,580 --> 01:43:55,130
in there and then he literally wasn't
after that.

2220
01:43:56,600 --> 01:44:01,600
It's just a complete technical layer
from the person who was on my first non

2221
01:44:02,211 --> 01:44:03,640
credit.
It won't be my last,

2222
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:06,560
these motherfuckers in non credits.
God dammit.

2223
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:09,740
I'm done talking.
I'm the king of a non credit.

2224
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:12,500
We can uh,
we can continue this tomorrow.

2225
01:44:12,501 --> 01:44:15,260
I have to show or it can just,
we can edit it on this too.

2226
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:20,380
It could be like make a part to a denim.
Maybe I'll just turn it on and see if

2227
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:22,400
there's anything fun or something like
that.

2228
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:23,511
Yeah,
why not?

2229
01:44:23,511 --> 01:44:24,770
Fuck it.
Um,

2230
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,300
yeah,
we'll just put it on the green room.

2231
01:44:26,570 --> 01:44:30,680
Talk some shit.
So this podcast for now is over,

2232
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:33,300
but I'm,
so we did like a couple hours and it's

2233
01:44:33,301 --> 01:44:36,250
an hour and a half hour.
40 good.

2234
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:40,310
Plenty of time,
and so we're doing a west side barbell.

2235
01:44:40,311 --> 01:44:43,370
Tomorrow we're going to be meeting up
with Louie Simmons,

2236
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:48,550
who's the famous a power lifter and a
strength coach of Westside barbell.

2237
01:44:49,011 --> 01:44:51,020
You want to go Tony,
who give you some fucking pointers?

2238
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:56,590
I get jacked powerlifting and me.
We really don't see eye to eye live with

2239
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:58,600
me.
I'm getting bigger,

2240
01:44:58,610 --> 01:45:02,660
but I'm just send the bag right now.
What average dude?

2241
01:45:02,661 --> 01:45:04,530
I've been lifting Omari.
I'm,

2242
01:45:04,690 --> 01:45:06,740
I already looked pretty much better than
you.

2243
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:11,210
It's been like three months.
I told him I think he's a little bigger

2244
01:45:11,211 --> 01:45:12,530
than you.
All right.

2245
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,450
Well,
Jamie does dead lifts and tomorrow's

2246
01:45:14,451 --> 01:45:18,020
podcast.
We're going shirt with a jacked and gets

2247
01:45:18,021 --> 01:45:18,854
down there.

2248
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:23,550
We're going to have,
we're going to let the audience to send

2249
01:45:23,551 --> 01:45:25,750
it tomorrow night life and just how the
fuck her.

2250
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:30,600
Let's just get arrested.
Who can hold that shit in the longest?

2251
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:34,300
Let's have a contest.
All right.

2252
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:36,150
We're going to wrap this thing,
so goodnight.

2253
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:37,040
Bye.
Fuck you right.
