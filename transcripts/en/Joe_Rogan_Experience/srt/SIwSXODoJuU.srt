1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,930
Doon doon,
Doon Doon,

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,100
Doon Doon doon teaching dunk in the ways
of windows laptop.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,000
Fucking love it.
Max Keyboards can go fuck themselves.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,630
Those are terrible keyboards.
They're not designed for comfort and 

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,831
writing.
This whole idea of getting thinner man 

6
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:27,591
get thinner and thinner.
So it's a piece of paper and it 

7
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:29,320
magically unfolds that expanse the right
side.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,180
This is fucking.
This is not too thick.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,860
Yeah.
How come they can do it?

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,360
Well,
how come you guys can't do it?

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,570
Why?
How come you only offer one shitty ass 

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,671
fucking keyboard?
Find out if your map will qualify for 

13
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:43,740
apples.
Keyboard repair program.

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,840
I don't want you to repair the same 
shitty keyboard.

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,690
I want you to make a real keyboard where
you have like,

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,050
it's got like a little bit of a u shape 
to it.

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,120
Where you finger that goes into the 
center.

18
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,920
What does that call?
How do they describe that?

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,730
And the keys have like a little,
a little bit of a dip to them.

20
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:02,400
And then in the middle you feel where 
they are?

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,090
Yeah.
Dimpled.

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Perhaps you feel where they are.
They have travel so your fingers know 

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,380
what's going on.
You get tactile feedback,

24
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:13,650
more tactile feedback.
Then this little clickety click thing,

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,770
which might as well be.
You might as well be doing it on an 

26
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,090
ipad.
You know you have an ipad keyboard and 

27
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,550
it kind of works,
but it kind of doesn't because your 

28
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,550
fingers are all feeling the same thing 
every time.

29
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,380
One individual buttons and give you 
individual feedback so you don't have to

30
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,900
think about what's happening.
You could just think about the words.

31
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,510
It feels like this.
They hired an alien at apple that forgot

32
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,180
that.
Humans like to push buttons.

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,310
We like it.
It feels good.

34
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:41,810
It feels good though.
They're.

35
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:45,650
They're ignoring like a basic human 
drake,

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,020
which is like,
have you seen those dumb cubes?

37
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:53,021
Nervous people get.
They've got like buttons and Shit and 

38
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:53,720
you spin it around.
It's the same thing.

39
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:58,721
It's like gives you this tactile little 
thing where you take all that extra 

40
00:01:58,721 --> 00:01:59,990
energy and you put it in your.
In your stress ball.

41
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,580
Your people liked it.
Punch,

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,610
impress and click and switch and that's 
what apple forgot.

43
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,770
It's like when I'm typing man,
I like that.

44
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,730
I like like in the shining.
When you hear that means I'm typing.

45
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,760
I like the sound,
the flutter of the keys as you're 

46
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,070
writing that fucking apple keyboard.
Man.

47
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,810
When I went in I was so ready to buy a 
brand new Mac book pro,

48
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:30,420
so excited.
Really excited like five minds from like

49
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,300
2014 or 2015.
I mean,

50
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,680
not to like be in fucking apple fanboy,
but I will say that when I,

51
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,730
when I went in there with it instead of 
trying to sell me the new Mac book,

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,070
she looked at it and was like,
what are you doing on the thing?

53
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:49,520
And I'm like,
oh,

54
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:51,740
I edit sound.
And she was like,

55
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,180
Ma,
I don't know that you,

56
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,300
that you even need a new and outside of 
the fact that it's new.

57
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,770
Whoever you are,
young lady

58
00:02:59,710 --> 00:02:59,990
Odin

59
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,270
blesses you and blesses you and blesses 
you for your,

60
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,620
your,
your truth.

61
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

62
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,930
It was for your wisdom,

63
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,650
dude.
I was so shocked.

64
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,310
I always tell them to eat.
We don't need the computing power.

65
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,710
I was stunned,
man,

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,760
because like I've never in that,
that moment is kind of made me 

67
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,200
perpetually love apple because they're 
training their employees not to like,

68
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,270
just like pressure sell shit,
but just to actually help the customer 

69
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,560
out of stock.
She could sell you one.

70
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:30,700
Anyway,
she was just like,

71
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,100
dude,
you don't even want one.

72
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,410
She's probably quitting.
She's quitting.

73
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:37,360
Just sick of her job for the last four 
days.

74
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:39,760
She's been telling everyone no matter 
what they came in to buy it.

75
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,270
She's like,
you know,

76
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:45,271
you don't need this.
Her boss has been saying creepy shit to 

77
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:45,271
her.
She's been ready to quit for a while.

78
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,810
I was an asshole.
Yeah,

79
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,350
yeah.
No.

80
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,010
Okay.
Mark.

81
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,310
Okay.
I'm going to go out in the floor and 

82
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,591
Mark Jessica,
I've noticed your sales have gone to 

83
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:54,591
zero.

84
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:55,140
Okay.
Move those new laptops.

85
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:55,470
Well,
yeah,

86
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,290
he sure.
Mark.

87
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,750
Mark's got a creepy wink.
Yeah.

88
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,930
Can you get away with that at work?
What can you do now?

89
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,610
What if you're like,
hey,

90
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:10,611
susie,
make sure you have that copy done to 

91
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:12,090
personnel by two.
No,

92
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,330
can't do that.
You can't wink and go,

93
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,650
hey,
you definitely can't do the gun.

94
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,740
Nope.
Unless you're doing it to everybody.

95
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,830
If you're in a meeting,
you could go pet.

96
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,100
You're a mass shooter.
Oh,

97
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,650
I can't do it to one person,
to a group of people.

98
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:31,380
You can't make the finger gun anymore.
The finger guns gone.

99
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,520
You can't do I,
I,

100
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,330
you know,
I'm,

101
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,210
we're both.
We have cool jobs due to like,

102
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,120
I have to imagine that that's gone.
Like you know,

103
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:41,470
my house,
the finger guns,

104
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:46,471
not guns.
That guy shoot my dogs every day in 

105
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:49,651
front of my wife.
I like looking at her cavaliers and 

106
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:49,651
being like,
Bam,

107
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:50,440
Bam.
Now what?

108
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,490
Now what?

109
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,010
I can't even play around.
I love those done.

110
00:04:56,011 --> 00:05:01,011
It's like there's no room for new ones 
because there are crazy people to do 

111
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:04,611
shoot people.
You can't pretend to shoot people 

112
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:04,611
anymore.

113
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:04,611
Dude,
this is it man.

114
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:09,150
This is exactly the fucking problem of 
being interconnected by technology is 

115
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:14,641
that we are paying for the sins of the,
of the small percentile of absolute dumb

116
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:20,490
ass is on the planet.
And because of that there,

117
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,760
you know,
you know,

118
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:26,761
anytime I look at a sign,
any sign that's got like an obvious 

119
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:26,761
thing in it,
don't,

120
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,220
don't shed in the hot tub or like on the
roller coaster,

121
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,050
don't,
don't get out of your seat.

122
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,290
When I look at that,
I think that's because a dumb,

123
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,460
dumb dumb because there might be a 
person who's in the roller coaster,

124
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,220
like,
will be more fun.

125
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,070
Didn't do it mean to do a southern 
accent.

126
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:48,000
By the way,
I'm from the south.

127
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:48,870
I don't think they're all done.

128
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,530
This is too many people dogging.
There's too many people talking in this 

129
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,320
world.
Didn't use to be like that.

130
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:58,190
This is a new thing

131
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,940
for the last 10 years.
People started talking.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,250
Yeah.
Nope.

133
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,050
The,
the average person didn't ever voiced 20

134
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:11,051
years ago.
There's great things to anyone having a 

135
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:11,480
voice crate thing.
Great,

136
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,320
great things.
But we're going to have to relearn human

137
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:16,690
communication,
right?

138
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,960
We can't use the old rules for today.
It just can't work.

139
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,010
He can't work and it's too easy to be an
asshole.

140
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,820
People got to stop seeking that out.
Like I the lashing out at people for no 

141
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:36,140
reason.
It's so crazy how many people do it.

142
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:38,270
You'll see someone post something and 
someone will be like,

143
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,760
fuck you.
You dumb piece of shit.

144
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:44,450
Don't you realize that this is why this 
and why that any.

145
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,250
You know,
Steven Kotler,

146
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:49,540
he's been on this show a few times.
He's awesome and they're doing these,

147
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,760
doing this new psychedelic study,
psychedelics and flow states.

148
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,710
So I retweeted a tweet because he,
he's like,

149
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,920
they're doing research right now.

150
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,060
They need people to fill out a survey.
So I retweeted that to help steven out.

151
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,150
Just like,
ah,

152
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,740
cool.
Yeah,

153
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:08,741
that's a cool thing.
I think psychedelics probably do induce 

154
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:09,200
flow states.
I'd like to find out for sure,

155
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,380
but within like six comments,
it's still up there if y'all want to 

156
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,091
look.
Some dude wrote to me something on the 

157
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:21,971
lines of like,
you're hurting people and don't even 

158
00:07:21,971 --> 00:07:22,670
know it.
That six down.

159
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,380
It's like hurting people.
I can't remember what language he used,

160
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:27,890
but it's like,
what the fuck you.

161
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,650
This is a survey dude.
Like what are you talking about?

162
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,050
Like is it maybe he means by re tweeting
surveys,

163
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,990
that sucks because no one wants to see 
that on their timeline,

164
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:40,991
but I think he meant you're hurting 
people by demystifying and de 

165
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:47,231
stigmatizing psychedelics.
Little do you know you're fighting cruel

166
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:51,050
funding.
Funding cruelty.

167
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,060
I'll locally just said,
huh?

168
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,580
Because I want the explanation because 
it's like when someone says something 

169
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,721
like that,
it's so terribly absolutely impossibly 

170
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:04,700
wrong from my reality tunnel that it's 
like I want to get narrow reality tunnel

171
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:09,110
and here because that guy really that he
believes it well or he's a troll.

172
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,680
It could be he's a troll.
It could be that each had terrible 

173
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,670
experiences with psychedelics.
That's,

174
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,790
you know,
maybe he's one of those guys that had a 

175
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:21,790
real,
you know,

176
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,560
look,
when people get really into something,

177
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,580
they want everybody to get into it.
I'm a terrible example that I'm telling 

178
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:28,580
everybody.
Got Into Yoga,

179
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:28,580
Yoga,
do yoga.

180
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,290
Yeah.
This happens with,

181
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,920
with everything.
Oh,

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and people that get sober,
like people that have a real problem to 

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,371
have.
Like we all know someone who's gone off 

184
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:42,371
the deep end with drugs,
right?

185
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:46,990
When they come out of that,
some folks turned into evangelists for 

186
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,250
sobriety.
Yeah,

187
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,270
and it gets super annoying.
Yeah.

188
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,400
One of the things they do is they 
demonize all positive experiences that 

189
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,070
we're with the

190
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,050
same substances,
their negative experience,

191
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,140
and they're fucking crazy head.
They've decided because they had a bad 

192
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,810
trip.
Every trip is bad.

193
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,080
The millions of people tripping all over
the world,

194
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,260
taking mushrooms,
finding God and love and companionship 

195
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,090
and harmony with the universe and an 
acceptance of their mortality.

196
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,420
All that doesn't count because billy 
couldn't keep his shit together at the 

197
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,110
pink Floyd concert because this fucking 
asshole decided to eat the entire,

198
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,680
the entire bag of mushrooms and he 
tripped his balls off and was screaming.

199
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:33,681
They had to take her to the hospital any
and he called his ex girlfriend and 

200
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:36,000
cried to her for hours and now her 
boyfriend,

201
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:38,760
a new boyfriend wants to beat him up and
he doesn't even remember doing it.

202
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,140
Like,
that guy guy's an idiot.

203
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,650
Okay.
There's a lot of those people out there.

204
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:47,651
All lot of them,
a whole lot of them and there's people 

205
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:49,040
that just aren't geared for psychedelics
for whatever reason.

206
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,570
You know,
there's people that are really,

207
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,410
really close to losing their shit with 
regular reality.

208
00:09:54,411 --> 00:09:56,750
For sure.
For them it's not a good idea.

209
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,640
It's not a good idea.
Absolutely.

210
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,400
That's definitely something that like in
my old age,

211
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,940
I want to put in like at Tallix and 
underlying.

212
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:08,340
That's what you just said because when I
was younger,

213
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,610
when you're younger and you are in that 
evangelical part of your psychedelic 

214
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,920
life,
you can become like,

215
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:21,010
if you're not careful,
ridiculous and irresponsible and you 

216
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,491
start throwing out there this like idea 
that is not only fundamentally wrong,

217
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:31,230
it's fundamentally wrong in everything 
as far as I'm concerned,

218
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,770
which is there's not really a one cure 
to your troubles.

219
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:35,790
You know what I mean?
So,

220
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,970
but with psychedelics,
people think this is the answer,

221
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,950
this is the answer,
this is it,

222
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,300
this is what we need.
And it's like,

223
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:45,030
well,
it's part of what some people need,

224
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,150
but if you've got manic depression,
for example,

225
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,940
if you've got bipolar,
you know,

226
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,600
dude,
I had this moment where this,

227
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,040
uh,
some parents came up to me and were dead

228
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,990
tell you about this there.

229
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:03,030
They came in to talk to me.
I'm at a show and they were like talking

230
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:06,450
about how their kid,
like my podcast.

231
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:12,140
And it was really sad because he had 
been at one of my podcasts and I think 

232
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,040
he'd come onstage as a question or 
something or,

233
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,440
and they were looking for a recording of
the live show because they thought maybe

234
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:23,250
they could hear him talk or get some,
like as in laughter or something.

235
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,040
But anyway,
what happened was he,

236
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,810
uh,
I think he had some kind of.

237
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:31,140
I'm bipolar,
I'm not sure what,

238
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:33,530
but he's one of my friends rave and he's
like,

239
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,020
is he uses the term gyro is gyro is off 
a little bit,

240
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,460
you know,
something was off a little bit.

241
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,910
But anyway,
the kid went and did Iowaska in Peru.

242
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:49,120
He did a eight night or wanting to know 
how they're doing these.

243
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,060
I don't know how they do it every night 
or every other night,

244
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,160
eight retreat,
drinking

245
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,160
the medicine every night and then after 
that went to some kind of like other 

246
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:02,890
shaman or some woman,
I don't know who it was,

247
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:07,891
I'm not sure of the dates,
but then he came home and he jumped off 

248
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:12,991
a waterfall and killed himself because,
because what had happened is he a man,

249
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,670
he was in a manic state.
It triggered a manic state,

250
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,070
um,
and he killed himself and,

251
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,350
and,
and that was Iowasca,

252
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,210
you know,
that's like the medicine,

253
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:28,660
right?
And,

254
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:33,661
and so it just,
for some reason I think some people are 

255
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,240
deemphasizing what it means to be healed
by the psychedelic or to be worked on by

256
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:46,540
a psychedelic or to enter into that 
state because it's becoming,

257
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,510
thank God,
a De stigmatized.

258
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,330
Much more so.
Do you remember how it was 20 years ago?

259
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,820
Dude?
It was.

260
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,990
You couldn't even talk about it.
Couldn't talk about it,

261
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,190
couldn't mention it.

262
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,420
It was you.
It was bad,

263
00:12:58,421 --> 00:12:59,530
bad,
bad drugs.

264
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:03,090
It was heroin.
It was on the same level as like you,

265
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,310
if you were taking Lsd,
that was like heroin man,

266
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,330
so people will look at you like you're 
crazy and then there's also,

267
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,540
you know,
there's real problems that people have 

268
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,731
with being tested at work.
A lot of people get tested at work and 

269
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,690
people worried about losing their jobs,
so drugs don't just become a thing where

270
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:22,990
you could fuck up and you know and get 
addicted to them,

271
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:25,420
but now they become a thing that could 
take away your livelihood,

272
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,250
take away your livelihood.
That's right.

273
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:32,251
Check your pee.
They put the state of paranoia on their 

274
00:13:32,251 --> 00:13:32,350
employees.
Just imagine that feeling.

275
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,860
You're working for some office.
You probably don't dig the GIG anyway,

276
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,040
right?
You don't even like it and they have to 

277
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,040
check your pass every now and then.

278
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,110
That didn't only,
you know when.

279
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,580
Duncan,
can I see you for a moment?

280
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,660
Hi.
In high.

281
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,760
It's that time of the year.
Random drug tests.

282
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,050
So I'm just going to have to go with you
and watch you pull your penis out and 

283
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,840
put it into this cup and give me a 
little sample of your body fluids.

284
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,480
Okay,
baby.

285
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,750
Okay.
Yeah.

286
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,280
That didn't work anymore.
What if they figured a way around it so 

287
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,280
they had to collect your shit.
I need to see you.

288
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,720
Shit.
See Your asshole opened up and I need to

289
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:07,270
see that tube come out into this 
tupperware container.

290
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,860
I'm going to be there.
Yeah,

291
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:10,390
that'd be.
Thank God in a way.

292
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,250
Thank God.
That's how they detect drugs.

293
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,030
Thank God it's through the pis.
Thank God.

294
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,390
Thank God.
It's not like you,

295
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,680
you know,
like probably.

296
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:22,681
I don't know this for sure,
but I bet every asshole has a thumb 

297
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:22,681
print.
Like you know,

298
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:26,380
everybody has a different thumbprint.
I bet if you took asshole prints,

299
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:30,880
every human would also have like a 
different asshole print and like cheap.

300
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:35,890
Imagine if that was true.
If like you could see foot in 

301
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,340
fingerprints like oh look,
it gives you the ingredients.

302
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:41,590
This guy's like 60 percent asshole.
It says that we just didn't look at 

303
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,590
this.
No,

304
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,420
I don't mean asshole.
I mean the literal asshole.

305
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Oh,
like if you take a person's asshole and 

306
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600
put like and you're like,
oh,

307
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,660
like an asshole print.
Like retina squinted on ink.

308
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:49,900
Yeah,

309
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,880
it's the brown eye.
Retina scan.

310
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,450
Everyone.
Wow.

311
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,980
For sure.
Probably the asshole as a thumbprint.

312
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,850
It's just simply for sure.
Sure.

313
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:06,851
So if you took psychedelics and it 
caused that thumbprint and change a 

314
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:08,090
little bit and that's how they told 
where it's.

315
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:10,070
They don't want to look at your shit.
You just have to.

316
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:15,071
They have to look at like you're either,
they have to scan your ass in the print 

317
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:16,520
change.
You didn't Mescalin whew,

318
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,470
we're lucky it's in the piss.
But.

319
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,920
But also if you really think about the 
fact that we are in a world where people

320
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:29,690
have to go to work to do a job,
that by the way,

321
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:34,691
man,
if there is a dude you need to get on 

322
00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:34,691
this podcast and there's a book that you
would love.

323
00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:37,580
David Graber wrote this book called 
Bullshit Jobs.

324
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,580
This guy is a fucking genius man in this
book.

325
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,580
Bullshit jobs breaks down the phenomena 
of how many,

326
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:51,131
many people are working in jobs that 
don't do anything for the world or the 

327
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:55,961
company they're working for.
And it's not like this judgmental thing 

328
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:55,961
where he's like,
yeah,

329
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:57,110
that's a bullshit job.
You're a blah,

330
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:57,560
blah,
blah.

331
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,110
He's one of the,
he's like an anthropologist.

332
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:05,111
So he's very precise.
But one of the qualifications for your 

333
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:08,261
job to be a bullshit job is you know,
that it's really kind of a worthless 

334
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:09,950
job.
It's not really doing anything.

335
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:13,790
And like companies have gotten so 
fucking big that,

336
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,210
uh,
they,

337
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,260
they end up having like departments or 
people running departments or extra 

338
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,131
employees that don't really need to be 
there at all and they have to pretend to

339
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:28,160
be,
to work.

340
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,340
That's what he writes about.
He writes it that if you really want to 

341
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,080
torture a person,
uh,

342
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,520
not only give them,
like the job of like,

343
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:42,540
you know,
pouring a glass of water and an empty 

344
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,651
glass and pouring it back,
but then add to it that they have to 

345
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:49,781
deceive their boss into thinking that 
they're doing an important job or they 

346
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:52,020
lose their jobs.

347
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:57,020
So these not only are these,
like some corporations and companies 

348
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,390
scanning your pes to see if you're 
taking a substance that is allowing you 

349
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,390
to connect with home what you actually 
are.

350
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,600
They are also demanding that you spend 
many hours a day lying to them that 

351
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:16,220
you're doing work that you're not doing,
like if you're fucking efficient,

352
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,880
you know,
and this is another thing I graybar 

353
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:21,880
writes about.
Forgive me,

354
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,031
David Graver,
if in any way I've misconstrued as I 

355
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:26,390
read your writings stoned,
but the,

356
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,650
but the,
the,

357
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:28,930
um,
the,

358
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,980
the,
the other fucking element to it that is 

359
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,930
absolutely atrocious and fucking 
horrible is that these substances are 

360
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:43,100
connecting us to home.
They don't want us to be in those states

361
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:45,620
and they're asking us to fucking lie all
day.

362
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,160
And you know what psychedelic means?
The,

363
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,130
the etymology of psychedelic.
No,

364
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,020
it means mind manifesting or soul 
manifesting,

365
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,500
right?

366
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,420
So a psychedelic connects us potentially
with the truth,

367
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,580
what we are,
our identity,

368
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,950
right?
And these companies,

369
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,690
they're asking us to lie,
to be the opposite of our identities,

370
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,290
to wear weird a suit or,
or some kind of dress code.

371
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,990
And to sit in a desk where because 
you're efficient,

372
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,200
you get your job done in 45 minutes and 
for the next six hours you got to sit 

373
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,770
and type in,
pretend that you're working,

374
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,390
knowing you're a person and knowing that
this is like unethical,

375
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,500
you're.
But if you,

376
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,660
if you like go and tell your boss,
hey man,

377
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,280
I don't really have much to do,
you might get fired.

378
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,880
The boss might like in the book he cites
one person because he did like a survey 

379
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,620
and he cites one person who went to her 
boss and she's like,

380
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:48,420
Hey,
I can finish my job in two hours.

381
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,120
I need,
can I have other stuff to do?

382
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,610
And her boss is like,
don't talk about that.

383
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,970
Stay quiet about that.
Oh yeah man.

384
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's the fucking world we're in right 
now because of automation.

385
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,900
There's less to do.
Computers are making shit fat.

386
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,920
It's why are we were working the exact 
same amount of time we were when there 

387
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,840
were no computers,
but you have to be there to get paid and

388
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:12,420
you have to act like you're doing 
something or they can use.

389
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,480
Yeah.
So many people right now are doing just 

390
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,260
that while the list of this a lot,
a lot,

391
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,330
and by the way,
if you had to guess what percentage of 

392
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,831
people are listening right now that are 
really supposed to be doing some 

393
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:31,371
bullshit job and they're kind of sitting
in front of their keyboard with earbuds 

394
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,450
on,
just barely paying attention.

395
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,980
Try not to get caught looking at porn.

396
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:40,410
Yeah,
I probably an all over the planet at 

397
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,300
over a million.
Over a million in the work

398
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,350
forest probably.
When do you think companies had to put 

399
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,740
in rules?
You can't look at porn at work.

400
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,860
Like that wasn't a thing in the 
seventies who wasn't a thing in the 

401
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,020
eighties.
It wasn't a thing in the nine,

402
00:19:56,021 --> 00:20:01,021
zero s then all the sudden you could 
just find porn online and people will.

403
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:05,000
They have a work computer that's hooked 
up to the Internet.

404
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,700
Like when did the company start going?
Oh yeah,

405
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:08,810
we didn't know about that.
Yeah,

406
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:09,620
you can't look at that

407
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,520
dude.
And I mean I'm sure it started with like

408
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,280
Penthouse,
right?

409
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:14,790
Like even when they have penthouse 
penthouse magazine,

410
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:19,791
like when you had fucking like,
you know for sure you couldn't bring 

411
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,820
your pen out of your fucking hustler to 
work.

412
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,120
That's true.
But the but looking at something online 

413
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,500
is so much easier than going to the 
store and getting a hustler.

414
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:32,670
Like the access is universal,
instantaneous.

415
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,690
Everyone has the ability to just go and 
download it,

416
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,750
you know,
if we're going to like ask questions 

417
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,001
that are impossible to answer.
Like how many people right now do you 

418
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:47,391
think listening to the podcast or in 
their bullshit job jerking off to while 

419
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:47,980
they

420
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,300
listened?
At least one dude.

421
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,330
But yeah,
for sure.

422
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,150
That's what dudes do.
Yeah,

423
00:20:56,151 --> 00:20:57,940
I mean because you can get away with it.
They jerk off.

424
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:01,090
Especially a guy with a bad job who 
could find a way to jerk off somewhere.

425
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,030
Let me just five minutes in this 
bathroom with jerk off.

426
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,790
Just think about the stupid fucking job.
Dude.

427
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,010
Come on.
Like that's like sexual assault.

428
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,180
I don't think off in an office.
Not In the what if you scream,

429
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,770
if everyone knows the going to go great.
Hey,

430
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,860
I'm going to go in there,
I'm going to jerk off and when I come I 

431
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:21,860
scream that sexual assault.
Oh for.

432
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,810
Well that is.
I fucking feel like suing you right now,

433
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:26,640
man.
Fucked up.

434
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,500
You work with some guy and he's like 300
pounds and you're like 150 pounds and 

435
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:35,310
you're like,
hey man,

436
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,280
I need to figure out how to fix this 
computer.

437
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,080
We're going to have to unplug everything
for what?

438
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,740
He goes.
Okay,

439
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:42,360
cool.
I'm going to go in the bathroom.

440
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,300
I don't want to jerk off.
And when I come I scream.

441
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,050
Dude,
I don't know.

442
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:49,120
I even have to add the scream too.
And it's like,

443
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,870
I mean I,
I think Santa for

444
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,240
a dude,
it's a terrible prospect.

445
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,780
I think it's interesting too because 
when you consider like the act of 

446
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,230
shitting versus the act of jerking off 
is like far more repulsive.

447
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:07,231
You're,
you're expelling like foul smelling 

448
00:22:07,231 --> 00:22:09,440
toxins from your body into the toilet.
And if you say to your friend,

449
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:11,360
Hey,
I gotta go take a shit man,

450
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,950
he,
your friends probably going to be like,

451
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,330
well,
you didn't need to tell me that.

452
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:15,590
Like,
okay,

453
00:22:15,591 --> 00:22:16,030
I don't,
but,

454
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,170
but he,
but your friend's not going to be like,

455
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,240
Whoa Dude,
what?

456
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,170
And yet jerking off,
really if you think about it,

457
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,940
it's like you're giving yourself a 
hamish massage the end,

458
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:30,320
just like a little spray of like cream 
coming out it horrific.

459
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,650
It's like,
it's like what?

460
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,100
But in our culture,
like,

461
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,840
no,
no,

462
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,750
don't do it at the office.
My God,

463
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:39,350
John,

464
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,580
don't do it here.
John.

465
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,470
I'm just picture John just with an itchy
trigger finger just ready to reach into 

466
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:49,650
his pants.

467
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:55,170
No,
no John.

468
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,490
No.
Did you do it again John?

469
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,970
It's a gross relationship that the 
worker has now with the corporation and 

470
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,760
it's an unnatural relationship and it's 
a relationship that seems to have like 

471
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,620
dehumanized people to the point of being
automatons that don't have a sex drive,

472
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:18,460
that don't deserve to be able to explore
their consciousness.

473
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,290
And um,
this is uh,

474
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,170
a real problem.
And

475
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,760
I'd already told me what he studied the 
Talmud and did it for like 12 hours a 

476
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,260
day when he was a young,
young man.

477
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,570
He told me that there was one passage 
where in one of the ancient texts where 

478
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:41,260
it was talking about battling a dragon 
and he said,

479
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:46,290
he's like,
this doesn't make sense because 

480
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:46,290
everything in here is supposed to be a 
story that actually

481
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,440
happened.
Like what is this dragon?

482
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,590
Or The dragon is a metaphor for 
masturbation.

483
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:56,830
They tell them.
So the dragon that takes away young 

484
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:56,990
boys.
This is,

485
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,220
it is.
It is a metaphor for masturbation.

486
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,770
Dan talked about this on the podcast.
Yes,

487
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,700
dude,
it's,

488
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,600
it's,
you know,

489
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,610
Ari knows about as much as anyone you're
ever going to meet about Orthodox Jewish

490
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:16,070
traditions and the religion and the,
the tax.

491
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:21,071
He really did study that shit every day.
Twelve hours a day for year in Israel,

492
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,160
right?
Yeah.

493
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,340
Yeah.
So when he tells you about it and he got

494
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:30,341
the,
he got the actual translation of the 

495
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:31,310
metaphor from a guy who's a scholar.

496
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,320
Yeah,
Dude.

497
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,470
Yeah.
That's a bad metaphor.

498
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,620
That's like,
I think like if I wanted for whatever 

499
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:40,620
reason to dissuade people from jerking 
off,

500
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,470
I could come up with a way better like 
thing than a dragon to represent it,

501
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,670
you know,
there'd be some other thing like a,

502
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,160
I don't know,
man,

503
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:50,680
like what's like,
uh,

504
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:56,510
what,
what would be like the creature version 

505
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:59,310
of a rolled up ball of dried come that 
you've thrown next to your bed and 

506
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:05,491
someone walks into your bedroom and sees
the rolled up ball of dried come clean x

507
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:06,940
and it's just kinda like,
that's gross.

508
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:08,770
You didn't clean up your common clean x.

509
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,420
It would be like one of them ghostbuster
villains,

510
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,570
right?
Some sort of plasma thing that just 

511
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:16,570
Jesus all over,
you know,

512
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:21,101
they'd get ghostbusters.
What do you think about the Antifa 

513
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:21,650
movement?
Anti-Fat movement?

514
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:22,880
FAP,
fap.

515
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,840
Oh No,
no,

516
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:24,860
jerking off.
Yeah.

517
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,100
No fat.
Not anti-fat and diagnosed at different.

518
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,110
Moving.
Well,

519
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:35,140
there's good and bad.
The good thing is sex will be way more 

520
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,561
pleasurable.
The bad is it'll be way more desirable 

521
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:42,970
so like to,
to mitigate your sexual urges so you 

522
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:46,100
don't do stupid things and hanging out 
with stupid people,

523
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:51,150
have sex with people you don't really 
like but you think are hot because 

524
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:51,630
you're horny and they're willing,
which is a lot of people they get,

525
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,700
they get wrapped up in these 
relationships with these guys and gals 

526
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,340
that they're not really in love with,
but they like to fuck,

527
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,560
you know,
I'm,

528
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,190
you know,
it's like,

529
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,190
what do you think about it?

530
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,260
Well,
I think that there,

531
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,360
you know,
was something I always think back on is 

532
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,501
when you were sponsored by fleshlight in
this is when we were doing the podcast 

533
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:22,611
from your house and you'd come to do 
your podcast and you'd walk away with a 

534
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:26,211
flashlight.
So I ended up with like three or four 

535
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:29,340
flashlights.
And like at first I just wanted like,

536
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:32,250
you had different types and at first I 
just went for like,

537
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:35,130
oh the one that looks like a pussy.
Right?

538
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,300
But then like,
you know,

539
00:26:36,301 --> 00:26:36,840
it's like,
oh,

540
00:26:36,841 --> 00:26:41,841
I got that one.
But then you have like one that was 

541
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:41,841
like,
I don't know,

542
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:43,050
man,
like some kind of like garlic oil alien.

543
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,380
It was really nice.
It was really fucking weird man.

544
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:48,020
But anyway,
you know,

545
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,560
I fuck those things.
And,

546
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,390
and uh,
and,

547
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:52,520
and,
and I,

548
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,130
when I think back to it,
it's like the first time I did it,

549
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,110
it tricked my brain.
The second time or third time I did it,

550
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:06,111
it wasn't getting the same effect.
Whereas when I have sex with a human,

551
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,740
it's a completely different.
It feels like it's a completely 

552
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,020
different series of chemicals that must 
be being released in my mind

553
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,850
uniting with someone you're bonding with
someone,

554
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,330
you certainly get the oxytocin from 
orgasming together,

555
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,130
bonds people.

556
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,880
So I've always thought generally like if
I'm in a period in my life,

557
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:33,260
arm jerk jerking awful lot,
it's like usually like there's something

558
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:36,950
imbalanced in there.
Like I don't mean to apply like a sin to

559
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:39,410
it at all.
I'm just saying like personally it feels

560
00:27:39,411 --> 00:27:43,700
a little dissipative when you're doing 
it a lot.

561
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,590
There is this,
I don't know,

562
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,580
that's completely agree.
That's the balance.

563
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:51,310
But the balance is also like you don't 
want to just be horny all the time.

564
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,400
No,
because when you're hunting you make 

565
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:56,400
shitty decisions.
So you like,

566
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,190
yeah,
you'll date someone just for sex.

567
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,140
Yeah.
Well you need to like.

568
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:04,230
I mean I think that there is something 
to be said for figuring out how to deal 

569
00:28:07,661 --> 00:28:10,060
with like the,
that kind of energy.

570
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,240
So that's an,
that's an energetic state.

571
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:16,480
Like if suddenly you get being horny is 
an energetic state.

572
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,920
Yeah.
It's energy.

573
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:21,430
Like if you're really horny and you sit 
and like watch the,

574
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,350
the feeling itself,
it's electrical.

575
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,230
You could feel it moving around in your 
body.

576
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,240
It like,
it can almost make a twitchy a little 

577
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,841
bit.
Like it's like a very potent energetic 

578
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:37,201
state.
So theoretically instead of trying to 

579
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:42,001
get the question would be rather is 
there a way to release that energy that 

580
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:45,370
isn't through the tip of my Dick in the 
form of DNA?

581
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:50,550
Is there a way for me to release that 
energy in other ways or is the only way 

582
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,640
the only valve on that to come?
That's a question.

583
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:55,180
What do you think?

584
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,220
I think there's this natural buildup 
happens.

585
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,280
It makes people more easily aroused,
it makes people more concentrating on 

586
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:10,080
sex and I think that that can put you 
out of balance too.

587
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,890
You can be put out of balanced both by 
too much masturbation.

588
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:17,640
You could definitely be put out of 
balance by too much desire for sex.

589
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,710
Yeah,
because you just horny show you just 

590
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,040
take care of it yourself and you'd be 
relieved and then you can think clearer.

591
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,090
You know?
I think the body needs a balance.

592
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:32,091
Right.
That's why I'm a big proponent of 

593
00:29:32,091 --> 00:29:33,621
exercise.
I'm a big proponent of meditation and 

594
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:34,060
mindfulness and just trying to.
I mean it's.

595
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,510
That's all those are toxic words right 
now.

596
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,480
Meditation and mindfulness.
Yeah.

597
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,710
They've been thrown around by too many 
knuckleheads.

598
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,910
Like there's something about it that 
it's like,

599
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,830
oh,
that's kind of a bull shitty word.

600
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,330
You kind of know what I mean.
You're like,

601
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,680
oh,
I'm just all about mindfulness.

602
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:48,120
Like,
oh,

603
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,290
you're annoying.
That's what you are.

604
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,670
The annoying guy.

605
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,220
I,
I,

606
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,140
I saw a book just yesterday and one of 
these boutique stores,

607
00:29:56,141 --> 00:30:00,020
someone had made a star cast at kids but
called the grownups guide to mindfulness

608
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:05,030
and whoever wrote that fucking book 
hates the word mindful.

609
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:11,020
Definitely has an obnoxious friend who's
into mindfulness because of the book is 

610
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,390
just like A.
First of all,

611
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,270
the guy doesn't seem to really 
understand what it is in the book.

612
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:19,271
Like it's a,
he seemed a little confused about the 

613
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:19,271
nature of it,
but uh,

614
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:19,880
and I remember looking at that and been 
like,

615
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:24,940
oh,
I guess people are getting annoyed with 

616
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,730
the word mindfulness now.
Like the pendulum swinging that way.

617
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:26,630
Yeah.

618
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,310
Yeah.
It's one of those words that people love

619
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:34,311
to say it sounds good and it makes you 
seem like a spiritual person.

620
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,420
So it gets when it gets moved around and
used too much,

621
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,940
like something happens to where it gets 
icky.

622
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,430
Yeah.
Because it's like it becomes popular and

623
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:49,431
then people start using it and then you 
see like a bunch of phony guru type 

624
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,630
dudes at seminars using it.
What's important here is mindfulness.

625
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,520
Very important that,
you know,

626
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:57,600
there's like typically unique behaviors,
you know what I mean?

627
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,690
There's,
there's,

628
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,720
there's,
especially when it comes to like people 

629
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,320
that are full of shit as like a typical 
uniqueness.

630
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:09,540
Like there's just a thing that a lot of 
people adopt and it sounds like everyone

631
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:12,750
else and it's just a way that people do 
it.

632
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,040
And uh,
I,

633
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,800
I hope you understand like,
what are you doing?

634
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,070
Why are you doing that?
You're adopting this weird,

635
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:25,071
funky thing and you know,
I think it's really important that we 

636
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:25,290
practice mindfulness.
It falls into that.

637
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,320
It falls into that even though it's an 
excellent practice.

638
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,520
Well,
it's very important,

639
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,850
but people,
you know,

640
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,740
it's called in.
I,

641
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,660
I just,
I now have,

642
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,940
I took on,
for lack of a better word,

643
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,030
I'm working with a actual,
a teacher of the [inaudible] lineage of 

644
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,780
Buddhism,
which is Chogyam.

645
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:47,310
Trungpa is lineage of Buddhism and he's 
amazing and he's,

646
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,830
and he's teaching me mindfulness 
meditation practice.

647
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,010
This Guy David nichtern.
But um,

648
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:58,110
how does he deal with masturbation?
What's cool about him is if you asked 

649
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,110
him,
he'd,

650
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,270
he would tell you.
I'm sure there's no like,

651
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,050
yeah,
with,

652
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,310
you know,
that he wouldn't be like,

653
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:03,770
wow,
dad,

654
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:08,810
you asked me that question,
but I think that probably I don't,

655
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:14,250
I can't answer for him.
I think it would fall in line with what 

656
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:14,250
you're saying with balance,
you know,

657
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,850
which is that.
It's really like a sort of the concept 

658
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:23,191
with it is the thing that is happening 
right now.

659
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,330
Whatever it may be,
you can just,

660
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,960
you know,
apply mindfulness to it.

661
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:33,961
You could apply like a being in the 
moment and being with the thing that's 

662
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:36,250
happening right now.
And so the,

663
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,460
the thing he's teaching me,
I love it so much because it isn't,

664
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:46,390
we will we or like out there crazy.
It's literally this very simple way that

665
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:54,380
you meditate with the way that you sit,
which is you sit on a cushion,

666
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,900
you put your hands on your knees in and 
you sit back and that he,

667
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,950
the word they use in this Kagyu lineage.
Ford is the warrior pose.

668
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,130
And what that means is that it's a kind 
of confidence.

669
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:10,340
It's the way,
like people who are like confident sit.

670
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,650
So you sit like that when you're 
meditating,

671
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:17,651
you're legs are crossed and you sit in a
chair if you want and you look straight 

672
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:20,210
ahead about eight feet,
nine feet,

673
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,390
and you watch your breath and when you 
go into your thoughts,

674
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,510
which happens,
of course you go,

675
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,810
you think thinking and then you go back 
to your breath.

676
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,480
That's it.
You say thinking,

677
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,790
you don't say it,
you think it.

678
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,350
Thank.
Thank you.

679
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,320
Thinking just so [inaudible] what?
What's all these.

680
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:44,321
So like what,
what you start realizing when you start 

681
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:46,550
this practice and full disclosure here,
man,

682
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:51,551
you know me Joe,
I have problems with discipline and I 

683
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:54,071
have problems with like sticking to 
stuff over and over again and working 

684
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:55,210
with this guy has been incredible 
because it's actually getting me to,

685
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,320
to do it right.
Uh,

686
00:33:57,321 --> 00:34:00,980
but still I have like I did it today.
I didn't do it yesterday.

687
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:05,981
I'm just,
I don't want to get out there and some 

688
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:06,630
nonsense that I'm like spending all day 
long meditating.

689
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,320
But what you start seeing is when you're
doing it is you realize like,

690
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:17,380
oh,
there's a cycle happening in my 

691
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:17,380
consciousness.
In my mind,

692
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:17,720
there's a cycle that's happening in my 
life,

693
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,750
which is that I kind of blink into the 
moment following the breath and I blink 

694
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,830
out of the moment into the thought 
realm,

695
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:25,370
right?

696
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,940
We're like little fireflies wee flicker 
into the moment.

697
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,530
We're here now.
We're here,

698
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:35,531
we're not lost in our thoughts.
We're not thinking about the next thing 

699
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,411
we're going to say.
We're not thinking about the next thing 

700
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:38,411
we're going to do.
We're just here in this moment.

701
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:39,830
And then we're off.
You know,

702
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,990
often running,
like thinking about the bills,

703
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,660
forget about the girl thinking about the
thing,

704
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,840
thinking about that.
And then that leads to another thought 

705
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:49,840
and another thought.
Next thing you know,

706
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,760
you've been thinking for three years 
straight,

707
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
you know what I mean,
or three minutes or five hours or 

708
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,641
whatever,
and then you come back and that's the 

709
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:01,160
cycle.
This is a cycle that happens.

710
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:06,161
So mindfulness is starting to pay 
attention and,

711
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,680
and,
and,

712
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,890
and to that cycle.
But,

713
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:15,070
and the breathing thing is kind of like 
a respiratory mnemonic device,

714
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:21,100
which is that suddenly what's been 
happening to me now is I'll just be like

715
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,260
walking down the street in the notice my
breath.

716
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,080
Oh Shit,
I'm back.

717
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,800
Oh,
I'm here.

718
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:29,510
I was totally over my head.
Oh,

719
00:35:29,511 --> 00:35:30,950
I'm back.
That was thinking,

720
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,260
you know,
that's all.

721
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:35,000
It's very,
very,

722
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:40,001
very simple.
But he's just teaching me the basic 

723
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:40,001
right now.
It does.

724
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:40,001
I

725
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:42,210
think it pretty interesting on my own 
thinking about my own life and observing

726
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:47,211
other people's lives.
I've come up with this thing that I 

727
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,830
bring up all the time.
The momentum of your past like your,

728
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:53,850
your,
like so many people as they're going 

729
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:56,961
down the street.
So many people as they're interacting 

730
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:57,480
with people,
they're carrying the momentum of all the

731
00:35:57,481 --> 00:36:02,481
fucked up things that are going on.
Bills that they have to pay and things 

732
00:36:02,481 --> 00:36:05,070
that they forgot to do and a career they
never chase.

733
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:06,690
And a girl,
they never called back.

734
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:11,691
And the thing that they lied about,
a thing they stole and the reason why 

735
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:12,670
they got fired from work.
And maybe if I call my boss,

736
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:16,170
I'll get my and all this craziness 
you're bringing with you into everything

737
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:21,570
that is so hard to escape.
It's so hard for people to escape the 

738
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:21,570
momentum of the past.

739
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,990
You know,
people sort of get into this thing of 

740
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,710
defining themselves by failures,
by past failures.

741
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:31,650
And it never just learning from them go 
on that fucking loser.

742
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:37,080
It's a real problem.
It's a real problem with people to be 

743
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,680
able to learn from something and to just
look at yourself.

744
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,920
And it's painful to look at yourself.
So everybody wants to pretend that they 

745
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,130
didn't do anything wrong right there.
Everybody else is an asshole and that.

746
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,180
Yeah.
And so when you're doing what you're 

747
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,030
doing by doing that is you're stunting 
your own growth.

748
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:53,850
You feel like you're protecting yourself
because you're protecting your ego.

749
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,670
You're like,
you know,

750
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,640
I didn't do anything wrong.
Fuck him.

751
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:58,590
He's the asshole.
But you know,

752
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,060
you could've avoided that.
You know,

753
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:05,061
you could've done better.
Like everybody has moments like that in 

754
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:08,451
their life and the more you avoid those 
and don't take credit for the ones that 

755
00:37:08,451 --> 00:37:12,051
you actually fucked up,
the more you actually hurt yourself in 

756
00:37:12,051 --> 00:37:13,800
this ironic thing because it seems like 
you're protecting yourself.

757
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,860
Know your.
I'm exonerating myself from guilt as 

758
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:18,860
fuck it.
It wasn't me.

759
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:18,860
Oh,
didn't do it,

760
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:23,660
but you know you did so in your head,
you're the guy who lies about making 

761
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,600
mistakes instead of you're the guy who 
mans up to your mistakes and realizes it

762
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:29,970
was a mistake and then vows to do 
better.

763
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,900
Yeah,
man,

764
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,490
that's beautiful.
That's beautiful.

765
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,350
You have to just have to be able to say 
you're wrong.

766
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,820
You have to be able to say,
I'm sorry.

767
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,240
You have to be able to,
and you got to be able to look at 

768
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:41,340
yourself like all the time.
Now you've just,

769
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:43,680
when you fuck up,
because you can avoid some of those fuck

770
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:48,681
ups.
Just look at yourself critically along 

771
00:37:48,681 --> 00:37:50,931
the way,
but we all have to understand that 

772
00:37:50,931 --> 00:37:51,630
we're.
We are all in evolving process.

773
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,910
Like I had this conversation with Dennis
Mckenna.

774
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:56,670
It's a crazy conversation because it's a
ridiculous thing to say,

775
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,630
but he was talking about a Donald Trump 
and I was saying,

776
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,320
d,
isn't it possible that he could grow and

777
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:04,530
learn?

778
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:09,530
Like why do we give up on people?
Why does a guy get to a certain age and 

779
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:09,530
we say,
oh,

780
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,340
he's 60.
He set in his ways.

781
00:38:11,341 --> 00:38:12,870
He's 70.
He'll never change.

782
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:17,871
You'll never evolve.
You don't ever say that about a 20 year 

783
00:38:17,871 --> 00:38:20,721
old.
You see some asshole who's a 20 year 

784
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:22,431
old.
He said he just needs discipline and 

785
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:25,280
just needs.
Love finds the right pr people in his 

786
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,280
life,
right person to love.

787
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,660
He'll be okay.
He's gonna mature and eventually he's 

788
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:29,660
going to be a solid man,
but you get to a certain age.

789
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,220
We just give up on you just like you're 
still alive,

790
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:37,221
but you've passed the cycle that I 
usually people to be ready to sort of 

791
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,340
interact as valuable creative,
loving members of society.

792
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,510
Pass that by.
You're still thinking about yourself.

793
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:46,240
Only deepen your sixties.
This is stupid shit.

794
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,610
This is shit you're supposed to do when 
you're 17.

795
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,490
By the time you're 70,
you're supposed to be going,

796
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,260
oh my God,
I don't have much time left.

797
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,690
Oh my God,
what have I done while I'm here?

798
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:57,430
What do.
What is it important?

799
00:38:57,431 --> 00:39:02,431
What do I feel the best about?
I feel the best about love and 

800
00:39:02,431 --> 00:39:05,401
companionship and friendship and real 
warmth and interaction between people 

801
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:06,730
that you care about.
This money thing,

802
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:07,690
man,
this is not.

803
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,750
You can't keep chasing this.
Can't keep chasing power.

804
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,060
Can't keep chasing money.
You're gonna.

805
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:15,760
Reach a point where it's not going to 
matter because you're going to die,

806
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,430
so you really want to be that guy from 
the bumper sticker.

807
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:23,431
He who dies with the most toys wins 
because this is literally what you're 

808
00:39:23,431 --> 00:39:24,070
working towards.
You're working towards a joke.

809
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,450
Yeah.
Well I will let.

810
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,390
Can I.
One thing I would add to that is that,

811
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,480
so what you're saying here,
and you're.

812
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,750
You're right man,
but the one thing I think I disagree 

813
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,430
with you on is that you're creating a 
situation where that's it.

814
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,910
You die and that's it.
The momentum smack the momentum goes 

815
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,460
into a black hole.
It's gone.

816
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:48,520
Like the momentum has been like as 
disintegrates vanishes,

817
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:49,450
that momentum,
right?

818
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,700
But the way I've been taught is that 
actually that momentum keeps going.

819
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,760
That momentum doesn't just stop because 
your body stops,

820
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:00,790
right?
So that momentum keeps going and in fact

821
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,970
the,
what's really beautiful is like.

822
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,010
And it's good that you call it momentum.
That's exactly what it is,

823
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,380
what it feels like with me.
It's a tendency,

824
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,990
we have a tendency towards a certain 
thing.

825
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:15,991
We have proclivities and tendencies and 
habituation and if you just kind of 

826
00:40:15,991 --> 00:40:18,700
like,
if you put you in me in a room and put a

827
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:21,310
bunch of different objects on the floor,
right,

828
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,480
you're gonna go toward something and I'm
going to go towards something else,

829
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:25,840
right.

830
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:31,170
You know,
if there's fucking vr goggles and a in 

831
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:31,170
a,
in a God damn bad ass,

832
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:35,641
like some kind of like bad ass compound 
bow manufactured it fucking Darpa.

833
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:42,210
You know what I mean?
And there's vr goggles manufactured by 

834
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:42,210
Darpa.
I don't know,

835
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,871
I'm going for the VR goggles.
You're probably going to go for the 

836
00:40:45,871 --> 00:40:45,871
cross or the boat,
right?

837
00:40:45,871 --> 00:40:46,150
So we have proclivities.
We have.

838
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,680
That's the momentum,
right?

839
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,800
That is one way you can understand what 
Karma is,

840
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,960
right?
So that's the momentum.

841
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:56,410
That's the moment.
So that thing that you've got right now,

842
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,620
when you begin to really look at it and 
think about it,

843
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,500
you could ask yourself,
when did this start?

844
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,600
This momentum,
right?

845
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:09,601
When did this,
these proclivities and tendencies and 

846
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:11,230
things that I'm being like sort of 
pushed towards.

847
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:16,231
When did they start in?
A lot of it is your parents taught you 

848
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
certain things,
but

849
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:21,080
well,
let's talk about a super common one 

850
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,080
that's horrible.
Cigarettes you,

851
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,430
you got cooked by that bug.
Are He got hooked by that bug?

852
00:41:23,431 --> 00:41:26,430
Red Band still hooked.
Joey Diaz kicked it.

853
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,350
You know that's a.
that's a really,

854
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:30,420
really,
really common one.

855
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:35,421
Man.
That's sorta defines people on that guy 

856
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:35,421
who I'm

857
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:36,950
going to walk into this store and even 
though I know these things cause cancer,

858
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:39,860
I'm going to buy a pack.
I'm gonna go outside and I can't wait to

859
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:44,861
light it up.
I'm just not even thinking about that 

860
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:44,861
right now,
man.

861
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:44,861
I'm trying to relax.
And you get that thing in your mouth.

862
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:49,220
There you go.
And you take that drag and you feel that

863
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,520
cancer causing chemical rush.
Yup.

864
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,990
And you're like,
I'll take it,

865
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,690
I'm alright today.
No cancer.

866
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,040
You take a big deep breath in and blow 
it out.

867
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:02,330
And you look at the other fellow cancer 
dodgers and they're just looking at Jill

868
00:42:02,331 --> 00:42:06,710
and smoking together and everybody just 
really good at dodging cancer.

869
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:07,460
So,
you know,

870
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:11,060
another one way you could actually say 
it is like every time you do that you're

871
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,240
planting a seed.
So every time you smoke a cigarette,

872
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:17,750
you could imagine that you have this 
field right in the field is your health.

873
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,170
And in that field,
anytime you like exercise or do 

874
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:23,170
something,
you know,

875
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,700
decide instead of eating the fucking ice
cream you're going to eat.

876
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:28,250
The seaweed chips are like,
anytime you do that,

877
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:31,370
you could just imagine obviously it's 
not the way it works exactly.

878
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:33,350
But you could think I'm planting a seed 
in this field,

879
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,380
right?
So if I keep planning certain types of 

880
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,970
seeds and any type of field and I 
cultivate those seeds,

881
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,910
they're going to grow into something,
right?

882
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,030
That's Karma.
So what,

883
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:48,760
when,
when you know for a person,

884
00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:52,150
when the cancer comes,
when the muscles come,

885
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,390
when the failure comes,
when the success comes,

886
00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:00,990
if you look at that moment,
you realized this is actually the 

887
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,921
flowering of a thing that's been growing
for a very long time inside of me or in 

888
00:43:05,261 --> 00:43:10,261
the world or in time.
So that's the idea people already have 

889
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:12,940
within them planted.
All of these seeds haven't,

890
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,260
haven't been expressed yet into time 
because they're still inside of them.

891
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:22,261
Like the dude with the like imagine a 
guy with the guy who shot the guy 

892
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:23,710
because he had road rage.
You know,

893
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:29,490
that guy for years had a really bad 
anger disorder and he knew it.

894
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:35,220
He would look.
He would think at times in this very 

895
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,370
moment,
I get really angry all the time.

896
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,140
I don't know if this is normal,

897
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:43,270
right?
A lot of those people were beaten when 

898
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,270
they were kids.

899
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,270
That's it,
dude.

900
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

901
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,630
Common Super Common Trauma.
So yeah man,

902
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:52,660
that's like cigarette smoking.
Any kind of behavior that like is risky 

903
00:43:53,991 --> 00:43:57,700
or over time produces some kind of 
negative result.

904
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,570
It's just planting seeds.
You know,

905
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:05,620
and so the momentum you're experiencing 
right now is the sum total of all those 

906
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:10,781
fucking seeds that you planted and that 
were planted inside of you over the 

907
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:12,830
course of your life.
That's what you're,

908
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:17,860
you are,
you're like a walking field of Karma at 

909
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,671
varying stages of growth,
growing varying types of vegetation and 

910
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:27,370
some are good and some are bad,
but it's like that's what you are right 

911
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:31,390
now.
And what's beautiful about that is that 

912
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:32,010
means that you can start cultivating 
field.

913
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,010
You know,
you don't have to just like let it grow 

914
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,711
wild and,
and pretend every time you smoke a 

915
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:41,340
cigarette or do some stupid shit,
you're like an unconscious farmer.

916
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,660
Oh my God,
what?

917
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:50,530
I'm drinking and driving again,
but I got to get home.

918
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,630
Oh Shit.
Oh my God.

919
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:57,010
The Dui plant grew again in the field.
I wonder why that thing keeps growing in

920
00:44:57,011 --> 00:45:01,520
my field.
You keep fucking drinking and driving,

921
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,640
dude.
The Dui play out.

922
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:04,970
Yeah.
Oh God.

923
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,050
Yeah,
yeah,

924
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,700
yeah.
You can cultivate it.

925
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:09,260
That's what's beautiful about it.
You know,

926
00:45:09,261 --> 00:45:14,261
you can cultivate the field.
You don't have to let it just have 

927
00:45:14,261 --> 00:45:17,440
fucking weird random weeds spring up 
though when a patch or to have some 

928
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:17,780
weeds because those are fun.

929
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:22,980
Imagine spending that tobacco money and 
spending that money thinking about all 

930
00:45:23,191 --> 00:45:25,930
that cancer,
spending all that money.

931
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,860
God just buying a big castle.
What all that cancer money.

932
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,870
Castle cancer.
Hey,

933
00:45:31,871 --> 00:45:33,610
the people want it.
They want it.

934
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:38,730
Yet in this country,
you've got the freedom to buy whatever 

935
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:38,730
you want.

936
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:38,730
Well,
yeah,

937
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:39,010
right.
I mean it's a person's choice,

938
00:45:39,011 --> 00:45:44,011
but.
But to get back to what you were just 

939
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:44,011
saying,
the ethics of the fucking day.

940
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:47,240
How about this?
How many people who run big tobacco own 

941
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:51,120
stock in companies that make 
chemotherapy drugs?

942
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:57,080
There is a big question like how many of
those people in their portfolio that 

943
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,080
they barely know about,
they're like,

944
00:45:58,081 --> 00:45:58,650
well,
you know,

945
00:45:58,651 --> 00:46:03,651
like a really big investment these days 
is a k gene therapy for cancer.

946
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,640
Really

947
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,170
cancer out of hand these days.
Huh?

948
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,930
Interesting.
I wonder what could be going wrong.

949
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,720
The problem with cigarettes is that 
they're addictive.

950
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,870
Will just kill you.
Yeah,

951
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:18,840
but that they're addictive.
Like I,

952
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:21,940
I've smoked a cigarette before and it 
gives you a head rush.

953
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,090
Wasn't like a nice little weird rush.
It's.

954
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:29,550
And also the,
the other problem is nicotine is a 

955
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,420
madison and,
and it has like some health benefits if 

956
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,080
used in the right way.
And also it's a nootropic so yeah,

957
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,630
it's not,
it's not just like it gives you a rush.

958
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:42,200
It's like it's it,
it's a little bit.

959
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,480
Steven King said that was one of the 
most difficult things when he quit 

960
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,760
smoking was not having one way.
Right?

961
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:49,740
That's right.
Yeah,

962
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:50,220
yeah,
yeah.

963
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:52,240
Because you,
because that's the nature of addiction.

964
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,990
It's like Kudzu dies,
did trees.

965
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,430
It wraps around your favorite thing in 
life and tricks you ended Kudzu.

966
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:05,060
Kudzu is a plant that was introduced 
from Japan and I think from Japan into 

967
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:09,351
the south and it's just a growing.
We vine that when it wraps around trees 

968
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:17,390
and it covers them up completely so the 
trees can't get any sun and the trees 

969
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:17,490
just die.
Yeah.

970
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:20,430
It wasn't native to the United States,
so sometimes,

971
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:21,880
I don't know,
maybe they took care of Gutsy,

972
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:26,881
but when I was a kid you would drive by 
these beautiful forests that were where 

973
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:28,490
the trees were just covered in.
Fucking cuts it.

974
00:47:28,491 --> 00:47:29,070
Yeah.
Like,

975
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:32,230
yeah,
that's crazy.

976
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,320
It's like they got eaten other plant.
That's right,

977
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:36,910
man.
And those trees are dying.

978
00:47:36,911 --> 00:47:37,990
They can't get the sun.
The.

979
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,360
Oh my God.
It's insane.

980
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:45,620
And that's a great metaphor for 
addiction or for [inaudible] is a 

981
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,000
perfect metaphor.
Yeah.

982
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:47,380
My God.
That's insane.

983
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,650
How did I not know about this?
It's definitely seems like something 

984
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:52,650
you'd know about.
Look,

985
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:53,920
it looks like they're alive.
It looks like people do.

986
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:57,130
There's just too much to know.
There's too much cool shit.

987
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,660
Shit out there.
Too much.

988
00:47:58,690 --> 00:47:59,310
Look at that.
Felt.

989
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,390
Go to the one above that.
Above that.

990
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:03,460
Above that one,
right above that.

991
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,360
Yeah.
That one.

992
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,600
Look at that.
Yeah,

993
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,450
the green.
That is.

994
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,040
That's insane.
Dude.

995
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:11,620
That does something weird.
Your brain beautiful.

996
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:16,740
It's like,
it makes you feel like you're like 

997
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,531
you're on a drug.
Like if you were standing there and it 

998
00:48:19,531 --> 00:48:20,620
was that green and that like vibrant,
you'd be like,

999
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,610
oh my God.

1000
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,630
Yup.
Yeah,

1001
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:27,631
you would.
It would feel so good when you ever see 

1002
00:48:27,631 --> 00:48:27,631
anything that looks like that.
I say,

1003
00:48:27,631 --> 00:48:29,640
let those fuckers take over.
Let do,

1004
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,620
take over trees.
Can't fight off the Kudzu.

1005
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:35,230
They don't deserve to live.
You have to fucking evolve.

1006
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:38,590
These cuts were cooler.
They're offering your cooler look,

1007
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:39,220
but he's like,
hey,

1008
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:42,220
you want to look at your boring ass 
fucking gray bar?

1009
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,380
Bullshit leaves on the ground or how 
about we just take over everything?

1010
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,220
What the fuck are we cover?
The floor carpet?

1011
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:54,330
Yeah,
we covered the floor and the hillsides 

1012
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:54,330
and all the trees.
Everything Green is.

1013
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:54,760
Fuck.
Okay.

1014
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,370
Well what kind of green like flow green 
man,

1015
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,150
like vibrant flow green will you.
If you smoke weed there,

1016
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:03,910
you're going to trip balls.
Yeah.

1017
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:04,900
Look at that.
What is that?

1018
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,800
A covered it.
Statue is at a golf statue.

1019
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:10,080
That's just this telephone pole light 
pole that it seems like so good.

1020
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:15,080
Have sculpted that a little bit maybe.
Or maybe it's just really covering a 

1021
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:15,640
light pole.
Yeah,

1022
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:17,710
yeah man,
there you go.

1023
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:22,711
So that,
that that's like a really funny thing 

1024
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:22,711
that like,
like alcoholics,

1025
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:27,121
they'll get their alcoholism wound up 
and their social life or like their 

1026
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,990
creativity,
their creative cycle,

1027
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:31,210
so they will think like,
fuck man,

1028
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:36,211
without the booze,
I don't think I'm going to be able to 

1029
00:49:36,211 --> 00:49:37,030
write as well or you know,
whatever it is.

1030
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,200
It mostly,
it's just people who have this a really 

1031
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,861
smart way to avoid getting healthier or,
or the learning curve associated with 

1032
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:51,670
getting healthier and it's a really 
intelligent trick to play on yourself,

1033
00:49:51,671 --> 00:49:52,690
which is,
do imagine that,

1034
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:59,150
you know,
whatever it may be that's currently out 

1035
00:49:59,150 --> 00:49:59,410
of balance in your life.
If you remove that,

1036
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,500
you're not going to be able to be as 
good as person.

1037
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:07,530
You know?
There's a lot of alcoholics out there 

1038
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:07,530
who are performers who think,
oh,

1039
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:12,391
if I don't drink,
I got to have a beer on stage man or 

1040
00:50:12,391 --> 00:50:16,780
early.
Where it gets hard core is when it's 

1041
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,771
like actually fucking wrapped up in the 
art publicly.

1042
00:50:20,201 --> 00:50:25,201
Like,
I don't know if you're aware of this 

1043
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:26,230
rapper who died named Lil peep,
you know,

1044
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,040
about little peep I heard about him.

1045
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:33,190
Yeah.
And one of his videos that just shows 

1046
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,230
like the,
the floor of his car,

1047
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:35,900
the f just pill bottles scattered 
everywhere.

1048
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,330
Right.
So like part of the identity,

1049
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:43,331
he,
he was projecting into the world 

1050
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,640
involved like the Romanticization of 
addiction to pharmaceutical medications.

1051
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:48,470
Right.
And so that's where it gets real.

1052
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,500
Or like big comics when all their jokes 
are about being fat and if they.

1053
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,050
So they,
they don't only have to like,

1054
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,110
worry about like,
you know,

1055
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:05,111
being fat,
they have to worry about if I got 

1056
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:07,271
healthy,
I don't know if my jokes are gonna work 

1057
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:07,271
anymore.
So you know what I mean?

1058
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:09,680
It's like that's,
that's how insidious it can get,

1059
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:10,540
you know?
Yeah.

1060
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:11,060
That's great.

1061
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,840
Good one.
That one does creep in.

1062
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,780
I actually heard Kevin James,
I heard someone say that to him,

1063
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,520
you lose weight,
you're losing roles.

1064
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,520
God.
Someone just told me,

1065
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:24,521
it's like you either need to lose 15 
pounds or gain 15 pounds if you want to 

1066
00:51:24,591 --> 00:51:28,720
get in the movie.
I don't remember he said that,

1067
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,060
but it's like,
yeah,

1068
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,250
it's like you know,
you,

1069
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:31,650
you,
you,

1070
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:36,651
you're,
you become this character or something 

1071
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:38,981
like that in the next thing you know,
you're fucking addiction is just riding 

1072
00:51:38,981 --> 00:51:43,631
you around like a horse whispering in 
your ear without me will know where to 

1073
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:45,940
go and now you're fucked.
You're fucked.

1074
00:51:45,941 --> 00:51:47,540
Yeah.
I'm your comfort blanket.

1075
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

1076
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:51,890
Like you're all alone.
When you're drinking alone in your hotel

1077
00:51:51,891 --> 00:51:52,600
room.
Woo.

1078
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,610
Dark.
That's dark.

1079
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:58,310
But then when you get into it too,
when you're not just drinking alone,

1080
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:00,810
but you're like telling stories to 
yourself,

1081
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,540
celebrating it.
You're pretending.

1082
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:07,560
Anytime you find yourself pretending 
you're fucking hunter.

1083
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:10,870
S Thompson,
baby,

1084
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,180
get a cigarette holder unless you're 
writing like him.

1085
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,590
You ain't hunter s Thompson.
All right.

1086
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,770
You're having fun.
No doubt.

1087
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,320
But I know in my life like the Times 
where I've been like,

1088
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:24,450
it's of like a hunter,
s Thompson.

1089
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:25,470
It's like,
dude,

1090
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:27,130
you need to go to bed.
Yeah.

1091
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,110
Like stop.
You're like you,

1092
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:29,550
you,
you,

1093
00:52:29,551 --> 00:52:31,050
you're,
you're tricking yourself.

1094
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,330
Now you know,
that's.

1095
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,990
I'll just don't trick yourself.
By the way,

1096
00:52:33,991 --> 00:52:37,290
if you want to be a self destructive 
alcoholic,

1097
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:39,390
drug addict,
whatever it is,

1098
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:45,110
be that thing,
but don't fool yourself into thinking 

1099
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:46,320
that's not what you're doing.
It's romantic.

1100
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:47,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

1101
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,690
Don't like as your plummeting towards 
splattering all over the fucking ground.

1102
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,150
Pretend that you're flying towards the 
earth.

1103
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,440
Well,
maybe you could.

1104
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:59,280
Maybe that's actually a cool way to tie.
That's a good way to think

1105
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,270
right before impact.
Maybe that's the water tower.

1106
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:02,750
God did.

1107
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,350
Yeah.
Dude.

1108
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:05,100
Maybe so

1109
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:10,650
in who knows what you see when you do 
eight days of Iowasca who know what you 

1110
00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:15,790
see?
That seems like eight days of any potent

1111
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:17,560
psychedelic.
I've never done that.

1112
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,150
I've never done more than one day in a 
row.

1113
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,700
I've done one day in a row,
take a break,

1114
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:27,390
maybe a little pot the next day,
and then I don't do anything for like 

1115
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:27,390
months.

1116
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:31,670
That's how I've always done it.
I've never done like a big session 

1117
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,260
followed by big session.
Yeah.

1118
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:34,920
Yeah.
I know.

1119
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:39,921
We can only speculate.
I don't know exactly what that would be 

1120
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:39,921
like.
I mean,

1121
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:40,650
I can imagine.
I couldn't imagine.

1122
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,190
Dude,
I had this crazy idea,

1123
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,320
crazy idea.
Now this is a lens,

1124
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:49,110
I don't know if it's true or not,
but obviously it's probably not true,

1125
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:53,370
but I got this crazy idea that like,
and again,

1126
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:58,371
like this with you,
I could just say this and I don't have 

1127
00:53:58,371 --> 00:53:59,090
to preface it,
but since people isn't your podcasts,

1128
00:53:59,091 --> 00:54:02,400
I have to preface it by saying I do not 
believe this.

1129
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:06,300
I'm not going insane,
but this is a fun thing to think about.

1130
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,140
You know,
it's okay to imagine shit in your mind.

1131
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,660
It's okay.
Like you can imagine stuff.

1132
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:16,260
But.
So I was thinking like inspiration,

1133
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:16,830
right?

1134
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:21,450
Specifically I was thinking like Jr 
Tolkien when you read Lord of the Rings,

1135
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:26,490
it's like that guy went over there that 
writing is so beautiful and so perfect.

1136
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:30,910
And so like interdimensional extra 
dimension old.

1137
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,350
It's fucking old book and it's 
beautiful.

1138
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:35,140
His writing.
Yeah.

1139
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:40,420
I was thinking,
Oh that guy token that inspiration is 

1140
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,330
outflow from the DMT realm into this 
dimension through the,

1141
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:50,810
um,
through the processor of his meat 

1142
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:54,291
computer.
And this is like a kind of drip coming 

1143
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,591
out of a dam.
The dam is something that's been 

1144
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:02,961
constructed by power structures who want
to keep that realm out of here.

1145
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:08,580
Right?
And so over there you get usually a kind

1146
00:55:08,581 --> 00:55:10,260
of message,
right?

1147
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:13,110
And the message is usually something 
along the lines of,

1148
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,560
we need to love each other.
We can love each other here.

1149
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:21,450
There's something more important than 
money,

1150
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,870
uh,
to really be very reductive about it,

1151
00:55:24,871 --> 00:55:29,871
but some version of that story that 
usually involves some kind of desire to 

1152
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:36,291
no longer harm people or to reduce 
suffering or to be a better person or 

1153
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:36,291
however you want to put it.

1154
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:40,940
Right?
So there's a dam that's been built and 

1155
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:45,591
the dam is built by the people who scan 
your pis for Lsd.

1156
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:52,580
It's people who have created an 
intentional legal obstruction between 

1157
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:59,271
one realm and the other,
which is the realm mechanical hyperspace

1158
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,770
in the realm that we're currently 
existing in,

1159
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:05,790
which is where there's a lot of 
scientific materialism where people only

1160
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:08,730
believe that there is only matter here.
There's only matter.

1161
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:09,900
That's it.
There's nothing else.

1162
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:11,490
No spirit,
no soul,

1163
00:56:11,491 --> 00:56:14,300
right gatekeepers.
The gatekeepers I,

1164
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:15,990
I've been,
I used to think of them as gatekeepers.

1165
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:18,750
Now I think of them as dam builders,
builders,

1166
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:23,810
and what happens is from time to time,
a big crack in the dam opens up,

1167
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:29,160
right?
That's when someone like fucking Martin 

1168
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,880
Luther King appears in his standing in 
front of so many people telling them.

1169
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:40,020
I think that we're all the same,
is what I think.

1170
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:44,560
I think we're all the same and he's 
doing it in this very charismatic,

1171
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:45,820
beautiful way,
right?

1172
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,720
That's a big fucking crack in the dam 
because over on this side of things,

1173
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:57,090
they don't want us to be all the same.
They want us to be separated by a lot of

1174
00:56:57,791 --> 00:57:02,791
different fucking things.
They don't want us to be all the same 

1175
00:57:02,791 --> 00:57:05,311
over here.
So the cracks in the dam opened up and 

1176
00:57:05,311 --> 00:57:05,311
the big cracks,
Bam.

1177
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:08,580
The little cracks.
They're like the good art,

1178
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:11,160
the good poetry,
the great movies,

1179
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:16,270
the good inspiration,
and now what's happening because of the 

1180
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,520
fucking Internet is,
Oh,

1181
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:20,280
these fucking cracks in the dam or 
opening up.

1182
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:25,490
They can't seal them up anymore.
It's like you can't see all the fucking 

1183
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:28,611
damn anymore in the singularity that 
Mckenna was talking about the 

1184
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:32,691
apocalypse,
which actually means lifting of the 

1185
00:57:32,691 --> 00:57:32,691
veil.
What did that is,

1186
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,760
is when the dam reaches a point where 
the structural integrity has been 

1187
00:57:38,191 --> 00:57:41,160
permanently compromised in the DMT 
realm,

1188
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:46,310
flows into this dimension in the form of
some kind of technology that either 

1189
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:52,550
unifies all of us are like rips a hole 
literally into whatever that membrane is

1190
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:58,410
that separates us from the infinite,
and that is what for whatever reason,

1191
00:57:58,771 --> 00:58:02,130
over in this dimension,
people have been trying to stop so

1192
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:05,240
because it impedes progress in terms of 
like making money.

1193
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:11,010
We're building businesses.
You can't be building businesses if 

1194
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:12,380
people were doing lsd on their brakes.
I don't think that's true.

1195
00:58:12,381 --> 00:58:13,820
I think you could run a wonderful 
business.

1196
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:14,270
No,
no,

1197
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:19,271
no.
They're going to come back and they're 

1198
00:58:19,271 --> 00:58:19,271
not going to be concerned with 
productivity.

1199
00:58:19,271 --> 00:58:19,271
Well,
they're not going to be.

1200
00:58:19,271 --> 00:58:19,271
No,
no,

1201
00:58:19,271 --> 00:58:20,840
no.
If we get a group of people together and

1202
00:58:20,841 --> 00:58:23,720
start building something amazing,
not for money.

1203
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,970
Oh No.
I'm just being facetious.

1204
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,740
Certainly can be done.
I'm,

1205
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,600
I'm,
I'm arguing with the devil's advocate.

1206
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:30,310
What?
Okay.

1207
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,760
Let me play the devil.
Okay,

1208
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:33,340
nice to meet you.
Finally,

1209
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,120
can I have my soul back?
No.

1210
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:40,620
Dammit.
This whole thing of you exploring hyper 

1211
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:44,911
dimensional space and all that stuff,
all that does is make you stupider and 

1212
00:58:44,911 --> 00:58:49,471
you show up at work and you,
you're less disciplined and you're not 

1213
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:49,960
interested in getting the job done.
Okay.

1214
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,770
This company is built on teamwork.
Okay?

1215
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:55,540
And it's built on everyone pulling their
weight.

1216
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:00,720
Now,
if you're off fucking off in hyperspace 

1217
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,900
from Friday night to Sunday morning and 
you barely get six hours sleep over the 

1218
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,350
weekend and you show up Monday,
I'm going to test your pis.

1219
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,090
Okay?
Yeah,

1220
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:11,590
and if I find silicide been in there or 
anything else fucking squirrely.

1221
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:15,700
Do you mind if I show you David Nuts?
Professor David Nutt,

1222
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:19,850
study on the landsat about the dangers 
of the variety of drugs I,

1223
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,070
I'd like I'm talking to the devil here.
Do

1224
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,920
you mind if I show you this?
Because if you notice sir,

1225
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,160
on this chart,
they again published in the landsat is 

1226
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,370
peer reviewed.
This is a very important study,

1227
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:32,930
Professor David Knight,
of course,

1228
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:37,931
has since been disbarred and somewhere 
and accrued some kind of horrible 

1229
00:59:37,931 --> 00:59:40,250
punishment for being an advocate for 
psychedelics.

1230
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:41,690
But anyway,
sir,

1231
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,760
forgive me,
but if you'll,

1232
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:47,830
you'll notice on this chart,
psilocybin is considered the least 

1233
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:51,140
harmful of mind.
All three candidates

1234
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:52,260
interested in harmful.
Sir.

1235
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:57,180
I'm interested in productivity.
I want this place to run fast.

1236
00:59:57,181 --> 00:59:59,880
We're in competition and we're losing 
jobs overseas.

1237
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Do you know they're going to start to 
make Harley motherfucking Davidson 

1238
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,370
motorcycles in Thailand?
Yes sir.

1239
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:06,840
Yeah.
What kind of Shit is that?

1240
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:11,370
I know it's a goddamn American bike and 
they're making it over in fucking Asia.

1241
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:16,430
Why?
Because the people in the factory over 

1242
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:16,430
here didn't kick ass.
Okay.

1243
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:21,120
They're over in the fucking park taking 
their magic mushrooms and trip and balls

1244
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:24,100
when they should be thinking about how 
they keep this company active.

1245
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,870
This company feeds and houses 150 
families.

1246
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:28,970
You understand that?
Yes.

1247
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,560
Or how it's 100.
Are you happy now?

1248
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,020
You still want to fucking raise serve 
before I forget,

1249
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:36,540
I picked up your prescription for 
oxycodone,

1250
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:41,100
Oxycontin fucker.
I'll take it on their oxygen.

1251
01:00:41,101 --> 01:00:41,700
Bullshit.

1252
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,880
Yeah.
Your extra postage.

1253
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:44,540
Yeah.
You're on adderall.

1254
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:45,800
You're methamphetamine.
Yeah.

1255
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,060
One hundred percent.
So yeah.

1256
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:47,840
Right.
So.

1257
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,180
So D'evelyn,
devil lab.

1258
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:49,670
So.
Right.

1259
01:00:49,671 --> 01:00:53,720
So the answer to it is that I'm talking 
to you.

1260
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:56,030
Oh,
well here's the problem sir.

1261
01:00:56,031 --> 01:01:00,620
You don't realize this,
but you're kind of a low level priest in

1262
01:01:00,621 --> 01:01:05,621
a,
in a religion that is spread far and 

1263
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:07,820
wide and in this religion it's not 
really the,

1264
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,880
the,
the money that you're interested in as 

1265
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,461
much as it is the power because you have
become a servant of a being called the 

1266
01:01:15,461 --> 01:01:20,351
demiurge,
which is essentially attempting to 

1267
01:01:20,351 --> 01:01:24,100
create as sort of authoritarian 
hierarchy in this particular dimension 

1268
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:28,931
that's been separated from another place
known as the galactic.

1269
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:31,730
You can call it whatever the fuck you 
want,

1270
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:36,731
but it's the aliens.
It's a galactic civilization that is 

1271
01:01:36,731 --> 01:01:40,601
about to pour into this civilization and
so it really doesn't matter what you do 

1272
01:01:41,211 --> 01:01:46,211
because within the next 20 or 30 years 
through technology and through the 

1273
01:01:46,211 --> 01:01:48,740
unification of people because of the 
fact that technology,

1274
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:52,520
you're gonna either come to our site or 
go completely insane.

1275
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:58,450
Okay.
The counter to that of course is the 

1276
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:00,611
only way you're gonna get there.
You fucking lazy hippies because if we 

1277
01:02:00,611 --> 01:02:05,201
make you go to work and we get shit done
and you buy things and you keep this 

1278
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:07,280
fucking country's economy healthy that 
way.

1279
01:02:07,281 --> 01:02:11,390
The technology innovators,
that way we make the hyperspace gateway.

1280
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:15,380
You Lazy fucking hippies tripping balls 
on your lawn furniture.

1281
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:17,270
You're not creating shit.
Okay.

1282
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,130
You show up for work on time.
You get the job done.

1283
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:21,180
Eventually we'll get our portal.

1284
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,360
Well,
it sounds okay.

1285
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:25,120
Can I address something you just said 
Satan?

1286
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:26,650
Yes.
On time.

1287
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:30,900
Now this is a very funny term.
Thank God I'm reading David grave the.

1288
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,770
Here's a great term on time.
Right?

1289
01:02:32,771 --> 01:02:35,260
So like boss,
the.

1290
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:40,350
The problem is that like the thing 
you're doing with time are being on 

1291
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:44,281
time.
That's a relatively new imposition into 

1292
01:02:44,281 --> 01:02:46,000
society and it started with clock 
towers.

1293
01:02:46,001 --> 01:02:49,600
During the industrial revolution,
they'd put clock towers up so the people

1294
01:02:49,601 --> 01:02:54,601
always knew what time it was,
so they wouldn't be late for going to 

1295
01:02:54,601 --> 01:02:55,420
work in a.
In a factory.

1296
01:02:55,421 --> 01:03:00,421
You see,
there was a time when people weren't 

1297
01:03:00,421 --> 01:03:04,290
like obsessed with their fucking watch 
because the idea that you could sell 

1298
01:03:04,421 --> 01:03:05,980
time,
here's what it is,

1299
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:10,981
sir.
You think you and I have entered into a 

1300
01:03:10,981 --> 01:03:13,231
contract where for some ridiculous 
reason I've agreed to sell you eight 

1301
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:14,080
hours of time.

1302
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:19,080
My time per day.
It's essentially a form of slavery.

1303
01:03:19,331 --> 01:03:24,331
It's a kind of like slavery,
except I get to go free for a certain 

1304
01:03:24,331 --> 01:03:25,840
amount of hours per week into servitude.
Yeah,

1305
01:03:25,841 --> 01:03:29,050
we can call it that with like less of 
the power.

1306
01:03:29,051 --> 01:03:31,150
I can leave anytime I want indentured 
servants.

1307
01:03:31,151 --> 01:03:36,151
I don't think they could because they 
were kind of trapped until they paid a 

1308
01:03:36,151 --> 01:03:37,260
certain.
Certain jobs are contract will,

1309
01:03:37,261 --> 01:03:42,261
you could quit most jobs.
I mean that's kind of the 

1310
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:42,261
rationalization that people use is 
they're like,

1311
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:44,710
you can leave anytime you want bud in 
anytime you want.

1312
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:49,720
The hard jobs are those jobs where 
people work for salary and their time is

1313
01:03:50,151 --> 01:03:52,610
just whatever the project takes.
Like.

1314
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,710
Do you ever talk to so many worse on 
video games?

1315
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:57,160
Right now I've.
I've met very few people.

1316
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:57,800
I mean,
I met a few,

1317
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:02,801
but it's like they don't work in the big
companies do the hours that they put in 

1318
01:04:03,261 --> 01:04:05,480
before a video game is released is 
insane.

1319
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:10,500
Right?
A lot of them just sleep in the offices 

1320
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:10,850
to work in 16 hours a day.
Just coding.

1321
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:15,200
They're all living on top of each other.
A brutal,

1322
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:16,790
brutal,

1323
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,000
brutal.
Yeah.

1324
01:04:18,001 --> 01:04:19,210
Brutal.
And,

1325
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:19,800
and

1326
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:23,370
this is sounding job.
You're asking for someone's whole life.

1327
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:25,800
That's right.
You're asking for the whole life.

1328
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,590
You occasionally can get away from me 
and go camping.

1329
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:32,040
You occasionally get away from me.
Have a picnic with your family.

1330
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:33,480
You wish.
Usually you can get away,

1331
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,110
but for many,
many months I want you all the time.

1332
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:42,140
I just want you there all the time.
And in exchange I'll give you some 

1333
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:42,140
money.
So like

1334
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:45,630
conceptually I don't think that this is 
like a terrible situation as long as the

1335
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:48,360
person is really into what they're 
doing.

1336
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:53,540
Right?
And then what we have is just kind of 

1337
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:53,540
like a,
um,

1338
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:58,670
I guess you could say what a capitalist 
commune or I don't know what you'd call 

1339
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:03,061
it.
It's like a group of people commuting 

1340
01:05:03,061 --> 01:05:03,780
together as seeking to like extract 
money from the universe,

1341
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,720
but also like,
you know what comes to mind?

1342
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,420
Sorry,
anyone from blizzard who's listening you

1343
01:05:09,421 --> 01:05:11,330
like doesn't like your job there,
but I got to.

1344
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:16,580
I went to on this tour of blizzard and 
they fucking every company that makes 

1345
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,590
video games,
they make the

1346
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:23,040
best video games outside of like the 
only game I notch up with it right now 

1347
01:05:23,561 --> 01:05:25,270
I'm in the god of war,
so fucking good.

1348
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:27,610
But it looks pretty bad ass.
It is amazing.

1349
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:32,700
It is amazing dude.
It's the first triple a game I've liked 

1350
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:34,330
in so long.
What's a aaa?

1351
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,490
Is it?
It's called AAA.

1352
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:37,900
Aaa.
It's a really expensive game to make.

1353
01:05:37,901 --> 01:05:40,090
It's like,
it's like a hardcore big time.

1354
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,850
Pull up a video.
God,

1355
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,010
it's so graphics are pretty fucking 
incredible,

1356
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,270
dude.
Dude.

1357
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,580
It's beautiful.
Don't get me.

1358
01:05:48,581 --> 01:05:50,830
Get fucked.
That alien damn bullshit.

1359
01:05:50,831 --> 01:05:54,490
God award is like.
It's so good man.

1360
01:05:54,491 --> 01:05:56,100
And like I'm stuck in it.
Right?

1361
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:58,740
Put on the HTC Vive today.
The new one that we.

1362
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:04,110
You didn't get into a game yet.
There's some games in it where you're 

1363
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:04,110
just like,
Whoa,

1364
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:05,740
I see where this is going and I saw that
from yours from,

1365
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,240
but yours was when I was over at your 
place.

1366
01:06:08,241 --> 01:06:10,280
What was that?
Two or three years ago,

1367
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:14,330
two years ago.
Look how good the good that is.

1368
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:19,460
He can see like the dirt on his hands.
It's like you're watching an episode of 

1369
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:19,460
Viking Dude.
It's really good and it's.

1370
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:22,460
And it's like bitch ass fucking thing 
freezing up again.

1371
01:06:22,461 --> 01:06:24,770
Here it goes.
So this is actual gameplay.

1372
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,890
See Why is this fucking game play?
Dude?

1373
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,630
That's gameplay.
That's gameplay.

1374
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:31,200
That's amazing.
Yeah,

1375
01:06:31,201 --> 01:06:33,200
it's incredible.
It's amazing.

1376
01:06:33,201 --> 01:06:34,850
She's so hot.
Very hot.

1377
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:39,980
I think you could hang out with the 
trick was like cut people's heads off a 

1378
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:39,980
sorts.
Yes,

1379
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,400
absolutely.
Look at her,

1380
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:50,910
look at him rather her fucking bad dude.
What's great about this game is not just

1381
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:56,290
like the graphics which are incredible 
or the fight mechanics,

1382
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:01,320
which are also incredible,
but the fucking story is really good and

1383
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:06,631
the acting is really good and like the 
relationships between characters are 

1384
01:07:06,631 --> 01:07:11,161
really intense.
This game will make you like tear up 

1385
01:07:11,161 --> 01:07:11,480
man.
Like it's like fucking,

1386
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:14,620
we should see what he just did.
Chop that dude and half with an ax.

1387
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:19,060
Holy Fuck Up.
Is this got smashed by a smashed.

1388
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,370
He gets smashed a lot,
but he's created us.

1389
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,050
The God of war.
He doesn't give a fuck.

1390
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:26,720
Does not give a fuck man.
That's incredible.

1391
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,930
Wouldn't even show much more of this.
It's spoilers.

1392
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:33,931
I don't want anybody to see any of the 
characters or to know what's happening 

1393
01:07:33,931 --> 01:07:34,390
because it's that good.
Like it's such a good game.

1394
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:36,880
Most Games,
the way I've played video games is I try

1395
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:40,300
to rush through it for some reason,
which is really dumb to be like,

1396
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:41,440
oh,
I got to win this thing,

1397
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,190
this one you want to hang out,
look around,

1398
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,580
see the landscape.
And like you get really into it.

1399
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:54,610
It's a glorious game.
But you know that to get back to where 

1400
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:55,930
you're talking about it.
Blizzard,

1401
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:58,400
uh,
one,

1402
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:03,490
one of the people working there told me,
we like building world of warcraft 

1403
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:08,050
because we liked playing world of 
warcraft.

1404
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:13,330
We've created a dimension we want to be 
inside of like we enjoy it,

1405
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,230
they love it.
And,

1406
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:20,240
and that's why the game is so good 
because it's being made by people who 

1407
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,340
enjoy playing the game.
So I don't know how many hours they work

1408
01:08:22,341 --> 01:08:23,510
at blizzard.
I imagine it's,

1409
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:27,890
it can be pretty brutal schedule,
but in anything you do,

1410
01:08:27,891 --> 01:08:30,350
even things you love I know become 
grueling,

1411
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:35,351
but I think that example of a company 
versus a company where you're like 

1412
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:41,770
either doing something that you don't 
even need to be there to do or no 

1413
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:42,980
comparison,
no comparison.

1414
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:48,590
I mean it might be massive hours a day,
but I bet you're having a great time a 

1415
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,370
lot of the time and the actual results 
and saying,

1416
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:55,610
you know,
I was friends with a lot of those guys 

1417
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:56,760
from id software back in the quick two 
days and played quake three.

1418
01:08:56,761 --> 01:08:59,220
I got to play quake three before it ever
came up with you.

1419
01:08:59,221 --> 01:09:02,140
We are trying.
That's Dallas Clif.

1420
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:04,260
No,
Clif Eeb.

1421
01:09:04,261 --> 01:09:09,261
He's soft software as doom and quake.
Cliff Eby is unreal.

1422
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,720
Oh No,
I was with you and cliff.

1423
01:09:11,721 --> 01:09:14,480
He began to her.
I didn't see the quake two as well.

1424
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:16,400
Both amazing.
But we.

1425
01:09:16,401 --> 01:09:21,401
Yeah,
we got to see unreal tournament when 

1426
01:09:21,401 --> 01:09:24,410
they were putting that together and they
were putting together this new engine 

1427
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,380
that will not being used in a bunch of 
different games afterwards,

1428
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:30,410
but it was fucking crazy.
We get to see the graphics like as 

1429
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:32,190
they're designing things and same thing 
with the quakes studios,

1430
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:36,830
but those guys all were crazy gamer so 
they would get land parties and sync all

1431
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
we played at the ID software.
We got to play death matches between 

1432
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,381
everybody in the studio.
It was awesome to play quake with the 

1433
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:46,480
guys who made quake.
Fucking cool,

1434
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:48,420
funny shit.
I've fucking cool man.

1435
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:53,660
And you know,
I mean what they did was if you've never

1436
01:09:54,181 --> 01:09:58,200
played one of those games before,
the three dimensional games,

1437
01:09:58,201 --> 01:10:01,590
when you're running down,
you hear things over here behind you and

1438
01:10:01,591 --> 01:10:02,850
you like you,
you know,

1439
01:10:02,851 --> 01:10:07,851
you could turn around and sneak around 
corners and people are chasing around 

1440
01:10:07,851 --> 01:10:11,721
the map and sometimes you could walk and
it doesn't make any noise or you could 

1441
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:12,720
run and you can hear the footsteps.
Fucking cool as fuck.

1442
01:10:12,721 --> 01:10:15,470
It's the crazy.
This is so adrenaline packed when you're

1443
01:10:15,471 --> 01:10:17,070
playing this game.
So these guys,

1444
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:22,670
I'm so terrified.
We're putting a land in here in the next

1445
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:23,340
couple of weeks.
Now you are.

1446
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:24,170
Oh,
we're going to.

1447
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,560
You and I were going to have some fun.

1448
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:26,150
Well,
no,

1449
01:10:26,151 --> 01:10:28,220
we're not because you're going to be me 
at fucking quake.

1450
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:29,490
I suck at shooter's.
Dude.

1451
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:32,930
Played in forever please and played for 
ever.

1452
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:37,870
I'll probably be terrible for the first 
16 hours if I like.

1453
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:42,410
Had a shrink ray and shrunk you like 
into like an eight year old.

1454
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,830
You would still beat me at shooters.
I suck at fucking shooters,

1455
01:10:45,831 --> 01:10:46,820
man.
I was your thing.

1456
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,510
What do you like?
You liked those a roleplay say at dude,

1457
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:53,030
because you're going to make fun of me.
I won't do it on.

1458
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:54,950
I like hearthstone.
Man.

1459
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:58,050
Was that.
I don't even know what it is.

1460
01:10:58,051 --> 01:11:00,410
Fucking fell for it.
He didn't fall for it.

1461
01:11:00,411 --> 01:11:02,750
I'm being sincere.
I don't know what it is in mine.

1462
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:07,400
Fantasy card game.
It's like a furry thing like furries.

1463
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:12,350
I love comedians seminar because it's 
like I knew you were going to insult me.

1464
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,040
I just didn't know

1465
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:18,740
how and like it's way the way you did.
It was way worse than I expected.

1466
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,330
Thank you.
Pretend to be a Fox,

1467
01:11:21,331 --> 01:11:22,560
right?
Fox Kin.

1468
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,920
Are you?
Other than you,

1469
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:28,970
other kids get a kick out of it.
Do you ever do it in your footie 

1470
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:33,351
pajamas?
Like a little bunny rabbit tail on 

1471
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:38,130
either the woods and I'm a rabid dog.
Fuck man.

1472
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:41,430
I've got to be clever to get away from 
the joint.

1473
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,680
Say,
let me tell you something.

1474
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:48,450
It's a wonderful fucking game with and 
it's deep and it's got a lot of strategy

1475
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:50,610
and I and I and I love playing it,
man.

1476
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:52,980
I really do.
I'm not good at anymore.

1477
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:58,010
I went through a period of being good.
I haven't played it in awhile because 

1478
01:11:58,010 --> 01:11:58,500
I've been playing God of war,
but Oh,

1479
01:11:58,501 --> 01:11:59,430
look at this.
Is this it?

1480
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:01,920
Yeah.
This looks like death.

1481
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:06,000
What is happening?
What is happening here?

1482
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,010
Let's see your cards.
Yeah,

1483
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:10,380
they're cards.
You basically like the.

1484
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,110
I'm not going to explain the rules.
A hearthstone on your show dude,

1485
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:18,111
but those don't.
Great Games is killing me.

1486
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:21,180
It's a great.
It's a great,

1487
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:23,510
very fun,
very enjoyable game,

1488
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:26,100
good game for nine year old girls.
That's what it looks like.

1489
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,330
Get it for my kid and I'm just thinking 
like,

1490
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:31,950
ah,
to do is say star craft or I could ally,

1491
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:34,840
but I knew I had to tell you the truth,
but I knew you were addicted that

1492
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:39,940
you got a real problem with that for 
while you and I met each other in our 

1493
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:40,660
video game.
Addictive tendency.

1494
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:44,430
We're both like,
yeah,

1495
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:45,390
gotTa be careful.

1496
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:46,810
But Dude,
you know this.

1497
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,590
This is something I was thinking I 
wanted to bring up during the podcast.

1498
01:12:49,591 --> 01:12:54,591
Man.
It's like when we first started hanging 

1499
01:12:54,591 --> 01:12:56,361
out and you told me something I've never
gotten in.

1500
01:12:56,581 --> 01:13:01,581
It's from the book of five rings by Mia 
Motto Musashi and you mentioned 

1501
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:11,511
something from that book which is that 
learn one thing and you will know how to

1502
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:16,830
do a lot of other stuff.
Right?

1503
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,840
So he would,
uh,

1504
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:21,210
apparently he would,
um,

1505
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:26,820
he was a Samurai and so he recommended 
for Samurai not just to learn the sword,

1506
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,610
but to learn poetry,
learn how to paint,

1507
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:34,820
learn how to do this step.
Because in the metta process of 

1508
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:34,820
learning,
you learn,

1509
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:39,710
you like you,
there's something in there that like 

1510
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:39,990
fits onto all forms of learning.
Right?

1511
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:41,380
Well,
you don't want to be too hard,

1512
01:13:41,381 --> 01:13:45,700
but you don't want to be too soft.
You want to be a balance right in,

1513
01:13:45,701 --> 01:13:46,720
in a balance,
you must.

1514
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:50,860
You have to be artistic and destructive.
You have to be loving and hating.

1515
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:51,900
You know,
he,

1516
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,510
he played games with his opponents like 
he didn't just fight.

1517
01:13:55,511 --> 01:13:56,290
No,
billy,

1518
01:13:56,620 --> 01:14:01,620
he was an asshole.
He would show up hours late for duals 

1519
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:01,850
and make the guy wait.
Oh,

1520
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:07,170
say knew the guy would be freaking out.
He would show up sometimes with wooden 

1521
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:07,420
swords instead of metal swords to fuck 
with their heads.

1522
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,550
One time he whittled a sword out of an 
or of the boat that he,

1523
01:14:11,551 --> 01:14:15,130
he rode over to the beach where you're 
supposed to have the sword fight.

1524
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:16,870
Showed up hours late.
Fuck Dude.

1525
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:19,500
Up with an or.
Yeah,

1526
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:21,300
he would,
he would play games with people.

1527
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,440
I knew that there was psychological 
warfare in him showing up late.

1528
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,400
Right.
You know?

1529
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:27,960
Right.
Yeah.

1530
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,650
And do you remember the first sentence 
of the book?

1531
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:36,420
I do not.
I remember the quote that you just were 

1532
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:36,420
talking about because I say it all the 
time.

1533
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:37,510
It's like the reason why I have this 
tattoo on my arm.

1534
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,730
This is Musashi,
you know,

1535
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:44,110
it's,
once you understand the way broadly or 

1536
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:44,110
once you know the way broadly,
you will see it in all things that.

1537
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:44,330
Yeah.

1538
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:48,060
So,
so which is also a as above.

1539
01:14:48,061 --> 01:14:50,290
So below it's another way of saying that
it's like,

1540
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:53,130
it's.
So it's the concept that uh,

1541
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:55,800
if I practice some things.
Yeah.

1542
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:57,600
For example,
like right now,

1543
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:02,400
like I'm learning how to do modular 
synthesis.

1544
01:15:02,401 --> 01:15:04,630
Like at modular sense,
they're bad ass.

1545
01:15:04,631 --> 01:15:06,300
It's like for making music,
right?

1546
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:09,960
I'm 44.
I'm not like thinking to myself like,

1547
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:15,020
man,
one day I'm going to be fucking based 

1548
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:15,020
factor.
I'm not going to get,

1549
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:15,020
you know what I mean?
I don't,

1550
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:15,230
I don't,
I don't leave.

1551
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:19,590
I'll perform live with them ever.
But I'm,

1552
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:25,280
I,
I got sucked into it and now I'm taking 

1553
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,190
it seriously.
So I'm learning how to do it for real.

1554
01:15:26,191 --> 01:15:31,191
Like,
and then that pulls you into like music 

1555
01:15:31,191 --> 01:15:31,191
theory,
right?

1556
01:15:31,191 --> 01:15:32,160
So now you start looking at,
well what is this song and why does this

1557
01:15:32,161 --> 01:15:37,161
song is a song set up like it is and 
what her notes and what's a tone,

1558
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:39,270
right?

1559
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:41,250
What's an Oscillator,
what are these things?

1560
01:15:41,251 --> 01:15:46,251
And then like from that you get pulled 
into like pythagoras and then suddenly 

1561
01:15:46,321 --> 01:15:51,321
you're like reading like shit by 
Pythagoras who like had another great 

1562
01:15:51,321 --> 01:15:56,211
quote which is do not take the roads 
traveled by the public is pretty 

1563
01:15:56,211 --> 01:15:57,930
awesome,
which means isn't that bad ass?

1564
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:59,850
But um,
but anyway,

1565
01:15:59,851 --> 01:16:04,851
the point is like,
because I've been studying like the 

1566
01:16:04,851 --> 01:16:07,560
modular synthesizer now when I sit down 
and play guitar,

1567
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:12,980
like I'm a little better at it.
But then where it gets fucking weird is 

1568
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:17,060
when I sit down and play like God a war.
I'm a little better at that too.

1569
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:22,070
And then like when I'm thinking about 
cutting tomatoes,

1570
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:27,100
for example,
something really basic and the pressure 

1571
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,130
I'm exerting to cut the tomato versus 
the sharpness of the knife.

1572
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:31,850
I think about music and I think about,
Whoa,

1573
01:16:31,851 --> 01:16:34,850
in a weird way,
my knife is like a,

1574
01:16:34,851 --> 01:16:36,680
this is,
you won't know what this is.

1575
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:41,680
Maybe like my knife is like a CV gate,
which is like if you have a tone,

1576
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:47,010
like a gate might be an on and off,
like a switch that makes the tango will,

1577
01:16:47,881 --> 01:16:48,170
will,
will,

1578
01:16:48,171 --> 01:16:53,171
will,
will blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 

1579
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:53,171
blah.
Right.

1580
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:53,171
So suddenly the shit you're learning 
from like.

1581
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:54,230
And by the way,
synth nerds out there.

1582
01:16:54,231 --> 01:16:56,150
I don't know what I just fucking said.
I fucked it up.

1583
01:16:56,151 --> 01:16:58,430
I'm sorry I'm learning but,
but,

1584
01:16:58,490 --> 01:16:59,270
but the,
the,

1585
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,990
what I'm saying is it's like what he was
saying,

1586
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:05,880
what he was teaching is so powerful,
which is like what?

1587
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:10,890
You don't just get good at one thing it 
into other shit and your wife to sure.

1588
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:16,760
That is an incredible thing for me to 
realize man.

1589
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:19,670
It's been pretty intense because like,
you know,

1590
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:23,480
when you like what you were saying,
you know,

1591
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:25,580
for if you're a 20 year old,
you know,

1592
01:17:25,581 --> 01:17:27,710
people expect you to be learning 
something,

1593
01:17:27,711 --> 01:17:30,110
this or that.
But when you're in your forties,

1594
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,800
you know,
you can trick yourself into thinking 

1595
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:35,800
like,
I don't need to learn how to do anything

1596
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:40,271
anymore.
And then you're basically like turning 

1597
01:17:40,271 --> 01:17:42,860
down all the lights in your life because
when you start working on something,

1598
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:45,300
even this is what I was going to ask 
you,

1599
01:17:45,301 --> 01:17:47,050
and maybe even video games.
Oh,

1600
01:17:47,051 --> 01:17:48,070
for sure.
Video Games,

1601
01:17:48,071 --> 01:17:52,510
do we dismiss them because they were 
thought of as frivolous exercises and we

1602
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:56,830
embrace chess and go and all that.
And even poker because we know that it's

1603
01:17:56,831 --> 01:18:01,831
an intellectual pursuit or real poker 
players are all super fucking smart 

1604
01:18:01,831 --> 01:18:01,831
guys.
The guys that were really good at it.

1605
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,510
Um,
I think that we do that with video games

1606
01:18:04,511 --> 01:18:09,511
because at one point in time they were 
just pong and then they were mario 

1607
01:18:09,511 --> 01:18:10,330
brothers and they were silliness and 
fun.

1608
01:18:10,331 --> 01:18:14,290
You get the mushroom and have a good 
time and PAC man and all that shed.

1609
01:18:14,291 --> 01:18:16,840
But now when you see God at war,
you're like,

1610
01:18:16,841 --> 01:18:20,290
okay,
well clearly your brain is firing on all

1611
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,610
cylinders.
When you're doing that.

1612
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:25,540
You're swinging that acts and switch 
into this sphere and doing this.

1613
01:18:25,541 --> 01:18:30,541
And jumping there and chopping this 
student half and getting away from the 

1614
01:18:30,541 --> 01:18:31,510
guy with the fucking flying logs thrown 
at you.

1615
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,810
That's your brain.
Your brain's firing left and right.

1616
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:37,990
The idea that this is totally useless 
seems stupid.

1617
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

1618
01:18:39,271 --> 01:18:43,320
So I think that that potentially through
anything,

1619
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:48,210
the problem with video games is you can 
play them and actually not get better at

1620
01:18:48,211 --> 01:18:51,300
them because you just like are slashing 
and pressing buttons and Shit.

1621
01:18:51,301 --> 01:18:55,650
Like you have to folk you can focus.
But I think when focus,

1622
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,030
when your attention and focus gets put 
on improving anything,

1623
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:05,040
like I theoretically,
I imagine if you just started working on

1624
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:10,041
drawing a circle or drawing a perfect 
circle and just spent day after day 

1625
01:19:11,211 --> 01:19:14,990
working on that pursuit sounds insane.
Like you'd look crazy,

1626
01:19:14,991 --> 01:19:19,490
dear friends for potentially other shit 
in your life.

1627
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:24,080
You'd start improving at to your mind 
gets a little sharper maybe.

1628
01:19:24,081 --> 01:19:25,200
Maybe it's just some kind of neuro

1629
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:26,640
or something.
I Dunno,

1630
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:29,230
it's exercise.
It's an exercise for your mind for sure.

1631
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:34,270
Your brain is very,
very active when you're playing a video 

1632
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:34,270
game.
You know,

1633
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:34,270
I,
I know what I would play,

1634
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:38,701
quake,
my hands would get so sweaty that I 

1635
01:19:38,701 --> 01:19:40,570
would put antiperspirant on my hands.
I would spray antiperspirant all over my

1636
01:19:40,571 --> 01:19:45,571
hands and then I would blow on them to 
keep them from getting so sweaty because

1637
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:51,630
my fingers would barely.
They would slip around over the 

1638
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:51,910
keyboard.
I leave puddles and keys.

1639
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:57,120
My mouse would get soaking wet.
My it wouldn't be dripping over the 

1640
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,530
mouse pad and the ball would get stuck.
Then eventually became a laser beam,

1641
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:04,710
laser tracking first suck.
Then it got way better for us was like 

1642
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:06,230
you wanted that ball.
He wanted to feel that the ball,

1643
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,000
the mouse because you got that tactile 
sensation,

1644
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:14,340
but then it got to a point where these 
laser ones were so much more accurate 

1645
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:14,690
and they never fuck up.
They just became better.

1646
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:17,280
That shit has always been like really 
odd to me.

1647
01:20:17,281 --> 01:20:22,281
When you look at a gaming mouse and it 
says how precise it is under the DPIS 

1648
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:27,050
DPI.
I remember razer mouse had one that was 

1649
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:29,590
2000 DPI,
the Mamba and it was crazy.

1650
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,800
You play with the thing and be like,
Jesus Christ,

1651
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:36,950
it was so fast.
It was an odd shape like it was a duck 

1652
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:36,950
foot.
Do you remember that?

1653
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:37,850
Yeah.
Stay away to the ones.

1654
01:20:37,851 --> 01:20:38,960
Now you.
There's a button on it.

1655
01:20:38,961 --> 01:20:41,900
You can switch mid game depending on 
what you're doing or what you need.

1656
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:44,390
You can set up your DPI from uptake.
W 8,000,

1657
01:20:44,391 --> 01:20:46,630
10,000,
2000 down to 200.

1658
01:20:46,631 --> 01:20:49,340
100.
Wonder why we made it slower.

1659
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,400
Slower.
There's some games like you,

1660
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:54,910
you don't need to be moving that much.
Might be a sniper,

1661
01:20:54,911 --> 01:20:59,911
so you need very small adjustments and 
you can make big moves with your hands 

1662
01:20:59,911 --> 01:21:00,650
and have still a small adjustment.
Yeah.

1663
01:21:00,651 --> 01:21:02,900
Some guys,
when the adrenaline would kick in,

1664
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:06,460
they would like a slow mouse speed and a
big mouse pad and they moved

1665
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:11,590
pat around like that and they felt more 
precise that way than they were with a 

1666
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:15,290
small pat and a high speed because some 
guys used to like do little wrist flicks

1667
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:17,720
were like super high speed and you would
try their mouse.

1668
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:18,470
He'd be like,
hey man,

1669
01:21:18,471 --> 01:21:23,471
can I try your setback?
Because everybody set was different and 

1670
01:21:23,471 --> 01:21:23,471
I would try their setup of like,
Jesus,

1671
01:21:23,471 --> 01:21:24,300
how do you even concentrate?
This is crazy.

1672
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:29,301
It's you're moving so fast.
They would have their speeches and they 

1673
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,560
would.
Our acceleration mouse accelerations.

1674
01:21:30,561 --> 01:21:32,230
Yeah.
So if you move faster,

1675
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:35,120
it actually goes faster.
Almost like you're throwing a whip.

1676
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:35,550
Yeah,

1677
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:37,930
I know dude.
You need that in starcraft.

1678
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,270
Like you're doing that too.
Oh absolutely.

1679
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:42,280
Yeah.
That's a very important.

1680
01:21:42,281 --> 01:21:47,281
Getting your mouse set at the right 
speed and then you get used to that 

1681
01:21:47,281 --> 01:21:47,320
speed.
So if your mouse is fucked up,

1682
01:21:47,321 --> 01:21:50,110
you're definitely gonna like you're 
gonna make bad decisions.

1683
01:21:50,111 --> 01:21:53,740
But I never got like I got.
Okay.

1684
01:21:53,741 --> 01:21:57,250
It star craft.
I think I got up to like,

1685
01:21:57,370 --> 01:22:02,370
oh no,
maybe silver league or something like 

1686
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:02,370
that.
What does that mean?

1687
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:03,530
So if you were interested,
it's not a big deal.

1688
01:22:03,531 --> 01:22:06,430
Would you have a purple belt belt after 
white belt?

1689
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:08,110
Blue.
What's the one after that?

1690
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:13,140
Purple.
It's probably blue blue belt because 

1691
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:13,140
bronze league is where I stayed for 
ever.

1692
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,400
That's the white belt stage.
Yeah,

1693
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:19,030
mercilessly getting my fucking ass 
handed to me in bronze league.

1694
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:24,060
And then like finally I figured it out a
little bit and for I popped into the 

1695
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:27,901
silver league and then you want to go 
back to the fucking bronze league 

1696
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:32,040
because once you get to the silver lake,
you can't do a fucking early game 

1697
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:34,090
painting rush.
You can't like,

1698
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,800
can't do that.
Fuck no,

1699
01:22:35,801 --> 01:22:38,050
you can't do any of that shit.
And when you try it,

1700
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:43,470
when you try it,
they're gonna like they're gonna make 

1701
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:45,691
fun.
You know they're going to tie it to you 

1702
01:22:45,691 --> 01:22:45,691
like no.
But they're also going to be like,

1703
01:22:45,691 --> 01:22:45,691
what?
Like,

1704
01:22:45,691 --> 01:22:47,950
what are you doing?
You fucking newb fuck you.

1705
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:49,420
Why are you doing that?
Shit,

1706
01:22:49,421 --> 01:22:54,421
I wanted a real game.
You're going to do something like early 

1707
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:54,640
game failing.
Rushed against my.

1708
01:22:55,250 --> 01:23:00,250
You don't want people to get super mad 
when they're fucking connection with 

1709
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:03,161
timeout.
And they would be stuck in the game and 

1710
01:23:03,161 --> 01:23:03,161
you'd fuck them up.
Stuck.

1711
01:23:03,161 --> 01:23:03,600
Frozen.
Oh yeah.

1712
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,710
Just light them up.
You know like

1713
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,980
sometimes you do you use like your 
smallest gun and just slowly pick away 

1714
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:11,670
their house.
Purell Po,

1715
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:12,880
Po,
po.

1716
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:14,830
You Punch him.
When we were in the old quake games,

1717
01:23:14,831 --> 01:23:15,700
you could punch dudes.

1718
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:17,820
Yeah,
yeah.

1719
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,610
There was some video that popped up at 
that new game fortnight.

1720
01:23:20,611 --> 01:23:22,880
Everybody's playing and it's like it was
on Undergrad.

1721
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:27,920
I was like the worst fortnight player 
ever because it's someone who clearly 

1722
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:28,660
got up to go get chips or maybe they 
and,

1723
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:33,750
and the dude's like shooting at them and
can't hit like a still person.

1724
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:37,050
Yeah,
man games are bad ass these days.

1725
01:23:37,051 --> 01:23:38,280
Man.
I really love him,

1726
01:23:38,281 --> 01:23:43,281
but I do like think to myself,
I still am probably just because I'm 

1727
01:23:44,551 --> 01:23:49,551
like an older person.
I do think there's like a hierarchy of 

1728
01:23:49,551 --> 01:23:53,040
like what's good to do and I think it's 
bad for me.

1729
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:55,140
It's bad.
I like learning music right now.

1730
01:23:55,141 --> 01:23:59,760
I like sitting down picking some basic 
thing about music,

1731
01:23:59,761 --> 01:24:01,880
figuring out one little thing about a 
module,

1732
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,920
one of my sense and what it does and 
understanding it and then like unfolding

1733
01:24:08,071 --> 01:24:11,640
that into something bigger and that can 
lead to hours of,

1734
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:16,700
of it.
Whereas like if I sit down and play God 

1735
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,981
of war,
you know that's also going to lead to 

1736
01:24:18,981 --> 01:24:22,251
ours.
But at the end of it I'm going to know 

1737
01:24:22,251 --> 01:24:24,081
more about a story,
whereas the other one I'm going to know 

1738
01:24:24,081 --> 01:24:27,261
a little bit more about math and like 
how sound works in general,

1739
01:24:28,051 --> 01:24:30,770
which is a fascinating thing altogether.
You know?

1740
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:31,980
So I don't know.
What do you think?

1741
01:24:31,981 --> 01:24:34,080
Is there a hierarchy of shit to do?
Like

1742
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:35,300
no,
I don't think there is.

1743
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:39,710
I think there's a hierarchy and elevated
passion levels.

1744
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:45,190
So like what are you passionate about?
Say if you were doing something and you 

1745
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:47,360
know,
you were very apathetic about it,

1746
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:49,880
but then there was this other thing that
you did that once you started,

1747
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:52,700
like for some people of the World Cup 
was on today,

1748
01:24:52,701 --> 01:24:55,910
I went to get a cup of coffee and they 
have the World Cup on and these guys are

1749
01:24:55,911 --> 01:24:58,970
gathering around watching the World Cup.
To me it's just dudes running around.

1750
01:24:58,971 --> 01:25:00,690
I don't know what's going on.
I don't know.

1751
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:01,820
It's fine.
It's great,

1752
01:25:01,821 --> 01:25:04,400
it's good.
But for them it was clearly.

1753
01:25:04,401 --> 01:25:09,401
And for the world,
for all the people watching in the 

1754
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:09,401
stands is an elevated level of passion 
for that.

1755
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:09,650
Now,
if that was your thing,

1756
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:14,651
I would say maybe you can be a 
commentator and maybe you can be a 

1757
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:17,291
player or maybe it could be someone who 
produces one of those soccer shows or 

1758
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:17,291
something like that.

1759
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:20,870
There's just plenty of gigs for that,
but if that's your thing and instead you

1760
01:25:20,871 --> 01:25:23,780
get into shoe sales,
like Al Bundy,

1761
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,600
you know,
after awhile that shit chips away.

1762
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,350
Just not what I like.
What I like is I want to play soccer,

1763
01:25:30,351 --> 01:25:32,870
I want to watch soccer,
I want to talk about soccer,

1764
01:25:32,871 --> 01:25:34,940
I want to commentate on soccer.
Yeah,

1765
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,800
you got to find the thing and that 
yellow gold,

1766
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:40,940
not everybody can commentate on soccer.
Dad is true,

1767
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:44,870
but it's also a loser mentality like 
someone can.

1768
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,720
Not everybody can,
but how many people try?

1769
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:49,430
That's the other thing.
Like people say,

1770
01:25:49,431 --> 01:25:51,110
not everybody can be successful.
Comedian.

1771
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:53,570
You're right.
How many people try though,

1772
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:56,120
right?
Not that many people try.

1773
01:25:56,810 --> 01:26:00,110
A more people could do it then,
then try.

1774
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,140
I think there's a bunch of people out 
there that could.

1775
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:04,070
I always tell you about.
I've told you about this guy,

1776
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:06,950
my friend Dave Dolan,
who is my boss,

1777
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:09,110
he's a private investigator.
When I was a kid,

1778
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:12,800
I got a gig driving him around.
He needed an assistant.

1779
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:18,070
Really?
He got a Dui and they took his license 

1780
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:19,070
away and needed a driver.
He was the funniest guy I've ever met.

1781
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,040
He's right up there with Joe.
He was so funny,

1782
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:23,200
man.
And you know,

1783
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:28,270
not no aspirations for comedy at all.
And his cousin was Billy Downs who was 

1784
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:31,610
one of the owners of the comedy 
connection in Boston.

1785
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:36,880
So his,
his cousin was a former comedian who 

1786
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,841
owned the comedy club and just randomly 
became friends with them from an ad on 

1787
01:26:40,841 --> 01:26:45,830
like one of those newspaper ads for the 
job seeking private investigators 

1788
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:46,260
assistant.
I'm like,

1789
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,530
that sounds like a cool job.
So.

1790
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:51,020
But this guy easily could have been a 
comic,

1791
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,790
like a hundred percent.
Could have been.

1792
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:54,170
Sure.
He's a.

1793
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:59,380
He was a funny fucking dude and he was 
always the guy that has a bunch of 

1794
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,140
people were saying around.
He would say something like,

1795
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:05,200
totally ridiculous looking in the eye 
and say it and everybody would be 

1796
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:05,200
laughing.
It was just natural.

1797
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:08,030
He was just a naturally funny guy.
Just didn't do it.

1798
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,790
Did he liked being a private 
investigator?

1799
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:11,350
Loved it.
Loved it.

1800
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,840
Loved busting people.
Cheaters.

1801
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:17,630
Mostly people who were cheating on their
insurance.

1802
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:19,670
That was mostly.
It was.

1803
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:24,740
There was a few one.
He got one guy who kept asking him to 

1804
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:28,480
take pictures of his girlfriend getting 
fucked by this giant bodybuilder.

1805
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:30,260
Dude after wise like,
hey dude,

1806
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:35,560
enough with this kinky shit.
I'm not giving you any more fucking 

1807
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,860
pictures through attitude.
He's like,

1808
01:27:36,861 --> 01:27:38,990
get the fuck Outta here with this.
He goes like,

1809
01:27:38,991 --> 01:27:40,400
what else do you want,
bro?

1810
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:43,670
I got the pictures that are going to get
more pictures.

1811
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:45,560
You fucking idiot.
That's so funny.

1812
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:51,430
That's so funny that.
Why didn't the guy just hire a 

1813
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:51,430
photographer?
Right.

1814
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:54,581
Well the guy was.
He was just like really wealthy but 

1815
01:27:54,581 --> 01:27:57,080
diminutive.
Very non masculine man.

1816
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:01,820
And he had this bombshell girl that he 
had figured out a way to get a part of.

1817
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:06,920
Yeah,
but she was just getting drilled on the 

1818
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,731
side.
Did she know he was getting pictures 

1819
01:28:09,731 --> 01:28:09,731
taken?
I don't think she did.

1820
01:28:09,731 --> 01:28:10,250
No,
I don't think she's.

1821
01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:12,950
Sounds like,
to me it sounds like a fetish game where

1822
01:28:12,951 --> 01:28:14,000
he's like,
oh,

1823
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:16,070
seems like a.
But I don't think it was.

1824
01:28:16,071 --> 01:28:21,071
I think it was just a weak guy.
Didn't know what to do because they 

1825
01:28:21,071 --> 01:28:23,601
would be on the beach.
He get pictures of him on the beach 

1826
01:28:23,601 --> 01:28:24,080
making out and stuff like he got.
He got enough pictures.

1827
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,670
A lot of these guys.
I mean I don't.

1828
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:26,690
Yeah,
I don't know man.

1829
01:28:26,691 --> 01:28:28,640
I just.
That to me sounds a little bit like,

1830
01:28:28,641 --> 01:28:29,840
well that's what he thought a little 
bit.

1831
01:28:29,841 --> 01:28:31,280
He thought the guy was a little bit of a
freak,

1832
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,750
but at the end of the day he was like,
look,

1833
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:33,860
come on.
You know,

1834
01:28:33,861 --> 01:28:35,570
it was fucking heavy Boston accent,
Bro.

1835
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,300
I got you.
You fucking pictures did make a move.

1836
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:40,060
Right?
Not taking any more.

1837
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:43,820
Clf Sucks.
That's a shit job.

1838
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:46,160
I wouldn't want to do that.
He loved busting people.

1839
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:48,020
That's not his thing.
He didn't really like.

1840
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:50,300
That was rare.
Most of the time he worked for insurance

1841
01:28:50,301 --> 01:28:55,301
companies,
most of the time it's like say if you 

1842
01:28:55,301 --> 01:28:56,720
were married and you were a woman and 
you had a different maiden name,

1843
01:28:56,750 --> 01:29:01,750
you would get injured on the job and 
then you would start using your maiden 

1844
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:03,720
name and take a job on the side while 
you're getting workman's compensation.

1845
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:06,190
So people would get double paid.
Yeah,

1846
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:11,210
and they would have to leave their jobs,
like people would leave their job super 

1847
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:11,670
early in the morning so we would camp 
out in front of people's houses where we

1848
01:29:11,671 --> 01:29:15,060
would get there at 4:00
in the morning when everybody's asleep.

1849
01:29:15,061 --> 01:29:18,690
We'd sit in the car across the street 
and we'd wait sometimes earlier and we'd

1850
01:29:18,691 --> 01:29:23,691
wait and we'd wait and we wait 5:30
roll around and then you'd see some 

1851
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:24,120
light go on and you're like,
he's up,

1852
01:29:24,121 --> 01:29:24,990
he's up,
he's up here.

1853
01:29:24,991 --> 01:29:25,950
He goes,
here he goes,

1854
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:31,020
this motherfucker's going to work and 
this is the guy that's supposed to be 

1855
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:33,621
laid up in bed.
And we catch them like working as a 

1856
01:29:33,621 --> 01:29:36,111
roofer carrying shingles up the ladder 
when they're getting disable a 

1857
01:29:36,111 --> 01:29:37,070
disability insurance.
Yeah.

1858
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:40,170
So that was a really common thing.
Most of it was disability insurance

1859
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:45,540
man.
What a fucked up state of life to get 

1860
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:46,540
into.
Or you're doing insurance fraud.

1861
01:29:46,541 --> 01:29:51,541
Like that's a.
that's a sad existence to like get into 

1862
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:52,890
that spot where you're like,
I'm going to get.

1863
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:54,340
I'm going to give it to them,
man.

1864
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:56,410
I've come up with a scheme,
honey,

1865
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:59,030
you know someone from the comedy store.
I probably can't it

1866
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,790
sometimes.
It's not like that man.

1867
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,440
See,
this is the thing.

1868
01:30:02,441 --> 01:30:06,340
Like it was nice people,
they just didn't know better and I don't

1869
01:30:06,341 --> 01:30:09,340
say that like they're stupid.
I say that like they're just dating.

1870
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:14,350
I think they're going to get caught.
They didn't think it was that big a 

1871
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:14,350
deal.
They didn't think through it very well.

1872
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:17,140
There was one lady was so nice.
She,

1873
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:22,420
he had a scam.
This scam safe your license plate 

1874
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:26,310
number.
He would write down your license plate 

1875
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:27,901
number and then write down one that was 
really close to it and write down 

1876
01:30:27,901 --> 01:30:27,901
another one that was really close to 
that.

1877
01:30:27,901 --> 01:30:29,680
And then he would knock on your door and
he'd say,

1878
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:34,690
I hate to bother you.
But my girlfriend was in a car accident 

1879
01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:38,950
and the police report where they had the
witnesses driver's license number,

1880
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:44,280
a,
some coffee got spilled on the report 

1881
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:44,860
and they don't know exactly what the 
license number is.

1882
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:46,450
There's.
We've checked these two.

1883
01:30:46,451 --> 01:30:49,090
It's not them.
I have a friend who works in the DMV and

1884
01:30:49,091 --> 01:30:51,790
they hooked me up and then you tell her 
an injury.

1885
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:53,020
Oh,
I'm sorry.

1886
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,640
What?
What happened to a showcase?

1887
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:56,620
She's okay,
but she did this.

1888
01:30:56,830 --> 01:30:58,480
Oh my God.
I had that same injury.

1889
01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:03,780
You tell them the injury that they had 
that's giving them Workman's 

1890
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:06,610
compensation and had St.
that's terrible.

1891
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,860
Do you guys want to come in and have a 
cup of coffee?

1892
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:11,050
She invites us in that fucking house.
Strangers.

1893
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:12,820
This is what people did in the eighties,
dude.

1894
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:17,560
They invited people in the house like 
pilgrims these crazy.

1895
01:31:17,561 --> 01:31:22,561
This lady invited two guys into her 
house and he spins or a yarn about his 

1896
01:31:24,101 --> 01:31:27,580
girlfriend being injured and she said I 
had the exact same problem.

1897
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:28,180
And he said,
well,

1898
01:31:28,181 --> 01:31:29,170
what happened?
She said,

1899
01:31:29,171 --> 01:31:34,171
well,
I was on the job as a flight attendant 

1900
01:31:34,171 --> 01:31:34,171
and I fell down and hurt myself,
and he goes,

1901
01:31:34,171 --> 01:31:34,600
Bob,
you getting paid aren't you?

1902
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:35,650
And she goes,
oh,

1903
01:31:35,651 --> 01:31:40,651
not only getting paid,
but I'm also working under my maiden 

1904
01:31:40,651 --> 01:31:40,651
name and another job.
He's like,

1905
01:31:40,651 --> 01:31:41,860
Oh yeah,
great,

1906
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:43,660
great idea.
Way To do it,

1907
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:44,980
lady.
So Nice.

1908
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:46,680
And we got out of there and I was like,
man,

1909
01:31:46,681 --> 01:31:47,890
we can't turn her.
And he's like,

1910
01:31:47,891 --> 01:31:49,840
fuck her.
She goes,

1911
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:53,140
she goes,
she's a fucking crazy.

1912
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,700
He goes,
that lady's a fucking crook.

1913
01:31:54,701 --> 01:31:55,840
I mean,
she's so nice.

1914
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,030
She let us in her house.
She gave us coffee.

1915
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:59,620
That's the car.

1916
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:01,510
I love that Shit,
man.

1917
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:06,600
I like being nice has somehow become 
synonymous with not being dangerous or a

1918
01:32:07,781 --> 01:32:10,150
crook.
That's a really funny thing.

1919
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:15,540
It's like because being nice is like,
that's like a really great costume to 

1920
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:19,471
put on.
Like if you want to camouflage yourself 

1921
01:32:19,471 --> 01:32:22,650
and you're a predator,
you know the way lot the tigers wasn't 

1922
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:22,650
okay.

1923
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:26,760
Predator.
She was just a lady who didn't think it 

1924
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,030
was a big deal to rip off a corporation.
People grow up thinking corporations are

1925
01:32:28,031 --> 01:32:33,031
faceless,
nameless entities and you can extract 

1926
01:32:33,031 --> 01:32:36,301
money from them.
I think that's the way people think of 

1927
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:38,671
some liability lawsuits.
Like you slip on some water in the 

1928
01:32:38,671 --> 01:32:39,060
hallway and a big building.

1929
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:40,480
You fall down like,
oh,

1930
01:32:40,481 --> 01:32:42,460
I'm hurt.
I'm real hurt.

1931
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:46,840
You guys didn't protect me.
My balance was compromised and I fell on

1932
01:32:46,841 --> 01:32:48,340
your ground.
Somebody.

1933
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:51,220
Somebody put some water on your ground.
I'm not responsible for this.

1934
01:32:51,221 --> 01:32:52,080
I'm going to soup soup.
Soup.

1935
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:54,940
It's fucked.
It's bad that,

1936
01:32:54,941 --> 01:32:59,941
that,
that woman was making a terrible 

1937
01:32:59,941 --> 01:32:59,941
mistake.
And your,

1938
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:00,370
um,
your friend Dolan,

1939
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:02,130
dynamite,
dickless Dave Dolan and calm.

1940
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,090
So he helped,
he helped her,

1941
01:33:04,091 --> 01:33:06,510
he helped her,
he helped her out because like that kind

1942
01:33:06,511 --> 01:33:08,380
of shit,
that kind of life like dealing,

1943
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:13,530
you want to create like a,
you want to create a version of that 

1944
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:18,541
woman were like inside.
She didn't feel alone at least a little 

1945
01:33:18,541 --> 01:33:18,850
bad,
a little better,

1946
01:33:18,851 --> 01:33:21,640
a little weak,
a little bit off balance course,

1947
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:26,730
but reality,
the reality is she didn't feel good 

1948
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:27,640
about that probably.
And that's not a great way to live,

1949
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:28,210
man.
And,

1950
01:33:28,211 --> 01:33:32,980
and so by getting corrected by the 
universe in those ways,

1951
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:35,860
you know,
I think it's a good thing.

1952
01:33:35,861 --> 01:33:37,200
I'm glad that,
you know,

1953
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:40,360
some things aren't illegal for example,
but they are,

1954
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:45,420
you know,
like obviously like we agree on some of 

1955
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:45,420
these things,
right?

1956
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:49,320
Those things,
it's fucked up to bus people for if 

1957
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:49,510
you're stealing in,
uh,

1958
01:33:49,511 --> 01:33:49,960
in,
in,

1959
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:51,100
in,
in that,

1960
01:33:51,101 --> 01:33:53,620
in that way.
I don't know man.

1961
01:33:53,650 --> 01:33:54,370
No,
you're right.

1962
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:55,160
No,
you're right.

1963
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:58,140
But I would have never turned around.
I would have said this.

1964
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:03,250
I can't,
that would have never been a good 

1965
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:03,250
private investigator.
I just,

1966
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:07,370
I,
I feel like a lot of those people and I 

1967
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:09,941
was at the time 21 at the time,
at the most 21.

1968
01:34:10,851 --> 01:34:15,851
I think at that time I was really well 
aware of like the,

1969
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:20,960
the neighborhood where my grandparents 
grew up,

1970
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:22,070
right?
Like,

1971
01:34:22,071 --> 01:34:27,071
and,
and being around them and being around 

1972
01:34:27,071 --> 01:34:29,360
my parents who grew up in the sixties 
and then my grandparents who grew up,

1973
01:34:29,550 --> 01:34:34,550
I mean they were,
they were hearing the depression and 

1974
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:36,941
they just,
there was a different attitude about 

1975
01:34:36,941 --> 01:34:36,941
opportunity.
Like everybody was poor.

1976
01:34:36,941 --> 01:34:41,890
Right.
So everybody would like take advantage 

1977
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:41,890
of every opportunity and if you've got 
an opportunity to run a scam,

1978
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:43,610
you did it.
Yeah.

1979
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:46,370
And there's this terrible thing that 
happens in,

1980
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:51,400
in poor communities is that people do 
think of like insurance scams,

1981
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:52,800
this kind of scam.
Like you know,

1982
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:55,340
you gotta think about it like a score,
you know,

1983
01:34:55,341 --> 01:34:58,160
think about it like it's a score.
I've heard say that to me

1984
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,140
right now,
an older Italian guys.

1985
01:35:00,141 --> 01:35:01,250
Look,
you've got to think about this.

1986
01:35:01,251 --> 01:35:02,600
This is a score.
Okay?

1987
01:35:02,601 --> 01:35:04,700
Can't fuck this up.
You got an opportunity here.

1988
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:07,340
All you have to do is you go to the 
fucking chiropractor.

1989
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:09,740
My back hurts.
They can't tell you why your back hurts.

1990
01:35:09,741 --> 01:35:12,410
Nobody knows why you fucking back hurts.
Which is true.

1991
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:15,050
You would go to a chiropractor every day
and say,

1992
01:35:15,051 --> 01:35:17,900
my back is fucking killing me.
I got a shooting pain down my leg.

1993
01:35:17,901 --> 01:35:20,000
They can't prove it or disprove it.
Next thing you know,

1994
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:22,100
you get a $35,000
check in the mail.

1995
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:23,010
Oh,
right.

1996
01:35:23,290 --> 01:35:23,800
Yeah.
I,

1997
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:24,430
you know,
man,

1998
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,690
here's the thing.
Number one,

1999
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:30,750
I felt like I have to say this,
I would not have turned this fucking 

2000
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:30,990
that woman in if I was not a private 
investigator,

2001
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:36,470
but that'd be in Dolan ethically had to 
turn her in because if he didn't he 

2002
01:35:36,551 --> 01:35:41,551
would be guilty of stealing from the 
person who was giving him money to do 

2003
01:35:41,551 --> 01:35:41,620
the job.
There was never a question.

2004
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:43,420
Right.
So that's what he did for a living.

2005
01:35:43,421 --> 01:35:44,920
He was turned around,
but the,

2006
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:49,930
the,
the main like problem with stealing a 

2007
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:51,290
like,
you know,

2008
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:56,320
sometimes I've been hanging out with 
people you leave a grocery store and 

2009
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,280
somehow they didn't charge for like a,
I dunno,

2010
01:35:58,281 --> 01:36:00,980
a bottle of water or whatever.
Like they didn't see it in the car.

2011
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:03,110
Right.
And the people,

2012
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:06,130
some people are like,
I did it.

2013
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:07,340
Free water.

2014
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:08,810
They fucked up.
Right.

2015
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:14,140
And like man,
I think those people are unaware of this

2016
01:36:14,631 --> 01:36:19,631
like weird law in the universe,
which is that you seem to like have to 

2017
01:36:19,631 --> 01:36:24,000
get shipped back times three,
it feels like maybe a little bit more 

2018
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,421
than that when you give or take or to.
So like if you steal a $2 bottle of 

2019
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:30,440
water,
now this is my superstition,

2020
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:36,040
you're going to end up paying like at 
least six bucks for that bottle of water

2021
01:36:36,651 --> 01:36:38,450
in some other way.
Some Karmic,

2022
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:41,180
some shit's going to happen.
You're going to get a parking ticket,

2023
01:36:41,181 --> 01:36:42,890
you're going to get some weird fucking 
thing.

2024
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:47,660
So I think a thief is unaware of a 
metaphysical economy,

2025
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,840
which is like,
you think you're going to get away with 

2026
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:52,840
that,
but you're not like,

2027
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:55,490
if you could really get away with it,
it would give me pause.

2028
01:36:55,670 --> 01:37:00,670
But like I've noticed man,
all my friends who are really 

2029
01:37:00,670 --> 01:37:04,691
successful,
they leave giant fucking tips,

2030
01:37:05,170 --> 01:37:07,990
crazy tips,
crazy tips,

2031
01:37:07,991 --> 01:37:09,220
you know,
a few of these people,

2032
01:37:09,221 --> 01:37:14,221
Joe tips were like,
it makes the waitress cry.

2033
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:20,880
And also I've noticed they will dodge 
out of a place before they can be 

2034
01:37:21,161 --> 01:37:24,880
acknowledged for leaving some insanely 
massive tip to.

2035
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:26,270
I'm right here.
You don't have to talk about milk.

2036
01:37:26,290 --> 01:37:27,910
I'm not here,
I just don't want to fuck it.

2037
01:37:27,911 --> 01:37:29,230
Embarrass you man.
Because it's like,

2038
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:31,220
you know,
a lot of don't.

2039
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,300
But the main thing is like that's a love
bomb.

2040
01:37:34,301 --> 01:37:35,730
That's why I was called up.
Yeah,

2041
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:37,810
leave a love bomb for the winter.
Right.

2042
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:43,260
But I think also there's another side to
it that is more than just like the 

2043
01:37:43,870 --> 01:37:47,320
feeling you get of knowing you've been 
generous and you're not that attached to

2044
01:37:47,370 --> 01:37:48,070
money.
No,

2045
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:53,080
it's not even that.
So you get an opportunity to give a 

2046
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:56,130
nudge in a positive.
They feel good so that they feel good.

2047
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:01,190
It looks so.
It gives you a hundred dollar tip for a 

2048
01:38:01,190 --> 01:38:01,320
fucking cup of coffee or something.
They get this feeling like,

2049
01:38:01,321 --> 01:38:05,100
Holy Shit.
All of a sudden a beautiful feeling of a

2050
01:38:05,101 --> 01:38:07,650
normal situation,
just a normal interaction.

2051
01:38:07,651 --> 01:38:09,420
I give you this and you can give me 
that.

2052
01:38:09,421 --> 01:38:10,260
And I say,
thank you.

2053
01:38:10,261 --> 01:38:11,070
And I go,
well,

2054
01:38:11,071 --> 01:38:12,810
in that normal interaction,
all of a sudden,

2055
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:17,840
boom.
You get this beautiful gift from a 

2056
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:17,840
stranger that didn't know how to do have
to do that for no reason at all.

2057
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,530
Just a little love bomb.
Yeah.

2058
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:24,531
It's.
It's even better when you're not there 

2059
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:24,531
when you're in the car driving and they 
realize you left before him.

2060
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:25,730
Right,
see that thing right there,

2061
01:38:25,731 --> 01:38:30,731
man,
that if you go back to what we were 

2062
01:38:30,731 --> 01:38:30,731
talking about about momentum.

2063
01:38:30,731 --> 01:38:31,170
Yeah.
Puts a little ripples out there.

2064
01:38:32,110 --> 01:38:33,630
Those ripples spread.
Yeah,

2065
01:38:33,631 --> 01:38:36,390
and it's not just with that obviously do
it with money.

2066
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,340
No,
it's being nice to people.

2067
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:43,490
Sometimes.
I've had days where like I'm just 

2068
01:38:43,490 --> 01:38:44,700
walking somewhere and someone looks at 
me and they go,

2069
01:38:44,701 --> 01:38:45,230
hey,
hi.

2070
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:46,530
How are you?
Everything good?

2071
01:38:46,531 --> 01:38:47,100
Yeah,
man,

2072
01:38:47,101 --> 01:38:48,150
everything's good.
How you doing?

2073
01:38:48,151 --> 01:38:49,380
I'm doing good.
I'm doing good.

2074
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:54,381
Enjoy the day.
It's just so nice little friendly 

2075
01:38:54,381 --> 01:38:55,140
interaction with some person who never 
met before and for no reason.

2076
01:38:55,141 --> 01:38:58,230
Just wants to be a nice guy.
Those make you feel good,

2077
01:38:58,231 --> 01:38:59,050
man.
Those are.

2078
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,520
Those are nice moments and contract.
Conversely,

2079
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:07,610
weird moments that I've had where people
that are distracted and they're looking 

2080
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:07,610
at their phone,
they're not paying attention.

2081
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:12,181
I'm like,
this fucking dummy that almost ran into 

2082
01:39:12,181 --> 01:39:12,181
me.
I don't have to think that,

2083
01:39:12,181 --> 01:39:13,380
whether it's a dumb way to think,
but I do think it,

2084
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:15,220
especially if it's like a kid,
you know,

2085
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:17,040
some fucking kid just trying to push it.

2086
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:19,530
Where's the opposing army?
And they almost run into you like,

2087
01:39:19,531 --> 01:39:21,390
hey dude,
your phone.

2088
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:22,230
Right,
right.

2089
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:25,800
They are radiating this momentum into 
the world.

2090
01:39:25,801 --> 01:39:27,570
They're not interacting with people that
are there.

2091
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:33,200
Versus a person who's like genuinely 
nice is I just see someone walking down 

2092
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,050
the street and they say,
good morning,

2093
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,010
good morning.
Yeah.

2094
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:40,250
And everybody feels good.
That's just a nice little thing like 

2095
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:40,250
that.
That's right.

2096
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:40,680
Those are those men,
those spread,

2097
01:39:40,681 --> 01:39:43,650
that person might do it to the next 
person they meet and then boom,

2098
01:39:43,651 --> 01:39:46,350
everybody's saying hi to everybody and 
everybody's hugging everybody.

2099
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:48,020
This is it.
Yeah.

2100
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:53,140
That's.
We talk about this probably every time 

2101
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:55,421
because we both agree that this is like 
probably if there was going to be a 

2102
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,710
nonviolent revolution in this country 
that wasn't based on voting,

2103
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,420
it's going to start with that.
And,

2104
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:04,280
and,
and,

2105
01:40:04,370 --> 01:40:06,200
uh,
in what is that,

2106
01:40:06,230 --> 01:40:06,950
you know,
in,

2107
01:40:06,951 --> 01:40:10,460
in the,
the thing I'm being taught is that thing

2108
01:40:10,461 --> 01:40:15,461
you're talking about,
it can be cultivated and refined so you 

2109
01:40:15,461 --> 01:40:18,080
can sort of,
that's why it's called a practice.

2110
01:40:18,081 --> 01:40:20,960
Like when you're sitting and you're 
watching your breath and you're learning

2111
01:40:20,961 --> 01:40:24,860
how to be in the moment instead of 
thinking,

2112
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:29,890
I'm doing this for this reason or that 
like I'm doing this because when I'm 

2113
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:32,000
like talking to somebody,
they're going to think I'm spiritual.

2114
01:40:32,001 --> 01:40:33,590
I'm doing this because I want to be more
focused.

2115
01:40:33,591 --> 01:40:35,720
I'm doing this because I have an anxiety
disorder.

2116
01:40:35,721 --> 01:40:37,070
I'm doing this because of this or that.

2117
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,520
That's great.
But there's another reason to do it,

2118
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:42,230
which is that,
uh,

2119
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:47,800
if you get really good at being in the 
moment with people and also when you're 

2120
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:48,990
sitting with yourself,
uh,

2121
01:40:49,730 --> 01:40:54,730
and learning who you are,
you have to start applying a lot of 

2122
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:56,970
compassion to yourself because you're 
going to sit man and you're going to.

2123
01:40:57,010 --> 01:41:02,010
Some shit's going to float to the 
surface of the stream that you wish had 

2124
01:41:02,010 --> 01:41:02,770
stayed under some rocks.
Man,

2125
01:41:02,771 --> 01:41:05,770
you're going to see not just shit that's
been done to you,

2126
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:11,400
but you're going to see shit that you've
done other people and you're going to 

2127
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:11,400
have to deal with that.
Right?

2128
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,870
And the.
And the way to deal with that is,

2129
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:15,850
is not to do like,
I don't know if you do this at all,

2130
01:41:15,851 --> 01:41:20,350
but sometimes like I will remember 
something from when I was very young and

2131
01:41:20,351 --> 01:41:22,210
be like,
you fucking Dick.

2132
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:27,390
I'll say it out loud to nobody yelling 
does someone like 15 years ago,

2133
01:41:27,671 --> 01:41:32,671
right?
Yelling at you at my past self like you 

2134
01:41:32,671 --> 01:41:32,671
motherfucker,
you know,

2135
01:41:32,671 --> 01:41:35,800
what have you got me into with my 
memory's Jesus Christ ban?

2136
01:41:35,801 --> 01:41:37,690
Why were you doing that?
Why did you do that?

2137
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:41,610
And so that's like the opposite of 
compassion for the self.

2138
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:43,330
Right?
So anyway,

2139
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:48,331
the point is if you can like sort of 
cultivate compassion for who you are 

2140
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:53,401
right now,
that's not to say use that as an excuse 

2141
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:59,580
to not try to become a kinder person.
But I'm saying cultivate compassion for 

2142
01:41:59,580 --> 01:41:59,770
the fact that like,
man,

2143
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:05,250
your dad had ptsd and you're fucking a 
folks got divorced when you were three 

2144
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:13,680
and your dad remarried an abusive woman 
who hated your fucking guts for seven 

2145
01:42:16,661 --> 01:42:21,661
fucking years.
And she did some really bad things to 

2146
01:42:21,661 --> 01:42:25,501
you over the course of that time that 
you are way too young to process or you 

2147
01:42:26,981 --> 01:42:30,280
had no,
you had no way to deal with that and now

2148
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:33,070
when you're in,
you're in your twenties or thirties,

2149
01:42:33,071 --> 01:42:36,730
you're realizing that you seem to be 
kind of a selfish cunt.

2150
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:38,140
And it's like,
well,

2151
01:42:38,141 --> 01:42:43,141
yeah,
the reason you're being a selfish quote 

2152
01:42:43,141 --> 01:42:45,910
comment is because you had to build up a
very high powered defense mechanism to 

2153
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:52,920
deal with the fact that you were abused 
for almost a decade when your brain was 

2154
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:56,080
forming more neurons than it ever will 
at any other point in its life.

2155
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:58,990
And now we can start having compassion 
for ourselves.

2156
01:42:59,010 --> 01:43:00,700
Instead of thinking,
I'm a selfish cunt.

2157
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:04,090
We could think,
oh,

2158
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:09,450
I've got too big a force field up.
I've developed a thing to protect me 

2159
01:43:10,121 --> 01:43:12,220
from an environment that I'm no longer 
in.

2160
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:16,820
And then the point is,
once you start becoming compassionate to

2161
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:21,840
yourself,
that's when you run into the person 

2162
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,290
who's being a selfish cunt,
who you can look at and say,

2163
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,730
oh,
I see you.

2164
01:43:27,970 --> 01:43:31,390
I know you are.
I don't know what it was.

2165
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:34,600
I don't know if it was an abusive 
parent.

2166
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:37,630
I don't know if it was a heartbreak.
I don't know if it's something you read.

2167
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:39,400
I don't know if it was something I don't
know.

2168
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:42,100
Maybe genetic,
I don't know,

2169
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:47,670
but I know from looking into myself 
enough to know that you deserve more 

2170
01:43:47,670 --> 01:43:49,360
compassion than you're getting.
That's it.

2171
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,040
So we have this agreement that everybody

2172
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:54,170
can learn up to a certain point.
Right?

2173
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:59,560
We agree that pretty much everyone who's
normal and not impaired mentally can 

2174
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:02,240
learn how to read.
Right.

2175
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:03,890
We agree this,
we agree to this.

2176
01:44:03,891 --> 01:44:04,740
I think say,
yeah,

2177
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:09,760
we agree to simple mathematics.
Everyone can learn how to add and 

2178
01:44:09,831 --> 01:44:14,831
subtract and multiply and after that it 
gets a little squirrely with division 

2179
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:16,480
people can't come,
but we're.

2180
01:44:16,481 --> 01:44:19,820
We're agreeing that with minimal paying 
attention in school,

2181
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,340
we could all achieve a certain level.
Yes,

2182
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:27,370
but there's very little very little 
attention ever paid to considering how 

2183
01:44:29,241 --> 01:44:34,241
you behave and how you think and how you
observe yourself and how you correct 

2184
01:44:34,241 --> 01:44:35,630
mistakes and how you learn from the 
past.

2185
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:40,990
It's never taught.
It's one of the most important things 

2186
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:42,950
I've ever learned in my life is to to 
not cling onto the past,

2187
01:44:42,951 --> 01:44:45,470
but don't forget it either.
That's great.

2188
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:48,260
Remember that you fucked up.
Don't do it again,

2189
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:53,500
but don't live in this world of 20 years
ago or 30 years ago or whatever.

2190
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:57,950
That one instance where you wish you 
didn't say this one thing to some person

2191
01:44:57,951 --> 01:45:02,951
or hit some person or drive your car 
where you should and whatever the fuck 

2192
01:45:02,951 --> 01:45:02,951
it is,
whatever.

2193
01:45:02,951 --> 01:45:04,970
Whatever thing that it was that you 
still sit back and go,

2194
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,080
God,
yeah.

2195
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:06,920
You know,
I've,

2196
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:11,090
I rear ended.
Somebody wants with my car when I was on

2197
01:45:11,091 --> 01:45:16,091
my way to selling it and I wasn't paying
attention at a red light and my scars.

2198
01:45:16,210 --> 01:45:21,210
I had a,
I think it was a 1978 oldsmobile cutlass

2199
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:27,730
and the front end.
I crunched this guy's bumper with the 

2200
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:28,880
fiberglass part of my car.
Didn't do shit to his car.

2201
01:45:28,881 --> 01:45:33,881
He had a truck,
but I fucked up my car on the way to 

2202
01:45:33,881 --> 01:45:37,691
selling it and I brought it to this 
person and the grill was like half 

2203
01:45:37,691 --> 01:45:38,300
hanging off and I remember in my car 
just going,

2204
01:45:38,301 --> 01:45:40,260
fuck,
fuck,

2205
01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:41,150
I just fucking.

2206
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:44,240
I was.
I was so broke and such a loser.

2207
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:47,420
I'm barely keeping it together and on my
way to selling this car,

2208
01:45:47,421 --> 01:45:51,140
I fucked it up and I was just like,
you fucking loser.

2209
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:56,160
Yeah.
I remember being in my car screaming at 

2210
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:56,160
myself,
you fucking loser.

2211
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:59,600
And I remember the guy bought it anyway,
just took a bunch of money off of it.

2212
01:45:59,601 --> 01:46:01,330
I forget what we agreed on.
Um,

2213
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:06,370
but,
but this feeling would haunt me for 

2214
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:06,650
months,
for months.

2215
01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:11,651
I'd be doing other things and I would 
think of rear ended that car not paying 

2216
01:46:11,651 --> 01:46:12,800
attention fucking up the.
I'm like,

2217
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:16,430
yeah,
because it wasn't even like an accident.

2218
01:46:16,610 --> 01:46:21,610
It was like I left my foot off the gas 
and it just slammed into somebody 

2219
01:46:21,610 --> 01:46:22,360
because I wasn't paying attention.
Right.

2220
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:26,270
Oh yeah.
So I let my foot off the brake rather.

2221
01:46:26,450 --> 01:46:31,450
It was,
it was something that I literally was 

2222
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:34,211
defining myself by for months.
I was thinking that I was a loser 

2223
01:46:34,211 --> 01:46:35,060
because I did this.
Yeah.

2224
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:37,280
Yeah,
that's it right there.

2225
01:46:37,281 --> 01:46:38,690
I said like,
Hey asshole,

2226
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:41,180
don't let your foot off the brake.
Pay attention what you're doing.

2227
01:46:41,181 --> 01:46:43,880
You're driving a fucking car.
I know you're only 18,

2228
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:45,710
but pay attention to what the fuck 
you're doing.

2229
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:50,740
It wasn't,
it wasn't that it was you fucking you 

2230
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:50,740
fucking

2231
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:53,700
loser.
Screaming at myself,

2232
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:55,650
Dude.
I was talking to this,

2233
01:46:55,820 --> 01:46:57,810
this dude at one of these randazzo 
retreats.

2234
01:46:57,811 --> 01:47:01,850
He's like in his twenties and like,
I'm,

2235
01:47:02,630 --> 01:47:03,690
I'm really,
by the way,

2236
01:47:03,691 --> 01:47:05,580
this wasn't a row.
I'm like really,

2237
01:47:05,581 --> 01:47:08,400
like veiling the person very,
very deeply here.

2238
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:13,640
But the point is this person was telling
me some shitty thing that had happened 

2239
01:47:13,921 --> 01:47:15,450
to them when they were a kid.
Right.

2240
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:21,140
And a real young and uh,
like it happened like at a,

2241
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:25,020
at a doctor's office.
The doctor,

2242
01:47:25,021 --> 01:47:27,360
like it was like a shitty doctor or 
something,

2243
01:47:27,361 --> 01:47:29,820
I don't know.
But the doctor like slap,

2244
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:31,530
slap the kid,
right?

2245
01:47:31,531 --> 01:47:32,700
Geez.
Yeah.

2246
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,440
And so,
uh,

2247
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:36,690
for what reason?
Well,

2248
01:47:36,691 --> 01:47:41,691
there's no reason is there joe,
like there's really no reason to slap a 

2249
01:47:41,691 --> 01:47:41,691
kid.
He's come to a doctor's office.

2250
01:47:41,691 --> 01:47:42,540
Right?
So for sure.

2251
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:44,440
Right.
What was the reasonable thing?

2252
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:46,800
The kids,
that's the thing my friend said.

2253
01:47:47,310 --> 01:47:49,440
My friend said,
well,

2254
01:47:49,441 --> 01:47:51,940
I was squirming around.
Oh Geez.

2255
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:57,920
He hadn't considered.
He hadn't even considered that he was 

2256
01:47:59,161 --> 01:48:01,320
five.
So like I said to him,

2257
01:48:01,321 --> 01:48:02,220
I'm like,
hey man,

2258
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:07,850
have.
When was the last time you picked up a 

2259
01:48:07,850 --> 01:48:09,771
five year old?
Do you know how small five-year-olds 

2260
01:48:09,771 --> 01:48:13,220
are?
Do you understand that you didn't do 

2261
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:17,210
anything wrong?
Did that was a shitty doctor that was a 

2262
01:48:17,210 --> 01:48:21,411
crazy fucking doctor and your whole life
to rationalize the fact that sometimes 

2263
01:48:22,330 --> 01:48:26,100
big people are crazy and slap little 
people.

2264
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:31,310
You tried to apply some logic or like 
tilt to the act itself right now,

2265
01:48:32,971 --> 01:48:37,050
that's a heavy burden to carry because 
if you think you're a bad five-year-old,

2266
01:48:37,051 --> 01:48:38,760
you're probably going to think you're a 
bad 30.

2267
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:41,190
God knows are going to think you're a 
bad 35 year old.

2268
01:48:41,191 --> 01:48:43,590
All the crazy shit you can do when 
you're 35.

2269
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:48,800
So it's like that mentality of looking 
back on our former self and hating it is

2270
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:56,730
the very same reason that we hate 
others.

2271
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:00,600
It's identical.
If I'm going to hate myself,

2272
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:04,440
definitely I'm giving myself permission.
Eight everybody else around me.

2273
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:09,830
And that's so the work is let's figure 
out how to like be compassionate to our 

2274
01:49:12,061 --> 01:49:17,061
former selves and not just when we were 
fucking kids in a doctor's office and 

2275
01:49:17,061 --> 01:49:18,810
not just 10 years ago and not just 20 
years ago,

2276
01:49:19,210 --> 01:49:22,230
like start and start now.
Like right now,

2277
01:49:22,231 --> 01:49:27,231
because you're sitting on top of a card 
house made of memory.

2278
01:49:27,631 --> 01:49:28,970
Right?
And it's like that.

2279
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:33,980
You're the entire thing.
So you got to love it all and then then 

2280
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:37,791
if you start doing that shit,
I have noticed your degree of country 

2281
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:41,880
drops by a lot.
It's not going to go away.

2282
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:44,310
It will definitely,
at least for me,

2283
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:52,100
I mean,
one of the things that we've,

2284
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:55,960
I've had many guys asked me before,
why do you,

2285
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:59,680
why are you so insistent on exercise?
It's a big one.

2286
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,450
Do you really think it helps you?
I'm like,

2287
01:50:01,451 --> 01:50:03,520
I know it helps me.
I don't want.

2288
01:50:03,670 --> 01:50:05,740
It's like jerking off,
but for the body,

2289
01:50:06,130 --> 01:50:07,810
like instead of the,
the,

2290
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:12,820
this,
this thing that you get when you jerk 

2291
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:14,941
off this relief from the need for sex,
there's an noticed tension that's 

2292
01:50:15,911 --> 01:50:19,210
constantly in your bio that flavors the 
way you think about things.

2293
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:21,670
It really just does.
Um,

2294
01:50:22,810 --> 01:50:24,580
last night my daughter was upset at 
something.

2295
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:27,280
She had gotten to a little tiffed with 
one of her friends,

2296
01:50:28,030 --> 01:50:33,030
super upset and really her friend,
she thought her friend was being mean 

2297
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:33,030
and just didn't,
you know,

2298
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:36,320
trying to deal with it.
We went into the garage and uh,

2299
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:37,690
I said,
let's just go.

2300
01:50:37,690 --> 01:50:39,670
We'll work out.
You'll feel better.

2301
01:50:40,030 --> 01:50:43,830
And I put the pads on and we started 
moving around,

2302
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:46,360
start throwing some kicks and punches,
start breaking a sweat.

2303
01:50:46,361 --> 01:50:49,690
Really getting into whap whap whap and 
getting him,

2304
01:50:49,691 --> 01:50:50,560
Woo.
This is fun.

2305
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:55,740
And then laughing and joking around and 
then we talked about it because I'm 

2306
01:50:55,931 --> 01:51:00,931
like,
now you can talk about it rationally 

2307
01:51:00,931 --> 01:51:00,931
because now it's not fucking with you 
too.

2308
01:51:00,931 --> 01:51:02,020
You have this energy that's pent up.
Yeah.

2309
01:51:02,021 --> 01:51:04,840
You got to let that energy out and then 
you're left with the thoughts.

2310
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:08,500
But too many people get stuck with the 
energy and the thought and the energy is

2311
01:51:08,501 --> 01:51:10,090
overwhelming the thought,
and it's like,

2312
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:11,380
oh,
this fucking emotional.

2313
01:51:12,350 --> 01:51:17,350
Yeah,
and I run around the block or a fucking 

2314
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:19,531
hitting the heavy bag or hitting the 
pads or skip some grub or whatever 

2315
01:51:19,531 --> 01:51:19,600
you're into.
Take a yoga class.

2316
01:51:19,601 --> 01:51:20,290
Whatever you wind,
do,

2317
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:24,380
drain the stress out of the body and 
then look at the object and the,

2318
01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:25,990
the idea for what it is.

2319
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:31,260
And this is a fucking important method 
of managing the way you think about 

2320
01:51:31,721 --> 01:51:36,721
things that people overlook.
They overlook the impact of physical 

2321
01:51:36,721 --> 01:51:38,650
tension on the body and your decision 
making process.

2322
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:39,940
Uh,
wow.

2323
01:51:39,941 --> 01:51:40,910
Yeah.
Do do you a.

2324
01:51:40,911 --> 01:51:43,370
do you believe that trauma is stored in 
the body?

2325
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:45,080
You think that's bullshit?
I don't know.

2326
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:50,160
I mean,
I know that trauma is something that 

2327
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:52,440
clings inside your subconsciousness.
Your subconsciousness is a part of your 

2328
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:53,230
consciousness.
Your consciousness supposedly resides in

2329
01:51:53,231 --> 01:51:58,231
your body.
So why wouldn't it be in your body 

2330
01:51:58,231 --> 01:51:58,231
somehow way,
shape or form,

2331
01:51:58,231 --> 01:51:58,231
right?
You know,

2332
01:51:58,231 --> 01:52:01,450
there's also the idea that there's parts
of your body that retained memory,

2333
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:06,990
not just your brain,
but there's neurons in your body and 

2334
01:52:06,990 --> 01:52:11,701
perhaps they retain memory,
like there's the concept that this 

2335
01:52:11,701 --> 01:52:12,580
apparent there's some type of neuron in 
the heart,

2336
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:13,790
right?
Yes.

2337
01:52:13,791 --> 01:52:18,791
And this is what a lot of people believe
was responsible for this idea of like 

2338
01:52:18,791 --> 01:52:20,950
follow your heart,
follow your heart.

2339
01:52:20,950 --> 01:52:23,370
Maybe if those are your memories and 
your,

2340
01:52:23,371 --> 01:52:25,960
your database of collective emotional 
ideas.

2341
01:52:25,961 --> 01:52:30,961
If there's really something to that and 
like maybe it's not just in the brain 

2342
01:52:30,961 --> 01:52:32,980
area but also in the heart area and in 
all the neurons.

2343
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:38,160
Maybe we just,
we just think because our consciousness 

2344
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:38,380
resides in the brain,
that all of our memories reside there as

2345
01:52:38,381 --> 01:52:41,260
well and that they're not in various 
areas of our body.

2346
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,540
People that get transplants,
man,

2347
01:52:43,541 --> 01:52:45,310
one of the weird things that they say,
they,

2348
01:52:45,370 --> 01:52:50,370
they find that they have cravings for 
things like the person who donated the 

2349
01:52:50,370 --> 01:52:51,160
Oregon.
Right?

2350
01:52:51,270 --> 01:52:56,270
Right.
I don't know if that's real or not 

2351
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:56,270
because obviously I've never gone 
through a transplant,

2352
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:56,270
but

2353
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:58,320
I've heard that shit a lot too.
And,

2354
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,250
and someone was explaining it to me 
like,

2355
01:53:00,251 --> 01:53:01,780
well,
like,

2356
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:04,180
Oh god,
here comes fucking Bro.

2357
01:53:04,181 --> 01:53:07,350
Scientists Trust.
Get ready.

2358
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:09,370
Here we go.
I'm ready.

2359
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:14,400
Dr Trussell.
I've got a fucking masters degree in 

2360
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:14,400
Bro.
Science.

2361
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:14,950
Oh yeah.
Dude do.

2362
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,630
Are you working tonight?
Yeah,

2363
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:18,370
Dude.
I am like,

2364
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:19,120
yeah,
why?

2365
01:53:19,121 --> 01:53:20,210
What's going on?
Ice House?

2366
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:21,820
I can't do it.
That's okay.

2367
01:53:22,270 --> 01:53:26,040
I'm a dude.
Thank you so much though on.

2368
01:53:26,350 --> 01:53:30,490
I was just thinking before I do my bro 
Science thing,

2369
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:33,040
man,
your daughter's fucking lucky.

2370
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:38,340
God Damn Your Dad's like,
let's go to the gym in the House and 

2371
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:41,590
fucking kickbox you're upset.
That's super cool man.

2372
01:53:41,620 --> 01:53:43,210
I was just thinking that.
The other thing.

2373
01:53:43,211 --> 01:53:43,540
Well it's

2374
01:53:43,570 --> 01:53:46,660
only cool if they like it.
The thing is she likes to do it.

2375
01:53:46,810 --> 01:53:50,290
This is one thing that I think is 
extremely important because I see people

2376
01:53:50,291 --> 01:53:53,560
that get their son to play football 
because they played football and the kid

2377
01:53:53,561 --> 01:53:55,440
doesn't want to play fucking football.
Yeah,

2378
01:53:55,810 --> 01:54:00,810
man,
you got to let your kids be who they 

2379
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:00,810
are.
They get super resentful.

2380
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:02,950
I've seen people raise their kids and 
try to force their kids into holes.

2381
01:54:03,070 --> 01:54:06,100
You got to support them and love them 
and let them find their path.

2382
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:08,200
You have to.
You have to let them find their path.

2383
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:13,260
You can't decide they're going to be a 
doctor or decide they're going to be a 

2384
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:15,961
lawyer.
Decide they're going to be whatever the 

2385
01:54:15,961 --> 01:54:15,961
fuck you want them to be.
They they got to be what they are.

2386
01:54:15,961 --> 01:54:20,820
We're all so different and you are 
literally robbing a kid of their future.

2387
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:27,420
If you over influence their choice 
making in terms of like not following 

2388
01:54:27,791 --> 01:54:30,340
their passion or their dream or their 
ideas.

2389
01:54:30,590 --> 01:54:35,590
You and it can be done,
and this is to say that it can't be done

2390
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:40,860
is it's all so many people can't do it.
So many people don't get their 

2391
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:44,611
doctorate.
So many people don't ever become 

2392
01:54:44,611 --> 01:54:46,600
scientists or astronauts or fucking 
mathematicians.

2393
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:48,220
A lot of things are hard to do,
man,

2394
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:49,090
right?
A lot of things.

2395
01:54:49,091 --> 01:54:54,091
Right,
but you can't decide the way that kids 

2396
01:54:54,091 --> 01:54:54,091
brain works.
You're not in there,

2397
01:54:54,091 --> 01:54:58,370
right?
You're not in there and it's different 

2398
01:54:58,370 --> 01:54:58,370
than yours and hers is different than 
his right.

2399
01:54:58,370 --> 01:55:00,580
His brother is different than this 
sister and the mom is different than all

2400
01:55:00,581 --> 01:55:03,280
of them and you've got to let people be.
You got to let them be.

2401
01:55:03,570 --> 01:55:08,570
You have to in people don't.
And those fucking people hate their 

2402
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:08,570
parents.

2403
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:13,440
Those people did to develop this fucking
resentment because there's no freedom 

2404
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:14,190
there.
Fucking mom is always on.

2405
01:55:14,191 --> 01:55:16,450
I'm mom.
I don't want to do that.

2406
01:55:16,510 --> 01:55:18,340
You just stopped.
I raised you.

2407
01:55:18,341 --> 01:55:20,200
I didn't raise you to talk to me like 
this.

2408
01:55:20,470 --> 01:55:23,350
You're my son.
I don't want you being a loser.

2409
01:55:23,351 --> 01:55:23,950
Do you?
Will get it.

2410
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:25,090
Do you understand it?
Like,

2411
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:26,880
ah,
yeah,

2412
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,420
I don't want to be a doctor.
Yeah.

2413
01:55:28,690 --> 01:55:31,300
I'm so disappointed in you.
I know friends where their parents don't

2414
01:55:31,301 --> 01:55:34,030
talk to them anymore because they 
changed majors.

2415
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:36,420
Yeah,
they changed majors.

2416
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:39,490
A Dad stop talking to them.
What side?

2417
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:40,100
Yo,
you don't want.

2418
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:42,160
You don't want to take on the company 
business.

2419
01:55:42,490 --> 01:55:43,580
You don't want to take the company.
You have.

2420
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:44,070
The idea

2421
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:49,070
was we were going to send you to go to 
school when you were going to take over 

2422
01:55:49,070 --> 01:55:49,070
the company business.
Yeah.

2423
01:55:49,070 --> 01:55:50,520
Maybe in a band you fucking loser.

2424
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:54,630
Some people have a really.
It's like we got to be so much kinder to

2425
01:55:54,631 --> 01:55:58,020
people when you just think in shit like 
that helps you understand how people are

2426
01:55:58,021 --> 01:56:00,450
like you run into just about anybody 
man,

2427
01:56:00,451 --> 01:56:05,451
and it's like so easy to,
to have someone in your life and enjoy 

2428
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:09,420
the idea that they're an asshole and 
they deserve it,

2429
01:56:09,421 --> 01:56:13,290
but if you spend just a speck of time 
thinking about it,

2430
01:56:13,950 --> 01:56:16,590
it's like if we really sat in a weird 
way,

2431
01:56:16,591 --> 01:56:17,340
it sucks.

2432
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:20,640
We'll just wait until you have kids.
Then it gets really,

2433
01:56:20,641 --> 01:56:25,641
really interesting because you start 
looking at people like they used to be 

2434
01:56:25,641 --> 01:56:26,100
babies.
That's what happened to me.

2435
01:56:26,930 --> 01:56:28,020
Boy,
come and man,

2436
01:56:28,021 --> 01:56:29,670
are you do I don't like?
Yeah,

2437
01:56:29,671 --> 01:56:33,660
this is the first place I've said it.
Holy Shit Daddy.

2438
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:36,210
She said it's okay.
You know you get when,

2439
01:56:36,290 --> 01:56:39,480
when you're in the early Montero.
I don't know

2440
01:56:39,610 --> 01:56:41,190
why,
but like if you're scared,

2441
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:44,620
it's such a sacred thing.
You know?

2442
01:56:44,770 --> 01:56:47,760
It's a vulnerable thing to talk about.
It makes you feel vulnerable.

2443
01:56:47,761 --> 01:56:52,761
It makes you feel nervous and because of
the energy or you're worried about 

2444
01:56:52,761 --> 01:56:52,950
talking to fucking love it,

2445
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:55,770
it is the most transformative,
like,

2446
01:56:55,771 --> 01:57:00,771
you know,
like you hear all the time to the point 

2447
01:57:00,771 --> 01:57:03,090
where I was like suspicious of it.
Like I was like,

2448
01:57:03,110 --> 01:57:08,110
you know,
I don't stand up has done this job for 

2449
01:57:08,110 --> 01:57:08,110
awhile,
so I think I'm allowed to say I urge you

2450
01:57:08,110 --> 01:57:09,620
not,
should I not even what's,

2451
01:57:09,670 --> 01:57:10,050
what's the.

2452
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:10,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

2453
01:57:10,931 --> 01:57:12,220
He doesn't do any.
His old stuff.

2454
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:15,730
He's got some of my favorite jokes of 
all time.

2455
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:20,940
Many of them.
But he's got this killer fucking joke 

2456
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:24,510
about Alva like a pregnant people are 
like heroin addicts,

2457
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:26,110
you know?
They're like,

2458
01:57:26,111 --> 01:57:27,460
just try it.
You'll love it.

2459
01:57:27,461 --> 01:57:28,620
Just try it.
And then.

2460
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:30,650
And then when you do it,
like,

2461
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:32,020
you know,
you're stuck,

2462
01:57:32,021 --> 01:57:34,480
you're trapped.
Which is how I used to think.

2463
01:57:34,990 --> 01:57:39,990
But man,
it's so humbling to realize that all 

2464
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:44,710
this shit you heard that was true in the
sense that you hear people say,

2465
01:57:44,711 --> 01:57:46,960
oh no,
it's psychedelic psychedelic.

2466
01:57:46,990 --> 01:57:51,990
Now I,
I always associated that with like when 

2467
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:54,670
the baby's born,
there must be some serotonin or dopamine

2468
01:57:54,671 --> 01:57:56,320
that gets released,
not just in the woman.

2469
01:57:56,321 --> 01:58:01,030
We know the woman's brain is flooded 
with oxytocin and a variety of things.

2470
01:58:01,031 --> 01:58:03,100
The mother,
the bonding chemicals,

2471
01:58:03,101 --> 01:58:04,570
but you know,
I thought,

2472
01:58:04,571 --> 01:58:06,520
well that clearly would happen for the 
father,

2473
01:58:06,521 --> 01:58:07,930
maybe just not in the same level.

2474
01:58:07,930 --> 01:58:10,600
So when people say it's Psychedelic,
that must be what they meet,

2475
01:58:11,530 --> 01:58:15,550
but now I know you know,
the birth is,

2476
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:20,620
hasn't happened yet,
but just being in the presence of a 

2477
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:23,641
person who's growing a life inside of 
their belly and realizing that like the 

2478
01:58:25,361 --> 01:58:29,830
bonding that's happening there and like 
the sacred duty is coming up.

2479
01:58:29,831 --> 01:58:34,831
If you being a father and that a soul is
coming into this dimension that is going

2480
01:58:35,381 --> 01:58:40,381
to be.
I'm completely dependent on you and my 

2481
01:58:40,661 --> 01:58:44,260
wife course wanting to keep her safe and
then man,

2482
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:49,320
it.
The combination of all these things is 

2483
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:51,961
so incredibly psychedelic and the most 
beautiful way and so humbling because 

2484
01:58:53,681 --> 01:58:54,760
it's like,
boy,

2485
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:58,900
oh boy,
did I fucking tell myself that.

2486
01:58:58,901 --> 01:59:03,901
I'd figured out something really smart 
and that was like reproduction is a 

2487
01:59:06,491 --> 01:59:11,491
trick of the DNA and this marriage thing
and the baby thing is some kind of vast 

2488
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:18,340
digital societal Oregon,
like the opinion decks.

2489
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:21,700
We don't need to do that.
There's nothing to it.

2490
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:24,130
Obviously I wasn't using that voice,
but like,

2491
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:29,110
it was such a pretentious fucking 
pompous,

2492
01:59:29,111 --> 01:59:34,111
ridiculous place that I was standing at,
which is to judge people for 

2493
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:39,920
reproducing,
having,

2494
01:59:40,660 --> 01:59:44,260
enjoying the ability to judge because my
parents reproduced.

2495
01:59:44,470 --> 01:59:48,670
You know what I mean?
So it's so humbling to realize like,

2496
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:51,730
oh,
I was wrong,

2497
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:57,190
but I wasn't just like kinder on,
like I was deeply fundamentally,

2498
01:59:57,400 --> 02:00:02,400
completely wrong about this phase of 
life in this.

2499
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:05,650
Uh,
what's the word for it?

2500
02:00:05,651 --> 02:00:06,280
This,
um,

2501
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:07,840
well,
I like,

2502
02:00:07,841 --> 02:00:10,930
in Hinduism they call it an Ostrom,
like a monastery.

2503
02:00:10,931 --> 02:00:13,630
It's called the Green Hosta Ostrom.
It's like a temple.

2504
02:00:13,631 --> 02:00:15,790
It's considered to be like a temple.
The family.

2505
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:19,510
Holy Fuck Man.
It's real.

2506
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:22,120
The rubbers hit the road man.
And it's like,

2507
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:24,880
it's really,
really beautiful though,

2508
02:00:25,410 --> 02:00:28,040
obviously a little scary.
Yeah,

2509
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:30,660
it's love.
It's real love.

2510
02:00:30,690 --> 02:00:35,690
And it's love where you know you're 
going to be able to love your children 

2511
02:00:35,690 --> 02:00:37,800
unconditionally in a in a very strange 
way that we really have a hard time with

2512
02:00:37,801 --> 02:00:42,801
other people.
And I think the thing about it is not 

2513
02:00:42,801 --> 02:00:45,210
just that you're bringing a life into 
this world which is very psychedelic,

2514
02:00:45,510 --> 02:00:49,080
but that your love bond with this kid is
so ultimate.

2515
02:00:49,170 --> 02:00:50,730
It's so.
It's so intense.

2516
02:00:51,030 --> 02:00:54,870
The love that you have for each other to
raising the kid together.

2517
02:00:54,871 --> 02:00:59,871
There's a thing that happens with people
when they are just really deeply 

2518
02:01:03,170 --> 02:01:08,170
connected at a DNA level.
Like this is a little person that is 

2519
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:13,570
literally come out of nowhere from two 
bodies and it's.

2520
02:01:13,640 --> 02:01:16,500
It makes you realize how precious life 
is,

2521
02:01:16,501 --> 02:01:21,501
how vulnerable we all are.
And it makes you realize that it's such 

2522
02:01:21,501 --> 02:01:23,520
a cliche phrase,
the actual power of love.

2523
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,690
And then it's not just the love of this 
kid or the love of yourselves,

2524
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:32,040
the two together and the family together
and all the other people that you love.

2525
02:01:32,041 --> 02:01:34,410
It's a love of all people.
It's the love.

2526
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:37,680
It's just if we just really have a hard 
time loving people,

2527
02:01:37,860 --> 02:01:40,100
we have a really hard time.
The people going to love us

2528
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:41,990
back or they're not gonna get in our 
way.

2529
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:47,120
They're not going to be overly needy or 
annoying or they're not going to be 

2530
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:47,660
intrusive or they're not going to tell 
you what to do,

2531
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:50,300
which is why people hate their fucking 
parents telling them what to do.

2532
02:01:50,301 --> 02:01:51,980
Oh,
it comes with this bullshit.

2533
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:56,090
Love comes with this nonsense.
Love comes with fucking rules and I have

2534
02:01:56,091 --> 02:01:58,970
to be annoyed all the time.
I have to wear my suit on Sunday.

2535
02:01:59,540 --> 02:02:01,340
Fuck love.
Fuck it.

2536
02:02:01,341 --> 02:02:03,410
I don't want it.
Then that carries on.

2537
02:02:03,411 --> 02:02:08,411
You develop these,
the shields that you put up for the 

2538
02:02:08,411 --> 02:02:08,411
whole world.
Because of that.

2539
02:02:08,411 --> 02:02:09,690
That's one of the most common things 
that people do when,

2540
02:02:09,770 --> 02:02:12,140
when in terms of like our definitions of
love,

2541
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:15,770
we define it by the people that were 
supposed to be the lovers in our lives,

2542
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:21,160
but they'll just unconditional kindness 
and love so so few people are balanced.

2543
02:02:21,650 --> 02:02:25,640
In the beginning of the relationship.
It's just lust and then after awhile you

2544
02:02:25,641 --> 02:02:28,610
get annoyed with each other and you 
can't wait to get free and find somebody

2545
02:02:28,611 --> 02:02:31,160
else who's going to make you happy.
They don't make you happy either.

2546
02:02:31,161 --> 02:02:34,790
And most of us in the early years of our
lives in particular,

2547
02:02:34,791 --> 02:02:36,330
we bounce around,
you know,

2548
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:41,350
we try to find a new person that's gonna
make us happy and we attract the kind of

2549
02:02:42,861 --> 02:02:45,410
people that are the most destructive for
us.

2550
02:02:45,411 --> 02:02:48,800
I mean for some strange reason,
we're always looking to be distracted.

2551
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:53,980
Yes.
And when I think when you can learn how 

2552
02:02:54,081 --> 02:02:59,081
to abandon that and it's not a learned.
Like now I know it's a slow gradual 

2553
02:02:59,081 --> 02:03:03,500
process where the instances of 
continuous occur less frequently,

2554
02:03:03,580 --> 02:03:08,580
right?
Less and less and less and less 

2555
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:08,580
frequently to your more and more and 
more kind.

2556
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:08,590
And then you,
you know,

2557
02:03:08,591 --> 02:03:11,930
you get it as good as you can get it on,
on any given day.

2558
02:03:12,470 --> 02:03:17,470
And that's part of being the hairless 
ape in this strange land of electronics 

2559
02:03:17,691 --> 02:03:20,210
and you know,
and concrete buildings.

2560
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:25,250
We're still trying to figure out the 
rules to this completely new way of 

2561
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:28,541
living.
And part of this completely new way of 

2562
02:03:28,541 --> 02:03:30,851
living has shifted over the last 10 
years and that's where the Internet 

2563
02:03:30,851 --> 02:03:30,851
comes in the last 10,
20 years,

2564
02:03:30,980 --> 02:03:35,980
no more than 24 years.
The whole world's changed topsy turvy up

2565
02:03:36,201 --> 02:03:38,930
to down.
I mean the whole thing is just different

2566
02:03:38,931 --> 02:03:40,790
now.
It's a different reality.

2567
02:03:40,791 --> 02:03:44,690
Anybody from any point in the past,
if you transport them to today,

2568
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:49,070
they'd be living in some fucking blade 
runner movie.

2569
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:53,060
I mean it really is a Ridley Scott Film.
You know for sure.

2570
02:03:53,061 --> 02:03:58,061
If you were living in the 19 fifties and
someone brought you to 2018 and picked 

2571
02:03:58,061 --> 02:04:00,170
you up from the airport and a tesla,
you're on a plane.

2572
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:03,740
Seems normal playing just like planes.
What are these screens on the seats?

2573
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:08,770
Holy Shit.
And screens in the seats and someone 

2574
02:04:08,770 --> 02:04:08,770
picks you up in a tesla.
It doesn't make any noise.

2575
02:04:08,770 --> 02:04:13,511
It's electric.
There's a giant laptop in the front of 

2576
02:04:13,511 --> 02:04:15,761
it.
It shows this huge map and you're 

2577
02:04:15,761 --> 02:04:16,520
driving around and people are taking 
phone calls in the air.

2578
02:04:16,590 --> 02:04:17,210
It just,
Hey,

2579
02:04:17,211 --> 02:04:18,200
what's up Mike?
You're like,

2580
02:04:18,201 --> 02:04:19,610
what?
You're talking in the car?

2581
02:04:19,611 --> 02:04:20,880
What the fuck,
uh,

2582
02:04:20,900 --> 02:04:25,430
driving around to all these different 
places and you see the,

2583
02:04:25,431 --> 02:04:30,431
the,
the mass of humans and the architecture 

2584
02:04:30,431 --> 02:04:32,891
change and people would freak the fuck 
out with the and this is the world that 

2585
02:04:32,891 --> 02:04:34,910
we've totally,
completely become accustomed to.

2586
02:04:34,940 --> 02:04:36,230
That's right,
and no one,

2587
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:40,460
no one's for this.
We're all just playing it on ear and the

2588
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:45,500
worst aspects of it that some of the 
chaos and those social upheaval and the 

2589
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:49,140
way the being,
the infighting between people,

2590
02:04:49,141 --> 02:04:54,141
people getting kicked out of restaurants
because they work for the wrong people 

2591
02:04:54,141 --> 02:04:54,141
and put this.

2592
02:04:54,141 --> 02:04:58,340
If you see maxine waters telling people 
that if you find people that it worked 

2593
02:04:58,340 --> 02:04:59,760
for the trump administration,
you find them in a restaurant.

2594
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:04,880
You find them anywhere.
You go and you get together a group of 

2595
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:08,181
people.
You build a crowd and you let them know 

2596
02:05:08,181 --> 02:05:08,340
that you don't agree with their policies
like,

2597
02:05:08,341 --> 02:05:11,970
Whoa,
we're calling for gangs were calling for

2598
02:05:11,971 --> 02:05:15,660
gangs of people randomly industry to 
interrupt people's meals,

2599
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:18,480
interrupt people in stores.
Get a crowd together.

2600
02:05:18,481 --> 02:05:23,481
Don't let them be in.
Be Safe in public because you disagree 

2601
02:05:23,481 --> 02:05:23,760
with their policies.
Woo.

2602
02:05:23,790 --> 02:05:26,970
This is getting crazy and I know one of 
the policies of the immigrants,

2603
02:05:27,090 --> 02:05:29,220
the children of immigrants being 
separated from their parents,

2604
02:05:29,221 --> 02:05:31,560
which I'm 100 percent with you.
It's immoral.

2605
02:05:31,561 --> 02:05:36,561
It's disgusting.
It saddens me that it's even considered 

2606
02:05:36,561 --> 02:05:36,810
an option.
It makes no sense.

2607
02:05:36,811 --> 02:05:38,490
I don't give a fuck if they broke the 
law.

2608
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:41,100
You don't take parents and kids and 
separate them.

2609
02:05:41,101 --> 02:05:42,870
You just fucking don't.
It's just disgusting.

2610
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:44,970
There's other ways around it.
If you're saying,

2611
02:05:44,971 --> 02:05:46,050
well,
they shouldn't have broke the law.

2612
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:51,320
Maybe they shouldn't have broke the law.
You don't get to do something that's a 

2613
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:52,770
thousand times worse than crossing a 
line that dirt,

2614
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:55,620
that fucking imaginary line in the dirt 
crossing.

2615
02:05:55,621 --> 02:06:00,621
That is nothing in comparison to your 
crime of stealing a baby from its 

2616
02:06:00,621 --> 02:06:01,980
mother.
That's fucking insane.

2617
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:04,080
That's not American.
Two thousand 18.

2618
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:06,930
That's just insane and we wouldn't be 
doing that to Canadians.

2619
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:12,020
Okay.
If Canadians came over here with their 

2620
02:06:12,020 --> 02:06:12,020
beautiful,
cute blond haired kids,

2621
02:06:12,020 --> 02:06:12,630
just were not stealing them from their 
parents,

2622
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:14,400
and that's one of the reasons why it's 
sick.

2623
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:17,580
The whole thing sick.
It's chaos.

2624
02:06:17,610 --> 02:06:22,610
So in one hand,
on one hand I understand where a lot of 

2625
02:06:22,610 --> 02:06:24,090
people were outraged and I understand 
where they're coming from.

2626
02:06:24,330 --> 02:06:27,000
You shouldn't separate parents from the 
children in any way,

2627
02:06:27,001 --> 02:06:28,890
shape or form,
but the way to fix that,

2628
02:06:28,891 --> 02:06:33,891
as not saying anybody who's on that team
and working for that administration 

2629
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:38,070
should be chased by a mob of street 
vigilantes.

2630
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:40,620
And you should encourage this mom,
make a crowd,

2631
02:06:40,950 --> 02:06:42,480
get everybody together,
make a crowd,

2632
02:06:42,481 --> 02:06:44,250
make some noise,
let them know they're not welcomed.

2633
02:06:44,251 --> 02:06:45,210
Like,
Whoa,

2634
02:06:45,890 --> 02:06:47,840
well isn't.
It isn't like who.

2635
02:06:47,841 --> 02:06:52,841
One of the,
one of the problems with it is now we 

2636
02:06:52,841 --> 02:06:55,600
have a little bit of a slippery slope.
Like we let's,

2637
02:06:55,680 --> 02:07:00,680
you know,
I don't want to play mob justice ping 

2638
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:02,410
pong with you,
right?

2639
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:04,750
Because if I start playing that with 
you,

2640
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:08,860
they're not ping pong could potentially 
turn into a civil war.

2641
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:10,390
Do you know there was a reason

2642
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:15,450
USA Today poll that said 31 percent of 
America thinks that we're close to a 

2643
02:07:15,450 --> 02:07:15,450
civil war

2644
02:07:15,450 --> 02:07:19,290
right now.
Now that being said no.

2645
02:07:19,370 --> 02:07:23,600
And also people who like fantasize about
a civil war,

2646
02:07:24,290 --> 02:07:28,640
I don't know if they've really thought 
it out all the way,

2647
02:07:28,641 --> 02:07:31,430
like what that looks like.
I can answer that for you.

2648
02:07:31,550 --> 02:07:33,110
They definitely have it.
Right.

2649
02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:36,250
So definitely have it because if they 
did and they thought

2650
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:38,020
it through and thought it was a good 
idea,

2651
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:41,290
they're out of their fucking minds.
They're crazy or they're stupid.

2652
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:42,590
Yeah.
But,

2653
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:46,080
but was really passionate about that and
that man.

2654
02:07:46,081 --> 02:07:47,060
Well,
I mean because he will,

2655
02:07:47,061 --> 02:07:49,740
he wants to fucking be in a goddamn 
civil war.

2656
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:51,120
But the,
the,

2657
02:07:51,220 --> 02:07:52,350
the,
you know,

2658
02:07:52,620 --> 02:07:56,200
for me when I see shit like that going 
down,

2659
02:07:56,820 --> 02:07:58,770
um,
I,

2660
02:07:58,771 --> 02:08:01,110
I see,
I,

2661
02:08:01,111 --> 02:08:03,910
I've like come up with like I didn't 
come up with,

2662
02:08:03,911 --> 02:08:08,080
I got it from the Dalai Lama,
but I've come up with like a good little

2663
02:08:08,081 --> 02:08:13,081
equation to,
to go back to which is does this reduce 

2664
02:08:13,691 --> 02:08:14,950
suffering?
Right.

2665
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:17,470
So like,
and I don't think it,

2666
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:19,520
it reduces suffering.
And,

2667
02:08:19,530 --> 02:08:24,530
and these people who are really upset on
both sides of the fence are suffering.

2668
02:08:25,121 --> 02:08:30,121
Like we're,
we're really looking at like a world 

2669
02:08:30,121 --> 02:08:32,431
where a lot of people are deeply upset,
deeply suffering,

2670
02:08:32,561 --> 02:08:35,440
and really scared and really,
really,

2671
02:08:35,441 --> 02:08:37,540
really freaking the fuck out.
And,

2672
02:08:37,570 --> 02:08:42,570
and as I've been watching this thing 
emerge on the Internet,

2673
02:08:43,270 --> 02:08:48,270
on twitter where people tweet things 
that paint that you look at it and you 

2674
02:08:50,411 --> 02:08:55,411
think it's almost as though you're 
living in another world than I am like 

2675
02:08:55,411 --> 02:08:58,870
the world that you're,
you're talking about man,

2676
02:08:58,871 --> 02:09:00,250
it's fucking terrifying.

2677
02:09:00,250 --> 02:09:04,090
Like it's scary and it's like it's,
it's really fucked up.

2678
02:09:04,091 --> 02:09:09,091
And maybe like the reason I think that 
is because I started doing lsd when I 

2679
02:09:10,931 --> 02:09:13,450
was 16,
so when I was,

2680
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:18,840
when I was 16 I w r I became brutally 
aware of the fact that the current 

2681
02:09:22,270 --> 02:09:27,270
government in the past government was 
repressive and,

2682
02:09:27,351 --> 02:09:28,070
and,
and I,

2683
02:09:28,071 --> 02:09:33,071
and something about that drug,
which I don't do anymore because it's 

2684
02:09:33,071 --> 02:09:33,960
illegal.
I was a crazy kid.

2685
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:39,260
But something about that drug really 
shows you the conditioning.

2686
02:09:39,870 --> 02:09:44,460
Right?
And so I knew from a pretty young age,

2687
02:09:44,461 --> 02:09:45,510
I was like,
Oh wow,

2688
02:09:45,511 --> 02:09:47,490
I don't,
I don't think the United States is,

2689
02:09:47,700 --> 02:09:52,350
is dropping bombs on other countries 
because of justice or some threat.

2690
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:57,680
It appears to be that some people are 
making money off of this shit and I 

2691
02:09:57,781 --> 02:10:01,020
don't think these drugs are illegal 
because they're bad for you.

2692
02:10:01,290 --> 02:10:06,290
I think they're illegal because somebody
doesn't want the herd to experience 

2693
02:10:09,361 --> 02:10:13,440
these states of consciousness because it
will make them more difficult to share.

2694
02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:18,660
I had this conversation with Hamilton 
Morris yesterday and he strongly 

2695
02:10:18,660 --> 02:10:21,241
disagrees because he's talked to the 
people actually in the dea if she's 

2696
02:10:21,241 --> 02:10:21,610
talked to the people in drug and forest 
for sure.

2697
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:26,700
And he said that what really is 
happening is they have zero experience 

2698
02:10:26,700 --> 02:10:30,451
with these drugs,
but they know these drugs are illegal 

2699
02:10:30,451 --> 02:10:30,970
and so they pursue it as if it's a 
viable target.

2700
02:10:31,150 --> 02:10:33,980
And we talked about it in terms of the 
real problem with law enforcement

2701
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:38,980
being that it's a game.
I've always said that the real problem 

2702
02:10:38,980 --> 02:10:41,831
with tops is not cops.
The real problem with cops is human 

2703
02:10:41,831 --> 02:10:42,110
nature.
This is a bad guy.

2704
02:10:42,111 --> 02:10:44,840
I get a point if I take him out,
you start looking for bad guys.

2705
02:10:44,870 --> 02:10:46,430
He started looking for bad guys that 
aren't even there.

2706
02:10:46,431 --> 02:10:47,750
You start forcing situation.

2707
02:10:47,930 --> 02:10:48,620
Yeah,
yeah,

2708
02:10:48,621 --> 02:10:49,670
yeah.
I know comes.

2709
02:10:50,230 --> 02:10:51,230
Yeah.
Sorry.

2710
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:51,740
No,
go ahead.

2711
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:55,160
We get into this a lot.
I and I don't mean the dea,

2712
02:10:55,161 --> 02:10:57,170
like I've heard the exact same thing 
about the dea.

2713
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:58,120
Like they don't,
they,

2714
02:10:58,790 --> 02:11:01,130
I think people above them have 
experienced.

2715
02:11:01,420 --> 02:11:06,420
I'm not even,
I'm not even talking about people above 

2716
02:11:06,420 --> 02:11:07,120
them.
I'm talking about tendencies.

2717
02:11:07,150 --> 02:11:09,570
So like if an individual has a tendency,
right?

2718
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:13,150
Like um,
tendency.

2719
02:11:13,151 --> 02:11:16,510
So a person has a tendency than a group 
of people might have a tendency.

2720
02:11:16,511 --> 02:11:21,511
For example,
if I get a group of Swedish people 

2721
02:11:21,511 --> 02:11:23,140
together and I'd bring them to the World
Cup,

2722
02:11:23,650 --> 02:11:26,260
they're going to have the tendency to 
cheer for Sweden.

2723
02:11:26,290 --> 02:11:27,760
Right?
I'm going to bet on that.

2724
02:11:27,770 --> 02:11:29,740
I gamble on that.
There's a tendency,

2725
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:32,740
right?
My boss fucking sucks.

2726
02:11:32,741 --> 02:11:34,860
He's a fucking asshole.
Right?

2727
02:11:35,230 --> 02:11:40,230
Then you think back to the way all your 
other boss has acted and you realize 

2728
02:11:40,230 --> 02:11:40,230
like,
wait,

2729
02:11:40,230 --> 02:11:44,221
there seems to be a tendency when people
are in that position of power to behave 

2730
02:11:44,741 --> 02:11:46,100
in a certain way.
Right.

2731
02:11:46,470 --> 02:11:47,950
Hard,
hard job.

2732
02:11:48,010 --> 02:11:48,630
So,
so,

2733
02:11:48,670 --> 02:11:53,670
but what I'm saying is,
is the person who's in the position of 

2734
02:11:53,670 --> 02:11:54,850
power,
is that thing coming from inside of them

2735
02:11:54,851 --> 02:11:59,851
or is it that there something like built
in to the DNA of a leadership position?

2736
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:03,700
They say that like in the same way like 
when you got a pregnant wife,

2737
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,490
some new thing kicks in and I was 
reading about it,

2738
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:11,520
built in.
It feels like where it's like I'm 

2739
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:11,920
getting a fucking security system.
I'm fucking like,

2740
02:12:11,921 --> 02:12:12,610
you know what I mean?
I'm,

2741
02:12:12,611 --> 02:12:15,860
I want to make her safe.
I want to make sure that like we're,

2742
02:12:15,870 --> 02:12:17,860
we're saving money.
We're like,

2743
02:12:17,980 --> 02:12:19,990
you know what I mean,
I'm working harder than I've ever worked

2744
02:12:19,991 --> 02:12:24,991
in my fucking life because I want to 
make sure that like there's plenty for 

2745
02:12:24,991 --> 02:12:25,870
her and plenty for the kid and like 
something kicks in.

2746
02:12:25,871 --> 02:12:27,430
There is a tendency there.
Right?

2747
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:32,820
So what I'm saying is if there seems to 
be a tendency that happens when there is

2748
02:12:35,021 --> 02:12:35,750
a,
uh,

2749
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:38,800
a convergence of people in power,
right?

2750
02:12:38,950 --> 02:12:42,460
It starts behaving in a certain way.
It builds walls,

2751
02:12:42,461 --> 02:12:46,150
it starts taking people to jail who 
don't belong in jail.

2752
02:12:46,420 --> 02:12:50,200
It dehumanizes essentially.
That's the fucking tendency,

2753
02:12:50,201 --> 02:12:55,201
right?
And so when you're taking a psychedelic 

2754
02:12:55,201 --> 02:12:55,390
and you look around and you realize,
oh,

2755
02:12:55,391 --> 02:13:00,391
I see the government though,
it's filled with people who are 

2756
02:13:00,391 --> 02:13:04,651
wonderful.
There are people in the fucking dea who 

2757
02:13:04,651 --> 02:13:05,440
listened to your show and guaranteed 
love the show.

2758
02:13:05,441 --> 02:13:06,730
And I'm like,
you're fucking right man.

2759
02:13:06,731 --> 02:13:08,710
I don't want to enforce these goddamn 
laws.

2760
02:13:08,711 --> 02:13:13,711
Arresting people for a thing that is 
like being shown not only to be 

2761
02:13:13,711 --> 02:13:14,620
harmless,
but potentially therapeutic.

2762
02:13:15,190 --> 02:13:20,190
There's people in all branches of 
government and there's some people who 

2763
02:13:20,190 --> 02:13:20,440
just need a job and maybe there's some 
assholes in there.

2764
02:13:20,630 --> 02:13:25,630
Well,
there's some people that want to bus 

2765
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:26,921
crack dealers.
You want to bust assholes that are 

2766
02:13:26,921 --> 02:13:26,921
killing people,
happen to also be drug dealers.

2767
02:13:26,921 --> 02:13:31,781
And this is part of the job.
So I'm not talking about the individual 

2768
02:13:31,781 --> 02:13:32,400
atomic structure

2769
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:37,400
of the power structure,
I'm talking about the sum total 

2770
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:41,451
convergence,
the gestalt of the thing imminate 

2771
02:13:41,451 --> 02:13:44,100
certain behavior patterns and those 
fucking behavior patterns.

2772
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:49,370
Those behavior patterns have been going 
on for a very long time and so forever,

2773
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:52,440
forever as far as we know,
there's always been kings.

2774
02:13:52,470 --> 02:13:56,070
So now I'm not saying therefore your 
fear,

2775
02:13:56,071 --> 02:14:01,071
your terror is unjustified.
I just think maybe because of the 

2776
02:14:01,071 --> 02:14:04,550
garishness of the current administration
compared to like Obama who is like,

2777
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:08,530
you know,
we know what happened with Obama and,

2778
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:11,430
and I say we know what happened with 
Obama and the drones.

2779
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:13,170
We know what happened.
Well,

2780
02:14:13,171 --> 02:14:15,870
we don't know what all the shit that 
probably happened with Obama,

2781
02:14:16,050 --> 02:14:21,050
but we do know with Obama,
and I remember hearing this and then 

2782
02:14:21,050 --> 02:14:21,960
looking it up and then looking it up 
again.

2783
02:14:22,710 --> 02:14:24,840
Uh,
he apparently liked deported.

2784
02:14:24,841 --> 02:14:27,030
In fact,
maybe please find out if I'm wrong about

2785
02:14:27,031 --> 02:14:27,230
this.

2786
02:14:27,250 --> 02:14:30,600
I don't have to deal with 7 billion 
people calling me a fucking motherfucker

2787
02:14:30,601 --> 02:14:35,601
for the rest of my life.
But apparently he deported more people 

2788
02:14:35,601 --> 02:14:38,370
than any than all American presidents 
combined.

2789
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:40,050
His administration did.
Right.

2790
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:41,550
Deported more people.
Yeah,

2791
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:42,360
yeah,
yeah.

2792
02:14:42,361 --> 02:14:42,810
And,
and,

2793
02:14:42,811 --> 02:14:45,060
and so now trump,
he,

2794
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:47,810
he's at the beginning of the fucking 
deportation race.

2795
02:14:47,811 --> 02:14:52,811
Like by the time he's done,
he might have beaten Obama and score by 

2796
02:14:52,811 --> 02:14:52,811
a long shot.
I don't fucking know.

2797
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:55,530
But the main thing is what I'm saying 
here is like,

2798
02:14:55,890 --> 02:15:00,890
I think I've been aware of the fact that
there is something wonky going on and 

2799
02:15:01,741 --> 02:15:04,630
it's wonky in the most rotten brutal 
way.

2800
02:15:04,631 --> 02:15:07,830
It's wonky in the sense that it kills 
people.

2801
02:15:08,070 --> 02:15:11,970
It separates children from families,
not just of immigrants,

2802
02:15:11,971 --> 02:15:16,971
but if farmers,
some people were growing marijuana and 

2803
02:15:16,971 --> 02:15:19,500
guaranteed their kids are in foster care
now and they're in fucking jail.

2804
02:15:19,650 --> 02:15:22,080
Right.
This has been going on and on and on and

2805
02:15:22,081 --> 02:15:27,081
on.
I think maybe now it's great about the 

2806
02:15:27,081 --> 02:15:29,871
fear that we're seeing in the hyper 
reaction is if there is anything great 

2807
02:15:29,871 --> 02:15:33,330
about it,
is that people are waking up to the fact

2808
02:15:33,630 --> 02:15:38,630
that our government right now,
the American government is out of 

2809
02:15:38,630 --> 02:15:42,711
balance.
We've been at war for 90 percent of our 

2810
02:15:42,711 --> 02:15:42,711
history,
right,

2811
02:15:42,711 --> 02:15:47,660
and there's a lot of shit going on in 
there that doesn't need to be going on 

2812
02:15:47,660 --> 02:15:49,830
and we're waking up to it.
It's just some people are like,

2813
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:55,040
they're waking up to it like they were 
asleep and someone threw water in their 

2814
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:55,040
face and they're like,
oh fucking shit.

2815
02:15:55,200 --> 02:15:57,360
Holy fucking shit.
This is like,

2816
02:15:57,660 --> 02:15:58,770
you know,
this happened,

2817
02:15:59,070 --> 02:16:01,080
this sounds condescending.
I don't mean it to be,

2818
02:16:01,081 --> 02:16:06,081
but when I was like 18 or 17,
looking at a fucking dollar bell 

2819
02:16:06,081 --> 02:16:10,161
tripping balls,
looking at that fucking green pyramid 

2820
02:16:10,161 --> 02:16:10,650
and the weird symbols and then thinking 
like,

2821
02:16:10,651 --> 02:16:13,330
wait a minute,
this,

2822
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:16,980
this is covered with a cult symbology 
all over it,

2823
02:16:17,110 --> 02:16:18,510
all over it.
And then thinking like,

2824
02:16:18,511 --> 02:16:19,020
wait a minute,
wait,

2825
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:21,660
there's something,
this should,

2826
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:24,510
this should,
this isn't really worth anything.

2827
02:16:24,810 --> 02:16:27,960
Like this is just paper.
And then setting it on fire,

2828
02:16:28,590 --> 02:16:30,130
you know,
just to do like the worst

2829
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:35,130
thing,
like a joke obviously because it's 

2830
02:16:35,130 --> 02:16:35,130
illegal to set it on fire.
Right?

2831
02:16:35,130 --> 02:16:35,130
Yeah,
of course.

2832
02:16:35,130 --> 02:16:36,280
It's a joke.
I will never fucking do that man.

2833
02:16:36,281 --> 02:16:41,281
No Way.
I never ever in a million years would 

2834
02:16:41,281 --> 02:16:41,620
ignite currency,
not with old glory now without glory,

2835
02:16:41,621 --> 02:16:46,621
not with the fucking money,
but I guess what I'm saying is like if 

2836
02:16:46,621 --> 02:16:49,830
there is something positive about and I,
the mobs of people doing this or that or

2837
02:16:49,831 --> 02:16:53,250
the other,
the hyper outrage almost as though we're

2838
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:57,380
looking at an immune response.
Like that's kind of going over board.

2839
02:16:57,490 --> 02:16:58,600
Right?
Exactly.

2840
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:03,760
But if there's something positive in it,
it's that it seems that huge swaths of 

2841
02:17:04,301 --> 02:17:09,301
people are becoming familiar with the 
machinations of the American empire and 

2842
02:17:10,691 --> 02:17:13,750
understanding that here's how it's 
working right now.

2843
02:17:14,260 --> 02:17:15,130
And um,

2844
02:17:15,740 --> 02:17:20,740
well not only that,
like this illusion that it worked far 

2845
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:22,300
differently when Obama was in office,
like,

2846
02:17:22,430 --> 02:17:27,430
have you seen that video?
Or Obama was running for president and 

2847
02:17:27,430 --> 02:17:31,361
he started talking about how to deal 
with immigration and the immigration 

2848
02:17:31,361 --> 02:17:33,290
policies.
Now it's disturbing video because it's a

2849
02:17:33,291 --> 02:17:36,130
republican viewpoint.
He's the way he's talking about it,

2850
02:17:36,131 --> 02:17:40,190
it sounds like someone running for a 
conservative position now.

2851
02:17:40,350 --> 02:17:43,700
It's not like this democratic socialist 
idea of eliminating ice.

2852
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:49,120
You know,
there's a lot of people that are there 

2853
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:49,240
ideas that immigration,
customs enforcement,

2854
02:17:49,290 --> 02:17:52,180
those people are monsters and we should 
eliminate the position.

2855
02:17:52,210 --> 02:17:54,260
We shouldn't have it anymore and we 
should have open borders.

2856
02:17:54,770 --> 02:17:59,770
And those,
those same people would love to have 

2857
02:17:59,770 --> 02:17:59,770
Obama in office.
You know,

2858
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:01,130
they would think that it would be great 
if Obama was here.

2859
02:18:01,131 --> 02:18:06,131
Boy,
who was so much better when Obama was 

2860
02:18:06,131 --> 02:18:06,131
here.
Back play that video,

2861
02:18:06,131 --> 02:18:07,160
find the video of Obama.
Uh,

2862
02:18:07,161 --> 02:18:12,161
I think it was,
I want to say 2007 or eight or something

2863
02:18:14,291 --> 02:18:15,580
like that,
something like that.

2864
02:18:16,510 --> 02:18:17,950
But it's one of those ones where you're 
like,

2865
02:18:17,951 --> 02:18:19,030
Whoa,
wait a minute,

2866
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:21,100
what?
Two thousand five.

2867
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:23,890
You watch it and you go,
what?

2868
02:18:24,140 --> 02:18:24,940
Yeah.
Wow.

2869
02:18:24,941 --> 02:18:27,100
Like this sounds like a Republican.
Like imagine.

2870
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:32,160
Let's just imagine and imagine this is a
young blonde white man who's saying this

2871
02:18:34,451 --> 02:18:36,460
in 2018.
Listen to this,

2872
02:18:36,461 --> 02:18:38,290
listen to listen to is his position

2873
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:43,540
dude with one of us is like square on 
the need to better secure the border at 

2874
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:48,340
a punish employers who choose to hire 
illegal immigrants.

2875
02:18:48,730 --> 02:18:53,730
You know,
we are a generous and welcoming people 

2876
02:18:53,730 --> 02:18:56,131
here in the United States,
but those who entered the country 

2877
02:18:56,131 --> 02:18:57,550
illegally and those who employ them 
disrespect the rule of law.

2878
02:18:57,551 --> 02:18:58,480
Wait,
can you pause that?

2879
02:18:58,481 --> 02:18:59,230
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

2880
02:18:59,231 --> 02:19:03,130
May I ask for a pots?
What's the date on that video?

2881
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:04,840
Two thousand five,
that's for sure.

2882
02:19:04,841 --> 02:19:07,730
The date on the actual upload.
Flashback 2005,

2883
02:19:07,731 --> 02:19:08,110
seven,
zero.

2884
02:19:08,250 --> 02:19:08,930
S,
uh,

2885
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:13,540
Senator Obama and immigration.
You use 31st 2017.

2886
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:14,740
Okay.
Now here's the thing,

2887
02:19:14,741 --> 02:19:16,450
man,
his lips.

2888
02:19:16,451 --> 02:19:18,280
Look,
I be bullshit.

2889
02:19:18,370 --> 02:19:23,370
I've looked at that.
Obama has deported more people than any 

2890
02:19:23,370 --> 02:19:26,761
American president,
but we have to be very careful these 

2891
02:19:26,761 --> 02:19:26,761
days because if you look,
his lips aren't tracking.

2892
02:19:26,761 --> 02:19:26,890
Oh,
let me see.

2893
02:19:26,950 --> 02:19:27,650
Let me see.
Yeah,

2894
02:19:27,651 --> 02:19:28,130
go back

2895
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:33,130
and look at the or showing disregard for
those who are following the law cannot 

2896
02:19:34,630 --> 02:19:35,330
come out.
Yeah.

2897
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:37,010
Oh yeah.
Does not tracking it all?

2898
02:19:37,190 --> 02:19:37,850
Well,
why don't you?

2899
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:42,880
Well,
someone would know if that was a real 

2900
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:44,771
cspan thing.
I think we need to better secure the 

2901
02:19:44,771 --> 02:19:48,650
border and a punish employers choose to 
hire illegal immigrants.

2902
02:19:48,730 --> 02:19:50,690
I'm not saying this because I'm shocked 
that yeah,

2903
02:19:50,691 --> 02:19:53,090
but it's just off,
but it's the same words.

2904
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:55,990
They all agree.
He's saying the same words.

2905
02:19:56,170 --> 02:19:58,520
Can we find a version of it where it 
doesn't do that?

2906
02:19:58,540 --> 02:19:59,920
Sorry,
you guys these days,

2907
02:19:59,921 --> 02:20:01,600
man.
I like so like,

2908
02:20:01,630 --> 02:20:04,130
and this is how we're going to deal with
even more like.

2909
02:20:04,210 --> 02:20:06,430
And also I'm not saying like you would 
never do that.

2910
02:20:06,580 --> 02:20:08,620
I'm just saying that looks a little 
fishy,

2911
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:13,800
but you can just look up.
Did Obama deported more people than 

2912
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:13,800
those looking at it

2913
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:17,870
before you asked me to fund the video 
and I'm finding various problems in 

2914
02:20:17,870 --> 02:20:19,110
that,
that statement or statistics.

2915
02:20:19,111 --> 02:20:24,111
So snopes has it,
but they've changed it to a mixture 

2916
02:20:24,111 --> 02:20:26,901
instead of being true or false because 
the definition of a deportation was 

2917
02:20:26,901 --> 02:20:28,200
changed at some point in the last couple
of years.

2918
02:20:28,201 --> 02:20:28,410
The

2919
02:20:28,410 --> 02:20:30,690
point is he deported a lot of people,
you know,

2920
02:20:30,691 --> 02:20:31,510
like,
I don't know,

2921
02:20:31,511 --> 02:20:32,650
like how many are.
I don't know.

2922
02:20:32,651 --> 02:20:37,651
It wasn't Justin Trudeau.
He wasn't just open borders that nobody 

2923
02:20:37,651 --> 02:20:37,651
in.
But dude,

2924
02:20:37,651 --> 02:20:40,380
let's please find out if that fucking 
clip was actually sitting.

2925
02:20:40,381 --> 02:20:42,660
We would know.
We would know if that clip is bullshit.

2926
02:20:42,661 --> 02:20:46,080
There's no way they would just let it 
slide if Obama never said that.

2927
02:20:46,081 --> 02:20:49,000
There's no way they would just let that 
stay was sinked.

2928
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:54,280
Well then you would kind of know because
that's a pretty famous clip and it gets 

2929
02:20:54,280 --> 02:20:56,920
used all the time.
She spends website,

2930
02:20:56,921 --> 02:21:01,921
right?
We all agree on the need to better 

2931
02:21:01,921 --> 02:21:04,461
secure what's up with the fucking dream 
was declared illegal immigrants.

2932
02:21:06,010 --> 02:21:08,940
We are a generous and welcoming people 
still offstage.

2933
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:14,520
So yeah.
You guys are also watching a version 

2934
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:14,520
that's going through three different.
Are you watching it?

2935
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:16,440
When was it published?
When was that uploaded?

2936
02:21:16,470 --> 02:21:18,630
This was uploaded 2005.
Okay,

2937
02:21:18,631 --> 02:21:19,380
great.
Perfect.

2938
02:21:19,381 --> 02:21:21,270
Sorry you guys.
You've got to be careful these days.

2939
02:21:21,271 --> 02:21:23,130
That man,
because they're fucking putting out shit

2940
02:21:23,131 --> 02:21:24,670
that looks real.
That is not.

2941
02:21:24,810 --> 02:21:27,840
I listened to that radio lab one where 
they were showing how good it is today.

2942
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:29,700
It's fucking.
It's close.

2943
02:21:29,740 --> 02:21:31,530
It's real close to being 
indistinguishable.

2944
02:21:31,531 --> 02:21:33,090
Especially for you and I.
Yeah.

2945
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:38,150
You and I have hundreds of hours of us 
talking shit and saying things that are 

2946
02:21:38,150 --> 02:21:38,390
ridiculous.
I mean,

2947
02:21:38,410 --> 02:21:43,410
we have,
you and I together probably have over a 

2948
02:21:43,410 --> 02:21:44,790
hundred podcasts.
We've done way TC that stupid shit.

2949
02:21:44,791 --> 02:21:46,080
People make us say,
man,

2950
02:21:46,081 --> 02:21:51,081
I,
it's going to be so fucking 

2951
02:21:51,081 --> 02:21:53,640
embarrassing.
It's embarrassing for you if you watch 

2952
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:56,091
it,
like there's a million things to watch 

2953
02:21:56,091 --> 02:21:56,091
and to watch people put words in your 
mouth.

2954
02:21:56,091 --> 02:21:56,091
Yeah.
You don't have to keep moving,

2955
02:21:56,280 --> 02:21:57,300
keep moving.
But Dude,

2956
02:21:57,301 --> 02:22:02,301
let's get back to this.
I like this topic here that we're 

2957
02:22:02,301 --> 02:22:02,710
talking about,
which is like this.

2958
02:22:03,290 --> 02:22:05,670
There's A.
There's an imbalance here.

2959
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:10,760
There's definitely an imbalance.
I think that imbalance is being exposed 

2960
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:15,141
by peoples' real opinion and this is one
of the reasons why actual education and 

2961
02:22:15,141 --> 02:22:19,340
actual like raising of human beings is 
going to be in critically,

2962
02:22:19,410 --> 02:22:24,410
critically important.
Whereas we ignored it as being not for 

2963
02:22:24,410 --> 02:22:24,410
awhile.
Well,

2964
02:22:24,410 --> 02:22:26,460
it's way more important now because the 
community

2965
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:31,460
has gotten closer than ever.
The community of humans and by not 

2966
02:22:31,460 --> 02:22:35,121
respecting this community and not really
concentrating on the way people behave 

2967
02:22:36,301 --> 02:22:41,301
and think rather than what they own or 
what their job title is or what degree 

2968
02:22:41,521 --> 02:22:44,130
they have,
instead of concentrating on the.

2969
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:49,160
One of the things that's most important 
for us is the way we interact with each 

2970
02:22:49,160 --> 02:22:49,160
other,
right?

2971
02:22:49,160 --> 02:22:49,280
Um,
we,

2972
02:22:49,540 --> 02:22:53,940
we have created this issue where now 
that everyone has a word in,

2973
02:22:54,330 --> 02:22:57,390
you've got all these broken people chime
in,

2974
02:22:57,391 --> 02:23:02,391
in throwing an insult bombs and look,
anytime a woman is in the news who does 

2975
02:23:02,671 --> 02:23:07,671
something remotely questionable,
the color of brigade comes out in full 

2976
02:23:08,281 --> 02:23:13,281
force on twitter and it's all these fake
accounts and eggs and some people in 

2977
02:23:13,281 --> 02:23:15,690
real accounts and just want attention 
and they just attack.

2978
02:23:15,900 --> 02:23:16,840
I mean,
this is just a,

2979
02:23:16,841 --> 02:23:18,930
this is a real thing and it's not just 
women,

2980
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:21,120
but they do it to men,
to women.

2981
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:23,790
It always takes on a particularly 
viable,

2982
02:23:23,940 --> 02:23:28,940
creepy.
It's like finally I get to say this 

2983
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:28,940
thing and what?
Well,

2984
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:28,940
what has happened there?
Well,

2985
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:29,880
somebody's got raised badly.
Somebody,

2986
02:23:29,910 --> 02:23:34,910
somebody did a terrible job raising a 
man that got them to this position with 

2987
02:23:34,910 --> 02:23:38,490
this broken bundle of emotions and 
memories and they're all fucked up with 

2988
02:23:38,490 --> 02:23:42,801
no self esteem.
And then they find some little target 

2989
02:23:42,801 --> 02:23:42,801
online.
Whatever it is,

2990
02:23:42,801 --> 02:23:43,440
fuck you Duncan Trussell,
you fucking sell out,

2991
02:23:43,441 --> 02:23:45,000
faggot.
And next thing you know,

2992
02:23:45,090 --> 02:23:50,090
they're attacking you and you might just
be about to go to the movies with your 

2993
02:23:50,090 --> 02:23:50,090
wife and you read that,
like,

2994
02:23:50,090 --> 02:23:51,000
what the fuck is this guy's problem,
man,

2995
02:23:51,001 --> 02:23:56,001
I didn't do anything.
You put your phone down and you go into 

2996
02:23:56,001 --> 02:23:56,490
that theater and you're all pissed off 
and fucking tweet him back,

2997
02:23:56,850 --> 02:23:58,510
but you should this.
You can't.

2998
02:23:58,560 --> 02:23:59,250
There's too many people.

2999
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:00,480
There's too many people.
Too many people.

3000
02:24:01,100 --> 02:24:03,840
The bad thing is you're going to miss a 
lot of good people,

3001
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:07,050
but the good thing is you're going to 
put a lot out.

3002
02:24:07,410 --> 02:24:07,820
Look.
You Go.

3003
02:24:07,860 --> 02:24:12,860
You have to put a lot of good out there,
but you can't dwell too much in the 

3004
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:12,860
back.
We're going to get through this.

3005
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:16,260
This is a tumultuous adolescent stage of
human interaction.

3006
02:24:16,261 --> 02:24:16,940
Yeah,
that's right.

3007
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:21,950
That's what's happening.
We're going to get through this and 

3008
02:24:21,950 --> 02:24:23,781
reach a much higher level of 
understanding of each other in a higher 

3009
02:24:23,781 --> 02:24:27,741
level of understanding of community and 
this is why all these school shootings 

3010
02:24:27,741 --> 02:24:31,911
are happening and all this chaos and 
people driving trucks into crowds and 

3011
02:24:31,911 --> 02:24:36,141
shit.
It's because people are feeling out of 

3012
02:24:36,141 --> 02:24:36,141
this,
this,

3013
02:24:36,141 --> 02:24:37,500
this project of civilization and 
culture.

3014
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:42,680
They feel horribly suicidal and 
depressed and confused and hateful and 

3015
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:47,331
angry and they're filled up with 
chemicals and pharmaceuticals and 

3016
02:24:47,331 --> 02:24:51,261
loneliness and despair and anger and 
resentment and religious fervor and 

3017
02:24:51,990 --> 02:24:56,730
whatever the fuck else is pushing them 
through this life and then they react.

3018
02:24:56,730 --> 02:24:59,910
They explode and this more explode all 
over the place,

3019
02:24:59,911 --> 02:25:01,920
but we got to take away the tools of 
explosion.

3020
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:07,000
No,
you've got to figure out why people are 

3021
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,841
exploding.
How come no one is concentrating on why 

3022
02:25:08,841 --> 02:25:10,480
people were exposed was exploding every 
once the women want to go,

3023
02:25:10,481 --> 02:25:12,780
it's toxic masculinity and the men want 
to go.

3024
02:25:12,781 --> 02:25:17,781
We're raising pussies and nobody wants 
to figure out what the fuck it is and 

3025
02:25:17,781 --> 02:25:19,780
they just hope that it doesn't happen 
again and then it happens again.

3026
02:25:19,781 --> 02:25:24,781
In the argument starts up and Ted nugent
calls everybody at coc and the fucking 

3027
02:25:24,781 --> 02:25:29,490
people that want to guns taken away.
They all fucking storm in and they 

3028
02:25:29,490 --> 02:25:33,700
demand and they ended the streak in 
front of the senator's house at 2:00

3029
02:25:33,701 --> 02:25:37,270
in the morning.
Brigade roles in copper grade rolls in.

3030
02:25:37,271 --> 02:25:39,480
They started tweeting up a storm.
Yeah.

3031
02:25:39,570 --> 02:25:40,360
Yeah,
and this is,

3032
02:25:40,361 --> 02:25:45,361
this is where we're at,
where we're not examining the behavior 

3033
02:25:45,361 --> 02:25:46,030
and the development of the human being.

3034
02:25:46,030 --> 02:25:51,030
It's a nonissue in our culture.
It's one of the most important things 

3035
02:25:51,030 --> 02:25:54,091
about being a person.
You got to wait till you get to be 30 

3036
02:25:54,091 --> 02:25:54,091
and he'd take a fuck.
An Anthony Robbins seminar.

3037
02:25:54,091 --> 02:25:58,691
I try to get your shit together with 
some Voodoo preacher down in Malibu 

3038
02:25:58,691 --> 02:26:02,341
that's doing some rock and roll church 
Christian thing and all the cool people 

3039
02:26:02,341 --> 02:26:02,450
go,
oh Jeez.

3040
02:26:03,710 --> 02:26:05,460
Oh Jeez.
Oh,

3041
02:26:05,470 --> 02:26:10,470
it's amazing.
The guy plays piano and he fucks 

3042
02:26:10,470 --> 02:26:10,470
everybody.
He can.

3043
02:26:10,470 --> 02:26:10,540
It's chaos.
This is where we are.

3044
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:15,640
This is where we are.
We're this tumultuous stage where all 

3045
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:19,051
this information's flowing around and we
got to come up with management skills 

3046
02:26:19,051 --> 02:26:21,730
management skills for behavior and 
communication.

3047
02:26:21,740 --> 02:26:26,740
That's right.
And we have to recognize that we're all 

3048
02:26:26,740 --> 02:26:26,740
in this together.
Dude,

3049
02:26:26,740 --> 02:26:28,770
I love that description is such a 
perfect description and I think that's,

3050
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:29,460
uh,
that's,

3051
02:26:29,720 --> 02:26:33,510
that's the main thing for everyone is 
freaked out to remind themselves stuff.

3052
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:34,310
It's like,
yeah,

3053
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:38,780
of course you're freaked out.
Of course you should be the right way to

3054
02:26:38,781 --> 02:26:40,690
feel in a snow storm.
This is,

3055
02:26:40,830 --> 02:26:43,340
you're going to feel like I can't quite 
see what's up.

3056
02:26:43,540 --> 02:26:46,880
So like definitely I have to be more 
compassionate when I,

3057
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:52,000
when I see people are super freaking out
because sometimes I judge them and then 

3058
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:56,020
they should be.
We all have to be more compassionate to 

3059
02:26:56,020 --> 02:26:56,020
ourselves.
But then,

3060
02:26:56,020 --> 02:27:00,131
so if this is the state of chaos and 
you're talking about management skills,

3061
02:27:00,741 --> 02:27:03,020
so to speak,
this is a thing.

3062
02:27:03,770 --> 02:27:08,770
This Guy Jack Kornfield,
who I have in my podcast sometimes 

3063
02:27:08,770 --> 02:27:08,770
taught me,
this guy's an he's amazing.

3064
02:27:08,770 --> 02:27:13,660
He's a Buddhist teacher,
but he says tend to the part of the 

3065
02:27:14,221 --> 02:27:16,380
garden that you can touch.
Right.

3066
02:27:16,890 --> 02:27:21,110
And I think that is such incredible,
incredible instructors agree with.

3067
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:22,200
Put it.
Yeah,

3068
02:27:22,201 --> 02:27:23,300
that's a great way to put it.
Yeah.

3069
02:27:23,301 --> 02:27:24,020
So,
so it's,

3070
02:27:24,021 --> 02:27:29,021
it's like in all that chaos that you 
just described where like you see the 

3071
02:27:29,021 --> 02:27:31,230
thing and you realize like whatever it 
may be,

3072
02:27:31,231 --> 02:27:33,270
the thing,
the school shooting,

3073
02:27:33,510 --> 02:27:35,760
the immigration,
the bus,

3074
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:37,820
that whatever,
and you really,

3075
02:27:38,030 --> 02:27:38,770
you,
you,

3076
02:27:38,900 --> 02:27:43,680
you get this in sad feeling,
there's nothing I can do about that.

3077
02:27:43,681 --> 02:27:46,920
And so you end up online,
you're scared.

3078
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:50,580
Fear in Buddhism is cold.
Anger.

3079
02:27:50,610 --> 02:27:53,190
Like when fear gets hot,
it turns into anger.

3080
02:27:53,191 --> 02:27:58,191
So you're going to turn,
you're going to be angry because you're 

3081
02:27:58,191 --> 02:28:01,041
scared,
and then you start firing these shots 

3082
02:28:01,041 --> 02:28:02,550
online in the entire time you're doing 
that,

3083
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:07,830
the entire time you're doing that,
your mother who lives at the other,

3084
02:28:07,831 --> 02:28:12,831
you know,
somewhere in the middle of the country 

3085
02:28:12,831 --> 02:28:15,410
is living by herself in a house where 
she doesn't have enough money and the 

3086
02:28:15,901 --> 02:28:19,590
house is dilapidated and you haven't 
been paying attention to her.

3087
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:21,890
She needs your fucking help,
right?

3088
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:27,130
It's not time for you necessarily,
even though your aspiration to rebalance

3089
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:31,760
a democracy is beautiful and we all want
that.

3090
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:38,210
You're fucking neglecting one of your 
best friends,

3091
02:28:38,570 --> 02:28:40,220
not your mom.
You know what I'm saying?

3092
02:28:40,230 --> 02:28:45,230
So someone you know is exhibiting like 
some fucking behaviors that are like 

3093
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:49,070
awful little bit or like somebody in 
your neighborhood or you know,

3094
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:53,450
so it's like the whole time your mind 
through anger is focusing on the fucking

3095
02:28:53,451 --> 02:28:56,630
press secretary.
Who,

3096
02:28:56,690 --> 02:28:57,830
by the way,
Joe,

3097
02:28:58,250 --> 02:29:01,700
I don't think the press secretary,
I could be totally off on this,

3098
02:29:02,300 --> 02:29:05,870
but you want to talk about shooting the 
fucking messenger man,

3099
02:29:10,860 --> 02:29:15,860
that's it.
You perfect day when she's the 

3100
02:29:15,860 --> 02:29:15,860
Messenger.

3101
02:29:15,860 --> 02:29:15,860
Literally.
Yeah.

3102
02:29:15,860 --> 02:29:18,710
You know what I mean like that,
that woman like that.

3103
02:29:18,711 --> 02:29:23,711
That is a messenger like is she.
Does she have the most pleasing 

3104
02:29:23,711 --> 02:29:26,120
personality?
Do you agree with her politics?

3105
02:29:26,330 --> 02:29:27,830
Probably not,
but like,

3106
02:29:28,010 --> 02:29:30,150
come on man,
I'll tell you this morning,

3107
02:29:30,151 --> 02:29:30,640
imagine

3108
02:29:30,640 --> 02:29:32,500
if she didn't have that kind of 
personality.

3109
02:29:32,510 --> 02:29:37,510
Imagine if she was cheerful and she went
up there and Jim Costa was fucking 

3110
02:29:37,510 --> 02:29:38,410
screaming at her that his name,
Acosta,

3111
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:43,440
whatever his name is,
but that guy gets heckled everywhere he 

3112
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:45,641
goes.
Now they put signs up behind him and 

3113
02:29:45,641 --> 02:29:45,641
say,
CNN sucks.

3114
02:29:45,641 --> 02:29:47,350
There's some really fun things about the
trump administration,

3115
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:52,500
some really fun things,
and one of the fun things is these 

3116
02:29:52,500 --> 02:29:52,810
people that are journalists that takes 
themselves super serious,

3117
02:29:52,890 --> 02:29:55,420
are they getting shit on for the first 
time?

3118
02:29:55,750 --> 02:29:56,560
I mean,
they're getting.

3119
02:29:57,310 --> 02:30:00,580
They're getting called out for some of 
their ridiculous behavior,

3120
02:30:00,581 --> 02:30:03,340
like yelling out questions during the 
press conference,

3121
02:30:03,341 --> 02:30:08,341
like your questions more important than 
all the people around you that might be 

3122
02:30:08,341 --> 02:30:11,311
politely raising their hand.
You've decided you need the world needs 

3123
02:30:11,311 --> 02:30:12,880
to know the world needs to know and they
get to hold these people,

3124
02:30:12,940 --> 02:30:14,020
hold their feet to the fire.

3125
02:30:14,320 --> 02:30:15,730
Okay.
Maybe,

3126
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:17,890
maybe.
Maybe this is not the way to communicate

3127
02:30:17,891 --> 02:30:22,891
with people ever.
Maybe this maxine waters idea of like 

3128
02:30:22,891 --> 02:30:26,070
getting people to protest people in 
restaurants and build a crowd and let 

3129
02:30:26,070 --> 02:30:27,070
them know that they're not welcome.
Okay.

3130
02:30:27,071 --> 02:30:29,410
Maybe that's the only way,
right?

3131
02:30:29,411 --> 02:30:34,411
Let's just play devil's advocate.
If you're looking at all these people 

3132
02:30:34,411 --> 02:30:34,960
that are imposing these immoral 
policies,

3133
02:30:35,110 --> 02:30:38,410
separating children from their parents,
which seems to be the most egregious.

3134
02:30:38,411 --> 02:30:40,540
That's the one that bothers us the most.
Everyone.

3135
02:30:40,660 --> 02:30:42,640
Yeah.
That's the one that's most horrific.

3136
02:30:42,820 --> 02:30:45,520
So how Amia bombing them?
Yeah,

3137
02:30:45,521 --> 02:30:46,160
that's crazy.
Well,

3138
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:48,130
we know that that's far away.
That's not here,

3139
02:30:48,460 --> 02:30:51,160
but how do you stop that?
If you just let it happen?

3140
02:30:51,161 --> 02:30:56,161
These smiling demons just pass these 
laws and laugh in your face and there's 

3141
02:30:56,161 --> 02:30:57,010
no push back.
That doesn't work.

3142
02:30:57,011 --> 02:30:58,990
So what's the pushback?
How do you get push back?

3143
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:03,130
This is where it gets weird.
They might have a point.

3144
02:31:03,340 --> 02:31:08,340
Okay.
If you're dealing with something that's 

3145
02:31:08,340 --> 02:31:08,340
that disgusting,
as long as there's no actual violence.

3146
02:31:08,340 --> 02:31:10,110
If you're dealing with something that's 
so heinous,

3147
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:12,520
you're separating poor people from their
parents.

3148
02:31:12,521 --> 02:31:17,521
So they're just coming over here trying 
to take a chance to get a migrant labor 

3149
02:31:17,521 --> 02:31:18,850
ward job and they're trying to pick 
strawberries or something.

3150
02:31:19,110 --> 02:31:20,130
And then you have ice come

3151
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:22,840
in and steal them from their kids and 
still their kids from them and yeah,

3152
02:31:22,890 --> 02:31:24,510
no you don't.
You can't come over here.

3153
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:26,160
Who are you protecting?
Man?

3154
02:31:26,190 --> 02:31:31,190
Who's who?
Who were they competing with to get 

3155
02:31:31,190 --> 02:31:31,190
these fucking strawberry picking jobs?
Nobody.

3156
02:31:31,190 --> 02:31:32,310
This is bullshit,
right?

3157
02:31:32,430 --> 02:31:34,180
How do you stop that from happening 
while about.

3158
02:31:34,220 --> 02:31:39,220
What about the law?
So in the middle until this log gets 

3159
02:31:39,220 --> 02:31:40,350
changed,
we reconsider the humane aspects of this

3160
02:31:40,351 --> 02:31:42,450
law.
How many people's lives are going to get

3161
02:31:42,451 --> 02:31:47,451
ruined,
how many thousands of kids are going to 

3162
02:31:47,451 --> 02:31:49,820
get traumatically separated from their 
parents and develop to become a more 

3163
02:31:49,820 --> 02:31:53,241
fucked up person who truly resents and 
hates the United States and get 

3164
02:31:53,241 --> 02:31:53,290
molested.
Advice them ice age.

3165
02:31:53,291 --> 02:31:54,900
Oh Jesus.
Could that happen?

3166
02:31:54,990 --> 02:31:57,720
It did.
I'm sure it already happened.

3167
02:31:57,960 --> 02:32:02,960
I'm sure.
I'm not surprised on you want to know 

3168
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:02,960
the story.
It's that,

3169
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:03,960
but how would you stop that?

3170
02:32:04,590 --> 02:32:09,590
I don't know how you would stop that,
but one of the only ways that I could 

3171
02:32:09,590 --> 02:32:12,441
think of being really,
really effective in getting a message 

3172
02:32:13,711 --> 02:32:18,711
across is to make it super uncomfortable
for people that push that message 

3173
02:32:18,711 --> 02:32:19,080
through.
Sure.

3174
02:32:19,160 --> 02:32:22,830
What people that support that policy.
People that think it's not a big deal.

3175
02:32:22,831 --> 02:32:27,831
Cheer.
Jeff sessions gave a speech where they 

3176
02:32:27,831 --> 02:32:31,260
made a joke about separating kids from 
their families and the audience laughed.

3177
02:32:31,590 --> 02:32:32,370
Pull that.
Pull that up.

3178
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:37,400
It's on.
It was on the cover of every new source 

3179
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:37,400
today.
Here we go.

3180
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:39,330
Fucking sessions.
But this poor little fuck,

3181
02:32:39,810 --> 02:32:42,170
it's the same thing with him.
Like this guy,

3182
02:32:42,450 --> 02:32:46,620
he just stopped evolving and he got into
this and he's not getting information.

3183
02:32:46,650 --> 02:32:47,880
He's not getting it.
He's not.

3184
02:32:47,881 --> 02:32:50,250
He's not interacting with people who's 
not evolving his ideas.

3185
02:32:50,670 --> 02:32:55,670
He stuck on this.
People who smoke marijuana are bad 

3186
02:32:55,670 --> 02:32:58,260
people face some 1930 shit.
I know he's a moron.

3187
02:32:58,470 --> 02:32:59,670
You know,
in a lot of ways,

3188
02:32:59,671 --> 02:33:01,830
and this is the product of his 
environment.

3189
02:33:01,950 --> 02:33:05,370
It's a product of his interactions and 
the ecosystem and that he exists in.

3190
02:33:05,580 --> 02:33:10,580
He exists in this bubble.
Jeff sessions speaking out about 

3191
02:33:10,580 --> 02:33:10,650
separating families

3192
02:33:10,760 --> 02:33:15,760
from the other side on this issue as on 
many others has become radicalized.

3193
02:33:16,670 --> 02:33:21,670
We hear views on television today that 
are on the lunatic fringe frankly,

3194
02:33:22,220 --> 02:33:26,570
and what is perhaps more galling is the 
epoch hypocrisy.

3195
02:33:26,960 --> 02:33:29,360
These same people live in gated 
communities,

3196
02:33:29,361 --> 02:33:34,361
many of them and our featured at events 
where you have to have an id to even 

3197
02:33:34,911 --> 02:33:39,911
come in and hear him speak.
I liked the little security around them 

3198
02:33:39,911 --> 02:33:41,600
ourselves and if you try to scale the 
fence of,

3199
02:33:41,601 --> 02:33:46,601
believe me,
they'll be even too happy to have you 

3200
02:33:46,601 --> 02:33:49,160
arrested and separated from your 
children.

3201
02:33:49,620 --> 02:33:51,990
It seemed like that joke was actually 
written for him,

3202
02:33:51,991 --> 02:33:56,991
which is interesting.
Says the fucking guy getting people 

3203
02:33:56,991 --> 02:33:57,540
arrested for marijuana.
What aloone?

3204
02:33:57,750 --> 02:33:59,800
Well,
you know,

3205
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,730
obviously fucking dummy.
There's a big difference between someone

3206
02:34:02,731 --> 02:34:05,460
breaking into your house and break it 
into the country to try to get a job.

3207
02:34:05,910 --> 02:34:08,400
You're not saying that people should 
break into people's houses.

3208
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:13,760
The main thing is jeff sessions is it 
represents something in the world and 

3209
02:34:14,340 --> 02:34:18,340
what that thing is is a force that is 
actively

3210
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:23,340
trying to reduce love in the universe 
and it's fucking rail and so that's the.

3211
02:34:26,231 --> 02:34:30,880
If you want to come up with a nice war,
a name for what's happening.

3212
02:34:30,881 --> 02:34:33,430
This revolution that's happening and it 
is,

3213
02:34:34,030 --> 02:34:35,950
is we're pushing back against that.

3214
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:37,560
Okay.
Can I be the devil's advocate?

3215
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:38,310
I'll be the devil.
Yeah,

3216
02:34:38,340 --> 02:34:39,960
sure.
That's not what he's doing.

3217
02:34:40,410 --> 02:34:45,410
He's supporting the law that we have a 
law and this is how we keep a beautiful 

3218
02:34:45,410 --> 02:34:48,921
country like America.
The reason why we have nice clean 

3219
02:34:48,921 --> 02:34:51,111
streets,
the reason why I have cops social 

3220
02:34:51,111 --> 02:34:53,451
security and it's because we have rules 
and as soon as we just allow people to 

3221
02:34:53,451 --> 02:34:57,621
bypass those rules,
people that don't agree with our way of 

3222
02:34:57,621 --> 02:34:57,621
life,
don't they?

3223
02:34:57,621 --> 02:34:57,750
They don't,
don't support our way of life.

3224
02:34:57,930 --> 02:35:00,990
They just want to come over here and 
Mooch off the system.

3225
02:35:01,170 --> 02:35:03,300
That's harder for you.
It's harder for him.

3226
02:35:03,301 --> 02:35:08,301
It's harder for everybody else.
All Johnny tax payer out there has to 

3227
02:35:08,301 --> 02:35:09,510
pay for these migrants so you don't even
know.

3228
02:35:09,511 --> 02:35:13,650
They're not even a part of your clan 
from another close by Cloud Jeff.

3229
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:16,630
But here's the bigger problem.
This is the big problem in.

3230
02:35:16,790 --> 02:35:17,120
Okay,

3231
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:21,350
and you're right.
Everything you just said,

3232
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:26,000
Mr.
sessions too legit to quit.

3233
02:35:26,070 --> 02:35:29,310
Hey,
as far as like the rules of the game and

3234
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:34,600
in some ways I guess it's true,
but like if we look at it from a bigger 

3235
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:38,651
perspective,
which you type really doesn't like at 

3236
02:35:38,651 --> 02:35:42,131
all for some reason,
but maybe it's just because you're old 

3237
02:35:42,131 --> 02:35:44,810
and your body probably hurts a little 
bit and also that fucking butt plug that

3238
02:35:44,811 --> 02:35:49,811
I would bet $200,000
that you have shoved into your asshole 

3239
02:35:49,811 --> 02:35:51,320
right now.
Think I think all the fucking time and I

3240
02:35:51,321 --> 02:35:52,860
think it's like,
I think I,

3241
02:35:52,861 --> 02:35:56,380
I get the,
I get a big bdsm vibe from that dude,

3242
02:35:56,381 --> 02:35:58,100
but that's just me.
I don't think it's true.

3243
02:35:58,101 --> 02:35:59,600
I don't know.
Here's my point,

3244
02:35:59,601 --> 02:36:01,250
man.
You know,

3245
02:36:01,350 --> 02:36:04,420
there's a bigger thing happening and 
that bigger thing is,

3246
02:36:04,870 --> 02:36:05,860
is,
is just,

3247
02:36:05,930 --> 02:36:10,930
it's for a lot of people it's 
unpalatable because it's so complex and 

3248
02:36:10,930 --> 02:36:15,071
we don't yet know how to do it,
but we live on a planet and you say this

3249
02:36:16,821 --> 02:36:19,700
all the time where we are all people.

3250
02:36:20,180 --> 02:36:23,360
We are planetariums,
we are earthlings,

3251
02:36:23,510 --> 02:36:28,510
right?
We happen to have been born into a 

3252
02:36:28,510 --> 02:36:29,360
country this country or that country.
Some of these countries have big fucking

3253
02:36:29,361 --> 02:36:34,361
walls around them because there's 
prosperity inside that country and 

3254
02:36:34,361 --> 02:36:37,841
there's prosperity inside that country 
and there's not prosperity and other 

3255
02:36:37,841 --> 02:36:39,800
places and people are suffering.
They're suffering bad,

3256
02:36:40,370 --> 02:36:41,090
bad,
bad,

3257
02:36:41,091 --> 02:36:44,480
bad suffering where it's like there,
there's like they can't.

3258
02:36:44,720 --> 02:36:47,420
They can't live in some of these places 
without getting killed,

3259
02:36:47,421 --> 02:36:52,421
for sure.
The chance of them getting killed as 

3260
02:36:52,421 --> 02:36:54,520
high for whatever reason,
and they're just doing what any living 

3261
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:55,550
organism does.
They're trying to get to a better spot.

3262
02:36:55,940 --> 02:36:57,530
Also,
Mr sessions,

3263
02:36:57,800 --> 02:37:01,310
you probably don't believe in it,
but once those fucking ice caps melt,

3264
02:37:01,670 --> 02:37:06,670
holy fuck.
When the cities in the next 50 years or 

3265
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:10,661
so become inundated with water and 
people have to start moving more and 

3266
02:37:10,661 --> 02:37:12,710
more and more from places that are 
becoming uninhabitable.

3267
02:37:12,710 --> 02:37:14,690
What do you think that's gonna Happen?
I don't know man,

3268
02:37:14,691 --> 02:37:16,400
but let's say it's.
Let's put.

3269
02:37:16,410 --> 02:37:18,710
Let's make a long date.
So what do we do Duncan?

3270
02:37:18,740 --> 02:37:20,420
We just open up the borders for 
everybody.

3271
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:21,590
Mr.
Sessions,

3272
02:37:21,740 --> 02:37:25,160
I don't fucking know,
but I can tell you this.

3273
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:28,940
If we start approaching this from the 
perspective of love,

3274
02:37:29,210 --> 02:37:34,210
which is the perspective of like we 
don't need to separate them from their 

3275
02:37:34,210 --> 02:37:35,180
kids and there might be a way to do 
this.

3276
02:37:35,330 --> 02:37:37,610
That eases their suffering a little bit 
more.

3277
02:37:37,611 --> 02:37:39,240
I don't know what it is,
but my.

3278
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:44,440
From looking at what you're doing right 
now that a net and I think we can do it 

3279
02:37:44,440 --> 02:37:45,440
better.
I don't know what it is,

3280
02:37:45,441 --> 02:37:50,441
but I think if we get a lot of people 
together and really think about it and 

3281
02:37:50,441 --> 02:37:52,730
figure it out,
I'm not talking redistribution of wealth

3282
02:37:52,731 --> 02:37:57,731
or some kind of crazy communist shit.
I'm just saying I know for sure we can 

3283
02:37:58,101 --> 02:38:02,750
do better than those God damn aluminum 
blankets you're putting on those fucking

3284
02:38:02,751 --> 02:38:04,940
kids.
Can we get a guitar player in here?

3285
02:38:05,030 --> 02:38:06,950
Hey,
maybe we can get some beds in here.

3286
02:38:06,951 --> 02:38:08,330
Is there a way to like,
you know,

3287
02:38:08,331 --> 02:38:10,160
there's just all kinds of shit we could 
do.

3288
02:38:10,161 --> 02:38:12,170
I think that's better.
What am I going to do?

3289
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:17,230
Why would that help though?
When the people are still gonna come 

3290
02:38:17,230 --> 02:38:17,230
over here.
This is going to be in prison.

3291
02:38:17,230 --> 02:38:18,030
So you play the guitar,
is that right?

3292
02:38:18,130 --> 02:38:23,130
No,
I'm not saying play the guitar to solve 

3293
02:38:23,130 --> 02:38:24,851
the immigration problem that worked.
I'm sure the immigration problem would 

3294
02:38:24,851 --> 02:38:28,181
be solved.
I'm just saying that the current 

3295
02:38:28,181 --> 02:38:29,420
methodology seems to be a little more 
sadistic than it needs to be.

3296
02:38:29,630 --> 02:38:31,610
That's all.
I don't know the answer.

3297
02:38:31,611 --> 02:38:36,611
I don't know what the answer is,
but I do know we're converging as a 

3298
02:38:36,611 --> 02:38:39,611
species and I would imagine that as 
technology continues to connect us,

3299
02:38:41,091 --> 02:38:44,090
we're going to be transcending 
nationalities in a way that aren't going

3300
02:38:44,091 --> 02:38:46,760
to be palatable to people like jeff 
sessions.

3301
02:38:46,761 --> 02:38:48,680
And I think that that's a,
um,

3302
02:38:49,700 --> 02:38:50,870
that's what's happened.

3303
02:38:50,900 --> 02:38:52,940
So what do we do now?
What would you like?

3304
02:38:52,941 --> 02:38:54,050
Honestly,
like,

3305
02:38:54,220 --> 02:38:56,360
I'm not jeff sessions anymore on me.
Now.

3306
02:38:56,361 --> 02:38:57,770
Me.
Hey dog again.

3307
02:38:58,850 --> 02:38:59,510
What would you do

3308
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:00,740
well for?
Okay.

3309
02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:04,000
I,
I'll give you my response to that,

3310
02:39:04,001 --> 02:39:05,740
which isn't going to be right because I 
don't really.

3311
02:39:05,950 --> 02:39:08,920
I don't understand the issue at a level 
deep enough.

3312
02:39:08,921 --> 02:39:11,230
Right?
So can I just say like one,

3313
02:39:12,650 --> 02:39:13,400
there's many,
there's,

3314
02:39:13,570 --> 02:39:16,780
it's a complex situation.
There's not one answer to it,

3315
02:39:16,780 --> 02:39:21,780
right?
You just let anybody in who's not a 

3316
02:39:21,780 --> 02:39:21,780
criminal,

3317
02:39:22,580 --> 02:39:25,040
so how do we did it's hard to get in.
How do we detect that?

3318
02:39:25,041 --> 02:39:25,280
Like,

3319
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:30,400
yeah,
we'd have to have some sort of faith in 

3320
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:30,400
their records so we would have to help 
their record keeping.

3321
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:34,851
So really what we want to really the way
to do it correctly is first of all,

3322
02:39:35,541 --> 02:39:37,970
anyone is attached to us,
whether it's Mexico or Canada,

3323
02:39:38,030 --> 02:39:43,030
make sure they're okay.
Make sure that they are viable and 

3324
02:39:43,030 --> 02:39:44,450
stable and help them.
That's the real thing.

3325
02:39:44,480 --> 02:39:46,640
Treat them as if they're a colony of the
United States.

3326
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,820
They're like,
not that they're not sovereign,

3327
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:54,880
that there's still Mexico,
but like treat them like they are 

3328
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:57,851
connected to us and we don't want them 
to be fucked up and crazy set of 

3329
02:39:57,851 --> 02:40:01,511
building up a wall.
Make it so that nobody wants to come 

3330
02:40:01,511 --> 02:40:01,511
over here.
Like,

3331
02:40:01,511 --> 02:40:02,090
that seems to be the prosperity way to 
go about it.

3332
02:40:02,091 --> 02:40:02,930
Like to say,
Hey,

3333
02:40:03,290 --> 02:40:06,560
you know,
Mexico's fucking beautiful.

3334
02:40:06,650 --> 02:40:11,650
All right.
There's a reason why people vacation in 

3335
02:40:11,650 --> 02:40:11,650
Mexico.
It's fucking amazing.

3336
02:40:11,650 --> 02:40:12,990
Okay.
You go to Poland,

3337
02:40:13,220 --> 02:40:13,920
Mita

3338
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:19,070
or a fucking Puerto Vallarta or cabo or.
Yeah,

3339
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:23,190
to loom,
there's it's fucking beautiful.

3340
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:28,460
The idea that it's beautiful and also 
dangerous and scary and filled with 

3341
02:40:28,460 --> 02:40:29,190
crime.
That's fucking stupid.

3342
02:40:29,610 --> 02:40:30,360
So then you would go,
well,

3343
02:40:30,361 --> 02:40:32,460
what's the problem here?
What's the problem here is drugs.

3344
02:40:32,461 --> 02:40:36,040
Illegal drugs are illegal in the United 
States wants to buy a bunch of drugs.

3345
02:40:36,041 --> 02:40:37,980
So all these people making billions of 
dollars selling drugs,

3346
02:40:38,190 --> 02:40:39,990
there's only one way to do that.
You've got to kill cops.

3347
02:40:40,170 --> 02:40:41,940
You got to kill cops,
kill rats.

3348
02:40:41,941 --> 02:40:46,941
You gotta kill rivals.
You got to kill whoever the fuck you 

3349
02:40:46,941 --> 02:40:46,941
gotta kill and you've got to send a 
message.

3350
02:40:46,941 --> 02:40:49,260
You've got to hang people from fucking 
bridges and shit.

3351
02:40:49,261 --> 02:40:54,261
Yeah,
you got to do things to send a message 

3352
02:40:54,261 --> 02:40:54,900
that you're ruthless and you're here to 
get that money and there's a lot of that

3353
02:40:54,901 --> 02:40:58,950
going on and that is no different than 
Al Capone during the fucking prohibition

3354
02:40:58,951 --> 02:41:01,080
of alcohol in the United States of 
America.

3355
02:41:01,240 --> 02:41:06,240
It's the same God damned thing.
You make something illegal that 

3356
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:06,660
everybody wants and only criminals are 
willing to sell it and boom,

3357
02:41:06,661 --> 02:41:09,630
you got a thriving criminal economy.
There you go.

3358
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:14,660
And so we're stuck next to a thriving 
criminal economy with no management of 

3359
02:41:14,660 --> 02:41:15,240
it whatsoever other than bullets,
right?

3360
02:41:15,241 --> 02:41:20,241
So occasionally they throw some bullets 
into these people and then they come 

3361
02:41:20,241 --> 02:41:22,821
back stronger than ever because there's 
more drug money and there's less of 

3362
02:41:22,821 --> 02:41:25,731
them.
And the one person gets stronger and El 

3363
02:41:25,731 --> 02:41:28,280
Chapo digs a fucking hole,
a mile through the ground and gets out 

3364
02:41:28,280 --> 02:41:28,280
of jail again.
The whole thing is crazy,

3365
02:41:28,280 --> 02:41:31,320
but this is what we're next to.
And so instead of saying,

3366
02:41:31,321 --> 02:41:36,321
hey,
we got to make a fucking wall and make 

3367
02:41:36,321 --> 02:41:37,831
it.
What we should be saying is what do we 

3368
02:41:37,831 --> 02:41:40,671
have to do to not just fix Mexico,
not just help them and come up with some

3369
02:41:41,161 --> 02:41:44,610
sort of strategy and a plan to build 
them up almost as equals.

3370
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:46,920
But we've got to fix our fucking poor 
neighborhoods.

3371
02:41:47,250 --> 02:41:52,250
We've got to fix these fucking 
neighborhoods that had been drenched in 

3372
02:41:52,250 --> 02:41:53,730
poverty since 19 twice.
How about fix them?

3373
02:41:53,970 --> 02:41:55,980
Fix them,
put some energy into it.

3374
02:41:55,981 --> 02:41:57,900
Put some planning,
hire people the same way.

3375
02:41:58,050 --> 02:42:00,450
Halliburton hires people to fucking 
rebuild shit.

3376
02:42:00,451 --> 02:42:05,451
We blow up in Iraq.
They should be hiring people to figure 

3377
02:42:05,451 --> 02:42:08,541
out how to rebuild these communities,
figure out how to give people jobs and 

3378
02:42:08,541 --> 02:42:11,580
figuring out how to develop community 
center so that kids have somewhere to go

3379
02:42:11,581 --> 02:42:16,581
there where they can learn and be 
productive so you're developing less 

3380
02:42:16,581 --> 02:42:16,581
losers,
giving people hopes and dreams,

3381
02:42:16,581 --> 02:42:18,690
giving them things that they can put 
their energy to that make them feel good

3382
02:42:18,691 --> 02:42:19,920
about life,
right,

3383
02:42:19,921 --> 02:42:23,670
give them skills and and games they can 
play and things they could do where they

3384
02:42:23,671 --> 02:42:25,590
get good at it,
where they develop self esteem,

3385
02:42:25,591 --> 02:42:30,591
which is one of the most terrible things
about growing up in an impoverished 

3386
02:42:30,591 --> 02:42:31,440
crime ridden gang infested neighborhood.

3387
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:33,660
As you feel like you're nothing.
You are nothing.

3388
02:42:33,661 --> 02:42:35,370
Your life can be taken away at any 
moment.

3389
02:42:35,371 --> 02:42:40,371
You got to be careful where you go,
but what's a fly and people getting 

3390
02:42:40,371 --> 02:42:40,380
killed.
People are killing people over words and

3391
02:42:40,381 --> 02:42:45,381
insults and fucking territory for drugs 
and your aunts on crack and your uncles 

3392
02:42:45,391 --> 02:42:49,740
in jail and it's just seems like there's
no fucking hope and no one does anything

3393
02:42:49,741 --> 02:42:50,610
about it.
No one doesn't,

3394
02:42:50,710 --> 02:42:55,710
but few people do things about it.
A lot of people dedicate their lives to 

3395
02:42:55,710 --> 02:42:58,431
it,
but it's not enough from a governmental 

3396
02:42:58,431 --> 02:42:58,431
level.
No one in the top of the organization is

3397
02:42:58,431 --> 02:43:00,510
looking at this big thing and saying 
they're all going,

3398
02:43:00,511 --> 02:43:01,860
hey,
we've got to drill more oil.

3399
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:03,450
Hey,
we got to do with the resources,

3400
02:43:03,451 --> 02:43:04,520
the resources,
the reason.

3401
02:43:04,740 --> 02:43:07,890
What about our greatest resource human 
beings?

3402
02:43:08,190 --> 02:43:12,040
The greatest way to make America great 
again is to have less losers.

3403
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:17,280
The way to have less losers is you've 
got to find the spots that are sick and 

3404
02:43:17,280 --> 02:43:17,950
healed them.
Yes.

3405
02:43:17,980 --> 02:43:20,200
Yeah.
Find these communities that are,

3406
02:43:20,230 --> 02:43:25,230
that have the momentum of poverty and 
crime and violence and it's existed for 

3407
02:43:25,230 --> 02:43:28,390
as long as we can think for decades.
Fix them,

3408
02:43:28,660 --> 02:43:33,660
fix them,
and have a concerted effort to fix them 

3409
02:43:33,660 --> 02:43:35,090
and do and bring everybody together.
Everybody together and instead of this,

3410
02:43:35,140 --> 02:43:39,100
this idea that we're all separate and 
we'll just fucking to party,

3411
02:43:39,130 --> 02:43:44,130
right?
Left nonsense is civil war to trump 

3412
02:43:44,130 --> 02:43:47,161
supporters and and,
and people want to kick people out of 

3413
02:43:47,161 --> 02:43:49,531
restaurants.
How about we all realized that if we're 

3414
02:43:49,531 --> 02:43:52,351
going to treat each other as Americans,
we're going to agree that we're on this 

3415
02:43:52,351 --> 02:43:52,810
team.
We got to start acting like teammates.

3416
02:43:52,840 --> 02:43:53,890
That's it.
Yeah,

3417
02:43:54,080 --> 02:43:55,660
so you don't like what the coach is 
saying.

3418
02:43:55,870 --> 02:44:00,870
Let's let's find common ground instead 
of always searching for the negative in 

3419
02:44:01,361 --> 02:44:06,361
things instead of reinforcing ridiculous
ideas because you know that that's what 

3420
02:44:06,361 --> 02:44:06,460
your team supports.

3421
02:44:06,460 --> 02:44:11,460
Like I see a lot of people online 
talking about this immigrant issue and 

3422
02:44:11,460 --> 02:44:14,880
they either don't have kids or they 
don't think it could happen to their 

3423
02:44:14,880 --> 02:44:14,880
kids.
Their ideas,

3424
02:44:14,880 --> 02:44:15,820
hey,
shouldn't could come over here.

3425
02:44:15,850 --> 02:44:19,150
You get those broke.
The law shouldn't have fucking come over

3426
02:44:19,151 --> 02:44:21,130
here if you didn't want to get your kid 
separated.

3427
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:26,520
If you were in the presence of a woman 
who came over here from Guatemala and 

3428
02:44:27,671 --> 02:44:32,671
she's poor and she's starving and 
they're taking her baby away and she's 

3429
02:44:32,671 --> 02:44:36,841
wailing and screaming from a primal,
primal place in her,

3430
02:44:37,330 --> 02:44:41,080
her DNA that the one thing she loves 
more than anything is being taken away a

3431
02:44:41,081 --> 02:44:42,190
baby.
Yeah.

3432
02:44:42,191 --> 02:44:44,260
If you.
If that doesn't freak you the fuck out,

3433
02:44:44,261 --> 02:44:45,850
you're not a part of the team,
man,

3434
02:44:46,120 --> 02:44:47,650
you're missing it.
You're missing it.

3435
02:44:47,690 --> 02:44:48,820
What's,
what are we here for?

3436
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:50,650
We're here for 100 years of whatever.

3437
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:53,110
That's what we're here for.
If you want to spend 100 years,

3438
02:44:53,111 --> 02:44:55,210
say in Earth,
broke the law,

3439
02:44:55,550 --> 02:44:58,060
I don't want you on the team.
You're an asshole,

3440
02:44:58,240 --> 02:44:59,160
right?
And I'll give you.

3441
02:44:59,330 --> 02:45:01,210
I don't give a fuck if you're right or 
left.

3442
02:45:01,330 --> 02:45:04,120
I don't care if you're religious or I 
don't care if you're an atheist,

3443
02:45:04,180 --> 02:45:07,390
if that's what you support,
you are an asshole and we don't want you

3444
02:45:07,391 --> 02:45:08,950
on our team.
Okay?

3445
02:45:09,010 --> 02:45:14,010
So,
but if you agree with certain economic 

3446
02:45:14,010 --> 02:45:14,590
policies that I don't agree with and we 
could have a discussion about it,

3447
02:45:14,591 --> 02:45:18,940
we could figure out why you agree and we
could figure out why people are allowing

3448
02:45:18,941 --> 02:45:23,941
all of this money to get into politics.
Why are we allowing all these special 

3449
02:45:23,941 --> 02:45:27,781
interest groups and lobbyists to 
interfere with our laws and influence 

3450
02:45:27,781 --> 02:45:27,781
our,
our,

3451
02:45:27,781 --> 02:45:31,921
our politicians,
and create all this shit that we don't 

3452
02:45:31,921 --> 02:45:31,921
want?

3453
02:45:31,921 --> 02:45:32,560
Well,
here's the number one reason.

3454
02:45:32,920 --> 02:45:36,640
You can't just vote online,
you can't just vote one person,

3455
02:45:36,641 --> 02:45:39,160
one vote.
It's the electoral college and there's a

3456
02:45:39,161 --> 02:45:40,600
lot of checks and balances that are in 
place.

3457
02:45:40,601 --> 02:45:45,601
That's all wonderful and groovy,
but it's not giving the trust to the 

3458
02:45:45,601 --> 02:45:45,601
people,
trusted the people that are.

3459
02:45:45,601 --> 02:45:47,110
They're informed that they could make 
their own decisions,

3460
02:45:47,111 --> 02:45:49,390
that more people should be able to make 
the decision,

3461
02:45:49,570 --> 02:45:54,570
but they're happening now that 28 year 
old girl who who a 28 year old debt 

3462
02:45:56,560 --> 02:46:01,560
democratic socialists,
whether I agree with her or not and I 

3463
02:46:01,560 --> 02:46:04,411
don't know if I do or don't.
I bet I agree with her on a lot of 

3464
02:46:04,411 --> 02:46:04,411
things.
I think education should be free.

3465
02:46:04,411 --> 02:46:05,530
I think we should figure out a way.
If we could pay for bombs,

3466
02:46:05,650 --> 02:46:10,650
we could pay for schools.
I think that this idea that everybody 

3467
02:46:10,650 --> 02:46:10,650
should have healthcare.

3468
02:46:10,650 --> 02:46:14,680
It's a great idea.
Who the fuck wants people to not be 

3469
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:17,320
healthy?
Who wants people to be hurt and not be 

3470
02:46:17,320 --> 02:46:17,320
able to fix it?
Who wants to do?

3471
02:46:17,320 --> 02:46:21,280
Are you really saying that struggling 
people should have to pay exorbitant 

3472
02:46:21,280 --> 02:46:25,121
amounts of money to get fixed when we 
could maybe chip in and help members of 

3473
02:46:25,121 --> 02:46:25,121
our team,
that stupid paper,

3474
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:27,630
fill it out,
figure it out yourself on how to.

3475
02:46:27,770 --> 02:46:29,450
You got lucky bitch.
You got lucky.

3476
02:46:29,451 --> 02:46:31,250
You don't have leukemia.
You didn't break both your legs.

3477
02:46:31,251 --> 02:46:32,840
When you're 18,
your parents are dead.

3478
02:46:33,010 --> 02:46:34,890
You got lucky piece of shit.
Yeah.

3479
02:46:34,950 --> 02:46:39,950
These are people on our team is.
I'm not talking about people who are 

3480
02:46:39,950 --> 02:46:39,950
lazy,
good for nothing.

3481
02:46:39,950 --> 02:46:42,470
Losers mooching off the system.
You're going to have that too.

3482
02:46:42,590 --> 02:46:45,650
Where we got to figure out how to 
educate people so that that happens less

3483
02:46:45,651 --> 02:46:46,130
and less.

3484
02:46:46,220 --> 02:46:47,360
That's what we got to figure out how to 
do.

3485
02:46:47,390 --> 02:46:50,840
That's it you just described.
I mean that is it.

3486
02:46:50,841 --> 02:46:53,390
I don't know what to call that thing you
just talked about,

3487
02:46:53,660 --> 02:46:58,660
but like that's happening everywhere.
That's not just happening in the United 

3488
02:46:58,660 --> 02:47:00,110
States.
That's a global shift that's happening.

3489
02:47:00,320 --> 02:47:02,180
Have you.
Did you see the video when she found out

3490
02:47:02,181 --> 02:47:07,181
she won this amazing put play it.
It's like one of the rear realist 

3491
02:47:07,181 --> 02:47:08,450
moments and look,
people are angry.

3492
02:47:08,480 --> 02:47:13,480
Twenty eight year olds.
What the fuck does she know what she 

3493
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:13,480
doesn't know?
She'll learn 20,

3494
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:13,480
like,
yeah,

3495
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:14,810
that's fine.
Let's find out what she learns.

3496
02:47:14,811 --> 02:47:19,811
Maybe she maybe she knows a lot.
I liked the fact she wasn't supposed to 

3497
02:47:19,811 --> 02:47:24,341
win.
I like the fact that the guy who was an 

3498
02:47:24,341 --> 02:47:26,051
incumbent was a 10 term and come back 
and that he spent 10 to one verse on 

3499
02:47:26,811 --> 02:47:31,811
her.
Then how much money she spent 10 to one 

3500
02:47:31,811 --> 02:47:32,830
in grassroots grassroots elected man.
And that's how this.

3501
02:47:32,870 --> 02:47:34,970
That's it.
That can happen too.

3502
02:47:34,971 --> 02:47:36,060
She's a kid.
Yeah,

3503
02:47:36,450 --> 02:47:38,600
she's pretty.
She's a pretty young,

3504
02:47:38,630 --> 02:47:40,160
28 year old.
I mean watch this,

3505
02:47:40,161 --> 02:47:41,390
watch this shit.
When she wins,

3506
02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:42,470
plays it.

3507
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:50,470
How are you feeling?
Can you put it into words?

3508
02:47:55,280 --> 02:47:57,810
You know,
I don't know if Democratic craddick

3509
02:47:57,810 --> 02:48:02,810
socialism is the answer,
but I know it's a part of the 

3510
02:48:02,810 --> 02:48:02,810
conversation.
Yep.

3511
02:48:02,810 --> 02:48:06,510
And this is the thing that locking out 
any ideology in this team as part of the

3512
02:48:06,511 --> 02:48:11,511
conversation,
like what is democratic socialism 

3513
02:48:11,511 --> 02:48:11,511
entail?
Like what does it entail?

3514
02:48:11,511 --> 02:48:11,511
I'm,
I don't.

3515
02:48:11,511 --> 02:48:13,650
I don't buy all this.
The market will take care.

3516
02:48:13,651 --> 02:48:15,150
It's care of itself.
Bullshit.

3517
02:48:15,390 --> 02:48:20,390
I think there's a certain amount of us 
we have to chip in to the community 

3518
02:48:20,390 --> 02:48:20,390
pile.
Yeah,

3519
02:48:20,390 --> 02:48:20,390
Shit.
That's real.

3520
02:48:20,570 --> 02:48:24,840
The real problem is how efficient and 
good is the community pile or the.

3521
02:48:24,841 --> 02:48:26,930
A bunch of lazy constantly community 
pile are there.

3522
02:48:27,210 --> 02:48:32,210
Is there waste to nonsense and bullshit?
These people that have those jobs you 

3523
02:48:32,210 --> 02:48:33,000
were talking about earlier that told 
slow down,

3524
02:48:33,001 --> 02:48:35,310
slow down.
I know you could do this in two hours,

3525
02:48:35,311 --> 02:48:36,960
but you can get an eight hour day out of
this.

3526
02:48:37,350 --> 02:48:38,310
Don't fuck this up.

3527
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:40,600
How much of that's going on?
I don't want any of that going right?

3528
02:48:40,950 --> 02:48:44,830
But if the community pile is taking care
of it and,

3529
02:48:44,831 --> 02:48:46,740
and managed in a,
in a,

3530
02:48:47,230 --> 02:48:52,230
uh,
an honest and a way that's trustworthy 

3531
02:48:52,501 --> 02:48:56,360
and great for all involved and 
beneficial to the community and,

3532
02:48:56,740 --> 02:49:01,740
and supportive of community values and 
love and this idea that we're all on a 

3533
02:49:01,740 --> 02:49:02,640
team and that you're going to be okay.
Did you break your leg,

3534
02:49:02,641 --> 02:49:03,090
Duncan?
Hey,

3535
02:49:03,091 --> 02:49:05,900
you're going to be okay and we make fun 
of Canada's healthcare.

3536
02:49:05,910 --> 02:49:07,710
And it's not the best,
it's the best.

3537
02:49:07,800 --> 02:49:09,420
I have friends,
my friend Jen,

3538
02:49:09,421 --> 02:49:12,470
she broke her fucking knee.
She had to get a acl reconstruction.

3539
02:49:12,480 --> 02:49:14,970
They kind of botched it and they had to 
go back in and fix it again.

3540
02:49:15,120 --> 02:49:16,770
She had to wait forever.
It's not the best,

3541
02:49:17,130 --> 02:49:22,130
but it's there.
It's something and it maybe that can be 

3542
02:49:22,130 --> 02:49:22,130
improved.

3543
02:49:22,130 --> 02:49:22,410
I may be improving.
That is better.

3544
02:49:22,470 --> 02:49:24,210
Let me throw this in.
So have options.

3545
02:49:24,240 --> 02:49:27,390
But I also believe in options for people
to do it better.

3546
02:49:27,450 --> 02:49:29,280
Like the surgeons that you can get in 
the United States.

3547
02:49:29,281 --> 02:49:32,400
Like there's a guy Dr Getelman to go fix
my knee.

3548
02:49:32,580 --> 02:49:35,330
He's a fucking wizard.
This guy's really got good.

3549
02:49:35,331 --> 02:49:40,331
He does a lot of pro athletes.
I mean he did a great fucking job 

3550
02:49:40,331 --> 02:49:40,380
reconstructing my knee.
He's an artist.

3551
02:49:40,680 --> 02:49:45,680
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with someone like that getting paid 

3552
02:49:45,680 --> 02:49:45,680
more.
I don't think if someone was like,

3553
02:49:45,680 --> 02:49:48,930
I think Lebron James should get paid 
more for playing basketball than me.

3554
02:49:49,170 --> 02:49:50,690
If I was playing basketball,
I shouldn't.

3555
02:49:50,700 --> 02:49:53,220
You pay as much as she's fucking way 
better.

3556
02:49:53,250 --> 02:49:53,730
Right?
Yeah.

3557
02:49:53,731 --> 02:49:56,880
And I think that there's,
there's that with doctors as well,

3558
02:49:56,881 --> 02:50:00,270
I think with everything as well,
but I think that it's a lot like there's

3559
02:50:00,271 --> 02:50:01,870
a lot of people that are,
um,

3560
02:50:01,930 --> 02:50:05,490
a state funded prosecutors or,
or a defense attorneys,

3561
02:50:05,750 --> 02:50:06,210
you know,
where,

3562
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:07,740
where the people can't afford it.

3563
02:50:08,110 --> 02:50:08,720
Uh,
you know,

3564
02:50:08,730 --> 02:50:09,660
you get,
what is that called?

3565
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:13,320
What's the offender?
Public public defender,

3566
02:50:13,321 --> 02:50:18,321
yeah.
There's a lot of people that are really 

3567
02:50:18,321 --> 02:50:18,321
good,
really good,

3568
02:50:18,321 --> 02:50:18,321
really young,
hungry,

3569
02:50:18,321 --> 02:50:18,670
very good at it.
They just,

3570
02:50:18,740 --> 02:50:23,740
they're,
they're going to put in their time in 

3571
02:50:23,740 --> 02:50:23,740
the public sector or doing it for,
for the public public defender.

3572
02:50:23,820 --> 02:50:26,760
And then they eventually go onto maybe,
maybe even not do that.

3573
02:50:26,761 --> 02:50:31,761
Maybe they just did.
They get satisfaction out of helping 

3574
02:50:31,761 --> 02:50:34,131
people that don't have any money.
That doesn't mean that you shouldn't 

3575
02:50:34,131 --> 02:50:36,231
have high priced lawyers as well.
And it doesn't mean that people 

3576
02:50:36,231 --> 02:50:39,441
shouldn't be able to pursue excellence 
and be rewarded for that excellence and 

3577
02:50:39,441 --> 02:50:40,650
be able to do whatever the fuck they 
want with it.

3578
02:50:40,890 --> 02:50:45,890
Whether they want to be charitable with 
that money or where they want to be 

3579
02:50:45,890 --> 02:50:48,411
selfish with that money.
If they're pursuing excellence and 

3580
02:50:48,411 --> 02:50:48,890
through their excellence they did.

3581
02:50:49,050 --> 02:50:53,030
They managed to amass an extreme amount 
of wealth doing playing the guitar,

3582
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:55,410
whatever the fuck they do.
There's nothing wrong with that either.

3583
02:50:55,510 --> 02:50:57,360
We've got to stop thinking there's 
something wrong with that,

3584
02:50:57,570 --> 02:51:01,620
but chipping in and everybody putting 
into the company,

3585
02:51:01,621 --> 02:51:04,800
pop is in a sense some form of 
socialism,

3586
02:51:04,801 --> 02:51:09,801
right?
Like we agree on some kind of socialism 

3587
02:51:09,801 --> 02:51:11,430
like is when you consider like the fire 
department,

3588
02:51:11,580 --> 02:51:14,460
the police department.
It's just like social things,

3589
02:51:14,461 --> 02:51:15,630
right?
We put money into it.

3590
02:51:15,631 --> 02:51:20,631
It's not a total redistribution of 
wealth like deciding how much rich 

3591
02:51:20,631 --> 02:51:22,200
people should pay,
but it is deciding you got to chip in.

3592
02:51:22,500 --> 02:51:24,420
We all got to chip in.
Everybody's got a chip.

3593
02:51:24,690 --> 02:51:26,880
I just don't feel like the chip and in 
is good.

3594
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:32,000
We feel like it's all fucked up.
We feel like there's a bunch of dummies 

3595
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:32,000
out there like this jeff sessions guy.

3596
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:35,970
That guy gets paid for my chip.
This fucking dummy and all these fucking

3597
02:51:35,971 --> 02:51:40,971
people that are robbing the system with 
their two hour a day jobs that they're 

3598
02:51:40,971 --> 02:51:43,350
stretching out to eight hours.
That builds resentment.

3599
02:51:43,830 --> 02:51:48,830
It's poor management and it's also 
people that are listless and they have 

3600
02:51:48,830 --> 02:51:50,280
these.
They're not valuable jobs and not like a

3601
02:51:50,281 --> 02:51:55,281
job that commands the same sort of 
attention is like some of the more 

3602
02:51:55,410 --> 02:51:57,750
attractive jobs that people seek out.
Yeah,

3603
02:51:57,751 --> 02:51:58,620
man,
I,

3604
02:51:58,621 --> 02:52:00,360
I.
it's all of it's true.

3605
02:52:00,630 --> 02:52:04,980
I just think it's,
it's the what people think is let's wait

3606
02:52:04,990 --> 02:52:06,370
for the government to do this

3607
02:52:07,080 --> 02:52:09,730
and that's where I think the problem is 
like instead of thinking like,

3608
02:52:09,731 --> 02:52:10,390
okay,
yeah,

3609
02:52:10,391 --> 02:52:15,391
all that's true.
Let's like figure out a way to get more 

3610
02:52:15,391 --> 02:52:17,980
taxpayer money out of the military 
industrial complex out of the prisons.

3611
02:52:18,250 --> 02:52:23,250
It,
let's put it in the neighborhoods that 

3612
02:52:23,250 --> 02:52:23,290
need it.
Let's get it for funding education,

3613
02:52:23,500 --> 02:52:28,500
all of that is really beautiful,
but when it's still in and you want to 

3614
02:52:29,321 --> 02:52:32,290
vote and make all that happen,
grassroots movements,

3615
02:52:32,320 --> 02:52:37,320
all of it,
but also think of the term socialism,

3616
02:52:37,420 --> 02:52:38,980
right?
Just what is it?

3617
02:52:39,190 --> 02:52:41,950
Social.
It's like you don't have to wait for the

3618
02:52:41,951 --> 02:52:46,951
state to come and start figuring out 
ways to tax people to make that pile of 

3619
02:52:47,621 --> 02:52:49,930
money happened.
Like this is.

3620
02:52:49,960 --> 02:52:54,550
This is where I think it's an 
interesting thing to start exploring the

3621
02:52:54,551 --> 02:52:59,551
idea of intentional communities.
I'm not saying starting a commune or 

3622
02:52:59,551 --> 02:53:03,091
anything like that,
but you can actually push your 

3623
02:53:03,091 --> 02:53:04,300
friendship group to the next level.

3624
02:53:04,300 --> 02:53:07,900
Like it doesn't just have to be a random
group of friends who knows each other.

3625
02:53:08,140 --> 02:53:13,140
Like you can start that pile of opulence
with a group of friends where it's like,

3626
02:53:13,420 --> 02:53:18,420
you know what I mean?
A group of friends can just agree with 

3627
02:53:18,420 --> 02:53:18,420
each other like,
hey man,

3628
02:53:18,420 --> 02:53:20,560
just so you know,
you're not going to be homeless.

3629
02:53:20,980 --> 02:53:25,980
I got you.
I'm not going to fucking give you money 

3630
02:53:25,980 --> 02:53:26,020
all the Goddamn time.
And if you like,

3631
02:53:26,290 --> 02:53:27,520
you know,
if you're like,

3632
02:53:28,660 --> 02:53:31,780
you don't even have to say any of this 
shit except hey,

3633
02:53:32,020 --> 02:53:33,670
we're.
This is always okay.

3634
02:53:33,690 --> 02:53:34,840
You're okay.
You're okay.

3635
02:53:34,970 --> 02:53:36,260
Gotcha.
Right.

3636
02:53:36,570 --> 02:53:39,720
That's what you and I did when you moved
in with Joe.

3637
02:53:40,480 --> 02:53:43,060
I know man,
and I forget about that sometimes.

3638
02:53:43,210 --> 02:53:45,790
We lived together for like six months.
I don't forget about it.

3639
02:53:45,980 --> 02:53:46,470
And,
and,

3640
02:53:46,480 --> 02:53:47,500
and the,
the,

3641
02:53:47,560 --> 02:53:48,280
the,
um,

3642
02:53:48,550 --> 02:53:53,550
that kind of thing,
which is what I'm saying is like 

3643
02:53:53,550 --> 02:53:54,940
everyone right now and,
and I understand why I'm in,

3644
02:53:54,970 --> 02:53:59,970
but to me there seems to be something 
demonic about the public fixation on the

3645
02:54:00,251 --> 02:54:02,260
state.
It's the state.

3646
02:54:02,261 --> 02:54:05,800
Is this like dragon and it's like got 
like,

3647
02:54:05,860 --> 02:54:06,820
it's a.
well,

3648
02:54:07,030 --> 02:54:09,010
I think it's a daddy.
It's a daddy.

3649
02:54:09,140 --> 02:54:13,210
It's a multi-arm daddy with a bunch of 
fucking laser pointers that it's got the

3650
02:54:13,211 --> 02:54:16,960
entire population watching like cats 
running around.

3651
02:54:16,961 --> 02:54:18,050
Right,
right.

3652
02:54:19,160 --> 02:54:20,060
God,
they did that.

3653
02:54:20,061 --> 02:54:21,340
Oh my God,
he did that.

3654
02:54:21,341 --> 02:54:22,640
Oh my God,
they did that.

3655
02:54:22,700 --> 02:54:24,920
When will this change?
When will this change

3656
02:54:25,020 --> 02:54:29,040
your phone's ringing gas.
Who's fucking calling your dad?

3657
02:54:29,250 --> 02:54:31,170
When was the last time you talked to 
your dad?

3658
02:54:31,230 --> 02:54:36,230
Three months ago.
Call Your fucking dad back the whole 

3659
02:54:36,230 --> 02:54:36,520
time you were like,

3660
02:54:36,590 --> 02:54:37,210
God,
yeah.

3661
02:54:37,230 --> 02:54:38,750
Did Dr Dre

3662
02:54:38,920 --> 02:54:40,750
the whole time you're neglecting your 
family.

3663
02:54:40,990 --> 02:54:45,990
You're neglecting your neighborhood.
You're walking down the street looking 

3664
02:54:45,990 --> 02:54:46,630
at your phone like,
holy fuck.

3665
02:54:46,780 --> 02:54:48,550
He said that.
Oh,

3666
02:54:48,580 --> 02:54:51,880
I'm writing a fucking blog about that.
Guess what,

3667
02:54:51,881 --> 02:54:56,881
you're walking by dude,
you're walking by fucking plastic 

3668
02:54:56,881 --> 02:54:57,160
bottles,
piles of fucking trash,

3669
02:54:57,370 --> 02:55:02,370
three fucking mathematics in some 
fucking woman who just got beaten by her

3670
02:55:02,651 --> 02:55:04,310
husband is now living on the streets

3671
02:55:04,310 --> 02:55:08,390
for the last couple of weeks and you've 
got fucking $40,000

3672
02:55:08,391 --> 02:55:10,460
in the bank account.
Liquid.

3673
02:55:11,410 --> 02:55:14,600
And when I say that to the garden you 
can touch.

3674
02:55:14,720 --> 02:55:16,010
Yes,
yes.

3675
02:55:16,011 --> 02:55:21,011
Tend to the garden.
You can touch and do it in an organized 

3676
02:55:21,011 --> 02:55:21,530
way and then like maybe a,
but don't you have a garden that you can

3677
02:55:21,531 --> 02:55:23,660
touch this giant or you think about 
that.

3678
02:55:23,900 --> 02:55:28,900
Think about what you've done during this
podcast and some of the things that 

3679
02:55:28,900 --> 02:55:32,531
you've said.
You basically touched an enormous 

3680
02:55:32,531 --> 02:55:32,531
garden.
Sure.

3681
02:55:32,531 --> 02:55:32,531
That,
that's,

3682
02:55:32,531 --> 02:55:33,500
that's,
that's one.

3683
02:55:33,530 --> 02:55:37,460
That's a really easy way to do it 
because I'm a Yappy motherfucker.

3684
02:55:37,670 --> 02:55:40,220
I'm talking about like,
no in your life too,

3685
02:55:40,250 --> 02:55:42,680
but that counts too.
I think it does count,

3686
02:55:42,890 --> 02:55:47,890
but I think that it's,
it would be easy to do things like that 

3687
02:55:47,890 --> 02:55:47,890
and,
and,

3688
02:55:47,890 --> 02:55:50,240
and still forget about something that's 
really basic,

3689
02:55:50,241 --> 02:55:52,100
which is now that I'm talking about that
shit,

3690
02:55:52,130 --> 02:55:57,130
I'm thinking to myself right now,
like in my neighborhood,

3691
02:55:58,041 --> 02:55:59,300
I'm thinking like,
wait a minute,

3692
02:55:59,301 --> 02:56:01,220
wait,
what am I not doing?

3693
02:56:01,250 --> 02:56:06,250
I don't know what it is yet,
but I guarantee you there's something 

3694
02:56:06,250 --> 02:56:06,250
that I could do.
And,

3695
02:56:06,250 --> 02:56:10,340
and I liked that man because he knew 
like tithing to the church.

3696
02:56:10,370 --> 02:56:13,580
Yes.
So to me that I think we may have talked

3697
02:56:13,581 --> 02:56:18,581
about this before but I get it and all 
but like it always seemed like a really 

3698
02:56:19,850 --> 02:56:23,300
boring way to do it.
Like the plate comes by,

3699
02:56:23,301 --> 02:56:27,680
you throw some money and you don't.
It goes to church stuff you don't know.

3700
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:32,060
But the idea of tithing,
I think there's something to it which is

3701
02:56:32,061 --> 02:56:35,210
like if you just kind of look at your 
income and you think,

3702
02:56:35,211 --> 02:56:40,211
all right,
five percent of this shit is gonna get 

3703
02:56:40,211 --> 02:56:41,450
spent or 10 percent or whatever you're 
comfortable with.

3704
02:56:41,840 --> 02:56:46,840
I'm putting that in a pile and that pile
is going to helping people in my 

3705
02:56:47,211 --> 02:56:51,920
neighborhood or my friends or my family 
and I'm just going to give that away.

3706
02:56:52,340 --> 02:56:55,460
And um,
I think there's something to be said for

3707
02:56:55,461 --> 02:57:00,461
that because right now I think we were a
little too fixated on the daddy state 

3708
02:57:00,900 --> 02:57:05,900
helping us and I think it's more 
important that we start helping each 

3709
02:57:05,900 --> 02:57:09,221
other and forming communities with that 
are based on love and friendship and 

3710
02:57:09,261 --> 02:57:14,261
just figure it out.
Some of the communities are going to 

3711
02:57:14,261 --> 02:57:16,030
fail,
some of them are going to get a couple 

3712
02:57:16,030 --> 02:57:16,030
of assholes in there who are con artists
and trick.

3713
02:57:16,030 --> 02:57:18,290
Everybody are lazy people.
But the main thing is,

3714
02:57:18,291 --> 02:57:23,291
is like let's start thinking in terms of
organizing into communities that aren't 

3715
02:57:23,660 --> 02:57:27,680
based on a fixation on the government 
right now.

3716
02:57:27,710 --> 02:57:30,860
And then let's see what happens.
And with that,

3717
02:57:30,920 --> 02:57:35,920
ladies and gentlemen,
we conclude another episode of the Joe 

3718
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:36,460
Rogan experience.
I'd like to thank my guests,

love for everybody.

3723

We doing it.
We're doing this.

We're going to be okay.
Bye.
