1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,510
Brian,
this doesn't have a connection.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,040
Did you plug it in?

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,130
Oh,
okay.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,790
Hold on.
Hold on.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,670
When your wife was

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,780
Wifi is jacked,
people are asking why do you guys have 

7
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:38,170
an opening song?
And then after the opening song then you

8
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,810
play more music.
What kind of Shit is that?

9
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,990
And you're right.
It's fucking ridiculous.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,350
So shows you take us.
I can't believe anybody's even listening

11
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,260
to this point.
This is the most ghetto podcast on the 

12
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:56,320
internet.
The most fun to do though.

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,130
And this is a Mashup Brian,
who's the Mesh out?

14
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,940
I believe it's party Ben.
It might be girl talk.

15
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:04,650
I don't know.
You know what man?

16
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:09,651
I used to not be a big fan of podcasts 
until I heard this Voodoo child z mix 

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,330
and I was like God damn.
Okay.

18
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:15,720
You did something there.
You know like a lot of times I'll listen

19
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:18,300
to podcasts and one or to a mashup 
rather.

20
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,550
And I'm like this isn't that 
interesting.

21
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:23,760
It's kind of that every now and then 
they didn't fucking make something super

22
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,150
cool.

23
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,500
Just kill it.
Yeah.

24
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:30,501
It's like,
should they shouldn't think would go 

25
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:30,501
together like chicken and Waffles,
Bam.

26
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:30,501
Yeah.
Yeah.

27
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:33,450
You know there is a Jay z Lincoln Park 
Mashup that was just dirty.

28
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,510
Yeah.
It didn't feel like a whole album of 

29
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,510
that.
Yeah.

30
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,201
I love when Shit like that happens.
I love when artists get together like 

31
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:45,381
that and create something fucking nutty.
We were talking about this before the 

32
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:45,381
podcast and it's,
you know,

33
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:46,440
total retard,
hippy talk.

34
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:50,130
But what the fuck is music and why?
What does it do?

35
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Why does it just get in man?
Because way we're talking to is going to

36
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,360
introduce him eventually.
This is my friend Chris.

37
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,180
What's going on?
Chris is a,

38
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,480
he's a writer.
He writes for the blog.

39
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:04,200
What is it?
Warrior.

40
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:07,700
Poet Dot taught us to us then and what 
is it.us,

41
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,710
man.
I'm looking to take over the world 

42
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:12,710
eventually,
but I'm starting with the US.

43
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:12,890
[inaudible]

44
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,750
dot com is currently unavailable.
So yeah,

45
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:18,450
I couldn't get Joe Rogan.com.
The dude who owns it as,

46
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:20,190
as he's a nice guy.
He's a real estate guy,

47
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:21,420
but he,
he goes,

48
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:23,460
just occurred to me to more famous.
You get the more.

49
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:25,080
This is worth it.
I was like,

50
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,740
oh,
all right.

51
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,770
Derek,
come up buying the twitter dude who was 

52
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:30,770
holding down your a?
Yeah,

53
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,590
but I got it back from twitter.
Twitter gave it up,

54
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:33,810
but this dude's his name's Joe Rogan and
he's older than me.

55
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:36,330
So respect to him.
It's got to go to him more than it is to

56
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:37,310
me.
Uh,

57
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,370
you know,
and I was willing to buy it.

58
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,750
But when after you said that,
it was like,

59
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,940
get out of here,
the more famous you get,

60
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:43,830
the more initiative worth.
Come on,

61
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,160
man.
What,

62
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:46,620
what are you 12?
Just tell me what you want.

63
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,650
Can we talk through this?
More family feel that I can hold onto 

64
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:51,650
it.
You feel grit and restaurant,

65
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,600
except you have to be able to buy it for
it to be valuable in some matter.

66
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:57,360
You can find me now.
It's Google Joe Rogan.net.

67
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,800
If you can't,
it's probably good.

68
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,850
It probably filters out a bunch of 
idiots.

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,890
Yeah.
Because if you can't type.net

70
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,040
instead of.com,
she'd give up that quick.

71
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,790
You know,
I couldn't find it.

72
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,670
I don't want you find the people who put
the.com

73
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:12,130
in the google search bar instead of the 
url to.

74
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,350
Yeah,
sure.

75
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,520
Brian knows about that.
I do that all the time.

76
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,020
What happens when that,
when you do that,

77
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,430
you porn shows up in the aftermath using
a flashlight.

78
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,730
Is that really what happens?
Porn shows up if you put a dollar every 

79
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,360
time I put anything I,
I'm on fucking directly.

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,480
I think.
I think that's called a virus or I just 

81
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,740
need to clear my cache because it 
seriously,

82
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:37,840
everything that comes up on my toolbar 
know,

83
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,080
just been beaten it furiously lately.
Brian,

84
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:42,430
if you don't know,
ladies and gentlemen,

85
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:47,431
Brian had a very lust filled short term 
relationship which filled with passion 

86
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:51,100
and the loss of fluids.
And then,

87
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,520
uh,
as,

88
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,970
as quickly as the storm came into town,
storm left and I have kids.

89
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:59,971
Now I have a kid.
Now he's got a kid from the 

90
00:03:59,971 --> 00:03:59,971
relationship.
Just.

91
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:00,880
So here's,
here's lesson number one.

92
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:05,881
Children.
Anyone under 30 that I'm talking to you 

93
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:05,881
right now,
listen to me.

94
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:09,190
Do not get a dog with a chick ever.
Don't do it unless you guys have kids.

95
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't get a dog and if you do,
do it good.

96
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,070
Get nutty.
And if you do,

97
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:13,450
do it,
go right to the pet store.

98
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,450
Fuck what they say.
Just go against all the rules and 

99
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:18,510
getting one of those dogs that will go 
to the pet.

100
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,260
So don't support puppy mills,
man.

101
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:25,261
Hope those pet stores go under.
Go to the fucking pound or go to a good 

102
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:25,990
breeder.
I got one of my dogs from a breeder,

103
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:26,590
man,
I am not,

104
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,260
there's nothing wrong with breeders.
People talk shit about breeders,

105
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:34,261
but if the guy's a passionate breeder 
and really breeds dogs because he wants 

106
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:35,320
like a good beat.
My dog is awesome dude.

107
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:37,540
And one of the reasons why he's awesome 
is because his dad was awesome.

108
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,970
His Dad was one of the security dogs on 
fear factor.

109
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,600
We had um,
like bite people in these big crazy 

110
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:45,600
bites,
suits and his dad whose dog was so cool.

111
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,560
He was just chill,
hanging out with everybody.

112
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:52,561
Not Do she do the other dogs,
it was just the sweetest dog come over 

113
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:52,561
to hey man,
what's going on?

114
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:54,790
Meanwhile he's this giant,
massive and I'm like,

115
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:59,791
what a great dog.
Like he's so friendly and such a 

116
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,250
difference.
Genuinely affectionate,

117
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:03,130
like come up and rub against you and 
love it when you rub his head.

118
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,310
Like how crazy is his dogs get like this
perfect personality with this guy.

119
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,700
Won't let his douchebags breed you.
Just anytime he goes,

120
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:10,840
I love them,
I take care of them,

121
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,280
but no breeding you,
you fuck.

122
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,950
And he takes and he takes all the Douche
bags out.

123
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:16,890
So he's done this for like 20 
generations.

124
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:20,020
So his dogs are like the coolest dogs.
Like I come over his house,

125
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,050
he's got these big fucking massive.
So it's like the chicks,

126
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:26,440
like a buck 30 and the males like a buck
50 and they'd come up to me like,

127
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:27,520
okay,
these are lions.

128
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,810
These are digitally small lions that I'm
just assuming you have control over.

129
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,930
You know,
I'm walking in your house and I'm 

130
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,720
trusting my balls and my legs.
I'm trusting all my soft tissue to these

131
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:39,460
monsters that you have under your 
control.

132
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,220
The dogs couldn't have been more chill.
Just like,

133
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:43,240
hey,
how you doing?

134
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,070
Come not,
not like checking you out.

135
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:47,830
Like what's up bitch?
She put the fuck you doing around here,

136
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,600
not sniffing you.
All Aggro.

137
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,430
Like some of them will disrespect you 
with a sniff and that's,

138
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,670
that's like letting you know pitch.
I'm just going to Sniffy Dick Right now.

139
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,590
It's just like Dick,
you know,

140
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,280
they're,
they're going agora one,

141
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:00,080
your man,
they're pulling some Alpha male shit.

142
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,300
You've got to step in and stop them from
doing that.

143
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,040
These dogs were nothing like that,
man.

144
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,070
These dogs were so cool.
They just had this air about them.

145
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:07,640
Like,
hi,

146
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:08,570
hi.
Come on.

147
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:10,550
In.
Meanwhile they would do bite work,

148
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:15,551
like he would have these dudes in a suit
and they would hold them back and they 

149
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:15,890
let the dog loose and it was like a meat
cannon.

150
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,070
Like you shot a side of beef of this 
dude's arm that they would just latch 

151
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,860
onto the guy and bring him down.
I'm like,

152
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:26,861
what a crazy thing.
You've engineered this dog that will 

153
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:30,371
respond to your.
Every command is super intelligent and 

154
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:32,750
is gigantic and can mimic the primal 
attack map and then shut it off and shut

155
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:37,751
it right off the superfund to physically
exactly what he's designed to do and do 

156
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,210
that.
Impressed the.

157
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,240
That was the most impressive thing to me
when we're on fear factors,

158
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,020
what people have done with dog breeding 
and dog training,

159
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,960
like dogs that really know their shit.
They're impressive man.

160
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:50,510
That's impressive.
They have it locked down.

161
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,780
They're giving them treats and they're 
setting them up and they'd given them 

162
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:55,960
their affection or given them the 
recognition for what they'd done.

163
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,350
These dogs will do anything.
They'll do whatever the fuck you say.

164
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,470
No,
that's pretty nuts that we figured out a

165
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:01,260
way to do that.
Yeah.

166
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,650
I always think it's kind of funny that 
people will.

167
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,990
You know,
I totally love and respect people,

168
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:10,991
rescuing animals.
I think that's a beautiful thing that 

169
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:12,971
people do and then there's the other 
people who will buy like a budget 

170
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:17,141
animal,
which is definitely coming from a bad 

171
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:17,141
place for like 100 bucks.

172
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,190
Sometimes people do the dog and the dog.
Yeah,

173
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,170
but you know,
they expect great results.

174
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:27,740
It's like there's a place where they had
like $25 tattoos.

175
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,810
You're going to have this for a long 
time,

176
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:33,680
like make a good investment.
But some people just say it's a dog.

177
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:35,000
What could be wrong with it?
I've had,

178
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,460
I've had a bunch of dogs with like I had
this bulldog.

179
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,550
He's had to have a bunch of operations.
Brian just killed my mind.

180
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,270
Sorry.
He's got a.

181
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,940
he's got a hip dysplasia so he had to 
get both his arms operated and there was

182
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:49,790
like six grand man.
It was serious money.

183
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,250
So it was like $18,000
I think for both of his arms.

184
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:57,251
He had have one operation and then had 
have one like a while later and then 

185
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:59,060
they were talking about replacing his 
back hips and I'm like,

186
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,710
listen,
this dog is lazy as fuck.

187
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:06,070
You don't have to do that.
People dog just likes to chill like you 

188
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,070
don't have to like,
yeah,

189
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,830
he walks around with a bit of a limp,
but he seems happy.

190
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,470
He might be in a little pain,
but most of the time he's just chilling,

191
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,940
you know,
he's not a running dog.

192
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:12,140
He's a bulldog.
He's just gonna.

193
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,220
Relax,
you know,

194
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:13,750
like,
yeah,

195
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,620
he's fucked up.
You don't have to give a metal hips.

196
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,480
All right.
Just let them be fucked up.

197
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,000
But that's a dog that was given to me,
if that,

198
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,040
if that there was a situation as a 
situation,

199
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,290
if they wasn't,
I would have never wanted to get a dog 

200
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:27,290
like that.
I wouldn't want.

201
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,760
I would look for dogs that have a 
genetic propensity for hip dysplasia and

202
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:31,010
stuff like that.
And you gotta you gotta think,

203
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:31,430
man,
it's,

204
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:33,530
it's wonderful to love a dog and take 
care of them.

205
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,830
But you're adopting a giant bag of 
fucking problems with some animals.

206
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,020
You know,
if you get them from a good breeder,

207
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:40,310
you know what the fuck you're getting.
Yeah.

208
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,340
We're uh,
we bought a big savannah cat is going to

209
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:46,400
be almost a 30 pound cat.
Told me about that.

210
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,520
That's insane.
And you feed this thing like chicken 

211
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:51,520
wings and chicken bones and it just,
it,

212
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,520
it just sits there.
And it will stock it and then just 

213
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,030
pounce and then I'll grab it and its 
mouth and throw it up in the air.

214
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,010
And Paul it before it gets down to the 
ground.

215
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,510
Just savage?
Yeah.

216
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,690
Trusted with you.
Does it ever get dickie with you totally

217
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,770
know.
Definitely Alpha mailed it to destroy 

218
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,870
things?
No,

219
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:12,600
he doesn't have that crazy cat instinct 
where he's going to rip it up.

220
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,790
Do you have um,
posts for him or something?

221
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,290
We do have some posts.
And do you use,

222
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,330
does he use those?
Yes,

223
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,540
he does.
So he doesn't defy,

224
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,080
you know,
I get this little motherfucker,

225
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,300
this little motherfucker.
I got this little cat name Oliver and 

226
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,450
he's a ragdoll and he's a sweet cat.
He's super friendly.

227
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:28,220
Super Sweet.
Yeah.

228
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,290
Loves coming up.
But if you tell him to get the fuck out 

229
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:33,290
of here,
he's going to keep coming back.

230
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:33,290
Right.
It's like,

231
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:33,870
you know,
he's going to prove a point.

232
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,110
Like he'll,
he'll come into my library,

233
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:40,470
has a carpet in and I don't like him 
licking his asshole on my white carpet.

234
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,000
You know,
get the fuck out of here at your ass.

235
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,960
Dingleberry's are worse than me.
I'm looking there as well.

236
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,860
Whatever.
Just take care of that right away.

237
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,460
He's trimmed.
I trimmed them,

238
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,760
we turn them for the summer because he's
a fluffy cat and it gets hot as fuck out

239
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:53,970
here.

240
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:54,710
So,
uh,

241
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,680
anyway,
so he,

242
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:00,690
you know,
he's looking at his hands hall and this 

243
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:00,690
white carpet.
I'm like,

244
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:00,690
get the fuck out of here dude.
Come on.

245
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,170
You got to go.
I'm being nice about it.

246
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,330
I pushed.
Pick them up.

247
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:03,420
I take them out.
Thank you.

248
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:04,730
Bye.
I go back in.

249
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,770
I'm rearranging my shit.
I turned back and he's licking his 

250
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:09,770
asshole again.
Same spot.

251
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:09,770
It's like,
what?

252
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,020
You can't lick your asshole over there.
He wanted to walk back to the exact.

253
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:14,580
No,
this is where I want to be.

254
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,510
Like,
no,

255
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,820
I'm the one who decides where I want to 
be.

256
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:19,980
I want to be right here.
I picked him up.

257
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:21,870
I put them out of that room four fucking
times,

258
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,090
but finally shut the door.
I had to shut the door.

259
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,770
I had to give up.
Will Cock sucker.

260
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:27,870
He tests me,
but he's a little tiny cat,

261
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,080
you know,
if it was like a big survival,

262
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,930
that's what they're called.

263
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,490
Yeah.
Well it's bred from service.

264
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,230
So they call them Savannah's when they 
get,

265
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,520
you know,
one generation removed.

266
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,580
So it's a serval mix with a domestic 
serve will mixed with the domestic.

267
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:39,750
But the breeder,
I got them from.

268
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:41,850
They keep,
they've been doing it so long.

269
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:45,060
It's mostly savannah.
Savannah made exactly is a survival.

270
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,360
It's this wild look in mini Cheetah with
really long.

271
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:49,840
So wild animal.
Holy Wild.

272
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,230
They don't train those at all.
No.

273
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,310
Those are,
those are,

274
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,560
those are just gone.
I mean they live.

275
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:57,030
I mean there's pictures from the 
breeder,

276
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,070
the servers with the children and stuff 
like that.

277
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:00,730
Like that.
They hang out.

278
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:03,420
All right.
There was a fear factor show that we did

279
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:06,660
once and it was in this really rural 
area,

280
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,340
really rural,
you know,

281
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:11,370
like these people were like living out.
There was no one out there.

282
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,480
And um,
one woman had a dog that got fucked by a

283
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:18,900
coyote and a hal is half coyote,
half dog puppies.

284
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,990
It was a trip food.
It was a trip,

285
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,680
they were all huddled together because 
it was freezing cold,

286
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,030
bunch of the cast or the crew rather 
took them home as,

287
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,200
as pets because everybody was so 
heartbroken because it was really cold 

288
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,591
outside.
We were filming in the winter and we're 

289
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:36,591
up in like this really,
you know,

290
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:36,750
high altitude area,
it's cold as fuck.

291
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,960
And there's these puppies,
a huddled up together like shaken and 

292
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:41,960
they're half coyote.
Mad.

293
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,140
Crazy dog got fucked by some murder 
beast from the woods.

294
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,110
You know,
when a dog gets fucked by a coyote,

295
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:51,370
that's kind of be some trippy shit.
Got to be an early.

296
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,610
Those hyenas people use those dogs.
You know?

297
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:56,970
I wonder if though,
a wonderful dog fucks coyote if that,

298
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,410
if,
if a coyote fucks a dog because that's 

299
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:02,410
what it is.
Usually.

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:02,410
Probably.
I bet it's on dogs.

301
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,210
Fucking coyote is one of those big.
I bet it's a man or mastiffs could 

302
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:06,490
fucking.
I think you'd kill it.

303
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,650
I think it'd kill it,
but yeah,

304
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,190
I think it would have a war they would 
go to.

305
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,040
It wouldn't,
but a male gets to fuck a dog.

306
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,720
Yeah.
Males can fuck the dogs.

307
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,940
That's so creepy,
man.

308
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:21,050
Yeah.
That's like how wonderful dogs can go 

309
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,521
back to regular dogs after that,
but they just fucked because you ever 

310
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:24,250
seen a coyote.
His mouth,

311
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:25,930
when they open their jaws,
dude,

312
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,930
there's like rows of teeth,
like a crocodile.

313
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:33,931
That shit goes back.
Like the first time I saw a coyote on I 

314
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:33,931
was like,
Whoa,

315
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:38,850
hold on.
Like you start thinking their dogs and 

316
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:38,850
then you see a coyote yard.
You're like,

317
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,540
you've got like 20 extra teeth.
You fuck.

318
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,200
Scary.
Creepy fucking murderers sneaking in and

319
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:45,070
fucking your dog.

320
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,580
There's this dude that runs down lake 
and Austin,

321
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:50,140
which is a big bike,
big jogging trail.

322
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,830
He has three wolves and he just pretends
that they're.

323
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,920
That they're not.
Well,

324
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,070
they're beautiful creatures,
but that's a little.

325
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,430
A little iffy.
Yeah.

326
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,590
I have a friend who has one.
He has one in the fucking thing.

327
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,350
Got Out and killed a gang of goats.
Killed,

328
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,370
like got out of his.
He has like a ranch and it got from his 

329
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,291
ranch and went into the neighbor's ranch
and just started at Jack in their 

330
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:13,291
animals.
Just fuck it up.

331
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:18,070
Everything a little too much.
Blood orgy just went over there that you

332
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:23,071
found a pen that was filled with goats.
So we jumped into this pen and start 

333
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,150
carrying these goats.
A partner.

334
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:26,770
It was a big one,
hundred 6,170

335
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:29,740
pounds just ripping them apart and I'm 
like,

336
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:34,741
Bro,
you don't have control of this fucking 

337
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:34,741
thing man.

338
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:34,741
Like you gotta be careful.
So what does he do?

339
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:36,250
He moves to Hollywood,
brings his wolf.

340
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,180
Three of them,
three of them.

341
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:40,600
This douchebag living in the Hollywood 
hills.

342
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:45,601
This things out killing deer and shit.
I heard wolves aren't even for home 

343
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:47,050
invasion either.
Like if you come in the home,

344
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,520
they're not territorially protected 
because they have those wide range.

345
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:55,521
It's not like other dogs so immersed in 
a burglar murder can come in your home 

346
00:13:55,521 --> 00:13:59,341
and do whatever and then one bolt,
but if it threatens you apparently than 

347
00:13:59,341 --> 00:13:59,670
the willful,
it'll protect you.

348
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,590
It will protect you.
Yeah.

349
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,140
Yeah.
You're his buddy,

350
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,460
but you're not his dad.
Yeah.

351
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,160
Okay.
Yeah.

352
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,510
That's the difference here is buddy.
It's like,

353
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:09,160
you know,
if your roommate is getting attacked,

354
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:14,161
you're going to jump in.
That's not like if your son was getting 

355
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:14,161
attacked,
okay.

356
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:14,320
You know,
or you know,

357
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,880
if your father was getting attacked 
rather,

358
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,170
and that's how dogs are.

359
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,450
Dogs look at you like you're a dad with 
a wolf.

360
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:20,470
He just like,
what's up man?

361
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,230
He's got fucking with.
You will have like,

362
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,700
Yo,
Yo,

363
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,090
Yo,
get that shit outta here.

364
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,940
The Wolf is not like you can't come over
the wolf's.

365
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:28,840
Not like,
who the fuck are you?

366
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:30,280
Let me check you out and make sure 
you're okay.

367
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,420
The Wolf's like,
bitch,

368
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:32,050
I know you.
Okay,

369
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:34,630
what are you going to do to make stupid?
That's how the wolf looks at you.

370
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,630
They will not threatened by you.
And he's like,

371
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:38,920
oh,
are you being nice?

372
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,550
Okay,
good.

373
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:40,690
Whatever.
I got teeth,

374
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:43,240
look at his teeth.
I'll fucking kill you dude.

375
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,830
They're not worried about your last 
mile.

376
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,540
Yeah,
they don't just listen to you.

377
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,260
It's totally different situation.
It's like for the most part,

378
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:52,310
you're probably going to be okay in the 
not going to kill anybody,

379
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,360
but will's of chill.

380
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,360
People will kill people.
There's a woman got attacked by wolves 

381
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,700
recently,
I think it was in Alaska.

382
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:03,701
I'm not sure where it was,
but a woman got attacked and killed by 

383
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:03,701
wolves.
So it's very rare.

384
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,000
And the last time it happened I was like
the 19 fifties or some shit.

385
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:05,950
But.
So what.

386
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,610
So what happened?
You know,

387
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:08,270
if,
if there was,

388
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,760
if there was only like one monster,
uh,

389
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:15,761
you know,
a fucking Goblin ate some Old Lady's 

390
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:15,761
head once in 18,
12.

391
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:17,630
That would be the most haunted woods for
the history of time.

392
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,870
He'd be like,
that thing is real and it's out there 

393
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,870
and we'll wolves are for fucking sure.
Real alright.

394
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,070
They,
how will you could see them.

395
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,030
You can watch documentaries on them.
If you go through Wyoming,

396
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:27,350
you're going to see him.
You know what I'm saying?

397
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:28,250
Or was it Wyoming?

398
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,540
Were werewolves that Wyoming?
Are they North Dakota for sure.

399
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,000
Like yellowstone.
Those are real animals,

400
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,090
man.
And they'll jack you.

401
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,620
And they're smart people.
Forget the mythical basis for that mean 

402
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,060
wolves were real enemies.
I mean the expression keep the wolves in

403
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:44,790
the hills and our women in our beds with
real babies.

404
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,090
You were toasting to that daily,
you know,

405
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:52,150
back in the days when it happened.
Did they just wise up to our hose gun 

406
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,740
situation and just like back off with 
all that shit.

407
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,940
I think they got,
they got trappers just,

408
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,920
you know,
decimated the population.

409
00:15:57,921 --> 00:15:58,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

410
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,440
Is that what it is?
And then the population is so small now.

411
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,270
They don't feel that the strength to 
fuck with people,

412
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,040
right?
Yeah.

413
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,120
They will fuck up your crops or your 
cattle though if you have cows or if you

414
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:10,130
have any animals,
they will fuck them up.

415
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:11,660
Man.
Them and mountain lions.

416
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,680
I was,
I was a kid once and I was reading this 

417
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,700
comic book and it was a.
I used to read a lot of creepy and 

418
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:21,700
eerie.
Do you remember those comic books?

419
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,530
Do you remember those at all?
Creepy and eerie were like these really 

420
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,830
cool comic books that were like black 
and white,

421
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:32,831
like really cool illustrations.
It was all like monster stories and one 

422
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:34,820
of them was about this werewolf that was
a sneaking into these,

423
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:35,270
uh,
God,

424
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,300
these people that sheep and they were 
living in the old west or some shit and 

425
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,930
had sheep and the Werewolf would sneak 
into their pen and kill all the sheep,

426
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,320
you know,
and then the guy goes out there and he 

427
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,320
gets attacked by this werewolf.
And I'm like,

428
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,320
wow.
Crazy.

429
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,831
Would that be if Werewolf was out there 
sneaking people's pens and killing all 

430
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:50,831
the animals?

431
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:50,860
And I thought about it,
Mike.

432
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,200
Just Cheetahs.
Cheetahs do do that.

433
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,260
Mountain lions do do that all the time.
They got a real point.

434
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,290
If you live anywhere near mountain line 
and you have animals in your yard,

435
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,330
you got to read that.
Those are game.

436
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,910
They're going to just hop over that 
fence and kill them and drag them in the

437
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:05,870
woods.
Why is it,

438
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,170
why is a wolf man any scarier than that?
I don't know.

439
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,940
Maybe because it couldn't have sex with 
you.

440
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,600
The wolf man.
It does make the twilight movies,

441
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,750
that's for sure.
Oh yeah,

442
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,330
those guys technically Werewolf.
So you know,

443
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,130
because they just become a wolf,
you know what I'm saying?

444
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:24,080
Then they don't become a werewolf.
They've become a wolf.

445
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,510
Like that's Kinda Gay.
Like you know what I'm saying?

446
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,780
Like if you're going to take the time to
more be something cool and new American 

447
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,590
Werewolf in London type hybrid shit.

448
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,010
Just be a dog team who have killed that 
whole thing now after teen wolf to me 

449
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,010
like,
oh,

450
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,450
it's a werewolf guy.
Wolf.

451
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,970
Kill Them.
Fucking Michael J.

452
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,850
Fox is not scary or that did twilight 
killed a few for vampires.

453
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,630
Vampires are already killed for a time 
ago.

454
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,160
If you think vampires are killed,
go watch Gary Oldman.

455
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:54,690
Do Dracula.
That's what I'm saying though.

456
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:58,780
But then also watched the million other 
TV shows and fucking knockoffs.

457
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,820
Totally.
But if Gary Oldman came out today with 

458
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,661
the New Dracula,
he could rock that shit and you'd be 

459
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:06,661
believing in vampires again.
But now both man,

460
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:07,920
not too much done.
I think he's done.

461
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,620
I think that last one with Venetia del 
Toro that killed it for me.

462
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:12,060
I'm a wolfpack fan,
bro.

463
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:13,930
And I couldn't do it.
Shit.

464
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,040
We've talked about this too many times 
on the podcasts.

465
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,860
I have Wolfman fetishes.
I've some crazy fucking werewolf thing.

466
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:21,090
Man,
I don't know what it is.

467
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,550
Ever since I was a little kid.
Loved Werewolf movies.

468
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,940
Just like the idea that some sketches.
You were drawn werewolves.

469
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,410
Yeah,
yeah,

470
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,220
yeah,
yeah,

471
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,410
yeah,
yeah.

472
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,260
When I was a little kid,
even before high school,

473
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:33,210
a lot of them are like from when I was 
12 and 13,

474
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,710
I'm fucked up.

475
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,780
Tap into something primal and Joe Rogen 
some fucking.

476
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:41,700
Pardon me.
That's why I moved to the woods,

477
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:43,320
man.
There's some part of me that wants to be

478
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:48,321
out with that.
Has Anybody Seen Joe Rogan on a full 

479
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:49,940
moon and why is he tweeting at 6:00
AM?

480
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,950
It's really sad because I can't live in 
the jungle if I could live in the 

481
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,950
jungle.
I live in the jungle,

482
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,760
but there's no jungle in America.
So I choose the woods.

483
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,050
I really would like to be just living 
around animals and shit.

484
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Well,
it's got to represent some primal part 

485
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,080
of all of us.
You know there's something,

486
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,610
there's some energy I think that you 
sound so hippy,

487
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:11,340
faggy bullshit.
So true man.

488
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:16,550
It's like certain energy when you're 
around these animals.

489
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:21,651
Like one of the people that I lived near
up there was this crazy yoga lady,

490
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:25,140
very nice lady,
but crazy yoga lady and I was talking to

491
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,520
her about like mountain lions.

492
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,420
I'm like,
listen,

493
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,780
how do you.
How do you guys deal with the fact 

494
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,151
there's mountain lions?
Because there's a fucking corner store 

495
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:34,151
up there that had a sign that if you get
attacked by a bear,

496
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,720
you should play dead and if you're 
attacked by a mountain lion,

497
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:37,830
you should fight back.
I'm like,

498
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:42,831
what the fuck?
You have strategies to deal with 

499
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:45,740
different monsters jacking you.
You're going to play dead by a bear is 

500
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:45,960
biting the fuck out of you.
Really?

501
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,080
You're really gonna do that.
Are you going to be able to do that?

502
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:50,280
Holy Shit.
So I said,

503
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:55,281
how do you deal with this?
How do you deal with the fact that you 

504
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:55,281
are around these,
these beasts?

505
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:56,570
She goes,
I just let them all in.

506
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,230
When I walked through the woods,
I let them know that I'm here among you.

507
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:05,360
I'm no threat.
I love,

508
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,750
I love you and I love them and I just 
walked through and I've never had a 

509
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:10,750
problem like,
bitch,

510
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,390
you've been so lucky.
Zigged,

511
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:17,490
when you could have zagged,
you could have walked right onto a 

512
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:17,490
mother.
Cougar protected are young.

513
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,740
You could have fucked up and walked into
a fucking grizzly bear and he could have

514
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:24,710
been with its cobs and freaked out and 
decided to eat your face.

515
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,180
You got lucky.

516
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,540
You see all.
You see all those documentaries hang out

517
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,290
with these predators long enough.
Why do people think that they are better

518
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:37,220
than dear?
Why do you think that if there's love in

519
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:39,100
nature,
why does it really?

520
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:44,110
It's all love.
Why does nature let this murderous 

521
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,961
cougar snap this deers fucking neck and 
suck the blood out and then eat its guts

522
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,660
first?
Because that's what they do.

523
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:51,580
They go God's first cause they don't eat
grass.

524
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,850
Then they get their vegetation by eating
the guts of the things that kill,

525
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,360
but it wouldn't happen to you.
Why would it happen to the deer and not 

526
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,400
to you?
Just you really get thanked.

527
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:07,401
The universe gives a fuck if you're 
around a Predator and it wants to eat 

528
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:10,861
and it looks at you and says,
I think I ate one of these back in the 

529
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:10,861
nineties.
I'll try it again.

530
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:11,860
It was good.
Yeah.

531
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,130
I only get a hiker once every 10 years,
but fuck it.

532
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,500
Yeah.
They got that Muesli in their system.

533
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,310
Yeah,
Dude,

534
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,800
they'll jack you.
Especially when they get used to it.

535
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,980
Like that's a the.
There's an area I talked about in my 

536
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,740
act,
an area in India called the cinder bands

537
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,940
and they have a real problem with tigers
there because the congress have gotten 

538
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:31,940
used to eating people.

539
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,240
The tsunamis typhoons rather.
They wash a lot of bodies into the 

540
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,111
river.
A lot of people drowned musical with 

541
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:40,111
fucking villagers.
Man.

542
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:42,130
These people are really poor.
They're living in shacks on the river in

543
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:47,131
India and the Tigers eat the bodies that
drown and so they get a taste of human 

544
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:49,260
flesh and they just started jacking 
people.

545
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,300
Just Jack and people go through the 
article anywhere,

546
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:57,750
Bro.
There's videos on Youtube and look this 

547
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,750
up folks,
if you're,

548
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,210
if you're,
if you're at home or when you get home,

549
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:03,211
you got to check out Sunderbans Tigers 
because there's a bunch of cool 

550
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:04,960
documentaries online and one of them,
these poor fox,

551
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,080
these guys are census takers,
so they have to find out how many of 

552
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,230
these murderous monsters are out there 
in the tall grass,

553
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,530
in the fucking tall grass out on a boat.
So what did this guy,

554
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,560
this guy has a rifle and he's got a 
helmet on.

555
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,890
Okay.
And the helmet has a mask on the back of

556
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:24,670
the head because tigers like to sneak up
behind you and jack you.

557
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,390
They don't want you to see them coming.
They just want a jacket.

558
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,640
So these guys were wearing helmets to 
protect themselves from getting jacked 

559
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,151
by monsters and they have a mask with a 
fucking face on the back of the head 

560
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:37,060
with a tigers.
Figured it out after a while that it was

561
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:42,061
just a face.
So they started jacking guys from the 

562
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:42,061
back.
Anyway,

563
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:42,610
even though they have these face on,
a bunch of dudes in the census,

564
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,580
takers get killed by tigers with fucking
masks on,

565
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,220
so now they're fucked.
These things can swim,

566
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,280
so they have to make sure that the boat 
has an engine so they can swim faster 

567
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,521
than the tiger can.
They can run 50 miles an hour and 

568
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:58,960
they've killed 300,000
people in the last 200 years.

569
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,050
Since then you'd think that someone 
would take up the challenge and be like,

570
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:04,030
all right,
tigers were smarter,

571
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,190
dude.
People are like,

572
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:06,670
you know,
hey,

573
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:09,230
they're a part of nature.
They're part of miniature.

574
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,420
Some regards there,
right?

575
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:12,160
I mean,
what makes us that much better?

576
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,010
Because we have the guns.
This is ridiculous.

577
00:23:15,011 --> 00:23:17,380
We don't need them around.
It's so stupid.

578
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,060
Kill them all.
What are you crazy?

579
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,660
The people in India should be.
We are worried about the extinction of 

580
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:24,660
the Tigers.
You shouldn't be worried.

581
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,900
You should be worried about your fucking
murder.

582
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,420
Murderers master that lives in the 
jungle.

583
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:29,590
Yeah,
you've got to keep it alive.

584
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:31,840
It's your God.
Are you crazy?

585
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,890
Are you fucking that attached to these 
animals that want to kill people?

586
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,090
Good.
Guide them down,

587
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:39,110
man.
Gun the more.

588
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,970
Put human masks on the back of the 
Tigers and really confused everything.

589
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,110
Yeah,
that's what you're gonna do.

590
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,980
But I going to find the tiger and put

591
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,980
a basket on it.
How dare you just suck it up.

592
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,690
Did you try to trick the Tigers that 
we're trying to.

593
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,180
What I'm saying?
Look confused everything,

594
00:23:56,181 --> 00:24:01,181
you know,
there'll be people with tiger maps in 

595
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:01,181
the back of their heads and tigers with 
human mass.

596
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:03,920
If you could transfer human 
consciousness into anything,

597
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:06,200
if you could transfer human 
consciousness into,

598
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:07,510
um,
a,

599
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,130
like an animal just to see what it'd be 
like,

600
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,460
how dope would it be to be able to 
download your fucking brain into a 

601
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,620
tiger's body and just live it?
Move in the,

602
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,250
run it shit.
You're fucking insane.

603
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:28,001
Would that be man?
If you could just control the body of a 

604
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:28,970
tiger with a human mind?
Fuck other tigers.

605
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,720
Damn.
How crazy would that feel?

606
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:36,450
Right?
You know,

607
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,960
oh my God,
fuck this.

608
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,740
This is even when she freaks out,
you got this.

609
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,520
You know,
will allow it to intimidate you even 

610
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:48,590
though it's a tiger and you've got your 
dick inside of her.

611
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,260
You have no fear in full control of this
thing.

612
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,530
Last for 20 seconds,
just loads into her.

613
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,690
Just shoot tiger loads into.
That would be insane,

614
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:03,680
man.
I would think though,

615
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:05,450
if I had to choose,
I would take eagle.

616
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,530
I would like to be an eagle.
That would be the dopest thing ever.

617
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:11,670
Yeah,
because equals get to because jack fish,

618
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,880
bro.
Fucking national animal for a reason.

619
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,080
Have some respect.
You know the Turkey.

620
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
The Turkey was supposed to be our 
national animal.

621
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,390
Really?
Benjamin Franklin was putting forward 

622
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,390
this.
The Turkeys.

623
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,270
Turkeys.
The smartest bird that would have made 

624
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:31,270
us less do see Canada,
they have a maple leaf.

625
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,630
They're all chill up there.
We're going to fucking kill her bird.

626
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,000
We eat once a year.
An Eagle Turkey.

627
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,560
If,
if we didn't have the eagle,

628
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:49,310
maybe we wouldn't be so douchey because 
the ego is such a douchey animal.

629
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,080
Just like,
bitch,

630
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,670
why would you want an eagle?
First of all?

631
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:55,010
Because Eagles don't give a fuck about 
anybody.

632
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,950
You ever looked into an eagles eyes.
That's like the pits of hell.

633
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,520
They don't give a fuck about you if 
you're holding them and feeding them 

634
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,211
everyday and they were a little little 
thing on your arm and you get shot in 

635
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:07,211
the head with a howitzer,
they'll go,

636
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:08,240
well I guess I'm not hanging out here 
anymore.

637
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,460
There's fly away.
They don't get sad.

638
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,350
They don't feel bad.
Those birds of prayer trip,

639
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:15,950
there was a hawk that landed on our 
ranch and we knew something was off with

640
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,750
it because it was just hanging around 
the house.

641
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,850
So my parents were like,
all right,

642
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,260
we got to try and bring it in.

643
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,820
We got to try and get it to the bed or 
something.

644
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:27,821
Whoa.
So they sent me with a kitchen where 

645
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:27,821
they sure have bullets.
Yeah,

646
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:32,640
exactly.
With the kitchen glove and a little 

647
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,220
piece of steak yet though.
So I'm like going very slowly,

648
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:37,010
like looking at this hawk and the.
I like thinking of the options.

649
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,640
Do I do I run like what happened?
But you know,

650
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,130
it turned out that it was the 
domesticated hawk,

651
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:47,190
so I was able to give it to meet and 
then it dug it and then it hopped on the

652
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:50,900
kitchen glove that's brought it into the
house they rescued it.

653
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,880
Does it for,
for that to have happened?

654
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,090
I don't know.
I'm glad I found out because we asked 

655
00:26:59,090 --> 00:26:59,760
him like,
have you done this before?

656
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,330
Yeah,
we do have time on your glove,

657
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,400
Bro.
What animal would you be?

658
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,250
Shut the fuck up.

659
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,900
Brian's on a date,
Chris.

660
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,650
And that was right there with you.
Oh actually we have to know the answer 

661
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,930
to one of those things.
If someone asks you,

662
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:20,050
what's your favorite color?
Like,

663
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,030
Yo,
shut up Dick.

664
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,100
Meanwhile,
it is a valid question.

665
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,160
Maybe you have a reason why you're into 
violet.

666
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:30,161
I'm into purple,
Fuchsia,

667
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,700
Fuchsia,
Fuchsia,

668
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:37,450
car,
radical hidden camera on trademarks.

669
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:38,690
I'm kind of pink.
Is it?

670
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,770
Did really good for trademark it.
Boy.

671
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,800
Hobby Vasquez.
He fights in pink shorts.

672
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,330
He wears.
He wears pink.

673
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:49,170
A pink little fucking tighties when he.
When he fights,

674
00:27:49,171 --> 00:27:51,690
he fights fights to strikeforce.
A bad motherfucker.

675
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,160
We fights for WC.
Excuse me,

676
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:55,980
he was fighting for a.
You want to King of the cage title?

677
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,560
He Won.
He's fought in Japan and one over there.

678
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,050
He always wears pink shorts.
He doesn't give a fuck.

679
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:06,110
No one wants to be close up to see if 
the stars are clearing out.

680
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,250
It's just pink shorts and a package.
There's another dude that,

681
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:12,810
dude,
I'm the fuck is his name.

682
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,900
Tim Kennedy.
Tim Kennedy always trains with pink 

683
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,510
gloves.
He wears these big fucking girly looking

684
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:20,010
pink gloves.
But he's like,

685
00:28:20,011 --> 00:28:25,011
he's like,
when you're a fierce motherfucker you 

686
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:25,011
can wear pink.
Right?

687
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:25,011
I can totally make sense.
You know,

688
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:27,300
how did the color get to be so 
disparaged?

689
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,180
Why the traditional girl color?
I mean,

690
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,000
what is if people gave it to girls on 
the,

691
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,620
on the baby shower day,
you know,

692
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,130
so it was just try why they end up pink 
all over the world.

693
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,860
There's not like,
are they in the like in Transylvania,

694
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:42,630
a little girls in a black little,
little,

695
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:47,010
little goth girls make the big colorful 
little girls the prettiest color.

696
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:48,000
You know,
I think if you're,

697
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,060
you don't want red because that's like 
an eagle pass my faggot test piece.

698
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:58,260
The prettiest sparkly pink.
Get to keep the name pink.

699
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,590
You know the singer pink is nobody else 
been pink.

700
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,780
How does that mean?
That bitch got the best name for a 

701
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:06,780
chick.
Could have ever like,

702
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,870
what's the girliest should ever gangster
all girls love pink deserves it.

703
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,490
But she does deserve it.
She's,

704
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,500
she's a bad ass,
you know that uh,

705
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:17,580
I wrote a whole blog about watching her 
perform at the emmy's that I watched.

706
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,430
I watched her perform and I was like,
you gotta be fucking shitting me.

707
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,610
Like that was just sheer brilliance in 
coordination with perfect singing and 

708
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,180
just just so in tune with the crowd and 
had everyone mesmerized.

709
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:31,600
It was fucking beyond.
Yeah.

710
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,810
But I'm just shocked that nobody got 
paint before.

711
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,280
I mean,
she's not old.

712
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,730
It's not like she got there first like 
nobody thought to call themselves pink.

713
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,800
It seems like there probably was.
I bet some fucking dummy that just 

714
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:43,800
didn't trademark it.
Right?

715
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,270
Yeah.

716
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,290
Way before that whole Charlie Chaplin 
was pink.

717
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:55,291
Once she don't,
she don't.

718
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,180
She heard about me,
she heard about me.

719
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,380
I created my name,
my name.

720
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,610
There's always when,
whenever someone famous gets famous,

721
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:10,400
there's always someone that thinks that 
the,

722
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,940
the,
that happens all the time.

723
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,920
Oh,
he's got my whole act.

724
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,670
That's my whole routine.
I was doing that in the catskills.

725
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,290
Everything

726
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,570
he knows.
I've heard that story so many times that

727
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,070
a guy makes it and then you go,
Oh,

728
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:27,071
you know that guy made it.
But there was a guy back in like 

729
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:30,640
Michigan who was scared to leave town,
but he was the guy he learned from that 

730
00:30:31,101 --> 00:30:33,200
guy like you,
like there's like creamer.

731
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:36,240
This is a real Kramer Kramer from 
Seinfeld,

732
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:41,241
but there's a real dude.
He calls himself the real Kramer and he 

733
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:44,120
gives tours of New York.
He was the guy that burst through doors,

734
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:48,980
like universally acknowledged as the guy
who inspired that character.

735
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,340
So he somehow or another,
they let them capitalize on it and gives

736
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,580
tours and shit,
which has got to be so twisted.

737
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,570
Yeah.
And Boring.

738
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,270
Maybe not man.
Maybe for him it's like the shit,

739
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,620
you know,
maybe if he was a dentist he'd be bored 

740
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:05,660
and maybe if I,
my dentist had his job,

741
00:31:05,661 --> 00:31:08,590
he'd be terrified.
Maybe.

742
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,540
Maybe the dentist themselves mean who 
knows what,

743
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,740
if he made really supposed to be Kramer,
the guy's got to be very eccentric.

744
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:20,741
Right.
I mean if that's really the guy who 

745
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:20,741
they,
they.

746
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:20,741
Yeah.
You know,

747
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:23,190
after you.
Fuck what,

748
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:28,310
what does that guy do now?
I've seen him in randomly and placements

749
00:31:28,701 --> 00:31:30,620
and appearances.
Railing recently.

750
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,970
You're talking about Kramer?
Yeah,

751
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,890
the real one.
Yeah.

752
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,540
What the fuck's his knees about to go on
somehow.

753
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,400
Forgot how.
Come on.

754
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,640
Michael Richards.
Thanks.

755
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,740
He just attacked the photographer the 
other day.

756
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,720
Did he take it together?

757
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:49,180
I guess he punched him and stuff.
That's one of the worst predicaments in 

758
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,201
the history of the media for an actor,
for an actor to have done that was one 

759
00:31:54,051 --> 00:31:55,970
of the worst predicaments,
you know,

760
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,860
that's like,
you know,

761
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,690
like people have caught people with 
hookers,

762
00:31:59,691 --> 00:32:02,550
like hugh grant got busted with hookers 
and you know,

763
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,500
and Alec Baldwin yelled at his kid.
That's all good.

764
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,430
But you know,
it's not that bad.

765
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:11,190
No.
Right.

766
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,240
The world out here as a nigger,
there's,

767
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:15,410
look,
we have a nigger,

768
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,520
he says Joe,
and I mean,

769
00:32:16,521 --> 00:32:18,050
I know it.
I know what he was trying to do.

770
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,650
Spoil alert.
What is trying to spoil spoiling,

771
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,660
right?
What he was trying to do is say 

772
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,031
something completely shocking and 
somehow another rescue himself from a 

773
00:32:29,061 --> 00:32:34,061
bad situation where he was bombing and 
he wanted to figure out how to get them 

774
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:34,440
out to hurt them.
How to shop,

775
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,740
how to let them know that he didn't give
a fuck.

776
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,490
You know,
like,

777
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,930
Oh,
you're going to fuck with my show.

778
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,010
Think it's okay.
Oh you

779
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,320
think because I'm on Seinfeld,
I won't get crazy at you.

780
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,090
Oh look,
here's a nigger.

781
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,130
Look,
we have some niggers,

782
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,810
you know.
And everybody was like,

783
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:49,490
Whoa,
what the fuck?

784
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:55,390
It's shocking.
But what's most shocking to me is that 

785
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,811
that word still works.
It's one of the few still freak out 

786
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:02,690
though has magic in it still has that 
ability to affect people.

787
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,150
It's interesting.
It's amazing.

788
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,650
The only one left.
The other one I think couldn't have done

789
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:11,330
it.
I have a whole bit about the three magic

790
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:11,900
words,
love,

791
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:12,610
Nigger,
and count.

792
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Those are the three words are the three 
magic words that have the word love 

793
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,580
always has way more power than than any 
other words you could string together.

794
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:24,920
Like I care about you so much.
I think about you all day.

795
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,060
I just.
I don't know what it is.

796
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:27,000
I just want him around you.

797
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,600
I want to be affectionate and do you 
love me?

798
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,550
You have to say it.
You have to say I love you.

799
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,970
I love.
Oh well,

800
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,640
we're in.
We're in the house.

801
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:39,641
We're in the house.
We all go in and that's magic word 

802
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:39,641
number one.
Can't sort of.

803
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:42,000
But that's getting used a lot.
It gets tossed,

804
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,280
especially in a walmart cards now,
so I don't think it's hallmark using cut

805
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:49,430
and cards in England.
They can't all the time.

806
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:52,870
Everything's caught this fucking cunt.
Fucking dudes.

807
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:53,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

808
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:55,290
This fucking cunt over here.
Yeah.

809
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:00,300
They,
they start it up so much that it's like 

810
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:00,300
this fucking dude.
It's like they're saying,

811
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,490
dude are going to be left with two 
words,

812
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,740
but.
But niggers still very,

813
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,690
very controversial.
You know,

814
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:09,110
and just even the joke of my act,
I would say that even saying it's a word

815
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:14,140
like I'm not even calling anybody yet,
we're just saying the word and you're 

816
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,550
like candyman candyman character.

817
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,790
It is like that.
It's like you're in your,

818
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,730
you're,
you're saying and in contention is going

819
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,470
to bring violence your way.
Like you,

820
00:34:20,471 --> 00:34:22,130
you are,
you are using a bad word.

821
00:34:22,131 --> 00:34:24,380
You're not even calling anybody 
anything.

822
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,690
You just saying that this word exists.
And in,

823
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,690
in,
in incanting it and saying it out loud,

824
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,670
you know,
you run the risk of violence.

825
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,940
That's amazing.
That's amazing that it's 2010 and we 

826
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,240
think that's okay.
I think it's one of the few words were,

827
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:40,190
I can't even hear my own voice saying 
[inaudible].

828
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,350
I don't think I've had the courage to 
voice.

829
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,760
It's just a word.
I say it all the time and you fucking 

830
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:47,960
tell me how you do.
Tell me what you say.

831
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:49,280
Fucking nigger.
Whoa.

832
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,530
That was offensive.
Brian.

833
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,700
I thought you were going to say n word,
n word.

834
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:59,120
That's even more offensive pictures.
Feel free to swear in front of you.

835
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,860
You might be wearing a wire,
you dirty n word,

836
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,130
but she's not really one,
so it's not bad.

837
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,160
You know,
if she was really a black then it would 

838
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,160
feel bad,
but she's white.

839
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,670
Could be white.
You could be a white nigger.

840
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,110
I think that's an a song somewhere.
I'm sure it is.

841
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,640
What's a wigger no nigger brand?
Stop saying that.

842
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,680
It's uncomfortable for everyone.
We just weirded out half.

843
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,310
Wouldn't have America ridiculous as 
100,000

844
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:30,920
people this thing.
Listen folks,

845
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,450
so they're just words.
That's the point.

846
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,820
It's a ridiculous point that's been 
argued throughout time.

847
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:36,530
It shouldn't,
shouldn't be still going on.

848
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,820
It shouldn't be.
It should always be your intent.

849
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,180
It should always be like whenever you're
in any environment where you're not 

850
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,511
allowed to say certain words,
you make that environment at least 20 

851
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:49,770
percent bullshit at all times.
Any work environment that you're at,

852
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:51,960
nobody's really totally being 
themselves.

853
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:57,170
Everybody has to have this stupid guard 
up because you can't say company can't 

854
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,951
say fuck,
and you can't say shit and you can't 

855
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:01,050
talk honestly about how you feel about 
things.

856
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:06,051
No,
you're in a professional working 

857
00:36:06,051 --> 00:36:06,051
environment except that flashlight.
I'll have to accept that.

858
00:36:06,051 --> 00:36:07,500
Especially Chris by the way works at 
flashlights.

859
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:12,590
Chris is,
what is your exact job over there was 

860
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,170
your vp of marketing and business that 
he's a.

861
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,630
The reason why we made the connection 
and uh,

862
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,750
he's also the reason why they have an 
avatar flashlight.

863
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,190
Let me say this correct.
Just as a correction.

864
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:25,191
This is not,
I say I was the alien pussy realities.

865
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,950
We blue.
We actually launched this two years ago 

866
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,230
with we totally,
which is our space.

867
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,880
We pushed this out two years ago.
It was just a space vagina.

868
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,660
We put some girls and some blue lipstick
and.

869
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,500
Oh,
so this was.

870
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,680
But it just happens that they're super 
hot.

871
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,620
And here's the,
that you didn't even make it look like a

872
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:46,230
vagina at all.
I like how you did that.

873
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,130
Like doubleclick is a whole bunch of 
thought of this.

874
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,620
The mold inside is like a bunch of 
eggshells.

875
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,520
Greg's every site has a,
the bowl has like different ribs inside.

876
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,200
The urban myth,
is that an urban myth,

877
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,390
the razor blade in the vagina from 
Vietnam,

878
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,870
is that an urban myth?
I've never been do that.

879
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:14,930
You never heard that?
Now hookers would take these back in 

880
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,330
Vietnam was like when I was a kid in 
high school.

881
00:37:16,331 --> 00:37:18,480
When you're growing up in Boston,
back in Vietnam,

882
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:23,481
I heard what they did.
They took a razor blades and they put 

883
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:24,300
them up the girl's vagina and he'd fuck 
them and cut your Dick and half.

884
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,580
You never heard that before?

885
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,330
I hung out with a bad crowd.
If you heard of the rape condoms.

886
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,830
I've heard of those.
Yeah.

887
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:36,150
They have little spikes that stick.
They shove it in the girl.

888
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:38,310
The girl shoves it inside of her like a 
Tampon.

889
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:43,311
Okay.
And it's basically like an interior 

890
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:44,820
lining for her vagina that's filled with
barbs.

891
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,320
Like fucking with fish hook type deals.
So these guys,

892
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,920
they rape a lot apparently in Africa.
It's like a serious,

893
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:54,600
serious problem.
Super in right now.

894
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,930
It's like one out of three women in 
Africa has been raped.

895
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:03,260
Certain areas of Africa,
and this is one of the areas where 

896
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,650
they're pushing these rape condoms,
like those guys are going to kill now.

897
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,900
Now it's not just going to be raped,
it's going to be rape and murder.

898
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:12,110
You know,
if a guy sticks his dick inside you and 

899
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:12,110
comes out bloody and covered with fish 
hooks,

900
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,020
chances are I might hit you,
right?

901
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Yeah.
He's raping you an asshole that he would

902
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,800
so give you a moment,
but it was such an asshole that he would

903
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:27,801
rape you.
You don't think he'll kill you if you 

904
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:27,801
cut his dick up,
guys,

905
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:28,200
a piece of shit,
you know he's not going to go you,

906
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,570
you were really shouldn't have raped 
you.

907
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,700
I got fish hooks on my dick.
I deserve it.

908
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Yeah.
No,

909
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,380
he's going to attack you,
right?

910
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:35,950
I would

911
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,220
assume.
Yeah.

912
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,640
I just thought I was actually out there 
in Africa,

913
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:40,480
Kenya,
Tanzania,

914
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:45,481
Uganda,
and out with some of the tribes when we 

915
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:47,791
were working with some of the men out 
there to try and actually instill 

916
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,840
traditional martial arts into them so 
that they could see some kind of martial

917
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:51,370
arts in the tribesmen.
Yeah,

918
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:56,430
and some of the inner inner city to slum
kids because really they have a whole 

919
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,610
generation of fathers that are gone from
aids,

920
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:01,360
just no father figures so they have no 
nothing else to really go to.

921
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:06,361
So they get picked up by gangs,
they get picked up by these war parties 

922
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:06,361
and then they get turned into little 
killer.

923
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:10,891
So what we trying to do is show them 
some kind of paternal discipline and 

924
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:13,120
show them that they can be strong and 
powerful without having to be in a gang.

925
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,820
And it was a really cool program and it 
worked,

926
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,890
but it's fucking intense out there,
man.

927
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Really intense.
We ended up having to stop the program 

928
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,700
because civil war broke out in Kenya and
it was just too nutty to keep doing it.

929
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,660
Damn it was.
It was pretty crazy over there teaching 

930
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,510
them martial arts.
Yup.

931
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,220
Wow.
Very true.

932
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,230
Like traditional stylized,
you know,

933
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:37,880
we weren't going into MMA ground and 
pound.

934
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:42,881
She's like discipline karate type 
through the Kata and definitely speaking

935
00:39:43,151 --> 00:39:44,680
to them and they.
I mean they dug it.

936
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,700
I know it's kind of interesting that 
Africa is not known for martial arts,

937
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,880
you know,
it's like Africa is the cradle of 

938
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:53,880
civilization,
right?

939
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,701
That's where humans emanated from.
But really martial arts didn't really 

940
00:39:56,701 --> 00:40:00,271
pick up until they got to like Asia.
I mean there was other martial arts are 

941
00:40:00,271 --> 00:40:03,091
developed in other countries,
but for whatever reason I think it's 

942
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:03,850
because Africa was so fucked up.
They just went straight to weapons.

943
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:04,750
Like,
what are we doing?

944
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,280
Karate Chop.
Give me a gun,

945
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,320
another gun,
give me a pointy stick,

946
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:11,250
man.
Give me some shit.

947
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:14,700
I gotta stab some fucking animals with 
some hyenas trying to eat my kids.

948
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:16,050
All right.
You can't just,

949
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:21,110
you know,
fucking box of like in Ireland how many 

950
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,010
tiny man in Ireland,
you know,

951
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:24,990
what do they have to worry about?
Deer gets into your yard.

952
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:30,290
You know what I'm saying?
They had time to beat the fuck out of 

953
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:30,290
each other.
Whiskey bottle.

954
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,520
They didn't even bother learning mma.
I didn't even bother with take downs or 

955
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:33,520
leg kicks or anything like that.
Like,

956
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:33,660
ah,
this is good enough.

957
00:40:33,661 --> 00:40:38,661
Just here's our hands.
We don't need to get crazy with the 

958
00:40:38,661 --> 00:40:38,670
knees.
Come on a flattery,

959
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,420
elbows and against the rules.
That's why you hit me with that.

960
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,250
We're not trying to kill each other.
Then in Africa they're like,

961
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,740
fuck you.

962
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,840
They're going right for pointy sticks to
your chest.

963
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,660
Poison Darts and shit.
Blow guns.

964
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,170
Yeah.
They're just trying to.

965
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:58,220
They're trying to jack you.
The exception is the Greco Roman style 

966
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,400
wrestling with some of the tribes out.
Really good.

967
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:01,560
Greco and Africa.
Some of the tribes.

968
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:03,600
That's how.
That's what determines the Alpha and the

969
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:04,640
tribe.
Really.

970
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,810
All kinds of crazy rituals like they 
have good technique.

971
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:08,880
Do you think you could take their back?
Yeah,

972
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,870
dude,
no way.

973
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,970
No way you can get them to get on top.
Sweep his ass.

974
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:20,140
Got No baby all tearing web regard.
You Ain't know.

975
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,600
You know about my lockdown popping up 
and down.

976
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:24,690
All the sudden he's choked out.
She could have gone on your bitch.

977
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,660
You got a problem.
You've got a deep problem.

978
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:30,960
It got with shit and his loin cloth.
So what kind of wrestling and they do.

979
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:31,980
Well,
it's just like,

980
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,020
you know,
like Greco Roman,

981
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,860
you know,
Nicole,

982
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:40,930
do they understand under hooks hook.
So what kind of throws throws that are 

983
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,970
like judo throws,
throws,

984
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:48,530
throws.
I mean you like an all American 

985
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:48,530
restaurant.
I'm rolling Jack All.

986
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,230
I mean they don't have the nutrition and
the training and eating bugs and shit.

987
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Then I go for you Greco bugs that are 
good for your regular drinking some 

988
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,490
stuff out the goat blood.
Have you,

989
00:41:59,491 --> 00:42:04,491
you know,
we were talking about this on the show 

990
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:04,491
before,
but in Africa,

991
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:05,810
trip panning and when you cut a hole 
into the top of the head,

992
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,050
have you ever seen that?
No.

993
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,260
Dude,
some tribes in Africa,

994
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,620
the gnarliest shit to their bodies and 
I've always tried to figure out what 

995
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,260
that is.
We're where,

996
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,640
where,
where's that coming from?

997
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:22,060
But one of them is trapping t r e p a n 
and what it means cutting a hole through

998
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:26,030
the skull and exposing the brain.

999
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,430
And this one guy had done it 20 times.
Antiseptic conditions?

1000
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,040
No.
Yeah,

1001
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,750
they're doing it with coconut shells and
shit.

1002
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,390
Fucking cut your head open with a sharp 
rock.

1003
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,880
And I'm not joking,
they are using rocks and shit,

1004
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:38,870
carving,
carving,

1005
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,520
no,
no anesthetic whatsoever.

1006
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,970
Carving into dude skulls.
And then the women in Surrey who cut the

1007
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:47,330
hole in their lip and they put plates in
and the bigger the plate,

1008
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,760
the more cows you're worth when you get 
married.

1009
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,490
Like what is that about?
What is all those?

1010
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,090
Those are tough to figure out.
The ones that are on vacation,

1011
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,930
they did a lot of that one that's easier
to figure out.

1012
00:42:56,931 --> 00:43:01,931
But I think it's maybe the worst is the 
clutter ectomies are done by the 

1013
00:43:01,931 --> 00:43:01,931
masseuse.
Traditional math.

1014
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,440
I mean just them,
right?

1015
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,170
More bad and it's just know.
And then once,

1016
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,460
you know,
once they do that,

1017
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:12,320
like sex is just never pleasurable.

1018
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,360
So I mean it's,
you know,

1019
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,400
they're trying to do it,
do it because they're haters,

1020
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,400
they're haters.
They can't,

1021
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,410
they have no game and they want to 
control these chicks for life.

1022
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,960
And then the chick turns 22 wises up be 
like,

1023
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:25,250
dude,
you fucking smell.

1024
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,310
I'm not into this relationship.
I'm going to get some good Dick.

1025
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:33,370
Right?
And she tries to leave and to my 

1026
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:33,370
property.
And then they have problems,

1027
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:33,950
you know,
it's a bunch of haters,

1028
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:38,951
man.
It's all those faggots and won't let 

1029
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:38,951
chicks dance.
All those dudes who want to put chips in

1030
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:40,360
Burkas and shit,
but your eyes,

1031
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:46,150
you know,
they want them to walk around like 

1032
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:46,150
they're inside of a trashcan looking 
through a slot.

1033
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,380
I'll totally insecurity.
There's little faggots,

1034
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,260
bitch ass people living in the middle of
nowhere for sure.

1035
00:43:52,261 --> 00:43:55,130
If it's the dumbest place in the world 
because it's the first place.

1036
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:00,580
I always say that,
that the Middle East is basically they 

1037
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,960
like the townies of the world because 
that is where written language was 

1038
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,151
created.
I mean the Middle East is responsible 

1039
00:44:07,151 --> 00:44:07,151
for so many firsts.
You know,

1040
00:44:07,151 --> 00:44:11,201
Mesopotamia Babylonia,
where Iraq is ancient Sumerian or they 

1041
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:13,970
had the first written language,
the first agriculture,

1042
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,550
the first government,
the first astrology,

1043
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:19,630
the first astronomy.
I mean they had a lot of,

1044
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,740
a lot of first,
there was a brilliant,

1045
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:23,210
brilliant place.
I mean so much.

1046
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:26,000
So much development,
but everybody,

1047
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,490
like in all good places,
they got tired of the Douche bags and he

1048
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:33,491
moved and everybody's spread out.
Civilization spread out across the 

1049
00:44:33,491 --> 00:44:33,491
country.
It's just like America.

1050
00:44:33,491 --> 00:44:36,030
If you go the east coast,
you get a lot of holdouts.

1051
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,040
That's what it is.
A lot of stubborn people that go,

1052
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:41,610
I fucking like in here,
fuck everybody else and what they really

1053
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:46,230
are is the grandchildren and children of
fucking savages.

1054
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,250
People in Ireland and Poland and 
England,

1055
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:55,570
that that life over there sucked so much
cock that they were willing to get in a 

1056
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,320
boat for months and come to them 
someplace,

1057
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,440
didn't even know what the fuck it was,
and suddenly they get there and then 

1058
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,421
they huddle up and they try to figure 
out this new place and fight off the 

1059
00:45:05,421 --> 00:45:08,181
fucking Indians.
Do whatever they have to do to make a 

1060
00:45:08,181 --> 00:45:08,181
business and get everybody's smart 
goals.

1061
00:45:08,181 --> 00:45:09,390
There's got to be someplace better than 
this.

1062
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:12,570
Let's get the fuck out of here.
And they started traveling west.

1063
00:45:12,571 --> 00:45:15,690
Devote your vital energy to something 
besides bear survival.

1064
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:20,710
Yeah,
so the VAT is the civilization 

1065
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:24,350
beginning.
Assume Sumir and that is Iraq and that 

1066
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:24,350
is the Middle East,
the middle.

1067
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:25,020
That's why the Middle East is so fucked 
up.

1068
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,370
That's where there's such haters over 
there,

1069
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:26,970
you know,
I have,

1070
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:29,370
I have a theory that I don't think has 
been explored very much,

1071
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:32,160
but it seems like in the desert areas of
the world,

1072
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:34,780
they're very patriarchal dominated,
you know,

1073
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:36,870
and then you get to the coast land,
you get to the jungles,

1074
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:41,871
they have a lot more matriarchal 
societies that have a lot more respect 

1075
00:45:41,871 --> 00:45:42,720
for women and the religions or appear 
different.

1076
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,780
Something about that dry,
arid landscape.

1077
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:46,390
And of course,
you know,

1078
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,210
the major desert religions,
Judaism,

1079
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:51,150
Christianity,
Islam has really taken hold there.

1080
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:56,151
But for whatever reason,
that kind of patriarchal dominance that 

1081
00:45:56,151 --> 00:45:56,460
occurs out there and those

1082
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:58,620
different.
Yeah,

1083
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,630
it's a hard life.
It demands hard,

1084
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,710
hard living,
you know,

1085
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,680
you have to make,
you got to be.

1086
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:08,860
And you also have to realize that they 
had this hard radical ideology thousands

1087
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,050
and thousands of years ago and a hard 
radical ideologies.

1088
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:15,330
It's very difficult to break without a 
revolution.

1089
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,790
It doesn't sort of evolve,
you know,

1090
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:22,791
if their ideology about like,
and I don't know how recent it's been 

1091
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:26,121
that they've been so strict with women 
with the glitter ectomies and with the 

1092
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:26,790
Burkas and I mean how,
how recent has that been?

1093
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,510
I mean it's still going on there,
right?

1094
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,900
But I mean when did it start?
I mean,

1095
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,730
how it is it,
is it something that's been going on for

1096
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:35,300
hundreds and thousands of these?
100?

1097
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,280
I don't know.
I don't know.

1098
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:42,350
When you have a situation where there's 
a lot of fear and a lot of religious 

1099
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,801
fanaticism,
it's really hard to change because 

1100
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:45,801
everybody's scared.

1101
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:48,630
Well,
even the females for the clitoral 

1102
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:48,630
ectomies,
some of them feel like they can't become

1103
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:48,730
a woman until they get it.

1104
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,480
It's so ingrained.
So if they make it illegal,

1105
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:56,540
what's,
it's actually forcing some women 

1106
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,340
underground to get them done and even 
worse conditions than the flint rock and

1107
00:46:57,341 --> 00:46:58,200
a chisel or whatever

1108
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,370
done.
So it's a,

1109
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:01,240
it's a nightmare.
I mean,

1110
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:03,310
you really got to attack it with 
education,

1111
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,830
you know?
I mean that's the only real option.

1112
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:10,950
It's a,
it's one of those things where I think 

1113
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:10,950
about,
you know,

1114
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,010
there's certain,
certain levels of fear when it gets,

1115
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:17,070
when fear gets ingrained into a culture 
and when it's control and that's what a 

1116
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:21,181
lot of that is a lot of this,
the controlling of lemon with the 

1117
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:23,260
clothing and the dancing and you know,
to try to prevent other men from fucking

1118
00:47:23,261 --> 00:47:24,430
them and all that craziness.
Right.

1119
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:29,650
When,
when that should get a hold of a 

1120
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:29,650
culture,
it's very hard to get it out.

1121
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,320
You know what I'm saying?
Like it takes like a new person or a 

1122
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:34,320
person.
Sure.

1123
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:34,320
Yeah,
sure.

1124
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,820
Absolutely.
But at least a culture or a person 

1125
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:38,860
rather than responsible for themselves.
Like people can wake up and go,

1126
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:39,820
Hey,
I'm a douche bag.

1127
00:47:39,821 --> 00:47:44,821
I need to snap out of this.
It's very difficult for a culture to 

1128
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:44,821
wake up and go,
hey,

1129
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:44,821
we're fucked up.

1130
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:46,420
You know,
look what we're doing overseas.

1131
00:47:46,421 --> 00:47:51,421
Look at were pretending that this is 
going on and we're making billions and 

1132
00:47:51,421 --> 00:47:51,820
we've got all these fucking dummies that
are listening to us.

1133
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:52,760
We can do better.
Right.

1134
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,950
It's very rare that a culture wakes up,
we're a government wakes up or any large

1135
00:47:56,951 --> 00:47:58,480
group,
but a person can wake up.

1136
00:47:58,481 --> 00:47:58,870
Right.
You know,

1137
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,580
I mean,
I think the best thing to do would be to

1138
00:48:00,581 --> 00:48:04,930
put Internet kiosks fucking everywhere 
or just put that in satellite Internet.

1139
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,390
Just get them out there and have them 
watch spice girls.

1140
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,480
Like at that point,
you know,

1141
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:13,000
they're going to say a quitter and kind 
of do that with the laptops you have.

1142
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:15,350
You seen those things as like,
are they getting into.

1143
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,580
They're like throwing them in,
but they.

1144
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:24,630
Yeah,
they definitely need some big 

1145
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:27,270
inoculation of the retardation they've 
gone through for decades and hundreds 

1146
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:28,390
and thousands of years.

1147
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:33,630
You know,
they need something to get them to 

1148
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:35,341
evolve.
When you get like people that are just 

1149
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:38,101
so wacky about a certain ideology to the
point where there is so nutty that 

1150
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,540
you're not even allowed to draw their 
main dude.

1151
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,200
No.
Yeah.

1152
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,700
Think how crazy that is.
You can't draw their main guy or they'll

1153
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:48,610
kill you.
Why do we tolerate this?

1154
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:53,020
Why does anyone tolerate that?
That is absolutely crazy.

1155
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:53,560
Yeah.
Like,

1156
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:58,561
it's not saying no one saying that 
Mohammed doesn't exist or never did 

1157
00:48:58,561 --> 00:48:58,561
exist,
or he's not a prophet.

1158
00:48:58,561 --> 00:48:59,020
He might very well be,
I'm,

1159
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,330
I am completely uneducated to that 
matter,

1160
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:03,670
but you're telling me that you can't 
draw them.

1161
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,800
Come on,
that's silly.

1162
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,380
One of the tenants,
I had a great philosophy instructor when

1163
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:13,381
I was going to school and one of the 
tenants that he thought he was 

1164
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:13,381
philosophy of religion,
a specialist,

1165
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:15,700
and he said,
any God that should be worship should be

1166
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:16,750
worthy of worship.

1167
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,980
You know,
so if you're a god in someone's drawing 

1168
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,051
you and you're going to Mike them,
I mean that dude isn't worthy of 

1169
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:25,960
followers that smite.
Right?

1170
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:31,300
But it's because it was fighting because
they feel it's an offense to God right 

1171
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,020
now.
Like if someone's drawing you,

1172
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:37,140
you're not going to get pissed.
So does that mean that you're better 

1173
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,140
than God?
It can't be.

1174
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,740
You can't have a system where you know 
the god isn't worthy of worship and 

1175
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,950
being as good as another man.
And this was my,

1176
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,360
my thought is that all of this is seem.
It seems so archaic and ridiculous.

1177
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:51,600
It seems so several thousand years ago,
it's amazing that this kind of ideology 

1178
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,840
is allowed to live through this age of 
information like deep into the two 

1179
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:57,840
thousands.
So that's.

1180
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,860
That's fascinating.
It's fascinating.

1181
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:00,850
Yeah,
it is.

1182
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:06,060
I think there's a real grain of truth at
the bottom of all these religions says 

1183
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:06,060
I'm beautiful things.

1184
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:06,490
I mean,
I'm sure in the Koran,

1185
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,500
you know,
I'm not as familiar as I am with some of

1186
00:50:08,501 --> 00:50:10,030
the other works,
but I've seen a little bit,

1187
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,730
here's beautiful passages,
spiritual,

1188
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:16,480
spiritual,
and really powerfully beautiful passages

1189
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:17,380
and all that.
But then,

1190
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:22,560
you know,
men get in there and they're able to 

1191
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,350
utilize that as a mechanism of power to 
wield more power over other people.

1192
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:26,860
It just gets kinda twisted.
What's the origin of it all?

1193
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,880
I mean,
if it isn't the word of God,

1194
00:50:28,881 --> 00:50:33,881
what is it?
Is it smart people who figure some 

1195
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:36,491
things out and somehow or another figure
out how to tell it to people and those 

1196
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:40,181
people tell it to each other for 
thousands of years and then it 

1197
00:50:40,181 --> 00:50:42,731
eventually gets written down and by that
point it's become fables and the words 

1198
00:50:42,731 --> 00:50:46,430
have been twisted and things have gotten
strange and the translations are off the

1199
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:48,200
memories off,
you know,

1200
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:50,240
I mean if you're dealing with something 
as big as the Bible,

1201
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:52,310
how many hundreds of pages that it's a 
lot.

1202
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:57,140
It's a lot.
So you do try to like say it is a spoken

1203
00:50:57,141 --> 00:51:00,560
word thing for like a thousand years and
then they wrote it down.

1204
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,220
It was a while and they had a council to
decide,

1205
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,240
you know,
it was like an editing where they 

1206
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:08,240
decided which now this goes in.

1207
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,180
How about the fucking New Testament,
the new testament that even better than 

1208
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,731
that,
there were candidates for the new 

1209
00:51:14,731 --> 00:51:14,731
testament.
They just threw out there,

1210
00:51:14,731 --> 00:51:16,360
like the editor just recently redid it.
Oh,

1211
00:51:16,361 --> 00:51:17,440
the region is.
Yeah.

1212
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:18,720
They have like a newer,
newer tests.

1213
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,980
Yeah.
I was just talking to Jesus and shit and

1214
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:25,700
he got some old notes.
We've got some old Tupac tapes and Jesus

1215
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,030
is like Tupac.
They're redoing his words,

1216
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:33,270
talking snake sheet with a bunch of 
apostles that willing to and all that.

1217
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,950
I don't care if we know Jesus.
They chose

1218
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,330
words that fitted their fitted their 
agenda.

1219
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,990
Yeah.
Well that was constantine.

1220
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,210
That was one constant team was 
controlling Rome.

1221
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:43,710
He's.
He was a smart dude.

1222
00:51:43,711 --> 00:51:46,770
He realized he needed a rope people up 
with one universal religion.

1223
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:47,820
It couldn't be pagan

1224
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:51,580
that at that point though,
the slave class had really outnumbered,

1225
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,080
you know,
the other classes.

1226
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:54,090
So he was,
you know,

1227
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,810
he says it came to him in a dream or 
whatever,

1228
00:51:55,811 --> 00:52:00,811
but I think he was trying to survive the
Christianity spread in the lower 

1229
00:52:00,811 --> 00:52:04,231
classes.
I mean they idealize that theory that 

1230
00:52:04,231 --> 00:52:07,561
they were going to go to heaven and all 
these rich people who are putting them 

1231
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:07,561
to work and doing shitty stuff to him,
they were going to go to hell.

1232
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:09,730
So it took off and then he was like,
oh shit.

1233
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,970
Almost our entire country is slaves.
I'm a Christian.

1234
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,200
Like Bam,
I had a dream,

1235
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:14,620
you know,
and,

1236
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,720
and then that's what,
that's what did it,

1237
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,100
you know,
he says it came to him in a dream,

1238
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:19,360
but really I think it was survival.

1239
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,930
The Christians were just taken over that

1240
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:27,360
it was just too many in that lower class
versus the patricians who were well 

1241
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,030
outnumbered at that point.

1242
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:33,130
That's fascinating.
So it was a survival move more than 

1243
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:33,130
control move.

1244
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,610
I think so at that point,
the adoption of Christianity,

1245
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:35,910
it was like he saw the flood,
you know,

1246
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:40,980
he saw the tide's going and he was going
to either get trampled by it or he was 

1247
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:41,080
gonna go with.

1248
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:43,980
Wouldn't you have loved to been in that 
war meeting?

1249
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,150
Yeah,
for real.

1250
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:46,830
All right,
well how are we going to handle this?

1251
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,330
I go,
we got some shit.

1252
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,550
Some shit is going down.
This is what people.

1253
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:53,010
They would pitchforks and torches and 
shit.

1254
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,480
Yeah.
Feeding him to the lions was just so mad

1255
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:56,500
at that point.
Let's tell him.

1256
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:59,110
We found Jesus.
I liked that sound.

1257
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:01,380
We found God.
I'm fucking.

1258
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,510
I'm born again.
I don't know about y'all.

1259
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,240
Are you born again?
I'm totally bored again.

1260
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:07,920
We can still keep everything going as 
usual.

1261
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:08,220
Yeah,
yeah,

1262
00:53:08,221 --> 00:53:08,640
yeah,
yeah.

1263
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:10,290
We bring them in.
We're going to have to include them,

1264
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:12,620
but they're not going to kill us.
Okay.

1265
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,560
We're good.
We're born again.

1266
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:18,561
We're born again.
History has changed and he didn't even 

1267
00:53:18,901 --> 00:53:20,520
become a Christian until right before he
died.

1268
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:21,400
Yeah.
You know,

1269
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,490
right.
Wasn't he baptized before he died?

1270
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,070
The timing for

1271
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,730
a long time in a while.
I mean,

1272
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,450
he didn't start leading,
tucking my fucking head in the water.

1273
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,070
You got to do it.
You got to do it.

1274
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,050
They don't believe you unless you do it.
Fucking kitten.

1275
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:36,300
The water,
the water sucks.

1276
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:38,700
It's cold.
You got to do their thing.

1277
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:43,020
Get in the water is on point is you 
posted a video about him,

1278
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:45,720
but I've read all of his books.
Is John Shelby spong.

1279
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:48,240
Um,
why Christianity must change or die?

1280
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:49,950
I think you actually posted a youtube 
video.

1281
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,000
I'm sure it did.
Yeah.

1282
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:56,060
And uh,
he's a preacher who were Kinda is 

1283
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:56,820
commenting and very devout Christian 
who's commenting on,

1284
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,910
you know,
the way Christianity has gone.

1285
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,650
And second book is why Christianity must
change or die,

1286
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,410
and it's really a poignant book for 
anybody interested in.

1287
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,090
He was super fascinating.
He was like,

1288
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,330
we're on the control business.

1289
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:10,310
This is all the control.
But he was like so upfront about it,

1290
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:14,270
like his whole entire career that he had
brutally honest.

1291
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:19,820
His first book goes through different 
passages and basically attacks the 

1292
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:20,970
fundamentalist position of Christianity 
and says,

1293
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:21,540
look,
you know,

1294
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,160
this doesn't make sense.
This was a book.

1295
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:24,440
It was a guidebook.
You know,

1296
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,060
there's lots of stuff that doesn't make 
a lot of sense in here anymore.

1297
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:28,290
You know,
let's go through this,

1298
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:33,291
let's get rid of this.
And then a second book philosophically 

1299
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:35,570
talks about how the evolution and 
Christianity needs to be in order for 

1300
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:36,870
that religion to survive.
And I think ultimately it will.

1301
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:39,840
I think it's happening like the fire and
brimstone that used to be,

1302
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:45,020
you know,
that Bosch paintings of people just 

1303
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:45,510
getting ripped apart.
And if you go to El Duomo in Florence,

1304
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:48,540
you look up at the ceiling and there's 
demons with these big,

1305
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:49,830
giant,
big giant.

1306
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,680
Wouldn't flaming staff shoving it in 
people's asses?

1307
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,170
It's like shoving one in,
some girl's pussy in.

1308
00:54:57,171 --> 00:54:59,160
You're in this church,
beautiful church and you're like,

1309
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:04,190
what the fuck is up here?
Like ill Duomo,

1310
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:11,770
Duomo.
It's the center church in the middle of 

1311
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:12,960
Florence.
Climb up this fucking bananas.

1312
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,880
Might have to see them.
I mean I've been there.

1313
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:16,620
Do they have.
They must have the photos.

1314
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,280
Yeah,
for sure.

1315
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,900
Sure.
So what is the story behind all that?

1316
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,210
Well,
I mean at that point,

1317
00:55:21,211 --> 00:55:26,211
I mean there were pushing the.
Well it was for sodomy and adultery and 

1318
00:55:26,211 --> 00:55:28,860
that was the crimes being punished,
but they would be punished by the Duomo.

1319
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,310
It's you.
I think it might be ill since it's Italy

1320
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:33,540
and then d,
u o,

1321
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:37,280
m o it's in Italy.
Those crazy Italian.

1322
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,950
But I mean just,
just not emad.

1323
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,150
Italians are so nuts,
man.

1324
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,290
I'm Italian.

1325
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:48,290
I grew up with.
But it's because there are so savage 

1326
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:48,470
that they're always riddled with guilt.
Yeah.

1327
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,250
They're just so fucking staring.
The leftover Romans,

1328
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:54,360
man,
that's real shit.

1329
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,540
Where's the photos of the dragons in the
assholes and shit.

1330
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,090
So it's going to be the interior of the 
dome.

1331
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:06,350
The dome need to see this so beautiful 
fucking building shit.

1332
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,070
Stunning.
I mean it's stunning.

1333
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,020
They need some dope ass architecture.
I did.

1334
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,030
They were on point.
Not Amazing.

1335
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,600
Isn't that amazing that if like if you 
look at like the Vatican,

1336
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,840
you know,
and looking like a lot of the shit from 

1337
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,160
like the like all the shit that Davinci 
painted,

1338
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:29,161
like the Sistine Chapel and stuff like 
no one does anything like that these 

1339
00:56:29,161 --> 00:56:29,560
days.
Some of the sculptures.

1340
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:34,561
I looked at some of the work by this 
artist named Bernini and I sat this one 

1341
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:35,710
and it was a,
it was a lady sitting on the pillows,

1342
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:40,711
the name a name a while Bernini actually
did the ones that were like Daphne and 

1343
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:45,500
Apollo and the rape of [inaudible] 70 
and just to look at how they.

1344
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,910
He was able to sculpt someone's fingers 
digging into someone's flesh.

1345
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,060
Like Haiti's is digging into perceptive.
He's into her side,

1346
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:55,870
like grabbing the side of it and you 
cannot believe that it's marble.

1347
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:59,590
I mean just the way that he makes it 
like flashy and lifelike.

1348
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:02,320
Canova did the same thing with this lady
reclining on a pillow,

1349
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:06,350
just sculpting sheets out of,
out of marble that looked like they're,

1350
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:11,460
you know,
you could fluff them in the breeze just 

1351
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:15,231
incredibly you.
It's all this stuff just passed on 

1352
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:18,121
through generation after generation of 
learning how to work with stone and 

1353
00:57:18,121 --> 00:57:18,660
carve and.
Yeah.

1354
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:21,190
Fuck yeah.
That'll never be duplicated.

1355
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:21,990
Yeah.
It's like no,

1356
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:27,050
just way too lazy carbon shit.
Fuck all the weaknesses and the marble 

1357
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:32,660
and envisioning what could come out of 
it.

1358
00:57:32,661 --> 00:57:37,661
But we'll do some crazy shit.
Like walk through the Amazon will do 

1359
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:37,900
some shit.

1360
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,690
Like I'm going to be the first guy like 
Douche bag.

1361
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:44,920
Do you know you can take a boat and it's
like a few hours you go all around.

1362
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:47,830
Well you know what's even crazier than 
walking through the Amazon.

1363
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,880
Have you seen the documentary?
Big River Man.

1364
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:53,770
The dude who swam the Amazon bods,
he swam the Amazon.

1365
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,360
Oh,
this one will be easy to bring.

1366
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,120
It goes.
It is a big river man.com.

1367
00:57:58,121 --> 00:58:01,410
And see that dude is not.
So he's from like a rounded die.

1368
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:04,720
Well he,
he does pretty much take 65 days,

1369
00:58:04,721 --> 00:58:06,730
right.
So it's this documentary of this guy and

1370
00:58:06,731 --> 00:58:11,731
he started swimming because he had this 
alcoholic father and his father would 

1371
00:58:11,731 --> 00:58:12,190
come home and try and beat him.
He's in eastern Europe,

1372
00:58:12,191 --> 00:58:13,690
try and beat them.
So you figure it out.

1373
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,310
They figured out if he went in the 
river,

1374
00:58:15,311 --> 00:58:20,311
his dad wouldn't follow them and so you 
just swim and his dad would chase him 

1375
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:20,311
along the riverside one.

1376
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:22,060
And so eventually he learned to be this 
stamina,

1377
00:58:22,061 --> 00:58:23,980
endurance swimmer,
but he got all fucked in the head,

1378
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:29,310
you know,
and so he goes out and he swam all of 

1379
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:32,311
the world's biggest rivers and so it 
goes out on the Amazon and I just 

1380
00:58:32,311 --> 00:58:36,081
thought it's happened to catch this late
night and I was just amazed and he 

1381
00:58:36,081 --> 00:58:38,731
doesn't do it.
Like a normal swimmer would like take 

1382
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:41,911
their protein and do that.
He's like getting them to throw bottles 

1383
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:42,510
of wine in the water and whiskey.
He comes off,

1384
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:46,120
he drinks two bottles of wine and he's 
not even in shape.

1385
00:58:46,121 --> 00:58:48,070
He's like,
he's kind of like Chubby,

1386
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,090
you know?
And,

1387
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,390
and he gets there,
but then around day 14,

1388
00:58:51,391 --> 00:58:53,620
you know all the parents,
he's drinking the water from the Amazon,

1389
00:58:53,621 --> 00:58:58,621
so all the sites get him.
He has an onboard doctor and he's like 

1390
00:58:58,621 --> 00:59:02,101
shocking himself with electroshock 
therapy to kill the parasites and he's 

1391
00:59:02,101 --> 00:59:04,540
like screaming with stuff and like 
batteries attached to them.

1392
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,480
It's not easy.
But then around the 40th day,

1393
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,610
the last you ever hear from him in the 
documentary,

1394
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:14,611
he goes,
I'm crossing into the fourth dimension 

1395
00:59:14,611 --> 00:59:16,930
now,
and he just fucking gone at that point,

1396
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,270
just gone.
And then say he'll like wake up early in

1397
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:22,310
the morning and swim away from the boat 
and they won't know where he is

1398
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,290
now.
Like pointing their light out and trying

1399
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:29,291
to find him.
They see him naked on some river bank 

1400
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:32,081
looking at driftwood just because he was
just fucked to begin with.

1401
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:38,771
Or was it all the parasites?
I think it's the parasites and just not 

1402
00:59:38,771 --> 00:59:38,800
taking care of himself.
Exhaustion.

1403
00:59:38,801 --> 00:59:41,380
He so sunburned.
He asked to wear this mask.

1404
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:44,930
He looks like silence of the lambs.
This mask covering his face.

1405
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,110
Holy Shit.
It's nutty.

1406
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:52,490
Big River man is the name of it.
Martin strehle I believe is his name 

1407
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:53,210
had.
It's funny.

1408
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:57,320
There's some motherfuckers.
It is a broad spectrum of human beings.

1409
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,140
It's broad.
Yeah.

1410
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:04,270
You know,
just when you think you've got people 

1411
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:05,810
completely figured out,
you'll find some new one online.

1412
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:10,870
You'll see some new shit.
I guess when he was swimming the 

1413
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:13,541
Yangtze,
it was so dirty and some of the 

1414
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:15,551
industrial areas that he had to have 
nightly blood transfusions from a nurse 

1415
01:00:15,551 --> 01:00:19,721
on the boat,
just new blood in blood out and he just 

1416
01:00:19,721 --> 01:00:19,760
kept swimming.

1417
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:23,260
Pictures of that swim or just insane.
You know,

1418
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,730
he wants to swim all of the biggest 
rivers of the world.

1419
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:31,840
What is it about people doing dangerous 
shit that they don't have to do?

1420
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,940
It's one thing that if you get thrown 
into the Amazon,

1421
01:00:34,941 --> 01:00:39,941
you have to figure out a way to swim,
to stay alive and make it to the shore 

1422
01:00:39,941 --> 01:00:41,510
and then get back to safety.
I survived in the woods.

1423
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,360
Yeah.
I started a fire with rocks.

1424
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:46,250
I know how to get back and I got back 
and I made it.

1425
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:51,251
That's an excellent story,
but when you thrust yourself into that 

1426
01:00:51,251 --> 01:00:51,770
situation,
like that's not a game,

1427
01:00:51,771 --> 01:00:53,230
that's a river.
Well,

1428
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:58,240
I think that is that it's not the 
survival instinct that is propagated 

1429
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,780
this species.
It's the instinct to reproduce and doing

1430
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:03,770
dangerous shit has always gotten checks 
and really that's what it is.

1431
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:04,090
Yeah.
I mean,

1432
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,880
how do you,
how do you account for chicks that like 

1433
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:10,250
getting hot air balloons and go across 
the world.

1434
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:12,620
How about this chick who's rolling her 
way?

1435
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:17,710
She's on a sail boat.
She's like 16 and she's sailing across 

1436
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:17,710
the ocean.
What's that about?

1437
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,420
She's a lesbian.
She's trying to get some.

1438
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,680
I don't know.
I mean I think that's some kind of,

1439
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,840
you know,
some kind of tapping into the same.

1440
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:28,870
Some of the same instincts.
I mean two lesbians trying to pick up 

1441
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:31,420
street chicks is just as creepy as dudes
trying to pick up straight checks.

1442
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,430
My girl certainly gets her.
That's her fair share.

1443
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:38,350
I was at the mailbox and I'm about 
Senate package and this,

1444
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,400
uh,
there's this lesbian lady and she's 

1445
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,911
like,
so obviously dykey just big and she's 

1446
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:45,911
got a mullet and it's,
it's,

1447
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:50,000
it's like the whole deal right now and 
she's got legs up going out of her way 

1448
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,090
and Eddie Bravo,
Falcon wristband.

1449
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:55,260
It's like a leather strap on arrest and 
the girl in front of her is a getting a 

1450
01:01:55,341 --> 01:01:56,600
package,
you know,

1451
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:57,990
and um,
uh,

1452
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,720
she dropped something.
She was like,

1453
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:00,710
Oh,
I'm sorry,

1454
01:02:00,711 --> 01:02:02,990
I'm so disorganized.
And the lesbian goes,

1455
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,640
don't apologize for being human.
I was like,

1456
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:10,310
oh,
it was so gross.

1457
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:13,670
I literally put my hand up to my mouth.
I went like,

1458
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,940
it was so like,
sleazy.

1459
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:19,380
Here's my card,
you know,

1460
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:20,470
it was so

1461
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,040
like low rent,
you know,

1462
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:25,380
traveling,
vacuum salesman,

1463
01:02:25,381 --> 01:02:26,670
trying to fuck somebody,
his wife,

1464
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,920
you know what I mean?
It was like so sad.

1465
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:34,430
Don't apologize for being late.
That must be what it sounds like.

1466
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:35,640
You know,
when,

1467
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,870
when dudes try to do it too,
I'm sure it is.

1468
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,680
Yes.
It's the same thing,

1469
01:02:40,681 --> 01:02:45,681
right?
When you hear a dude with a sleazy 

1470
01:02:45,681 --> 01:02:45,681
cheesy line,
you know,

1471
01:02:45,681 --> 01:02:45,681
and you're like,
oh,

1472
01:02:45,681 --> 01:02:47,760
you feel bad for that check or that 
could be your sister,

1473
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:48,860
that could be your daughter.
It's gonna.

1474
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:51,080
Listen to this moron.
No,

1475
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,790
I could always just give it to you right
here in my car.

1476
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,490
It's brutal.
Oh yeah.

1477
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:03,020
Could be someone's kid.
That perspective comes from having that 

1478
01:03:04,321 --> 01:03:05,850
perspective.
Jacks you.

1479
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,770
When you have children,
everything changes.

1480
01:03:07,771 --> 01:03:10,220
Porn becomes like a sad story,
you know,

1481
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,140
like,
Oh,

1482
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:15,120
poor girl getting fucked her.
That used to be somebody's baby.

1483
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:19,440
Somebody's little girl used to be a 
thumb now at some big giant Black Dick.

1484
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:20,730
Glug,
Glug,

1485
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:23,330
glug.
She's getting gagged,

1486
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,460
slapped in the face with it and went 
wow.

1487
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,500
Can enjoy it.
Not so fun.

1488
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,700
Changed it.
Changed the game.

1489
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,910
Have you been,
you've been Brian,

1490
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:36,090
have you ever been to set up a porn 
where a set of a porn?

1491
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:41,460
Uh,
just like my bedroom and stuff like 

1492
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,710
that.
Now it goes.

1493
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:44,520
Speaking of which,
um,

1494
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,360
play your friend,
your friend's closet.

1495
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,680
So this is not,
speaking of which I mean,

1496
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:53,710
you really,
this is not a romantic situation for 

1497
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:56,300
some porn.
I filmed no same Tripoli's naughty show.

1498
01:03:56,301 --> 01:04:01,301
This is a video that I'm and tell 
everybody they don't have to see it.

1499
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,010
It's funny enough as it is,
but if you want to see it,

1500
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,900
um,
what is the youtube address?

1501
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:10,310
Uh,
it's just type in a little esther on the

1502
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:12,470
street on a little esther on the street.
Now what this is,

1503
01:04:12,471 --> 01:04:16,400
is Brian's French is 20 to 22,
but she looks like she's 12.

1504
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:17,540
Yeah.
Twelve years old.

1505
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:18,730
Seriously.
She really looks like.

1506
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:20,380
And that's her whole thing.
And she,

1507
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:22,380
she was on Jimmy Kimmel.
She played Jimmy Kimmel's,

1508
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:27,570
sister,
sister on a Jimmy Kimmel and in one 

1509
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:27,570
episode or so.

1510
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:28,310
What is her name?
Uh,

1511
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,720
esther.
Esther.

1512
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,150
Yeah.
They,

1513
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:33,170
they'll go by little esther.
She's hilarious.

1514
01:04:33,171 --> 01:04:38,171
She's like a new up and coming comic.
I would say that she does a lot of 

1515
01:04:38,171 --> 01:04:38,660
comedy store stuff.
And Esther.

1516
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,100
I'm sorry,
what's your last name again?

1517
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,580
She goes by little esther.
Little Astro.

1518
01:04:42,581 --> 01:04:43,750
Yeah.
So you can find her.

1519
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,520
Her name is,
uh,

1520
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:45,920
is a mystery.
Well,

1521
01:04:45,921 --> 01:04:48,470
if you go on twitter,
it's twitter.com,

1522
01:04:48,471 --> 01:04:53,471
back slash L I l underscore,
I'll tweet it in a bit,

1523
01:04:53,481 --> 01:04:55,220
but uh,
yeah,

1524
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,060
it's called a little effort and here's 
a.

1525
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:02,630
So how do you spell esther?
Hold on EST h e r o [inaudible].

1526
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:11,230
I would have got that wrong.
So then I would have looked at it the 

1527
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:11,450
right way and be like,
that doesn't look right either.

1528
01:05:11,451 --> 01:05:12,930
Est He are,
they look stupid.

1529
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,210
All right,
whatever.

1530
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,020
Let's,
let's hear this.

1531
01:05:15,021 --> 01:05:16,190
It's funny,
she's on the street,

1532
01:05:16,191 --> 01:05:17,380
she's a,
she's a girl.

1533
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:17,980
Literally,
he looks

1534
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,000
like she's 12 years old and she's just 
walking up to strangers and she's saying

1535
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:22,990
that this is for her health class,
you know?

1536
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:23,530
Yeah.
All right.

1537
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,310
So here it goes.

1538
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:29,240
She's got questions.
She needs the answers.

1539
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:31,860
Interesting.
Um,

1540
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:33,190
so I'm just asking questions,
right?

1541
01:05:33,191 --> 01:05:36,060
Teen Health Project.
What is friends with benefits mean?

1542
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,300
Oh,
it's loading up.

1543
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:40,160
It was loaded.
Oh,

1544
01:05:40,161 --> 01:05:41,130
that's so gay.
Brian.

1545
01:05:41,131 --> 01:05:43,380
I can't believe you did that.
It was loaded up earlier,

1546
01:05:43,381 --> 01:05:44,140
but you know,
you,

1547
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,830
we went and did that.
Stopped it anyway,

1548
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:47,300
blah,
blah.

1549
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:47,560
Here.

1550
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:51,040
Say it again.

1551
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:55,790
They already heard that part,
God dammit.

1552
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:57,660
Anyway,
that's really funny.

1553
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,130
Yeah,
just go to online.

1554
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:02,070
We'll play it in the bay or load up 
while we're waiting.

1555
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,380
Let it load up.
Okay.

1556
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,990
Anyway,
she's 12 and she looks.

1557
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:08,550
She looks.
She looks like she's 12.

1558
01:06:08,551 --> 01:06:09,600
It's really funny.
Video.

1559
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,700
Yup.
From Sam Tripoli's.

1560
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:16,140
Knotty show.
And she asked dirty questions.

1561
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:17,820
Yeah,
a year and another joke.

1562
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:19,230
Right.
But it's good.

1563
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:24,290
It's a good joke.
It's very similar to that man show boy 

1564
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:25,320
concept kind of dirty kid.
Looks really young,

1565
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:30,330
but tonight,
but we're more wrong because it's a 

1566
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:31,380
girl,
but at least it's a really.

1567
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:34,830
She's really an adult as opposed to the.
Oh boy was a real little kid.

1568
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:35,820
Was it?
I thought it.

1569
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:36,810
I thought it wasn't.
I thought,

1570
01:06:36,811 --> 01:06:37,170
oh no,
no,

1571
01:06:37,171 --> 01:06:38,070
no.
I was a kid.

1572
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,710
It was like he was like 15 or something.
It was a boy.

1573
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,600
Right.
And he aged while the show was going on.

1574
01:06:42,601 --> 01:06:44,100
I didn't know that that became the man 
show,

1575
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,210
you know,
teenagers.

1576
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:50,520
I always got that kid mixed up with Andy
meant millinocket or whatever his name 

1577
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:54,531
is.
I don't even know who Andy millinocket 

1578
01:06:54,531 --> 01:06:56,650
says I know the name.
I've seen the name written in print and 

1579
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:56,880
it's like a cultural pop icon name.
Right.

1580
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,580
I know someone will say it and I don't 
know who it is.

1581
01:06:59,581 --> 01:07:01,160
I don't get it.
I've seen it 100 times.

1582
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:03,240
Was pretty funny.
Any comic?

1583
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:04,250
Yeah.
Well he's like,

1584
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:06,240
like a video guy that he didn't.
I don't even know,

1585
01:07:06,241 --> 01:07:07,530
like a youtube,
a youtube,

1586
01:07:07,531 --> 01:07:09,990
that kind of.
But he also has been in like stuff,

1587
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:15,020
you know,
movies and people don't get offended 

1588
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:15,020
when you say they don't know who they 
are and there's just so many,

1589
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:15,290
many people to know from MTV.

1590
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,100
I think Korea too much shit going on,
man.

1591
01:07:17,101 --> 01:07:18,960
I can't keep up with those God damn 
videos.

1592
01:07:18,961 --> 01:07:20,760
People are sending me.
I look at my twitter.

1593
01:07:20,761 --> 01:07:25,761
It's like if I,
if I wanted to just waste my entire 

1594
01:07:25,761 --> 01:07:25,761
life,
not waste but use up all my time,

1595
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:31,020
I would just go on my twitter and watch 
all the videos of people send me all 

1596
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,700
these fucked up crazy videos over and 
over and over and over again all day.

1597
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:34,440
Check this out.
Oh my God,

1598
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:36,930
have you ever seen this?
How is this guy still alive?

1599
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:39,690
Who Do it everyday?
Animal attacks,

1600
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,570
car wrecks,
motorcycle crash animal.

1601
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:45,630
All fucking day.
Dude.

1602
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:49,080
So much content out there.
It's impossible to watch it all.

1603
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,170
You're our minds.
You being reprogrammed.

1604
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:54,130
You sit in front of these fucking 
computers.

1605
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:58,410
You just inundated with crazy shit over 
and over again all day.

1606
01:07:58,411 --> 01:08:00,870
If you have time,
if you have time and your Dick Works,

1607
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,520
someone's going to say to you something 
fucked up,

1608
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:07,570
right?
Because if you have time and you're 

1609
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:07,570
young enough to be having fun in life,
you're gonna.

1610
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:08,830
Have some fun friends and if you have 
fun friends,

1611
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,020
they're going to see some fucked up 
shit.

1612
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,430
If they're going to see some fucked up 
shit,

1613
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:13,380
then I want you to see it too.
Right?

1614
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:15,090
Right.
If it tweaks,

1615
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,100
they're going to want to send

1616
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,990
it to you.
They want to.

1617
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,590
They're going to want to be the one that
shocks you.

1618
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,960
It's too much,
man.

1619
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,950
It is.
It's,

1620
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:27,990
you know,
every once in a while just reading a 

1621
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:27,990
book with actual pages,
you know,

1622
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:29,300
because I got the ipad thing and that.
I like that too,

1623
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:31,580
you know,
but it's sometimes comforting.

1624
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:36,840
Go back a page of letters.
You've tried this recently and this was 

1625
01:08:39,641 --> 01:08:42,330
a big thing that I do is a sensory 
deprivation tank.

1626
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:43,750
You just tried it for the first time,
right?

1627
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:45,100
Yep.
And what did you,

1628
01:08:45,101 --> 01:08:46,060
uh,
what'd you think about that?

1629
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:50,120
I think I sent this to you in an email,
but I likened it to the first time I had

1630
01:08:50,121 --> 01:08:55,121
sex,
like I could tell it was something rad 

1631
01:08:55,121 --> 01:08:56,240
and I knew I was going to dig it for the
most the rest of my life,

1632
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:00,350
but I was terrible at it.
Like just not quite good at it yet,

1633
01:09:00,351 --> 01:09:03,050
you know,
you have to really just relax your mind.

1634
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:06,050
And I was fidgeting with how comfortable
I was,

1635
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:09,890
but then I also was super tired when I,
when I was in there,

1636
01:09:09,891 --> 01:09:11,540
you know,
it was a long week and I didn't have it,

1637
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,550
you know,
available to me except for you know,

1638
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:18,551
kind of late in the evening.
And I wanted to make sure I got in so I 

1639
01:09:18,551 --> 01:09:21,941
started to fall asleep,
but it was just crazy consciousness and 

1640
01:09:21,941 --> 01:09:25,011
asleep,
sleep like I saw this window of where 

1641
01:09:25,011 --> 01:09:27,431
sleep was and I could visually see it,
I could see it with my eyes open and I 

1642
01:09:27,431 --> 01:09:31,691
could crawl in it and I was asleep and I
could crawl out of it and not be asleep 

1643
01:09:31,821 --> 01:09:36,410
and I was fully in control of,
of how it was going and that was pretty.

1644
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:41,740
That was pretty wild.
I mean what you're able to do with your 

1645
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:44,531
mind in that situation where you can't 
tell when your eyes are open and your 

1646
01:09:44,531 --> 01:09:46,820
eyes are closed and there's no feeling,
no sensation on your body.

1647
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,910
The amount of control I was able to 
exercise was amazing.

1648
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,030
It didn't find any kind of great lucid 
information out of it,

1649
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:56,150
but the experience was wild.
I mean,

1650
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:59,390
I've never been able to see those layers
because usually you just pass out.

1651
01:09:59,391 --> 01:10:01,610
You don't know when you fell asleep,
all of a sudden you're awake.

1652
01:10:01,611 --> 01:10:06,611
You remember that.
Then all of a sudden you're asleep and 

1653
01:10:06,611 --> 01:10:06,611
you wake up the next morning,
but this.

1654
01:10:06,611 --> 01:10:08,120
I was able to see the steps in between.

1655
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:11,520
He never realized how quiet it is until 
the power goes out in your house.

1656
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:17,110
You know when the power goes out in the 
neighborhood and the power's out 

1657
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:19,131
everywhere that you hear things go off 
and is that that dead silence that you 

1658
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:24,270
don't get any other way while the tank?
Is that times a million?

1659
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:26,250
Yup.
Tank is that with your body?

1660
01:10:26,251 --> 01:10:29,190
It shuts everything off everything.
It's.

1661
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:30,990
It's one of the things that I always 
talk about.

1662
01:10:30,991 --> 01:10:32,700
I talk about on this podcast all the 
time.

1663
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:35,510
I talk about in interviews all the time 
and the thing that I'm,

1664
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,990
oh,
I always say is that I'm.

1665
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:39,660
I'm always shocked that people don't do 
this.

1666
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:41,700
I'm always shocked that people don't 
know about this.

1667
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,450
I'm shocked that there's not one of 
these on every corner that people aren't

1668
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,330
having these things put in their house.
They have Jacuzzi to put in their house.

1669
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,720
Why don't you have an isolation tank?
Like do you not want to be happy?

1670
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,700
Do you not want to think?
You don't want to relax.

1671
01:10:53,701 --> 01:10:55,950
People are running like hell from their 
own thoughts.

1672
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,130
That's too dangerous.
Too much work,

1673
01:10:59,131 --> 01:11:00,150
man.
That's too much work.

1674
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:04,560
It's more work to to run for Miss Shit 
than it is to face your shit,

1675
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:06,960
you know,
and that there's no face in your shit.

1676
01:11:06,961 --> 01:11:08,620
Like facing your shit in that tank.
Yep.

1677
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:12,300
When you can't hide behind any bullshit,
when you're in there,

1678
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,190
you're,
you're,

1679
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:18,330
there's no distractions,
there's nothing you get right 

1680
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:19,410
immediately to the whatever it was 
fucking with you.

1681
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,780
Anything.
And then once you get good at that,

1682
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:24,580
then you become a I,
he become an astral traveler.

1683
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,790
You get in there and you,
you learn how to,

1684
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:30,390
how to really let go lock in quick.
I couldn't lock.

1685
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:32,670
I lock in within 15 minutes,
I'm gone.

1686
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,670
I settle in.
I it always.

1687
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:38,650
The thing is you always got to get your 
body to relax.

1688
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:43,950
There's so much carrying around and you 
don't realize how much tension you have 

1689
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:48,831
in you until you in a zero gravity 
environment and you realize you're 

1690
01:11:48,831 --> 01:11:51,681
holding yourself.
You're like pulling yourself in like 

1691
01:11:51,681 --> 01:11:52,080
your back muscles are pulled in your 
arms and pulling.

1692
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:53,610
You don't even realize you're doing 
this.

1693
01:11:53,611 --> 01:11:55,500
You're like fighting the world all the 
time,

1694
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:58,320
but when you get in there and then all 
that shit goes away.

1695
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:03,590
Then about 15 minutes and once the 
breathing stabilizes and I go that I'm 

1696
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:11,121
gone.
Then I'm often the land of wild 

1697
01:12:11,121 --> 01:12:13,440
hallucinations and fucking vivid dreams 
and lucid dreaming and flying and uh,

1698
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:18,950
communicating with entities and having 
things explained to you in gigantic 

1699
01:12:19,261 --> 01:12:24,261
three dimensional numbers from an alien 
planet that are rotating around you and 

1700
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:24,840
some big hall,
a scope that's like,

1701
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:29,940
like a,
like a hologram that shaped like the 

1702
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:32,061
planet earth.
I was watching the universe being 

1703
01:12:32,061 --> 01:12:34,401
explained to me in letters that were 
from another planet that we're spinning 

1704
01:12:34,401 --> 01:12:38,001
around that were three dimensional and 
it was all being orchestrated by these 

1705
01:12:38,001 --> 01:12:41,721
aliens.
And it made sense to me while I was 

1706
01:12:41,721 --> 01:12:43,761
watching it.
I was trying to figure out their code 

1707
01:12:43,761 --> 01:12:43,761
and their patterns.
This is okay.

1708
01:12:43,761 --> 01:12:44,880
So this is how the whole universe works.
It all works.

1709
01:12:44,881 --> 01:12:47,220
But this one thing.
Then everything goes into another thing.

1710
01:12:47,221 --> 01:12:49,260
And that goes deeper and deeper and 
deeper and deeper.

1711
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,050
That's how crazy the ticket.

1712
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:52,490
Yep.
Why is that?

1713
01:12:52,491 --> 01:12:53,570
Not Everywhere.
Well,

1714
01:12:53,571 --> 01:12:55,160
I mean there's other ways to get there,
right?

1715
01:12:56,050 --> 01:12:57,770
There ain't no other way to get there 
unless you're doing drugs.

1716
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:59,060
Right,
exactly.

1717
01:12:59,061 --> 01:13:00,560
That's kind of where I was leading to.
I mean,

1718
01:13:00,561 --> 01:13:03,080
but there's.
But even those are better in the tank.

1719
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:04,620
Yeah.

1720
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:08,170
Mushrooms in the tank or a totally 
different animal man.

1721
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,980
There's no distractions.
That mushroom gets to talk right to you.

1722
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,880
You know the weed in the tank,
the weeds talking right to you.

1723
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:21,090
There's no,
oh my ass is on the couch and the light 

1724
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:23,410
is hitting my eyes and the elbow touches
the seat arm.

1725
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,880
There's none of that.
There's no input.

1726
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:29,010
There's so many powerful weapons at our 
disposal that people are so scared of.

1727
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,630
I mean,
it's just crazy.

1728
01:13:30,631 --> 01:13:31,800
I mean,
the tank is one of them,

1729
01:13:31,801 --> 01:13:35,100
obviously a huge resource and it's easy.
It's just,

1730
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,230
you know,
you can't complain about anything.

1731
01:13:37,231 --> 01:13:39,360
But then there's other shamans for 
years.

1732
01:13:39,361 --> 01:13:44,361
I think the best way I've heard it 
described as as rad book or the cosmic 

1733
01:13:44,361 --> 01:13:47,871
serpent by Jeremy and and he says,
the Shamans goal is to lead you to the 

1734
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:51,510
realm of the spirit,
then allow you to defolk focalized.

1735
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,430
He talks about it like a stereo.
Graham,

1736
01:13:53,431 --> 01:13:56,010
you remember those three d images where 
you know,

1737
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:59,160
you relax your eyes and they,
the three d would pop out.

1738
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:04,370
He's like,
that's what you're doing when you're in 

1739
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:06,141
that kind of shamanistic experiences,
your [inaudible] your body and then 

1740
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:08,970
allowing communication to come through 
and hit.

1741
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,010
But his theories are pretty amazing.

1742
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,230
I mean it's just these conversations 
are.

1743
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,060
There's people right now that are 
listening.

1744
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:21,090
Okay.
And there's two groups of people that 

1745
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,000
obviously there's more than two,
but when it comes to this subject,

1746
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:27,001
there's people who've had psychedelic 
experiences and people who have no 

1747
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:30,631
fucking idea what we're talking about.
Like literally you think we're talking 

1748
01:14:30,631 --> 01:14:31,770
about hippy fairy dust,
you know,

1749
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:33,150
like this is what it sounds like.
You're,

1750
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,060
wait a minute,
what are you doing?

1751
01:14:34,061 --> 01:14:36,400
You're tuning in to what he had to it 
in,

1752
01:14:36,401 --> 01:14:38,080
into what do you.
Yeah,

1753
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:40,540
you're tuning into Santa Claus,
what's going on,

1754
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:45,541
right.
Like there's like there's even 

1755
01:14:45,541 --> 01:14:47,341
intelligent scientists that we'll have 
conversations and if you bring up any 

1756
01:14:47,341 --> 01:14:52,321
sort of psychedelic or any sort of 
psychedelic compound or altered states 

1757
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:52,720
of consciousness,
they just shut off on you.

1758
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:55,360
They just immediately discredit 
everything you're saying.

1759
01:14:55,361 --> 01:15:00,361
Well,
you're just talking about getting high 

1760
01:15:00,361 --> 01:15:00,361
and muscles.

1761
01:15:00,361 --> 01:15:00,361
Well,
you know,

1762
01:15:00,361 --> 01:15:02,140
nice little box that they can and they 
toss it away,

1763
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,690
but if they've done mushrooms,
they'll go,

1764
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:08,410
oh yeah,
they'll look at you and go,

1765
01:15:08,411 --> 01:15:09,310
yeah,
it might be that.

1766
01:15:09,311 --> 01:15:14,311
Yeah,
it might be that I've talked to like 

1767
01:15:14,311 --> 01:15:14,311
some serious,
serious fucking scientists,

1768
01:15:14,311 --> 01:15:18,631
men and guys who have phds and guys who 
work at universities teaching schools 

1769
01:15:20,261 --> 01:15:22,600
and any teaching physics courses and 
shit.

1770
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:27,610
I've talked to them about psychedelics 
and add some fascinating conversations 

1771
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:30,010
where people who are way smarter than 
me,

1772
01:15:30,011 --> 01:15:31,960
way more educated than me,
way,

1773
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:37,230
way more experienced in the ways of the 
world and they've had a bunch of 

1774
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:38,070
psychedelic experiences and you know,
they'll tell you like,

1775
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:39,930
who knows what that is?
Yeah.

1776
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:45,060
Who the fuck knows what that.
That might be a billion different 

1777
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,461
things.
This is a pretty cool theory by Jeremy 

1778
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:47,461
and rob,
and I'll give you the cliff notes here,

1779
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:51,121
so for discussion sake,
but he went down to the Ios garrow 

1780
01:15:51,121 --> 01:15:55,171
Charmaine's down in the jungle and I 
took the Iowasca with them and he was 

1781
01:15:55,391 --> 01:15:57,580
just an anthropologist just for people 
who don't know.

1782
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:01,420
Let's explain what Iowasca is.
IOWASCA is two different plants.

1783
01:16:01,421 --> 01:16:06,421
There's the actual dimethyltryptamine 
active plant that is part of a vine and 

1784
01:16:07,151 --> 01:16:10,280
then somehow out of the 80,000
species in the Amazon,

1785
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:11,860
they figured out things.
It's other than that,

1786
01:16:11,861 --> 01:16:14,080
yeah,
there's this other leaf that they needed

1787
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:17,590
to combine with it to actually make it 
work and a Mao inhibitor.

1788
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:23,040
So they combine this and they make it 
into a tea and it's been part of the 

1789
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:23,040
traditional religious ceremonies down 
there.

1790
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:27,630
Yeah.
So what does dmt stuff is is a chemical 

1791
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:28,840
that it's the most potent psychedelic 
drug known to man,

1792
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,480
but it exists in a bunch of different 
plants,

1793
01:16:31,481 --> 01:16:34,090
but you can't eat it because when you 
eat it,

1794
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:39,120
it exists in so many different things.
I guess your body has some protection 

1795
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:39,850
for because if you eat grass,
grass has dmt in it,

1796
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,140
well there's a thing that your stomach 
makes called Mano aiming oxidation.

1797
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:48,170
That's Mao.
So these guys figured out how to mix an 

1798
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:51,151
Mao inhibitor that kills the Mao in 
their system with this dmt so that they 

1799
01:16:51,151 --> 01:16:55,861
can take it orally and you talk to 
owners when they interviewed the guys 

1800
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,910
and they asked them how they figured 
this shit out thousands of years ago,

1801
01:16:57,911 --> 01:16:59,890
by the way,
they said the plants,

1802
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,840
that's how they say about all the 
medicines that they,

1803
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,570
the plants.
So Jeremy,

1804
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:07,150
he took that and he was like,
how could this be true?

1805
01:17:07,151 --> 01:17:08,790
He's like,
science discredits it,

1806
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,010
but they prove it time and

1807
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,560
time again.
They pick the shit that works.

1808
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,450
And then modern Pharma goes down there 
and say,

1809
01:17:14,451 --> 01:17:15,500
Hey,
what does this do?

1810
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:18,230
And they know the answer.
So how do they know the answers?

1811
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,390
You know?
And so the theory is that this all comes

1812
01:17:20,391 --> 01:17:22,370
from your brain,
your brain projects,

1813
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:24,410
this stuff when you take 
dimethyltryptamine.

1814
01:17:24,411 --> 01:17:27,470
But he has a different theory and his 
theory goes that,

1815
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:32,710
you know,
in all of these cultures you see a lot 

1816
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:35,231
of serpents when you're underneath these
visions and these serpents are often 

1817
01:17:35,231 --> 01:17:36,860
intertwined and you can see this written
in in rock paintings,

1818
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:39,050
in aboriginal Australia and all over the
place.

1819
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:44,410
The vision of the serpent,
he calls it the cosmic serpent is 

1820
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,231
everywhere.
And what he's saying is that's actually 

1821
01:17:47,231 --> 01:17:48,740
a vision of person's DNA,
of DNA in general,

1822
01:17:48,741 --> 01:17:53,741
not just the person,
but the DNA of life and that you're 

1823
01:17:53,741 --> 01:17:54,200
actually,
when you're in that level,

1824
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:58,490
you're communicating on a 
microbiological level with DNA,

1825
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,410
which is connects everything.

1826
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:05,410
It's kind of like the Navi avatar 
principle where everything is connected 

1827
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:09,701
by the universal language of DNA and the
default realization of the IOWASCA 

1828
01:18:09,701 --> 01:18:12,680
allows you to communicate with the DNA 
so that the plants talk to you,

1829
01:18:12,681 --> 01:18:17,681
that there's visions and wisdom from 
everything that comes and the synthesis 

1830
01:18:17,681 --> 01:18:18,040
is able to get.
I mean,

1831
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,740
there's actually DNA emits and one of 
the ways you say they communicate is DNA

1832
01:18:21,741 --> 01:18:24,440
emits actual light.
It emits photons.

1833
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:28,340
DNA itself will do that.
It's too dim and it's too small when you

1834
01:18:28,341 --> 01:18:33,341
isolate DNA by itself,
but it'll emit a certain amount of 

1835
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:33,341
photons.
So you know the,

1836
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:38,141
all of these theories that you know,
your beings of light and whatever and 

1837
01:18:38,141 --> 01:18:38,141
everything's all.
Everything is light.

1838
01:18:38,141 --> 01:18:38,750
Oh,
sounds like you said,

1839
01:18:38,751 --> 01:18:41,300
like hippie stuff or whatever.
But it's cross culturally.

1840
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,950
People say this.
Well when you do Dmt,

1841
01:18:43,951 --> 01:18:44,860
that's what you see.
Two,

1842
01:18:44,861 --> 01:18:46,500
you see beings that are may not have 
light.

1843
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:47,510
Right?
Exactly.

1844
01:18:47,511 --> 01:18:51,350
And he's saying that's the DNA.
The DNA is the substance of life.

1845
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:53,930
It's interconnected substance of life.
And that's,

1846
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:56,390
that's basically the collective 
unconscious,

1847
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:58,160
you know,
and that's how all different life

1848
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,480
I see where you're doing,
you're just trying to fuck.

1849
01:19:04,481 --> 01:19:06,030
And there's always the cynic those steps
in.

1850
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:06,880
Yeah,
that's good.

1851
01:19:06,881 --> 01:19:08,090
You've got,
this is what you got.

1852
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:13,091
You've got chemicals interacting with 
your brain and you'd go loopy for a few 

1853
01:19:13,091 --> 01:19:16,760
hours while your body tries to normalize
the poison you've put in your system.

1854
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:17,220
Yeah,
yeah,

1855
01:19:17,221 --> 01:19:18,340
yeah.
What you are.

1856
01:19:18,341 --> 01:19:20,170
Okay,
it's just another religion,

1857
01:19:20,171 --> 01:19:25,171
man.
You're just believe in some more wacky 

1858
01:19:25,171 --> 01:19:27,331
shit.
And all that one ever tells me is that 

1859
01:19:27,331 --> 01:19:27,850
dude hasn't done dmt.
That's all it tells me.

1860
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:31,600
If you're talking shit about doing DMT,
for sure you haven't done it.

1861
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:32,980
Because once you do it you go,

1862
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:37,190
oh,
oh Whoa,

1863
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:38,040
whoa.
Really,

1864
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,470
really changes the game.

1865
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:44,670
And these guys have been doing it for 
thousands of years and people go,

1866
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:47,950
what we'll do through so's book smart 
man a bit.

1867
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:50,970
Have TVS or cars didn't have paved 
roads.

1868
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,430
Because if you are doing dmt all the 
time,

1869
01:19:53,431 --> 01:19:58,431
you wouldn't give a fuck about tvs.
TV Ain't shit compared to being able to 

1870
01:19:58,431 --> 01:20:00,260
communicate with the afterlife.
You fuck you.

1871
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:01,590
You know what's funny?
I can fish.

1872
01:20:01,591 --> 01:20:04,020
I'll go get a fish.
It takes me an hour.

1873
01:20:04,021 --> 01:20:05,460
I cook,
I know I have food,

1874
01:20:05,461 --> 01:20:06,870
I'm done.
I'll go do some more.

1875
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:07,770
Tay,
right?

1876
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,450
The ios cares,
they call,

1877
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:12,390
they call the Iowaska,
but the television of the forest,

1878
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:14,160
that's what they call it.
Like that is,

1879
01:20:14,161 --> 01:20:16,710
that is where they go to the interesting
point.

1880
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:19,800
Are there any television?
They brought some Iowasca back from,

1881
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,000
uh,
from Brazil.

1882
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:23,670
I believe this was in the fifties.
And they,

1883
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,670
when they first recognize it as a 
psychoactive substance,

1884
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,880
they were going to call it telepathy 
because it allowed group think and 

1885
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:37,761
allowed to let pathy,
like they were going to pat it as 

1886
01:20:37,761 --> 01:20:37,920
telepathy,
but they didn't realize that the,

1887
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:42,921
um,
one of the active compounds in it had 

1888
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:45,681
already been identified and that was 
harming and because harming had already 

1889
01:20:45,681 --> 01:20:48,390
been identified because of the rules of 
scientific nomenclature,

1890
01:20:48,391 --> 01:20:50,550
like the thing they were naming had 
already been named.

1891
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:55,910
So they couldn't call it telepathy,
but that's what they were going to call 

1892
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:55,910
it.
They were going to call it telepathy.

1893
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:56,190
Been like,
Whoa,

1894
01:20:56,191 --> 01:21:01,191
that's the active ingredient or 
something that allows you to have 

1895
01:21:01,191 --> 01:21:01,191
telepathy.
This is really like,

1896
01:21:01,191 --> 01:21:01,890
scientists are fucking writing this 
down.

1897
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:03,300
Right?
That's nutty shit man.

1898
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:06,750
It sounds so woo.
Deepak Chopra,

1899
01:21:06,751 --> 01:21:10,530
yoga beads bullshit.
It sounds so fucking dumb to me.

1900
01:21:10,531 --> 01:21:15,531
It sounds dumb,
but I know it's real because I've done 

1901
01:21:15,531 --> 01:21:17,931
it like that's how crazy dmt is.
An IOWASCA and mushrooms and all these 

1902
01:21:17,931 --> 01:21:22,140
things that people just automatically 
label as silly automat.

1903
01:21:22,141 --> 01:21:26,100
These are life changing reset button 
pressing motherfuckers.

1904
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,480
And everybody's like,
oh,

1905
01:21:27,481 --> 01:21:29,130
what are you doing?
Mushrooms,

1906
01:21:29,131 --> 01:21:30,900
man.
Here's an honest question.

1907
01:21:30,901 --> 01:21:35,901
Do you talk about DMT everyday?
Is there days that you don't talk about 

1908
01:21:35,901 --> 01:21:35,901
it?
Not at all.

1909
01:21:35,901 --> 01:21:38,850
So amazing that like it's just flooding.
Can't talk about anything every day.

1910
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,440
Man.
I Bet I think about it every day.

1911
01:21:40,441 --> 01:21:45,320
There's always a moment where I'm like 
in the shower by myself and go,

1912
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:50,330
Oh yeah,
so you don't think that's kind of crazy 

1913
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:53,281
that you're not crazy.
It's just like if you were picked up by 

1914
01:21:53,281 --> 01:21:53,430
God and take on a magical mystery tour 
for three hours,

1915
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:58,670
the spaceship above fucking Pluto view 
would be remembering that shit all the 

1916
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:02,391
time because it was the most extreme 
experience a human being could ever 

1917
01:22:02,391 --> 01:22:03,030
possibly have felt that like in drugs 
where I'm like,

1918
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:05,240
this is the most amazing thing in the 
whole entire group,

1919
01:22:05,241 --> 01:22:06,720
but I don't think.
Not like that.

1920
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:09,690
You don't like that.
It's not.

1921
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:11,190
This was the most amazing thing in the 
world.

1922
01:22:11,191 --> 01:22:13,080
It's not like that at all.
It's this,

1923
01:22:13,081 --> 01:22:15,420
that this is even possible,
is impossible.

1924
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20,600
That this exists is mind blowing,
that this reality seems really than the 

1925
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,300
reality that I live in every day.

1926
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:26,510
The fact that there's something that 
feels like it's communicating with you 

1927
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:29,481
and it's giving you a message that 
you're connected to everything and that 

1928
01:22:29,481 --> 01:22:33,501
it's a gigantic illusion created by your
biology to keep you alive and to make 

1929
01:22:33,501 --> 01:22:36,240
you sustain this other world that exists
in your dream consciousness.

1930
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:39,630
I mean they,
they communicate this shit to you and it

1931
01:22:39,631 --> 01:22:44,631
makes sense and whatever it is is sees 
right through you and communicates only 

1932
01:22:45,691 --> 01:22:49,530
with love and is showing you impossible 
to believe.

1933
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,340
Images and visuals and at the end of it,
when it's all over,

1934
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:56,970
you're changed forever.
Like you can never get to go back on,

1935
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,620
go back.
You want to,

1936
01:22:58,621 --> 01:23:03,621
but you couldn't anyway,
but you've got to make sure that 

1937
01:23:03,621 --> 01:23:05,320
whatever you get out of that,
you can still talk to people.

1938
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:08,630
That's another much of anything.
Like,

1939
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:10,450
I don't want to lose your grip.
Yeah,

1940
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,820
you don't want to get slippery,
slippery.

1941
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:14,700
You could get.
If you know,

1942
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:19,710
there's a guy that I know that's a 
tattoo artist that's done dmt like 100 

1943
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:20,830
times and um,
I,

1944
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:25,480
I have hung out with this dude and he 
did Eddie's arm know Eddie's a sleeve.

1945
01:23:25,890 --> 01:23:27,910
I don't want to say his name just in 
case he doesn't want people knowing.

1946
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:32,860
Anyway,
dude is got this fucking sniper stare.

1947
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,230
He's got this look in his eyes,
man.

1948
01:23:35,231 --> 01:23:38,920
Like he's just been over there just a 
few too many times.

1949
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:42,460
Like he can't ever quite step back into 
the real world.

1950
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:45,430
Like every corner he turns around,
there's fucking DMT.

1951
01:23:45,431 --> 01:23:47,440
Elves stared at him from behind the 
counter.

1952
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,600
Like he's just been there too many 
times.

1953
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:51,760
Man.
He's had some very interesting.

1954
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:55,060
He doesn't talk about it.
That's a weird thing I think when you,

1955
01:23:55,061 --> 01:23:56,710
when you,
when he does talk about it,

1956
01:23:56,711 --> 01:23:59,680
but he doesn't go into depth like me,
like I'm just yapping about it because I

1957
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:02,290
haven't done it in years.
So it's still fresh in my mind.

1958
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:04,990
It,
it start off like I'm talking about it a

1959
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:08,920
lot and then you start peeing your pants
and then we can talk about it.

1960
01:24:08,921 --> 01:24:13,921
You start seeing it again,
like little flashbacks will pop into 

1961
01:24:13,921 --> 01:24:14,380
your head of things that happened,
not flashbacks,

1962
01:24:14,381 --> 01:24:16,690
like you were like you can't see or 
you're hallucinating,

1963
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:18,400
but just like,
oh yeah.

1964
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:18,940
Oh,
okay.

1965
01:24:18,941 --> 01:24:19,870
That happened.
Oh yeah.

1966
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:20,800
Oh yeah.
Just,

1967
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:22,570
just.
It makes you think about it again.

1968
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:24,550
There was one experience that,
uh,

1969
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:27,040
that I had at the traditional shaman out
in,

1970
01:24:27,041 --> 01:24:29,320
uh,
out in the desert here in the US.

1971
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:32,830
And she took me out.
She took me out a girl Shama yeah,

1972
01:24:32,831 --> 01:24:35,720
female.
She's hardcore and uh,

1973
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,990
and so with the music start.
So,

1974
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:39,720
but anyways,
I,

1975
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:43,300
you know,
I fasted for traditional preparation and

1976
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:45,130
I drank,
drank,

1977
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,570
drank of substance.
I think it was,

1978
01:24:46,571 --> 01:24:47,390
um,
you know,

1979
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:50,830
some kind of mushroom and other 
traditional plant based substance.

1980
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:55,570
And that what I got from that has 
totally changed my life forever.

1981
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,690
At that point I was able to lift from my
body,

1982
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:01,270
lift from it,
look down and realize,

1983
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:03,640
Oh wow,
this is just the vessel,

1984
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:05,020
you know,
it's useful.

1985
01:25:05,021 --> 01:25:06,970
It's wonderful.
It allows me to flow through this world,

1986
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:09,700
but it's not the end of.
It's not the beal,

1987
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:11,350
you know,
like there's a separation.

1988
01:25:11,351 --> 01:25:16,351
There is a distinction between body and 
spirit and from then the fear of death 

1989
01:25:16,351 --> 01:25:18,460
evaporated for me and it's just.
It would just be a shame.

1990
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:20,020
Like I certainly don't want to die.
I love life.

1991
01:25:20,021 --> 01:25:23,350
Life is fucking rat,
but the fear of it is gone.

1992
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:25,430
There was just a loose nation,
man.

1993
01:25:25,431 --> 01:25:30,431
You were on mushrooms.
You're hanging out with a hot shaman 

1994
01:25:30,431 --> 01:25:33,250
girl trying to get some pussy.
You got a little carried up in the 

1995
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:33,380
moment.
You went a little barry manilow.

1996
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:36,050
She's just.
Just put him on your shoulders,

1997
01:25:36,051 --> 01:25:37,660
man.
He could have been January shoulder.

1998
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:39,740
Everything of that.
Do you ever.

1999
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:42,020
Do you know the book of the,
of the book,

2000
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:43,970
Sacred Mushroom in the cross?
You ever heard that story?

2001
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:47,180
I've heard a little bit about John Marco
Allegro,

2002
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:50,300
who was the one of the head scholars of 
the Dead Sea Scrolls.

2003
01:25:50,301 --> 01:25:55,301
He was in charged of deciphering it.
Spent 14 years working on the oldest 

2004
01:25:55,301 --> 01:25:58,550
version of the Bible by far and what he 
decided after 14 years,

2005
01:25:58,551 --> 01:26:03,551
he wrote a book about it that the entire
Christian religion was a gigantic 

2006
01:26:03,551 --> 01:26:07,091
misunderstanding.
What it was initially all about was 

2007
01:26:07,091 --> 01:26:09,080
psychedelic mushrooms and fertility 
rituals and he said,

2008
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:14,081
this is what the whole Christian 
religion was initially all about and 

2009
01:26:14,081 --> 01:26:14,330
like,
you know,

2010
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,160
has this fucking book dedicated to it.

2011
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,260
I don't know.
I can't follow it.

2012
01:26:18,261 --> 01:26:19,400
I don't understand,
you know,

2013
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:21,290
ancient languages.
I have no knowledge,

2014
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:26,440
but just the fact that this guy was 
really well respected scholar and it 

2015
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:27,170
came to these conclusions.
I mean,

2016
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:31,070
of course they were doing drugs.
The drugs were around.

2017
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:33,410
Mushrooms have been around for thousands
and thousands of years.

2018
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:35,840
What were the first ones to figure out?
You can eat it.

2019
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:38,390
People back then ate everything they 
could write.

2020
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:39,830
They had everything.
They had a truck.

2021
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:44,890
The reason why we know shit's poisonous 
is because due to eight it and died and 

2022
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:44,890
then they said,
all right,

2023
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:44,890
he ate that.
He'd died.

2024
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:46,340
Don't eat that.
You read that.

2025
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:49,000
You try eating that because if this is,
there's a lot of this shit around it.

2026
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:50,180
This is edible.
It's good,

2027
01:26:50,181 --> 01:26:51,230
it's good.
The apples are good.

2028
01:26:51,231 --> 01:26:56,231
Let's eat the apples.
That mean that's how they figured out 

2029
01:26:56,231 --> 01:26:56,231
how to do things.

2030
01:26:56,231 --> 01:26:56,231
They ate everything,
Bro.

2031
01:26:56,231 --> 01:26:56,930
They it all.
They knew what was good,

2032
01:26:56,931 --> 01:27:01,931
what was bad,
and if mushrooms are around and they 

2033
01:27:01,931 --> 01:27:01,931
were people were eating them and if 
people were eating them,

2034
01:27:01,931 --> 01:27:04,160
they were seeing God and if they were 
seeing God,

2035
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:05,990
they didn't want anybody else in on the 
action.

2036
01:27:05,991 --> 01:27:10,991
So what do they do?
They hid all their fucking knowledge 

2037
01:27:10,991 --> 01:27:13,481
about these mushrooms and these rituals 
and they put it in stories and they put 

2038
01:27:13,481 --> 01:27:17,501
it in fables and parables and they just 
twisted it all up so it was just a 

2039
01:27:17,501 --> 01:27:17,780
little bit different.
Yeah.

2040
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:19,430
Fascinating.
That's the fucking.

2041
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:22,040
The forbidden fruit is a mushroom man.
That's what it is.

2042
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:24,650
I mean there's,
there's an ancient fresco in France,

2043
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:27,050
there's this ancient.
I'm a painting rather,

2044
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,120
and it's a on a,
on this wall.

2045
01:27:29,121 --> 01:27:34,121
It's from fucking thousands of years ago
and it's Adam and eve with a mushroom 

2046
01:27:34,121 --> 01:27:36,140
tree is Adam and eve with mushroom caps 
all around them.

2047
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:38,870
I mean it is the fucking forbidden fruit

2048
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,420
and it's been squashed because if you 
take that,

2049
01:27:41,421 --> 01:27:43,830
that's a direct link I feel to God,
you know,

2050
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:48,230
I'm a both a spiritual person in a kind 
of a deistic believer in the,

2051
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,750
in the universal God for us.
But you take,

2052
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:55,890
so you take away mushrooms and then you 
insert people and people get to absolve 

2053
01:27:55,890 --> 01:27:56,330
you of your sins.
It gives them power.

2054
01:27:56,331 --> 01:27:58,310
You build them giant structures,
you know,

2055
01:27:58,311 --> 01:28:01,340
they get the hat,
we'll money power and if you look at the

2056
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:03,770
history of the Catholic Church,
women as well,

2057
01:28:03,771 --> 01:28:08,771
especially in the Middle Ages and the 
renaissance going through there and so 

2058
01:28:08,771 --> 01:28:10,970
they have inserted themselves and then 
removed the other mechanism to get there

2059
01:28:10,971 --> 01:28:15,971
directly.
So they become the intermediaries at a 

2060
01:28:15,971 --> 01:28:15,971
certain point.
I wonder,

2061
01:28:15,971 --> 01:28:17,640
I mean how much of that is true because 
there's a lot of speculation about,

2062
01:28:17,641 --> 01:28:18,200
you know,
we're,

2063
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,670
where they lost the way and what it was 
really all about.

2064
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:22,920
I'm wondering how much they let the 
common people know about it.

2065
01:28:22,921 --> 01:28:24,240
Even back then,
you know,

2066
01:28:24,241 --> 01:28:25,810
maybe it was something that,
you know,

2067
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:30,830
the,
the elite found out about it and they 

2068
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:30,830
tried to protect the information even 
from the common folk,

2069
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:34,110
but also might have been a question of 
climate change to terence.

2070
01:28:34,111 --> 01:28:37,350
Mckenna's had some ideas about that and 
he thought that,

2071
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:39,690
um,
with the global climate change,

2072
01:28:39,691 --> 01:28:40,130
which is,
you know,

2073
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:45,200
very cyclical happens all the time.
A lot of times the climate will be 

2074
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:48,981
inhospitable for mushrooms that changes.
So instead of getting mushrooms all the 

2075
01:28:48,981 --> 01:28:49,140
time,
now they can't get them anymore.

2076
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:54,410
And so then the culture completely 
changes and becomes more of an alcohol 

2077
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,970
based culture starts off.
They start using preserved,

2078
01:28:57,050 --> 01:29:02,050
uh,
mushrooms in honey because we know 

2079
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:02,160
they've been preserving things in honey 
for and thousands of years.

2080
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:07,430
And then you deal with fermentation 
because honey can become a psychoactive 

2081
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:08,610
substance on its own.
It could become mead.

2082
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:10,890
When it becomes fermented,
it becomes like an alcohol.

2083
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:13,080
And so then they go into an alcohol 
culture.

2084
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:18,081
And then before you know it,
the mushroom ideas are gone all the 

2085
01:29:18,081 --> 01:29:18,081
love.
And you know,

2086
01:29:18,081 --> 01:29:22,761
all the,
your fellow man that Shit's out the 

2087
01:29:22,761 --> 01:29:22,980
window and now you know,
everyone's just drunk and raping.

2088
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:26,880
You know,
it's interesting.

2089
01:29:26,910 --> 01:29:31,910
It's fascinating shit man.
What you always got to wonder like how 

2090
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:34,020
did we get to be who we are now?
Like what was it like?

2091
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:39,080
Could you imagine if you could go to 
like 1400 BC and just go hang around 

2092
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:44,420
England and see what the fuck was going 
on in France and see how people were 

2093
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:44,420
living in Europe.
You know?

2094
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:46,200
How trippy would that be?
Man,

2095
01:29:46,201 --> 01:29:48,150
that'd be crazy.
Woo.

2096
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:52,260
That would be the strangest fucking 
thing to be able to go back in time.

2097
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:55,980
Even just in like an invisible,
impenetrable capsule.

2098
01:29:56,070 --> 01:30:01,070
Like you could just stand there like in 
an invisible phone booth in the middle 

2099
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:01,440
of a town,
you know?

2100
01:30:01,441 --> 01:30:04,350
And you get to watch and they can't walk
through the phone booth.

2101
01:30:04,351 --> 01:30:06,150
It looks like a tree.
They can't touch it.

2102
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,240
You know?
I've always,

2103
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:09,910
I've been fascinated by that moment 
before battle,

2104
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,050
you know,
where you know,

2105
01:30:11,051 --> 01:30:16,051
you just have,
you have like an ax or you choose 

2106
01:30:16,051 --> 01:30:18,631
between an ax,
a morning star and a sword and you're 

2107
01:30:18,631 --> 01:30:18,631
like,
what am I going to use?

2108
01:30:18,631 --> 01:30:20,380
It's gonna maybe make me survive,
you know,

2109
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:25,381
like how good is my armor?
Not as good as that dude's but I'm a 

2110
01:30:25,381 --> 01:30:26,740
rocket anyways.
And like just feel that.

2111
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:31,940
I mean mma gets an approximation of that
and I think why people love it so much 

2112
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:35,560
because it's the closest we got,
but it pales in comparison to that,

2113
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:40,910
you know,
to that moment you're with all of the 

2114
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:42,931
people in your country and perhaps the 
horde that's coming is going to rape 

2115
01:30:42,931 --> 01:30:42,931
your girl,
you know,

2116
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:45,010
kill your children,
put them into slavery,

2117
01:30:45,011 --> 01:30:48,970
smash their head on and you got it.
You just got to fucking hold the ground,

2118
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:51,280
you know,
like how is that?

2119
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:54,460
We don't even know what that's about.
I have no idea.

2120
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:56,410
No,
and they did that forever.

2121
01:30:56,530 --> 01:31:01,530
Forever.
I mean that was such a part of the 

2122
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:01,530
human,
you know,

2123
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:05,550
birthright.
But how much of that shit is still in 

2124
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:05,550
our genes and how do you shut that shit 
of it?

2125
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:10,140
All right.
The human hardware is so retro still 

2126
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,320
goes on now like any war,
you're doing the same thing.

2127
01:31:11,321 --> 01:31:15,100
Like what kind of missiles is this guy 
goes different now.

2128
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,140
It's totally impersonal.
You know?

2129
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:20,060
It's so impersonal.
Know with the call of duty,

2130
01:31:20,061 --> 01:31:25,061
it's pretty great.
Soldiers were saying just said call of 

2131
01:31:25,061 --> 01:31:27,290
duty.
Well two wars are going overseas.

2132
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:30,190
What that means like call of duty.
That means it's all ground game.

2133
01:31:30,191 --> 01:31:35,191
That game is pretty much ground game 
going into or explosions and stuff like 

2134
01:31:35,191 --> 01:31:35,830
that.
Still going on for is

2135
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:37,370
going on and you know what else is going
on?

2136
01:31:37,371 --> 01:31:42,371
Drones.
Drones are allowed to go into places 

2137
01:31:42,371 --> 01:31:42,920
we're not even really at war with.
Like in Pakistan,

2138
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,230
we're not really supposed to be a war in
Pakistan,

2139
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:50,440
but we got spaceships that are working 
on remote control from Nevada.

2140
01:31:52,050 --> 01:31:57,050
They're remote controlling them from 
Nevada and jacking dudes in Pakistan 

2141
01:31:57,381 --> 01:31:58,310
from the air.
It

2142
01:31:58,310 --> 01:31:59,610
probably have iphone apps with

2143
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,050
controlling.
Just tilt it man.

2144
01:32:02,051 --> 01:32:04,190
You can destroy that person by just 
hitting.

2145
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:06,330
Do it.
It's like that movie.

2146
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:11,350
Do you remember that movie where the 
dude got really good at that video game 

2147
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:12,320
and then the aliens came and recruited 
him?

2148
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:13,820
Yeah,
I remember that Shit.

2149
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:18,410
I remember that Shit.
Star Star fighter starfighter.

2150
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:19,850
Was that it?
Starfighter.

2151
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:21,610
I just remember because his name was 
Rogan.

2152
01:32:21,650 --> 01:32:25,100
His name was Alex Rogan and you know 
dude,

2153
01:32:25,101 --> 01:32:27,740
I mean they're doing that with kids that
get really good at video games,

2154
01:32:27,741 --> 01:32:27,950
man.

2155
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:29,530
Yeah.
Kids get real good at video games.

2156
01:32:29,970 --> 01:32:34,970
You guys are awesome.
Already hasn't been score and then 

2157
01:32:34,970 --> 01:32:38,160
people burst in your dorm.
Pneumatics on the army has a video game 

2158
01:32:38,171 --> 01:32:40,450
that's tracked so they can track the top
guys.

2159
01:32:40,451 --> 01:32:43,340
I bet those top guys get knocks on the 
door of once in a while.

2160
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:48,590
Would you like a million dollars?
You imagine that you would like to add 

2161
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:48,590
80

2162
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:48,590
pounds and you're in your underwear.
You like,

2163
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:49,540
um.
I don't like killing things for real.

2164
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,480
It just make to play your game.
Can I go back to playing your game?

2165
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:55,150
You put some poor little 13 year old,
like flat boat years.

2166
01:32:55,151 --> 01:32:57,640
You can join us.
You can play that game for a living.

2167
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:00,890
What do you think?
Bell tell anything you want.

2168
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,850
Take some poor fucking kid.
It was just awesome.

2169
01:33:03,851 --> 01:33:05,620
At the army game.
Yeah.

2170
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:08,410
It's scary to remove that personal side 
to killing.

2171
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:11,350
I mean it's just a totally different 
paradigm.

2172
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:14,800
When we were talking before the show 
about these guys that had been caught in

2173
01:33:14,801 --> 01:33:19,801
Afghanistan that are US soldiers that 
had been killing civilians and taking 

2174
01:33:19,801 --> 01:33:22,921
home little trophies.
They'd been playing like a game just 

2175
01:33:22,921 --> 01:33:24,910
jacking people and killing people.
Just they get to use to killing people,

2176
01:33:24,911 --> 01:33:25,800
man.
To,

2177
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,950
to used to killing people and to use to 
being in a place where everyone presents

2178
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:31,520
you and they don't want you to be there.

2179
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:34,210
You know?
I always,

2180
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:37,420
for the longest time I always would look
at,

2181
01:33:37,421 --> 01:33:39,490
at,
at like politicians and go,

2182
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:44,670
how much say do they really have?
How much state is a president really 

2183
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:45,400
have and what the fuck is going on over 
there?

2184
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:48,040
Or is he just a dude with a job just 
like all of us.

2185
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,260
Is it just all bullshit once you get in 
there,

2186
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:52,490
you know,
and I used to look at Bush and when,

2187
01:33:52,491 --> 01:33:56,470
when Bush was in Iraq and I say,
how is this motherfucker responsible for

2188
01:33:56,471 --> 01:34:01,471
all these people dying?
Is he responsible for all this talk 

2189
01:34:01,471 --> 01:34:04,831
about weapons of mass destruction or is 
he just some dude who's got to do this 

2190
01:34:04,831 --> 01:34:08,071
job?
And I remember when he was standing in 

2191
01:34:08,071 --> 01:34:08,760
front of those people and that dude took
off his shoes and through madam.

2192
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:10,490
Yeah,
I remember that Shit.

2193
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:15,760
I remember that and he ducked and then 
to do through it again and he ducked 

2194
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,290
again and he had a little half smile on 
his face and I'm like,

2195
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:18,670
that guy's just a spokesman.

2196
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,440
Yeah,
that's what I got out of that.

2197
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:21,580
I looked at that.
I'm like,

2198
01:34:21,581 --> 01:34:26,581
that is just a dude with a very 
difficult job that's not all that bright

2199
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:31,060
and has some ideals and got stuck in 
this situation and yeah,

2200
01:34:31,061 --> 01:34:36,061
he's got to say we're going to war,
but there's a machine behind that 

2201
01:34:36,061 --> 01:34:36,061
motherfucker.
He's not running.

2202
01:34:36,061 --> 01:34:39,070
Shit I'm looking at is duck in those 
shoes smiling?

2203
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:40,240
I'm like,
that guy is not.

2204
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:43,480
He doesn't have a care in the world.
He's not worrying about what happened in

2205
01:34:43,481 --> 01:34:44,150
Iraq.
He's.

2206
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:44,820
He says,
no,

2207
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:47,580
he's just an employee.
Perhaps it's not as responsibility,

2208
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:48,250
really,
is it?

2209
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:53,950
I don't know.
I think Alex Jones would have a theory 

2210
01:34:53,950 --> 01:34:57,511
on that.
That was my favorite part of the whole 

2211
01:34:57,511 --> 01:34:57,511
Bush administration was in that through 
through the shoes.

2212
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,740
It was the first time I liked him.
The first time I liked Bush,

2213
01:35:00,741 --> 01:35:01,430
I would get angry.

2214
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:06,430
I'm like,
this mother fucker's just bake it a 

2215
01:35:06,430 --> 01:35:06,430
board.
It's all bullshit now.

2216
01:35:06,430 --> 01:35:06,430
I thought about.
I'm like,

2217
01:35:06,430 --> 01:35:06,800
that guy probably gets like four hours 
sleep a night.

2218
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:08,980
What would I be saying if I was speaking
all these people,

2219
01:35:08,981 --> 01:35:11,360
I'd be making up words too.
I'd be stumbling.

2220
01:35:11,361 --> 01:35:13,400
I'd fuck my words up at it.
Everybody fucks up.

2221
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:18,550
You know.
Obama said something about there being 

2222
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:18,550
48 states.
I mean,

2223
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:18,860
he fucked up the states when he was 
running.

2224
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:20,780
You know,
people fuckings up all the time.

2225
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:22,130
You're not thinking you're tired all the
time.

2226
01:35:22,131 --> 01:35:24,260
You're on this campaign trail.
They don't.

2227
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:27,500
He's not running shit.
I learned like Bush.

2228
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:29,450
No,
I mean I think he's probably right.

2229
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,490
It's probably not a bad guy.
Okay.

2230
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,560
Everybody's like use the gym and he's 
double.

2231
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:38,990
I bet they believe that you're really a 
president until they get in there.

2232
01:35:39,230 --> 01:35:39,680
You know?

2233
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:41,490
I think once you get in there,
you,

2234
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:45,980
they open up these doors and you get to 
see the gears of the universe run.

2235
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:49,400
You get to see the gears of our whole 
system and the fucking.

2236
01:35:49,401 --> 01:35:50,600
Well,
if we stopped the war,

2237
01:35:50,601 --> 01:35:53,840
we don't have the oil and we needed to 
do in society is going to fall apart and

2238
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:55,480
we're getting to a point of 
overpopulation.

2239
01:35:55,670 --> 01:36:00,670
That's why you need to feed them in 
camps and we have to make sure that if 

2240
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:02,861
something goes down,
we have enough caskets and whoa now 

2241
01:36:02,861 --> 01:36:04,250
about you cutting taxes.
Oh fuck.

2242
01:36:04,251 --> 01:36:05,450
All that.
Fuck all that.

2243
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:06,530
Fuck all that.
Exactly.

2244
01:36:06,531 --> 01:36:07,430
We don't need some money,
dude.

2245
01:36:07,431 --> 01:36:08,900
We're going to need some money or some 
shit going on.

2246
01:36:08,901 --> 01:36:10,250
We've got to come up with an alternative
fuel.

2247
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:15,340
We have exactly two years worth of fuel 
left and then people start eating 

2248
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:15,340
people.

2249
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:18,940
Okay,
what the fuck happens when you get in 

2250
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:18,940
there,
man?

2251
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:20,150
Yeah.
I was a big,

2252
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,430
big support.
I was a big Obama Fan.

2253
01:36:22,431 --> 01:36:23,030
I thought,
you know,

2254
01:36:23,031 --> 01:36:24,050
maybe I don't.
I'm not.

2255
01:36:24,051 --> 01:36:26,330
I'm a libertarian so I'm not Republican 
or Democrat,

2256
01:36:26,331 --> 01:36:29,470
but I thought this dude is smart.
He can hoop.

2257
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:34,600
He's got a good family.
It looks like he'll get in there and 

2258
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:34,730
play a little basketball.
Hey,

2259
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:36,440
you say that I,
I appreciate it.

2260
01:36:36,441 --> 01:36:37,940
I saw him play pool.
They'll go,

2261
01:36:37,941 --> 01:36:41,630
this guy's got gotta look,
Bama can get out.

2262
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,860
You mean for balls on the table?
Obama might get out on man played halo.

2263
01:36:45,861 --> 01:36:48,740
Reach with him.
He's a regular dude.

2264
01:36:48,741 --> 01:36:53,741
That's what I want.
I don't want something fucking child 

2265
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:56,150
blood sucking dragon like Dick Cheney.
Dick Cheney can't play pool.

2266
01:36:56,151 --> 01:37:01,151
He's too busy killing people.
You think Dick Cheney everland had to 

2267
01:37:01,151 --> 01:37:01,151
play basketball.
No,

2268
01:37:01,151 --> 01:37:04,550
he's heart explodes when he tries to tie
his shoes at 150 heart attacks,

2269
01:37:04,551 --> 01:37:07,370
you know he ain't playing shit with you 
and he's got no sense of humor.

2270
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:08,890
You know,
I,

2271
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I could recognize him and relate to him 
more than anyone that has ever been 

2272
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:14,390
president before.
I was like,

2273
01:37:14,391 --> 01:37:19,391
well,
here's a guy who was only a few years 

2274
01:37:19,391 --> 01:37:19,391
older than me,
and he seems like a normal dude.

2275
01:37:19,391 --> 01:37:19,850
You know,
like Kanye West.

2276
01:37:19,851 --> 01:37:22,280
He calls him a jackass and like,
yeah,

2277
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:24,560
fuck yeah,
this is his wife.

2278
01:37:24,561 --> 01:37:25,280
It's like,
oh yeah.

2279
01:37:25,281 --> 01:37:27,260
He kissed his wife.
That bullshit.

2280
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,990
Quail.
That was carrie.

2281
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:32,220
Oh,
all of them.

2282
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:37,221
All of them.
My favorite swarmy Douche bag busted 

2283
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:41,560
you.
You fucking fake all of them,

2284
01:37:41,561 --> 01:37:42,620
man.
It's like you can't.

2285
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:45,920
It's like,
it's impossible to be honest.

2286
01:37:45,921 --> 01:37:48,650
It's impossible to do it.
They won't let you get in.

2287
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:53,860
You got to be full of shit to get in.
I thought Obama was the first guy that 

2288
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:53,860
wasn't full of Shit.
I was like,

2289
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:58,841
what is.
He seems like soda can take a chance 

2290
01:37:58,841 --> 01:37:58,841
with.

2291
01:37:58,841 --> 01:37:58,841
I was,
I was backing.

2292
01:37:58,841 --> 01:37:59,380
I think you can do anything.
I think you get in.

2293
01:37:59,390 --> 01:38:02,580
It's just a stalemated yeah.
You get in.

2294
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:05,190
It's just like,
well fuck you.

2295
01:38:05,191 --> 01:38:10,191
No lobbyists and fucking congress and 
this and that and layers and red tape 

2296
01:38:11,161 --> 01:38:15,030
and chaos and war,
and then they just tell her when heroin,

2297
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:20,180
heroin,
heroin coming in by the fucking 

2298
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:20,180
boatload.
What's the heroin doing?

2299
01:38:20,210 --> 01:38:22,260
It's just slightly.
Afghans need to make a profit.

2300
01:38:22,261 --> 01:38:24,620
Otherwise support this war.
You know?

2301
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:26,240
We were talking about that on the Alex 
Jones show.

2302
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:29,580
We were talking about that before the 
show that there was a Geraldo Rivera was

2303
01:38:29,581 --> 01:38:32,490
in Afghanistan talking to this fucking 
soldier,

2304
01:38:32,491 --> 01:38:36,870
this guy who has a family who is 
supposed to be defending his country and

2305
01:38:36,871 --> 01:38:41,871
meanwhile where is he?
He's in the poppy fields protecting the 

2306
01:38:41,871 --> 01:38:45,351
poppy fields for the afghany farmers 
because in order for the Afghan farmers 

2307
01:38:45,351 --> 01:38:48,930
to support the fact that we're over in 
Afghanistan dropping bombs on your moms,

2308
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:54,320
we have to get this guy's approval and 
we have to allow them to keep producing 

2309
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:59,211
their illegal crop of heroin.
So we have American soldiers that are 

2310
01:38:59,211 --> 01:39:03,351
guarding Afghanistan heroin so that we 
can go over there and blow shit up.

2311
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:09,210
God Damn.
What do you do if your Obama,

2312
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:10,200
what do you do?
Fuck.

2313
01:39:10,201 --> 01:39:12,510
You get into how you gonna fix that.
It's tough,

2314
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:17,840
but as you know,
I think they figured out that his 

2315
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:18,430
approval ratings were dropping as the 
economy was tightening up and so they're

2316
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:18,790
like,
ah,

2317
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:23,810
fuck it.
Let's just put some more money on the 

2318
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:23,810
system,
push the ball up,

2319
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:25,470
and then it's working.
If I thought that heroin was helping the

2320
01:39:25,471 --> 01:39:27,090
economy,
I would say so that heroin,

2321
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:31,230
who the fuck is buying heroin retards?
You know,

2322
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:33,990
why is oil still like in,
at least in California?

2323
01:39:33,991 --> 01:39:35,820
Most states right now,
still cheap.

2324
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:39,030
Cheaper than it was like five years ago.
And you know what you mean?

2325
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:42,960
When Bush was leaving office then they 
had a fucking a grab,

2326
01:39:42,961 --> 01:39:47,961
but don't you say,
why don't you think it should be like 

2327
01:39:47,961 --> 01:39:50,661
ridiculously high,
especially after that spill and stuff 

2328
01:39:50,661 --> 01:39:50,661
like that.

2329
01:39:50,661 --> 01:39:54,700
Well,
did you just realize or just here 

2330
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:56,481
rather,
they underestimated Iraqis oil reserve 

2331
01:39:56,481 --> 01:39:59,061
by 25 percent.
There's 25 percent more oil in Iraq and 

2332
01:39:59,061 --> 01:40:00,300
they thought there was a.
oh Shit,

2333
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:01,990
oh shit,
I'm gonna.

2334
01:40:01,991 --> 01:40:05,430
Get that quote that son fuck a Va.
You know,

2335
01:40:05,431 --> 01:40:07,710
listen man,
who the fuck knows?

2336
01:40:07,830 --> 01:40:12,830
I think it was,
I think they just jacked up all the 

2337
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:14,010
prices that they can pay for new plaza 
on top of the all the fucking oil.

2338
01:40:14,060 --> 01:40:16,380
You got to be gotten to like the gas 
station.

2339
01:40:16,381 --> 01:40:19,710
There's like nice plasma tvs and 
everything like that and like how does,

2340
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:21,330
where does this come from?
Oh yeah,

2341
01:40:21,331 --> 01:40:23,580
$5 a gallon last last year.
You know,

2342
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,870
I'm,
I'm wondering who actually,

2343
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:26,580
how that works.
I think.

2344
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:31,640
I think actually how it works is the.
I mean they're all in bed together 

2345
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,750
obviously,
but I believe it's the distributors that

2346
01:40:33,751 --> 01:40:36,360
set the price and then these oil 
companies,

2347
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:41,361
like there's a place up the street,
it's owned by these hindus that I go to 

2348
01:40:41,361 --> 01:40:42,720
and they have like the ohm on the door.
I'm like,

2349
01:40:42,721 --> 01:40:45,060
this is the oddest place ever.
They sell weed pipes.

2350
01:40:45,061 --> 01:40:47,970
They're there.
So we pipes and incense at the counter.

2351
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:52,170
Like this is the oddest place ever.
Like you guys sell petrochemicals.

2352
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:54,280
You sell,
you know the real problem,

2353
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:59,370
the reason why we're in war,
that you know the reason why we pollute 

2354
01:40:59,370 --> 01:40:59,370
and it's all coming out of this hole 
right here.

2355
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:04,420
And then you get the oam at the door.
So I don't think it's them setting the 

2356
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:08,461
price of the plasmas.
I think it's the companies that sell it 

2357
01:41:08,461 --> 01:41:08,461
to them,

2358
01:41:08,461 --> 01:41:09,830
you know,
it's all for free market speculation,

2359
01:41:09,831 --> 01:41:10,750
handles a lot of that.
I mean,

2360
01:41:10,751 --> 01:41:13,670
when oil price was dropping there as big
deflationary pressures,

2361
01:41:13,671 --> 01:41:15,440
at the same time,
gold prices were dropping,

2362
01:41:15,441 --> 01:41:17,330
things were priced because nobody had 
any money.

2363
01:41:17,331 --> 01:41:19,400
The speculators weren't able to buy the 
gold,

2364
01:41:19,670 --> 01:41:21,800
they were pulling their assets back out 
into cash,

2365
01:41:21,801 --> 01:41:26,801
et cetera.
But now things are a little bit looser 

2366
01:41:26,801 --> 01:41:27,080
and these commodities have value.
They're more worried about inflation now

2367
01:41:27,110 --> 01:41:28,640
because obama's push it,
you know,

2368
01:41:28,641 --> 01:41:33,641
just shoving money into the system.
So in an inflationary time then these 

2369
01:41:34,041 --> 01:41:36,710
commodities have value.
So now we're seeing oil rising.

2370
01:41:36,711 --> 01:41:37,610
We're seeing gold bush.

2371
01:41:38,730 --> 01:41:43,730
I would,
there was one big jump where it went up 

2372
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:43,730
to like five bucks a gallon.
What was the cause of that?

2373
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:44,030
I,
you know,

2374
01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:47,410
I think at that point it was the massive
inflationary concern,

2375
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:48,470
you know,
that there was,

2376
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:54,120
that money was goIng to lose its value 
and that caused the oil to go up in 

2377
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:54,630
price at the.
Yeah.

2378
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,170
When it,
when it goes up a barrel,

2379
01:41:56,171 --> 01:41:57,580
does anybody know?
You don't know either.

2380
01:41:57,581 --> 01:41:58,400
Do you?
Brian has no idea.

2381
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:00,350
Yeah,
it's fine.

2382
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:02,130
I'll tell you.
It's dangerous.

2383
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:07,150
It's ninja set the price in Japan on 
friendly dolphins and there's certain,

2384
01:42:07,151 --> 01:42:12,151
there's certain supply and demand 
factors involved in the oil but as well 

2385
01:42:12,151 --> 01:42:13,690
specifically,
but on a macro level,

2386
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,880
I mean it's all about generally 
inflation.

2387
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:20,920
It just seemed very suspicious to me 
that it was the end of the bush 

2388
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,651
administration and administration that 
was clearly under the influence of big 

2389
01:42:23,651 --> 01:42:24,740
oil and then at the very end of the 
administration,

2390
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:25,640
everything just gets

2391
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,700
delta twist to pay his tab.
You know?

2392
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:31,280
It was true,
it was true red line.

2393
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:36,300
They were going to red line as much 
money out of the system as they could 

2394
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:37,900
until the new administration came into 
play on how much,

2395
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:42,930
how much control does the president or 
the administration really have and how 

2396
01:42:42,930 --> 01:42:44,540
that kind of stuff works.
Do they have any at all?

2397
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:49,560
It's all gotta be set up.
There's no way they're going let some 

2398
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:51,991
new dude come in every four years and 
just rerun shit like why would we do 

2399
01:42:51,991 --> 01:42:52,900
that?
We know the career guys,

2400
01:42:52,901 --> 01:42:54,310
the very top of the heap.
They've already.

2401
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:56,820
We got this.
We got no.

2402
01:42:57,350 --> 01:43:01,280
Well opec supposedly sets how much the 
available reserves there are and kind of

2403
01:43:01,281 --> 01:43:02,310
does that,
but how much is it?

2404
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,730
You know,
all of that is speculation now who knows

2405
01:43:04,731 --> 01:43:06,710
how much they know and what they're 
doing,

2406
01:43:06,711 --> 01:43:11,711
but it's.
It's an interesting game with a lot of 

2407
01:43:11,711 --> 01:43:11,711
money at stake when you have that much 
money at stake,

2408
01:43:11,711 --> 01:43:14,870
you could be buck sure that people are 
trying to figure out a way to fuck it.

2409
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:20,420
You know?
It's pretty amazing what it's done now 

2410
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:20,420
because if it wasn't for oil,
there would be no plastic.

2411
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:22,020
There'd be no computers,
it'd be no nothing.

2412
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:24,000
You know,
all the shit that we make today.

2413
01:43:24,030 --> 01:43:25,980
No flashlights,
no flashlights.

2414
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:29,310
Especially flashlight is actually made 
out of oil.

2415
01:43:29,790 --> 01:43:33,300
This shit has to come out of the ground 
as oil before you can fuck it.

2416
01:43:33,470 --> 01:43:34,790
Yeah.
Mostly mineral oil,

2417
01:43:34,791 --> 01:43:35,500
food grade,
mineral,

2418
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:38,000
a primary component

2419
01:43:38,190 --> 01:43:40,620
and food grade mineral oil comes out of 
the ground,

2420
01:43:40,621 --> 01:43:41,340
right?
Just like,

2421
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:42,210
just like,
well

2422
01:43:42,930 --> 01:43:44,580
why?
Where does it mean?

2423
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:46,170
Doesn't it all come from?
Yeah.

2424
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:51,200
I think it actually might come from it.
Probably know

2425
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,800
that doesn't come from fish.
Can you make a flashlight?

2426
01:43:54,801 --> 01:43:56,180
That official.
Al will be nasty.

2427
01:43:56,780 --> 01:44:00,430
That would be more realistic.
Dirty fucking deep flashlight.

2428
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:03,530
Maybe some dudes just missed stinky 
pussy.

2429
01:44:03,531 --> 01:44:08,531
All the only time they got laid as by 
slots and just drunk pigs and that's 

2430
01:44:08,531 --> 01:44:11,680
what gives me a hard on.
There's a good mood.

2431
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:17,200
There's a product that came out actually
called the vulva and what they've done,

2432
01:44:17,201 --> 01:44:21,190
they sell it for 40 bucks,
gagging already 40 bucks and it's like a

2433
01:44:21,191 --> 01:44:24,040
little perfume vial that supposedly 
smells like pussy.

2434
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:30,490
So obviously being in the business that 
we ordered some fast around a smell and 

2435
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:37,400
it doesn't quite get there,
but what it kind of smells like is like 

2436
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:37,400
a cat.
No,

2437
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:39,190
no,
it's way closer to that.

2438
01:44:39,191 --> 01:44:41,710
It's like post condoms,
sweaty sex,

2439
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:49,890
sweat and rubber has like this.
Like this.

2440
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:59,980
Oh,
why would anybody want to sell stinky 

2441
01:44:59,980 --> 01:44:59,980
pussy smell?
I dunno.

2442
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:04,760
We used to send ours with,
with like knife to spread on your 

2443
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:04,770
vanilla scent.
But now all flashlights come on.

2444
01:45:04,771 --> 01:45:09,771
So I always wonder how much fart porn is
just for show how much of dudes who are 

2445
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:15,050
mostly definitely girls who were foreign
and dudes miles and they're beating off 

2446
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:15,050
and shit.
What,

2447
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:19,250
what is that?
Is that for show or is that just fire 

2448
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:19,800
porn really over the deep end.
What is that?

2449
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:20,970
What is that?

2450
01:45:21,310 --> 01:45:22,020
Uh,
you know,

2451
01:45:22,021 --> 01:45:27,021
I,
I think with all these fetishes out 

2452
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:27,021
there likes it for sure.
At least familiar for sure.

2453
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:27,860
He's one guy out there,
loves every,

2454
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:29,880
you know what I think it is.
I think all of these fetishes,

2455
01:45:29,881 --> 01:45:32,940
whether their feet or whether it's shit,
I think someone's mommy was like,

2456
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:36,240
that's disgusting.
Don't you ever fart like bottle and they

2457
01:45:36,241 --> 01:45:41,241
just hammer them with this repression 
and this repression gets all twisted up 

2458
01:45:41,241 --> 01:45:45,380
and then all of a sudden all they want 
to do to get a boner is barred on 

2459
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:46,250
somebody because they've been told by 
their mothers so many times.

2460
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:48,380
Parting is disgusting.
Don't ever fart.

2461
01:45:48,630 --> 01:45:50,970
And I think the same with feet,
like hide your dirty feet,

2462
01:45:50,971 --> 01:45:55,971
you're dirty feet day,
they think blah blah blah and like 

2463
01:45:55,971 --> 01:45:56,200
really like kind of victorian,
you know,

2464
01:45:56,210 --> 01:45:58,260
parents are doing.
Then all of a sudden all they want to do

2465
01:45:58,261 --> 01:46:00,390
is see someone getting jerked off by 
girls feet.

2466
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:02,880
So what's your I,
you know,

2467
01:46:02,881 --> 01:46:06,480
I don't have one really bright girl.
I don't know.

2468
01:46:06,481 --> 01:46:07,560
My beautiful girlfriend friend.

2469
01:46:07,770 --> 01:46:11,520
Yeah.
What's your spine?

2470
01:46:11,910 --> 01:46:13,680
I have a lot of fetishes.
Really?

2471
01:46:13,681 --> 01:46:14,280
Yeah,
totally.

2472
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:16,580
Definitely boobs.
That's not a.

2473
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:20,220
So it's called being a dude now.
Every guys in the boobs,

2474
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:21,300
I'm not really.
No,

2475
01:46:21,330 --> 01:46:23,880
you don't remember,
but my mom really a bug guy,

2476
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:27,240
but it's definitely more.
I appreciate,

2477
01:46:27,270 --> 01:46:29,340
I appreciate what they do to the 
feminine form.

2478
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:34,341
Like I can aesthetically value them,
but as a sexual object very low on the 

2479
01:46:34,341 --> 01:46:34,341
list.
Yeah,

2480
01:46:34,341 --> 01:46:35,730
I agree.
Well,

2481
01:46:35,731 --> 01:46:38,800
I don't say they're low on the list,
but they do not compare it to the ass.

2482
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:44,080
This is critical.
It's very important that trigger girl 

2483
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,270
can have a tremendous ass and really be 
like an a cop and she's hot as fuck.

2484
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,740
You know?
It doesn't matter.

2485
01:46:46,741 --> 01:46:48,360
You look at the ash like,
god damn.

2486
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:49,980
Yeah,
but girl with big tits

2487
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,260
and a really flat ass.
It's just like if the bud had nipples,

2488
01:46:53,261 --> 01:46:56,040
I would agree.
If the fns had nipples,

2489
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:57,510
I would agree.
Could you imagine though,

2490
01:46:57,511 --> 01:47:00,150
if an asset,
if that'd be the nipples,

2491
01:47:00,151 --> 01:47:01,950
you would agree that you don't want to 
fly one.

2492
01:47:04,190 --> 01:47:05,090
No,
I'm just saying for fed is,

2493
01:47:05,091 --> 01:47:07,450
is if you combined boob and asked,
that would be like the best.

2494
01:47:07,790 --> 01:47:08,910
Do a mashup.
Yeah.

2495
01:47:08,911 --> 01:47:12,770
I want to finish refinish mashup.
The remix.

2496
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:13,300
It.
