1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,440
Very nice to meet you.
Good to meet you.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,333
How are you?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,880
Boom.
And we're live.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,920
Uh,
so just to give everybody a good way to

5
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:14,630
start this.
You have a book.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,030
A book is called the desert in the sea
and you have one of the most disturbing

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,760
and craziest stories I think I ever
read.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,200
You were kidnapped by Somali pirates and
you were held hostage for more than two

9
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:31,034
years.
Yeah.

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,910
What the fuck was that like and what
does it feel like to be a free man now?

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,930
After all that?
Are you kidding?

12
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:41,870
It feels great in America.
Wandering around the valley,

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,690
the valley where I was born and raised,
by the way,

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,590
are you?
Yeah,

15
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,020
this is the first time I've been back in
the valley for a couple of years now.

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,183
What,
what,

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,030
what happened and how,
how did it happen?

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,600
Long Story.
Um,

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,550
so I went to Somalia in the first place
to write a book,

20
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,660
a very different books about Somali
pirates right in front of me.

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,440
And um,
I.

22
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,920
So I'm a journalist.
I was working in Berlin at the time and

23
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:12,921
I had followed a very long trial of 10
Somali pirates in Germany in Hamburg for

24
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,620
about a year,
all of 2011.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,160
And before that I had already thought
about going to Somalia because the

26
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:23,190
pirate story,
it was interesting and all sorts of ways

27
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:25,200
that I thought other writers weren't
getting to.

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,220
And I had met another journalist to a
documentary maker named Ashwin Romano

29
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,510
who also wanted to go to Somalia for his
own project.

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,300
And uh,
so we talked about going for a long time

31
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:40,320
and by the end of 2011,
I'm in the middle of the trial.

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,760
We all are.
Plans came together and we wound up

33
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:49,761
going in January of 2012 and we had
about 10 days of good research.

34
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,220
Um,
we both got pretty good material and we

35
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:55,620
were in a part of Somalia where other
journalists had gone.

36
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,050
So we weren't doing something that was
totally off the map,

37
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:58,884
you know.
Um,

38
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,940
and uh,
on the 10th day Ashwin flew off to

39
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,070
Mogadishu and,
um,

40
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,170
I went with him to the airport,
we saw him off.

41
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,860
And it was on the way back from the
airport that um,

42
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,590
a truck was waiting for our car and the
truck,

43
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,820
which is actually a technical,
so a battle wagon with a candidate in

44
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,340
the back,
stopped us,

45
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,350
aim the cannon through the windshield,
overpowered my Gourd and 12 guys with

46
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:30,270
Kalashnikovs pulled me out of the car.
So I was gonna put me in another car and

47
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:32,760
we drove off.
So from that moment on,

48
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:33,594
I was a captive

49
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,100
Jesus Christ.
And so they were obviously trying to get

50
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:40,070
some hostage.

51
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,810
Yeah,
no,

52
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,170
it was about money and I think they were
hoping for both of us,

53
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:46,870
by the way,
I'm Ashwin feels very lucky that he

54
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:49,300
didn't get captured.
So they had planned this.

55
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,980
Yeah.
And they were probably waiting for our

56
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:54,700
car earlier in the morning when it was
just Ashwyn's good luck that we took a

57
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:58,240
different route to the airport.
How much money were they asking for the.

58
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,070
Well,
so the first they asked for me was

59
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,710
$20,000,000,
but that was after the first week.

60
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,830
So I went for a week without having a
phone call home.

61
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,820
Um,
and in that period seals rescued two

62
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:12,010
other hostages from another part of
central Somalia,

63
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,930
including Jessica Buchanan in an
American and I think nine Somali guards

64
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:24,421
died in that raid and they had some Klan
relationship to some of the guys holding

65
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,350
me.
And so the guy's holding me were very

66
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:30,280
upset and I think that's why they asked
for $20 million and help more

67
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,350
importantly held onto that demand for so
long,

68
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:34,210
what they held onto it for almost a
year,

69
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,850
that specific number,
they wouldn't budge.

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,010
So they were in negotiations.
Yeah,

71
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,780
there were negotiations,
but they were,

72
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,360
you know,
phoning negotiations in some sense

73
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:46,240
because the Somalis weren't,
weren't really negotiating.

74
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,260
So for some background,
for people that are unfamiliar with the

75
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:54,320
situation in Somalia,
Somalia,

76
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:59,321
if you correct me if I'm wrong,
that area was traditionally fishermen

77
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,450
and yeah,
that's wrong.

78
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,400
It's wrong.
So that's actually the point of the

79
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:07,830
book.
That's actually one level of the title

80
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,530
of the desert in the sea.
So that's uh,

81
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:11,050
um,
you,

82
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,300
you get the idea from things that Somali
pirates like to say,

83
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,420
oh,
that they're just frustrated fishermen.

84
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,550
Uh,
that's the only part of the story.

85
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,640
And so that's a,
that's a very important premise in the

86
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:23,474
book.
They,

87
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,620
they,
um,

88
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,170
there are,
you know,

89
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,010
fishing communities on the coast and
they're being hard hit definitely by

90
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:34,100
illegal ships that come in to steal the
fish,

91
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:35,780
you know,
but that's a problem up and down in

92
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:38,240
Africa.
And because of that problem,

93
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,770
once Somalia had no government,
there was no navy navy to defend the

94
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:46,360
coastline,
um,

95
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,410
local sort of clan leaders would send
out militia boats with militiamen and

96
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,490
hold fishing boats for,
you know,

97
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,890
$50,000,
ransoms over 24 hour periods,

98
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:59,330
you know,
really nothing very much.

99
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:02,720
And they called it a license fee and
that's how you did business in Somalia

100
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:04,640
in the nineties.
We didn't hear about that.

101
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:07,460
It was too small time.
We started to hear about it when they

102
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:10,190
graduated to capturing cargo ships.

103
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,820
What I'd heard was that there was
illegal dumping that wasn't just

104
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:15,654
fishing,
so.

105
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,823
Yep.
Yeah.

106
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,150
And that they initially called
themselves the people's coast guard of

107
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:23,140
Somalia or the voluntary coastguard one
or

108
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,020
a pirate.
Um,

109
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,700
gangs tried to call themselves that and
they had a point,

110
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,070
there was no,
no one else patrolling the coast,

111
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,140
but that wasn't really what was going
on.

112
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,993
No,
no.

113
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,050
I was captured on land.
First of all,

114
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,770
every other Qa,
a hostage I met was a fisherman.

115
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:43,980
A poor fishermen captured hundreds of
miles from the Somali coast.

116
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,360
So that's not protecting the cost.

117
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,700
So what role does this stuff called cat
k,

118
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:55,701
h a t this is a,
it's a plant that they chew and it has

119
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:57,970
like a stimulant effect.
Yeah,

120
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,620
it's a little bit like coca leaf,
but I think actually it's a narcotic

121
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,650
gets you high at first.
Um,

122
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,630
and then you crash and you wake up
depressed and you need more.

123
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,100
Uh,
but these guys,

124
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,370
every single pirate I met was addicted,
um,

125
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,400
and they wound up having to sit in front
of these piles of cut every afternoon

126
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,920
just to get high enough for their
addiction.

127
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,410
And um,
then like I said,

128
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:23,540
they would,
they would crash at night and then do it

129
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,190
again.
In my case,

130
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:27,920
there were,
there were guards 24 hours a day,

131
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:32,040
which meant there was also a shift that
slept during the day to cut at night and

132
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,470
then,
and then crash in the morning.

133
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,260
What did you try any of that stuff?
Yeah,

134
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,270
I mean they,
they kept offering it to me.

135
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,550
It wasn't like they know take like two
or three stems with three or four times

136
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:43,880
now.

137
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,190
Not much,
but it changed your mood,

138
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,200
you know,
you could be depressed and you'd feel

139
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:52,100
better or you can be a little bit sick
and you just wouldn't feel it anymore.

140
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,120
Um,
but I didn't want to get addicted to it,

141
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:57,730
so I didn't,
I didn't keep pushing it.

142
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,420
It's that addictive.
Yeah.

143
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,260
Well,
I saw it.

144
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:02,570
I saw how addictive it could be with the
guards.

145
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,950
Uh,
you know,

146
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,980
a little bit on an afternoon.
Didn't make me want to keep doing it

147
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:08,140
necessarily,
but every,

148
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,220
every now and then I did it just for the
sake of my mood.

149
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:10,510
Yeah.

150
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,120
That's always in the narrative.
This cat stuff,

151
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,330
the,
that are some how or another unhinged

152
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,830
because they're on this stuff all the
time.

153
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:19,540
Yeah,
I mean you can get really unhinged in

154
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,510
the sense that you're,
once you're wired on it,

155
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,370
you're easily sort of upset and these
guys would have sometimes have

156
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:27,990
fistfights in front of me and that kind
of thing.

157
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,520
We're not all the time,
but yeah,

158
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:31,920
they would get,
they would get hopped up,

159
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,190
they would just get jittery.
And that's a very dangerous with

160
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:36,270
Kalashnikovs lying around.

161
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,040
So their culture somehow or another has
evolved to this point where it's

162
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:47,670
insanely common to kidnap people to the
point where if you,

163
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,970
if you talk about Somali pirates,
they're,

164
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,060
the very few countries were pirates go
after their name so easily.

165
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,590
Yeah.
The,

166
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,740
they,
um,

167
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,500
kidnapping became part of the culture.
That's true.

168
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,850
But pirate bosses which are not so
active now off the coast,

169
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,700
I'm also have other businesses that they
get involved in.

170
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,740
And so I've written about this in the
meantime to they they get involved in a

171
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,750
gun smuggling and also even people
smuggling on the Horn of Africa.

172
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,190
So,
um,

173
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,470
whatever it takes that kind of
equipment,

174
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,330
you know,
suv,

175
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,230
Kalashnikovs,
cheap food.

176
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,510
When you say people smuggling,
what do you mean?

177
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,060
Um,
it's a good story.

178
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,300
I found out,
uh,

179
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,100
I'm,
I'm the person that proved that on the

180
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:33,850
route between Somalia to Libya.
Um,

181
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,740
some former pirate bosses were active
and moving people,

182
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,540
so in other words,
Somalis who want to go to Libya will put

183
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,640
themselves in the hands of some
traffickers and some of those

184
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,020
traffickers might be x pirates,

185
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,640
but w w go there as far as just being
transported willingly,

186
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,080
willingly at first.

187
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,760
And then,
um,

188
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:58,380
there's always a place in Sudan,
it shifts from being willing to being

189
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:59,214
unwilling.
Well,

190
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,770
this is an issue that's been going on in
Libya recently.

191
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,280
You know,
I'm sure you saw the most recent slave

192
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:08,670
auctions that were videotaped and put on
Youtube,

193
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:10,010
which was,
the stories are awful.

194
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,250
I've heard this firsthand.
Yeah,

195
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,400
insanely disturbing that you're watching
a video tape of slave auctions in 2018

196
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,630
as well as more than disturbing it's
revival of what was going on when

197
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,500
slavery was legal.
So in other words,

198
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,380
I'm okay.
Where the,

199
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,730
where the Somalis are involved up to
the,

200
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,950
to the Libyan border is one story.
That's the story I've covered.

201
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,190
Um,
what happens in Libya is a different

202
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:41,700
story.
The clans and the roots that migrants

203
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:44,280
take through Libya,
the clans they put themselves in the

204
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:49,281
hands of 'em are still the same as the
clans and the routes that we used during

205
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:51,234
the slave trade.

206
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,130
Um,
so there's,

207
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,290
there's almost like a,
you know,

208
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,360
there's a,
there's a historical memory there of

209
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:00,240
what,
what went on and it's the same thing

210
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:01,074
happening.
Um,

211
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,660
so,
so I,

212
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,560
I suspect a lot of migrants don't quite
know how bad it can get a,

213
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,220
um,
the route up until Libya is probably

214
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,760
easier than Libya itself.
Libya itself sounds like a horror show

215
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,760
for the migrants.
Yeah.

216
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,300
Well,
it's particularly,

217
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,220
it's one of those bizarre things.
We have a horrible dictator like Walmart

218
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,240
Kadafi and he said,
well,

219
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,250
it's probably a good thing to get rid of
that guy.

220
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,020
Right?
But no,

221
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,710
when you get rid of them then you have
this power vacuum and apparently it's a

222
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,960
failed state now and it's gotten even
worse.

223
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,440
It's going in the direction of Somalia
right now in there,

224
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,170
a couple of rival governments.
I think it's a little bit more stable,

225
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,410
a than Somalia was after their dictator
fell,

226
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,240
but um,
it's similar.

227
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,070
There's a similar thing going on.
Um,

228
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,160
I,
it's true.

229
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,350
Gaddafi was a bad guy and,
but he was also a bulwark and he knew

230
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:59,400
that and he used that to his advantage
with a bulwark against,

231
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,310
against migration paths.
I've never heard that expression.

232
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,450
Oh yeah.
Bulwark,

233
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,220
bulwark.
Now what does that mean?

234
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,750
A roadblock.
Oh,

235
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,370
okay.
Um,

236
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,930
when you were there,
when you decided to take 10 days and

237
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:15,000
you'd done all this research,
what,

238
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,660
what did you expect when you went there
and what was different?

239
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,480
Well,
so we were careful about finding

240
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,500
security.
We found,

241
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,090
um,
a Somali elder in Berlin who could offer

242
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:31,170
the protection of his clan in Somalia
and he had done it with another

243
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,550
journalist,
journalist,

244
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:36,180
a German journalist,
and he took us out from Galkayo,

245
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,040
which is a town in central Somalia out
to the coast to hope you,

246
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,520
which is a pirate town you might have
heard of.

247
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,340
And Hybrid town.
Natural Pirate town.

248
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:46,320
Yeah.
So it's all pirates.

249
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,183
Well,
it's in,

250
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,380
it's in the control of,
of pirates.

251
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,070
So in other words,
the government that sits in Galkayo has

252
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:55,560
no influence there.
Uh,

253
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,170
the pirates are the ones with who,
who can have the say.

254
00:11:59,171 --> 00:11:59,600
So.

255
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,640
So what is their business like?
I mean,

256
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:04,850
when you say it's like a pirate town.
So the pirates are essentially in

257
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:07,310
control,
but like what else is going on there?

258
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,144
If you've got

259
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,160
control?
No,

260
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,810
normal Somali life is going on there.
But uh,

261
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:12,644
the,
the,

262
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
you know,
let's say the police force would be

263
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,220
pirates.
Yeah.

264
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,770
I mean when we got there it was pretty
quiet and we didn't see much normal life

265
00:12:21,771 --> 00:12:25,970
and we had a.
I'm a very organized interview and

266
00:12:25,971 --> 00:12:27,450
lunch,
um,

267
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,430
one afternoon with a,
with a guy who turned out to be a real

268
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:32,920
pirate.
No,

269
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,330
that wasn't a joke.
And then we,

270
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,910
we left around sundown and,
and that was it.

271
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:39,420
We didn't spend a whole lot of time and
hope you

272
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,890
when you were there and you,
uh,

273
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,540
will,
you eventually got captured and taken

274
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,740
hostage.
What,

275
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,720
what was the initial experience like?

276
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
Well,
so when that happened with the,

277
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,190
with the technical,
with the truck at first,

278
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:59,170
my mind actually recoiled from what was
going on.

279
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,450
I mean,
I actually was in denial for a couple of

280
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:02,320
seconds.
I thought,

281
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,800
okay,
just a roadblock,

282
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,290
you know?
Um,

283
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,100
but once they captured me,
I thought this is gonna be really hard

284
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:13,370
on my family.
Jesus and they,

285
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:14,204
yeah,
they,

286
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,540
they beat me with their guns.
They broke my wrist,

287
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,860
they bloodied my scout a and they broke
my glasses.

288
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,640
So that's the other thing I noticed
right away.

289
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:23,750
It was like,
Shit,

290
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,780
I'm going to be blind.
How about uh,

291
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,540
your odds?
I'm nearsighted,

292
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,320
it's not,
not good

293
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,770
and this is like initial,
like right away?

294
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:34,891
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

295
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:37,290
It happened in that first skirmish.
Yeah.

296
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,930
So your,
your wrist was broken right away because

297
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:43,740
I was trying to hold the car door closed
and they pounded on it with their gun

298
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:44,574
barrels.

299
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,170
Wow.
And uh,

300
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,073
is it hard to talk?

301
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,710
Uh,
no,

302
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:55,220
because now I've written the book.
I wouldn't have been able to do this

303
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:58,820
before writing the book,
but reading the book familiarized myself

304
00:13:58,821 --> 00:13:59,950
with my own memories.
You know,

305
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,950
it made me fluent with this material,
but your physical state seems to shift

306
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:05,150
when you discuss it,
like,

307
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,223
oh,
maybe

308
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,170
your,
your,

309
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,330
your shoulders have risen.
Sure.

310
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,610
You're like,
yeah,

311
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,760
I mean it's a question of,
you know,

312
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,290
it's just not pleasant.
I couldn't imagine.

313
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,221
Yeah,
I mean,

314
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:21,090
it must have been just insane.
Um,

315
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,450
so you said there was a long period of
time before.

316
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,000
Were your,
before they contacted anybody,

317
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,230
who do they contact?

318
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,920
Um,
okay.

319
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:34,921
So it was a week and they,
so I had a grant reporting grant from

320
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,110
the Pulitzer Center on crisis reporting.
I should've called them.

321
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,050
Uh,
but I had all my notes stolen,

322
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:46,051
which means all my phone numbers too.
And so when they finally brought me up

323
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:49,480
to a bluff with a little cell phone and
said,

324
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:50,470
call somebody,
I said,

325
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:51,620
well,
bring me my notes.

326
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:52,910
I need to,
you know,

327
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,380
find the right phone number.
I said,

328
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:55,280
no,
just call someone.

329
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,980
So I called my mom.
Um,

330
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,000
and,
and that's what happened by that.

331
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,000
By that time,
the FBI had informed her,

332
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,530
had actually come to her door and
briefed her a little on what to say on

333
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:10,550
the phone.
So,

334
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:12,350
um,
she was ready for the phone call,

335
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,650
you know,
she'd been sitting around for days

336
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:17,360
wondering when she was going hear from
me.

337
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,280
Um,
so,

338
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,210
but that was also true about the
Pulitzer Center was also true about my

339
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:24,950
colleagues that should be go online in
Berlin.

340
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,020
It was also true,
but my family in Germany,

341
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,670
everyone had been briefed a little bit
now.

342
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,670
Were they waiting for a specific reason?
Why did they wait a whole week until

343
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:37,190
they do?
It's a really good question.

344
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,910
I kept asking for a phone call and I
mean,

345
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,360
I was sitting there kind of in a panic
to,

346
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,860
you know,
what were they saying to you during this

347
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,091
week?
Said,

348
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:44,720
Oh yeah,
okay.

349
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,260
You have a broken arm,
right?

350
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,100
So you're,
you're obviously,

351
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:51,130
you're in pain,
you can't see anymore.

352
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,360
Yeah,
I was in,

353
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:53,194
uh,
the first,

354
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,300
first they took me to a Bush camp.
Then they took me with a couple of other

355
00:15:56,301 --> 00:16:00,170
hostages to a prison house.
And uh,

356
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:02,970
yeah,
I had my wrist in a sling and um,

357
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,970
it just was,
it was painful.

358
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,380
It was,
it was confusing.

359
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:10,880
I really didn't know what was going on.

360
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,450
And then slowly they brought a doctor in
to look at the wrist and then slowly

361
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:17,960
they took us out into the bush and then
finally they do put me on the phone.

362
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,710
So you got medical treatment for your
wrist?

363
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,970
Sort of?
Yeah.

364
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,780
The Guy said it was,
it was probably a livestock doctor,

365
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:29,540
but the guy was,
he was a very sympathetic old,

366
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,930
older man,
but he said your wrist is not broken and

367
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:34,480
he put a splint on it.
And that was it.

368
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,240
It was broken.
Not Broken in half,

369
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:39,660
you know?
But definitely correct.

370
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,750
I felt I felt bones moving around in
there.

371
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,780
It's been rearranged.
It's been reshaped.

372
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,300
Did you eventually get medical treatment
when you get home for you?

373
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:49,841
Oh yeah.
What?

374
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,590
I got home.
But the surgery,

375
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,180
no,
two years and eight months later it was,

376
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,470
it was okay.
Fine.

377
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,840
Sense of functioning restaurant.

378
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,390
Yeah,
it's,

379
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,690
it's set wrong,
but it's a functioning risk.

380
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:00,650
Did you get an x Ray?
Just so you could see how weird it

381
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:01,970
looks,
didn't even bother.

382
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,000
Well,
now when you're there,

383
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,150
um,
once you get the initial phone call,

384
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,070
what is,
what is the process like after that?

385
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,140
Are they there?
Are they talking to you about what they

386
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:13,030
want?
Yeah,

387
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,711
they said,
okay,

388
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:16,100
do you have to demand $20,000,000 from
your mother?

389
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,680
Well,
I think I must have smirked or

390
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:20,110
something.
They said it's not funny.

391
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,430
Said yes,
actually it is.

392
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:23,120
That's not a serious demand,
you know?

393
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,550
Um,
but that was their opening gambit.

394
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,670
20 million.
What was specifically 20 million?

395
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,260
That's a good question.
They are the first two hostages I was

396
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,740
held with to say Wa fishermen.
Um,

397
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,690
the rent and for them was also 20
million,

398
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,270
but that's 10 million each.
So maybe they were just doubling it for

399
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:42,104
the American.

400
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,830
There was a time where they told you
that if people showed up for you that

401
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:49,980
you were going to be killed.
Oh,

402
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:52,530
sure.
They said that right away because by the

403
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:57,531
time the phone call had happened,
the raid for Jessica Buchanan and Poltis

404
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,230
dad had already happened too.
So,

405
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,300
um,
they even mentioned that to me and of

406
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:05,070
course I had no idea what they were
talking about.

407
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,240
I had no news,
you know,

408
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,600
so,
um,

409
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,650
I mentioned it to my mother on the
phone.

410
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:13,200
I said they're talking about a rate and
they're saying if somebody else comes

411
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:14,490
from me,
I'm going to get shot dead.

412
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,340
But you know,
those,

413
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,370
those are already the terms of a
kidnapping.

414
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,240
That was not a big change in my
situation.

415
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,910
Uh,
and my mom could tell me very little on

416
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:26,010
the phone about,
about the rescue,

417
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:29,100
but she had something positive than your
voice.

418
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:29,671
She says,
Oh yeah,

419
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:32,190
the rescue.
And I thought that doesn't sound like

420
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,220
the pirates of course told me the
hostages had been killed.

421
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,470
Like that doesn't sound like it went
bad,

422
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,370
but it was still another month and a
half or something before I found out the

423
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,204
full story.

424
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,250
Two and a half years is,
I know two years and eight months.

425
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,570
God,
now you ate with them,

426
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,620
you got used to them.
Did you almost become friends with them?

427
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,210
Sure.
I became friends with,

428
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,620
you know,
have friends with,

429
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,800
with about half the pirate guard group
that was with me at that point,

430
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,310
so I was held a number of places.
They also placed me on a tuna ship.

431
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,080
I was placed on a ship hijacked by
Somali pirates for about five months and

432
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:17,400
I think I'm the only western writer to
know life on a ship like that.

433
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,110
Five months for the full spring and
summer of 2012.

434
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,710
And then it was,
it was after that that was held on land.

435
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,910
I'm alone with the guards and that's
when I got to know the guards.

436
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,370
You must've had this feeling like
they're never going to find me.

437
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,530
They're moving me around and putting me
on a ship.

438
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,600
That was a problem.
Once the.

439
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:41,150
Especially when they put me on the ship,
I,

440
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,300
I felt like any progress the military
had made in finding my location would've

441
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,850
been completely reset.
You know,

442
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:53,220
I was terribly depressed when they first
put me on the ship.

443
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,910
Oh,
you were there for five months?

444
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,190
Yeah.
But once I was on the ship,

445
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,460
I felt better because there were 28
other hostages,

446
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,680
the crew of the ship and they were
great.

447
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,300
Um,
it was,

448
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,290
it's always better to have company when
you're a accounting.

449
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,381
Yeah.
So the,

450
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:11,370
the,
the other people that were running the

451
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:13,380
ship when they captured it,
they were there as well.

452
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,860
Yeah.
And that was a crew of 20th guys from

453
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,220
East Asian and Southeast Asia.
Did they speak English?

454
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,490
Only five of them,
so five of them were from the

455
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:26,310
Philippines and we got along with them
really good.

456
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,700
Uh,
everyone else we had to get to know

457
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:32,430
somehow and the ship,
they couldn't speak to each other either

458
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,770
because they had who's a,
like a tower of Babel on the ship.

459
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,800
And so they've developed their own
pigeon,

460
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,140
which is what sailors have done for
centuries,

461
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:42,780
you know,
it was a pigeon mixture of English and

462
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:45,300
Chinese and a few other words.
Wow.

463
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,590
Yeah.
That was fascinating.

464
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,240
Yeah.
I could imagine now as a writer,

465
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,720
you,
you had to be sort of like halfway torn.

466
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:53,111
Like,
God,

467
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:55,840
if I get out of here,
what a fucking story.

468
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,630
Yeah.
Uh,

469
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,760
yeah,
uh,

470
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:59,230
I knew I was,
you know,

471
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,860
living through interesting things and
gathering good material,

472
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,600
but um,
after at least a year or so in

473
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,300
captivity,
I stopped hoping that I was going to get

474
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:10,870
out alive.

475
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,330
I mean,
things were going so badly as far as the

476
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:16,420
negotiation was concerned that I thought
this is really the,

477
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:19,690
I'm really in deep shit now.
Is that standard for them to hold people

478
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:21,790
for that long?
Yeah,

479
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,320
uh,
yes and no.

480
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,310
Um,
I think I was held longer than any

481
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:32,311
westerner,
but the men on that ship didn't get out

482
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:36,010
for an hour for a total of five years,
just under five years they were held.

483
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,720
Um,
but they did get out.

484
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:40,450
Eventually they did get out in 2016.
Wow.

485
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,120
And I was privileged enough to go to
Nairobi and see them there.

486
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,010
I took him by surprise.
Wow.

487
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,710
So you flew out to meet them?
Well,

488
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:50,040
I was still living in Berlin and I was
following the,

489
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,180
the case very closely.
Um,

490
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,940
and the,
I helped raise some money.

491
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,660
The lawyers who were running it slow me
down there.

492
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,150
Um,
and that was really nice.

493
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:04,210
And it was nice for the guys to,
because they were obviously confused,

494
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:07,990
there was nothing but very well meaning,
but completely anonymous people around

495
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:08,824
them,
you know,

496
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,550
and then they were,
they kind of came out of the terminal in

497
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:17,030
Nairobi and they were still obviously
still sort of a little bit confused and

498
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,270
they're tapped one of them on the
shoulder and he recognized me and it was

499
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,760
pandemonium.
Wow.

500
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,770
There's a,
it was wound up on Reuters video.

501
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:27,280
I think it's available now.
How did you eventually get fried?

502
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,800
Uh,
they.

503
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,620
So my mom raised a ransom,
um,

504
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,280
she raised it with help from family and
friends and also some magazines.

505
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:40,720
I'd worked for some institutions in the
US and in Germany.

506
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:46,170
And um,
when she talked the pirates down to one

507
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:50,980
point 6 million,
then I got out for some reason at the

508
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:53,920
very end the pirates came down
precipitously.

509
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,120
The very end after two years they
holding on for like,

510
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,480
I think they went down to four or $5
million or something like that.

511
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:04,060
And then at the very end that came down
to what was on offer.

512
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,910
No explanation.
Not really accept that from my point of

513
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:10,744
view.
Um,

514
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,830
there were labor,
there was a labor unrest stirring among

515
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:16,030
the guards.
So in other words,

516
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:19,570
the guards were sick of holding me.
And so I,

517
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,810
um,
one day towards the very end,

518
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:23,860
but um,
you know,

519
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,140
a few weeks before I got out,
one of the guards actually said,

520
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,300
Michael,
we might go on strike like Detroit got,

521
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,250
do you need some help with that?
I can go on a hunger strike if you want.

522
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:35,740
They're like slow,
slow now.

523
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,430
There was one thing that I read were a
guarded left.

524
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:44,260
You alone with a loaded rifle.
It happened more than once.

525
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,190
What is the,
what's the thought process there in your

526
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:50,140
mind?
Yeah,

527
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,930
that was.
So,

528
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,190
especially after the first year or so.
And until how many guards you talking

529
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:58,100
about?
We're talking about seven to 15 at any

530
00:23:58,101 --> 00:24:00,090
given point in,
um,

531
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,070
how many bullets are in the gun the.
Well,

532
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,000
it was a Kalashnikov sis.
A minimum of 16.

533
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,550
Um,
that's not enough.

534
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,120
It's not enough.
Um,

535
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,910
and there were,
there were,

536
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,450
there were always a few guards who were
asleep.

537
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,210
A few go to awake and so you go through
this thing in your head,

538
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:21,044
you think,
well,

539
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,740
I can grab the gun,
I can kill a few guys,

540
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,890
but it would be suicidal.
But I went through various scenarios in

541
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:32,510
my head all the time,
you know,

542
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:34,970
that was a,
that was a very big temptation because

543
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,370
the guns just lay around like junk,
you know?

544
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,600
Um,
and that was,

545
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,530
that was a dark period because the
question was not just can I blast my way

546
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:49,700
out and live,
but also should I just take care of it,

547
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,140
right and kill myself now because I knew
that I was causing a whole lot of

548
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:57,740
trouble for my family at home and then
we're probably military plans to come

549
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:00,410
get me,
which would put seals at risk or a

550
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:01,730
special operators at risk.

551
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:06,790
And so it's better to just check out.
And so that was on my mind often.

552
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:09,500
Especially during the second year.

553
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,000
Were they sympathetic characters in any
way?

554
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:14,990
I mean,
did you,

555
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,670
when you were around them for long
periods of time and you're taking into

556
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:22,550
consideration this life that's been
thrust upon them,

557
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,840
that this is the environment there grew
up in and this is the mean you,

558
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:29,990
you had to have at least in some way
gotten to know them?

559
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,610
Sure.
And I went there thinking,

560
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:32,420
well,
you know,

561
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,510
I'm going to tell their stories somehow.
Um,

562
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,810
did you tell them that?
Yeah.

563
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,990
But by the time I was captured,
that didn't matter.

564
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,683
No,
I'm,

565
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,680
yes,
of course they,

566
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,560
they were,
especially the ones who wanted to talk

567
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:46,880
to me.
Of course they were sympathetic.

568
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,190
Um,
they're the poor people.

569
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,110
So the,
even if it's not true that most pirates

570
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:57,440
are frustrated fishermen,
probably only about 20 percent of them

571
00:25:57,441 --> 00:25:58,360
are,
uh,

572
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,040
all of them report,
all of them need jobs and that's why

573
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,810
they became pirates.
Um,

574
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,320
you have to layer on top of that.
The fact that it caught habit is

575
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:09,680
extremely ruinously expensive and in
Somalia,

576
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,170
where does that come from?
Cut.

577
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,540
Comes from highlands.
So it has to be grown in the mountains

578
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:17,000
of Ethiopia,
Kenya and flown in fresh.

579
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,930
Uh,
can't be grown in a flat hot desert

580
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:22,190
region like,
like Somalia,

581
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:23,600
Yemen,
but that's where it's popular,

582
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,060
especially among Muslims who can't drink
alcohol.

583
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,560
So,
um,

584
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,980
it's,
there's this whole trade in that region

585
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,950
of the world and most of,
most of the time it's legal.

586
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,220
I think they only illegal illegalized it
in Britain,

587
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,380
for example,
in 2014.

588
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,083
Really?
Yep.

589
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,470
I think it's illegal here,
but,

590
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:43,770
um,
the trade,

591
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,210
it just flows like water in that in
Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula.

592
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,610
So the voluntary coastguard of Somalia,
what we've been led to believe that this

593
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,430
is how it all started out.
How did that narrative get established?

594
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,060
So once they started to capture big
ships,

595
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,140
they fell back on that story,
which had been true up until then,

596
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,750
which was,
which is defending our coastline from

597
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,640
fishing.
So it started that way.

598
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,190
So did that know that right?
It's true.

599
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:12,120
And the roots of it.
Okay.

600
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:14,330
So that's what I'd heard.
What I'd heard is that it would,

601
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,570
it,
it started because,

602
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,050
not just because people were fishing out
there because they were dumping toxic

603
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:20,160
waste also.

604
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,143
Um,
yeah.

605
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,770
And that was also true,
um,

606
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,200
the Mafia was dumping,
we had a,

607
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,020
had a,
the mafia,

608
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:28,770
you know,
there were,

609
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,270
there were actual,
it's been sort of uncovered by Italian

610
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:36,930
journalist,
but the Italian mafia had found a way to

611
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:41,931
bring waste for a certain amount of
money down to someplace where they

612
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:44,980
thought nobody would see it again.
Um,

613
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:50,060
and that some of it washed ashore in
2004 with the Indonesian tsunami that

614
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:54,420
actually reached that part of East
Africa.

615
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,540
So some of those big things that the
Italians dumped over the side of their

616
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:03,660
boats wound up on the beach and Somalia.
Oh,

617
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:07,410
so an actual physical vat or something
that they can see what it was.

618
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,030
And I saw one of them.
Yeah.

619
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:09,923
Really?
Yeah.

620
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,480
What was in it?
I don't know,

621
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:16,950
but it was a great big sort of orange,
great big leg,

622
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,360
weirdly shaped cube.

623
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,370
How large?
A taller than me.

624
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:25,490
So at least eight feet square and it had
been used to contain some sort of toxic

625
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:27,300
waste.
That's what my fixer told me.

626
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,640
So.
But I had seen pictures,

627
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,010
similar pictures in,
um,

628
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,920
documentaries.
So I think it was probably true,

629
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,390
it's described in the book just briefly,
but um,

630
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,140
I,
that's the kind of thing that happened.

631
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,940
Certainly.
Um,

632
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,310
the,
the Italians were not,

633
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,690
or the mafia was not being very,
you know,

634
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,040
they were being criminals too.
So yeah,

635
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,220
that's the third business business.
Um,

636
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,580
did you watch the Tom Hanks movie?
I watched 45 minutes at the Tom Hanks

637
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,220
movie in Somalia.
In Somalia.

638
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,570
While you're captive?
Yeah.

639
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,380
Holy Shit.
What is that like?

640
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,190
Well,
I said,

641
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,590
well,
I knew that I knew Captain Phillips was

642
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:13,260
going to be a movie when I left.
It was already clear,

643
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:17,190
had already announced it or something.
So they had announced it when you left

644
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:19,920
and you got to watch it when Somalia.

645
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,300
Yeah,
because by the time,

646
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,800
this is towards the end of my captivity,
I had a shortwave radio,

647
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:28,440
so I was listening to the radio.
By the time it came out and went to the

648
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:29,940
Oscars,
it was all over the BBC.

649
00:29:29,941 --> 00:29:31,350
So I knew about it.
I knew it was out.

650
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,011
I'm like,
okay,

651
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:34,130
so I'm missing Captain Phillips,
whatever,

652
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,150
wonder what that's like.
And then one day all the guards got new

653
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,350
smartphones,
pretty fancy,

654
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:43,420
smart,
and they were apparently loaded with a

655
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:46,900
new collection of films and music and
whatever to keep them occupied.

656
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,830
One afternoon I saw two guards just
completely wrapped by some sort of film

657
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,440
on the phone and I heard some American
voices.

658
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:57,880
I'm like,
I'm wondering what this film is.

659
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,340
And finally I said,
fuck me.

660
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:04,360
That's Tom Hanks.
So I knew what they were watching.

661
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,490
And two weeks later one of the guards
actually,

662
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,710
she handed me the phone and said,
you know,

663
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:09,544
Michael,
look.

664
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,730
And so I saw about 45 minutes of it.
Wow.

665
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,260
And of course when he handed me the
phone,

666
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:16,180
the first thing that went through my
mind is like,

667
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,110
okay,
I'm going to call mom,

668
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,140
just find a way to turn down the volume
and,

669
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,270
and,
and call California.

670
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,510
He took the phone away before I did
that.

671
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,510
But I had a whole plan.
I developed a whole plan while I was

672
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:29,740
watching Captain Phillips,
you know,

673
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:32,800
get on the plane in Boston,
Logan or whatever.

674
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,580
Wow.
It was so atmospherically.

675
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,770
It was a pretty good,
pretty well done movie,

676
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:40,810
but there were a couple of scenes where
that would,

677
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,220
it just wouldn't have happened in real
life.

678
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,840
I didn't watch the movie.
Yeah.

679
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,820
So what was inaccurate about,
uh,

680
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,910
there was one scene where there was some
selection of pirates on the beach,

681
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,000
so in public,
um,

682
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:53,861
and I thought,
Gosh,

683
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:54,730
how did they get that?

684
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,540
That's,
that's,

685
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,720
I've never even heard of that before.
And then I thought about it and thought

686
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,560
and realized,
well,

687
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,720
that yeah,
actually wouldn't happen like that in

688
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:03,940
public.
That was just for dramatic purposes.

689
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,170
Um,
you know,

690
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,440
I was,
I was invasive their material at first

691
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:09,730
and then I realize now that I made that
up,

692
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,880
um,
so things like that,

693
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,450
but the pirates were fascinated to see
people like them and in some cases

694
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:20,770
they're friends.
I'm portrayed on screen and even though

695
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:21,900
we all know how,
you know,

696
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,820
the movie ends very badly for Somali
pirates.

697
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,270
So.
So they knew about the story that was

698
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:29,104
based on.
Yeah,

699
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,490
no question.
Not only that,

700
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:34,210
but one of them said that he was friends
with one of the pirates involved and I

701
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:37,780
believe him actually he had the right
clan affiliation for that.

702
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:39,250
So it's,
it's quite possible.

703
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,640
What was it like to see them watching
their story being depicted on the other

704
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:45,700
side of the planet?

705
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,800
Well,
that's what was weird is that they,

706
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,590
they were so fascinated by it,
but we,

707
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:54,100
you know,
otherwise they didn't necessarily like

708
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:57,430
to talk about bad news for pirates or
you know,

709
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,300
like I said,
when the hostages were released,

710
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,030
um,
or rescued in the first few days of my

711
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:05,650
captivity,
um,

712
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,740
I kept hearing that the hostages had
been killed.

713
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,010
So they like to spin things in a,
in a good way for,

714
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,690
for pirates in general.
So I,

715
00:32:14,691 --> 00:32:17,860
I just would have assumed they would
just ignore captain phillips because it

716
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,500
been so badly.
They were just fascinated.

717
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,310
They really were.
And so what was daily life like for you?

718
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:25,720
Like you,
you ate with them?

719
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,000
Well,
I separately,

720
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:33,001
but sometimes in the same room they,
they made very bad food,

721
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,140
boiled beans and flavorless boiled goat
and that kind of thing.

722
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,450
Um,
but they would eat from a communal

723
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:47,280
platter is sort of elsewhere within
sight.

724
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,980
Um,
I didn't have to eat from the same

725
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:52,280
platter as they eat by hand by hand.
Yeah.

726
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,340
Yeah.
That's a very common in that part of the

727
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:56,091
world.
Yeah,

728
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:57,920
it really is because utensils just
aren't,

729
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,840
aren't that common.
And they really liked spaghetti so they

730
00:33:00,841 --> 00:33:02,630
sort of wrap the spaghetti around your
fingers.

731
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:04,430
And I had done that as a free man,
you know,

732
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:07,910
I sort of sat with Somalis in and eight
that way.

733
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,530
But as a,
as a hostage,

734
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:11,550
I was in no mood to be that,
you know,

735
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,860
that friendly.
Yeah.

736
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,250
They,
they gave me a fork and I could eat my

737
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,370
on my own.
So how,

738
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:22,640
like what kind of physical state were
you in after two and a half years of

739
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:23,090
this?
Yeah,

740
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,040
it was pretty bad.
I was my,

741
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,140
um,
my immune system,

742
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:30,800
it started to fall apart.
So I don't go into detail too much about

743
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:35,510
this in the book,
but I had a staph infection and my skin

744
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:39,740
and some other kind of infection in my
ear and I was just something in my

745
00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:40,190
lungs.

746
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,200
I was just not very,
I was sick,

747
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,990
um,
and I was sick constantly for several

748
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,660
months before I got out.
So I knew something had really changed

749
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,930
and I think the pirates were aware of
that too slowly.

750
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,460
I think that probably possibly
contributed to them lowering your ransom

751
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,050
possibly.
But,

752
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,030
but I,
you know,

753
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,180
not that they were sympathetic,
but uh,

754
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,520
it's possible they saw me sort of
reaching,

755
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,830
reaching my physical limit slowly.
Yeah.

756
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,890
Slowly.
So it's not a for.

757
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:11,720
It's actually can get you pretty quickly
now.

758
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,410
Yeah.
I mean they wound up just being that,

759
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,470
but it was raising boils on my skin and
they knew about that.

760
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,010
So
that's not that long ago.

761
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,580
Two thousand 12 to 2014 was when you
were,

762
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,470
when that was released and had the
infection.

763
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,120
I mean four years ago.
That's nothing.

764
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,310
Pushing four years now.
What is,

765
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,730
what does it feel like now to be free to
you?

766
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,540
Do you still have,
do,

767
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:41,990
have ptsd from it?
Do you get um,

768
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,430
well now I can be happy about it.
I think the day I was released I was

769
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,760
sort of,
I felt better in stages,

770
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:53,190
but w it wasn't sudden euphoria.
Um,

771
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,830
now I can be really be happy about it.
It took me about a year to get back to

772
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:02,831
full strength and the symptoms of Ptsd
that I showed when I first got out,

773
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,100
which included like hyper hyper
vigilance.

774
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,440
I'm went away slowly as I got physically
strong hypervigilance being like wake up

775
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:14,730
in the middle of the night.
Nightmares that will,

776
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:18,080
that nightmares only happened within the
first year.

777
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,420
I'm waking up in the middle of the
night.

778
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:22,160
That still happens.
I still don't sleep too well.

779
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,520
Hypervigilance,
I mean out in public,

780
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,860
too many people around,
you know,

781
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:28,850
like you hear with vets.

782
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,580
Um,
and I was aware of that as a symptom and

783
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,060
I felt at first when we were out in
public in Nairobi and I turned to the

784
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,470
FBI psychologist who was with me and I
said,

785
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,940
you know,
am I hypervigilant?

786
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,460
He said,
maybe.

787
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,450
Then I said,
are you here because you know,

788
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,810
I might have ptsd.
He said,

789
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,880
we don't like to put a label on
anything.

790
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:52,050
And that was his attitude towards me.
That was the attack he took.

791
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,860
And in my case at least it was right.
Eventually he said,

792
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,530
that's it.
Shouldn't I be treated for PTSD or

793
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,840
shouldn't I be going to regular talk
therapy or something like that.

794
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:01,920
And he said,
you know,

795
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:04,650
you don't want to pathologize anything.
In other words,

796
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,710
you don't want to create mentally
another condition for you,

797
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,540
for you to recover from,
you know,

798
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:12,930
it's enough work for your mind and your
body to recover quite naturally.

799
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,620
They know how to do it from the,
all that trauma.

800
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,040
That's very interesting because I've
heard people talk about that with other

801
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,870
things,
particularly with war,

802
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,310
that you're,
you're better off not deciding what you

803
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:30,360
have.
We're not being told what you have in my

804
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:31,194
case.
That's true.

805
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,580
I mean,
who knows?

806
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,920
I think ptsd can be so complicated.
They're,

807
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,010
you know,
the pharmaceutical solutions in that

808
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:41,880
kind of thing for some people,
the body of my know how to recover.

809
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,010
So you have to,
you have to let them.

810
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:49,130
Do they give you techniques to recover
is in instead of explaining or

811
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:54,420
discussing what the issue is,
do they give you techniques to feel

812
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:58,560
better or to,
to establish more normal existence?

813
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,010
I know I didn't.
I mean,

814
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,870
I didn't get a checklist,
but the psychologist would say,

815
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:03,960
you know,
if something's bothering you,

816
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:04,970
write it down.
Um,

817
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,450
but he knew I was a writer.

818
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,820
He,
they made sure they knew that I had a

819
00:37:10,821 --> 00:37:14,670
loving family around me when I got back
and a great circle of friends in Berlin.

820
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,320
Uh,
that's really important.

821
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,400
Um,
I think everybody finds their own way.

822
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,260
I mean,
I knew I was weak.

823
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,460
I mean,
I was just physical,

824
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:24,380
like a race,
you know,

825
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,580
when I got out,
how much weight did you lose?

826
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,440
I lost about 40 pounds.
And um,

827
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,260
when I,
when I first came out and walked around

828
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:35,790
in Berlin,
Berlin's a walking city,

829
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:39,330
so I tried to lead like normal day,
um,

830
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,830
my knees swelled up in my ankle,
swelled up and they were really painful.

831
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,250
So it was like I just played a game of
football or something.

832
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,580
You weren't moving while you were there?
Yeah,

833
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,940
not enough.
I did yoga,

834
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,080
but I didn't go for a jog around the
room or something like you sometimes

835
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,070
hear for prisoners.

836
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,410
And if I'd done that I think they would
have been social to startle the,

837
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,240
they would've shot me,
uh,

838
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:05,241
but
I was not in any kind of shape for,

839
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,410
for normal life when I got out.
And in fact one day when I got back from

840
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:11,940
Berlin,
I tried to run for a street car.

841
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:13,950
I just didn't have the musculature for
it.

842
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:17,200
I simply didn't have a stride to run.
I could not run well,

843
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,350
I thought that was really weird.
Um,

844
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,560
but one of the doctors who tested me
said,

845
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,240
well,
you have a protein deficiency.

846
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,030
And once I started to take care of that
and I went consciously to the gym and

847
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,670
made sure I got stronger and also put on
more muscle.

848
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,010
Um,
the mental things sort of took care of

849
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,930
themselves too.
So there's that body mind connection was

850
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:38,764
really important

851
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:44,020
and when they're telling you this,
that you have a protein deficiency that

852
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:44,770
you need,
you know,

853
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,560
you should exercise and take care of
your body.

854
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:53,140
And this is improving is,
are they giving you guidelines like this

855
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:55,780
is,
this is probably a good idea to try to

856
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,580
do this.
I mean,

857
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,400
are there,
are there any strategies that people

858
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:04,630
have to deal with coming out of long
term incarceration?

859
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,290
No,
not specific ones.

860
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,220
I think it was clear to everyone that I
was easily overwhelmed.

861
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,710
So,
um,

862
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,260
you know,
at one point my family sat down with me

863
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:18,350
with all the paperwork that had to be
taken care of and I could only deal with

864
00:39:18,351 --> 00:39:20,780
that for like an hour at a time.
So,

865
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,880
and the debrief paperwork,
Oh,

866
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,170
I'm bank things to sign and that sort of
thing.

867
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,790
Um,
how so?

868
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:29,990
Well,
just let,

869
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,230
all my affairs were in somebody else's
hands when I was for the two and a half

870
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:34,280
years,
two and a half years.

871
00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:36,710
And so we had to sort of rectify a lot
of that.

872
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,040
Um,
you know,

873
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,840
I couldn't plow through it and then an
afternoon or in a week I had to do it in

874
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:45,770
stages and it was the same thing with
like a debriefing with the FBI,

875
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:49,280
which I did for three weeks.
I couldn't always do it for the entire

876
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:50,150
day.
What would happen?

877
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,350
My brain would like to actually seize
up.

878
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,190
I mean I actually would just,
I got,

879
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,950
I mean you said earlier when I talk
about it,

880
00:40:00,951 --> 00:40:04,520
I go like this.
My whole body would like constrict and I

881
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,610
would simply,
part of me would just shut down.

882
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,390
He,
you've,

883
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,270
you've leveled off now physically like
your shoulders,

884
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,000
but I'm looking at you right now from
our conversation.

885
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,893
Yeah.
But I don't feel

886
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,590
when you started talking about it,
your shoulders,

887
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,920
it seemed like started to almost visibly
rise up

888
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,070
probably.
Yeah.

889
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,150
But I'm saying when I first got out,
I must have been much more exact cause

890
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,070
paralytic.
No,

891
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:29,570
I mean I,
I just,

892
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,470
something inside me just shut down.
Yeah.

893
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,050
So it,
you're,

894
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,340
it just wouldn't,
you.

895
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,840
You just didn't have the capacity to sit
down and concentrate on anything.

896
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:42,440
It wasn't concentration.
It was a sense of overwhelm.

897
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,333
Yeah.
Well,

898
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,200
concentrating on too many things at
once.

899
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:48,290
I think it was also,
I was also overwhelmed by too many

900
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:49,020
friends,
you know,

901
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,010
too many people in the room because too
many social cues to read.

902
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,340
I didn't have that with the pirates.
It was real clear.

903
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,270
I was the hostage.
They were the guards in some sense we

904
00:40:59,271 --> 00:41:03,260
were enemies and that was it.
And we had real simple things to say to

905
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,420
each other and that was it.
And that was my life for,

906
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,190
for a couple of years after the,
um,

907
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,770
after the ship,
it was not complex.

908
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:14,690
And so when I got out the complexities
of a more comfortable life,

909
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,970
but um,
you know,

910
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,190
more elaborate life were really
difficult.

911
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,320
You're obviously,
you were aware of the time that you were

912
00:41:21,321 --> 00:41:23,720
struggling with this.
You were aware that it was difficult,

913
00:41:23,721 --> 00:41:26,990
real clear,
but what were you confused by that

914
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:27,824
difficulty?

915
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,770
No,
not confused.

916
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:32,230
I wasn't sure how it was going to
recover,

917
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:35,060
but I,
I knew to take it slow and taking it

918
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:37,090
slow as important.
Now.

919
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,470
How did you ultimately recover the.
Yeah,

920
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,080
one,
one day at a time like that.

921
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:44,900
I mean I've consciously got better
physically.

922
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,690
I'm going to consciously did yoga and
went to,

923
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,450
went to the gym consciously eight.
Well My,

924
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,220
my um,
my doctor said don't follow a vegetarian

925
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:56,180
diet but eat a full diet and make sure
you get enough protein.

926
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,760
Why not have a vegetarian diet?
So you need protein,

927
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,200
but you,
you need a lot of protein,

928
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,930
animal protein specifically
now,

929
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:10,720
what is your situation now?
Is that you said you still,

930
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:15,780
you still have a hard time sleeping and
what is it a nightmare issue or is it an

931
00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:18,160
anxiety issue?

932
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,200
No,
not nightmares,

933
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:22,620
but for some reason when it gets so in
Somalia,

934
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,850
when it came time to go to bed,
at least for a long period,

935
00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:30,930
they would chain up my feet and I would
have to lie on a mattress under a

936
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,780
mosquito net.
And that was it for 12 hours.

937
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,260
So now when it comes time to sleep,
um,

938
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:41,760
instead of tired,
I get anxious and then it's possible

939
00:42:41,761 --> 00:42:43,260
that I,
I might wake up,

940
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,480
you know,
fully awake after only four hours.

941
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,480
So I take Melatonin.
It's nothing,

942
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,510
it's nothing.
I don't take hard drugs to sleep,

943
00:42:51,511 --> 00:42:54,210
but I take a little assistance.
Yeah.

944
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:55,523
Wow.

945
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,530
Now this book that you wrote of the
desert in the sea,

946
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,760
how,
how difficult was it to sit down in

947
00:43:02,761 --> 00:43:07,320
front of a computer and sort of
recapture these thoughts

948
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,410
and transcribe them?
Yeah,

949
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:11,720
they're well.
So that was also sort of blood and

950
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:15,080
sweat.
The research was blood,

951
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:16,880
sweat and tears.
And so it was the writing.

952
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,360
But um,
I did know at least this the facts of

953
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:26,270
the story.
So I put those down first and then we

954
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:31,271
went back and did how it felt.
So the putting everything down,

955
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,960
which a writer likes to do,
you know,

956
00:43:32,961 --> 00:43:36,650
all at once in one sort of great active
creation,

957
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:37,683
um,
that,

958
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,050
that would have been a little
overwhelming.

959
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:41,960
So I did it in layers and that was the
way to go.

960
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,120
What were you like before this and what
do you like now and what's different?

961
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:51,530
I think my,
my basic self is the same,

962
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,450
but I,
I,

963
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,730
I'm more patient.
Um,

964
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,840
I'm more grateful.
So just getting out alive,

965
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,900
um,
made me certainly grateful to be around.

966
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,970
It was great to see my family and
friends again and if I ever start to

967
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:11,870
feel ungrateful for something,
I have this well of memory that can go

968
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:14,630
back to um,
that's essential.

969
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,380
And I think in Somalia I also learned to
forgive,

970
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:19,930
which was,
you know,

971
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,930
not an easy process and it's something,
but I think it's something very

972
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:26,870
essential.
How so how'd you learn to forgive?

973
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,580
Um,
so we talked about picking up a

974
00:44:29,581 --> 00:44:31,800
Kalashnikov.
I was going to do that.

975
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,600
I thought about doing that and it was an
internal debate for really long time

976
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:41,640
until one point where I'm actually heard
something on the radio from the pope,

977
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,790
the new pope I'd never even seen before,
and he gave a very good homily about

978
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:51,930
what forgiveness meant and that
resonated and at some point I made a

979
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:54,540
conscious decision to forgive the guards
who were around me,

980
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:56,880
you know,
these are the lowest lowest ranking

981
00:44:56,881 --> 00:44:59,010
guys,
but they were making my life miserable

982
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:04,610
and I made a conscious decision to
forgive them and I had to do that over

983
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:08,760
and over and that made my mind a whole
lot more,

984
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:14,010
more stable and suddenly settled,
which means that unless I had done that,

985
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,680
I probably would have picked up a gun
and killed myself,

986
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:18,240
if not them or both.

987
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,270
That's fascinating that a speech by the
pope could resonate so strongly with you

988
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:28,320
while you were in captivity.
Just forgiveness.

989
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,020
Forgiveness wouldn't have had to be by
the pope,

990
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:32,130
but he.
He was pretty good.

991
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,650
That's something that people play,
pay lip service to and you know,

992
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:39,380
you hear people saying you should live a
life of forgiveness.

993
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:43,340
And it's healthier for you,
but no one can really understand that

994
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,520
the way you have.
For me it was life and death.

995
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,100
Wow,
man.

996
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,930
I mean,
I can't wait to read your book.

997
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:56,190
It is a crazy story.
You're doesn't mean.

998
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:01,490
It's just such an insane experience.
Was that your,

999
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:07,030
your just your well,
of experiences like what you can draw

1000
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:11,440
upon is so different from most people
that you're interacting with you.

1001
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:15,890
It must almost feel like you're going
through life interacting with privileged

1002
00:46:15,891 --> 00:46:17,900
children sometimes,
but the.

1003
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,500
So first of all,
which is very happy to be back in.

1004
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,660
Yeah.
In the world I grew up in.

1005
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,910
So that's the main thing.
Um,

1006
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,140
but yeah,
that comes up.

1007
00:46:27,141 --> 00:46:30,050
Sometimes you don't.
When people complain about things,

1008
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,440
for example,
oh,

1009
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:32,900
it's so fucking Horny,
right?

1010
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,370
Yeah.
You should try hot in Somalia prison

1011
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:38,980
where you're shackled to a bed.
Right?

1012
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:39,930
Exactly.
Yeah.

1013
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:43,920
We're idiots and traffic.
I'm a much more patient drive and so is

1014
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,220
my mother by the way.
Oh,

1015
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,240
I'm sure.
And so happy to get her son,

1016
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:48,450
but right.
Yeah.

1017
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,960
She's the heroine of the story.
I mean she really,

1018
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,400
she really took.
Oh,

1019
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,030
the
enormous amount.

1020
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,100
So is it like to see her after two
years?

1021
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,140
It was incredible.
No,

1022
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:03,500
I mean it was obviously she was on my
mind and all my friends and family were

1023
00:47:03,501 --> 00:47:06,890
on my mind while I was in Somalia and
just to see somebody that I'd been

1024
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:09,440
thinking about all this time and it's
sort of hypothetical way,

1025
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:13,710
um,
again in real life and the way that I

1026
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,650
really thought I wouldn't was
overwhelming.

1027
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,570
It was really,
really fantastic.

1028
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:24,340
Now had you gone to dangerous places for
journalism before Somalia?

1029
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,390
Where did you go on?
Uh,

1030
00:47:26,391 --> 00:47:28,910
so for my second book,
sweeten some.

1031
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,820
I surfed in Gaza.
Wow.

1032
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,810
Um,
and I'd been to northern Iraq and some

1033
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:37,810
other places,
but this was easily the most dangerous

1034
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,460
thing you do in Gaza.
Uh,

1035
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:43,330
W I went to see the Gaza Surf Club and I
actually went surfing with them.

1036
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,210
The Gaza Surf Club.
This exists.

1037
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,440
Yeah.
What is that?

1038
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:51,550
Um,
so it's a group of Palestinians who

1039
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,640
liked to surf but who don't have enough
surfboards.

1040
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:57,820
And uh,
so they organized into a club first to

1041
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:00,640
share a couple of surf boards that they
had found.

1042
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,400
And managed to manage to buy,
um,

1043
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,450
and also to receive donations from a
group of surfers and Tel Aviv who

1044
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:11,230
thought these guys should have boards.
And so there's a relationship.

1045
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:15,850
Grew up between a group in Tel Aviv
called surfing for peace and the Gaza

1046
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:15,970
Surf Club.

1047
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:20,970
So Jews in Tel Aviv or donating
surfboards to Palestinians.

1048
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,350
Wow.
It's completely wonderful.

1049
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:26,360
It's a grassroots peace initiative,
you know,

1050
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:30,910
it's been going on for years now,
but I'm one of the eloquent things that

1051
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:32,370
the leader of,
um,

1052
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,460
the,
the surfing for pease group said was

1053
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,340
we're not getting anywhere on an
official level so we better do something

1054
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:42,070
on sort of a grassroots level.
I think it's marvelous.

1055
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,840
Wow.
Um,

1056
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,030
what do you do now?
Oh,

1057
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:49,300
I.
So seeking out danger was never the

1058
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,110
point.
You know,

1059
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,480
I tried not to shrink from it,
but that was not,

1060
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,430
you know,
I'm not a thrill seeker and that's not

1061
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,550
the what I'm trying to base my career on
or anything like that.

1062
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,680
Um,
right now I'm writing a novel,

1063
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:04,540
so that should keep me seated for.
What's it about a two bedrooms,

1064
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:05,943
drones.

1065
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:13,410
That doesn't sound peaceful.
It's not what I'm not gonna say anymore

1066
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,643
about it.
Yeah,

1067
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,170
I get it.
Um,

1068
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:20,250
do you ever anticipate yourself
traveling for journals and began?

1069
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:21,460
Oh,
travel.

1070
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:23,380
Yeah.
But just nothing like this.

1071
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,131
Yeah.
No,

1072
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:27,040
I don't need to do dangerous travel
anytime soon.

1073
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,210
No,
no.

1074
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,060
Yeah.
Some people just want to jump right back

1075
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:32,590
into the fire.
Yeah,

1076
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:35,110
that's not.
But that was not the point in the first

1077
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:36,010
place.
Right.

1078
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,920
What was the point like?
What did you hope to get out of this

1079
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:40,180
trip to Somalia?
Well,

1080
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:43,240
so when,
one thing that I noticed while I was

1081
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,820
watching the trial and,
um,

1082
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:50,320
in,
in Hamburg was this clash between a

1083
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,420
modern liberal state,
which is what Germany is.

1084
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,300
And so it was America by the way.
Um,

1085
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,840
and in our case at crime and Germany in
fact is newer than the United States in

1086
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:06,370
the sense that its constitution was
written in 1949 when nobody was thinking

1087
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:07,204
about piracy.

1088
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:10,430
So the laws against piracy or extremely
lenient in,

1089
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,480
in German law in a way that they're not
in Spanish or American law,

1090
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,630
um,
we have laws that date back to when it

1091
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:20,620
was a capital crime
and basically the Germans didn't know

1092
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:24,130
how to deal with these guys and uh,
I thought it was fascinating in the

1093
00:50:24,131 --> 00:50:28,910
first place that this ancient crime had
revived after a couple of centuries of

1094
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:30,230
relative quiet,
you know,

1095
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,790
and um,
so that tension on its own was

1096
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:37,850
interesting and that was worth a book
because nobody was quite approaching it

1097
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:39,020
that way,
you know?

1098
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:43,040
Uh,
so that tension is still interesting and

1099
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:46,760
that tension is still alive.
So there's certainly threats to modern

1100
00:50:46,761 --> 00:50:48,350
liberal states going on around the
world.

1101
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,960
So what were the trials in Berlin?
Uh,

1102
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,410
there was a trial in Hamburg and I was
going back and forth from Berlin.

1103
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,800
It was 10 guys from Somalia who I tried
to hijack a cargo ship that belonged to

1104
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:01,580
a,
um,

1105
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,640
a German ship ship company that was
based in Hamburg A.

1106
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,710
I think they were overpowered by the
Dutch navy,

1107
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,900
but the Dutch handed him over to the
Germans.

1108
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,120
In fact the Dutch said,
okay,

1109
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:17,720
we'll do this as long as we don't have
to try them because everyone knew from

1110
00:51:17,721 --> 00:51:20,570
the outset that there was going to be a
problem.

1111
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,550
Uh,
trying Somalis will.

1112
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,610
In what way?
Um,

1113
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,210
in Europe in general,
but especially in Germany,

1114
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:34,211
I think there's a actually a law against
shipping them back to Somalia because

1115
00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:37,240
it's considered not a safe place.
Um,

1116
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,200
for them,
for them,

1117
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,920
even for them.
And I think that's nuts.

1118
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,130
Once they were convicted,
I think they should have been deported

1119
00:51:43,131 --> 00:51:45,350
after they served their time.
That's so bizarre.

1120
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,330
But,
but if they were shipped back to

1121
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:48,770
Somalia,
how would they be treated?

1122
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,360
Like what is the government like in
Somalia?

1123
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,570
And good question sanely corrupt.
I asked some of my parents about that.

1124
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:55,630
It is corrupt.
It's a,

1125
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,770
it's either corrupt or nonexistent.
So the,

1126
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:02,360
the government is Somalia are focused
around Mogadishu and it just doesn't

1127
00:52:02,361 --> 00:52:04,760
have that much power in the provinces.
And I was in one of the,

1128
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,050
one of the provinces and because the
provinces don't get a whole lot of money

1129
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:11,360
from Mogadishu so that they run their
own businesses,

1130
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,490
wins in some cases,
piracy.

1131
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,640
Um,
I asked one of my guards what would

1132
00:52:16,641 --> 00:52:21,641
happen if a pirate went and got thrown
into jail and some of the country and

1133
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:24,370
then came back and tried to,
you know,

1134
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,560
set up friendships again with his old
pirate buddies or whatever,

1135
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:29,420
you know.
Would he be killed?

1136
00:52:29,421 --> 00:52:30,980
Who would he be in,
in dangerous?

1137
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,430
No,
no,

1138
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:34,460
no problem.
Probably what you were back in.

1139
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,790
No problem.
Yeah.

1140
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:37,893
Yeah.
I mean,

1141
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:42,930
is there any sort of punishment for,
for them when they get back to Somalia?

1142
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,490
Was there any penal system or a
potentially there is.

1143
00:52:46,491 --> 00:52:48,350
Yeah.
So they're not considered a crime?

1144
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,550
There are.
Yes,

1145
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:50,440
it is.
So there,

1146
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:54,680
there are laws on the books,
especially in the regions and even

1147
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:56,640
prisons for pirates.
Um,

1148
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,920
the problem is that clan relationships
are a lot more important than newly

1149
00:53:00,921 --> 00:53:02,280
written laws.
Um,

1150
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:06,170
and so even prior to go to jail,
this was true about one boss.

1151
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:08,240
In my case,
I'm might cut out again.

1152
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:10,620
So this guy,
this guy who was a pirate Boston,

1153
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:14,990
my case wound up in jail while I was
still captive for one month in Mogadishu

1154
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,600
and wound up walking.
Wow.

1155
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,890
Yeah.
And he was captive for piracy I think

1156
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:26,100
for having weapons that the government
didn't expect to see in one of his

1157
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:26,934
houses.

1158
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:32,870
So a is something off to the side,
but it's this really sketchy system of

1159
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,520
bartering and payoffs and let's.
Oh,

1160
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,150
you know,
and who you're related to.

1161
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,970
And the,
there are other prisons for,

1162
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,100
you know,
low ranking pirates and Puntland and

1163
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:47,960
also in Galkayo where I was,
um,

1164
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,550
it's a crap shoot.
How much time those guys are going to

1165
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:53,970
spend in jail.
And what happened with the people in

1166
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:58,650
Germany.
They got a total of seven years I think,

1167
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,020
or an average in Germany,
in Germany.

1168
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:03,150
And then what happened when they were
released?

1169
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,700
Nothing.
Wow.

1170
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,950
Yeah.
That's a whole separate story,

1171
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:11,190
which I haven't even started.
Started to address,

1172
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,800
but as it turned out,
a few of them went back to Somalia.

1173
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,110
Anyway.
It probably went right back into the

1174
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:21,111
business a well or something else.
No illicit or profitable or whatever.

1175
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:25,290
Yeah.
And there's a wide variety of people

1176
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:26,280
that they target.

1177
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:29,220
They target people and individual
crafts.

1178
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:32,490
The target large boats,
commercial vessels.

1179
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:33,280
Yep.
They,

1180
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,580
they did all of that.
I mean,

1181
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:37,740
in fact,
I met hostages from all of those from

1182
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,780
the whole range.
So somebody hostage.

1183
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:41,610
Did you meet over the two years and
eight months?

1184
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,790
A total of 30.
So the,

1185
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:47,160
the crew on the fishing ship,
the tune of vessel was 28.

1186
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:51,520
And then I met [inaudible] fishermen,
the two guys from the Seychelles.

1187
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,660
We're small time.
So they weren't just on a small craft.

1188
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:58,710
Would it say shells in the Seychelles is
a chain of islands off Africa.

1189
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:02,500
It's a country that belongs to Africa.
Um,

1190
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,320
but it has a French name.
Um,

1191
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,060
the,
the guys on the tune of vessel,

1192
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,730
I'm more from a,
you know,

1193
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,270
relatively big ship.
The guys from the Seychelles,

1194
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:19,560
we're from a small private craft.
And I was an example of someone captured

1195
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:23,830
on land and these people that were from
the small private craft,

1196
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,580
who were they trying to get money from?

1197
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:29,370
Just anyone who knows them.
Is that how they do this?

1198
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,310
Whoever,
anybody.

1199
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,760
They,
of course they asked from the

1200
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:34,380
government,
but the government doesn't always pay

1201
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,610
the given government.
Yeah.

1202
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:38,800
Just,
it

1203
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,900
just.
The whole system seems so insane that

1204
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:44,000
they've got,
I mean,

1205
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:49,790
the key people for years and years,
but they have just a whole collection of

1206
00:55:51,001 --> 00:55:53,760
them and they're trying to extract money
from people that know them.

1207
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,830
Yeah.
Uh,

1208
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,460
as it turns out,
they're not very good at it.

1209
00:55:56,461 --> 00:55:58,230
So pirates are in the kidnapping
business,

1210
00:55:58,231 --> 00:55:59,550
but they don't always know what they're
doing.

1211
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,130
Um,
the,

1212
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:05,940
the bosses I think got used to.
I'm demanding a lot of money from

1213
00:56:05,941 --> 00:56:10,500
shipping companies and finding out that
if you hold a ship stubbornly for a long

1214
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:11,470
time,
uh,

1215
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:14,490
you got a lot of money from the
insurance company or whatever.

1216
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,500
Um,
I,

1217
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,720
that,
that calculation doesn't work with human

1218
00:56:18,721 --> 00:56:20,730
beings.
So in other words,

1219
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:25,140
everyone else on earth who,
who for a human being expects of the

1220
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:28,590
person's price to go down as the time,
you know,

1221
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,320
wears on and it took a while for parents
to understand that.

1222
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:35,870
Wow.
What is it,

1223
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,590
I mean,
when you're dealing,

1224
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,690
you're dealing with all this,
like what,

1225
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:44,691
what is it like on your psyche when
you're getting two years in two and a

1226
00:56:45,351 --> 00:56:47,280
half years in and you,
you,

1227
00:56:47,281 --> 00:56:49,910
you have some sort of light at the end
of the tunnel.

1228
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,510
What is it?
What does it feel like?

1229
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:54,490
Well,
I didn't know there was light at the end

1230
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,400
of the tunnel,
so I'm two years in.

1231
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:59,320
That's where,
um,

1232
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,970
you know,
it was either forgive the guards or,

1233
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:06,460
or self destruct.
It was also by then I had also

1234
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:13,470
deliberately given let go of having any
kind of hope so that,

1235
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,270
that was the second survival strategy I
had to.

1236
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:19,330
I'm not hope that I was going to get
out,

1237
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:21,040
uh,
because hoping was,

1238
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:25,690
had a downside,
that cycle of hope and despair was

1239
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:30,691
extremely damaging my mental wellbeing.
So the after going through that cycle a

1240
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:32,074
few times,
I'm like,

1241
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:33,550
I have to find a different way.

1242
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:40,240
One of the things that I've gotten out
of travel is I think it is your view of

1243
00:57:42,381 --> 00:57:45,470
the world changes.
When you see the way people are living

1244
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:49,310
in different places you use your
spectrum expands.

1245
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,500
You start recognizing like,
oh,

1246
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:56,450
I might be used to southern California,
but this is not how they do things in

1247
00:57:56,451 --> 00:57:59,120
Ohio.
This is not how they do things in Italy.

1248
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:04,150
This is not.
When you go as far as being a captive in

1249
00:58:06,651 --> 00:58:11,150
Somalia,
your your spectrum is massive.

1250
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:16,250
I mean your view of the world being
entrenched in that life and being with

1251
00:58:16,251 --> 00:58:19,970
those people while they're chewing this
narcotic and carrying around coalition

1252
00:58:19,971 --> 00:58:24,971
of coughs and yelling at each other in a
foreign language and watching fistfights

1253
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,700
and realizing like they don't have
anything either.

1254
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,990
What,
how much has that changed you as a human

1255
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:37,190
being and your,
your view of human life on earth?

1256
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,510
Well,
I think enormously.

1257
00:58:38,511 --> 00:58:40,250
I mean I,
you're right,

1258
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:43,460
it expanded my range and my,
my understanding of,

1259
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:47,930
of what other people think.
They obviously come from a completely

1260
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:52,931
different perspective and Somalia,
not only are they Muslim and African,

1261
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:57,080
but they're also very isolated.
So Somalia as a,

1262
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,950
as a rule has always been difficult to
penetrate for outsiders.

1263
00:59:00,951 --> 00:59:04,880
That was true when Richard Burton was
there in the 19th century to um,

1264
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:08,420
it's,
it's a closed culture and um,

1265
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:13,820
they have their own way of thinking and
also the also the language is not

1266
00:59:13,821 --> 00:59:15,560
related to most other languages you've
heard,

1267
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:17,330
unless you,
you're familiar with languages in

1268
00:59:17,331 --> 00:59:18,890
Ethiopia.
Did you learn any of it?

1269
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:19,873
Yeah,
a little bit.

1270
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:22,563
But,
um,

1271
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:25,720
I resisted learning it from the guards.
I,

1272
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,190
when I was there,
I thought about it like,

1273
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:29,180
um,
in,

1274
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:34,450
in Berlin you realize that a lot of east
Germans when during the communist era

1275
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,460
were taught Russian in school and a lot
of them hated it and I was not in a mood

1276
00:59:40,461 --> 00:59:43,080
to learn Somalia Somali once I was a
captive.

1277
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:45,620
So,
um,

1278
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,090
it was similar to that.
I,

1279
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,390
uh,
I learned a few words,

1280
00:59:50,391 --> 00:59:54,320
but I never had a good teacher.
And of course when I was a journalist I

1281
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:55,550
was relying on translators.

1282
00:59:56,410 --> 01:00:00,130
I would imagine that as a writer that
spectrum,

1283
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,940
the expansion of the spectrum,
although there's no way you would ever

1284
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:09,150
barter it off or bargain to have those
experiences to broaden your spectrum it,

1285
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:14,950
it has to have changed the way you put
pen to paper and view the world and

1286
01:00:16,181 --> 01:00:18,790
your,
your ability to describe things.

1287
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,390
Yeah,
I think you,

1288
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:26,740
you realize that each individual has
certain certain boundaries,

1289
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:31,000
you know,
and certain certain self definitions and

1290
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:35,550
those self definitions can be
the,

1291
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,830
the,
the distance between one individual and

1292
01:00:38,831 --> 01:00:42,820
another can be enormous,
but in some sense also they're

1293
01:00:42,821 --> 01:00:45,090
superficial distinctions,
so yeah,

1294
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:45,390
but

1295
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:49,890
they're inescapable.
Reality is so alien in comparison to

1296
01:00:49,891 --> 01:00:52,230
someone who lives in Bel Air.
Oh,

1297
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,090
absolutely.
Just this,

1298
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:59,120
this,
just that contrast between this world

1299
01:00:59,521 --> 01:01:03,930
that you were so deeply entrenched in
for two in two years and eight months

1300
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,610
like that has got to change the way you
look at human life.

1301
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:12,210
Yeah.
Because the Gulf and wealth is so

1302
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:13,200
enormous.
I mean,

1303
01:01:13,201 --> 01:01:17,090
they can't imagine that the amount of
money it takes to live in Bel Air and,

1304
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:18,540
and the other way around.
I mean,

1305
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:22,290
I think it's very difficult for someone
in California to imagine how little you

1306
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:25,830
can get by on and how close to the
earth.

1307
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:28,840
Some most people on the planet live
either.

1308
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:29,910
There's a statistic

1309
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:34,260
that I read once that I repeat all the
time because it still baffles me that if

1310
01:01:34,261 --> 01:01:37,920
you make more than $34,000 a year,
you're in the one percent of the world

1311
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,701
of the world.
Yeah.

1312
01:01:38,701 --> 01:01:40,020
Possibly.
Yeah.

1313
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:46,310
And that is probably magnified manyfold
in Ethiopia.

1314
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,160
Yeah.
In Ethiopia and Somalia.

1315
01:01:48,161 --> 01:01:49,840
I mean it's,
it's very,

1316
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,370
um,
you know,

1317
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:56,320
in some ways,
although they want money all the time,

1318
01:01:56,321 --> 01:01:58,680
especially if they're criminals.
Um,

1319
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,170
the,
the money that we're used to sort of

1320
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,670
greasing our path through life around
here is just not available.

1321
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,650
It's just not,
not part of the reality.

1322
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,750
What do they do with money when they get
it?

1323
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,190
Well,
it depends if,

1324
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:17,280
if they're pirates,
they splash out on fancy car or fancy

1325
01:02:18,761 --> 01:02:20,220
cars.
Oh yeah,

1326
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,870
no,
I was placed in fancy cars.

1327
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:22,530
I mean,
really?

1328
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,363
Yeah.
No,

1329
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,390
pirates had great cell phones,
um,

1330
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,990
expensive suv,
um,

1331
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,990
weapons that they had bought,
you know,

1332
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,560
from abroad and maybe a weapons bizarre
Mogadishu or something like that.

1333
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:36,210
Uh,
but that's not cheap either.

1334
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,150
A,
they,

1335
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:42,150
they bragged about how the,
the bullets cost like a dollar each one

1336
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:44,490
of them,
I might've been wearing a band of 500

1337
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:45,820
bullets.
Um,

1338
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,400
and the cut is expensive,
so lots of things costs an enormous

1339
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:52,060
amount of money in Somalia.
But if you're,

1340
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,050
you know,
if you're a very ordinary Somali,

1341
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:58,920
Somali,
you're getting by on less than a dollar

1342
01:02:58,921 --> 01:02:59,700
a day.

1343
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:04,700
So there's the ordinary Somalis who are
not criminals or not pirates at least.

1344
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:08,460
And then you asked the majority,
the majority,

1345
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:12,000
and then you have these pirates that are
essentially

1346
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,020
running through the streets and Mercedes
Benz,

1347
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,010
they're like gangsters.
They're like gangsters.

1348
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,810
And that's,
that's actually how one Somali,

1349
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,260
who had some connection to Germany,
I'm described them to me,

1350
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:24,500
you know,
he,

1351
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:27,550
he was wandering around and got kyle
because it was his hometown in some way

1352
01:03:27,551 --> 01:03:30,670
or his ancestral ancestral town.
And he had met some.

1353
01:03:30,671 --> 01:03:32,980
This was before I got captured.
It was like they were,

1354
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,450
you know,
they had wrapped them being from the

1355
01:03:34,451 --> 01:03:35,800
SUV.
Did they really?

1356
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:37,840
American rap.
Who knows,

1357
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,180
who knows?
There's lots of actually good African

1358
01:03:40,181 --> 01:03:41,260
rap.
Really?

1359
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:43,240
Oh yeah.
Senegalese Rep.

1360
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:44,900
have you ever ever heard west African
rap?

1361
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:48,920
Because I love music that I don't
understand the words too.

1362
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,150
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1363
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,240
I can send you some band names.
Please do.

1364
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,560
Yeah.
Although when I write,

1365
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:57,980
I like to listen to the stinky things
that don't understand because I can

1366
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,230
still write and not think about their
words.

1367
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:00,870
Right?
Yeah,

1368
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:05,540
exactly.
When you're around these gangsters and

1369
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:07,700
you do,
you get this sense of like,

1370
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:09,080
Oh God,
like they,

1371
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:11,750
this is,
they need this money like this.

1372
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,530
They want to keep this going.
They're going to need more money funnel.

1373
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,330
This is just a never ending cycle.

1374
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,300
That's,
that's obviously how it seemed.

1375
01:04:19,301 --> 01:04:20,490
Yeah.
I'm the.

1376
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,540
And that's true.
I think some of the guards,

1377
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:26,080
some of the lower ranking and maybe some
of the gentler guards,

1378
01:04:26,081 --> 01:04:27,960
the ones who got along with me,
um,

1379
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,720
did not necessarily want to be gangsters
for the rest of their lives.

1380
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:36,810
So I think for some people the plan was
get a bunch of money and get out,

1381
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,490
you know,
but um,

1382
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:41,890
as a,
as an operation,

1383
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,240
yeah,
it just needed,

1384
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:46,210
there was no limit to the money they
needed or wanted.

1385
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:49,840
And so.
So in the end the real motivation is not

1386
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:51,730
illegal fishing,
but greed.

1387
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:57,670
And do they have any sort of.
It initially started with illegal

1388
01:04:57,741 --> 01:04:58,610
fishing though,
right?

1389
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,490
Yeah,
absolutely.

1390
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:02,630
No.
Do they have any sort of ultimate goal?

1391
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:06,020
Like one day I'm going to retire,
I'm going to have a mansion in the

1392
01:05:06,021 --> 01:05:06,580
hills.

1393
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,770
Yeah.
So I think individually they do and some

1394
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:13,390
bosses get a mansion and a big compound
and live large and then they,

1395
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:17,380
they try and hire younger,
younger pirates and that of thing.

1396
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,470
And the thing about piracy and also
terrorism.

1397
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:24,640
So Al Shabaab is the Al Qaeda aligned
group in Somalia.

1398
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,780
Uh,
Al Shabaab and pirates are the two main

1399
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,480
corporate structures in Somalia.
So in other words,

1400
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:33,460
if you're a young man and you know how
to use a gun,

1401
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:37,510
those are the places you join up with.
If you want to be upwardly mobile,

1402
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:43,290
if you want to impress somebody and get
promotions and make money and,

1403
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:48,670
and marry a wife,
those were the most available options.

1404
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,140
Otherwise,
you know,

1405
01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:54,480
you had scarce jobs.
Maybe some frustrating sheep herding or,

1406
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:58,990
or fishing.
I'm a more interesting jobs in the

1407
01:05:58,991 --> 01:06:02,770
cities but not very many.
And then maybe a pretty well paid you

1408
01:06:02,771 --> 01:06:03,690
end job,
you know,

1409
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,563
if you're lucky.

1410
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:07,090
So that these things are very tempting
for young,

1411
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:11,650
young Somalis and even if the pirate
bosses are no longer capturing ships on

1412
01:06:11,651 --> 01:06:14,680
the water,
it's fallen off quite a bit in the last

1413
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,750
few years.
They've still got other businesses going

1414
01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:17,560
on,
including,

1415
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,870
like I said,
human smuggling and gun smuggling.

1416
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,020
Does anybody have aspirations to get
out?

1417
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,820
Did you,
did you run into anybody that

1418
01:06:24,821 --> 01:06:28,060
understands that the rest of the world,
like there are opportunities to live in

1419
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:32,500
a place where you don't have this kind
of systemic violence and crime?

1420
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:33,610
Yes,
definitely.

1421
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:34,470
I mean,
I think,

1422
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:36,400
um,
they don't necessarily understand the

1423
01:06:36,401 --> 01:06:39,130
rest of the world very well,
but they know that somebody is in

1424
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:41,740
trouble.
And so a lot of people wanted to get out

1425
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,530
and some of the guards to talk to me
about wanting to go to Europe,

1426
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:49,240
but one of them who did,
and I described him in the book,

1427
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,250
he wound up getting married in
Mogadishu.

1428
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:53,110
I found it so I,
you know,

1429
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:57,100
I wound up with a wedding photograph
from him.

1430
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,200
Wow.
So he ended up not going,

1431
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,510
which was smart.
Didn't touch with them,

1432
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:04,730
not exactly.
One guy

1433
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,170
found me on facebook.
And of course Jesus Christ.

1434
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:13,750
One of your captors,
one of the guards know that one of the

1435
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:14,990
gentler guys,
one of the guys,

1436
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:19,460
like when you get a message on facebook
from someone who held a gun to you.

1437
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:24,640
At first I didn't want to answer him,
but slowly I realized that I could get

1438
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:30,341
good information from him on facebook.
We're not friends.

1439
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:32,720
I mean I've explained this before,
but we're not.

1440
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:36,890
We didn't become,
I don't let him into my life on

1441
01:07:36,891 --> 01:07:38,360
facebook,
but no,

1442
01:07:38,361 --> 01:07:39,920
we messaged each other.
It's okay.

1443
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,790
You set limits.
Sorry.

1444
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,630
Still do you.
When you said that you,

1445
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:50,660
you had forgiveness,
that was very important.

1446
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,700
Do you.
Did you express that to him?

1447
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:54,940
Um,
yes,

1448
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,310
at least in my tone.
I mean he's,

1449
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:59,410
he was one of the easiest people to
forgive.

1450
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:00,700
He,
he was,

1451
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,610
he was never obnoxious or,
or violent towards me.

1452
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:06,640
I mean,
except for belonging to this violent,

1453
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,780
violent gang.
I think he was personally never,

1454
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:12,610
um,
you know,

1455
01:08:12,611 --> 01:08:14,560
as obnoxious as some of the other guards
could be.

1456
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:16,100
Did you try

1457
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,760
to communicate to him that the rest of
the world is different?

1458
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,830
Did you try to communicate to him what
it's like where,

1459
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:29,960
where you grew up and then your
experience as a human being is so wildly

1460
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:30,770
different?

1461
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:31,870
No,
it is not.

1462
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,300
That wasn't,
that wasn't our topic of conversation.

1463
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:38,160
Did you ever think of introducing that?

1464
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:43,070
I got some of that information from him,
let's put it that way.

1465
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:46,220
He told me a little bit about his
background and it was military as a

1466
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:48,350
matter of fact,
which I think is typical.

1467
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,150
So in other words,
a lot of them are trained gunman.

1468
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:52,090
Um,
I,

1469
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:56,770
I wasn't anxious to share a lot of
information with them,

1470
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:58,280
but you know,
if he reads my book,

1471
01:08:58,281 --> 01:09:00,370
he'll learn.
It is a lot of personal background in

1472
01:09:00,371 --> 01:09:01,204
the book.

1473
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,230
Wow.
It's,

1474
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:08,560
it's so hard to even imagine.
You know,

1475
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,210
there's some people that tell you things
and you're like,

1476
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,590
oh,
I can kind of imagine that,

1477
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:17,130
but your story is so fucked up.
It's almost impossible to even imagine

1478
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:22,360
so unique in that you grew up in this
incredibly western world,

1479
01:09:22,361 --> 01:09:22,950
this,
this,

1480
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,340
you know,
first world,

1481
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:30,100
you're in Germany and then you go to
Somalia and get captured and stay there

1482
01:09:30,101 --> 01:09:31,480
and alters your reality.

1483
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,473
Yeah,
it did.

1484
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,570
It really did.
And it was,

1485
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:36,520
it's a lot more fucked up than I
expected to be.

1486
01:09:36,521 --> 01:09:37,720
In other words,
I didn't,

1487
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:40,750
you know,
I wouldn't have wished for this.

1488
01:09:40,751 --> 01:09:42,460
I wouldn't have wished for this on my
family either.

1489
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:44,330
I couldn't imagine.
Yeah.

1490
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:50,920
Do you think about Somalia?
Do you think about what,

1491
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:55,480
what it must be like to be a person
that's stuck there that lives there?

1492
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,410
Oh,
I had plenty of opportunity to think

1493
01:09:57,411 --> 01:09:58,030
about that,
you know?

1494
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:59,810
And that's,
that was obviously behind what,

1495
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:02,060
what my guards were doing.
Um,

1496
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:06,080
so that was on my mind quite a lot and
that's,

1497
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,500
that's where he realized that actually
most of the world lives quite poor.

1498
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,320
The Somalia is one of the poorest
countries,

1499
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:16,280
so it's even under the average line for
the,

1500
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:17,870
for the rest of the world.
But I'm,

1501
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:18,980
no,
it's clear that

1502
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,450
most of the world doesn't live like,
like we do in the West.

1503
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,550
What was a day like?
They're like,

1504
01:10:25,551 --> 01:10:28,940
what did you typically do other than be
shackled to sleep and.

1505
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:32,630
Yeah,
well it depended where I was if I was on

1506
01:10:32,631 --> 01:10:35,940
the ship then there was a,
um,

1507
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:39,350
we slept,
I slept in the cabin along with 10 other

1508
01:10:39,351 --> 01:10:42,430
hostages and then we came out to the
deck in the morning and heck,

1509
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:45,830
instant coffee and something for
breakfast.

1510
01:10:45,831 --> 01:10:48,200
And uh,
the food was not bad because it was

1511
01:10:48,201 --> 01:10:53,201
still an operating fishing vessel and we
got piles of rice and basically Chinese

1512
01:10:54,801 --> 01:10:57,500
food from the kitchen as long as
supplies lasted,

1513
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,790
you know,
uh,

1514
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:03,740
once I was on land and then I just woke
up alone under a mosquito tent and

1515
01:11:03,741 --> 01:11:05,250
wondered what to do that day,
you know,

1516
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,560
I had to live in my head quite a bit if
I didn't have paper and pen to write

1517
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:11,000
with,
um,

1518
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:12,830
which I didn't for at least a year and
a,

1519
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,810
I had to sort of right in my head.
I mean,

1520
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:17,580
I,
I actually composed paragraphs in my

1521
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:19,800
head and went through them and memorize
them.

1522
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,220
And eventually I had a two hour routine
in the morning where I just lay,

1523
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:26,220
lay still and went through these words
in my head.

1524
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:30,660
That was one way to keep saying.
So you remembered the individual

1525
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:35,661
paragraphs and you put them in an order.
I was revising books in my head.

1526
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,410
So I would go through and say,
okay,

1527
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:38,970
this needs work,
you know,

1528
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:42,990
might as well get to it.
And then I would compose a paragraph,

1529
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,840
refine it,
memorize it all in my head,

1530
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,320
you know,
I have friends that do comedy that way.

1531
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:52,170
They don't really write only right in
their head,

1532
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,070
but they still call it writing.
And uh,

1533
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,280
I found that interesting.
They said,

1534
01:11:56,281 --> 01:11:57,600
well,
this is the best way for me to

1535
01:11:57,601 --> 01:11:59,490
constantly remember it.
That's interesting.

1536
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:00,031
Yeah.
Well,

1537
01:12:00,031 --> 01:12:01,620
yeah,
I mean that's what I had to do.

1538
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,950
Commit it to memory.
And so you sat down there and when you

1539
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:09,951
were going over the material,
this was a purposeful strategy in order

1540
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:12,930
to keep your sanity,
give herself some,

1541
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:18,020
some order and keep my mind occupied and
when I and I would memorize that.

1542
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,810
And then I also had like a list of names
from the ship to memorize.

1543
01:12:21,811 --> 01:12:24,660
So I had written all their names down
with the proper spellings.

1544
01:12:24,661 --> 01:12:26,460
Right.
I was still optimistic when I,

1545
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,410
when I was on the ship.
Uh,

1546
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:32,730
and so I,
I had an incredibly complex list of

1547
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,590
names from the crewman,
um,

1548
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,800
which I lost and so lost them.
I lost the list between the ship and

1549
01:12:40,051 --> 01:12:44,190
land.
So remembering their names became part

1550
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:48,630
of my morning routine to,
and this is obviously phonetic,

1551
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:50,010
right?
Because you're dealing with Asian

1552
01:12:50,011 --> 01:12:52,390
language.
I had learned to spell them though A.

1553
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:56,970
Luckily when I got out I got a list of
the women's names from the FBI.

1554
01:12:58,850 --> 01:12:59,683
Wow.
Yeah.

1555
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,160
Um,
when did this book come out?

1556
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:05,480
Uh,
it just came out last week and uh,

1557
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,550
um,
it's been a few years in the making.

1558
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,280
Is it difficult to do conversations like
this?

1559
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:12,450
No.
Like I said,

1560
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:14,430
it's,
it's easier now that I've written it,

1561
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:18,060
so I'm fluent with this material now,
but when I first got out I wouldn't have

1562
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,430
been able to talk about it like this.
I would have,

1563
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:24,810
I would've just bumped up.
I wouldn't have known where to start.

1564
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:28,530
What do you anticipate doing once this
is,

1565
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:31,240
once the dust settled and this is,
you know,

1566
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:34,050
for firmly established and you're done
with the promos?

1567
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,490
Uh,
well I'm,

1568
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:37,620
I'm working on a new book.
So,

1569
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:38,790
um,
you know,

1570
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:42,960
the novel moving onto the drone on the
novel and I'm following the story,

1571
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:46,170
a couple of stories in the meantime to
some,

1572
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:49,820
some journalism and I worked for hostage
us at the moment too,

1573
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:53,130
which is a good nonprofit that supports
families

1574
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:59,990
that might have somebody in captivity
somewhere and the US government as it

1575
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:03,870
turns out helps families in,
in really good ways,

1576
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:06,720
um,
but in the ways that they can't,

1577
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:10,470
uh,
in terms of just letting the families

1578
01:14:10,471 --> 01:14:13,270
know what you know,
what to expect and what might be going

1579
01:14:13,271 --> 01:14:15,130
on with her.
There are people,

1580
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,920
a hostage us can step in and help.

1581
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:22,290
I think your story is really important
and I think it's not just important in

1582
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,200
terms of like your,
the,

1583
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:29,290
the fact that you've had an incredibly
deep view of what it's like to live

1584
01:14:29,551 --> 01:14:31,770
there,
but that you,

1585
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,040
you've got your life back.
Yeah.

1586
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:39,770
And in,
in this experience of no hope and sorrow

1587
01:14:40,741 --> 01:14:44,700
and captivity and all the various
struggles that you went through,

1588
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:47,850
you've experienced something that just
very,

1589
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:52,500
very few human beings,
even in the 7 billion people on this

1590
01:14:52,501 --> 01:14:56,040
planet and all their struggles and
trials and tribulations,

1591
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,660
there's what,
what small handful have been held

1592
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:04,980
captive by Somali pirates and then
managed to live

1593
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,320
well there's a network of former
captives and that's what hostage us is

1594
01:15:09,321 --> 01:15:11,270
about.
But you know,

1595
01:15:11,271 --> 01:15:14,300
how many people have been held captive,
owe more than you realize.

1596
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:19,420
But there were several of us are still
alive and so it's the best people for me

1597
01:15:21,861 --> 01:15:25,850
to talk to when I first got out was
other people who've been captive David

1598
01:15:25,851 --> 01:15:29,210
road who was held hostage by the Taliban
when he was working for the New York

1599
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:30,860
Times,
was also on the board of the Pulitzer

1600
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,500
Center when I got captured.
So he followed my story.

1601
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:35,780
Talking to him after I got out was
fantastic.

1602
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:39,070
It was better than a psychologist and I
was aware of.

1603
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,040
He escaped,
you know,

1604
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:42,410
so I was aware of his story when I was
there.

1605
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,390
So we were thinking about each other in
a way,

1606
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:45,830
you know,
and we're friends now.

1607
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:50,860
It's great talking to someone who's been
through it is psychologically the best

1608
01:15:51,021 --> 01:15:51,854
thing

1609
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:53,850
now.
What are the numbers in terms of how

1610
01:15:53,851 --> 01:15:57,020
many people who've been held captive by
the Somalis?

1611
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:57,983
Oh,
biosimilars

1612
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:00,610
currently?
Yeah.

1613
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,160
It's down to about four radian
fishermen.

1614
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:04,540
That's it.
That's it.

1615
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,360
And then a couple of who were actually
captured by pirates and then a couple

1616
01:16:07,361 --> 01:16:08,110
of,
um,

1617
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,270
Kenyon too I think were handed over to a
pirate game.

1618
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:13,600
Um,
so it's much reduced,

1619
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:14,501
you know,
and in fact,

1620
01:16:14,501 --> 01:16:17,020
in the home,
three crew when they got out was the

1621
01:16:17,021 --> 01:16:19,270
last big crew that was being held by
pirates.

1622
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,540
They got out in 2016.
So the pirate era,

1623
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:24,920
you might say is sort of tapering off.
Uh,

1624
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:26,410
but why is that?
Oh,

1625
01:16:26,411 --> 01:16:30,160
because I'm white.
So it was while I was there,

1626
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:34,360
pirate stopped being so active on the
water and I slowly gleaned that from,

1627
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,600
um,
from the BBC or whatever I was listening

1628
01:16:37,601 --> 01:16:39,220
to and I'm like,
fuck,

1629
01:16:39,221 --> 01:16:41,050
I came here and write a story about
pirates.

1630
01:16:41,051 --> 01:16:42,160
And now it's not even a story.

1631
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:47,140
You've become this,
I became the story,

1632
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:48,970
it was not good,
um,

1633
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:54,020
but it fell off in 2013,
maybe even a little earlier,

1634
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:57,760
late 2012,
partly because the boss has shifted

1635
01:16:57,761 --> 01:17:02,680
their focus to other businesses and they
found it less profitable to hold people

1636
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,800
have probably also because of my case.
I'm in my,

1637
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:10,340
my case wasn't moving along and um,
but mainly because,

1638
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:13,610
and this is,
this still has to be true to keep piracy

1639
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:17,600
down.
Cargo ships sail now with,

1640
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:19,100
with our teams,
you know,

1641
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:20,690
contractors.
Um,

1642
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:24,680
and it turns out a spatter of gunfire in
the water can keep a skift from coming

1643
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:25,720
on.
Um,

1644
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,520
that's enough and it should be enough.
And that,

1645
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,970
that's really the main,
the main defense,

1646
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,290
the naval teams that still cruise off
Somalia,

1647
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:37,790
there is the,
it's a very important formality,

1648
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:42,710
but I don't think they practically stop
individual cases the way in our team

1649
01:17:42,711 --> 01:17:43,400
does.

1650
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,740
And there was a lot of fear about that
beforehand.

1651
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:50,760
A lot of fear about putting weapons on a
civilian cargo ship or a merchant ship.

1652
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:54,680
Somebody,
a few people thought there would be like

1653
01:17:54,681 --> 01:17:57,570
an arms race in the water and then,
you know,

1654
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:59,900
pirates would come on with heavier
weapons or whatever.

1655
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:02,720
It turns out not to be the case.
Now,

1656
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,970
what did the bosses shift their
attention to?

1657
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:07,280
Um,
like I said,

1658
01:18:07,281 --> 01:18:11,120
probably some human smuggling drugs and
weapons smuggling,

1659
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:12,170
you know,
they have,

1660
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:15,440
they have portfolios,
they have other businesses and they just

1661
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:19,100
roll it over into something else if,
if piracy becomes too difficult.

1662
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:23,150
And that's what the precautions that the
shipping industry now takes,

1663
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,420
um,
are,

1664
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,510
have been enough to make it too
difficult for the bosses.

1665
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:32,560
Did you take any consideration or do you
anticipate in any way a cure for what

1666
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:34,724
ails them?

1667
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:35,750
Yeah,
in fact,

1668
01:18:35,751 --> 01:18:38,240
that was another idea that sent me
there.

1669
01:18:38,241 --> 01:18:42,700
I wanted to investigate the possibility
of,

1670
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:47,270
of just joining a legitimate business in
Somalia because America went through the

1671
01:18:47,271 --> 01:18:49,190
same cycle three,
300 years ago.

1672
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,710
You know,
we had pirates when we're colonials.

1673
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:54,830
We had pirates,
very savage ones who sailed from the

1674
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:57,830
eastern seaboard out to Africa actually
out to the Horn of Africa.

1675
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,730
And they were very brutal to Muslims,
so it was reversed and um,

1676
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,000
we recovered from it by becoming a
country and becoming responsible for our

1677
01:19:07,251 --> 01:19:08,530
own economy.
Um,

1678
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,670
you know,
what's going on in Somalia now it's a

1679
01:19:10,671 --> 01:19:13,730
lot of illicit business activity,
but as business activity,

1680
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:17,870
you turn it into something listed and
give people jobs.

1681
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:20,330
They're not going to be pirates anymore.
Um,

1682
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:22,760
and there,
there are ways to do that and I think

1683
01:19:22,761 --> 01:19:26,780
slowly people who have power in Somalia
or figuring that out,

1684
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:30,920
but um,
it's still a lot of criminals that have

1685
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:33,110
too much power in Somalia.

1686
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,860
Michael,
I didn't want to touch a book until I

1687
01:19:36,861 --> 01:19:40,630
met you wanted to.
I wanted to somehow or another have a

1688
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:43,820
fresh conversation and get your
perspective on this.

1689
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:47,870
But I think your,
your view of the world is very valuable

1690
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:49,430
and it's just very,
very different.

1691
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:52,130
And I'm so happy that you got out and so
happy.

1692
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:56,390
I'm so happy he wrote this book and I
can't wait to check it out.

1693
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:58,880
It's available now.
The desert and the sea.

1694
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:01,470
And just thank you.
Thank you for being here.

1695
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:02,640
Really,
really appreciate it.

1696
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:03,420
Thanks for having me on.
