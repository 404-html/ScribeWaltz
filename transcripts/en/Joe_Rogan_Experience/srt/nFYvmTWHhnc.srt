1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,240
Four,
three,

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,160
two.
Welcome back.

3
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:13,480
John Doe.
What's happening baby?

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,630
It's good to be here.
It's good to see you,

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,640
man.
We were just talking about Chris 

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:20,640
Cornell.
We uh,

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,130
found out last night at the comedy store
that he died and then this morning and 

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,630
found out that he hung himself.
Just fuck.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,230
It's,
it's hard to even comprehend.

10
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:32,230
How do you comprehend that I'm,
I'm living in a parallel universe.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,940
Doesn't make any sense.
Like how could someone like,

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,940
you know,
it's easy on the outside looking in like

13
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:41,941
I like that,
but you'd like that guy was one of the 

14
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,671
best ever.
Like how does a guy like that even want 

15
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:45,730
to kill himself?
How does the lead singer of soundgarden.

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,270
To me,
it just really kind of reveal.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,840
So the complexities of human life.
Exactly what you're saying.

18
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:56,410
To have a guy that is at the pinnacle of
his skill,

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,040
the Pinnacle of fame,
the pinnacle of money,

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,740
and for him to say,
you know what?

21
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,080
Not gonna do it anymore.
Yeah.

22
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:10,081
I don't,
I don't know what was going on in his 

23
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:10,081
head.
Obviously.

24
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:13,380
Who knows if he was on medication,
if he had some sort of issue health 

25
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:13,380
issue,
who knows?

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,530
I mean,
I would never speculate,

27
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:17,170
but it just,
I don't understand.

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,110
I mean,
again,

29
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:21,870
I don't know his life,
but I couldn't even comprehend it.

30
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:23,390
I can't even imagine it.
Well,

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,690
that's one of the really hard things 
when you start talking about suicide for

32
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:31,360
people that for someone like me and 
I've,

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,440
I haven't had suicidal thoughts.
Right.

34
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,470
So when you,
when you go from that to somebody that 

35
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:39,470
not only has the thoughts but then goes 
ahead and executes it,

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,060
it's very hard to comprehend.
Yeah.

37
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,770
I've met people that have done it 
before.

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,250
I've met.
I have added a few friends that have 

39
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:49,250
done it.
I just have never understood it.

40
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,040
I don't get it,
but I don't know them.

41
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,490
You know what I mean?
Everybody's got their own unique mindset

42
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,620
and just,
you know,

43
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:56,640
what's really crazy,
man,

44
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,800
I read this statistic the other day 
about suicide,

45
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,780
that people in poor neighborhoods are 
far less likely to kill themselves.

46
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,630
People that are in the struggle.
Yeah.

47
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,340
Well,
I actually believed that because they're

48
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:09,800
fighting for something.
Yeah,

49
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,660
and someone that's already got 
everything and then there,

50
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,670
then they end up with no drive with no 
goal and nothing left to achieve and so 

51
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:23,061
then all the sudden they're just staring
at the mirror without anywhere else to 

52
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:23,061
go.
You know,

53
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:26,280
and I'm not talking about Chris Cornell 
in particular,

54
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:31,281
but for some people I know one of the 
things that happens is that when they 

55
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:33,990
become very successful and they're still
not happy,

56
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,810
then they get hopeless.
They just feel like,

57
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:39,960
well I have everything and yet I'm 
fucking miserable.

58
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,490
You know,
I have a nice big house.

59
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:44,580
I drive this fancy car and I still am 
miserable.

60
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,160
Like there's no hope like this life is 
meaningless.

61
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,240
I don't even know what to say to that.
I don't know what to say to be honest 

62
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,240
with you.
When you hear you hear that,

63
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,060
you just don't even know what to say to 
that.

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,440
You know,
one thing that,

65
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,960
why I don't understand it,
I like struggle.

66
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,430
I like.
I think it's important.

67
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,720
I know there's no doubt about that.
There's no doubt about having something 

68
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:05,950
that you're striving for some goal and 
like you just said,

69
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:08,860
when you own all those goals had been 
achieved and now you're sitting there at

70
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:11,530
the top of the mountain and you now you 
don't feel happy.

71
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,650
What do you do?
Just pick up a fucking Hobbie man.

72
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,050
Find something you suck at and get 
better at it.

73
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,970
I mean,
that seems so simplistic,

74
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,560
but,
um,

75
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,140
uh,
you know,

76
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,900
I just,
you and I are,

77
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,600
we shared this a very important part of 
our lives,

78
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:29,710
which is a intense exercise indeed.
And I think that,

79
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,830
you know,
I go to your instagram almost every day 

80
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:34,830
to look at your watch.
It's hilarious.

81
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,511
If you go to Jockos instagram,
it's a fucking timex watch 

82
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,650
advertisement,
but it's all at ironman watch at 4:30

83
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:43,240
in the morning,
the occasional 3:30.

84
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,780
This motherfucker is up at 3:30
and you know,

85
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,820
and you working out like this is fucking
Harry gorilla arm at a Timex ironman 

86
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,990
triathlon watch.
But that's what's up man.

87
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,040
That's what's up.
I mean,

88
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,230
just fucking doing it,
getting out there and struggling.

89
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:01,810
And then once you do do that,
here's the thing,

90
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:02,320
like,
you know,

91
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,850
like a friend of mine said that I was 
uh,

92
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,650
I was saying something about you come on
the podcast and he goes,

93
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:10,390
can that do take another picture?
I was fucking watch.

94
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,380
I go,
I will be,

95
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,600
takes a picture of his watch everyday 
until he dies.

96
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,310
I go,
it's important.

97
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,100
It's important.
It's,

98
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,200
it's sort of in a lot of ways,
it's symbolic of what we're talking 

99
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,200
about.
Like,

100
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,120
no,
it's not fun to look at your watch every

101
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:25,360
day,
but you fucking do it every day.

102
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,860
Like that's what's important.

103
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,270
Yeah.
And I actually,

104
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,390
early on I had someone say something 
along the lines of,

105
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,700
on social media,
on instagram or on twitter,

106
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,420
you know,
oh,

107
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,030
you're just going to post another 
picture you're watching.

108
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,630
I was like,
unfollow me,

109
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,940
just don't follow me.
It's no big deal.

110
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:41,710
I'm not making you do it.
And,

111
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,900
and now it is kind of turned into 
something where I'm doing it everyday 

112
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:46,960
regardless of anything else in the 
world.

113
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Fuck them.
I like looking at your watch.

114
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,560
I want to know when I get up at seven 
and I think I'm getting up early.

115
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,660
You've been up for hours.
You already done work now.

116
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,000
I like it.
I think it's a,

117
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,670
it's,
but it is a lot of ways.

118
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,920
It is symbolic of what we're talking 
about.

119
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,300
It's the struggle.
Yeah.

120
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:04,910
And you know,
you know,

121
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,910
who doesn't complain about and I always 
make this point too.

122
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,910
There's like a,
a single mom somewhere in the valley 

123
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,930
here that's working three jobs that's 
getting up at 3:30

124
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:18,931
in the morning so she can go work as a 
waitress somewhere before she's got her 

125
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:20,020
other day job that she's got to go 
through so she can feed her kids.

126
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,020
I get up almost as a luxury at this 
point.

127
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,570
I mean I'm,
I'm a retired guy from the,

128
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,750
from the military,
so I can kind of get up whenever I want.

129
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,210
I get up early as a luxury sort of.
But you also get up because that's who 

130
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,200
you are.
Yeah.

131
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:40,201
And I get up because it is,
it is a way to maintain discipline in 

132
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:43,441
life for sure.
The kit that stone out and sharpen that 

133
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:46,531
blade every morning show.
It's the grind that sharpens the acs.

134
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:49,150
Indeed just no other way.
There's no other way.

135
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:51,850
And I don't want to say that this would 
have saved Chris Cornell or anybody else

136
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,240
that did it.

137
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,240
I'm not saying that,
but I mean for some people out there 

138
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,670
that aren't feeling good man,
if you just fucking struggled more,

139
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,530
you get over that struggle,
you feel better.

140
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:05,531
It sounds so simplistic,
but I swear by it I felt shitty myself 

141
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,480
and then force myself to workout and 
then after I get out of there,

142
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:11,720
I'm like 100 percent fucking 40 percent 
guarantee and you know,

143
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:12,830
actually I had,
I had,

144
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,860
you know,
I had Tim Ferris come on my podcast and 

145
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:17,860
when he came on he was like,
Hey,

146
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,371
I don't know if I'm the right kind of 
guests for your podcast because you 

147
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:23,811
know,
my podcast is like about war and death 

148
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:23,990
and killing and all that stuff.
And so,

149
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:28,991
you know,
tim's are about being better and stuff 

150
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:28,991
like that.
So it's easy to raise your voice.

151
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:29,790
Yeah,
that's Tim.

152
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,890
Tim's Tim's podcast is about improving 
yourself and mine was about war and 

153
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,250
genocide and horrible things and he said
to me,

154
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:37,730
you know,
hey,

155
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,250
I don't know if,
if I come on the podcast but you know,

156
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,840
maybe I'm not the right type of guest or
whatever,

157
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:42,230
and I,
and I,

158
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,790
and I wrote back to him and I said,
hey man,

159
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,100
you know,
you've been through some dark stuff in 

160
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,531
your life because he wrote a blog post 
years ago about him being suicidal and 

161
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:52,520
him contemplating and planning commit 
suicide.

162
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,990
This is Tim Ferriss.
Did he really?

163
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,090
Yeah,
he went through a full motions.

164
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,330
Got Typical Tim ferriss methodology.
What did he do?

165
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:04,331
He went to the library and got a whole 
bunch of books on killing yourself and 

166
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:05,240
then did the research on how he was 
going to do it and planned it all.

167
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,940
And then when was this,
how long ago he was going,

168
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:11,230
he was like just done with college and 
so I mean,

169
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,710
what does that,
what is he 35 or something.

170
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:16,940
So maybe it's he's 15 years ago and he 
was under all this pressure,

171
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:21,941
you know,
he was an ivy league guy and he was 

172
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,761
trying to finish school,
but then it wasn't working out and it 

173
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:24,761
was just problematic.
And so he started saying to myself,

174
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:25,640
okay,
well how am I getting out of this?

175
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,110
Well,
there's one way to get out of it.

176
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,050
And luckily he didn't do it,
but when he came on,

177
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:35,051
you know,
that's what we talked about and what he 

178
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:35,051
said,
you know,

179
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:36,140
as he was making recommendations from 
again,

180
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:38,780
from a guy who's been there was like,
hey,

181
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:40,040
if,
if you're trapped in your,

182
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,720
in your mind and you're starting to feel
that way,

183
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,830
go do something physical.
Get in your body,

184
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:48,831
you get out of your mind the same thing 
you're saying it when you're feeling 

185
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:48,831
bad,
when you're feeling down,

186
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:51,050
go out and swing a kettle ball around 
and you will feel better.

187
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,580
Yeah.
This is just too much.

188
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:57,610
For some people especially,
they're just experiencing way too much 

189
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,180
pressure and that pressure.
A lot of times it's just a,

190
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,600
an imbalanced and perspective and some 
of it's in like a,

191
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,340
I was talking to this,
mom wants,

192
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,980
her daughter does gymnastics with my 
daughter and we were talking about um,

193
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,330
kids killing themselves where she used 
to live.

194
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,690
She still live in one of the really 
wealthy tech areas outside of San 

195
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,430
Francisco and a bunch of kids that went 
to school with her daughter that were 

196
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,430
like 15,
16.

197
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,260
We're jumping off bridges and shit.
Like it was a,

198
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,670
uh,
like an epidemic and they were trying to

199
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:30,671
figure out what the fuck is going on.
And they're literally calling it 

200
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:33,970
Affluenza.
That these affluent kids and their 

201
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,820
families are literally worth a billion 
dollars.

202
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:35,360
You know,
I mean,

203
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:39,020
everybody's super rich and they're 
having this insane pressure.

204
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:44,410
It like before high school and in high 
school to be an Ivy League schools and 

205
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:44,780
to get four point,
oh,

206
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,090
and they're fucking,
they're not having any fun and they're 

207
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,330
not experienced in life and they don't 
have any hope.

208
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:55,331
And their parents are all on fucking 
pills and they're just killing 

209
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:55,331
themselves.
And as you said,

210
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:57,900
it really is a piece of perspective 
because if you think about,

211
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,140
think about some when you watched one of
your buddies go down the downward 

212
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,140
spiral,
maybe it's not the suicide,

213
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,910
but whether it's drug addiction,
a lot of times some female,

214
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,260
the girlfriend,
the ex wife,

215
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:10,120
we'll just take them on the downward 
spiral and there's there,

216
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,460
they can't get out of it.

217
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,350
And if they were to step back,
if they were,

218
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,590
if it was you and your buddy watching 
one of your other friends go down this 

219
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:18,590
path,
they go,

220
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:18,590
oh my God,
I can't believe he's doing that.

221
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,890
That's crazy.
But when you're in that spiral,

222
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:21,210
people get caught in that and they 
can't.

223
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,790
They can't get the perspective of what 
it looks like from the outside.

224
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,390
It's hard for people to break momentum 
to momentum.

225
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:28,770
That's good.
Momentum or momentum.

226
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:30,120
Momentum is bad.
Momentum.

227
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,420
When I get a,
like when I get on a good groove of 

228
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,151
working out all the time,
I feel it like after I'm done working 

229
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:38,151
out,
I'm like,

230
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:38,820
I can't wait to get in there again.
I can't wait to work out again.

231
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:44,030
That's the good momentum,
but then there's that bad momentum like 

232
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,210
you get injured or something like that 
and you can't do anything for a couple 

233
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:47,970
of weeks and then to try to get that 
kickstart,

234
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:49,360
that meant motor up the end.

235
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,090
It's hard to get momentum.
I've caught some flack for saying that 

236
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:59,801
there was these big science experiments 
or something in the and they said that 

237
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:02,760
willpower dissipates throughout the day 
and the more decisions you have to make,

238
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:05,850
the weaker you get throughout the day,
and I think that's bs.

239
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,940
I agree with what you're saying,
which is when you wake up in the 

240
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:10,940
morning,
you'd get a good workout.

241
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,840
You don't lose willpower,
you actually build it.

242
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:13,890
You feel better,
you feel stronger,

243
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:15,570
and then at lunchtime you you're not 
saying,

244
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:20,610
hey,
where's the pizza and where's the 

245
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:20,610
donuts?
No,

246
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:20,610
at lunchtime you already worked out.
You feel good.

247
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:20,610
You're like,
hey,

248
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,030
where's the.
Where's the steak?

249
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:26,031
Where's the protein?
And that carries throughout the day as 

250
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:27,870
opposed to exactly what you're saying,
which is when you sleep in,

251
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,900
you skip your workout.
All of a sudden the donuts are starting 

252
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,781
to look pretty good and then the next 
thing you know it's pizza and then we 

253
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:35,781
get home at night.

254
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:39,140
You're just watching TV and that can 
continue on for days and then days 

255
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,981
turned into weeks and then the next 
thing you know you're fat and out of 

256
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:42,981
shape.
Yeah.

257
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:43,620
And then on top of that,
if they did do that study,

258
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:48,621
like really I want to know what those 
people were eating because that's a big 

259
00:10:48,621 --> 00:10:52,101
factor too because there's a lot of 
people that are eating shit food and 

260
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:52,740
then by the end of the day your body's 
in a crisis,

261
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,530
you're body's just processing all this 
bullshit.

262
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,760
Yeah.
And people asked me that too.

263
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:57,360
They go,
you know,

264
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,380
how much do you sleep?
First of all,

265
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:00,210
I could ask all the time.
So I go to bed around 11.

266
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,500
I woke up,
wake up around 4:30

267
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:02,640
every day,
so that's five and a half hours.

268
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,430
Sometimes I sleep more than that.
Sometimes I go to bed at 10,

269
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,060
10,
30,

270
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:06,450
11.

271
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,060
Sometimes I stay up later.
But when the person says to me,

272
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:09,540
Oh,
you know,

273
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,010
I can't do that,
I feel horrible.

274
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,060
How can I feel better?
And I.

275
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,010
my first question is like,
well,

276
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:14,430
what are you eating?
What are you eating?

277
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,340
Because if you're eating cheetos and 
chocolate chip cookies for lunch,

278
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,630
there's no way you're going to feel 
good.

279
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:20,430
And I don't care if you slept 12 hours 
the night before.

280
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,510
Yeah,
that's a,

281
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,400
it's a giant factor.
And if you're eating a big like bullshit

282
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:30,120
lunch filled with nonsense,
like your body's got to process all that

283
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:31,350
stuff,
and so the end of the day,

284
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:32,730
yeah,
you're going to lose your willpower.

285
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,620
So like when 5:00,
6:00

286
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,730
rolls around,
you're going to be tired.

287
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,490
But if you have a healthy lunch and you 
know you're,

288
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:44,491
you're properly fueled.
And then you also have positive people 

289
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:47,871
in your life.
Everyone's motivated by the end of the 

290
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:47,871
day,
you're going to feel good.

291
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:51,260
Like say if you're,
if you're doing Jujitsu with a bunch of 

292
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,260
other people that are doing Jujitsu,
everybody's enjoying it.

293
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,500
You're looking forward to that 6:30
class.

294
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,340
Everybody's fired up.
You get out of work.

295
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:55,480
You fucking pumped,
man.

296
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,780
What you do when you get out of work,
you're filling up with water and trying 

297
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,961
to get some electrolytes in you because 
you know you're going to get out there 

298
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:06,151
on the mats and you got to sweat it out 
and the thing you've got to do too is 

299
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:07,330
when you get done with work and it was a
grind and you didn't get.

300
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,370
You ate crappy food and whatever 
happened happened and you got yelled at 

301
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,840
by your boss or whatever,
and they're real easy decision has to be

302
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,160
like,
I'm not going to go try it tonight.

303
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Those the night you got to train because
that is going to kick you back onto 

304
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:20,400
track real quick.

305
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,820
When you get in there and you see your 
boys and they're getting ready to tear 

306
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,851
you up on the mats and that's going to 
get you on track as opposed to going 

307
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:27,550
home and watching TV,
which isn't gonna do anything for you.

308
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,380
Yeah,
and if it's not anything,

309
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,350
whenever the fuck you thing is just go 
and do it.

310
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,360
Just force yourself to do it.
And if you feel like shit because you 

311
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,121
ate lunch,
then your lunch was filled with 

312
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:39,121
bullshit.
Well then,

313
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:40,450
hey dummy,
don't eat shitty lunch tomorrow,

314
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,830
tomorrow.
Try a nice salad,

315
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,920
a salad with some salmon,
and see how you feel.

316
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:45,550
Then you're like,
hey,

317
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:47,910
I feel way better today at 6:00.
Duh.

318
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,990
Yeah.
Now your decision making will be better.

319
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:52,930
Like people don't understand how 
significant it is.

320
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:54,880
Like all these little decisions,
they,

321
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,910
those are the.
That's the path for the rest of your 

322
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,910
existence on earth.

323
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,850
And if you decide to go to fucking 
cheetos,

324
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:02,800
chocolate chip cookie route,
you're.

325
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:06,850
If you're just making a shit path,
you're carving your fucking path through

326
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:09,780
broken rocks and glass.
And it's not the way to go.

327
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,790
There's no doubt that the,
the life change decision isn't one big 

328
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,640
decision that you make.
It's all these little tiny decisions.

329
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:16,350
It's,
you know,

330
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,210
having a salad instead of cheetos.
That's,

331
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,500
that's,
that's what it is on a daily basis.

332
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,950
And if you think about that and then you
just make the right decision on those 

333
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,560
little things,
that's where,

334
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,640
that's where the change is reaching your
refrigerator.

335
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,550
You see the cocacola right next to the 
water,

336
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,330
just like to grab that water,
just do it and no,

337
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:36,100
you don't want to put.
Just do it and you'd be like,

338
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:37,600
I fucking did it.
I grabbed the water.

339
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,810
Listen,
water doesn't taste good compared to 

340
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:42,810
coca cola.

341
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,130
If your body is craving that heroin of 
Coca Cola,

342
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,550
but the reality is if you were out in 
the desert and you saw a cold bottle of 

343
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,141
water,
you wouldn't be so excited for that 

344
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:55,141
water blood.
Oh,

345
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:55,570
it would be the most delicious thing 
ever.

346
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,860
When you're at a restaurant,
you're like,

347
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:57,910
oh,
you're going to eliminate,

348
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,230
oh,
you don't want a soda.

349
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:00,190
I,
I want some.

350
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:05,340
Some mouth pleasure,
and if you've ever been truly thirsty 

351
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,491
before,
like in the desert and you haven't had 

352
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:08,491
water or you didn't bring enough water 
and you're really thirsty,

353
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:12,370
you see coke isn't even appealing at 
that nice nasty you can get to fill.

354
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:17,371
It really is.
You get in that mode where you've been 

355
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:17,371
truly thirsty,
which I've been before.

356
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:18,130
You know,
just not like I was going to die,

357
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:22,890
but I've been close to getting some sort
of a heat stroke scenario happening and,

358
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,870
and then got to extreme pump the water,
drink the water,

359
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,120
and that's the most beautiful thing in 
the world.

360
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,120
And you don't have water and you get it.
I bet more so even if you get it from a 

361
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,550
stream and then pumping it through a 
filter and you know,

362
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,530
just getting it right out of the earth.
So good.

363
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,840
Oh,
so what?

364
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:40,120
You're supposed to have folks where I 
think people are supposed to struggle.

365
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,180
I think there's,
there's a part of us that longs for the 

366
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,911
old times when we were just some sort of
primitive monkey people running away 

367
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:48,940
from animals.
So there's that.

368
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,950
That's still in our DNA.
There is no doubt that you have an 

369
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:53,950
instinct.
I mean that's why we play sports,

370
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,701
right?
You got to play sports because you want 

371
00:14:57,701 --> 00:14:57,710
to compete with people and,
and look at the rise of the UFC.

372
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,600
Why is that?
Because that's the most primal sport you

373
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,790
can possibly come up with is I'm going 
to fight you.

374
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,850
That's what we're going to do in a cage.
So why is that so popular?

375
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,260
We still have that instinct that we want
to.

376
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,460
We want to fight and we want to 
struggle.

377
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:09,250
We want to survive.
You know,

378
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,260
Dana White and I have talked about this 
so many times that it transcends every 

379
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,800
language.
Like cricket is so giant in England,

380
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,240
right?
And then India,

381
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,170
try putting that shit on TV in America 
will be like,

382
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,190
good pitch.
Get that fucking stupid paddle game on 

383
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,220
TV.
What the fuck are you doing?

384
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,010
We don't even know what's going on.
Or conversely,

385
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,230
baseball,
you played baseball to some country that

386
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:31,400
doesn't accept baseball.
They're like,

387
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:33,440
what is this nonsense?
It's takes forever.

388
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Knowing the real sport of MMA like is 
not.

389
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,380
I mean it is unquestionably,
it's a sport and there are rules,

390
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,140
but it transcends.
You know what's happening.

391
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,960
You might not understand the ground that
much when,

392
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:51,961
when submissions,
but when you see a guy turning red 

393
00:15:51,961 --> 00:15:53,110
because the other guys behind him 
choking the fucking life out of them,

394
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,870
you get it.

395
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,640
You see what's happening.
You understand it.

396
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,900
That's another cool thing.
If you ever,

397
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,760
you ever teach kids Jujitsu?
Yeah.

398
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,090
It's so awesome to say no,
you want to put this guy down and that's

399
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,340
all you need to say that they go,
okay.

400
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,140
And then you give them a little,
little,

401
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,470
little tastes of information.
Like if you grabbed their legs and push 

402
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,371
them,
they'll fall down and that's all you 

403
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:17,291
need to tell them.
And then there'll be basically doing 

404
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,380
double leg take downs instinctively.
And it's savage.

405
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,850
It's beautiful.
It is beautiful.

406
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:20,790
But you can't do that with,
you know,

407
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,000
with a regular sport like baseball.
Okay.

408
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:24,890
What you're going to do is you're going 
to have this guy throw the ball to three

409
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:28,700
times every time you swing up to Mrs.
so that goes to him and he was,

410
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,600
how's that work?
No.

411
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,040
Yeah.
Well it's also,

412
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,100
there's something feels good about like 
choking somebody,

413
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,450
you know,
it's just,

414
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:37,730
there's something about it,
like even if you're not hurting him,

415
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,720
I mean it just feels good is it feels 
like you're supposed to do it.

416
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,310
Maybe it's just you and I,
you know,

417
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:50,330
I think anybody,
I think anybody that tries it and gets 

418
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,951
that,
that's why that's why did you choose 

419
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:53,951
getting so popular because you take a 
random person on the street,

420
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:54,680
Male,
female,

421
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,390
10 years old,
20 years old,

422
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,820
40 years old,
you put them on and you say,

423
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:03,821
okay,
when you get them this other person in 

424
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:03,821
this position right here and you get 
their arm around,

425
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:08,020
you get your arm around their neck,
you can kill them or you can accept that

426
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:11,450
you can accept their tap and you can 
have mercy on them.

427
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,150
That's a powerful feeling.
It is.

428
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,080
We know what other things that's 
powerful about it is the two guys can be

429
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:21,980
friends and practice killing each other 
and not even hurt each other like,

430
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,290
like I'm sure you,
you,

431
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:28,291
you've recognized that.
Like I feel better working out with 

432
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:28,291
black belts.

433
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:32,110
I feel safer for sure.
Training with guys that are like super 

434
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,880
high level than I do with even guys that
are like an athletic white belt.

435
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:35,930
It might spazz out and accidentally 
headbutted me.

436
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,550
Yeah,
and I mean I could ask that question all

437
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:38,520
the time too,
is uh,

438
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,590
people say,
Hey,

439
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,930
am I too old to start your Juto I'm 52 
years old,

440
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:44,510
I'm 49 years old and what I tell them 
is,

441
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,220
you're not too old,
you're definitely not too old,

442
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,310
but you need to be smart and one of the 
smartest you need to make is choosing

443
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,740
your training partners and you don't 
want to train.

444
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:57,741
If you're a 52 year old guy that's never
trained before and you're a white belt 

445
00:17:57,741 --> 00:18:01,551
and you're going to get on the mat,
the person you don't want to train with 

446
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:04,440
is the other white belt that's 22 years 
old that's on steroids,

447
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:06,120
that's going to go psycho and he's going
to,

448
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,180
he just,
he just doesn't know how to control his 

449
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,180
body.
Whereas the black belt,

450
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,270
the black belt,
the percentage chance of you being hurt 

451
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:14,780
by a black belt if you're a white belt,
that's just,

452
00:18:14,781 --> 00:18:17,010
you know,
trying is nearly zero,

453
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,960
nearly zero,
zero

454
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,180
if it's a legit blackbelt yeah,
yeah.

455
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:25,181
I teach my kids class sometimes my kid 
takes a mixed martial arts class and the

456
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:30,401
instructor asked me to come in and 
demonstrate one particular type of move 

457
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:33,471
the other day and so I started,
I demonstrated it and we were talking 

458
00:18:33,471 --> 00:18:35,780
about some different positions that are 
important for kids to recognize like how

459
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,480
to make sure you don't get like kids 
were given up their back where they were

460
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:43,481
trying to pass guard.
They were trying to pass guard and they 

461
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:45,941
were pushing down and I'm like,
you never want to turn your shoulder 

462
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:45,941
like that because I had explained to 
them the arm drag.

463
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:50,741
So I'm explaining to these kids to arm 
drag and you see the little brain 

464
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:53,871
spinning man and you see them practicing
on each other and they're laughing and 

465
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:54,160
they're girls,
you know.

466
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,550
So you're watching these eight year old 
girls having the best time,

467
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,760
like choking each other and everything 
and going through these motions.

468
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:05,390
And to me,
I mean I think it's fucking awesome man.

469
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,310
These kids do it all the time.
No one's getting hurt.

470
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:12,420
They're having a great time with each 
other and it's just this primal release 

471
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,600
like let's get all that shit out of 
there and then you can

472
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,530
be civil.
Yeah,

473
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:19,550
well even if there's no Jujitsu 
instruction involved and there's no mats

474
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:23,240
around and you take two kids and you put
them in the yard,

475
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,610
eventually they're going to start 
wrestling with each other.

476
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,190
Boys.
Yeah,

477
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,220
boys for sure.
Yes,

478
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,760
for sure.
I was at a party

479
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,840
once with my kids and these two boys 
started going at it and it neither one 

480
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,020
of them at any training you could tell,
but it's just natural.

481
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:41,170
Like they,
they're getting their hips low and that 

482
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,411
trying to push each other and trying to 
figure it out and neither one of them 

483
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:46,691
knew what to do.
Kind of wanted to go up and start 

484
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:46,691
coaching them,
but they're just playing in the grass.

485
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:46,920
I didn't want.
You know,

486
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,690
it's like,
it's,

487
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,530
it's fascinating to see just natural 
human instincts.

488
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,620
Yeah.
And that's the other thing I've noticed 

489
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,540
in teaching kids Jujitsu is the kids 
that are a little bit more cerebral,

490
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,540
your,
your,

491
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,590
the parents will think,
well,

492
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:01,280
you know,
my son,

493
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:02,510
he's,
he's kind of a nerd.

494
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:04,430
He's kind of a smart kid.
I don't know if he's going to like this,

495
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:09,110
but the opposite is actually true very 
often where the kid that's cerebral,

496
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,170
he'll recognize as soon as you show them
three things,

497
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,630
like you said,
his wheels are turning.

498
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:14,740
He's going to wait a second.
This is,

499
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,740
this is a skill I can learn and if I 
know this that and the other guy doesn't

500
00:20:18,741 --> 00:20:20,150
know this,
I'll be able to beat him.

501
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,920
And so cerebral kids often get into it 
even more than,

502
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,710
than some kid.
That's just kind of a natural bruiser Oh

503
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:32,711
yeah,
that means 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu is 

504
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:32,711
filled with nerds.

505
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:34,460
They're all nerds,
they're assassin nerds.

506
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,140
It's really kind of interesting.
It is.

507
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,590
And,
and you're,

508
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,600
you're,
you're not being facetious when you use 

509
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:42,920
the word assassin nerds,
because you know,

510
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:43,730
this is,
you know,

511
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:48,731
if you go back before you knew Jujitsu 
before I knew you did before I knew 

512
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:50,440
Jujitsu and you know,
all was a big navy shield,

513
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,510
200 pounds,
one of those kids,

514
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:56,140
that's 145 pounds would absolutely have 
destroyed me if we've got new fight,

515
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,040
boom,
take my back,

516
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,000
put me to sleep,
you know what I mean?

517
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,750
I,
I might,

518
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,960
you know,
put up an okay fight and hit him one 

519
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,050
time in the side of the head and then 
he's in on my back and put me to sleep.

520
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,190
That's the reality.
Nerd assassins coming at you strong.

521
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,310
Well,
it is.

522
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,930
It's a complex game of kinetic chest.
I mean,

523
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:16,420
it's more complex than chess because you
know,

524
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:21,421
in chess you've got these different 
pieces and they're restricted in their 

525
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:21,421
movements.

526
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:22,360
Jujitsu's not restricted in its 
movement.

527
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:27,361
And every transition has so many 
different possibilities and so many 

528
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:28,120
different setups are so many different 
times.

529
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:32,470
You get led one way and then just to get
you to defend so that they can establish

530
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:37,471
the second position and they get you to 
defend that so they can establish a 

531
00:21:37,471 --> 00:21:37,690
third position.
Yeah,

532
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,130
and that part of it is is what I think 
really for me,

533
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:47,131
transferred from Jujitsu to not only to 
the battlefield but to life as well 

534
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:51,421
because the big thing in Jujitsu from my
perspective is that you don't go 

535
00:21:51,421 --> 00:21:52,510
strength against strength.
Right?

536
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,280
If I'm,
if I'm trying to choke you,

537
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:57,550
I don't try and choke you overtly.
I don't just grab your neck.

538
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:02,551
No,
I work on your arm and I put pressure 

539
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:02,551
over here and I pass your guard and then
I eventually,

540
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:03,730
while you're thinking about something 
else,

541
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,850
boom,
that's when I grabbed your neck or 

542
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:08,850
that's when I grabbed her arm and that's
what I think on the battlefield.

543
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,490
You know,
you can't,

544
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:13,090
you just don't attack hardened to 
positions of the enemy and in life,

545
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,470
you know,
if you're trying to be a leader,

546
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:15,820
you're trying to step up and lead 
somebody.

547
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:21,300
If you don't just come down and bark 
orders at people because that's not as 

548
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,051
effective as maneuvering and adjusting 
your position and getting in a better 

549
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:29,200
position and then getting that person to
give you what you want instead of trying

550
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:30,310
to take it from them.
Yeah.

551
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:33,460
That's a really important lesson for 
parenthood.

552
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,800
Like you can't just tell kids what to 
do.

553
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,110
Just do it because I told you to do it.
They're like,

554
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:43,111
fuck you.
I'm going to be a hooker and that 

555
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,210
applies not only to kids at your hundred
percent applies to kids,

556
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:51,350
but it applies to adults as well and 
that is people need to understand why 

557
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,350
they're doing what they're doing and you
know,

558
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,680
if I want you to go take down some 
building and capture some bad guy,

559
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,640
I don't go,
hey,

560
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,690
hey joe,
I want you to go take down this 

561
00:22:59,690 --> 00:22:59,690
building.

562
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,470
Once you capture the bad guy,
these are the guys I want you to take 

563
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:01,470
with you.
Here's the route I want you to take in.

564
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,131
Here's the methodology I want you to use
for the clearance because then when I 

565
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:05,230
send you to go do that mission,
it's not your mission,

566
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,240
it's my mission.
I came up with the plan.

567
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,770
You didn't,
so you might be.

568
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:14,100
You might have thought there was a 
better way to do it or you might have 

569
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,100
had a different idea of how to get it 
done,

570
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,550
and now when you go out there and you 
meet some kind of resistance,

571
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:20,551
whether it's an obstacle you didn't 
expect or whether it's some scenario 

572
00:23:20,551 --> 00:23:20,950
that you didn't foresee,
instead of you trying to overcome it,

573
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:22,430
you just blame me.
He just looked at Jocko,

574
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,220
came up with a stupid plan,
and here we are.

575
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:24,820
It's failing.

576
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,080
Forget it.
We're going back.

577
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:27,160
We're not going to carry out the 
mission.

578
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,410
Whereas if I said,
hey joe,

579
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,740
here's what I want you to do,
go figure out the best way to do it and 

580
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,951
now you come up with a plan and now you 
make up all the methodology of how 

581
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:41,551
you're going to get it done and you 
decide who you're going to take with 

582
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:41,551
you.
Now it's your plan.

583
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:45,150
You own that plant and when you go out 
in the field and you meet a little 

584
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:45,150
resistance,
guess what you do?

585
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:45,530
You say,
I'm going to find a way around it.

586
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,280
I'm going to overcome

587
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,280
this.
I'm going to overcome that obstacle and 

588
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,591
to make it happen,
and that's another piece of leadership 

589
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:52,670
and it's the exact same thing with kids.
If you tell your kid,

590
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,980
you know you will get good grades in 
school,

591
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,310
that means nothing to them,
but if you explain to them,

592
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:03,490
Hey,
I would love for you to get good grades 

593
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:03,490
and here's why.
It's going to open opportunities for you

594
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,511
in the future.
It's going to allow you to be able to 

595
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:07,730
outsmart people because you can have 
more knowledge than them and then you're

596
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:09,500
gonna be able to end up making more 
money,

597
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:11,300
which is actually gonna give you more 
freedom in the long run.

598
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:13,070
Instead of doing a job that you don't 
want to do.

599
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:18,490
You explain all those things to a kid is
going to be a lot more successful than 

600
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:18,490
just do what I told you.

601
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,940
Get good grades because I said so.
Now,

602
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:24,941
when you do these conferences where when
you speak it at a businesses and they 

603
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:29,190
bring you in to sort of have these 
leadership meeting,

604
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,350
what,
what would you call them?

605
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,790
Yeah,
their leadership seminars,

606
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:36,910
seminars.
Now when you have these seminars or 

607
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:36,910
these,
uh,

608
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,070
some of the principles that you 
discussed when you talk about.

609
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:37,900
Absolutely.
Yeah,

610
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,500
absolutely.
Because that's another,

611
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:44,501
another big piece of this is that all 
just ideas about interacting with human 

612
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:45,530
beings.
They just don't change.

613
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,680
Like there's a little variance,
but whether you're dealing with kids or 

614
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,591
whether you're dealing with adults and 
whether you're dealing with business 

615
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:55,511
people,
whether you're dealing with soldiers on 

616
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:55,511
the battlefield,
the leadership principles,

617
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:59,621
they don't change and therefore you can,
whether you're trying to get people to 

618
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:04,031
go out and capture and kill a bad guy or
whether you're trying to get them to 

619
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:07,360
build some product and sell it,
the principal's leadership don't change.

620
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,330
You're still trying to get a bunch of 
totally independent people.

621
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Right?
And that's one of the myths we have to 

622
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:16,360
overcome a lot because everyone thinks,
oh,

623
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,060
in the military have just like a robot.
And that's just not true.

624
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,790
Everybody in the military is free.
There are people,

625
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,650
they're people,
they're free thinking people and they're

626
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:26,651
gonna come up with own ideas they're 
gonna have with their own agendas and 

627
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:28,751
they're going to think of ways to do 
things that they think are better than 

628
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:31,811
yours.
So you're gonna have all these 

629
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:33,041
independent free thinkers and you got to
get them onboard with the same plan to 

630
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:36,690
you to go out and execute.
And so it doesn't matter if you're on 

631
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:36,690
the battlefield or in business.
That's what.

632
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,740
That's what you're trying to get done.
And the leadership principles don't 

633
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:41,740
change that.
To me,

634
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:41,930
that's as a person who's never been in 
the military.

635
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,650
That's one of the fascinating aspects of
how it works is like how,

636
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,160
how do you get all these different 
people to follow through on a plan and 

637
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,300
who are the leaders and why did the 
leaders have the right ideas and who 

638
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,620
educates them as to how the have the 
right idea to having the right ideas.

639
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,890
Like I know that a lot of people are 
excited about where the military is 

640
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,761
right now.
Like Tim Kennedy re enlisted and he the 

641
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:06,761
lesson.
Yeah,

642
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:08,390
he resisted because he believes that the
military has support now and look,

643
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Tim Kennedy's believes he was put on 
this earth to kill bad guys and that's 

644
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,570
what he wants to do.
I think I agree with Tim Kennedy.

645
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,520
I think I agree with them too,
for sure.

646
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,140
Obviously he enjoys it.
He's not fucking around me.

647
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,320
He went back in,
he put his money where his mouth is and 

648
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,570
in his eyes that this is,
you know,

649
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,980
this is the way that it should have 
been,

650
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,340
that you should give the military the 
chance to do their job.

651
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,650
That's their idea.
And then other people believe that there

652
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:40,340
should be much more civilian oversight 
and they should be much more,

653
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,190
much more checks and balances before 
things get done.

654
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,110
This is a,
this

655
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,260
is a big debate that's going on today.
Well,

656
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:48,060
I think there's two different things 
that you just talked about.

657
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,220
That is what the military gets told to 
do and how they do it.

658
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,510
And those are two different things.
And I,

659
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,300
I think that yes,
you absolutely,

660
00:26:57,301 --> 00:27:02,301
the civilians should control and do 
control the military by the way they do 

661
00:27:02,301 --> 00:27:06,531
control.
The civilians are undercut or the 

662
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:07,200
military is under controlled civilians 
and yet once you say,

663
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:08,760
okay,
this is what we want to have happen,

664
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:14,510
you need to let the military 
professionals figure out how they're 

665
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:14,510
going to go and make it happen.

666
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,130
Yeah,
that's,

667
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,660
that's where it gets tricky,
right?

668
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Because if you're in like one of the 
things that was explained to me by a 

669
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,370
friend who's navy seal,
he was saying that when something needs 

670
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,521
to get done and you have all these 
people that are telling you how you can 

671
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,210
do it,
how you can't do it,

672
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:36,350
that people that are not in experiencing
combat and don't understand what,

673
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,630
what could or could not go sideways like
to put more problems in place or to put 

674
00:27:42,131 --> 00:27:47,131
more checks and balances in place,
you're actually going to put these 

675
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:47,131
people in

676
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:47,780
danger that that is true.
You should.

677
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,840
Like I said,
if you let the civilians decide what it 

678
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,441
is that needs to be accomplished and 
then the military leaders decide how 

679
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,000
they're going to go ahead and make that 
happen and I mean it goes back to,

680
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,370
goes back to Vietnam,
you know,

681
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,380
there was too much civilian oversight of
what was happening in Vietnam and the 

682
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,440
military leaders were.
They didn't really have the,

683
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,600
the wherewithal,
not even the wherewithal.

684
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,630
They didn't have the free reign to go 
out and try and make things happen the 

685
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:16,630
way they want to do and it ended up in a
big quagmire.

686
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,380
Well,
Vietnam seems like to me,

687
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:21,110
from an outsider to be one of the most 
fucked up wars ever,

688
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:21,950
absolutely.

689
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:27,060
It didn't totally make sense that it was
happening and then now we know that the 

690
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,021
Gulf,
the Gulf of Tonkin was very likely a 

691
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:34,171
false flag and that there was some sort 
of motivation to get there in the first 

692
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:37,291
place and then you're dealing with 
guerrilla warfare for the first time 

693
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:40,201
ever in US history.
Like they didn't exactly know how to 

694
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:40,201
handle this.

695
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,990
No,
we didn't and we didn't adapt very well.

696
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:47,110
To what was happening on the ground,
which is always going to be problematic 

697
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,380
if you have closed minded people in the 
military,

698
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,440
if people are closed mind that you're 
not going to be able to move forward 

699
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,440
against,
uh,

700
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,140
when,
when the battlefield changes and the 

701
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,140
battlefield changes all the time.
I mean,

702
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,140
you can look at Iraq,
Iraq,

703
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,650
the battlefield change drastically from 
this big conventional force that we went

704
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:02,870
up there to fight against Saddam's big 
army.

705
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,130
Well,
once that fell apart,

706
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,160
then what happened?
Now all of a sudden we were facing 

707
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,081
gorillas again and an insurgency and it 
took us several years to change our 

708
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:12,440
strategy from.
We didn't even know what to do.

709
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,540
We're like,
oh my God,

710
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:14,060
you know,
what do we do?

711
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:19,070
There's all these people running around.
What do we do with these all these 

712
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,070
people running around and how do we get 
these people under control and,

713
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,140
and the civilians want us here.
And,

714
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,200
and yet,
if we don't do the right thing now the 

715
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,200
civilians don't want us here.
What do we need to do?

716
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,860
So it took us some time to adjust our 
strategy in Iraq.

717
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,220
And Luckily we had some good leaders 
that that went ahead and made those 

718
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,220
changes.

719
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,450
Isn't it also that when when you're in 
war and the strategy and not the 

720
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,870
strategy,
but the is very clear,

721
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:41,120
like if you fight against Hitler's army 
in World War Two,

722
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,070
but this is very

723
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,870
clear that you're dealing with an evil 
force.

724
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,300
Whereas in Vietnam it's like,
wait a minute,

725
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:47,950
why are we here?
Like what's going on?

726
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,450
Communism.
What's happening?

727
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,570
Extremely,
extremely challenging,

728
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:58,110
no doubt.
And that that is why I've talked about 

729
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,540
this before.
If,

730
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:02,410
if America or any nation is going to go 
to war,

731
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:07,060
you have to decide that this is the most
important thing in the world.

732
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,160
You have to end the wills that I talk 
about,

733
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:11,080
that you have to have to execute this 
war.

734
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,740
You gotta have you gotTa have the will 
to kill people.

735
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,780
And again,
I say this all the time,

736
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,630
no one wants to hear it because it's 
ugly and horrible,

737
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,580
but when you say you're gonna kill 
people in war,

738
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,090
you're not just going to be able to 
perfectly killed just the bad guys.

739
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,690
Civilians are going to die.
It is a nightmare.

740
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,280
Kids,
women.

741
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,290
It's horrible.
It's awful,

742
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,910
and if you think,
oh,

743
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:35,620
I'm going to go to war and we're just 
going to kill the bad guys,

744
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,140
it's not gonna happen in war is too 
complex.

745
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,390
It's just not going to be.
It'd be saying like,

746
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,710
Hey,
I'm going to go and fight in the UFC and

747
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:43,720
I'm not going to get hit.
It's not going to happen.

748
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:45,460
You're going to get hit,
you're going to get bruised up,

749
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:47,890
you're going to get dinged,
and it's the same thing in war.

750
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,620
So you have to have the will to kill 
people.

751
00:30:50,621 --> 00:30:52,630
Of course it's easy to have the will to 
kill the bad guys,

752
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,900
but then you have to accept the fact 
that some innocent people are going to 

753
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,501
die and that is going to be awful.
And then on the other side of the coin 

754
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:02,770
is of course,
if you're going to send people to war,

755
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,890
people,
Americans are going to die and there's 

756
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:07,890
nothing you can do about it.

757
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,460
You have to accept that fact and you 
know,

758
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:14,410
that's why Vietnam was just the ultimate
tragedy and in many respects,

759
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:16,350
because we were killing a lot of 
civilians.

760
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:21,380
We were losing a lot of Americans,
but we weren't progressing the way we 

761
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:21,380
needed to.
It was a nightmare.

762
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,370
I agree with you 100 percent.
What do you think about transparency?

763
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:29,371
Like when the Bush administration 
wouldn't let them take photographs of 

764
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:33,160
coffins and send them home like a lot of
people were really upset because there's

765
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:34,570
a lot of people that felt like,
look,

766
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:39,571
America should know that there's a cost 
to this and they should know that 

767
00:31:39,571 --> 00:31:43,771
there's consequences to these actions,
and they were saying that these 

768
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,880
consequences and knowing about these 
consequences could lesson morale,

769
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:48,340
could lessen support back at home when 
they really need it,

770
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:53,341
and the people didn't really need to 
know this is what they need to know is 

771
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:53,341
we're on the right track and we're doing
well.

772
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:58,710
That's a tough one.
And whether it's the right decision to 

773
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,471
keep the Americans and their beautiful 
bubble that they live in and let them 

774
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:04,621
know that this war is happening,
but you don't have to see the brave 

775
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:05,980
Americans coming home that are 
sacrificed their lives.

776
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,440
And interestingly,
if you remember,

777
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,520
I think it was Tara,
what the battle of when World War II and

778
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,410
for the first time,
so we were,

779
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,870
we needed money to run world war two,
a lot of money,

780
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:21,871
war bonds and all that,
and we were kind of falling behind and 

781
00:32:21,871 --> 00:32:24,961
we needed some money.
And one of the first times that they 

782
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:28,600
released a lot of pictures of American 
dead Americans was,

783
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,690
I think it was the battle of Tarawa.
And there was all these Americans 

784
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,930
washing up on the beach.
I mean marines that had drowned,

785
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,700
got shot.
And it was awful.

786
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,930
But they did it for a reason.

787
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,230
They did it to show like,
hey,

788
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,000
this is real.
This is happening.

789
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,220
We need to put pitch in.
We need money,

790
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,710
we need to save,
save,

791
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,500
meet,
save a oil,

792
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,680
don't use your cars.
We all need to get in for the big win,

793
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,920
right?
And that's the opposite of what we're 

794
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:56,920
talking about when they're saying,
hey,

795
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,671
you're not allowed to take pictures of,
of native Americans that are being 

796
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:00,671
killed.
And you know,

797
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:04,720
I,
I think there should be some level of 

798
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,110
transparency there when you should.
America should see what is happening,

799
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:08,390
what is the cost?
Because it's real easy for Americans to,

800
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,600
to sit there and allow these young kids 
to go overseas and fight and die or be 

801
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,510
wounded,
gravely wounded,

802
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,620
and just to shut those.
Just ignore them because I'm,

803
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,010
I don't care because I'm over here in 
the mall.

804
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,910
No,
maybe we should,

805
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:21,170
uh,
maybe we should not only,

806
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:26,470
you know,
maybe we should not only show pictures 

807
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,280
of the coffins that are coming back,
but maybe we should explore and show the

808
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:33,281
lives that those men sacrificed and who 
they were and what they did and what 

809
00:33:33,281 --> 00:33:36,611
their families are like and their wife 
and kids and mom and dad that they left 

810
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:36,620
behind,
that they gave up.

811
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,170
And why did they give it up?
Because they believed in freedom.

812
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,810
And so now we just going to say,
oh,

813
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,020
that's not happening.
No,

814
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,220
it's happening.
And you need to,

815
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,650
you need to know it.
It is kind of strange,

816
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:50,651
right?
When you think about how little access 

817
00:33:50,651 --> 00:33:50,651
to information people really had back in
world war two,

818
00:33:50,651 --> 00:33:54,611
they were counting on the news and they 
were counting on newspapers and now 

819
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:57,641
today we have massive,
massive access to information 

820
00:33:57,641 --> 00:33:58,940
instantaneously.
But yet you get less of it when it comes

821
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:00,230
to that.
Yeah.

822
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:01,820
And,
and in some ways you get more of it.

823
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:04,220
I mean obviously when there's an 
incident that happens overseas,

824
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:09,250
you can find out about it on twitter as 
fast as you can find out about it 

825
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:09,250
through,
you know,

826
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,760
waiting for a real nice horse to come up
with it.

827
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But you don't get anything that's like 
specifically distributed by the US 

828
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,740
government to let you know the 
consequences of war and say,

829
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:20,090
Hey folks,
we need your support.

830
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:25,090
This is what's really going down.
These are American citizens and this is 

831
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:25,090
what's happening to them over there.
Yeah.

832
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,500
And then the same thing could be said 
for,

833
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,560
hey,
sometimes civilians are going to get 

834
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:32,930
killed and what do we do?
What do we do?

835
00:34:32,931 --> 00:34:37,931
Then do we brush that under the rug and 
we just show the Americans getting 

836
00:34:37,931 --> 00:34:41,501
killed?
Or do you universally show what's 

837
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:41,750
happening?
What war is men wore is jacked up.

838
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,660
I'm here to tell you,
war is not glorious.

839
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,120
It is not fun.
And it is,

840
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,310
it is a horrible,
horrible event.

841
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,790
And so yeah,
I think you should expose it and I think

842
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:57,791
you should expose it at a,
at a high level so that people 

843
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:57,791
understand what we're getting into.
And,

844
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:02,550
and as horrible as war is,
there's many times throughout history 

845
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,760
where war is the absolute in my mind,
in my opinion,

846
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:09,850
the right thing to do and we don't have 
a choice and we need to do something 

847
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:10,460
when,
when horrible things are happening.

848
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:11,690
And,
and you know,

849
00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:12,830
I think that's,
you know,

850
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,470
on my podcast I talk about like the,
like I said,

851
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,100
I talk about war and death and horrible 
genocide and,

852
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:23,190
and that's one of the reasons why I 
think it's gotten a lot of traction is 

853
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,740
because I'm talking about things that 
are otherwise being ignored.

854
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:28,880
And I think people do want to know.
I think people do want to understand war

855
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:33,881
to deeper level,
so that way when they hear a politician 

856
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:33,881
to up there saying,
hey,

857
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,600
we should go to war,
they can at least save themselves.

858
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,740
I know what I know what he's talking 
about.

859
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,540
And he's not just talking about,
hey,

860
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:44,541
we're going to wave the flag.
We're going gonna send some soldiers 

861
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,491
over there and they're kick ass.
They're going to come home and we're 

862
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:46,491
gonna high five.
That's not what war is.

863
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:48,420
And let's not ever forget that.

864
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,420
That's not what war is.
War is a man and another man on a 

865
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,950
battlefield surrounded by people,
civilians,

866
00:35:55,951 --> 00:36:00,951
and they're trying to kill each other 
and it's a blood bath and we shouldn't 

867
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:01,800
forget that.
And is it necessary?

868
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:03,570
Sometimes?
It absolutely is.

869
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,750
It absolutely is necessary sometimes,
but we better way our our minds heavily 

870
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,610
before we make that decision to go and 
execute.

871
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:17,060
Now,
when you think about the evolution of 

872
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,861
human beings,
so you think about how much safer it is 

873
00:36:18,861 --> 00:36:19,080
today versus how it was thousands of 
years ago.

874
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:21,990
Do you ever foresee a time where war 
won't exist?

875
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,710
I don't know.
You know,

876
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,720
people joke with me a lot about the 
robot wars and and robots being able to 

877
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:34,731
accomplish wars.
I actually believed that thing will 

878
00:36:34,731 --> 00:36:37,491
come.
I mean we've got drones right now that 

879
00:36:37,491 --> 00:36:39,780
that are very capable and pretty soon 
we'll have land warfare robots that will

880
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:44,781
be able to go in and clear buildings and
make things happen and then we'll the 

881
00:36:44,781 --> 00:36:48,000
enemy then have robots that will fight 
our robots at some point.

882
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,210
Yeah,
and then at some point will that elevate

883
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,310
to a point where we're not dealing with 
physical robots anymore,

884
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:58,311
but just the software behind the robots 
and now it's just a big sort of cyber 

885
00:36:58,311 --> 00:37:01,680
warfare that is,
that seems conceivable to me now joe,

886
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:08,060
don't mistake me for some kind of like a
Sam Harris intellectual over here or 

887
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,090
that I'm going to sit here and explain 
to you what the future of warfare from a

888
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:14,100
technical perspective,
but from my,

889
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,780
from my rudimentary thought process,
could it not elevate to a point where we

890
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:23,781
have robots fighting robots and then 
that eventually escalates to a point 

891
00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:23,800
where it's some kind of cyber warfare 
with.

892
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:26,520
It's not physical,
but it's just information based and that

893
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:28,170
does make sense to me that that could 
happen.

894
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah,
it makes sense to me too.

895
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:32,340
Especially when you see those Boston 
dynamic robots.

896
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,500
Have you seen those are all things.
You kick them over,

897
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:36,810
they bounced back up.
They run up hills.

898
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:40,380
They can run like 60 miles an hour.
The freaks.

899
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,350
I mean it's really what they're doing 
now is just.

900
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,500
I mean,
who knows where they're going to be 10 

901
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:48,500
years from now,
I mean they're going to be solar powered

902
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,450
the live out there with no food.
Yeah,

903
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,170
it'll be awesome.
And then.

904
00:37:52,171 --> 00:37:54,900
And then then where we go with those 
robots,

905
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:59,930
fight people for awhile.
Probably people that don't know any 

906
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,990
people that don't.
People that don't have good robots yet 

907
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:03,390
and that's not going to be fun for the 
people without robots.

908
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,630
Right.
And we'll see where it goes from there.

909
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,130
I mean,
I think that's just a surrender 

910
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:12,130
scenario,
right?

911
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:12,130
If you got a,
a,

912
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,020
a.
If let's say America has these robots 

913
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,681
that can just come in with ruthless 
precision and take out bad guys and you 

914
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:23,931
know you're going to be at their mercy.
There's a fucking science fiction be 

915
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:28,170
right.
Like China develops robots that take 

916
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:28,170
over New York City.
You look at this guy.

917
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,150
I'm thinking as one of these buses,
robots.

918
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,160
It's just,
it's so weird,

919
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:33,810
man.
To see them moving around.

920
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,220
Yeah,
and what's interesting,

921
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,130
I've seen some other ones

922
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,160
like you don't need them.
They put all this effort into making it 

923
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,650
actually walk instead of have,
you know,

924
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:46,740
wheels or tracks or whatever.
The wheels or tracks with a little pods 

925
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,400
that could get over things would be they
want this to look like for a person.

926
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:53,401
For some reason a human shape is not 
necessarily the most effective structure

927
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,090
for fighting.
It's not even real for us.

928
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,450
Right.
Yeah.

929
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:01,720
Apparently that's one of the reason why 
our backs are so fucked up.

930
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:07,620
You know,
he can't even talk us into standing up 

931
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:07,620
straight,
uh,

932
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:07,620
can pick up 10 pounds.
Okay.

933
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,980
That's a big deal.
I'm better than that.

934
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,960
Yeah.
Fuck this robot someday though.

935
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,080
Well,
it's just,

936
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:17,080
we like things that look like us for,
for whatever reason.

937
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:22,190
You know,
we liked the idea that this thing is 

938
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:22,190
going to look like us,
but yeah,

939
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:22,190
I agree with you.

940
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:22,660
It doesn't need to and it should 
probably not the best.

941
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:27,661
And the real,
the real combat robots probably won't 

942
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:28,210
look like they won't be bipedal.
Yeah.

943
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,910
They won't be bipedal.
They'll probably have a little treads or

944
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:34,020
something and just haul ass at 60 miles 
an hour with the machine guns.

945
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,880
They'll have many legs,
like a.

946
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:40,990
well,
what was that one that was like a 

947
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:40,990
cheetah.
There's some,

948
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,150
some crazy one.
It's like a Cheetah and it runs at some 

949
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,410
fucking ridiculous speed and it's 
terrifying.

950
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,440
They had one that was on a treadmill.
Is this the Cheetah one again?

951
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,810
It's obviously not the best galloping.
It's not the best structure because you 

952
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:59,881
have to make this thing up and run.
Whereas with wheels on it or treads or 

953
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:00,160
something.
Like a tank.

954
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:01,630
A tank.
Yeah.

955
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,110
But I wonder like for getting over logs 
and stuff like that,

956
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:10,111
if there's any sort of benefit,
they also have those ones that leap up 

957
00:40:10,111 --> 00:40:11,050
in the air and they can go over there,
go over the top of walls and shit.

958
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:16,080
Yeah,
that's what you need is some kind of 

959
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,080
legs that can pop out if they need to.
Yeah.

960
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,750
Maybe we should just design this thing 
and take a look.

961
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,240
Here you go.
Here's one of the wheels.

962
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah,
so you guys got get the best of both.

963
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,960
Yeah.
It's fucking terrifying.

964
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,720
That was got front legs and back wheels.
Yeah.

965
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:31,740
They're not fucking playing games and 
didn't google buy them in that Google 

966
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:33,760
skynet?
That's what we should be careful of.

967
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,030
Google is powerful.
God Damn.

968
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,600
Their big announcement they made this 
week about their google io at assistant 

969
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,430
ai stuff is pretty crazy too.
I don't know a bunch of information so I

970
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:50,431
can't tell you.
Just look it up because we're getting 

971
00:40:50,431 --> 00:40:52,711
scared.
This is like the Google theory type 

972
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:52,711
thing.
Yeah,

973
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:52,711
yeah,
yeah,

974
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:52,711
exactly.
This is for the new pixel phone.

975
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:53,230
Yup.
Yup.

976
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:58,500
What does it was launched an extra 
announcements on top of that to what's 

977
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:58,500
supposed to be significant.

978
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:58,930
Whoa.
Do you see that thing?

979
00:40:58,931 --> 00:41:01,330
Jump over a fucking look at this?
Yeah.

980
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:02,230
See,
that's the thing.

981
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:03,880
You Go.
Fuck that thing.

982
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,230
See,
without even knowing it,

983
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,510
I was saying wheels is perfect.
You go back,

984
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,850
rewind that a little bit.
Watch it.

985
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,650
Go over the wall.
He jumps over a wall.

986
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,090
We'll a little bit before that.
Yeah.

987
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:17,700
Watch this.
Watch with this fucking thing.

988
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,630
Can do man.
After it does this,

989
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,240
it goes down these stairs and then it 
gets to.

990
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,360
I mean,
it gets to this wall like a hurdle and 

991
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,720
it fucking bounces over this hurdle.
Like it's nothing.

992
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,340
There's snow,
doesn't matter.

993
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:35,341
Grass doesn't matter.
Doesn't break one of those stupid 

994
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:35,630
wheels.
The problem is,

995
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:37,640
what are those wheels made out?
You shoot one of those wheels,

996
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:38,650
I think fuck,
but look at it.

997
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,060
Bounces right over that.
No problem.

998
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Tucks its legs.
It looks terrifying and they put it 

999
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,300
covered in like some creepy fucking fake
skin.

1000
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,880
Like an alien,
you know?

1001
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,510
Yeah.
And then you'd put sensors on it,

1002
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:56,090
a thermal sensors and night vision 
sensors and you wouldn't be able to get 

1003
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:56,090
away from it.
Yeah.

1004
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:56,930
You know,
what's something you down and kill you.

1005
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,020
I mean just think about that technology 
and then add that tesla technology for 

1006
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,400
self driving cars and knows where all 
the cars are and everything.

1007
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,510
We're just,
we're just a few years away from 

1008
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:10,510
something very,
very bizarre.

1009
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,350
Again,
I kind of look forward to it.

1010
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:18,030
Bring on the robots,
all of the flight or I'll go down to a 

1011
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,520
blaze of glory.
Yeah.

1012
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,820
That's ripping out battery chords and 
trying to take their lives.

1013
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,920
Yeah.
Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator,

1014
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:29,921
it's funny because when the Google 
assistant can see and understand the 

1015
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:29,921
world around you,

1016
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:34,420
they built that like google the Google 
Lens thing that used to be existing and 

1017
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,231
they took it away.
It's kind of just built that thing you 

1018
00:42:38,231 --> 00:42:38,231
tried,
you know,

1019
00:42:38,231 --> 00:42:41,880
you mean Google Glass Lens is that thing
that translates the world,

1020
00:42:41,881 --> 00:42:43,450
that translates languages?
They did.

1021
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,700
They just kind of put all that data into
this and so now it's on that phone and 

1022
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,250
everyone will have it that has the new 
pixel.

1023
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,690
And so what does it do?
It's doing a bunch.

1024
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,920
As far as I know right now it's a bunch 
of ai information.

1025
00:42:54,921 --> 00:42:58,250
So it's looking at barcodes and qr codes
all over the place and it's,

1026
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,970
you don't even have to have a really 
high,

1027
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,870
excuse me,
a good version of it.

1028
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,700
You can do it from far away and they can
read it.

1029
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,120
It can be really low.
A pixilated not saying they're right 

1030
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:10,120
where I'm losing the word.
Um,

1031
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,840
resolution,
low resolution.

1032
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:16,841
You can have a low resolution.
It can pick it up from faraway to off 

1033
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:16,841
the TV.

1034
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:17,900
So that's cool.
This gas was bark.

1035
00:43:17,901 --> 00:43:19,850
Why?
Why do you need to read barcodes?

1036
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,260
Yeah.
Well,

1037
00:43:21,261 --> 00:43:23,420
I know one thing,
it's the new pixel supposed to do,

1038
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:25,600
like say if you have like this Stevia 
and you went,

1039
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,450
oh,
I want to get this,

1040
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:27,440
you know,
it's got a little barcode.

1041
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,680
You put your phone up to it,
show you a link on Amazon and you can 

1042
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:32,680
one click it just like.

1043
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,510
Right.
So that's one good thing that it does 

1044
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:36,510
for the barcodes,
but you know,

1045
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,800
it can compare prices in stores.
It's saying automatically whether it's 

1046
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:40,800
using Amazon and they'll block that

1047
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,610
be.
So basically we're moving into the 

1048
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,470
ultimate age of consumerism.
It's just a step up in instantaneous,

1049
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:52,930
instantaneous purchasing.
But like as far as like reading the 

1050
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:53,030
world around you,
what else is it doing?

1051
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,800
Uh,
I mean,

1052
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,830
I think you'd have to hold it up to see 
it.

1053
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:59,590
So right here it says you can aim it at 
a flower and it will,

1054
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:03,820
and it will identify the species.
You can pull up a band's music or videos

1055
00:44:03,821 --> 00:44:05,620
by pointing the lens at a concert 
poster.

1056
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,200
Whoa.
So like right now there's something that

1057
00:44:08,201 --> 00:44:13,201
popped up Annapolis Fund recently that 
people don't really know because it's 

1058
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:13,201
hard to see.
Like if I type in your name,

1059
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:15,670
joe gets underlined,
if you click that,

1060
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,700
a whole bunch of information pops up and
leads to like all of your things on 

1061
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,580
apple music.
It leads to your webpage.

1062
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,620
It's like a little serious assistant 
thing.

1063
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:28,621
But it's,
it hasn't been advertised and it's not 

1064
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:28,621
really doesn't work for every person 
name.

1065
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:32,660
Like it might not work for Jocko willink
but it will work for Joe Rogan and it 

1066
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,370
might in the future if they update it or
I don't know who needs to update it.

1067
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,560
But that's Kinda cool too.
This is an updated version of that I 

1068
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:39,560
believe,

1069
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:46,300
just to bring this conversation back to 
where we were the further we go in this 

1070
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,570
direction of technology being in every 
part of our lives,

1071
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:54,660
the further away we get from having to 
struggle with things and the bigger hole

1072
00:44:56,351 --> 00:45:00,990
there's going to be in the hole that you
sense and I sense which is if you're not

1073
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
struggling,
if you're not working you for not 

1074
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,531
fighting for something that's just going
to go further and further into the past 

1075
00:45:07,531 --> 00:45:11,911
and further and further down and people 
are going to have that hole to fill up 

1076
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:11,911
somehow.
Yeah.

1077
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:13,750
The physical body needs.
It has requirements.

1078
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:19,020
That is stress requirements and if I 
always did the way I talk about it's 

1079
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:19,020
like a battery

1080
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,490
and like almost like not a conventional 
better the way we think of as,

1081
00:45:21,491 --> 00:45:25,390
but almost like a storage vessel for 
energy and then if you don't do anything

1082
00:45:25,391 --> 00:45:30,391
with that energy,
it's sort of oozes over the side and 

1083
00:45:30,391 --> 00:45:32,971
fucking battery acid crust.
The outside of it like it gets all 

1084
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:35,290
fucked up,
but if you just keep pumping out energy,

1085
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:40,291
you keep doing something.
It maintained some sort of homeostasis 

1086
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:41,030
and maintain some sort of a balance 
point.

1087
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:43,080
It had maintained some sort of a,
um,

1088
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:48,190
a operational happiness like w where the
body's not fighting against itself 

1089
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:53,850
because I think that a lot of people's 
bodies are just fighting against them 

1090
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:54,370
and a lot of like the way that decisions
that are making,

1091
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:57,100
it's a big of a,
a big part of it is it's just not taking

1092
00:45:57,101 --> 00:46:02,101
care of their meat vehicles.
So there's getting all this confusing 

1093
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:02,101
messages from the flesh.

1094
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:07,490
Yeah,
I mean we see that everyday when you 

1095
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:07,710
walk around America and you see people 
that are just,

1096
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,820
you wonder how much longer they're going
to be able to survive.

1097
00:46:11,821 --> 00:46:15,480
And what happens if they,
if there's a fire and they have to run,

1098
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:19,350
they're not going to make it around the 
corner to go to Disneyland.

1099
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,900
Everybody's on a scooter.
It's weird.

1100
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:27,170
It's so weird.
And I have a friend that works at 

1101
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:27,870
Disneyland and he was telling me like,
he started working there 10 years ago.

1102
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:32,650
It was rare to see someone on a scooter 
and now they're all on scooters and then

1103
00:46:32,651 --> 00:46:35,790
not on scooters because they got a 
broken leg or they're old.

1104
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:41,060
They're on scooters because they've 
eaten themselves into this unmanageable 

1105
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,060
shape.
Well,

1106
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,700
again,
even five years ago,

1107
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,040
if you wanted to eat yourself into 
miserable shape,

1108
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:46,680
you had to walk to the grocery store to 
do that,

1109
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:51,390
which was at least some form of movement
and now you just one click on Amazon and

1110
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:56,220
you got the the cheetos in ultra large 
size showing up at your front door.

1111
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,890
Two hours and they're gonna come in at 
drone soon.

1112
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,790
Yeah,
and by the way,

1113
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:02,280
you can just be like cheetos and then 
it'll.

1114
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:07,370
It'll put you up.
The other things that you will probably 

1115
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:07,370
want to.
You want you to what?

1116
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:10,761
You probably want two liters of coke and
you probably want some marshmallows to 

1117
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:10,761
go with that and there you go.
Two hours.

1118
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:11,910
It's there.
You're just killing yourself.

1119
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,210
What the fuck man?
Like when is this gonna end?

1120
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:20,390
I wonder when they're going to be able 
to figure out a way to compensate for 

1121
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,450
all the shit.

1122
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,930
Just some sort of a,
a pill that figures out,

1123
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:28,931
or even crisper I was,
I was listening to this radio lab 

1124
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:30,010
podcast where they're updating crispr.
Where do you know what Crispr

1125
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,310
is?
No,

1126
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:35,740
it's a new tool that they have that 
they're using to modify genes and they,

1127
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:42,620
uh,
they've only figured it out over the 

1128
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,960
last few years and apparently they've 
already started doing work on non-viable

1129
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,750
fetuses in China with this.
That's what they say.

1130
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,000
Who knows whether they want by the time 
they say that,

1131
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:54,210
my thought is the guy telling you is 
probably some fucking fake person by 

1132
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:57,481
then.
By the time it actually gets to the 

1133
00:47:57,481 --> 00:47:59,491
news,
who knows what kind of crazy 

1134
00:47:59,491 --> 00:47:59,491
advancements they're making,
you know,

1135
00:47:59,491 --> 00:48:01,360
behind the Iron Curtain.
Or is there an iron curtain anymore?

1136
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:06,690
Well,
there's China and there's definitely 

1137
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:07,330
some things going on in China for sure 
they're doing some dark shit with people

1138
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:12,331
in this goddamn technology,
but they think that they're not only 

1139
00:48:12,331 --> 00:48:13,840
going to be able to use this gene 
editing tool,

1140
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:19,000
but they're going to be able to implant 
this gene editing tool into our genetics

1141
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:23,110
so that your own genes start doing the 
work of Crispr for you,

1142
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:24,770
so things like they're.

1143
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,310
They think that it's going to take the 
place of antibiotics,

1144
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,580
they think it's going to be able to edit
out things like Alzheimer's,

1145
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:32,320
like whatever the gene is for 
Alzheimer's.

1146
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:35,260
They'll be able to edit that out so 
Alzheimer's will no longer exist.

1147
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:41,050
It's going to be really,
really strange because people are going 

1148
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:41,050
to have to make decisions.
Yeah,

1149
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,940
and I think this stuff is going to come 
quickly once it like.

1150
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,760
Once we turn the corner and it seems 
like it's going to come fast.

1151
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,080
Oh,
it's going to come real fast.

1152
00:48:47,081 --> 00:48:50,170
There's going to be some weird mutations
that happen in there too.

1153
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:55,350
Yeah.
There's going to be people that look 

1154
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,341
like the hulk.
There's going to be going to be people 

1155
00:48:56,341 --> 00:48:58,681
that have won it in two heads and is 
going to be all jacked up and they're 

1156
00:48:58,681 --> 00:48:58,681
going to.
What do we knew?

1157
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:00,580
Those people,
the ones that didn't like you got that.

1158
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,540
It didn't work,
right?

1159
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:06,520
Tiawana crispr job was Chris Hill is.
No,

1160
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,180
it's some sort of a gene editing tool.
I don't know the actual mechanism behind

1161
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,110
it.
I don't understand it.

1162
00:49:11,111 --> 00:49:16,111
I've only listened to people talk about 
it and read things on it and then how 

1163
00:49:16,111 --> 00:49:19,531
far away is immortality from that 
because I want you to eliminate all 

1164
00:49:19,531 --> 00:49:19,660
these different diseases.
Yeah.

1165
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:24,661
I think like 100 years and I always 
thought if you could just clone your 

1166
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,560
body and then you let your body grow to 
be 20 years old,

1167
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:29,440
then you just take your brain out,
put it inside that new body,

1168
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:35,080
then you're good to go because I think 
it's going to be even creepier than 

1169
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,311
that.
I think they're gonna be able to turn 

1170
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:38,710
back the clock because I think that when
you think about like cellular aging,

1171
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,160
like,
well,

1172
00:49:39,161 --> 00:49:44,161
what is it?
Your body's not reproduce every cell in 

1173
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:47,251
your body except for your neurons 
reproduces like somewhere between every 

1174
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:48,250
three to seven years or something like 
that.

1175
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:53,430
Right?
Your neurons are the only things that 

1176
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:53,430
you keep for the,
for the whole life.

1177
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,860
And so what they're thinking is that 
like as time goes on and your,

1178
00:49:56,090 --> 00:50:01,090
you know,
your cells reproduce shittier and 

1179
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:01,090
Shittier,
your telomeres shrink.

1180
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:01,290
It doesn't do what?
Well,

1181
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,350
they'll be able to flip that around so 
that as time goes on,

1182
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:10,351
you'll be like Benjamin buttons.
You'll start getting younger and 

1183
00:50:10,351 --> 00:50:12,841
younger,
which will be really weird if they fuck 

1184
00:50:12,841 --> 00:50:12,841
it up and you start turning into a baby,
you know,

1185
00:50:12,841 --> 00:50:14,560
you're like some 50 year old.
Then all of a sudden you're like,

1186
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:15,640
dude,
I'm 12 again.

1187
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,310
Like this is not good.
Next year I'm going to be 11.

1188
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:23,500
You know,
like if it goes backwards and that 

1189
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:23,500
direction,
if they can literally halt it,

1190
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:28,200
like if they can take you.
And then like say if you're a 40 year 

1191
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:28,200
woman and

1192
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,110
they put you on a 20 year program and 
they're like,

1193
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:35,111
well in 20 years instead of being 60,
you're going to be 20 and this is how 

1194
00:50:35,111 --> 00:50:36,560
it's going to work.
Next year you're going to be 39 next.

1195
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,150
That's totally conceivable.
That's totally conceivable.

1196
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,850
Totally 100 percent conceivable 
possible.

1197
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:46,300
And likely,
yeah.

1198
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:49,160
Then then that a mortality thing isn't 
that far away.

1199
00:50:49,161 --> 00:50:54,161
Then the only thing that's gonna fuck 
you up as accidents and murder and shit 

1200
00:50:54,161 --> 00:50:57,941
like that.
And Mr Rhodes is life become more 

1201
00:50:57,941 --> 00:50:57,941
precious than.
Because now you're thinking,

1202
00:50:57,941 --> 00:51:01,900
Hey,
I don't want to go skydiving because I 

1203
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:01,900
could actually live for thousands of 
years if I don't screw this up.

1204
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:07,150
I think more likely you're going to see 
a lot more par corp and those assholes 

1205
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,150
that are doing back flips off the Grand 
Canyon.

1206
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,150
Like that kind of shit.
You're going to see more,

1207
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:16,210
more,
more people that are wanting to feel 

1208
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:16,700
alive by taking crazy risks.

1209
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,700
Those Russian dudes though.
Well,

1210
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:23,330
I had James Kingston on the podcast.
He's that crazy asshole from England.

1211
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,130
Great Kid.
But he's.

1212
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,610
He's does back flips on the top of 
fucking buildings and Dubai and shit.

1213
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,170
Like,
what are you doing,

1214
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:30,790
man?
Yeah.

1215
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,320
You posted one of those the other day.
He said something like,

1216
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,760
you know,
I don't know how you wrote it,

1217
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:39,761
but you said something like my 
sentiments exactly that is jacked up.

1218
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,060
It was one just a couple of days ago.
These guys released it.

1219
00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:46,340
They were on the Golden Gate Bridge.
I didn't even watch it.

1220
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,590
Do you see Jamie?
I wouldn't even watch it though,

1221
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:50,600
like daredevils were on the Golden Gate 
Bridge,

1222
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:54,830
but you see them on the very top of the 
golden gate bridge doing some silly shit

1223
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:59,831
hanging off the edge.
Like I did some dumb stuff when I was 

1224
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:02,120
younger.
I did some rock climbing without ropes.

1225
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:07,121
Not not any Alex honnold stuff,
but you know where I would definitely 

1226
00:52:07,121 --> 00:52:07,121
get injured if I fell.

1227
00:52:07,121 --> 00:52:09,560
That was just being young and stupid.
I remember one time we were.

1228
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:13,070
I was on a ship out in the middle of the
navy ship out in the middle of the ocean

1229
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:16,610
somewhere.
I was in a seal platoon somewhere and me

1230
00:52:16,611 --> 00:52:21,611
and one of my buddies,
we were doing pull ups off the side of 

1231
00:52:21,611 --> 00:52:22,140
the ship at night on a little cable.
Oh Jesus.

1232
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:24,620
That cable breaks or if we slip off and 
fall,

1233
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:29,680
you're 100 percent going to die.
But we were doing it anyways because we 

1234
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:29,680
were just young and stupid.
Wow.

1235
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:33,170
Want to feel that juice?
The juice prewar you know,

1236
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:38,171
there's no war going on.
How do we prove to our buddies that we 

1237
00:52:38,171 --> 00:52:40,940
are brave and bad ass or you do stupid 
stuff,

1238
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,500
dumb stuff hanging off the side of a 
ship on a cable.

1239
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,570
What does that rush like?
It's got to be a crazy rush.

1240
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:52,160
Right?
And knowing that you can't let go.

1241
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:57,110
It's just dumb.
But what do you do when your whatever 23

1242
00:52:57,111 --> 00:52:59,900
years old,
there's something that like particularly

1243
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,960
in the human brain,
there's something that resonates about 

1244
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,420
hanging from something by your hands.
Like that's one of the scariest ones.

1245
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:12,170
Like Kingston is on this gigantic crane 
and he's hanging onto the crane with his

1246
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:17,171
hands and then he does it with one hand.
He's hanging in there and he's fucking 

1247
00:53:17,171 --> 00:53:18,210
hundreds of feet up and if he falls,
he's just.

1248
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,720
He just a water balloon.
Oh,

1249
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,830
but there's something about,
for some reason like balancing scary,

1250
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,350
but hanging is really scary.
I'm the opposite.

1251
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,410
Really?
Balances Scarier than hanging.

1252
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:32,880
I'd rather hang.
I feel pretty,

1253
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,990
pretty good hanging.
We don't do a lot of chips.

1254
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,620
I don't feel good about the balancing 
because I think I could trip and fall.

1255
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:43,290
That's it.
What's the life expectancy of Kingston?

1256
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:44,790
Not so good.
I mean,

1257
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:45,720
he knows that,
right?

1258
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:47,130
Yeah.
He's got to know that.

1259
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,720
He's a smart guy too,
which is really weird and really calm.

1260
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,640
Look at these fucking assholes.
Oh Jesus.

1261
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:57,420
Oh my God.
This guy.

1262
00:53:57,421 --> 00:53:58,400
Folks,
if you listening,

1263
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:03,420
this guy has a skateboard and he is on a
couple thousand feet in the fucking air.

1264
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,070
Shit.
It's terrifying.

1265
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,920
I mean,
how many of these guys die?

1266
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,200
It's not that many.
That's what's weird about it.

1267
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,910
I saw it.
I saw a video.

1268
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,520
One guy for Happenin.
Oh really?

1269
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,910
It didn't make it.
Where was it?

1270
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,590
I Dunno.
Something somewhere in Russia.

1271
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,870
Of course.
What was he doing?

1272
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,670
He doing this walking around up on some 
high.

1273
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:24,660
Yeah.

1274
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:32,270
This kid is getting.
They get right to the edge with 

1275
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,520
skateboards barefoot.
What the fuck dude?

1276
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:41,050
What is that word?
Did you talk to him about how he,

1277
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:45,490
how he built into this?
Did he start at 20 feet and then he went

1278
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,350
to 30 feet and then he got more 
confident?

1279
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,430
No,
I don't think gene.

1280
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:51,520
Well,
he's got the.

1281
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,180
He's a smart guy.
He's a weird guy because you meet them.

1282
00:54:55,181 --> 00:55:00,181
You're expecting like I'm gonna talk to 
this meth doubt psychopath who just 

1283
00:55:00,181 --> 00:55:02,590
wants to just get a juice rush all day 
long.

1284
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:05,920
Now he's super calm and relaxed and 
normal.

1285
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,140
It's weird.
Doesn't make any sense.

1286
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:10,270
But where did it start for him?
I don't know.

1287
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,610
I don't know.
He's got a normal family.

1288
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,080
Seems healthy.
Yeah,

1289
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:15,600
he just likes it.
He pulled out a weird,

1290
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:19,460
weird Alex Hall.
You had alex honnold.

1291
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,380
Yeah.
And you know,

1292
00:55:20,381 --> 00:55:21,590
we,
my family,

1293
00:55:21,591 --> 00:55:24,160
we go up to Yosemite and stuff,
so we are familiar,

1294
00:55:24,161 --> 00:55:26,230
but you can see how he kind of edged 
into it.

1295
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:27,820
Right?
And you start climbing and you got ropes

1296
00:55:27,821 --> 00:55:29,200
and then you get really good at it and 
then you're like,

1297
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:34,201
you know what,
I can probably make it to there without 

1298
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:35,641
a rope.
And then next thing you know you're 

1299
00:55:35,641 --> 00:55:36,781
probably make it there too.
And then the next thing you know you're 

1300
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:37,690
climbing El Capitan with no rope or 
halftone with no rope,

1301
00:55:37,691 --> 00:55:39,360
which is completely,
you know somebody.

1302
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:44,580
Yeah,
completely insane to even think about 

1303
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,011
that though.
He does some insane stuff where you're 

1304
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:47,090
going backwards,
like you're at a reverse degrees,

1305
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:52,630
15 degrees the wrong way,
like any climbs up at to go above it and

1306
00:55:52,631 --> 00:55:55,370
he's got no ropes and he's just hang on 
with hands.

1307
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,220
It was like,
what the fuck dude?

1308
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:00,250
He was telling us a story about one time
where he's halfway up the mountain.

1309
00:56:00,251 --> 00:56:05,251
He realized he forgot his powder.
So he ran into some other people that 

1310
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:05,560
were up there that were on ropes.
He said,

1311
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:06,630
Hey,
can I borrow your powder?

1312
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,000
Like a,
you know what I mean?

1313
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:09,550
Like,
yeah bro,

1314
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,560
pack powder bag at the top of the 
mountain.

1315
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:15,280
Like yeah,
I heard him talking about it,

1316
00:56:15,281 --> 00:56:20,281
that he,
for him it's not a big deal because he 

1317
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:24,341
knows how strong he is and he knows what
his limitations are so it doesn't for 

1318
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:24,341
it,

1319
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:27,250
it's like he's comfortable with it.
Right.

1320
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:32,340
He's comfortable.
It's like someone walking on a balance 

1321
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,381
beam that does it all the time.
They're going to be comfortable with it 

1322
00:56:34,381 --> 00:56:34,381
and he's climbing stuff all the time.
So He's more company.

1323
00:56:34,381 --> 00:56:36,280
It's still hard to get a grip on though.
It's hard to get a grip.

1324
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,750
You know,
when I was hosting fear factor,

1325
00:56:37,751 --> 00:56:42,751
we had this one thing that we did where 
we had people hanging from a pole that 

1326
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:48,541
was suspended over this water and it was
shocking how slow like the least,

1327
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,760
the little amount of time,
the small amount of time that men in 

1328
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,741
particular could hang from a pole.
Like they were like a minute and these 

1329
00:56:58,741 --> 00:57:00,160
guys were dropping into the water and I 
was like,

1330
00:57:00,161 --> 00:57:02,500
what the fuck?
Like women want it regular.

1331
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:07,501
Yeah.
Women want it because they have have 

1332
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:09,990
lighter bodies.
So even though their hands might be 

1333
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:09,990
weaker,
like,

1334
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:14,080
and one guy was fucking Jack,
there's like this football player 

1335
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:14,080
looking dude,
and he didn't make it man.

1336
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,000
He was like a minute and 15 in,
plop it into the water.

1337
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:17,350
I was like,
this is crazy.

1338
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:22,590
I had,
I had a guy in my field training class 

1339
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,580
that was a big giant monster guy and he 
couldn't complete the obstacle course.

1340
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:25,340
No,
you know,

1341
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,640
too many of clients.
Strength is too much,

1342
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:32,670
too much mass behind you that you're 
asking small limbs or small digits to 

1343
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:35,710
control.
And then also too much of your heart has

1344
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,930
to pump too much blood through that 
tissue.

1345
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:41,470
There's like a point of diminishing 
returns when it comes to size,

1346
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,760
you know?
That's one of the things that you saw 

1347
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,871
when you see Cain Velasquez fight guys.
Cain Valasquez has always been in that 

1348
00:57:48,871 --> 00:57:50,890
sweet spot of about 2:40
2:40

1349
00:57:50,891 --> 00:57:54,670
to me is about as big as you want to get
because the guys over to 40 men,

1350
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,620
they might fuck you up in the first few 
minutes,

1351
00:57:56,621 --> 00:58:01,621
but he take them into that fourth and 
fifth minute of the first round and 

1352
00:58:01,621 --> 00:58:02,650
they're huffing and puffing and then the
second round they're getting their asses

1353
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:07,651
kicked and the Cain Velasquez storm was 
the one of the more fascinating things 

1354
00:58:07,841 --> 00:58:12,841
to watch in all my years of the UFC 
because he was a heavyweight that had 

1355
00:58:12,841 --> 00:58:14,920
the cardio of a lightweight,
but he was again,

1356
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,240
240 pounds.

1357
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:19,420
Oh well,
well marbled 240 pounds.

1358
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,150
He's not like he was a lean.
No,

1359
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,110
he had some.
He always looks a little bit.

1360
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,120
He had a lot of Mexican food.
Some rice and beans eaten.

1361
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:32,220
Lunch would be like for real,
like you like one of the elite 

1362
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,861
heavyweights ever and he's sitting there
with fucking 10 tacos and shit and you 

1363
00:58:34,861 --> 00:58:39,061
know that's a talent to the.
Having that kind of sustained energy is 

1364
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:43,040
a talent.
Just like some guys are super flexible 

1365
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,900
and some guys are super strong and 
explosive and some guys just have that 

1366
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,110
they can to have that range and what is 
it?

1367
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:48,340
Medium twitch muscles,
right?

1368
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,780
It's medium twitch,
slow twitch.

1369
00:58:49,781 --> 00:58:53,740
You will know that twitch,
which is I'm a marathoner,

1370
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:58,790
right?
And then there's fast twitch which is 

1371
00:58:58,790 --> 00:58:58,870
almond Olympic weightlifter,
but in recent years they've said there's

1372
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:03,871
actually something in the middle twitch 
which is I'm strong but I can go for a 

1373
00:59:03,871 --> 00:59:03,871
long time.

1374
00:59:03,871 --> 00:59:08,010
That's interesting.
I didn't know about that but it makes 

1375
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:08,110
sense and that's what I got like Kainos 
because cane like you said,

1376
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:11,080
I mean for him to be able to get in 
there and go five rounds pushing away,

1377
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,480
pushing around another guy that weighs 
260 pounds.

1378
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:15,200
Yeah,
that's beast mode right there.

1379
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:20,230
There's a lot going on with Kane.
I think one thing is going on his 

1380
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:20,710
genetics,
he has incredible genetics and they,

1381
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,170
they like Bob Cook would tell me that 
cain would be out for months,

1382
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:29,350
like get an injury and come back and 
it's outwork everybody like it just 

1383
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:32,530
insane cardio.
So maybe it's also that his base was so 

1384
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:35,660
rock solid that his attache for three 
months is everybody else's,

1385
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,720
you know,
peak condition and what's one of the 

1386
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:40,720
reasons why he was able to overwhelm so 
many people,

1387
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,890
but also like when you see cain execute 
things,

1388
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:45,440
he's never straining like Cain.

1389
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,730
Everything is perfect technique.
There's no like there's no like grunting

1390
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:54,731
and forcing anything.
There's no like crazy look on his face 

1391
00:59:54,731 --> 00:59:58,781
and like the windmill punches,
everything is clean and crisp and it's 

1392
00:59:58,781 --> 01:00:03,311
all like very efficient.
Vishal movies and machine and obviously 

1393
01:00:03,311 --> 01:00:05,600
that comes from training the heart.
And is that training hard to hard?

1394
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,560
Has he been trying to or is that why 
he's all dinged up then?

1395
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:08,900
Yes.
Some flights because of injuries.

1396
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:13,930
Well there's also the mind like his mind
is so strong that he's able to overcome 

1397
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:16,970
the feeling of pain.
But sometimes like elite athletes,

1398
01:00:16,971 --> 01:00:21,971
especially fighters,
they can't distinguish between what is 

1399
01:00:21,971 --> 01:00:21,971
just like dings,
like everybody gets dinged up,

1400
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,640
but something that's a significant 
injury like,

1401
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:30,670
hey,
you've got to compromise in the 

1402
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:30,670
structure of your body.
If you keep pushing it,

1403
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:31,910
you're going to blow this knee out,
you're going to fuck this disk up,

1404
01:00:31,911 --> 01:00:36,911
you're going to need surgery,
and the caines had a gang of surgeries 

1405
01:00:36,911 --> 01:00:38,930
now shoulder,
knees back and now you know,

1406
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:43,931
he's been out for quite a while with 
this most recent back issues and it 

1407
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:47,000
sucks because in my opinion it's like 
him and Fader,

1408
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:52,120
you know,
those are the two greatest heavyweights 

1409
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:52,120
of all time.

1410
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:52,250
Interestingly,
same similar body style.

1411
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,080
Yeah.
Thirty to 40.

1412
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,640
Well marbled.
Yeah.

1413
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,520
Yeah.
Feta,

1414
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,600
feta or at its peak had like the 
ultimate dad bod.

1415
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,420
He had like a dad that used to play 
rugby,

1416
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:04,910
you know,
fuck guys up.

1417
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,340
They'd post those videos though of him 
training in Russia,

1418
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,060
running with his buddies and swinging 
kettlebells and yeah,

1419
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,870
this guy works hard.
Oh yeah,

1420
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,360
no doubt.
He just probably ate shitty food.

1421
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:16,400
You had just tons of it,
you know.

1422
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:19,190
But it's also like their methodology is 
just different.

1423
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,580
I mean he was very,
very old school with his methods,

1424
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:27,581
like he was doing kettle bells but way 
before crossfit or came to America.

1425
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:29,650
I mean,
there was a,

1426
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:34,720
there's an old school pictures,
see if he could find a jamie back when 

1427
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,451
he was jacked,
like he got smaller as his career went 

1428
01:01:37,451 --> 01:01:41,381
on because he stopped doing strength and
conditioning as his body got older and 

1429
01:01:41,381 --> 01:01:42,890
for focused more on skill work.

1430
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:45,290
But there's this ancient picture,
not ancient,

1431
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:50,291
but this is a picture of him standing 
there shirtless around a bunch of 

1432
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:53,930
Kettlebell Kettlebell lecture,
2001 or something like that,

1433
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:58,931
you know,
and the thing that I think that he 

1434
01:01:58,931 --> 01:01:58,931
really had,
which he had a good,

1435
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:01,460
his skill in my mind was that he was 
really good.

1436
01:02:01,461 --> 01:02:02,990
Grapplers a really good striker,
but he,

1437
01:02:02,991 --> 01:02:06,890
the way he mixed them together,
you would see him just like hit somebody

1438
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:08,990
in the face and then judo,
throw them into an arm,

1439
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:12,230
lock them or choke them.
It was all just so smooth.

1440
01:02:12,231 --> 01:02:17,231
I don't think anyone knew what to defend
because if they defended one thing they 

1441
01:02:17,231 --> 01:02:17,231
getting,
if they defended it,

1442
01:02:17,231 --> 01:02:17,390
uh,
uh,

1443
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,020
uh,
grappling,

1444
01:02:18,021 --> 01:02:23,021
move,
they're getting punched in the face if 

1445
01:02:23,021 --> 01:02:23,021
they do

1446
01:02:23,021 --> 01:02:23,021
defendant upon.
They were getting taken down.

1447
01:02:23,021 --> 01:02:23,430
Yeah,
he was something special man.

1448
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,520
And you know,
he was something special for quite a 

1449
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:28,520
long time to.
I don't,

1450
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,030
I don't think anybody can keep going 
longer than like,

1451
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,240
just like a time that you can compete at
the highest level.

1452
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,490
Some folks think it's about eight,
nine years.

1453
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:37,110
They're like an ad after eight,
nine years.

1454
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:39,210
The highest level.
Like nobody's body holds up,

1455
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,040
it just all falls apart.
And you know,

1456
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:44,220
as much as I'm talking good about fate 
or in his style and everything,

1457
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,570
let's face it.
What was the best about Fei door was his

1458
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,860
attitude when he would just come in 
there with no emotions raised his hand,

1459
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:54,060
dead face,
you know,

1460
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:56,310
they'd introduce him,
he just raised his hand and he'd destroy

1461
01:02:56,311 --> 01:02:59,220
someone and he would have the same space
like before he fought,

1462
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:02,400
just had total absence of emotion.

1463
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:05,040
That was to me,
that's what I always thought.

1464
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:10,100
Yes,
that's right up there at the top of my 

1465
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:10,100
list.
So there's the picture.

1466
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:15,350
Exactly.
Just jacked standing around a bunch of 

1467
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:16,260
fucking iron cannonballs with handles on
them.

1468
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,270
And those aren't some little kittle 
bills either.

1469
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:23,300
Yeah,
I bet that picture alone must've sold 

1470
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,091
millions of dollars with kettlebells.
People saw that picture and they're 

1471
01:03:26,091 --> 01:03:26,790
like,
I gotta get some at.

1472
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:28,870
But he also was very smart.
It,

1473
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,880
that's his brother actually.
He was very smart with his training 

1474
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:33,880
where,
you know,

1475
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,120
he spent some time in Holland for him 
and his brother,

1476
01:03:36,121 --> 01:03:38,220
like way back in the day,
the picture of his brother now and get a

1477
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:40,190
picture of Alexander and he just got out
of jail.

1478
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,570
I don't know,
I wonder if he's gonna fight again.

1479
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:45,210
His brother was a bad motherfucker.
He was,

1480
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,720
he's an animal.
He's got the uh,

1481
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,650
there's something about Russians,
man.

1482
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:54,680
For sure.
There are different kinds of white 

1483
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:54,680
people.
They totally different.

1484
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,190
They just did so much different.
Well,

1485
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:57,630
it's the hard upbringing.
Yo.

1486
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,350
Yeah,
man.

1487
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:01,410
Diamonds,
diamonds made out of pressure.

1488
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:06,990
And the other guy that comes to mind 
when we're thinking about old school 

1489
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:08,280
fighters that really,
it wasn't just his skill set,

1490
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:13,281
which was unbelievable.
Sakharova [inaudible] the way soccer 

1491
01:04:13,281 --> 01:04:13,281
Robert.
His craziness.

1492
01:04:13,281 --> 01:04:17,640
Oh yeah.
And just to go in there and just have 

1493
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,520
that incredibly playful attitude.
Also chain smoked and drank through this

1494
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:23,010
entire camp chain.
Smoked and drank.

1495
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,860
I went out with him in Japan after one 
of his fights one time.

1496
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,540
What did he do?
He was just getting after it.

1497
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,200
But that attitude of not giving a fuck 
is like,

1498
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:36,630
that's what worked so well for them 
inside the.

1499
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:37,740
Inside the ring.
Yeah.

1500
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:39,450
Well I know we see this all the time 
with fighters.

1501
01:04:39,451 --> 01:04:42,000
We with anybody that is going to live 
out on the fringe like that,

1502
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:44,520
they're going to have some sort of 
offset.

1503
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:45,690
There's,
there's another,

1504
01:04:45,691 --> 01:04:47,910
there's for every action there's an 
equal and opposite reaction.

1505
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:52,911
Right?
So you get a guy that's living that far 

1506
01:04:52,911 --> 01:04:52,911
on the edge like soccer.
Robert was that,

1507
01:04:52,911 --> 01:04:54,410
that edge just doesn't stop when he gets
out of the kids.

1508
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:56,430
Right.
Just going and going to get after it.

1509
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,430
He had some horrible losses though.
He got,

1510
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,500
he got,
you know,

1511
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:08,460
used in an exploited worse than anyone 
else.

1512
01:05:08,461 --> 01:05:09,060
Right.
I mean,

1513
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:14,070
worse than any other fighter,
no one has been exploited and put into 

1514
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:16,110
those horrible flights where he just 
wasn't out.

1515
01:05:16,111 --> 01:05:17,210
I mean,
he was just outmatched.

1516
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,130
He was old,

1517
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,160
he wasn't trained right.
And they would just put them in there 

1518
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:23,160
and just let them get destroyed.
Well,

1519
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,130
his knees were mad so he would wrap his 
knees up like a mummy.

1520
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,870
Yeah,
they were horrible.

1521
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:30,760
And you knew that that was a real 
injury.

1522
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:31,410
Like he,
uh,

1523
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:34,540
like he couldn't move so good.
His knees were all wrapped up and fucked

1524
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:37,990
up and then they put them in there with 
vandelay and vandelay knocked him out.

1525
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:38,920
What,
three times?

1526
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:40,660
Brutal.
Brutal chaos,

1527
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,240
I think at least twice.
I'm trying to think of it's two or three

1528
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:44,770
times.
But um,

1529
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,220
and then Melvin manhoef who,
whether it was soccer,

1530
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:50,830
kicking them because you get soccer kick
and pride and stomp.

1531
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,370
Yeah.
He had some really tough fights.

1532
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,830
He's apparently doing a grappling super 
fight now.

1533
01:05:56,831 --> 01:05:59,170
I think he's grappling.
He grappled Benzo.

1534
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,000
Yeah,
that's right.

1535
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:06,030
That's right.
I was thinking of what I was actually 

1536
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:06,760
thinking of Shinya Aoki is going to 
grapple with Gary Tonin.

1537
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:07,400
Oh,
that'll be.

1538
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:08,050
Yeah,
yeah.

1539
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:09,730
They're going to have a straight up 
grappling.

1540
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:11,290
Yeah.
Garrett can fuck them up.

1541
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:13,450
Most likely,
but I okies good man.

1542
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:18,451
Especially now.
But it's a big difference between guys 

1543
01:06:18,451 --> 01:06:21,320
who are good in mma and guys who are 
good at like straight up grandpa and the

1544
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:24,880
training vids of Gary,
just like he's just trained all the,

1545
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:25,540
all,
all he does.

1546
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:27,370
He's completely obsessed with Jujitsu.
I love it.

1547
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:32,460
Yeah.
And he's doing rope climbs and he's 

1548
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:32,460
just,
that's all he does.

1549
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:35,890
So he's also being coached by John 
Donner and he's a part of that Henzel 

1550
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:37,570
Gracie crew in New York City.
And that Donna,

1551
01:06:37,571 --> 01:06:39,420
her death squad man,
you want to talk about a,

1552
01:06:39,421 --> 01:06:42,700
uh,
a real like wizard of Jujitsu.

1553
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:46,780
Donna her understand his instagram posts
or some of the very best instagram posts

1554
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,430
on the Internet.
I haven't.

1555
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,420
I got to follow him then.

1556
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:50,410
Oh,
you got it man.

1557
01:06:50,411 --> 01:06:53,590
His breakdowns of certain techniques and
matches and what went well,

1558
01:06:53,591 --> 01:06:55,930
what went wrong and what's required of 
athletes and,

1559
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:01,290
and how to excel and the difference 
between an athlete and competition 

1560
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:04,831
versus a difference in training.
This one was the most recent things 

1561
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:07,710
about putting yourself in bad positions 
and working on your weaknesses as 

1562
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:09,580
opposed to just continuing to push your 
strengths.

1563
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:11,020
Well,
that's a big one though.

1564
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:16,370
The fighters that are good in training,
but they're not good at in their cage 

1565
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:17,620
and there's other fighters that are kind
of get beat up and training,

1566
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:18,730
but then when they get in the cage,
they.

1567
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:23,850
They rise to the occasion.
I got to see that a bunch with a bunch 

1568
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:23,890
of different fighters over the years 
that I trained with and you'd say,

1569
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:26,090
this guy is going to do okay,
but then they'd get in,

1570
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,840
they'd get in the cage and boom,
they would just turn it on.

1571
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:33,840
They elevate themselves and then some 
guys that are crushing everyone during 

1572
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:33,840
training,
they get in the cage,

1573
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,830
you know,
UFC fight night or whatever,

1574
01:07:35,831 --> 01:07:37,210
and they just,
they just can't.

1575
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:42,540
They can't get it done that night.
Even though they're crushing people in 

1576
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:42,540
the draining.
Yeah.

1577
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:42,540
There's so many factors.
Right.

1578
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:47,491
And I think some of them are also the 
ability to overcome adversity and with 

1579
01:07:47,491 --> 01:07:49,510
really talented guys,
they didn't really have to overcome that

1580
01:07:49,511 --> 01:07:52,150
much adversity because they were good 
really quickly.

1581
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,760
Like guys who had massive physical 
advantages.

1582
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:56,800
And then for some reason,
you know,

1583
01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:01,910
once they faced other people that also 
have physical advantages but were 

1584
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,910
tougher,
they would just go.

1585
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,850
It just fall apart.
Just wilt.

1586
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,890
Yeah.
It's so common.

1587
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:08,110
Yeah.
You got to get that in.

1588
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:13,580
And we got some guys that,
this guy at the gym right now who's 

1589
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:13,580
just,
he's just a,

1590
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:15,220
he's a mutant.
He's a mutant.

1591
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,340
Like he's so

1592
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:17,780
strong.
He,

1593
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:22,930
I hose it,
he shot on me the other day I sprawled 

1594
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:24,200
on him.
And so he's on all fours and he's,

1595
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:28,490
he fights at one 85.
I'm on all fours and he picks me up with

1596
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:32,170
one hand with one hand,
picks me up and slams me and gets across

1597
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,220
side.
And I said,

1598
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:35,540
Bro,
did you just like shot,

1599
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:38,690
put me right there.
And 180,

1600
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:40,880
he people walk around.
He walks around the 200,

1601
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:41,450
two.
Oh five.

1602
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:43,000
You know,
typical picture on the one hand,

1603
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,870
one hand,
but not with his back,

1604
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:47,720
but like with his arm,
you're going to see him,

1605
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:49,010
Taylor Johnson,
watch out for him.

1606
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:51,140
What is this background?
He wrestled,

1607
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,020
he wrestled,
he it.

1608
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:53,160
But this is the thing.
We know,

1609
01:08:53,161 --> 01:08:58,161
we know this right?
There's wrestlers that are great 

1610
01:08:58,161 --> 01:09:00,401
wrestlers and they're.
And they're okay at Jujitsu but they 

1611
01:09:00,401 --> 01:09:01,160
can't quite make that transition and 
they're strikings okay.

1612
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,100
But they can't quite make that 
transition for whatever reason,

1613
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:09,130
whatever gift he's got.
He saw the other day we were training 

1614
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:11,240
and he's been training.
This was a few months ago.

1615
01:09:11,241 --> 01:09:12,950
He's been training for like six months,
right.

1616
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,820
And he dives for a commuter on me and I,
you know,

1617
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:20,270
I move and get out and you know,
we keep training,

1618
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,320
whatever,
and we get done.

1619
01:09:21,321 --> 01:09:21,860
He goes,
man,

1620
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:22,550
you know,
I just,

1621
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:25,090
I can't lock anything up on your,
you can't like I can't,

1622
01:09:25,091 --> 01:09:27,380
I can't get any finishes on you.
And I was like,

1623
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:31,640
Bro,
you've been training for six months.

1624
01:09:31,641 --> 01:09:36,641
There's guys who have been training here
for 10 years that have never even 

1625
01:09:36,641 --> 01:09:37,850
attempted a submission on me and you're 
trying to submit me with mile,

1626
01:09:37,851 --> 01:09:39,590
move the camera.
I'm like,

1627
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,390
Bro,
don't worry about it.

1628
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:42,950
It's going to come.
So yeah,

1629
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:47,980
it's it.
But my point is with him is he's an 

1630
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,070
incredible athlete and he's got that 
work ethic too,

1631
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:54,190
and so,
and he's competed at a high level and 

1632
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:54,190
wrestling,
you know,

1633
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:54,190
he's an all American wrestler.

1634
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:54,320
I think d two though,
but you know,

1635
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,620
nonetheless he savage.
Yeah.

1636
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,580
Pe,
there's the ability to compete.

1637
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,260
It's a,
it's an interesting ability.

1638
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:02,870
Like some people just don't have it or 
they wore the.

1639
01:10:02,871 --> 01:10:07,871
It's not even that they don't have it.
They lack the mental skills to overcome 

1640
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,570
pressure filled obstacles.
Yeah.

1641
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:14,770
And you're right.
And there's some people that step up 

1642
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:15,080
when that happens.
And can you train to do that?

1643
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:17,360
I think you can think you can.
I think you can.

1644
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:20,780
Do you inoculate yourself to the stress.
It's just the mind.

1645
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:26,020
So like you like the idea that these 
pitfalls and the mind are 

1646
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:26,120
insurmountable.
I think that's ridiculous.

1647
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:28,340
That seems to be more surmountable or 
more,

1648
01:10:28,341 --> 01:10:29,690
um,
more,

1649
01:10:29,691 --> 01:10:34,691
uh,
more passable than physical problems 

1650
01:10:34,691 --> 01:10:38,621
because like physical problems,
like if you're 140 pounds and the guys 

1651
01:10:38,621 --> 01:10:41,651
240 pounds,
you're both equally talented and both 

1652
01:10:41,651 --> 01:10:41,870
equally driven.

1653
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:42,680
Boy,
you're fucked.

1654
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:43,720
You're fucked.
Yeah.

1655
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,590
Well,
that being said,

1656
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:48,170
it is similar to what we talked about 
earlier,

1657
01:10:48,171 --> 01:10:50,180
which is when you have somebody that's 
caught in their own mind,

1658
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,100
they can't get the perspective to step 
out.

1659
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,090
You're like,
dude,

1660
01:10:53,091 --> 01:10:55,730
just calm down.
Just kind of freak out about.

1661
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,260
You're going to go in there.
What if I lose it?

1662
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:59,660
She loses no big deal.
We'll get around.

1663
01:10:59,661 --> 01:11:00,650
It will train more.
It's no big deal.

1664
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,960
They can't get over that.
And so you do get people that get 

1665
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:06,050
trapped in their minds.
And I mean there's all kinds of fighters

1666
01:11:06,051 --> 01:11:07,790
that have gone through that never came 
out of it.

1667
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,500
Well,
there's a really important quote.

1668
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:10,580
If you win,
you win.

1669
01:11:10,581 --> 01:11:11,810
If you lose,
you learn.

1670
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,970
And so you always win.
And if you really

1671
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,980
can think about it that way,
every time I remember pretty much every 

1672
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:21,240
time I've ever been humiliated on the 
Mat,

1673
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,090
every time I've ever been,
like really manhandled and tapped,

1674
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:29,120
I remember them very well.
And I also remember like every time I 

1675
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,660
rolled with like a real high level 
Blackville and got my ass handed to me,

1676
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:33,570
my training jumped up a notch because 
like,

1677
01:11:33,571 --> 01:11:34,310
uh,
you know,

1678
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,610
that expression,
the rub,

1679
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,590
like you train with someone who's way 
better and you know,

1680
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:38,790
you realize like,
oh,

1681
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:41,940
there's a whatever I thought was like a 
high frequency.

1682
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:45,870
There's people that are operating like 
several hundred rpms faster than that.

1683
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,170
And I just hadn't encountered them,
you know.

1684
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:51,480
And I think that to be around that is so
important.

1685
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:55,160
If you ever trained with a guy that like
trains in a small town and uh,

1686
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:58,800
all the people in the town is like maybe
like a purple belt coaches and they,

1687
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:03,910
they have like a,
there's a certain rpm that they all 

1688
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:03,910
operate in.

1689
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:06,900
And if you come in and you're used to 
that fucking San Diego assassin,

1690
01:12:06,901 --> 01:12:08,460
rpm.
And they like,

1691
01:12:08,461 --> 01:12:11,250
what the fuck is this guy doing?
Like they're just not used to it.

1692
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:16,280
They have or.
But if you come from a place like that 

1693
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:16,590
and you try to train it,
hence or something like that,

1694
01:12:16,591 --> 01:12:20,210
like you're dealing with you jumping 
into a fucking pit of killers like,

1695
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,450
and that's,
you know,

1696
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:23,580
that old expression,
iron sharpens iron.

1697
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,040
Who could not be more true when it comes
to Jujitsu.

1698
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:27,540
Oh,
there's no doubt.

1699
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:32,541
The better people you train with,
the better you're going to get and 

1700
01:12:32,541 --> 01:12:32,541
you've got to seek those people out.
You know,

1701
01:12:32,541 --> 01:12:33,420
you got to not mind.
Hey,

1702
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:35,410
that Guy Taylor,
that I'm talking about do,

1703
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:39,030
do I like getting my ass kicked by a guy
that's been training for six months.

1704
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:40,230
No,
I hate it.

1705
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,820
I hate it Taylor.

1706
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:47,030
But guess what?
I call them out every time and I talk 

1707
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,461
smack to him.
I don't talk a bunch of smack talking 

1708
01:12:49,461 --> 01:12:49,461
smack to him.
I'm like,

1709
01:12:49,461 --> 01:12:49,461
Hey,
what's up young buck,

1710
01:12:49,461 --> 01:12:50,210
you want to come get some of this 
everyday?

1711
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,140
Because I want to train with him because
he's that strong need.

1712
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,500
Of course I'm training with Dean,
I'm training with Jeff Glover.

1713
01:12:55,620 --> 01:13:00,620
I train with those guys too,
but the young buck that wants to get 

1714
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:00,620
after it a little bit more.
Yeah,

1715
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:05,361
we'll also.
There's something about freak wrestling 

1716
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:05,361
strength.
That's just.

1717
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:05,750
It doesn't make any sense.
Like I've,

1718
01:13:05,751 --> 01:13:07,230
I've rolled with restaurants before.
I'm like,

1719
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:08,760
okay,
whatever you are.

1720
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:11,390
There's,
there's people and then like,

1721
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:15,090
like chimp chimp person,
you know,

1722
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:20,230
they have like when your body is used to
from the time you're an early kid 

1723
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:23,870
throwing bodies around like your tendon 
strength and your ability to manipulate 

1724
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:26,130
bodies is a very different kind of 
strength.

1725
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:31,130
I mean it might not translate to a 40 
yard dash or or sprint or you know,

1726
01:13:31,291 --> 01:13:34,710
lifting weights,
but there's the physical ability to move

1727
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:37,320
bodies is very unusual.
Yeah,

1728
01:13:37,321 --> 01:13:41,580
and you always have to be careful too 
because there's been plenty of wrestlers

1729
01:13:41,581 --> 01:13:46,581
along the way that don't do well in mma.
They just,

1730
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,210
they're great,
they're strong,

1731
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:52,740
but I think that's a mental thing.
I think they have some limited factor in

1732
01:13:52,741 --> 01:13:55,440
their brain where they go,
they just can't quite open their mind to

1733
01:13:55,441 --> 01:14:00,441
Jujitsu.
They can't quite open their mind to 

1734
01:14:00,441 --> 01:14:02,121
striking.
They can't get out of that wrestler 

1735
01:14:02,121 --> 01:14:02,121
mentality of,
you know this,

1736
01:14:02,121 --> 01:14:07,101
I have to go as hard as I can right now 
because you can't go as hard as you can 

1737
01:14:07,101 --> 01:14:08,070
run out for the whole time.
You will run out of gas.

1738
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,870
Especially with striking.
If you're.

1739
01:14:09,871 --> 01:14:12,040
If you're boxing and with people and you
think

1740
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:17,040
you're just going to go in and do that,
you're going to run into somebody who 

1741
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,561
actually knows how to box and you're 
going to come home with headaches every 

1742
01:14:19,561 --> 01:14:19,561
night.
You're going to get very discouraged.

1743
01:14:19,561 --> 01:14:20,770
It's a matter of who you're training 
with too,

1744
01:14:20,771 --> 01:14:25,771
like as far as your trainer is like,
who's who's coaching you and what 

1745
01:14:25,771 --> 01:14:28,891
methodology are they using and what,
what mindset are they trying to impart 

1746
01:14:28,891 --> 01:14:30,940
on you as far as like skill development 
because there's so many people out there

1747
01:14:30,941 --> 01:14:34,870
that just don't have like a real clear 
philosophy.

1748
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:39,871
Like they don't have a goal.
Like in terms of like I want to work on 

1749
01:14:39,871 --> 01:14:43,810
footwork in avoiding certain shots and 
being able to move in better.

1750
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:46,150
You know,
instead they're just trying to win every

1751
01:14:46,151 --> 01:14:51,151
round or they're trying to push hard and
then do you not get to the next level,

1752
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:54,850
which in my mind when we get past the 
athleticism,

1753
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:59,851
we get past the mental overcoming of 
challenges and then in my opinion,

1754
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:05,100
you get to the next level which is 
creativity and that's when you get to 

1755
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:06,860
Mcgregor,
right?

1756
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:12,150
Jonny Bones Jones,
they're doing things that they're kind 

1757
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:13,510
of making up and they're making them up 
live as they go.

1758
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:15,760
And I think that to me is,
is,

1759
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:16,430
you know,
we kind of,

1760
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:18,460
I think we saw with Bj Penn back in the 
day,

1761
01:15:18,461 --> 01:15:20,860
he was creative,
I think fate or did it where he was,

1762
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:23,650
he was doing creative things.
But I think to me that's,

1763
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:28,890
that's where you go that one level 
higher is when you add the creative 

1764
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:33,031
element to a guy that can take a and B 
and make f out of those things somehow.

1765
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,790
Yeah.
And when you watch those guys,

1766
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,380
there's something about watching a Jon 
Jones or fate or a prime time Bj Penn.

1767
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:46,410
It elevates you.
You watch someone do somethIng special 

1768
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:46,450
like that.
And you just walk out of there,

1769
01:15:46,451 --> 01:15:51,451
you feel like,
I know I can run faster than I could 

1770
01:15:51,451 --> 01:15:51,451
before I saw that fight.

1771
01:15:51,451 --> 01:15:52,300
I know I could.
I could lift more weights.

1772
01:15:52,301 --> 01:15:55,270
I know I could do something better.
Just people.

1773
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:00,480
I think this is a huge thing that one of
the reasons why people enjoy watching 

1774
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,110
all kinds of sports,
but in particular combat sports.

1775
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:07,560
When people do something amazing,
it makes you feel like amazing things 

1776
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,450
are possible.
Yeah.

1777
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:14,130
I actually,
I have limitations on that too because 

1778
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:16,000
personally I'll watch somebody,
you know,

1779
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,640
some random fighter or whatever and I'll
say,

1780
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:19,930
I could,
I could probably do that.

1781
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:20,470
You knoW what I mean?
Like,

1782
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:22,990
I could do that.
That's a good fighter,

1783
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:24,400
but I could.
I'm good at jujitsu.

1784
01:16:24,401 --> 01:16:25,840
I'm pretty good striker.
I could do that.

1785
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:28,540
And then occasionally see a guy and I 
go,

1786
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:29,440
no,
you know what?

1787
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:33,640
I could not do what that guy can do.
It just makes me,

1788
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:34,110
it,
it,

1789
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,200
it's,
it's humbling.

1790
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:36,220
It's humbling.

1791
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,090
I was wanting,
you know,

1792
01:16:37,091 --> 01:16:38,890
Jack Black,
Jack Black.

1793
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:43,210
I was watching Jack Black the other day 
and I look at Jack Black.

1794
01:16:43,211 --> 01:16:45,430
I look at some,
I look at some actor,

1795
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,550
right?
I look at brad pitt and I go,

1796
01:16:48,551 --> 01:16:49,540
what,
what's brad pitt do?

1797
01:16:49,541 --> 01:16:51,790
And I could do what he's doing.
He's talking on the movie screen,

1798
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:53,470
whatever.
I know I'm underestimating this.

1799
01:16:53,471 --> 01:16:54,610
Right?
But that's what I'm thinking.

1800
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:55,360
I'm like,
you know,

1801
01:16:55,361 --> 01:17:00,361
I could do that.
But also I was watching Jack Black and 

1802
01:17:00,361 --> 01:17:01,240
Jack Black was singing and I was like,
I can't do it.

1803
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:04,310
Jack black's doing right there,
respect and prompts to you.

1804
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:06,710
The homeboys got pipes,
right,

1805
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:10,040
got pipes And I looked at the same.
I look

1806
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,760
at,
you know,

1807
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:15,470
at jonny bones jones and I go,
I wouldn't have done what he just did.

1808
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,380
I look at ge at,
at mcgregor and I go,

1809
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:23,530
you know what he's got?
He's got some little spark that I don't 

1810
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:23,530
have.
He's got a flare.

1811
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:23,920
Yeah,
yeah.

1812
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:27,140
There's a flare that mcgregor has.
It's half of what he does.

1813
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,110
I mean,
he's unbelievably talented.

1814
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:35,140
He's got ridiculous power,
but there's also this flare about him 

1815
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:38,980
when he fucking walks in,
they're flinging his arms and then he 

1816
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:39,830
stands there and farm his opponent and 
goes like that.

1817
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:41,660
There's some about him,
the,

1818
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:46,160
the fucking audaciousness of his,
you know,

1819
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:51,161
he's just so ridiculous,
but it was really impressed me when he 

1820
01:17:51,161 --> 01:17:52,570
came back and beat nate.
Really impressed.

1821
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:53,690
I thought it was a very close fight.
I put,

1822
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:58,700
I actually don't have to watch it again.
I usually don't watch fights more than 

1823
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:58,970
once,
but I know it was very,

1824
01:17:58,971 --> 01:17:59,660
very close.

1825
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,720
They could have won that fight.
Yeah,

1826
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,340
I thought so too.
But it didn't.

1827
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,670
And even just as close as it was,
I was impressed and that was,

1828
01:18:07,671 --> 01:18:12,671
I think,
one of the most impressive feats I've 

1829
01:18:12,671 --> 01:18:14,951
seen as far as that mental game.
We're talking about to come back and 

1830
01:18:14,951 --> 01:18:14,951
say,
you know what?

1831
01:18:14,951 --> 01:18:18,880
I'm going to,
I'm going to do it this time that he 

1832
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,380
even wanted to come back 70 again.
That was at one 70,

1833
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,230
right?
The second time.

1834
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:23,060
It was very Impressive.
You know,

1835
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:28,061
a lot of people don't know that he had a
pretty bad staph infection just a few 

1836
01:18:28,061 --> 01:18:31,091
weeks before the first fight and he was 
on some serious antibiotics and that's 

1837
01:18:31,091 --> 01:18:31,940
one of the reasons why he was so 
drained.

1838
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:36,970
Like people are calling you gassed out,
like if you've never taken antibiotics 

1839
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:40,301
before,
you don't know how fucking horrible it 

1840
01:18:40,301 --> 01:18:40,301
is on your gas tank.

1841
01:18:40,301 --> 01:18:41,810
It's one of the weirdest thing ever.
So you can be in great shape.

1842
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,840
You get on a run of antibiotics and your
body's just you gotta fucking thimble 

1843
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,570
gas tank.
There's nothing left.

1844
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,670
You've got no energy for whatever 
reason.

1845
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:51,170
You just can't push yourself through 
stuff.

1846
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,060
And I think that played a factor in that
fight.

1847
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,940
And here's the thing about mcgregor.
He never had a fucking peep about it.

1848
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:59,920
If it wasn't for me talkIng about it,
most people wouldn't even know that.

1849
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:05,010
Yeah,
he's a bad mother fucker and I don't 

1850
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:07,301
know.
I don't mean they said he signed the 

1851
01:19:07,301 --> 01:19:07,301
floyd mayweather deal.
Yep.

1852
01:19:07,301 --> 01:19:07,800
He signed.
When did that happen?

1853
01:19:07,801 --> 01:19:09,060
It didn't happen yesterday.
He,

1854
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:11,450
he has sIgned floyd mayweather.
Has not signed.

1855
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,710
They're negotiating the naloxone.
Yup.

1856
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,170
Pure boxing.
Yeah.

1857
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:17,140
So the right thing.
I'm like,

1858
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:22,150
people click.
I mean maybe he's going to go full 

1859
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:24,110
bernard hopkins just fucking clench and 
hit him in the clench and tie him up and

1860
01:19:24,111 --> 01:19:24,740
rough them up.

1861
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:27,320
And maybe that's the plan,
lean on his neck,

1862
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,790
you know,
just fIght dirty,

1863
01:19:28,791 --> 01:19:30,710
let them take points away.
Who gives a shit logo,

1864
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,800
get disqualified,
don't stand in the middle of the ring 

1865
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:35,960
and try to fuck and shuck and jive with 
them.

1866
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:39,470
But the other thing is,
is not knocking a lot of people out.

1867
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:44,940
You know,
it's a good fight in terms of like to 

1868
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:44,940
see what the fuck happens.
Yeah.

1869
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:47,240
How much money is that gonna make he's 
gonna make a fuck.

1870
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:50,480
Ton of money.
He's gonna make that he estimated.

1871
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:53,510
I don't know if it's true between 75 and
$100,000,000

1872
01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:58,040
on a and then who knows how much floyd's
going to make somewhere in that range to

1873
01:19:58,041 --> 01:19:59,510
maybe more,
probably more.

1874
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:02,540
But I think that it's going to be 
interested.

1875
01:20:02,541 --> 01:20:03,950
First of all,
floyd's 40,

1876
01:20:03,951 --> 01:20:08,951
almost 41.
Floyd's maybe the best defensive boxer 

1877
01:20:08,951 --> 01:20:09,120
that's ever walked the face of the 
planet.

1878
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,500
I mean he's right up there.
And my.

1879
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,510
I mean,
you can go back to willy pap,

1880
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:15,600
a lot of the guys from the old days and 
for sure loma chanko today,

1881
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:20,810
but in terms of overall performance 
against elite fighters over the course 

1882
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:27,231
of his career,
the guy's only been tagged hard like 

1883
01:20:27,231 --> 01:20:29,130
five or six times ever.
He's a fucking freak and hard work.

1884
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:29,860
I mean,
he,

1885
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:31,650
he's uh,
you look at him,

1886
01:20:31,651 --> 01:20:33,840
he's throwing money around driving 
bentleys,

1887
01:20:33,841 --> 01:20:37,590
but that fucking guy will get on the 
strip and he'll be running miles at 3:00

1888
01:20:37,591 --> 01:20:39,290
in the morning.
He opens up hIs gym,

1889
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:40,020
3:00
in the morning,

1890
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:42,010
just does 15 rounds of the bag.
Just,

1891
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:43,800
he works hard.
I mean,

1892
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:45,150
I don't know if he works that hard 
anymore.

1893
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:47,840
That'll be an interesting one.
Fuck yeah,

1894
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,830
I'll watch it.
I hope it goes down.

1895
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,040
He might get as connor,
my kid his ass handed to him,

1896
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:54,060
but he might not.

1897
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,790
He might tack floyd.
I mean if he can.

1898
01:20:57,030 --> 01:21:02,030
Connor is very good at closing distance 
and snapping off like lead shots.

1899
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:05,340
Like that's one of the things that he 
did with nate and he's a southpaw.

1900
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:10,410
If he can just snap off one or two clean
shots and make an interesting,

1901
01:21:10,411 --> 01:21:12,300
it'll be fun.
I don't know if he can.

1902
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,910
I don't know what he can do.
Straight box.

1903
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:19,290
It's so hard to judge.
Come on to judge without,

1904
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,670
without knowing,
without soon.

1905
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:23,160
And if they do do it,
I think they're going to do it somewhere

1906
01:21:23,161 --> 01:21:25,290
around september.
I think that's the idea.

1907
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:28,390
Jesus christ.
So what's he doing with the ufc?

1908
01:21:28,391 --> 01:21:29,460
But until then,
nothing.

1909
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:34,490
Nothing.
So the lightweight division is on 

1910
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,330
hostage right now.
They're being held hostage interim 

1911
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,520
something or whatever.
I'm supposed to do that.

1912
01:21:38,521 --> 01:21:42,030
But fucking habib.
Norma got sick trying to make the weight

1913
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:42,870
and didn't make the way.

1914
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:45,030
What happened there?
Tony ferguson and habib.

1915
01:21:45,031 --> 01:21:46,590
We're supposed to fight in a bebes 
liver.

1916
01:21:46,591 --> 01:21:48,150
Shut down.
Yeah,

1917
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:49,800
he's cuttIng too much weight.
These guys,

1918
01:21:49,801 --> 01:21:51,660
they get too fucking big.
You know,

1919
01:21:51,661 --> 01:21:54,480
they get up to 190 and they try to get 
down to 1:55

1920
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:57,030
and he couldn't make it.
Was he walking around at one point?

1921
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,260
I don't know.
That's what I heard.

1922
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:02,070
I don't know what he really weighed,
but he's a bad motherfucker.

1923
01:22:02,071 --> 01:22:02,550
Yeah,
for sure.

1924
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:05,850
Habib's grappling is so super high 
level.

1925
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:11,120
I want to see.
I wanted to see that fight so bad 

1926
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:11,250
because tony ferguson is a fucking 
savage.

1927
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:15,180
He's a straight savage,
so him versus habib,

1928
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:18,120
like I watched that fight with him and 
edson barboza again the other day,

1929
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:23,540
crazy fucking wild blood bath until tony
caught him with a doris was a fucking 

1930
01:22:24,091 --> 01:22:29,091
amazing fight.
Like that's the guy I want to see fight 

1931
01:22:29,091 --> 01:22:30,810
a guy who's one of the only guys 
undefeated at the top level of the game,

1932
01:22:30,811 --> 01:22:31,530
which is habib.

1933
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:36,560
He said only god.
It's like a top contender that's 

1934
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:36,800
undefeated and it's smashed everybody in
front of it.

1935
01:22:36,801 --> 01:22:38,460
How much longer until he can fight 
again.

1936
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,010
Who knows if you'll ever be able to make
1:55

1937
01:22:41,011 --> 01:22:42,510
again.
who knows?

1938
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:45,540
Who knows what kind of damage was done 
to his body and these rapid,

1939
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,880
rapid,
horrible weight cuts.

1940
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:49,500
I don't know,
man.

1941
01:22:49,501 --> 01:22:51,810
I don't.
I don't know his medical history,

1942
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:56,811
his medical history or medical issues,
but I know before the Michael Johnson 

1943
01:22:56,811 --> 01:22:57,300
fight,
apparently he had a similar problem.

1944
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:00,690
He made the weight,
but apparently it was real touch and go,

1945
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:03,240
yeah,
can't do that.

1946
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:05,510
No,
you got to cut your calories back.

1947
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:08,560
You mean you want to suffer,
cut your calories back,

1948
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,990
do a lot of fucking running,
drop some body weight.

1949
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,640
You're going to have to and it can be 
done.

1950
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:17,670
It can be done.
You have to do it because rapid 

1951
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:18,280
dehydration,
you're going to fucking die.

1952
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:23,340
Someone's going to die in the ufc is 
just pass some new weight cutting rules 

1953
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:24,780
and new weight classes.
It was like.

1954
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:28,150
This is from andy foster.
Andy fosters the guy who runs California

1955
01:23:28,151 --> 01:23:32,170
as a state athletic commission and he is
such a fucking animal.

1956
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:36,700
Any foster is one of the most important 
guys in terms of like commission.

1957
01:23:36,701 --> 01:23:40,120
The guys who run commissions in mma,
he's like one of the most proactive,

1958
01:23:40,121 --> 01:23:42,640
one of the most knowledgeable and one of
the very best,

1959
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:47,641
maybe the best.
He's so on the ball and so he's pushed 

1960
01:23:47,641 --> 01:23:50,200
hard for these new weight classes and 
these new weight cutting regulations and

1961
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:52,960
such a fucking smart thing.
That guy's.

1962
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:56,640
That guy's awesome man.
I like the 25 weight class.

1963
01:23:56,910 --> 01:23:59,530
Even the one 95.
Weight class 10,

1964
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:03,520
they should skip 70 and do 10 every.
Every two.

1965
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:04,630
Twenty five.
Thirty five,

1966
01:24:04,631 --> 01:24:05,440
45.
Fifty five,

1967
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:05,980
65.

1968
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,050
Just go 10.
Every 10 is good.

1969
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:09,220
10.
Makes sense.

1970
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:14,540
When you got to like 70 and then you've 
got 85 and they get 85 and two.

1971
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:16,030
Oh five.
That's too many.

1972
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:21,060
That's too many pounds.
I mean gsp versus what were they going 

1973
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:21,310
to.
Gsp versus bisping?

1974
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:26,460
Yeah.
I've tried to explain this to people 

1975
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:26,460
because I've been in the room and stood 
next to those guys.

1976
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,910
Busy being is a big,
big,

1977
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:29,420
big man.
He is.

1978
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:34,570
The gsp is a normal sized guy.
I don't see how that fight was going to 

1979
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,250
be fair.
You know?

1980
01:24:36,251 --> 01:24:41,140
Also bisping is currently active.
Gsp took years off.

1981
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:44,080
Bisping is capable of fighting at 55.
He says.

1982
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:47,290
Bisping said he could make 55.
Wow.

1983
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:50,800
Yeah,
so if he wins at one 81,

1984
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:55,801
85,
he has thought about fighting either at 

1985
01:24:55,801 --> 01:24:56,890
one 70 or at 1:55.
Like what the fuck?

1986
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:57,960
He's a big dude straw.

1987
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:00,430
I've trained with him.
He's a big strong.

1988
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:01,690
He's what?
Six two,

1989
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:02,970
something like that.
bisping.

1990
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,930
He's tall,
he's big.

1991
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:07,450
He's got a fucking incredible cardio for
sure.

1992
01:25:07,451 --> 01:25:08,770
He's a hard worker.
Yeah.

1993
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:14,130
Yeah.
That guy is a perfect example of just 

1994
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:16,381
like the ultimate,
like bulldog mindset and just refusing 

1995
01:25:16,381 --> 01:25:20,350
and now looking at is the chair and he 
took that fight on a week's notice,

1996
01:25:20,351 --> 01:25:23,410
two weeks notice against rockhold when 
that's not even that.

1997
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:28,440
I think it Was a few days.
I think it was like 11 days notice or 

1998
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:29,410
something crazy.
Just being pissed.

1999
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:33,970
Talking shits.
Dana white on twitter because he was mad

2000
01:25:33,971 --> 01:25:38,971
at gsp.
Got a title shot and he hasn't earned 

2001
01:25:38,971 --> 01:25:38,971
the title shot.
Yeah.

2002
01:25:38,971 --> 01:25:39,850
He's like,
what the fuck the gsb do and oh man,

2003
01:25:39,851 --> 01:25:44,851
the whole,
the whole way classes in a flux and 

2004
01:25:44,851 --> 01:25:47,041
there's a funny meme of a [inaudible].
Bisping said that he's his knees hurt 

2005
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:51,250
because they said that the ufc said they
want them to fight you el ramiro because

2006
01:25:51,251 --> 01:25:53,560
the gsp fight is off.
And he's like,

2007
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:54,850
oh,
actually my knees hurt.

2008
01:25:54,851 --> 01:25:56,590
So uh,
I could wait for gsp.

2009
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,020
He was like,
I can't really train right now.

2010
01:25:59,021 --> 01:26:04,021
I'm good.
I'm just going to sit back and take a 

2011
01:26:04,021 --> 01:26:04,021
little break.
So there's a funny meme,

2012
01:26:04,021 --> 01:26:06,740
gsp,
michael bisping in the hospital bed that

2013
01:26:06,741 --> 01:26:09,620
says bisping be like,
I'll just sit here and wait for gsp.

2014
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:14,390
Yoel savage,
terrifying.

2015
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,850
But that really bummed me out.
When tim kennedy asked him,

2016
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:18,350
well,
that was cheating.

2017
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:19,520
Yeah.
That shouldn't have happened.

2018
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:21,920
Was cheating and that,
that was horrible.

2019
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:23,810
Tim did a little bit of cheating.
That fight too.

2020
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,310
What do you do?
He grabbed his gloves.

2021
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:30,790
He's grabbed the inside of the glove,
punched him in the face a couple times 

2022
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:30,790
while I was holding urls.
Glove,

2023
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:33,980
but do.
But people show that in slow motion.

2024
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:37,250
But what they don't understand is you're
showing slow motion,

2025
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:41,090
like it looks like he's holding onto it 
for awhile and punching in real life.

2026
01:26:41,091 --> 01:26:42,950
It was less than a second or maybe a 
second,

2027
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:48,190
and it's probably just chaos and he's 
grabbing something just throwing shit 

2028
01:26:48,591 --> 01:26:51,620
whether or not he actually knew that he 
had his glove consciously.

2029
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:55,340
The gloves make a really big difference.
Huge grappling.

2030
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,590
Huge.
You got to train with them.

2031
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:58,920
If you're going to fight with them,
you know,

2032
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,200
secure and chokes.
I mean,

2033
01:27:00,201 --> 01:27:02,420
even damien maia,
you see him get rear naked,

2034
01:27:02,421 --> 01:27:04,610
choke with a hand on top of the head,
like old school,

2035
01:27:04,611 --> 01:27:06,620
ken shamrock style.
Like he'll,

2036
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:11,650
he'll,
because he can't get the hand back 

2037
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:13,181
there.
He just can't get it and people start 

2038
01:27:13,181 --> 01:27:16,511
grabbing new idea.
Team people are grabbing the inside of 

2039
01:27:16,511 --> 01:27:16,511
that glove.
It's hard.

2040
01:27:16,511 --> 01:27:17,420
It's a lot harder to finish stuff.
People have gloves on.

2041
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:18,920
Well,
some people finish with it.

2042
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:22,070
Josh thompson used to grab his own 
glove,

2043
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:24,890
which you can do.
You can get deep in there.

2044
01:27:24,891 --> 01:27:26,780
I saw him choke somebody out with that.
I was like,

2045
01:27:26,781 --> 01:27:28,040
woo,
you can do that.

2046
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:31,550
I think you can grab your own glove and 
that makes a nice handle if you can slip

2047
01:27:31,551 --> 01:27:33,170
your fingers in there to train with 
them.

2048
01:27:33,171 --> 01:27:34,730
If you're going to fight with them,
you have to have,

2049
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:39,970
oh,
it's amazing how hard it is to choke 

2050
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:40,220
people when you have those,
especially those gloves.

2051
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:43,640
A big pat of ones.
Even marcello garcia was having a really

2052
01:27:43,641 --> 01:27:46,640
hard time with it.
When he had his one loan mma fight,

2053
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:49,040
he had this dude's back and he couldn't 
finish them in.

2054
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:52,520
A lot of it is because of those.
Does that make a big difference?

2055
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,410
They really do.
I don't think you should wear gloves.

2056
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:56,360
I really don't.
I totally agree with you.

2057
01:27:56,450 --> 01:28:01,450
I think fighting.
If you could kick somebody in the shin 

2058
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:01,490
to the face,
like you can shoot somebody in the face,

2059
01:28:01,491 --> 01:28:06,491
but you can't knuckle in the middle.
I think it would be so helpful for all 

2060
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:09,491
the head trauma that's happening.
If they took off the gloves and you add 

2061
01:28:09,491 --> 01:28:11,090
either strike with an open palm or you 
had to pay the price because I might hit

2062
01:28:11,091 --> 01:28:16,091
you twice before I broke my hand and now
I'm going to be grappling with you and 

2063
01:28:16,091 --> 01:28:16,091
trying to take her down.

2064
01:28:16,091 --> 01:28:20,200
I don't think people understand that,
that if someone just ducks their head 

2065
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:21,020
down and you hit them with a straight 
punch to the forehead,

2066
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:24,320
you are very likely to break your hand.
I don't think you'd be able to wrap your

2067
01:28:24,321 --> 01:28:25,970
hands either.
I really don't.

2068
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:27,310
That would be awesome.
That would be.

2069
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:32,320
You should have.
I think you should have a cop on and a 

2070
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,680
mouthpiece and shorts and I really think
that's it.

2071
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:35,150
I mean,
and people like,

2072
01:28:35,151 --> 01:28:36,290
oh,
you're a fucking idiot.

2073
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:38,220
You're a barbarian.
They need to cover the globe.

2074
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:38,870
No,
they don't.

2075
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,520
You're,
you're less of a barbarian.

2076
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:45,790
You make yourself.
You make yourself more able to hit 

2077
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:48,200
someone and you don't really help them 
at all.

2078
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:50,330
Like it's harder to hit someone bare 
knuckle.

2079
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:51,180
Yeah.
Like it's,

2080
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:55,970
it's more realistic.
I wish they would make that change and I

2081
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,000
wish that would change everything,
but when you can elbow somebody but you 

2082
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:01,000
can't bare knuckle,
that's crazy.

2083
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,490
Your knuckles are way more vulnerable.

2084
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:06,600
Like gets way harder to to get that off 
until you wrap it up.

2085
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:09,810
Then you make it like a cast.
You wrap it up and you get some.

2086
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,420
You'll look like a nice stiff 
restaurant.

2087
01:29:12,421 --> 01:29:13,980
We rips.
Risk isn't going anywhere.

2088
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,500
Buckling and flexing.
When you punched someone,

2089
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:18,940
it's hard core when they wrap up those 
hands.

2090
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:23,990
Boy,
like even like holding pads for guys 

2091
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:23,990
when we're backstage getting ready to 
take there.

2092
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:24,710
Did they just turn it up?
Yeah.

2093
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,180
Yeah,
but they'll never make that change.

2094
01:29:27,181 --> 01:29:32,181
I don't saY I don't think it should and 
I think for really for the head trauma 

2095
01:29:32,181 --> 01:29:35,811
of the people that are fighting is that 
that's really needed for sure the head 

2096
01:29:35,811 --> 01:29:39,450
all those times and it's not good for,
you know,

2097
01:29:39,451 --> 01:29:44,451
it's not good for you.
And agaIn that goes back to the 

2098
01:29:44,451 --> 01:29:44,451
grappling thing.
I think we see more submissions.

2099
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:49,520
I think it would be way easier to catch 
people with stuff like it'd be way 

2100
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,300
easier to secure good teens and chokes.
It's just you,

2101
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,240
you,
you wouldn't have all these restrIctions

2102
01:29:54,241 --> 01:29:57,330
of having something on your hands.
Your hands need to be able to articulate

2103
01:29:57,331 --> 01:30:02,331
and move to secure certain grips and 
you'd see you'd see a lot more 

2104
01:30:02,331 --> 01:30:06,771
submissions.
I think it's too bad they don't make 

2105
01:30:06,771 --> 01:30:06,771
that change.
it'd be better for everyone.

2106
01:30:06,771 --> 01:30:06,771
Yeah.
I mean,

2107
01:30:06,771 --> 01:30:08,700
I remember when I first started working 
for the ufc,

2108
01:30:08,701 --> 01:30:13,701
you didn't have to wear gloves.
Vituro was one of the first guys to 

2109
01:30:13,701 --> 01:30:16,221
wear.
I'm victorian tank tank was one of the 

2110
01:30:16,221 --> 01:30:18,141
first guys ever to wear gloves and he 
wore those gloves that he was wearing 

2111
01:30:18,141 --> 01:30:19,980
were like old school century martial 
arts,

2112
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:23,370
chuck norris gloves like nobody had even
thought to wear those.

2113
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:26,790
I think tank was like the innovator,
the innovator for sure.

2114
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,050
Then vito or innovative design head.
Yeah,

2115
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:30,540
but,
but pop,

2116
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:30,780
pop,
pop,

2117
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:31,020
pop,
pop,

2118
01:30:31,021 --> 01:30:31,380
pop,
pop.

2119
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:32,750
Damn.
And v tour.

2120
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:37,170
In the early days I was there,
his first fight in 1997.

2121
01:30:37,171 --> 01:30:40,410
The first time ufc 12.
Nobody had seen anything like that.

2122
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:45,030
This guy comes in with this blazing hand
speed built like a fucking greek god and

2123
01:30:45,031 --> 01:30:46,530
everybody's like,
oh jesus,

2124
01:30:46,531 --> 01:30:49,520
what do you do with this fucking kid?
That was,

2125
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:53,400
that was interesting.
And of course we all hurt because I was,

2126
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:54,960
you know,
jujitsu guy at that time were like,

2127
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:59,990
oh,
he's only a purple belt is what we were 

2128
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:01,641
hearing.
And they gave him this black belt just 

2129
01:31:01,641 --> 01:31:01,641
because he's doing this flight and blah 
blah blah.

2130
01:31:01,641 --> 01:31:01,641
He's only a purple belt and he comes out
just,

2131
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:05,140
what Is it,
13 punches to the face but pop pop.

2132
01:31:05,141 --> 01:31:06,600
And then he did the same thing to 
vandelay pop,

2133
01:31:06,601 --> 01:31:06,870
pop,
pop,

2134
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:07,260
pop,
pop,

2135
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:09,480
straight punches down the pipe.

2136
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:10,580
Crazy.
Yeah.

2137
01:31:10,581 --> 01:31:12,400
When he fought vandelay was wearing 
shoes.

2138
01:31:12,401 --> 01:31:17,401
I remember that he was wearing like 
wrestling shoes because all these wacky 

2139
01:31:17,401 --> 01:31:18,990
rules back then,
it's really interesting to see like from

2140
01:31:18,991 --> 01:31:23,991
1993 to 2017,
how far fighting has changed and how 

2141
01:31:24,181 --> 01:31:29,181
much we know about it now.
I always say that fighting in 1992 was 

2142
01:31:31,201 --> 01:31:33,130
theoretical and,
and we,

2143
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:33,840
you know,
some,

2144
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:35,950
somebody will say something to me on the
internet like hey you know,

2145
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:40,200
what about this martial art or whatever.
And I'm like what do you think of this?

2146
01:31:40,201 --> 01:31:40,730
And I'm like,
ah,

2147
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:44,550
you just no reason to theorize.
Not only do we know from the ufc,

2148
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:48,480
we also have been a now a country at war
for whatever,

2149
01:31:48,481 --> 01:31:53,481
15 years.
So all of our guys been going overseas 

2150
01:31:53,481 --> 01:31:54,300
and doing the same stuff all in combat.
So we know what works.

2151
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:55,620
There's no,
there's no big question anymore.

2152
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:56,820
Right.
It's not like,

2153
01:31:56,850 --> 01:32:01,850
oh,
I wonder what happens if you poke a guy 

2154
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:01,850
in the.
I know.

2155
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:01,850
We know what happens.
We know what happens.

2156
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:02,620
Yeah.
It's pretty obvious.

2157
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:07,920
It's not good.
He here's another thing like like wing 

2158
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:07,920
chung and things like that.
Like,

2159
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:07,920
yeah,
that'll work.

2160
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,480
If the guy doesn't know what the fuck 
he's doing and you chain punch them,

2161
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:11,830
don't.
It's not good.

2162
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:15,130
Hit somebody 17 times in the head are 
not expecting that.

2163
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:16,960
He's never trained before.
Definitely not good.

2164
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:19,720
Very effective.
Are you going to get that off on someone

2165
01:32:19,721 --> 01:32:22,660
who actually knows what they're doing?
I don't know,

2166
01:32:22,661 --> 01:32:27,661
man.
Let me get that off on a high school 

2167
01:32:27,661 --> 01:32:27,661
wrestler.
Good luck.

2168
01:32:27,661 --> 01:32:30,770
Good luck.
You're going flying into your head on 

2169
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:30,770
the curb.
Yeah.

2170
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:31,450
It just.
It just seems to me that like.

2171
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:36,510
Did you see that video?
That is becoming a huge issue in China 

2172
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:40,110
as a chinese tai chi master tried to 
fight an mma fighter and just got a 

2173
01:32:40,110 --> 01:32:43,240
glitter rated in 10 seconds and this guy
has had to hide.

2174
01:32:43,450 --> 01:32:48,450
This chinese mma fighters had to go into
hiding because people are offended that 

2175
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:51,790
he battered this tai chee master and 
made their country look bad because it's

2176
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:56,791
making their,
their traditional martial art look 

2177
01:32:56,791 --> 01:32:57,170
ineffective.
That's not a.

2178
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:59,430
That doesn't make sense to me.
Here.

2179
01:32:59,610 --> 01:33:04,610
we can watch this real quick,
but I don't know why the fuck this guy 

2180
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:04,720
didn't understand what was going to 
happen when they fought.

2181
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:09,780
They sometimes.
I think they actually believe what 

2182
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:11,140
they're saying.
This is so brutal though.

2183
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:14,140
This chee guy.
What's really bizarre is tight.

2184
01:33:14,141 --> 01:33:17,710
She's not really a physical fighting 
martial art.

2185
01:33:18,010 --> 01:33:21,360
It's supposed to be somethIng that's 
more of like a meditative yoga.

2186
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:23,740
It's like a yoga deal.
It's supposed to be grateful.

2187
01:33:23,741 --> 01:33:25,600
I had one of my,
one of my buddIes,

2188
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:27,970
a black belt,
a guy named jeff higgs,

2189
01:33:27,971 --> 01:33:32,110
old school jujitsu guy,
and he got told by a thai guy,

2190
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:33,820
you know,
you can't take me down.

2191
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:36,850
Oh god.
And my buddy see that.

2192
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:40,330
Yeah,
I mean that guy just got obliterated and

2193
01:33:40,331 --> 01:33:44,320
the only way you can ever actually know 
what would happen if someone punches you

2194
01:33:44,321 --> 01:33:47,800
in the face is to train.
That way if you just have these ideas in

2195
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:49,180
your head,
you're going to stand in front of them.

2196
01:33:49,181 --> 01:33:52,120
This guy just oozing blood all over the 
place and he's getting up.

2197
01:33:52,121 --> 01:33:55,750
He's battered his nose shattered,
wobbly.

2198
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,670
I guess first time it's ever been 
punched.

2199
01:33:57,690 --> 01:34:02,690
Maybe the mma guy should have,
if he had a little bit more foresight.

2200
01:34:03,401 --> 01:34:08,401
and what was gonna happen?
He should've come out and you're like 

2201
01:34:08,401 --> 01:34:08,401
really done the whole,
you know,

2202
01:34:08,401 --> 01:34:12,661
respect and then the bow and then all 
this stuff and then after defeated him 

2203
01:34:12,661 --> 01:34:15,411
should have helped him if he,
if he maybe that would have helped him 

2204
01:34:15,411 --> 01:34:16,060
from a,
from a political standpoint.

2205
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:17,920
Uh,
but Yeah,

2206
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:20,310
he can wonder.
But,

2207
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:25,350
you know,
it seems to me that this is something 

2208
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:27,061
that they need to see.
They really do because there's too many 

2209
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:27,670
people out there that are just buying 
into this foolish shit.

2210
01:34:27,710 --> 01:34:28,630
we'll,
like I said,

2211
01:34:28,631 --> 01:34:30,420
so my buddy jeff higgs got this,
uh,

2212
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:32,650
this,
I think it was an aikido guy.

2213
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,390
Does I?
Quito people say cI and all that.

2214
01:34:34,690 --> 01:34:36,970
I don't know ci,
they probably do.

2215
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Well,
depends on which asshole you're talking 

2216
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:42,000
to them,
whether it was I quito or whether it was

2217
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,180
a tie chee,
I forget,

2218
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:44,390
but the guy says,
you know,

2219
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:49,410
hey,
I'm a martial artist and once I settle 

2220
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:49,410
my ci,
you,

2221
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:53,970
you can't even take me down.
So how are you going to do jujitsu on 

2222
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:53,970
me?
And he says,

2223
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:56,701
weLl,
what do you mean you can settle your 

2224
01:34:56,701 --> 01:34:56,701
cheeks as you know,
I,

2225
01:34:56,701 --> 01:34:56,701
once I sent her my ci and it's based 
into the ground,

2226
01:34:56,701 --> 01:34:59,330
you won't be able to move me,
you can try if you want.

2227
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:02,120
And my friend higgs goes,
okay,

2228
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:07,330
cool.
Tell me when your cheese all centered 

2229
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:09,970
and the guy you know,
does thIs little thing and then settled 

2230
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:09,970
this g.
And he says,

2231
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:09,970
okay,
I'm ready.

2232
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:10,130
And jeff just did.
I mean,

2233
01:35:10,131 --> 01:35:12,200
it's no big deal,
just hit a double leg on a boom,

2234
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:14,330
you know,
like you can't stop a double leg without

2235
01:35:14,331 --> 01:35:16,370
defending here when I was bawling and 
yeah,

2236
01:35:16,371 --> 01:35:21,371
so,
so let's say the guy actually believed 

2237
01:35:21,371 --> 01:35:25,720
that the guy actually believed that 
that's the type of mental illness it is.

2238
01:35:26,931 --> 01:35:28,100
BuT I mean,
you know,

2239
01:35:28,101 --> 01:35:29,270
it's flat earth,
right?

2240
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:31,850
It's this.
I want to bring that up right now,

2241
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:37,220
but it's so often on this podcast,
I've got a couple people that are now.

2242
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,770
Every time I talk about jujitsu at all,
they're like flat earth,

2243
01:35:39,771 --> 01:35:41,030
flat earth.
They believe it.

2244
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:44,210
People believe it.
I get fucking shit every day from people

2245
01:35:44,211 --> 01:35:47,360
that are flatter with supporters that 
are mad at me for exposing.

2246
01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:49,220
They just want to believe it.
That's real.

2247
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:52,090
It is.
It is a weird thing with,

2248
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:57,160
and by the way,
one of the main guys who send a flat 

2249
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,861
earth makes,
has a whole vIdeo about how jujitsu 

2250
01:35:59,861 --> 01:36:02,141
doesn't work and it's about wing chung 
isn't there like one of his biggest 

2251
01:36:02,141 --> 01:36:02,141
videos on this page?
Yeah,

2252
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:07,700
it's hilarious.
But there is something about people 

2253
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:10,961
wanting to believe that there's 
mysteries and secrets that there's some 

2254
01:36:10,961 --> 01:36:11,230
secret power,
like,

2255
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:12,410
and that,
you know,

2256
01:36:12,411 --> 01:36:17,411
the idea that you could just center 
yourself and a college wrestler can't 

2257
01:36:17,411 --> 01:36:20,831
take you down.
That's one of my new thIngs that I tell 

2258
01:36:20,831 --> 01:36:20,900
people with youtube because I used to 
say like,

2259
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:23,070
jujitsu is magic because it kind of is,
you know,

2260
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:26,210
when you know jujitsu,
you can do things that are almost magic.

2261
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:28,040
But then when you're teaching somebody 
for the first time,

2262
01:36:28,041 --> 01:36:28,550
I'm always like,
look,

2263
01:36:28,551 --> 01:36:30,050
it's an,
it's not magic.

2264
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:35,170
It's,
I always shown when somebody the other 

2265
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:35,170
day,
uh,

2266
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:37,720
you know,
elbow escape or something from the 

2267
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:37,720
mount.
And the guy's like,

2268
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:37,720
hey,
you know,

2269
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:37,720
he's,
he's,

2270
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:40,370
it's really hard to do because he keeps 
pulling my arm away,

2271
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:41,520
you know?
And I was like,

2272
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,040
yeah,
it's a fight urine.

2273
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:45,500
It's not magic.
It's you have to fight against the other

2274
01:36:45,501 --> 01:36:50,501
person to another human.
I Just told him what to do and I told 

2275
01:36:50,501 --> 01:36:50,501
you what to do.
Now you've got to fight for it.

2276
01:36:50,501 --> 01:36:51,500
You've got to figure out how to get to 
the right position.

2277
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:55,030
It's not magic,
but it is weird that people that,

2278
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:55,660
you know,
they're,

2279
01:36:55,661 --> 01:36:59,130
they're looking for something to believe
in I guess,

2280
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:01,770
and maybe they just want a contrarian 
viewpoints,

2281
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:03,740
so that's why they picked saying that 
the earth is flat.

2282
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:05,820
Well,
I also think it's,

2283
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:08,960
it's sorta the same thing with people 
wanting shortcoming from going down this

2284
01:37:08,961 --> 01:37:09,690
road right now.

2285
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:13,100
I just want to walk away and of podcast.
I'm out.

2286
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:15,440
people love shortcuts.
They love,

2287
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:20,120
they love,
like throwing out the entire paradigm of

2288
01:37:20,121 --> 01:37:22,640
modern civilization.
It's all based on a lie.

2289
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:26,410
We're not on a globe worn a flat disc 
deal.

2290
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:29,730
Universe spins around us like,
you know,

2291
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:34,190
people that just like to argue is this 
maybe just people that like to argue and

2292
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,440
have a country that could be some of 
them for sure.

2293
01:37:36,441 --> 01:37:38,450
That could be some of them.
For some of them,

2294
01:37:38,451 --> 01:37:43,451
I think it's just that there are people 
that straight up just straight up 

2295
01:37:43,451 --> 01:37:46,470
believed that the earth is 100 percent.
One hundred percent your soul.

2296
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:47,260
Yeah,
yeah,

2297
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:48,710
yeah.
They really belIeve it.

2298
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,050
But there's also people that joined the 
moonies.

2299
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:56,340
You know,
there's people that joined silent 

2300
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:56,340
scientology.
Yeah,

2301
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:56,340
I mean,
look,

2302
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:56,340
there's people

2303
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:58,510
out there that'll suck a dick if they 
think it will make them live forever.

2304
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:01,370
They suck your dick on my live forever.
Yes,

2305
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:06,530
the knowledge will flow through you,
but you have to believe down in san 

2306
01:38:06,530 --> 01:38:07,740
diego,
I don't know what it was 10 years ago,

2307
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:09,660
15 years ago,
they had that heaven's gate thing.

2308
01:38:09,661 --> 01:38:11,460
We're Almost done.
Those purple shoes,

2309
01:38:11,461 --> 01:38:13,890
they put on the purple nike's and they 
killed themselves in.

2310
01:38:13,891 --> 01:38:17,640
The comment was flying by and it shows 
you again,

2311
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:22,660
you know,
now we're talking about the human mind 

2312
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:26,121
is just so complicated and complex that 
it's grasping for something to believe 

2313
01:38:26,121 --> 01:38:27,210
in and some people aren't gonna believe 
in anything.

2314
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:28,620
Yeah.
Well,

2315
01:38:28,621 --> 01:38:33,621
you know,
it's one of the things that guy richie 

2316
01:38:33,621 --> 01:38:35,091
brought up the other day about your book
extreme ownership and It's one thing 

2317
01:38:35,091 --> 01:38:38,361
that I think you and I are both really 
focused on is the way the brain works 

2318
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:44,390
and the way the mind works,
and this is one of the things that I 

2319
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:45,990
think that you reinforce with these big 
photos of your watch every day.

2320
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:51,530
It's like the mind works in very 
peculiar ways and you can and it's kind 

2321
01:38:51,721 --> 01:38:54,480
of pliable and you could force it into 
positive,

2322
01:38:54,481 --> 01:38:56,580
productive ways.
You can.

2323
01:38:56,581 --> 01:39:01,581
You can,
you can express yourself in these very 

2324
01:39:01,581 --> 01:39:03,320
positive productive ways and in,
in,

2325
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:07,620
in carve those grooves of productivity 
and of advancement.

2326
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:10,110
Well,
it's what you're talking about it.

2327
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:15,150
we just talked about the moonies and the
scientology where people are trying to 

2328
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:16,080
do mind control and when I talk about 
mind control,

2329
01:39:16,081 --> 01:39:17,400
I'm talking about controlling your own 
mind.

2330
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:22,740
You know,
you can make yourself exactly what 

2331
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:22,740
you're just saying.
You can make yourself and force yourself

2332
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:25,950
to do things and once you get in that 
groove and get in that habit,

2333
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:30,060
it becomes part of you and that becomes 
who you are and why not be that person.

2334
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:33,390
Then the other person that's not doing 
positive things.

2335
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:38,900
Yeah,
but people like people like to also 

2336
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:38,970
pretend that the way they're doing it as
the right way,

2337
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:44,000
they don't want to be open to the idea 
that there's some other method that's 

2338
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,300
maybe more productive and more 
successful who?

2339
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:46,510
Well,
there's the downfall.

2340
01:39:46,511 --> 01:39:47,790
I mean,
and that's,

2341
01:39:48,050 --> 01:39:48,740
you know,
again,

2342
01:39:48,741 --> 01:39:53,741
and I,
I think this is one of the reasons why 

2343
01:39:53,741 --> 01:39:55,851
your show is so popular and why people 
listen to you because you,

2344
01:39:56,411 --> 01:39:57,660
you,
you listen to other people,

2345
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:02,820
right?
People listen to you because you listen 

2346
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:02,820
to other people.
You listen to what they have to say.

2347
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:02,820
You go,
okay,

2348
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,900
that's an interesting viewpoint.
It hadn't heard that before and you.

2349
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:07,560
I'm the same way when somebody tells me,
hey,

2350
01:40:07,561 --> 01:40:09,600
this is what I believe.
I don't say,

2351
01:40:09,601 --> 01:40:10,500
well,
I don't believe that.

2352
01:40:10,501 --> 01:40:11,640
I believe something else.
I go,

2353
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:13,980
that's interesting.
That's an interesting viewpoint.

2354
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:19,010
Yeah.
I always want to try to see things from 

2355
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:19,010
other people's perspective and it's hard
because the brain wants to go,

2356
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:20,760
fuck this guy,
this guy,

2357
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:22,170
no shit.
You're,

2358
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:22,920
you're right,
dude,

2359
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:27,950
this guy's wrong.
But you always got to like pause and 

2360
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:27,950
think.

2361
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:27,950
I mean,
again,

2362
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:31,521
I hate to bring this back up,
but that could easily be what's also 

2363
01:40:31,521 --> 01:40:33,861
going on with the flat earth thing 
because they have this idea in their 

2364
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:33,861
head and then someone's,
you know,

2365
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:36,030
there's no photos of the earth other 
than composites.

2366
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:40,020
If there really was around earth,
you'd be able to see a hole and you go,

2367
01:40:40,021 --> 01:40:45,021
oh,
actually there's a photo taken every 10 

2368
01:40:45,021 --> 01:40:45,021
minutes from 22,000
miles away,

2369
01:40:45,021 --> 01:40:45,430
have the full earth,
whoa,

2370
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:47,140
well that's not true.
Well,

2371
01:40:47,190 --> 01:40:52,190
that's fake,
and they get into this thing and they 

2372
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:54,070
get into this thing because they don't 
want to ever and pause and

2373
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,010
look at the way they're thinking versus 
the way other people were thinking,

2374
01:40:57,020 --> 01:41:02,020
okay,
did I get myself in a fucking trap here 

2375
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:03,730
that I get myself into an intellectual 
trap where I'm supporting an idea that's

2376
01:41:03,731 --> 01:41:08,731
not true and now I'm reinforcing that in
my head and I'm fucking tightening up 

2377
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:13,120
all my my borders and trying to figure 
out a way to not let new ideas in and to

2378
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:18,270
to reinforce my old ideas.
You know your podcast with Jordan 

2379
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:18,270
Peterson the other day.
He kind of brought that up,

2380
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:22,801
which by the way,
if anyone hasn't listened to that 

2381
01:41:22,801 --> 01:41:22,801
podcast,
that's.

2382
01:41:22,801 --> 01:41:23,170
That's gotta be one of the best podcasts
that I've ever heard.

2383
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:28,200
He's a mindblower unbelievable podcast 
and he's talking about the fact that 

2384
01:41:28,271 --> 01:41:29,770
sometimes people,
if they,

2385
01:41:29,771 --> 01:41:34,771
if they accept those new ideas,
all of a sudden what they've done with 

2386
01:41:34,771 --> 01:41:35,320
their life for the past 20 years gets 
thrown out the window.

2387
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:40,350
Yeah,
and that's got to be really hard and 

2388
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:40,350
immediately when I was listening to 
that,

2389
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:40,350
I was thinking to myself,
yeah,

2390
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:45,061
that's.
That's what happened in the nineties 

2391
01:41:45,061 --> 01:41:45,070
when somebody that had been studying 
some traditional martial art,

2392
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:47,440
god bless them.
They were doing the best they could,

2393
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:52,830
but when all of a sudden something blue 
belt in jujitsu could come in there and 

2394
01:41:52,830 --> 01:41:52,870
roll them up and choke them out and 
there was nothing they could do about it

2395
01:41:53,110 --> 01:41:55,030
and they either had to do one of two 
things,

2396
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:56,710
say,
okay,

2397
01:41:57,250 --> 01:42:02,250
I'm going to start training this other 
new thing that I don't understand or 

2398
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:02,850
block it out.
WhIch was very hard to do with jujitsu.

2399
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:06,460
I mean that's the good thing about mma 
and about ufc is it was like,

2400
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:08,470
oh,
you can deny it all you want,

2401
01:42:08,471 --> 01:42:09,940
but you have to face this guy on the 
mat.

2402
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:12,070
That's the only way you can.
And when you do that,

2403
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:17,100
you're goIng to lose.
whereas with all these kind of 

2404
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,460
intellectual arguments,
a lot of times it's just I say you say,

2405
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,800
I say you say,
and if you tell me,

2406
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,680
if I'm telling you that every picture of
the earth is whatever,

2407
01:42:23,681 --> 01:42:28,681
cgi,
and that's what I'm going to hold and 

2408
01:42:28,681 --> 01:42:31,201
I'm not going to let it go and how you 
going to prove to me otherwise in every 

2409
01:42:31,201 --> 01:42:31,201
single picture you showed me,
I say no,

2410
01:42:31,201 --> 01:42:32,080
that cgi and you show me another 
picture.

2411
01:42:32,081 --> 01:42:34,300
And I say to her that cgi,
we're never going to get anywhere.

2412
01:42:34,570 --> 01:42:39,400
I'm not arguing with you about it.
You're never going to tap just to turtle

2413
01:42:39,401 --> 01:42:44,401
up in a ball.
I had to go through three of those men 

2414
01:42:44,401 --> 01:42:45,040
because I started out with taekwondo,
which was.

2415
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:50,190
It's not like the,
it's not a good martial art for 

2416
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:50,190
fighting.

2417
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:51,040
It's got a by itself.
It's got too many holes in it,

2418
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:53,530
but it's a great martial art for 
throwing kicks.

2419
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:59,040
And when I went from that to kickboxing,
I realized how easy it was to get 

2420
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,160
punched in the face.
And I was like,

2421
01:43:00,161 --> 01:43:05,161
wow.
And so then I started really studying 

2422
01:43:05,161 --> 01:43:05,161
boxing and I was like,
man,

2423
01:43:05,161 --> 01:43:05,820
my,
my ideas of like,

2424
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:08,440
how well I can fight or so 
overestimated.

2425
01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:13,090
I'm not nearly as good at taekwondo,
I'm not good at fighting.

2426
01:43:13,150 --> 01:43:15,250
And then I started doing more tie and 
I'm like,

2427
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:16,870
oh well,
fucking leg kicks,

2428
01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:20,290
Jesus christ,
leg kicks and knees to the body.

2429
01:43:20,291 --> 01:43:21,310
And the.
I was like,

2430
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:23,170
oh fuck,
there's so much I can.

2431
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:27,680
I'm so fucked now Because I got,
I got really good at something that kind

2432
01:43:27,681 --> 01:43:32,681
of sucks on its own.
And then from there jujitsu where I was 

2433
01:43:32,681 --> 01:43:33,970
just getting raped,
I was like,

2434
01:43:33,971 --> 01:43:36,910
at least with kickboxing,
I could throw kicks,

2435
01:43:36,911 --> 01:43:40,380
I could move around,
I could try not to get my legs kicked,

2436
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:45,390
I could try to like be more mobile.
But when I was going into Jujitsu as a 

2437
01:43:45,390 --> 01:43:49,801
white belt,
I was just getting fucking mall to what 

2438
01:43:49,801 --> 01:43:49,801
happens.
And I had accepted.

2439
01:43:49,801 --> 01:43:51,770
And then so I literally stopped doing 
everything else and they said,

2440
01:43:51,771 --> 01:43:52,010
oh,

2441
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:54,020
I've got to get Better at this in a way 
I can.

2442
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:57,940
You can't even start like,
oh white.

2443
01:43:57,941 --> 01:44:02,941
But some of us never train jujitsu 
before is it has a zero percent chance 

2444
01:44:02,941 --> 01:44:04,950
of beating a guy that's a black belt.
He has zero,

2445
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:06,790
zero percent chance that they're not 
goIng to go down.

2446
01:44:07,210 --> 01:44:11,190
If you take somebody that doesn't really
know how to fight against a boxer there,

2447
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:16,200
there is a puncher's chance.
I mean there's a punch or she's not 

2448
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:16,930
probably not going to happen,
but it's a crazy chance.

2449
01:44:16,931 --> 01:44:21,931
But it could end.
At least the the person that hasn't 

2450
01:44:21,931 --> 01:44:25,651
boxed before has some semblance of an 
idea of what to do.

2451
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:29,440
Block the punches from hitting me and 
try and punch the other guy.

2452
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:30,970
Right.
When you don't know Jujitsu,

2453
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:33,040
you don't even understand what's 
happening.

2454
01:44:33,110 --> 01:44:34,300
You're completely lost.

2455
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:39,340
Yeah.
And there's certain positions like if 

2456
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:40,841
you get your Back taking or something 
like that where you're almost 100 

2457
01:44:40,841 --> 01:44:40,841
percent dead.
Yeah,

2458
01:44:40,841 --> 01:44:45,301
it's.
But I think that there's parallels to 

2459
01:44:45,301 --> 01:44:47,381
that in life because if you look at life
and you look at the way you're behaving 

2460
01:44:47,381 --> 01:44:50,921
and the way you're thinking and the way 
you choose to accept Ideas and the way 

2461
01:44:50,921 --> 01:44:54,800
that you choose to view the world,
if you're so rigid in your ideology that

2462
01:44:54,801 --> 01:44:59,801
you're unwilling to accept any sort of 
new information and new data or any sort

2463
01:45:00,831 --> 01:45:05,780
of contrary data or information like 
someone who's telling you something that

2464
01:45:05,781 --> 01:45:07,180
you don't agree with,
but you,

2465
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:07,820
you're going,
okay,

2466
01:45:07,821 --> 01:45:08,630
well,
all right,

2467
01:45:08,631 --> 01:45:13,631
well what's your perspective?
Instead of Just agreeing or disagreeing 

2468
01:45:13,631 --> 01:45:13,850
with them and arguing and going to war 
with them,

2469
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:15,410
try to take it in.
Try to go,

2470
01:45:15,411 --> 01:45:20,411
okay,
well what is this guy saying that has 

2471
01:45:20,411 --> 01:45:20,411
merit?

2472
01:45:20,411 --> 01:45:20,411
Where's this guy coming from?
Or if I.

2473
01:45:20,411 --> 01:45:21,140
Even if I totally disagree with them,
what?

2474
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,940
What makes him think this?
Like where?

2475
01:45:22,941 --> 01:45:27,941
What's going on in your head that you 
think that we should take everyone's 

2476
01:45:27,941 --> 01:45:29,570
money and distriButed equally across the
country.

2477
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:32,840
Like there's people that believe that,
that everyone who's ever been successful

2478
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:37,930
somehow or another got through stealing 
and then what we need to do is take all 

2479
01:45:37,930 --> 01:45:38,240
the money in the country and 
redistribute all this.

2480
01:45:38,241 --> 01:45:41,390
Well so everybody gets $50,000.
okay,

2481
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:43,910
well why do you think this?
Cool?

2482
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:44,770
Yeah,
I want to know.

2483
01:45:44,771 --> 01:45:49,771
You know I'm not.
I might argue with it or I might see 

2484
01:45:49,771 --> 01:45:51,290
your point or I might think that if you 
did do this,

2485
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:53,030
but you still,
if you did this right now,

2486
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:54,950
this is what I think if you did this 
right now,

2487
01:45:55,070 --> 01:46:00,070
if you took all the money from all the 
billionaires and all these fucking rich 

2488
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:01,100
tycoons,
all of them and took all theIr money and

2489
01:46:01,101 --> 01:46:04,220
distributed it equally amongst everybody
in the country,

2490
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:09,370
how long would it take if you just 
allowed normal capitalism to flourish 

2491
01:46:09,370 --> 01:46:10,940
after that,
how long would it take before the levels

2492
01:46:10,941 --> 01:46:12,230
went right back to where they are?

2493
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:14,260
Would it be 10 years?
Would it be 20?

2494
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:14,900
How long would it take

2495
01:46:15,010 --> 01:46:20,010
belong?
The way I explained that concept to my 

2496
01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:20,090
children was I said,
okay,

2497
01:46:20,091 --> 01:46:22,280
here's,
here's what communism is,

2498
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:23,630
because this is what you're talking 
about.

2499
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:24,560
I said,
let's.

2500
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:27,560
My kids are really hard workers and they
do well in school,

2501
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,760
and I said,
you know,

2502
01:46:28,761 --> 01:46:30,740
you study hard for your test,
right?

2503
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:36,010
Let's say you get a nInety,
95 on your test and then what happens 

2504
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:39,230
with communism is there's another kid in
your class who's the dumbest kid,

2505
01:46:39,231 --> 01:46:40,150
billy,
okay,

2506
01:46:40,151 --> 01:46:41,510
billy's getting up,
whatever,

2507
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:46,560
a third now.
So what we're gonna do is you're going 

2508
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,101
to take the test and then we're going to
take whatever points from you and given 

2509
01:46:49,101 --> 01:46:49,980
to Billy so that you both get a d and 
that's

2510
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,320
what we're going to do now.
That's what communism missing.

2511
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:57,380
Now if I do that,
is that can insPire you to work any 

2512
01:46:57,380 --> 01:46:58,470
harder.
the answer's obviously no,

2513
01:46:58,590 --> 01:47:00,780
you're not going to.
You're going to get a d no matter what.

2514
01:47:01,010 --> 01:47:02,880
Is it going to inspire billy to work any
harder?

2515
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:04,860
The answer is no.
It is not,

2516
01:47:04,861 --> 01:47:09,861
but he's not going to work any harder.
So what we have is no one working and 

2517
01:47:09,861 --> 01:47:09,960
that's what happens in communism.
You're,

2518
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:15,020
you're all just level set.
You're all gonna get the same thing and 

2519
01:47:15,020 --> 01:47:15,020
that's why it's failed everywhere.
It's tried.

2520
01:47:15,020 --> 01:47:18,330
Yeah.
It's not the right idea for just the way

2521
01:47:18,331 --> 01:47:21,810
the human reward system works.
It's not the right idea for motivation.

2522
01:47:21,811 --> 01:47:26,811
It's not a ride,
right idea for like the only way things 

2523
01:47:26,811 --> 01:47:27,860
get done and the only way you get a 
laptop or a Big skyscraper,

2524
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:29,130
someone has to profit from it.

2525
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:31,350
They have to get something out of it.
And by the way,

2526
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:36,410
someone has to make that haPpen.
Someone has to be driven to want that 

2527
01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:40,281
laptop and to want that skyscraper.
Somebody got a want to make that and 

2528
01:47:40,281 --> 01:47:41,250
you're right for them to want it.
There's got to be some reward.

2529
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:46,550
There's got to be some of being driven 
is you gotta have something to show for 

2530
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:50,271
it.
So we gotta be really careful that the 

2531
01:47:50,271 --> 01:47:52,110
amount of wealth that you spread around,
if you spread it all around,

2532
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:54,720
you're going to end up with no one 
wanting to achieve anything.

2533
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:59,900
Yeah.
Like I hear bernie sanders talk and he 

2534
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:01,020
seems like a really nice guy and he 
seems like he really has his mind in the

2535
01:48:01,021 --> 01:48:02,730
right place in his heart,
in the right place,

2536
01:48:02,731 --> 01:48:05,940
and this idea of democratic socialism.
See him talking to people.

2537
01:48:05,941 --> 01:48:06,300
I'm like,
well,

2538
01:48:06,301 --> 01:48:08,100
that's definitely better than being 
greedy.

2539
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:11,010
It's definitely better than being 
corrupted by the banks.

2540
01:48:11,011 --> 01:48:14,160
It's definitely better than being 
corrupted by wall street and given these

2541
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:19,161
bullshit phony speeches for hundreds of 
thousand dollars in fucking over people 

2542
01:48:19,161 --> 01:48:21,120
for profit,
but does that shit.

2543
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:24,150
But does socialism really work?
It doesn't seem to work.

2544
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:29,180
It doesn't seem to like work in terms of
humAn motivation doesn't even work for 

2545
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:32,700
bernIe sanders who has multiple homes.
I mean the guy's got multiple ones.

2546
01:48:32,701 --> 01:48:37,701
You just bought our house for $800,000.
And what does he open that up to?

2547
01:48:38,041 --> 01:48:39,870
The public to come and stay in his house
because.

2548
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:40,920
No,
of course not.

2549
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:42,810
So it it.
It's sold out.

2550
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:46,350
It's different.
Different thing at garden.

2551
01:48:46,351 --> 01:48:48,420
This money surfing the people.
Yeah,

2552
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:49,650
exactly.
Exactly right.

2553
01:48:49,651 --> 01:48:54,651
You did it and that money and if you 
want to go out and buy that second home 

2554
01:48:54,651 --> 01:48:54,651
on a lake,
good,

2555
01:48:54,651 --> 01:48:55,290
good for you,
bernie,

2556
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:59,820
but don't try and you know,
make it like that's like,

2557
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,210
like that's okay to take everyone else's
money.

2558
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:06,450
They will do to everybody else,
but not to me it doesn't work.

2559
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:11,480
Well.
The concept of income inequality is 

2560
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:11,480
always strange because it's like,
well,

2561
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:11,680
okay,
but you should,

2562
01:49:11,681 --> 01:49:15,720
you make the same amount of money for a 
job that doesn't have the same amount of

2563
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:17,130
importance.
If again,

2564
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:20,070
let's just go aHead and straight up 
answer for you know.

2565
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:21,580
No,
you shouldn't.

2566
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:24,870
If you got paid after 10 years of 
medical school,

2567
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:30,110
the same that you get paid to drive a 
bus after you busted your ass and worked

2568
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:32,910
hard and had to study and do all this 
stuff to go to medical school and by the

2569
01:49:32,911 --> 01:49:37,911
way,
you built up a bunch of debt trying to 

2570
01:49:37,911 --> 01:49:39,621
go to school.
Why don't you just become a bus driver 

2571
01:49:39,621 --> 01:49:40,610
for innovation?
Can be financial relationship.

2572
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:41,840
We hope when we.

2573
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:46,860
You got to be.
We have to be careful that,

2574
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:51,550
and of course there are people that 
legitimately need help in the west.

2575
01:49:51,551 --> 01:49:56,551
There's people with with disabilities,
there's people with mental problems and 

2576
01:49:56,551 --> 01:50:01,081
we've got to be compassionate and take 
care of those people to the best of our 

2577
01:50:01,081 --> 01:50:02,290
ability,
but we definitely watch out for,

2578
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:07,380
hey,
let's steal everything from the people 

2579
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:07,380
that worked hard and give it to the 
people that didn't.

2580
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:08,200
Yeah,
it just doesn't seem like a good idea.

2581
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:12,790
It seems contrary to what we know about 
human motivation.

2582
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:14,350
Basic human instincts.
Yeah,

2583
01:50:14,351 --> 01:50:19,351
and then where do you stop?
Where do you stop legitimately like 

2584
01:50:19,351 --> 01:50:22,330
worldwide,
because we could distribute all them 

2585
01:50:22,330 --> 01:50:24,990
money and wealth that we've built in 
american distributed over the whole 

2586
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:24,990
world.
Well,

2587
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:28,660
I think a better concept is figuring out
why there are pockets of extreme poverty

2588
01:50:28,661 --> 01:50:33,661
and how to mitigate those pockets of 
poverty that have just been generation 

2589
01:50:33,661 --> 01:50:34,300
after generation in certain 
neighborhoods.

2590
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:37,570
It just been extreme poverty and these 
people that grow up there,

2591
01:50:37,571 --> 01:50:42,571
that's what they know.
They're sort of almost programmed Into 

2592
01:50:42,571 --> 01:50:42,571
it because they're.
They're seeing it around them.

2593
01:50:42,571 --> 01:50:47,011
That is the paradigm that they,
they accept and it's very self limiting 

2594
01:50:47,651 --> 01:50:52,651
in a lot of ways.
We don't see anybody escape where you 

2595
01:50:52,651 --> 01:50:52,651
see very few people escape.
It's very.

2596
01:50:52,651 --> 01:50:53,740
You feel like,
you know,

2597
01:50:53,741 --> 01:50:55,780
resistance is futile.
Like what do you do?

2598
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:56,730
You know there's a,
there's a.

2599
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,680
I wish I knew the,
all the details of this,

2600
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:03,850
but there was a native american tribe 
and somebody I'm sure we'll will tell me

2601
01:51:03,851 --> 01:51:06,250
what it is,
but there was a native american tribe in

2602
01:51:06,251 --> 01:51:11,251
northern California that when all the 
native american tribes got designated as

2603
01:51:11,831 --> 01:51:13,300
native american tribes and they got,
you know,

2604
01:51:13,301 --> 01:51:16,450
here's what you're going to get and this
is your tribe and this is these guys.

2605
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,830
FoR whatever reason,
they didn't get it.

2606
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:21,070
They didn't get designated as a native 
american tribe.

2607
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,830
They just got,
they got passed over.

2608
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:28,890
No one noticed them and now all the 
members of that tribe like completely 

2609
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:29,170
dominate dave,
ron,

2610
01:51:29,171 --> 01:51:30,070
everything.
Financially,

2611
01:51:30,071 --> 01:51:31,420
they own everything up there.
They,

2612
01:51:31,470 --> 01:51:32,650
they kind of kicked ass.
Right?

2613
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:38,460
And it's Because they had to.
And I think a lot of times when when 

2614
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:40,300
people just get given stuff,
it becomes a very,

2615
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:42,310
very difficult for them to say,
you know what,

2616
01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:44,800
I'm going to go out and work hard,
you know,

2617
01:51:45,010 --> 01:51:46,000
am I going to bus?
Yeah.

2618
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:51,020
That's a classic example of hey,
am I going to bust my ass at mcdonald's 

2619
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:51,940
for eight bucks an hour,
40 hours a week or whatever,

2620
01:51:51,941 --> 01:51:53,590
thIrty hours a week for nine bucks an 
hour,

2621
01:51:53,591 --> 01:51:58,591
I'm going to work that hard doing that.
Or am I just going to take my welfare 

2622
01:51:58,591 --> 01:51:58,591
check?

2623
01:51:58,591 --> 01:52:01,120
Which is equal to or almost equal to for
sitting around doing nothing.

2624
01:52:01,730 --> 01:52:04,210
But that's not a hard questIon to answer
for many,

2625
01:52:04,211 --> 01:52:04,960
many people.
Yeah.

2626
01:52:04,970 --> 01:52:09,130
I'm going to sit around and do nothing.
So we had to be careful that it's hard.

2627
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:10,390
Yeah,
it is hard.

2628
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:15,430
It's,
it is a natural inclination that people 

2629
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:16,180
have to do the least amount to,
to just be as comfortable as possible or

2630
01:52:16,181 --> 01:52:18,070
as lazy as possible.
You know,

2631
01:52:18,071 --> 01:52:23,071
I think your,
your statement that you always say 

2632
01:52:23,071 --> 01:52:24,910
dicicco discipline equals freedom.
People should have that shit tattooed on

2633
01:52:24,911 --> 01:52:26,170
their thigh.
You know,

2634
01:52:26,171 --> 01:52:27,850
you should look at that when you get up 
in the morning,

2635
01:52:27,851 --> 01:52:32,410
you put your underwear on like it's.
That shit is so important because if you

2636
01:52:32,411 --> 01:52:37,411
do have discipline and if you do go out 
there and get the things done that you 

2637
01:52:37,411 --> 01:52:40,390
need to get done,
you have freedom and you feel better and

2638
01:52:40,391 --> 01:52:45,391
you feel relaxed because you're not.
You don't have that balloon hoverIng 

2639
01:52:45,391 --> 01:52:46,250
over you,
that balloon

2640
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:51,250
of you know,
just knowing that you're not doing your 

2641
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:55,241
best knowing that you're not out there 
hustling and if you just get a free 

2642
01:52:55,241 --> 01:52:58,100
check every month and they don't really 
have to go out there and kick ass,

2643
01:52:58,101 --> 01:53:00,470
you can kind of get by.
Boy that doesn't.

2644
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:03,380
It's not.
It's not conducive to lighting that fire

2645
01:53:03,381 --> 01:53:05,030
under your ass that you need to be 
successful.

2646
01:53:05,510 --> 01:53:10,510
And again,
I'm going to point this out for I think 

2647
01:53:10,510 --> 01:53:10,520
the second or third time today.
I'm no sociologist,

2648
01:53:10,521 --> 01:53:15,521
I don't,
I'm not some big guy that understands 

2649
01:53:15,521 --> 01:53:15,830
the mechanisms of the welfare state and 
all that.

2650
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:18,230
I'm just going off of what?
When I think,

2651
01:53:18,290 --> 01:53:19,790
which is similar to what you're saying.
Look,

2652
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:22,430
if I was just getting a check for not 
doing anything,

2653
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:24,030
I wouldn't feel good aBout it.
Yeah,

2654
01:53:24,470 --> 01:53:29,470
I wouldn't feel good about it.
And so I think that there are people 

2655
01:53:29,470 --> 01:53:30,050
that go,
hey,

2656
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:32,270
if I can get free money,
I'm going to take the free money.

2657
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:37,330
You know,
there is a concept of universal basic 

2658
01:53:37,330 --> 01:53:39,401
income.
That's kind of interesting though 

2659
01:53:39,401 --> 01:53:41,270
because this idea is that once we get 
automation and once we get an artificial

2660
01:53:41,271 --> 01:53:45,650
intelligence that there's going to be so
many Jobs that don't exist anymore,

2661
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:50,090
that we've got to figure out what to do 
with all these people and the idea is if

2662
01:53:50,091 --> 01:53:52,130
you just have your basic needs taken 
care of,

2663
01:53:52,150 --> 01:53:55,250
like not enough so that you could 
actually thrive,

2664
01:53:55,580 --> 01:54:00,580
But just we have food and shelter.
How many people would then pursue their 

2665
01:54:00,580 --> 01:54:05,111
actual love and what they're actually 
passionate about and would it be the 

2666
01:54:05,111 --> 01:54:05,111
city.
There's,

2667
01:54:05,111 --> 01:54:07,010
there's tests they're doing,
they're doing on it now.

2668
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:10,490
They're trying to find out would the 
same amount of people be successful,

2669
01:54:10,491 --> 01:54:15,491
would more be successful or would less 
like how many people would pursue their 

2670
01:54:15,491 --> 01:54:17,000
dream if they knew they didn't have to 
worry about starving to death,

2671
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:18,940
they just got money every month they 
got,

2672
01:54:18,990 --> 01:54:23,990
they knew where they were going to sleep
and eat and then they could just go and 

2673
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:23,990
do whatever the fuck they want to do.

2674
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:27,580
Or would that just squash motivation?
Uh,

2675
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:29,020
I don't know.
I don't know what the answer is.

2676
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:30,610
I'd say what I think.
I think.

2677
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:32,530
I think it's squashed as motivation for 
some.

2678
01:54:33,180 --> 01:54:38,180
Would it for you if you got a check 
every month for like 12 grand or 12 

2679
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:38,900
grand for the year,
whatever it is.

2680
01:54:38,901 --> 01:54:41,600
Like I think that's the idea.
So you give people like a thousand bucks

2681
01:54:41,601 --> 01:54:44,000
a year or a thousand bucks a month.
Thousand bucks a month.

2682
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:45,440
Yeah,
maybe double that.

2683
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:48,350
Just enough that you could just get by.
But you know,

2684
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:50,030
you're not boiling.
Two questions.

2685
01:54:50,150 --> 01:54:55,150
Number one,
of course would add what I take free 

2686
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:55,150
money.
sure.

2687
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:55,150
Would I feel good about it?
No.

2688
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:55,640
Number two,
where does that money come from?

2689
01:54:55,870 --> 01:54:56,840
Right?
Where does it come from?

2690
01:54:56,860 --> 01:54:59,900
Because that's the thing that I also 
explained to my kids is that,

2691
01:54:59,901 --> 01:55:00,980
you know,
every time you,

2692
01:55:01,190 --> 01:55:04,310
every time the government gives a dollar
to somebody,

2693
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,800
they took that dollar from somebody 
else.

2694
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:07,880
Yeah.
So,

2695
01:55:08,330 --> 01:55:09,380
and It's,
you know,

2696
01:55:09,381 --> 01:55:10,850
it's,
that's the reality of it.

2697
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:15,950
Yeah.
Then the question is like where like 

2698
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:17,810
when a guy like bernie madoff or some 
crazy wall street character,

2699
01:55:18,170 --> 01:55:20,390
when they just moved some money around 
and make money,

2700
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:21,670
lIke,
okay,

2701
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:24,500
how much you get out of that?
Like where's that coming from?

2702
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:26,720
Whose,
whose money was that?

2703
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:27,650
Like,
where's that guy?

2704
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:29,210
Where's that going?
And it has it.

2705
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:30,620
How does it exist?
Well,

2706
01:55:30,621 --> 01:55:32,180
bernie's a bad example,
right?

2707
01:55:32,181 --> 01:55:34,430
Because he was stealing everyone's for 
the best example.

2708
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:34,980
Who,
well,

2709
01:55:34,990 --> 01:55:36,380
okay,
I'll give you that.

2710
01:55:36,790 --> 01:55:39,290
That uh,
but again,

2711
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:44,280
those people are formulating companies 
and funding companies

2712
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:46,830
that are trying to grow and build and 
create things.

2713
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:48,270
You know,
that that money,

2714
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:50,710
it moved somewhere and it ends up,
you know,

2715
01:55:50,730 --> 01:55:52,260
investing in a company and building a 
company.

2716
01:55:52,261 --> 01:55:53,130
That's what,
that's what,

2717
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:54,780
that's what America is,
right?

2718
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:56,370
Yeah,
trying to build things,

2719
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,350
trying to make things.
Yeah,

2720
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:03,410
taking risk.
I wonder what is going to happen though 

2721
01:56:03,410 --> 01:56:03,780
when all these fucking robots.
One is the uh,

2722
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:07,620
the automatic driving cars,
trucks because that's a huge,

2723
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:08,940
you know,
you go to vegas,

2724
01:56:09,210 --> 01:56:14,210
I was thinking about this when I'm in 
vegas and you go to the buffet and 

2725
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:15,120
there's like 10 billion pounds of food.
None of that food comes from vegas.

2726
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:18,780
All gets trucked in there.
So at some point all those trucks can be

2727
01:56:18,781 --> 01:56:21,330
driven by robots and that's not too far 
in the future at all.

2728
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:26,360
I think they're already doing it in 
Australia already have automated trucks 

2729
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:26,830
in Australia that are driving,
you know,

2730
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:28,050
shipping things around.

2731
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:33,800
It's going to get weird.
Get real weird between that and genetic 

2732
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:36,380
engineering and all these different 
things that we've been talking about.

2733
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:39,120
This kid could get really weird.
And I think again,

2734
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:41,730
going back to the original conversation 
we started off with today,

2735
01:56:41,910 --> 01:56:46,910
I think the weirder it gets in the 
further we get away from primal sort of 

2736
01:56:46,910 --> 01:56:49,260
existence of hunting down food and 
fighting against other tribes.

2737
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,120
I think the further we get away from 
that,

2738
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:53,820
the more we're going to have to reach 
back to it and ground ourselves to it.

2739
01:56:54,330 --> 01:56:55,380
Well,
at the very least,

2740
01:56:55,381 --> 01:56:58,770
the more you're going to have to deal 
with whatever requirements your body and

2741
01:56:58,771 --> 01:57:03,771
your mind have for difficulty.
I think we have requirements for 

2742
01:57:03,771 --> 01:57:05,980
struggle and difficulty because I think 
your body is set up to it.

2743
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:11,690
I think Jay,
biologically we have certain 

2744
01:57:11,690 --> 01:57:14,121
expectations for difficulty and when you
don't uncover those oryx encounter those

2745
01:57:14,701 --> 01:57:15,510
expectations.

2746
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:20,690
I think people find like a real lack of 
meaning and in this lack of stress and 

2747
01:57:20,690 --> 01:57:25,611
this piece and that's why we're going to
have to reach Back to this physicality 

2748
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:27,170
at some point.
And it's a good.

2749
01:57:27,171 --> 01:57:28,620
It's not just physicality or like you're
saying,

2750
01:57:28,621 --> 01:57:31,410
it's a mental struggle too.
It's trying to achieve things.

2751
01:57:31,411 --> 01:57:33,780
It's trying to.
When it's trying to be competitive,

2752
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:36,600
if I'm just sitting there and I don't 
have a job anymore and I just get,

2753
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:37,750
you know,
12,000

2754
01:57:37,770 --> 01:57:42,770
bucks a month and that's enough for me 
to pay my food and pay my rent and I'm 

2755
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:42,770
just going to sit there and play video 
games.

2756
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:46,410
I don't think that's the kind of 
existence I would want to live in.

2757
01:57:46,411 --> 01:57:51,411
Might not even just be physical too.
I think it's just in overcoming and 

2758
01:57:51,411 --> 01:57:52,650
enduring and figuring things out.
Like even writing a book,

2759
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:54,580
I'm sure you're feeling like you just.

2760
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:59,660
You have a new book out the way of the 
warrior kid and I'm sure the feeling 

2761
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:02,901
that you get when you write a book and 
completion completed is I fucking did 

2762
01:58:02,901 --> 01:58:03,330
it.
I made that happen.

2763
01:58:03,331 --> 01:58:05,100
I didn't want to get through all those 
days.

2764
01:58:05,101 --> 01:58:06,570
There was a lot of times I didn't want 
to write,

2765
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:11,750
but I got through it and here it is.
There's a satisfaction of accomplishing 

2766
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:15,981
goals and overcoming obstacles and 
problems and if they don't have to be 

2767
01:58:15,981 --> 01:58:17,820
physical,
I think there's mental requirements that

2768
01:58:17,821 --> 01:58:18,870
we have as well.
Yeah.

2769
01:58:18,871 --> 01:58:20,670
I think when people aren't mentally 
challenged,

2770
01:58:20,671 --> 01:58:25,671
they just start to fade and if you're 
not looking for the physical and the 

2771
01:58:25,671 --> 01:58:27,420
mental challenges,
you're going to start to fade.

2772
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:30,000
So you goTta be careful that why'd you 
write this book?

2773
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:35,540
Well,
if it's a kid's book way of the warrior 

2774
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:38,870
kid,
and the reason I wrote it is because 

2775
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:41,360
first of all,
all the things that we're talking about 

2776
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:42,280
right now,
they're happening even to kids.

2777
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:43,570
I mean you have kids,
right?

2778
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:45,340
Ipads,
iphones,

2779
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:50,400
they're sucked into technology and 
there's nothing completely wrong with 

2780
01:58:50,501 --> 01:58:55,501
that.
but if they get sucked into technology 

2781
01:58:55,501 --> 01:58:55,501
and they don't ever come out of it,
you got issues.

2782
01:58:55,501 --> 01:58:57,670
And being a kid,
if you remember,

2783
01:58:57,780 --> 01:59:00,220
and a lot of people forget this.
Being a kid is hard.

2784
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:04,660
Being a kid is hard and in this 
particular book there's a kid,

2785
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:07,570
his name is mark,
he's in fifth grade.

2786
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:11,560
he's got kind of the typical issues that
a fifth grader has.

2787
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:16,800
He can't do any pull ups.
So in gym class when they're doing pull 

2788
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:20,401
ups,
he's getting made fun of he's doesn't 

2789
01:59:20,401 --> 01:59:23,401
know is timestables,
which you should absolutely know in 

2790
01:59:23,401 --> 01:59:23,401
fifth grade.
But he doesn't know him,

2791
01:59:23,401 --> 01:59:26,821
so he's thinks he's stupid now he 
doesn't know how to swim because he 

2792
01:59:26,821 --> 01:59:30,100
never learned and he's when they go on 
the field trip to the,

2793
01:59:30,150 --> 01:59:31,810
to the lake,
he doesn't know how to swim.

2794
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:33,400
So everyone's having a good tIme and he 
can't.

2795
01:59:33,401 --> 01:59:38,401
And eventually they call them out on it 
and finally is getting picked on by the 

2796
01:59:38,401 --> 01:59:38,500
big bully.
Kenny williamson,

2797
01:59:39,050 --> 01:59:40,150
fucking kenny.
Kenny,

2798
01:59:41,260 --> 01:59:44,160
kenny williamson.
So it lasted.

2799
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:46,780
The book starts off last day of school.
Basically.

2800
01:59:46,781 --> 01:59:49,480
All these problems come to a head.
He's all bummed out,

2801
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:52,990
cryIng behind the library,
goes home and when he gets home,

2802
01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:58,230
his mom reminds him that his uncle,
uncle jake is coming to stay with him 

2803
01:59:58,230 --> 02:00:02,340
for the summer.
And uncle jake is a guy that was a seal 

2804
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:07,260
in the seal teams and he's just got out 
of the seal teams and he's going to go 

2805
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:10,711
to college in the fall,
but he's going to spend the summer with 

2806
02:00:10,711 --> 02:00:13,220
his sister and his nephew mark.
And so you know,

2807
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:15,760
the,
the navy seal shows up.

2808
02:00:15,761 --> 02:00:18,660
Uncle jake shows up and he sees his 
little nephew and he says,

2809
02:00:18,670 --> 02:00:19,120
hey,
you know,

2810
02:00:19,190 --> 02:00:21,350
either actually staying in the same room
and he says,

2811
02:00:21,351 --> 02:00:22,240
hey,
you know what going to do tomorrow.

2812
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:25,000
You want to go play some ball with you 
want to go for a swim?

2813
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:26,740
And the kid says,
you know,

2814
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:29,320
I don't want to play ball.
It's not fun and,

2815
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:31,630
and I don't know how to swim and don't 
really breaks down,

2816
02:00:31,690 --> 02:00:33,700
you know,
getting picked on the whole nine yards.

2817
02:00:33,701 --> 02:00:35,680
And his uncle says,
okay,

2818
02:00:35,681 --> 02:00:37,420
so you can't swim.
You don't know your times tables,

2819
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,460
you can't do any pull ups and you're 
getting picked on.

2820
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,330
We can change all those things.
We Just have to get a plan,

2821
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:46,660
put it together and make it happen.
So it puts them on the workout program,

2822
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:49,270
teaches them how to study,
teaches them how to swim,

2823
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:54,560
teaches them jujitsu.
If it was only that easy and what's 

2824
02:00:56,040 --> 02:01:00,550
what's good is it's not as hard as 
people think.

2825
02:01:00,551 --> 02:01:05,551
And I think that's why the Book's 
getting strong reaction because there's 

2826
02:01:05,551 --> 02:01:07,000
actually pragmatic methods in there on,
for instance,

2827
02:01:07,001 --> 02:01:07,990
I went through all this stuff.

2828
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:09,760
Not knowing,
not knowing timetables.

2829
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:12,510
I went through that with my daughter.
My oldest daughter didn't know her times

2830
02:01:12,511 --> 02:01:14,980
tables and what she thought was,
she's stupid.

2831
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,350
She thought I'm stupid.
I don't know my times tables.

2832
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,460
Other kids know him.
I don't know him.

2833
02:01:18,670 --> 02:01:19,630
And I said to her,
you know,

2834
02:01:19,631 --> 02:01:20,990
she's crying,
you know,

2835
02:01:20,991 --> 02:01:22,870
this isn't whatever,
third or fourth grade crying,

2836
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,460
what's wrong?
I'm stupid.

2837
02:01:24,580 --> 02:01:26,440
Why do you think you're stupid?
I don't know my times tables.

2838
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:30,500
How much have you studied them?
I haven't studied them.

2839
02:01:30,980 --> 02:01:35,980
Well,
how do you think you're going to know 

2840
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:35,980
him if you haven't studied them?
What do you mean studying?

2841
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:35,980
Boom.
Make flashcards.

2842
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:37,670
An hour later she knows her times 
tables.

2843
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:41,330
It's that and so I actually go through 
that method in the book.

2844
02:01:42,110 --> 02:01:43,670
How do you learn how to fight?
You're getting picked on.

2845
02:01:43,671 --> 02:01:44,390
How do you learn how to fight?

2846
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:49,540
You go down to your,
your Jujitsu school and you started 

2847
02:01:49,540 --> 02:01:49,580
learning to jitsu and you and I both 
know,

2848
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:52,460
if you know jujitsu in a great school 
fight in sixth grade,

2849
02:01:52,670 --> 02:01:55,340
you're goIng to win a 100 percent of the
time.

2850
02:01:55,610 --> 02:01:56,750
Right?
So you learn,

2851
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:58,970
do you learn that?
Learn how to swim,

2852
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,020
how do you,
how do you do that in?

2853
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:01,820
His big thing is he's afraid of water.
Well,

2854
02:02:01,821 --> 02:02:03,980
why are you afraid of the water?
How do you overcome that fear?

2855
02:02:03,981 --> 02:02:06,440
How do you overcome fear?
You got to inoculate yourself to it.

2856
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:09,200
You start off wading in the water,
then you don't your head.

2857
02:02:09,201 --> 02:02:10,190
Then you get,
you know,

2858
02:02:10,191 --> 02:02:12,530
then you eat.
Then you lay down and you feel the water

2859
02:02:12,531 --> 02:02:17,531
all over your body and then eventually 
you step in and then eventually you 

2860
02:02:17,531 --> 02:02:19,991
start to dog paddle and then eventually 
you start to swim and then eventually 

2861
02:02:19,991 --> 02:02:19,991
jumped off the bridge.

2862
02:02:19,991 --> 02:02:23,860
so these are real things.
That's how you overcome fear and that 

2863
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:23,860
you know,
that one I got from my,

2864
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:27,200
my middle daughter who wanted to be in 
the school play,

2865
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:32,920
but she got stage fright and so she 
would freak out every time she would 

2866
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:34,550
have to go in front of a crowd.
So I said,

2867
02:02:34,551 --> 02:02:36,800
okay,
we're going to inoculate you to being in

2868
02:02:36,801 --> 02:02:41,801
front of people first.
You're going to sing in front of me and 

2869
02:02:41,801 --> 02:02:42,590
then you're going to sing in front of me
and mom,

2870
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:47,680
and then you're going to sung in front 
of me and mom and your brothers and 

2871
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,901
sisters,
and then you're going to sing in front 

2872
02:02:49,901 --> 02:02:49,901
of you know our friends that are Gonna.
Come over.

2873
02:02:49,901 --> 02:02:53,071
There's going to be 10 of them,
and then you're going to sing in front 

2874
02:02:53,071 --> 02:02:54,731
of you know all of the people that we 
know at a block party and then you're 

2875
02:02:54,731 --> 02:02:54,731
going to get out and you're gonna do 
your rehearsal,

2876
02:02:54,731 --> 02:02:57,080
and she did it and she got a knock 
related and I'll tell you right now,

2877
02:02:57,081 --> 02:03:02,081
she's not afraid of anything that girl,
and so that's the saMe thing that that 

2878
02:03:02,081 --> 02:03:03,350
he goes through in the book,
overcoming his fear of water.

2879
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:05,240
He inoculates too.
It gets used to it,

2880
02:03:05,241 --> 02:03:09,170
and then finally the final step is you 
have to go right that you can't overcome

2881
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:11,380
every part of the unknown.
You have to.

2882
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:13,550
There's always gonna.
Be someone known in doIng something that

2883
02:03:13,551 --> 02:03:18,551
you've never done before and then what 
do you do when you prepared as much as 

2884
02:03:18,551 --> 02:03:21,341
you can?
And you've done all the training that 

2885
02:03:21,341 --> 02:03:23,381
you can do,
then you've got to step up and you got 

2886
02:03:23,381 --> 02:03:23,381
to go.
So that's what the book's about.

2887
02:03:23,381 --> 02:03:27,460
And I wrote it so that kids can apply 
these things that I learned both in the 

2888
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:29,570
seal teams and in raising my own kids 
they can apply into to their life.

2889
02:03:29,571 --> 02:03:34,571
And the reaction's been great.
It's been great to see all these kids 

2890
02:03:34,571 --> 02:03:36,941
reading it and all the great feedback of
kids doing pushups and pull ups and and 

2891
02:03:36,941 --> 02:03:38,860
training and going down and starting 
jujitsu and making flashcards.

2892
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:40,790
It's awesome.
That is awesome.

2893
02:03:40,850 --> 02:03:42,740
And then one of the cool things about 
being a kid is,

2894
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:44,640
well,
it's hard.

2895
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:49,680
It's a struggle in that you haven't 
really achieved any success yet in 

2896
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:52,901
anything,
but what you don't realize is that 

2897
02:03:52,901 --> 02:03:55,510
you've got all these possibilities to 
get good at stuff like once you become 

2898
02:03:55,510 --> 02:03:57,980
really good at something.
One of the real problems is people don't

2899
02:03:57,981 --> 02:04:00,660
like to get out of their comfort zone 
and to become a beginner again though.

2900
02:04:00,970 --> 02:04:05,970
And it's one of the beautiful things 
about life is humbling yourself with 

2901
02:04:05,970 --> 02:04:08,230
something new.
Humbling yourself and learning stuff and

2902
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:10,280
kids,
they don't have that lesson yet,

2903
02:04:10,281 --> 02:04:13,520
so everything is terrifying,
but once they do learn it,

2904
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:15,980
if you could teach a kid how to get good
at one thing,

2905
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:21,220
like one of the things that led me to 
get good at standup comedy and all the 

2906
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:22,970
other things that I did is that I got 
really good at martial arts young.

2907
02:04:23,270 --> 02:04:24,260
So I knew,
okay,

2908
02:04:24,261 --> 02:04:26,660
I sucked when I first started,
I remember sucking,

2909
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:31,810
but I remember I kept working and I get 
good at it because I focused and I put 

2910
02:04:31,810 --> 02:04:35,891
the time in.
Well if I just do that without anything 

2911
02:04:35,891 --> 02:04:36,470
else you've learned that you,
you can make a path,

2912
02:04:36,530 --> 02:04:37,980
you can do it,
it can be done.

2913
02:04:37,981 --> 02:04:38,820
And that's,
that's,

2914
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,410
you know,
that's kind of one of the main points of

2915
02:04:40,411 --> 02:04:45,411
the book.
And when the kid finally does his 10 

2916
02:04:45,411 --> 02:04:45,720
pull ups,
that was his goal and his uncle says,

2917
02:04:45,721 --> 02:04:47,790
you know,
do you understand what this is about?

2918
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:49,050
And tHis kid says,
you know,

2919
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:49,680
well,
it's about,

2920
02:04:49,681 --> 02:04:50,730
I can do pull ups now.
And he says,

2921
02:04:50,731 --> 02:04:55,731
no,
this is about everything about 

2922
02:04:55,731 --> 02:04:55,731
everything that you want to do in life.
You're going to have to work for you,

2923
02:04:55,731 --> 02:04:56,580
you're gonna have to come up with a 
plan,

2924
02:04:56,581 --> 02:04:59,880
you're going to have to have the 
discipline to execute that plan and when

2925
02:04:59,881 --> 02:05:04,881
you do that,
you're going to be able to achieve what 

2926
02:05:04,881 --> 02:05:04,881
you want to achieve.

2927
02:05:04,881 --> 02:05:05,850
And that's hard work.
Hard work and discipline is what's going

2928
02:05:05,851 --> 02:05:10,851
to get you there.
And probably a lot of kids don't have 

2929
02:05:10,851 --> 02:05:10,851
anybody in front of them like jocko to 
tell them.

2930
02:05:10,851 --> 02:05:11,370
Well,
and you know what,

2931
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:13,440
it's interesting.
So in this book,

2932
02:05:13,441 --> 02:05:18,441
you know,
uncle jake is the character and he 

2933
02:05:18,441 --> 02:05:21,111
actually addresses that in the end of 
the book because uncle jake leafs and 

2934
02:05:21,111 --> 02:05:21,111
the kid says,
hey,

2935
02:05:21,111 --> 02:05:22,530
you know,
you're not going to be around anymore.

2936
02:05:22,531 --> 02:05:23,970
Who's gonna?
Who's gonna lead me?

2937
02:05:23,971 --> 02:05:25,620
Who's going to help me train?
And he says,

2938
02:05:25,621 --> 02:05:28,200
you didn't need me then and you don't 
need me.

2939
02:05:28,201 --> 02:05:31,470
Now you know what you need to do.
You know what's going to take hard work.

2940
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:33,090
And the other thing that I did in this 
book,

2941
02:05:33,091 --> 02:05:36,420
which is I,
I played around with the idea,

2942
02:05:36,421 --> 02:05:41,421
but his dad,
the kid's dad is not really present and,

2943
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:47,120
and the reason I did that is because a 
lot of kids these days don't have a data

2944
02:05:47,121 --> 02:05:49,200
round and he,
the only thing he says about his dad,

2945
02:05:49,201 --> 02:05:52,500
I put one line in there about his dad,
which was,

2946
02:05:52,501 --> 02:05:57,501
you know,
he says my dad's gone a lot for his job 

2947
02:05:57,501 --> 02:05:57,501
and stuff that that's the only line.

2948
02:05:57,501 --> 02:06:00,930
So you Have an idea that the kid knows,
his dad knows that he's out there,

2949
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:02,880
he's working or doing whatever he's 
doing.

2950
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:06,180
But there's a lot of kids out there that
don't have a dad,

2951
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:11,240
they don't have an uncle jake.
And that was another reason why but 

2952
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:13,740
wrote the book because kids need to see 
and learn.

2953
02:06:13,990 --> 02:06:15,300
You know,
if you wouldn't have done martial arts,

2954
02:06:15,301 --> 02:06:16,110
who would have told you that,
hey,

2955
02:06:16,111 --> 02:06:18,630
if you work hard and you train,
you're going to get good at this.

2956
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:23,750
That would've,
if you would've done that with martial 

2957
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:25,431
arts,
you wouldn't done it with stand up 

2958
02:06:25,431 --> 02:06:26,541
comedy.
You wouldn't have done it with the rest 

2959
02:06:26,541 --> 02:06:26,541
of your career.
You would have said,

2960
02:06:26,541 --> 02:06:29,330
you know,
you would've gotten on the stage the 

2961
02:06:29,330 --> 02:06:29,330
first time for,
for,

2962
02:06:29,330 --> 02:06:30,000
for standup comedy,
you wouldn't have made anyone laugh.

2963
02:06:30,030 --> 02:06:32,550
You would have walked off set,
I suck and gone and got the job,

2964
02:06:32,551 --> 02:06:34,500
you know,
down at down at 7:11

2965
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:35,880
or whatever,
you know.

2966
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:37,200
that's.
Whereas if you,

2967
02:06:37,210 --> 02:06:38,250
if somebody said,
look man,

2968
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:40,200
of course you suck.
You just started.

2969
02:06:40,470 --> 02:06:45,470
Of course you suck.
Of course you don't know your times 

2970
02:06:45,470 --> 02:06:45,470
tables.
How would you know him?

2971
02:06:45,470 --> 02:06:48,680
You don't bond with that information.
Of course you're not good at standup 

2972
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:48,680
comedy.
You just did it for the first time.

2973
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:53,350
You got to learn how to do it.
Of course you're not good at standup 

2974
02:06:53,350 --> 02:06:53,610
fighting taekwondo.
You've never done It before,

2975
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:56,490
so you got to learn these things.
You got to put in the work.

2976
02:06:56,610 --> 02:06:58,200
You learn that lesson through martial 
arts.

2977
02:06:58,201 --> 02:06:59,580
A lot of kids don't get that 
opportunity.

2978
02:06:59,820 --> 02:07:04,820
I'm trying to give them that opportunity
to learn that with this book and even 

2979
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:05,940
for people that aren't kids like,
go do something you're not good at.

2980
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:08,130
It's really important.
It's good.

2981
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:10,230
Just try something,
pick up a new hobby,

2982
02:07:10,231 --> 02:07:13,190
pickup a new discipline,
try learning how to play chess.

2983
02:07:13,230 --> 02:07:18,230
Try to just do something you suck at and
let let your mind feel what it's like to

2984
02:07:18,391 --> 02:07:20,760
be at the beginning stages of 
improvement.

2985
02:07:20,761 --> 02:07:23,190
Again,
I think it's very invigorating.

2986
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:28,420
Not only that,
I mean factually that's good for your 

2987
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:28,420
brain.
You know,

2988
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:29,760
they say you're supposed to learn new 
languages,

2989
02:07:29,761 --> 02:07:31,560
learned to play chess,
learn to play guitar,

2990
02:07:31,770 --> 02:07:36,770
read new books.
You're supposed to do that stuff your 

2991
02:07:36,770 --> 02:07:36,770
whole life to continue.
That's what contInues to keep.

2992
02:07:36,770 --> 02:07:39,370
Just like your body falls apart.
If you don't exercise it,

2993
02:07:39,371 --> 02:07:41,350
your mind falls apart if you don't 
exercise it as well.

2994
02:07:41,470 --> 02:07:46,470
Yeah,
I definitely feel that if I don't do 

2995
02:07:46,470 --> 02:07:46,470
anything new for a long time,
I feel stagnant,

2996
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:51,560
but when I start doing something new,
especially something that I'm not good 

2997
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:51,560
at,
so I start thinking about it a lot.

2998
02:07:51,930 --> 02:07:54,240
I started obsessing about it a lot.
I get invigorated.

2999
02:07:54,241 --> 02:07:55,590
I get excited about going there.

3000
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:56,530
Yeah,
and we.

3001
02:07:56,610 --> 02:07:59,220
And we saw the same thing like when our 
first book came out.

3002
02:08:00,060 --> 02:08:01,200
It's a leadership book,
right,

3003
02:08:01,230 --> 02:08:02,220
and everyone thinks,
hey,

3004
02:08:02,221 --> 02:08:07,221
you know,
it's another leadership book and then 

3005
02:08:07,221 --> 02:08:07,221
when you read it,
people go,

3006
02:08:07,221 --> 02:08:07,221
oh,
wait a second,

3007
02:08:07,221 --> 02:08:09,480
this is like a new thought.
It's,

3008
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:11,700
it's a new thought I haven't seen before
and we'd have these.

3009
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:15,480
We have these things that we do where we
bring people in.

3010
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:17,460
Like it's usually we go out and work 
with a company,

3011
02:08:17,490 --> 02:08:19,860
we go out with one company and we go out
and we work with a company,

3012
02:08:20,130 --> 02:08:25,130
but we found that there were some 
smaller companies or people that 

3013
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:25,130
couldn't afford to bring us in.
So we said,

3014
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:26,280
okay,
what are we going to do about that?

3015
02:08:26,670 --> 02:08:30,570
So we made this thing up called the 
muster where we open it up to the public

3016
02:08:30,571 --> 02:08:35,571
to come and you know,
come and spend two days going through 

3017
02:08:35,941 --> 02:08:38,640
all these principles and it's the same 
thing that you're talking about.

3018
02:08:38,641 --> 02:08:41,250
THey say it's a challenge,
it's new thought.

3019
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:43,830
It's thinking about suffering from a 
different light.

3020
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:46,530
People that had been in leadership 
positions for five years,

3021
02:08:46,531 --> 02:08:47,490
10 years,
15 years,

3022
02:08:47,550 --> 02:08:48,360
and they go,
oh,

3023
02:08:48,361 --> 02:08:53,361
okay.
I can apply this new methodology that I 

3024
02:08:53,361 --> 02:08:53,361
haven't seen,
hadn't thought about before,

3025
02:08:53,361 --> 02:08:56,400
so they'll continue to grow and learn is
just so important across the board.

3026
02:08:56,670 --> 02:08:56,970
Yes.

3027
02:08:56,970 --> 02:09:01,970
Stepping outside of your comfort zone is
just one of the most important things 

3028
02:09:01,970 --> 02:09:02,190
for a human being.
For whatever reason.

3029
02:09:02,610 --> 02:09:03,960
I mean,
I don't know what it is,

3030
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:04,830
but I know what works.

3031
02:09:04,850 --> 02:09:07,100
Thanks.
And that's it.

3032
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:08,650
That's what it is,
man.

3033
02:09:08,651 --> 02:09:09,490
For me,
I'd like to.

3034
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:12,310
I've got a bunch of shit that I do that 
I suck at right now.

3035
02:09:12,690 --> 02:09:14,080
It's,
it's so important,

3036
02:09:14,081 --> 02:09:15,970
man.
I just started running really recently,

3037
02:09:15,971 --> 02:09:20,971
like within the last couple of months 
I've noticed that you've been posting 

3038
02:09:20,971 --> 02:09:20,971
about that dude.
I suck at it and I'm fuck,

3039
02:09:20,971 --> 02:09:21,340
I'm.
So.

3040
02:09:21,490 --> 02:09:23,590
It's crazy.
But you're getting a lot better.

3041
02:09:23,591 --> 02:09:25,240
A lot quicker though,
man.

3042
02:09:25,270 --> 02:09:30,270
Like your endurance jumps up quick,
like within a few weeks I was able to 

3043
02:09:30,270 --> 02:09:32,200
like way past areas.
Like,

3044
02:09:32,201 --> 02:09:33,080
I've got this,
um,

3045
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:37,090
this trail that's about two point seven 
miles through the hills,

3046
02:09:37,091 --> 02:09:41,680
like real steep hills and there are some
spots where I was just fucking dying and

3047
02:09:41,681 --> 02:09:46,681
now I can get through them and I can get
through them and get to the top and I'm 

3048
02:09:46,681 --> 02:09:48,140
still dying,
but I'm dying less time in yourself too.

3049
02:09:48,210 --> 02:09:50,750
So I'm trying to make the times.
And,

3050
02:09:51,130 --> 02:09:51,970
and then,
you know,

3051
02:09:51,971 --> 02:09:56,971
uh,
I just started wearing a heart rate 

3052
02:09:56,971 --> 02:09:56,971
watch to which,
uh,

3053
02:09:56,971 --> 02:09:57,250
I'll let my heart rate get down.
Don't like when I,

3054
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:57,940
when I,
uh,

3055
02:09:57,970 --> 02:10:00,310
when I have to take a break on these 
hill sprints,

3056
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:03,520
I'll get my heart rate down to 1:40
and then I'll start going again.

3057
02:10:04,620 --> 02:10:08,500
People asked me that too because when 
you get bored,

3058
02:10:08,530 --> 02:10:13,530
when you get bored of working out and 
also when you reach your physical 

3059
02:10:13,530 --> 02:10:15,070
limitations rights or you will reach 
your physical limitations on something,

3060
02:10:15,190 --> 02:10:20,190
you know,
like you're going to get down to a six 

3061
02:10:20,190 --> 02:10:20,190
minute mile,
let's say.

3062
02:10:20,190 --> 02:10:21,820
And then for you to take it past the six
minute mile,

3063
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:24,130
you're going to have to like stop 
lifting kettle bells,

3064
02:10:24,131 --> 02:10:25,570
get all skinny,
you know,

3065
02:10:25,690 --> 02:10:30,070
you'd go to a point where you are now,
that'd be your sole focus and I know,

3066
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:31,930
I'm guessing you wouldn't want to do 
that.

3067
02:10:31,931 --> 02:10:34,550
I know I wouldn't want to do that.
And so for me,

3068
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:36,980
I'm always jumping around from Canada 
from goal to goal,

3069
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:38,180
right?
Like I'll,

3070
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:40,250
maybe I'll be doing pull ups,
heavy pulse,

3071
02:10:40,630 --> 02:10:41,150
pulse,
pulse.

3072
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:44,720
So I was trying to get up my max pull 
ups and then I get to a point where,

3073
02:10:44,721 --> 02:10:46,790
okay now I'm,
I,

3074
02:10:46,930 --> 02:10:50,120
I'm not going to,
it's going to take every bit of focus in

3075
02:10:50,121 --> 02:10:54,320
my life to get to from from 58,
pull ups to 62.

3076
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:58,970
I don't want to do that.
So I'm cool with 52 and now I'm going to

3077
02:10:58,971 --> 02:11:01,340
start working on my dead lift or I'm 
going to start training jujitsu more.

3078
02:11:01,341 --> 02:11:04,510
I'm at and I'm just constantly 52 pups.
Yeah,

3079
02:11:04,540 --> 02:11:05,810
yeah,
yeah.

3080
02:11:05,870 --> 02:11:06,530
But like,
you know,

3081
02:11:06,590 --> 02:11:08,060
kipping pull ups,
not,

3082
02:11:08,090 --> 02:11:08,490
not,
not,

3083
02:11:08,510 --> 02:11:09,990
not just full dead hang.
Pull up.

3084
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:11,930
How many full dead hang pull ups.
Can you do it?

3085
02:11:12,410 --> 02:11:13,640
I don't know.
Probably 30 something.

3086
02:11:13,890 --> 02:11:15,320
Damn,
that's a lot.

3087
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:16,240
Are you,
uh,

3088
02:11:16,280 --> 02:11:18,020
do you do any,
do weighted ones at all?

3089
02:11:18,050 --> 02:11:18,800
Oh yeah.
Yeah,

3090
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:21,650
I do wait.
But the waist belt or do you use a vest?

3091
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:23,590
I have a weight belt and vests.
So I have like,

3092
02:11:23,610 --> 02:11:25,580
you have all set up in your basement,
is that what I'm looking at it?

3093
02:11:25,581 --> 02:11:26,130
Yeah,
it's my,

3094
02:11:26,131 --> 02:11:28,790
it's my garage,
my garage,

3095
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,610
which is you have a house.
Jim wright.

3096
02:11:31,611 --> 02:11:33,320
I mean it's a game changer.

3097
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:36,470
I hate to say it because not everyone 
can can make that happen and people live

3098
02:11:36,471 --> 02:11:38,060
in cramped quarters.
But man,

3099
02:11:38,061 --> 02:11:41,660
if you can even just get a pull up bar 
and it may be a set of rings.

3100
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:47,060
You can do so much.
And then he grab yourself one kettle 

3101
02:11:47,060 --> 02:11:49,891
bell.
if you have a yard and you have a 

3102
02:11:49,891 --> 02:11:49,891
kettlebell,
you could do a lot for sure.

3103
02:11:49,891 --> 02:11:49,891
Pull,
pull up.

3104
02:11:49,891 --> 02:11:52,580
Bars are so gigantic.
Well not really.

3105
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:55,010
All you need for a pull up bar is a 
ceiling.

3106
02:11:55,150 --> 02:11:55,820
No,
that's why I mean,

3107
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:57,470
I mean it's so gigantic.
Oh yeah,

3108
02:11:57,471 --> 02:11:58,250
yeah,
for sure.

3109
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:01,490
For sure.
And also it's so good for your shoulders

3110
02:12:01,491 --> 02:12:02,900
just to hang out,
you know,

3111
02:12:02,930 --> 02:12:04,310
at the end you're back.
Yeah.

3112
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:06,590
But if you have a pull up bar in your 
house,

3113
02:12:06,650 --> 02:12:08,690
you can do pull ups,
you can do pushups,

3114
02:12:08,691 --> 02:12:10,430
you can do squats,
you can do,

3115
02:12:10,630 --> 02:12:15,630
you know,
all kinds of burpees and everything 

3116
02:12:15,630 --> 02:12:15,630
else.

3117
02:12:15,630 --> 02:12:17,680
Sit ups and got work and you can pretty 
much get your whole body in really good 

3118
02:12:18,021 --> 02:12:20,780
shape with that one piece of equipment.
Yeah,

3119
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:21,680
yeah,
for sure.

3120
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:24,320
Yeah.
So when you set out your workouts,

3121
02:12:24,350 --> 02:12:26,170
do you,
do you write them down on paper?

3122
02:12:26,180 --> 02:12:27,620
Do you just have an idea what you want 
to do?

3123
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:30,080
I do write them down because I kind of 
logged what I'm doing,

3124
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:33,080
but I'll put down whatever exercise I'm 
going to do or whatever,

3125
02:12:33,190 --> 02:12:35,930
a bunch of exercises I'm going to do and
I'm logging down what I'm,

3126
02:12:36,230 --> 02:12:41,230
you know,
what my times are if I'm going for time 

3127
02:12:41,230 --> 02:12:41,230
or what the weights are,
if I'm going for weight and I'm,

3128
02:12:41,230 --> 02:12:42,980
I'm pretty.
I heard this the other day,

3129
02:12:42,981 --> 02:12:44,090
so I'm gonna say it.
Um,

3130
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:47,360
they said arnold was an instinctual 
trainer,

3131
02:12:47,450 --> 02:12:49,220
so I do that somewhat,
you know,

3132
02:12:49,221 --> 02:12:54,221
I'm not like looking at a book and I 
don't plan out for three weeks or a 

3133
02:12:54,221 --> 02:12:57,101
month in advance of exactly what I'm 
gonna do on that day because that day I 

3134
02:12:57,101 --> 02:12:57,160
might go damn it,
you know,

3135
02:12:57,320 --> 02:13:00,980
I'm not feeling that type of workout and
I'm,

3136
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:02,390
I need to not do it.

3137
02:13:02,450 --> 02:13:04,730
I'm going to do something else.
So I use my,

3138
02:13:04,731 --> 02:13:08,210
what my body's telling me somewhat.
That's not to say that I go,

3139
02:13:08,270 --> 02:13:13,270
hey,
I don't feel like doing anything to do 

3140
02:13:13,270 --> 02:13:13,270
today so I'm not going to do it because 
that's actually a rule that I have.

3141
02:13:13,270 --> 02:13:14,600
If I don't feel like doing something 
today,

3142
02:13:14,601 --> 02:13:19,601
I feel like I need a rest.
I'll do something that day and put the 

3143
02:13:19,601 --> 02:13:21,110
rest off to the next day.
Make yourself do it today.

3144
02:13:21,530 --> 02:13:23,690
And then if you still need it tomorrow,
you can take a rest.

3145
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:25,310
But you can't take a rest today.
Not allowed.

3146
02:13:25,570 --> 02:13:26,570
Ooh,
interesting.

3147
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:28,430
Do that to yourself.
You're your own boss.

3148
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:32,250
So when you write your stuff out,
do you have like log book to keep

3149
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:35,460
like a so you could go back and track 
progress and you look at yourself?

3150
02:13:35,490 --> 02:13:40,490
Yeah.
So like say if you're going to work out 

3151
02:13:40,490 --> 02:13:40,490
tomorrow,
do you plan it out tonight?

3152
02:13:40,490 --> 02:13:44,180
Nope.
I know kind of what I'm going to do 

3153
02:13:44,180 --> 02:13:45,030
tomorrow.
Tomorrow I'm going to do a bunch of ring

3154
02:13:45,031 --> 02:13:46,520
dips.
I'm going to do a bunch of dips.

3155
02:13:46,540 --> 02:13:50,080
I'm going to be doing a bunch of a 
parallel pushups.

3156
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:55,340
I'm going to do a tone of burpees and 
probably some that's going to round it 

3157
02:13:55,340 --> 02:14:00,021
out right now.
I have a little tweak on my knee right 

3158
02:14:00,021 --> 02:14:00,021
now so I can't sprint.
I'm like,

3159
02:14:00,021 --> 02:14:01,950
I normally would,
but otherwise I do be doing some sprints

3160
02:14:01,951 --> 02:14:03,470
in there too.
Yeah,

3161
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:04,950
jujitsu tweaks,
right?

3162
02:14:05,740 --> 02:14:07,180
Is that what it was?
Yeah,

3163
02:14:07,970 --> 02:14:10,400
it was fucking joints.
IT is in.

3164
02:14:10,410 --> 02:14:12,630
But if you think about how much time you
spend on the mat,

3165
02:14:13,240 --> 02:14:16,020
if I would have been playing basketball 
or playing soccer,

3166
02:14:16,021 --> 02:14:17,330
I'd still get the same worse.

3167
02:14:17,530 --> 02:14:21,810
Probably worse,
relatively injury free and this is not a

3168
02:14:21,811 --> 02:14:22,890
bad tweak.
It's just like,

3169
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:23,910
oh yeah,
we'll tweak.

3170
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:25,620
Well,
that's one thing that I try to impart on

3171
02:14:25,621 --> 02:14:30,621
people too,
that like strength and conditioning 

3172
02:14:30,621 --> 02:14:30,621
training,
particularly strength training.

3173
02:14:30,621 --> 02:14:33,240
It protects the joints for sure and the 
back and a lot of other issues.

3174
02:14:33,270 --> 02:14:38,270
I think that is why I have been 
relatively knock on wood injury free 

3175
02:14:39,660 --> 02:14:44,660
because two reasons I work out all the 
time and I never take any significant 

3176
02:14:44,941 --> 02:14:47,200
amount of time off.
I never say I'm not going to work out or

3177
02:14:47,201 --> 02:14:52,201
I never just fall into a hey,
I went through months or even two weeks 

3178
02:14:52,201 --> 02:14:55,320
or even five days for me to for me to 
not work out for five days.

3179
02:14:55,321 --> 02:14:57,000
There was some kind of like something 
happened.

3180
02:14:57,001 --> 02:15:02,001
I was like majorly sick or I was.
Even if I'm traveling I'll still get it 

3181
02:15:02,001 --> 02:15:02,001
done.

3182
02:15:02,001 --> 02:15:06,290
But I think that that consistency,
your body just is used to it and you 

3183
02:15:06,290 --> 02:15:09,891
don't,
you don't get hurt as often and you're 

3184
02:15:09,891 --> 02:15:09,891
like a hardcore metal guy.
Right?

3185
02:15:09,891 --> 02:15:12,030
Like what are you listening to?
I listened to.

3186
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:15,420
So I grew up on the east coast listening
to old school.

3187
02:15:15,421 --> 02:15:16,680
Hardcore music.
Yeah.

3188
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:18,480
And,
and you know,

3189
02:15:18,510 --> 02:15:22,320
so metal and hardcore bands like the bad
brains,

3190
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:26,550
a cro mags,
agnostic from just old school,

3191
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:28,560
hardcore bands from,
from.

3192
02:15:28,850 --> 02:15:30,030
Yeah.
From john.

3193
02:15:30,031 --> 02:15:32,550
Joseph is a trip to the cro mags.
Yeah.

3194
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:33,930
He's a fucking trip,
man.

3195
02:15:33,931 --> 02:15:36,270
I watched this documentary about him and
he's in his fifties,

3196
02:15:36,570 --> 02:15:38,970
tapes up his ankles and shit before 
shows,

3197
02:15:39,170 --> 02:15:43,080
like he's warming up and stretching out.
Does triathlons in between shows,

3198
02:15:43,550 --> 02:15:45,600
right.
Wrote a book called meat is for pussies.

3199
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:49,050
hardcore vegetarian.
Hari krishna.

3200
02:15:49,051 --> 02:15:50,630
Yeah.
I did.

3201
02:15:51,160 --> 02:15:53,400
The other guy,
the guy that founded that band,

3202
02:15:53,401 --> 02:15:55,020
the chromatics,
he's a,

3203
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:56,370
he's actually a buddy of mine.
He's a jujitsu guy.

3204
02:15:56,371 --> 02:15:57,700
It's a black belt in jujitsu,
but he,

3205
02:15:57,730 --> 02:16:02,730
he's,
he's had a completely insane life as 

3206
02:16:02,730 --> 02:16:02,730
well.
His name is harley flanagan and he,

3207
02:16:03,060 --> 02:16:07,830
his life's been completely insane,
isn't it?

3208
02:16:07,860 --> 02:16:09,750
Doesn't even really a doesn't mean 
there's hardly.

3209
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:12,570
There's hardly a picture.
Yeah,

3210
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:14,280
he's mad.
I actually,

3211
02:16:14,490 --> 02:16:19,490
it was interesting because I just had 
him on my podcast and it's,

3212
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:22,020
it was a different,
it was a different,

3213
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:23,700
you know,
guest for me,

3214
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:26,280
a different genre and people,
you know,

3215
02:16:26,370 --> 02:16:27,380
first of all,
the guy,

3216
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:29,400
you know,
people that listen to my podcast,

3217
02:16:30,730 --> 02:16:33,190
they expect a certain type of podcast,
right.

3218
02:16:33,191 --> 02:16:35,830
I'm going to talk about leadership,
I'm going to talk about the military and

3219
02:16:35,831 --> 02:16:40,831
all of a sudden I bring in this guy who 
has been a complete maniac and I mean 

3220
02:16:40,831 --> 02:16:40,831
he's done,
you know,

3221
02:16:40,831 --> 02:16:43,210
he was drugs,
drugs,

3222
02:16:43,211 --> 02:16:43,960
sex,
rock and roll.

3223
02:16:43,961 --> 02:16:47,470
It's basically been his whole life and 
since he was 10 years old,

3224
02:16:47,471 --> 02:16:49,570
he was playing in a punk rock band in 
New York city.

3225
02:16:50,300 --> 02:16:51,760
Shit,
he was,

3226
02:16:52,420 --> 02:16:54,810
when he was 10,
he was smoking.

3227
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:57,460
Fuck where his parents,
his mom was a hippie.

3228
02:16:57,580 --> 02:16:59,230
His dad was a roamer.
Never,

3229
02:16:59,380 --> 02:17:00,910
never,
never met his dad.

3230
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:06,420
And he is just,
he just grew up in the streets of the 

3231
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:09,691
lower east side in New York.
Did you go to New York city in the 

3232
02:17:09,691 --> 02:17:09,691
eighties at all?
Very little.

3233
02:17:09,691 --> 02:17:11,470
I found a tournament in New York in the 
19 eighties.

3234
02:17:11,471 --> 02:17:14,880
I remember driving there with some of 
the guys from boston,

3235
02:17:14,890 --> 02:17:17,890
we were driving to the city and looking 
at it going,

3236
02:17:17,891 --> 02:17:22,891
what the fuck is this place in New York 
in the eighties is completely different 

3237
02:17:23,081 --> 02:17:23,800
than it is now.

3238
02:17:24,070 --> 02:17:26,620
It was really,
really bad.

3239
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:31,680
It was filled with crime,
like 42nd street down in times square 

3240
02:17:31,680 --> 02:17:35,251
and when I was a kid I would go there 
because I was into this kind of music 

3241
02:17:35,251 --> 02:17:37,921
and dancing hardcore shows and metal 
shows and you'd get off the train and 

3242
02:17:37,921 --> 02:17:39,400
you get out in 40 secondary there'd be,
you know,

3243
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:41,050
every two steps,
drugs,

3244
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:42,490
dust,
crack,

3245
02:17:42,550 --> 02:17:47,550
everything and.
but that's where he grew up basically 

3246
02:17:47,550 --> 02:17:47,550
without parents.
and then he's got to just,

3247
02:17:47,550 --> 02:17:49,540
just a crazy,
crazy story.

3248
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:51,310
How old is he now?
He's 50.

3249
02:17:51,670 --> 02:17:56,670
He's still tRaining,
still just teaches kids class at hensel 

3250
02:17:56,670 --> 02:17:57,860
kids' instructor.
It ends up race in New York.

3251
02:17:58,210 --> 02:17:59,980
Wow,
that's amazing.

3252
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:01,450
Yeah,
that's cool.

3253
02:18:01,540 --> 02:18:06,070
But it was interesting because I had him
on the podcast and it was interesting to

3254
02:18:06,071 --> 02:18:10,900
have people that listen to it,
that listened to my podcast,

3255
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:11,950
which is very different,
you know,

3256
02:18:11,951 --> 02:18:13,480
you bring in basically all kinds of.

3257
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:18,480
You could get all kInds of such a 
completely wide variety of people in 

3258
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:22,960
here.
My guests have been basically war guys,

3259
02:18:22,961 --> 02:18:24,040
right?
Ryan,

3260
02:18:24,041 --> 02:18:25,750
stan,
tim kennedy,

3261
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:30,520
jody mitic was canadian sniper wounded 
real bad in Afghanistan.

3262
02:18:30,820 --> 02:18:34,600
I had a guy named colonel william reader
on there who was a pilot in Vietnam,

3263
02:18:34,601 --> 02:18:39,460
got shot down and got shot down twice,
actually captured in Vietnam,

3264
02:18:39,670 --> 02:18:44,170
was in captivity for a year and he's 
talking about he's in a,

3265
02:18:44,171 --> 02:18:49,171
in a bamboo cage with his leg shackled 
and he wakes up in the middle of the 

3266
02:18:49,451 --> 02:18:52,270
night because the rats are eating his 
wounds.

3267
02:18:52,570 --> 02:18:57,570
I mean,
I'm bringing on guys that are just 

3268
02:18:57,570 --> 02:18:58,030
talking about not only talking about 
heavy subjects,

3269
02:18:58,031 --> 02:19:00,430
but they're also talking about it from,
you know,

3270
02:19:00,490 --> 02:19:05,230
a very positive perspective of life.
Right.

3271
02:19:05,231 --> 02:19:07,000
I mean,
is there anyone more positive than,

3272
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:08,600
than brian stanford,
right.

3273
02:19:09,170 --> 02:19:10,080
Guys,
just like a,

3274
02:19:10,290 --> 02:19:11,650
just an amerIcan hero.

3275
02:19:11,650 --> 02:19:16,650
Right.
And so then I all of a sudden out of 

3276
02:19:16,650 --> 02:19:18,811
left field,
I bring on harley flanagan and he tells 

3277
02:19:18,811 --> 02:19:21,361
his story.
It was really interesting to me to have 

3278
02:19:21,361 --> 02:19:23,910
people's reactions.
And there was a couple of people that 

3279
02:19:23,910 --> 02:19:23,910
are like,
oh,

3280
02:19:23,910 --> 02:19:27,271
you know,
this was a real let down for you to 

3281
02:19:27,271 --> 02:19:27,271
bring them on.
But if you hear his story,

3282
02:19:27,271 --> 02:19:28,580
you listen to the whole podcast mean.
Here's a guy who,

3283
02:19:29,660 --> 02:19:33,230
who you can hear it in his voice,
like his,

3284
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:38,290
his hardest broken over some of the 
things that he's been through in his 

3285
02:19:38,290 --> 02:19:38,290
life.
Losing his father.

3286
02:19:38,290 --> 02:19:39,740
And his father was a,
was a heroin addict.

3287
02:19:39,741 --> 02:19:42,800
And,
and his father died,

3288
02:19:42,860 --> 02:19:47,420
burned alive in a dumpster as he lit a 
fire to try and keep himself warm.

3289
02:19:47,460 --> 02:19:49,170
Oh,
that's died.

3290
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:51,200
I'm buried.
His mom.

3291
02:19:51,201 --> 02:19:51,650
I mean,
it's just,

3292
02:19:51,651 --> 02:19:55,100
it's just a tragic story.
But my point is that the,

3293
02:19:55,430 --> 02:19:57,590
even though I had very few people that 
were like,

3294
02:19:57,591 --> 02:19:58,070
oh,
that was,

3295
02:19:58,071 --> 02:19:59,330
you know,
you shouldn't have.

3296
02:19:59,330 --> 02:20:00,560
He swore literally,
hey,

3297
02:20:00,561 --> 02:20:04,010
he swore a bunch on the podcast that's 
inappropriate or whatever.

3298
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:07,190
And then I was really that,
that was kind of,

3299
02:20:07,380 --> 02:20:07,750
well,
that's,

3300
02:20:07,910 --> 02:20:09,920
that's kind of too bad to hear,
hear someone say that,

3301
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:13,040
that they would have that viewpoint.
But what was really cool,

3302
02:20:13,041 --> 02:20:15,320
it was all these other people that are 
very straight laced,

3303
02:20:15,350 --> 02:20:19,730
kind of kind of middle road,
american people that listen to podcasts.

3304
02:20:19,731 --> 02:20:20,300
We're lIke,
dude,

3305
02:20:20,301 --> 02:20:22,820
thanks for having that guy on what a 
heart,

3306
02:20:22,821 --> 02:20:27,821
what a guy.
And it's good for me to know about that 

3307
02:20:27,821 --> 02:20:31,241
stuff and it's good for to hear someone 
that's been through the depths of drug 

3308
02:20:31,461 --> 02:20:34,760
addiction and hell come back out of it 
and do all right.

3309
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:36,230
And,
and again,

3310
02:20:36,231 --> 02:20:41,231
from my perspective,
I think that my interaction with those 

3311
02:20:41,601 --> 02:20:43,850
kinds of people when I was growing up,
which I certainly had,

3312
02:20:43,851 --> 02:20:44,870
you know,
I was a young kid,

3313
02:20:44,871 --> 02:20:47,570
go into New York and boston going to 
hardcore shows and all that.

3314
02:20:48,070 --> 02:20:51,740
It'll let me see part of the world that 
most people don't really see.

3315
02:20:51,770 --> 02:20:53,590
And so when I got in the military,
I got.

3316
02:20:53,591 --> 02:20:58,591
It was kind of used to dealing with 
people that people aren't used to 

3317
02:20:58,591 --> 02:20:58,700
dealing with.
And I think it helped me out a lot.

3318
02:20:58,790 --> 02:21:02,630
So is it a hard managing expectations 
once you don't mean how many?

3319
02:21:02,631 --> 02:21:04,970
What do you do?
You have like 75 episodes up already?

3320
02:21:05,240 --> 02:21:06,240
Yeah,
that's crazy.

3321
02:21:06,740 --> 02:21:10,670
Last time you here you had zero.
I love it though.

3322
02:21:11,050 --> 02:21:16,050
Getting after it and it's a lot of my 
podcast is a lot different than yours 

3323
02:21:16,050 --> 02:21:20,201
because I'm going deep on some subject 
that I'm actually going to like I have 

3324
02:21:20,201 --> 02:21:24,131
to study and prepare for and it's not 
interacting with another person most of 

3325
02:21:24,131 --> 02:21:28,541
the time.
Most of the time I'm interacting with 

3326
02:21:28,541 --> 02:21:28,541
history so it's,
it's harder for me to prepare.

3327
02:21:28,541 --> 02:21:30,800
Now.
Of course you've been preparing for this

3328
02:21:30,801 --> 02:21:32,270
podcast for 50 years,
right?

3329
02:21:32,271 --> 02:21:37,271
I mean that's what you,
you've been mentally preparIng for 

3330
02:21:37,271 --> 02:21:37,271
getting your experiences in your 
background.

3331
02:21:37,271 --> 02:21:39,380
But I have to like dive into stuff and.
And so it is hard.

3332
02:21:39,590 --> 02:21:40,160
My,
my,

3333
02:21:40,310 --> 02:21:42,470
my,
my point is yes,

3334
02:21:42,471 --> 02:21:44,630
it's hard for me to do a podcast a week,
I've got to read it.

3335
02:21:44,631 --> 02:21:48,290
But is it hard to manage expectations?
So I was getting after like.

3336
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:51,920
Because once you establish like a fan 
base,

3337
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:57,340
sometimes they have this idea in their 
head of what the podcast should be to 

3338
02:21:57,340 --> 02:21:58,280
them,
like what they want out of it,

3339
02:21:58,460 --> 02:22:03,460
and then they,
they can express that they don't like 

3340
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:03,460
where you're going,
like,

3341
02:22:03,460 --> 02:22:04,130
I don't like that you brought this 
harley guy on,

3342
02:22:04,131 --> 02:22:09,131
this guy's not what I like.
I like straight laced military guys who 

3343
02:22:09,131 --> 02:22:10,010
don't swear this guy's a fucking nutty 
dude.

3344
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:13,280
Jumps around on stage.
And the,

3345
02:22:13,910 --> 02:22:18,910
my answer to that is no.
And I'll tell you why from the beginning

3346
02:22:20,210 --> 02:22:23,390
of say know when you said it was you,
it was you and tim ferris,

3347
02:22:23,420 --> 02:22:28,420
you know,
both you guys said you should do a 

3348
02:22:28,420 --> 02:22:28,420
podcast.
And I said,

3349
02:22:28,420 --> 02:22:28,420
okay,

3350
02:22:28,420 --> 02:22:28,420
cool.
To this day,

3351
02:22:28,420 --> 02:22:29,700
your podcast with tim ferriss,
one of my all time favorite podcasts.

3352
02:22:30,090 --> 02:22:31,860
I listened to it in a,
in my.

3353
02:22:31,950 --> 02:22:32,760
I was,
I was cooking,

3354
02:22:32,761 --> 02:22:34,020
I was listening to my kitchen.
I was like,

3355
02:22:34,021 --> 02:22:36,450
jesus fucking christ.
It's a good podcast.

3356
02:22:36,451 --> 02:22:38,130
It was intense,
you know,

3357
02:22:38,131 --> 02:22:43,131
and it was a,
it was so deep and intense and I was 

3358
02:22:43,131 --> 02:22:43,131
like,
I gotta I gotta talk to this dude.

3359
02:22:43,131 --> 02:22:47,100
I got to get you one because I had known
you like from peripherally dean's fights

3360
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:50,460
and I'd seen you around,
but I didn't know who you were.

3361
02:22:50,730 --> 02:22:52,860
Didn'T know your story until tim had 
john.

3362
02:22:52,970 --> 02:22:54,480
Yeah.
In it.

3363
02:22:54,620 --> 02:22:57,020
And so you know tim again,
when he,

3364
02:22:57,050 --> 02:22:58,460
when he pressed stop on the,
on the,

3365
02:22:58,550 --> 02:23:01,190
on the recorder,
he said you should have your own podcast

3366
02:23:01,191 --> 02:23:06,191
and then you told me in the middle of 
the podcast you should have your own 

3367
02:23:06,191 --> 02:23:08,621
podcast and obviously when you two guys 
are telling me I should have my own 

3368
02:23:08,621 --> 02:23:08,960
podcast,
I'm being a complete idiot not to listen

3369
02:23:08,961 --> 02:23:09,200
to you.

3370
02:23:09,380 --> 02:23:11,120
Well you did.
Now it's a huge success,

3371
02:23:11,150 --> 02:23:13,460
which is hilarious.
I love when people listen.

3372
02:23:14,060 --> 02:23:17,210
Everyone listened to joe.
Listen to me about everything.

3373
02:23:17,930 --> 02:23:22,790
Be selective often wrong,
but as I've done it that

3374
02:23:23,270 --> 02:23:28,270
I've done,
you know what I want to do and if people

3375
02:23:28,460 --> 02:23:33,140
don't like it that that's okay.
I'm okay with someone saying,

3376
02:23:33,141 --> 02:23:33,740
hey,
you know what,

3377
02:23:34,040 --> 02:23:35,450
you're.
You know I did.

3378
02:23:35,451 --> 02:23:38,810
So I've done some episodes that were 
horrible,

3379
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:41,240
man.
I talked about the mee lai massacre.

3380
02:23:41,390 --> 02:23:42,860
If you don't know what that is,
the meal,

3381
02:23:42,861 --> 02:23:43,970
I'm asked her,
you know,

3382
02:23:43,971 --> 02:23:46,970
people talk about these atrocities that 
americans commit all the time.

3383
02:23:47,570 --> 02:23:49,850
Americans don't actually commit 
atrocities all the time,

3384
02:23:50,090 --> 02:23:55,090
but we have committed some heinous 
atrocities in this one is well 

3385
02:23:55,090 --> 02:23:57,380
documented Vietnam,
the mili massacre.

3386
02:23:57,800 --> 02:24:02,800
It was a company of soldiers going into 
a village and they raped,

3387
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:07,430
murdered,
killed around 500 people.

3388
02:24:07,610 --> 02:24:09,620
Just cold blood.
I mean it's,

3389
02:24:09,650 --> 02:24:11,270
it's heinous.
It's awful.

3390
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:17,200
Probably the hardest podcasts that I've 
done because I'm a patriotic guy and 

3391
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:19,220
here I am talking about,
you know,

3392
02:24:19,310 --> 02:24:24,310
american soldiers doing heinous acts to 
innocent people and,

3393
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:26,120
and so,
and I've done that.

3394
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:31,120
I did,
I did a podcast aBout the genocide in 

3395
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:31,120
Rwanda,
which was,

3396
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:33,500
if you don't know anything about that to
tribes,

3397
02:24:34,110 --> 02:24:36,240
and it's very hard for americans to 
understand this.

3398
02:24:36,350 --> 02:24:39,290
The difference between these two tribes 
is nothing.

3399
02:24:39,470 --> 02:24:41,720
It's just two tribes.
They speAk the same language.

3400
02:24:42,110 --> 02:24:44,090
They have the same,
they look the same.

3401
02:24:44,660 --> 02:24:46,550
They have the same religion,
which by the way,

3402
02:24:46,551 --> 02:24:49,820
the religion was catholicism because 
they'd been converted to catholicism.

3403
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:53,690
Well,
they went on a rampage and the hutus,

3404
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:57,010
which was one tribe,
murdered 800,000

3405
02:24:57,020 --> 02:25:00,440
tutsis in 100 days with machetes with 
machetes.

3406
02:25:01,910 --> 02:25:06,910
So I've covered these dark and horrible 
things on my podcast and,

3407
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:12,830
and I,
and I don't even know really 100 percent

3408
02:25:12,831 --> 02:25:17,831
why other than this thought in the back 
of my mind that I've always had,

3409
02:25:17,961 --> 02:25:22,961
which is that you have to kind of 
understand the darkness of the world in 

3410
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:26,530
order to appreciate the good in the 
world.

3411
02:25:26,740 --> 02:25:31,740
And that's why it was really interesting
to hear you talking to Jordan Peterson 

3412
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:33,430
because he covered that part.
You know,

3413
02:25:33,431 --> 02:25:34,150
he was saying,
look,

3414
02:25:34,210 --> 02:25:39,210
man is got a dark side and you won't 
become a good person unless you 

3415
02:25:39,210 --> 02:25:40,020
understand your dark side.
and,

3416
02:25:40,130 --> 02:25:44,050
and it's interesting for me because 
Jordan Peterson is clearly have a highly

3417
02:25:44,051 --> 02:25:47,860
intellectual and academic guy and I'm 
not right.

3418
02:25:47,861 --> 02:25:49,210
I'm,
I'm a nug,

3419
02:25:49,211 --> 02:25:54,211
right?
I joined the military after high school 

3420
02:25:54,211 --> 02:25:54,370
and,
and yet so many of the things he says,

3421
02:25:54,371 --> 02:25:55,360
when he says them,
I say,

3422
02:25:55,361 --> 02:26:00,361
oh yeah,
well that's the same thing I stumbled 

3423
02:26:00,361 --> 02:26:01,861
upon.
He came across that reading the the 

3424
02:26:01,861 --> 02:26:02,210
french philosopher or whatever,
and that's where he comes in.

3425
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:07,260
I came across it in life and so it's 
very interesting to me when I hear him 

3426
02:26:07,271 --> 02:26:07,780
say,
look,

3427
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:11,230
there's darkness in the world and 
there's evil in the world and we have to

3428
02:26:11,231 --> 02:26:12,180
face that,
and,

3429
02:26:12,200 --> 02:26:14,110
and as soon as I heard him saying that 
on the podcast,

3430
02:26:14,111 --> 02:26:14,470
I'm like,
well,

3431
02:26:14,471 --> 02:26:14,760
that's.

3432
02:26:14,870 --> 02:26:19,870
That's what I think and I can't give you
the philosophical basis for it like he 

3433
02:26:19,870 --> 02:26:24,091
can.
But I can tell you what I've lived 

3434
02:26:24,091 --> 02:26:25,681
through and I can tell you that if you 
don't understand the fact that there's 

3435
02:26:25,681 --> 02:26:28,540
darkness in the world and that people,
human beIngs are capable of evil things.

3436
02:26:29,410 --> 02:26:32,430
If you don't understand that,
you're not going to understand the,

3437
02:26:32,490 --> 02:26:33,670
the,
the first of all,

3438
02:26:33,671 --> 02:26:38,671
you're not gonna understand what you 
need to look out for in the world and 

3439
02:26:38,671 --> 02:26:40,180
what we need to be aware of as a society
and as a,

3440
02:26:40,210 --> 02:26:45,210
as a race of humans,
but also you're not going to appreciate 

3441
02:26:45,210 --> 02:26:48,550
things in the world that are beautiful 
and good and positive.

3442
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:54,000
So with the podcast,
I'm not doing it to make people happy,

3443
02:26:55,330 --> 02:27:00,330
I'm not doing it to make people listen.
I'm not even doing it to make people 

3444
02:27:00,330 --> 02:27:05,131
listen.
I'm doing it because it's things that 

3445
02:27:05,131 --> 02:27:08,461
I've lived through.
It's things that I want to understand 

3446
02:27:08,461 --> 02:27:10,210
better and I'm going to keep doing what 
I'm doing.

3447
02:27:10,420 --> 02:27:12,580
And if people like it,
then that's awesome.

3448
02:27:12,610 --> 02:27:13,900
And if people don't want to listen to 
it,

3449
02:27:13,960 --> 02:27:14,740
that's cool too.

3450
02:27:15,220 --> 02:27:17,020
Well,
at least from my personal experience,

3451
02:27:17,021 --> 02:27:20,470
listening to guys like Jordan Peterson 
or listening to yourself or listening to

3452
02:27:20,471 --> 02:27:23,380
anybody talk about really deep,
important subjects.

3453
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:26,890
Even if you know what they're saying to 
be true,

3454
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:31,950
it reinforces It in your own mind and 
maybe even opens up new doors of 

3455
02:27:31,950 --> 02:27:34,390
comprehension.
Jordan certainly did that with me when I

3456
02:27:34,391 --> 02:27:37,200
was listening to him talk.
Like he was saying some things like,

3457
02:27:37,210 --> 02:27:38,140
you know,
like,

3458
02:27:38,141 --> 02:27:43,141
uh,
like talking about dragons and dragons 

3459
02:27:43,141 --> 02:27:43,141
have gold.
I was like,

3460
02:27:43,141 --> 02:27:43,141
whoa,
jesus christ.

3461
02:27:43,141 --> 02:27:44,200
Like he was.
He was.

3462
02:27:44,260 --> 02:27:49,260
He was hitting some notes about human 
psychology and the reason why we behave 

3463
02:27:49,871 --> 02:27:54,871
in certain ways and the pitfalls of 
these certain types of behavior that I 

3464
02:27:54,871 --> 02:27:58,351
absolutely knew he was right,
but and maybe I'd even thought about 

3465
02:27:58,351 --> 02:28:00,580
them before,
but seeing them reinforced so eloquently

3466
02:28:00,730 --> 02:28:04,430
and seeing express so articulately,
it really like it.

3467
02:28:04,431 --> 02:28:07,900
It sparked life in my mind.
Yeah,

3468
02:28:07,900 --> 02:28:11,560
and even know he was talking about being
a warrior,

3469
02:28:11,620 --> 02:28:14,410
right,
and how these guys in modern times,

3470
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:17,380
we don't.
We don't spend time being a warrior.

3471
02:28:17,381 --> 02:28:20,410
If you and I were living in 500 years 
ago,

3472
02:28:20,411 --> 02:28:25,411
you and I would both be battle scarred 
and we would be used to that lifestyle.

3473
02:28:25,820 --> 02:28:27,500
People aren't used to that lifestyle 
now.

3474
02:28:27,501 --> 02:28:30,820
They've kind of forgotten what that 
feels like and so I'm.

3475
02:28:31,180 --> 02:28:36,180
That was my life.
I mean that was my life was to prepare 

3476
02:28:36,180 --> 02:28:36,320
for war and go fight war.
That was my whole life.

3477
02:28:36,740 --> 02:28:39,170
And so for me to look back on it noW and
here,

3478
02:28:39,171 --> 02:28:42,050
Jordan Peterson to say like,
that's normal.

3479
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:44,480
That's okay.
That's expected,

3480
02:28:44,810 --> 02:28:46,820
and it makes me say,
okay,

3481
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:51,430
I understand now were kind of part of 
part.

3482
02:28:51,650 --> 02:28:54,770
I understand myself better when I hear 
him say,

3483
02:28:54,771 --> 02:28:59,771
oh yeah,
this is this normal for guys to go out 

3484
02:28:59,771 --> 02:29:02,920
and fight wars.
This is the warrior mentality and when 

3485
02:29:02,920 --> 02:29:02,960
you come back and you tell the truth 
about it,

3486
02:29:03,650 --> 02:29:05,780
people will react to that in a positive 
way.

3487
02:29:05,781 --> 02:29:06,800
That's what he was saying about.
He was like,

3488
02:29:06,801 --> 02:29:07,130
hey,
look,

3489
02:29:07,131 --> 02:29:08,630
you're not,
you're not some,

3490
02:29:08,760 --> 02:29:13,760
you know,
academics sitting there reading a book 

3491
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:13,760
and in talking about what you're reading
in the book,

3492
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:13,760
you're like,
no,

3493
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:13,790
I live.
I'm a fighter.

3494
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,440
I fight.
I've been through this stuff.

3495
02:29:15,441 --> 02:29:20,441
I've had physical challenges.
That's why people are listening to what 

3496
02:29:20,441 --> 02:29:20,441
you're saying,
you know,

3497
02:29:20,580 --> 02:29:25,010
because you have that warrior mentality 
in your life.

3498
02:29:26,280 --> 02:29:31,280
Well,
I think that guys like Jordan Peterson 

3499
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:32,610
and I think that anybody that can tap 
into those truths that we know,

3500
02:29:32,910 --> 02:29:33,940
you know,
uh,

3501
02:29:34,260 --> 02:29:39,260
I just don't think we hear them enough.
I think we're inundated with so much 

3502
02:29:39,260 --> 02:29:41,150
stupid shit every day.
It's so hard to get to any like,

3503
02:29:41,190 --> 02:29:46,090
real substantial truths that will 
positively affect your,

3504
02:29:46,170 --> 02:29:50,040
both your outcome and your,
your outlook on life.

3505
02:29:50,340 --> 02:29:55,340
And I think you guys like you guys,
like tim ferriss is putting out all 

3506
02:29:55,340 --> 02:29:56,250
these amazing podcast,
Jordan Peterson,

3507
02:29:56,580 --> 02:30:01,580
all these people that can express things
to someone like this podcast literally 

3508
02:30:01,580 --> 02:30:04,260
has changed my life.
I mean it's changed my thinking.

3509
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:05,030
It's shit.
I'm a d,

3510
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:10,100
a totally different person than I was 
when I first started this podcast 

3511
02:30:10,100 --> 02:30:13,140
because talking to all these interesting
and fascinating people and wise people,

3512
02:30:13,500 --> 02:30:18,500
it's been like having some crazy crash 
course in a million different 

3513
02:30:20,311 --> 02:30:24,630
disciplines and a bunch of different 
conversations and seeing the pitfalls of

3514
02:30:24,631 --> 02:30:26,230
some people's thinking and,
and,

3515
02:30:26,260 --> 02:30:30,030
and being around people where you see 
the holes in their,

3516
02:30:30,130 --> 02:30:34,980
the way they express themselves or the 
way they process information.

3517
02:30:35,390 --> 02:30:40,390
And it made me recognize the holes in my
own processing and the way I used to 

3518
02:30:40,390 --> 02:30:41,100
communicate with people.
I'm just,

3519
02:30:41,101 --> 02:30:43,890
I'm a better.
I'm a better conversationalist now.

3520
02:30:44,130 --> 02:30:47,220
And it all comes from just having these 
intense conversations.

3521
02:30:47,430 --> 02:30:52,430
This,
this whole podcast thing is something 

3522
02:30:52,430 --> 02:30:55,251
that I never expected in life.
I never expected it was going to come 

3523
02:30:55,251 --> 02:30:55,320
along.
When it came along.

3524
02:30:55,321 --> 02:31:00,321
I never expected it would be something 
that I would do and I never expected it 

3525
02:31:00,321 --> 02:31:01,110
would be something I consume as much as 
I do.

3526
02:31:01,111 --> 02:31:03,510
I don't even have radio anymore in my 
fucking car.

3527
02:31:03,530 --> 02:31:04,980
No.
I listened to music.

3528
02:31:05,010 --> 02:31:10,010
If I listened to music and my music that
I get off itunes or it's something that 

3529
02:31:10,750 --> 02:31:13,320
someone like a new band that someone 
tells me returns,

3530
02:31:13,340 --> 02:31:16,080
it turns me on too,
but I don't listen to anybody.

3531
02:31:16,520 --> 02:31:20,070
Like I don't listen to satellite radio.
I don't to local radio.

3532
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:25,190
I listen to podcasts constantly.
One hundred percent and there's 

3533
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:26,850
something that is.
And I know even I experienced so.

3534
02:31:26,851 --> 02:31:30,030
So I what?
I'm 75 podcasts deep.

3535
02:31:30,031 --> 02:31:32,640
It's been going for a year and some 
change,

3536
02:31:33,060 --> 02:31:38,060
but when people come up to me now they,
they look me In the eyes and they shake 

3537
02:31:38,060 --> 02:31:42,921
my hand and they know me.
They know you and I kind of know them 

3538
02:31:42,921 --> 02:31:47,841
too.
Like they have these shared experiences 

3539
02:31:47,841 --> 02:31:48,960
with me and I talked about this on that,
on that podcast about Rwanda.

3540
02:31:49,230 --> 02:31:54,230
They talk about the fact that the first 
thing they do in a revolution in a coup 

3541
02:31:55,290 --> 02:32:00,290
is they want to take control of the 
radio and there's this great piece in 

3542
02:32:00,290 --> 02:32:03,540
there where he says,
they're talking about the fact that with

3543
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:08,190
tv you have to take what the image on 
the screen in your mind,

3544
02:32:08,191 --> 02:32:13,191
your eyes process it,
and then it goes into your brain with 

3545
02:32:13,191 --> 02:32:13,191
reading.

3546
02:32:13,191 --> 02:32:14,190
You take those words and they go in 
through your eyes and it processes.

3547
02:32:14,340 --> 02:32:18,690
It goes into your brain,
but with audio there's no filter.

3548
02:32:18,691 --> 02:32:23,691
The words are going directly into your 
brain where they're unfiltered and so 

3549
02:32:24,271 --> 02:32:29,271
it's this.
That's why I think this podcast audio 

3550
02:32:29,271 --> 02:32:31,560
format is so powerful because the people
that are listening to this right now,

3551
02:32:31,710 --> 02:32:36,710
they're sitting in the room with us.
They're here with us and when I'm 

3552
02:32:36,710 --> 02:32:40,940
recording my podcast,
I'm actually talking to them and they're

3553
02:32:41,131 --> 02:32:43,200
there and when I go out and I meet 
people,

3554
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:46,020
you can absolutely feel like,
hey,

3555
02:32:46,170 --> 02:32:48,960
and that the little inside jokes.
Because even though my mom talking about

3556
02:32:48,961 --> 02:32:52,040
how dark and evil my podcast is,
where we have a good time to.

3557
02:32:52,050 --> 02:32:55,210
When we have episodes that are funny and
we talk about regularly,

3558
02:32:55,220 --> 02:32:58,380
we talk about jujitsu and food and 
everything else working out and we,

3559
02:32:58,381 --> 02:33:03,381
we,
we have fun too and all those little 

3560
02:33:03,381 --> 02:33:03,900
inside jokes people will say the inside 
jokes to me that I never met this person

3561
02:33:03,901 --> 02:33:08,901
before but,
but he knows exactly what I'm talking 

3562
02:33:08,901 --> 02:33:08,901
about and,
and so it's,

3563
02:33:08,901 --> 02:33:12,890
it's a very,
very powerful medium that I think got 

3564
02:33:12,890 --> 02:33:16,041
skipped over and we went from radio just
completely absorbed into tv and then 

3565
02:33:17,761 --> 02:33:22,761
absorbed into the internet and now all 
of a sudden we got to this other side 

3566
02:33:22,761 --> 02:33:25,911
where we're back to this thing that 
there's some reason why people used to 

3567
02:33:25,911 --> 02:33:27,960
sit around that radio and listen to 
those radio shows back in the day.

3568
02:33:27,960 --> 02:33:29,190
Even I did,
you know,

3569
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:32,520
when I was a kid for whatever reason,
I liked radio shows.

3570
02:33:32,810 --> 02:33:35,850
Listen to dr demento,
dr sharma,

3571
02:33:35,910 --> 02:33:36,530
dr.
yeah.

3572
02:33:36,750 --> 02:33:41,750
I would sit there and listen to dr 
demento and they'd have those little 

3573
02:33:41,750 --> 02:33:44,271
radio shows and those skits and that was
a powerful medium and I knew it back 

3574
02:33:44,271 --> 02:33:45,300
then and so for,
for me,

3575
02:33:45,360 --> 02:33:46,020
like you,
you know,

3576
02:33:46,021 --> 02:33:51,021
as soon as,
as soon as you and tim were saying you 

3577
02:33:51,021 --> 02:33:51,240
should do your own podcast.
I was absolutely,

3578
02:33:51,241 --> 02:33:53,160
I'm going to do this and I'm going to 
every,

3579
02:33:53,161 --> 02:33:58,161
you know,
my goal is that when people press play 

3580
02:33:58,161 --> 02:34:01,580
on my podcast,
I want them to like be putting their 

3581
02:34:01,580 --> 02:34:02,220
headphones on and like stretching their 
neck a little bit,

3582
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:04,500
pressing play and then,
and then just going,

3583
02:34:04,501 --> 02:34:05,480
okay,
this is,

3584
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:11,120
I want them to get absorbed in it.
That's my goal was well there's also 

3585
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:13,170
nothing else like it in terms of like 
that you can have,

3586
02:34:13,171 --> 02:34:14,530
you only have one guy you work with,
right?

3587
02:34:14,531 --> 02:34:16,010
Echo charles.
Yup.

3588
02:34:16,410 --> 02:34:18,160
So it's you and him and that's

3589
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:19,960
it.
Like there's not like a whole team.

3590
02:34:19,961 --> 02:34:21,080
If you had a,
the,

3591
02:34:21,090 --> 02:34:26,090
the audience that you have,
I know that you guys are a shit ton of 

3592
02:34:26,090 --> 02:34:26,090
downloads now.
So the,

3593
02:34:26,090 --> 02:34:28,150
that kind of audience,
if you are on a radio show,

3594
02:34:28,151 --> 02:34:31,330
you'd have a successful radio show,
so you'd be in a studio somewhere,

3595
02:34:31,331 --> 02:34:33,970
you'd have a network behind you,
you'd have to have production meetings,

3596
02:34:34,150 --> 02:34:36,850
you'd have to have a bunch of people 
that would tell you what the thought was

3597
02:34:36,851 --> 02:34:41,851
going to say.
I'd have people telling me what I could 

3598
02:34:41,851 --> 02:34:45,821
and couldn't say.
People telling me to stop or do an 

3599
02:34:45,821 --> 02:34:49,260
advertisement right now and we'll know.
And that's the beautiful thing about it 

3600
02:34:49,260 --> 02:34:53,851
and you know,
I know we're leaving money on the table 

3601
02:34:53,851 --> 02:34:55,810
because right now all these advertisers 
that come to us and they say,

3602
02:34:55,811 --> 02:34:57,820
hey can you talk about this and can you 
talk about that and can you.

3603
02:34:57,880 --> 02:34:59,260
And they want to pay us money.
And I'd just like,

3604
02:34:59,261 --> 02:35:00,250
nope,
we're not doing it.

3605
02:35:00,490 --> 02:35:02,260
We have one we have on it because it's 
your,

3606
02:35:02,350 --> 02:35:03,520
your boys,
your company.

3607
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:05,470
And you helped me in the beginning.
So.

3608
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:08,320
And good products.
But that's it.

3609
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:13,440
That's all.
That's the only advertisement we have 

3610
02:35:13,440 --> 02:35:15,360
not doing anybody else.
And so there's no one that can tell me 

3611
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:16,900
what to do a lot.
That's a beautiful thing.

3612
02:35:17,110 --> 02:35:22,110
There's a lot to that.
There's a lot to it and also not 

3613
02:35:22,110 --> 02:35:22,600
interrupting your podcast is giant.
Not ever.

3614
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:27,660
Never breaking up that thought.
Just keeping that thing going to the 

3615
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:27,660
end.
Say thank you very much.

3616
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:29,890
See you guys next week.
Boom,

3617
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:35,160
and I just think that people get locked 
up in this is sort of like almost like a

3618
02:35:35,411 --> 02:35:38,620
trance of the way you're thinking there.
They're in jockos mind,

3619
02:35:38,621 --> 02:35:41,950
you're talking and they're thinking how 
your thinking.

3620
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:44,530
They're like allowing themselves to be 
taken on this journey,

3621
02:35:44,531 --> 02:35:46,360
whether they're in their car,
whether they're at the gym,

3622
02:35:46,480 --> 02:35:51,480
they're absorbed in your thoughts in a 
very unique way and because of the fact 

3623
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:52,900
there's not a whole lot of other people 
contributing in it and entering into the

3624
02:35:52,901 --> 02:35:53,970
picture,
you know,

3625
02:35:53,980 --> 02:35:58,390
like producers and network executives 
and advertising agencies and look,

3626
02:35:58,391 --> 02:36:01,300
we've looked at the stats and john go,
you've got to talk more about this.

3627
02:36:01,301 --> 02:36:06,301
And you know what I mean?
You could geT lost in analytics and 

3628
02:36:06,301 --> 02:36:07,030
never find your true voice,
but podcasts,

3629
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:09,720
it's almost entirely your true.
It's so it,

3630
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:11,770
it's,
I don't want to say low tech,

3631
02:36:11,771 --> 02:36:13,720
it's not low tech,
but it's low.

3632
02:36:13,990 --> 02:36:17,200
There's a small amount of voices,
you know,

3633
02:36:17,201 --> 02:36:22,201
in terms of each individual podcast.
it's just your voice and if maybe like 

3634
02:36:22,201 --> 02:36:23,290
mine,
it's mine and the guest and whoever else

3635
02:36:23,291 --> 02:36:24,730
comes in,
that's it.

3636
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:29,940
There's not a lot of other Intrusion and
that's where you mean singular visions 

3637
02:36:30,101 --> 02:36:35,101
is what makes some,
it's like there's a reason why netflix 

3638
02:36:35,101 --> 02:36:39,211
does so well.
And the reason why a lot of these hbo 

3639
02:36:39,211 --> 02:36:40,420
shows dose well is because they leave 
those people alone.

3640
02:36:40,480 --> 02:36:41,380
They just go make,
uh,

3641
02:36:41,410 --> 02:36:43,150
make us game of thrones will be back 
here.

3642
02:36:43,180 --> 02:36:48,180
Go ahead.
What are you gonna do you're gonna make 

3643
02:36:48,180 --> 02:36:48,180
a comedy special.
You know,

3644
02:36:48,180 --> 02:36:48,180
I did my last comedy special with 
netflix.

3645
02:36:48,180 --> 02:36:50,320
They have fucking zero notes for me.
Zero.

3646
02:36:50,321 --> 02:36:52,600
I've never done a goddamn thing where 
they didn't say,

3647
02:36:52,601 --> 02:36:57,601
you can't talk about this.
You can't put that bit in and can see 

3648
02:36:57,601 --> 02:36:57,670
the only thing I've ever done where they
said we love it.

3649
02:36:57,860 --> 02:36:59,110
Like that's it.
Yeah.

3650
02:36:59,111 --> 02:37:00,190
Do it.
Go kick ass.

3651
02:37:00,490 --> 02:37:01,510
Okay.
Like,

3652
02:37:01,511 --> 02:37:03,130
literally that was it.
I love that joke.

3653
02:37:03,131 --> 02:37:04,240
You're going to do that one.
I'll do it.

3654
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:09,280
Yeah.
I actually told that to my publisher 

3655
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:09,670
about my publisher.
I was like,

3656
02:37:09,700 --> 02:37:14,700
you know what?
The best thing about my podcast is is 

3657
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:14,700
that no,
I can do whatever I want to do.

3658
02:37:14,770 --> 02:37:16,070
I can whatever I want to do.

3659
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:19,040
And that's what makes it.
It's very,

3660
02:37:19,041 --> 02:37:20,960
very liberating.
There's no control mean you write,

3661
02:37:21,070 --> 02:37:26,070
write a book,
you know someone's going to edit that 

3662
02:37:26,070 --> 02:37:26,070
thing,
they're going to change this and they're

3663
02:37:26,070 --> 02:37:26,690
going to adjust that and they want the 
cover to look like this.

3664
02:37:26,920 --> 02:37:31,310
The podcast is,
it is just you and you know,

3665
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:34,940
even the first,
my first podcast came out and you know,

3666
02:37:34,941 --> 02:37:39,941
my wife lifts.
I've listened to it and she was all 

3667
02:37:39,941 --> 02:37:41,540
stoked because when was the last time 
that you sat down and talk,

3668
02:37:41,541 --> 02:37:44,000
just talk to your wife for two and a 
half hours,

3669
02:37:44,060 --> 02:37:46,850
right?
It doesn't happen and my wife was like,

3670
02:37:46,910 --> 02:37:47,630
hey,
where's awesome?

3671
02:37:47,660 --> 02:37:51,350
Like she got to know me better.
I do it for 20 years.

3672
02:37:51,500 --> 02:37:56,500
She got to know me better because she 
got to sit and listen to me talk for two

3673
02:37:56,511 --> 02:38:01,511
and a half hours and now she,
she's listening to every single one of 

3674
02:38:01,511 --> 02:38:01,511
them and she's.
She knows.

3675
02:38:01,511 --> 02:38:04,920
She actually knows me better than she 
did before the podcast started because I

3676
02:38:04,921 --> 02:38:08,060
got a wife and four kids and jobs and 
have bork and travel and all that.

3677
02:38:08,061 --> 02:38:13,061
She,
I don't have time to sit there and talk 

3678
02:38:13,061 --> 02:38:13,061
to my wife for for two and a half hours.
Hey,

3679
02:38:13,130 --> 02:38:16,010
maybe I'm a bad person,
but that's just the reality of life.

3680
02:38:16,380 --> 02:38:16,800
Yeah.
Well,

3681
02:38:16,801 --> 02:38:17,850
you know what?
Honestly,

3682
02:38:17,851 --> 02:38:22,851
when do you ever get a chance to sit 
like this across from someone and talk 

3683
02:38:22,851 --> 02:38:26,431
to them for three hours without checking
your phone or that anybody coming into 

3684
02:38:26,431 --> 02:38:29,721
the room without anybody interrupting 
you with something you have to do or 

3685
02:38:29,721 --> 02:38:30,270
someplace you have to be?
it's very odd.

3686
02:38:30,420 --> 02:38:32,610
It's.
That's one of the things that I say.

3687
02:38:32,700 --> 02:38:37,700
One of the reasons why I say that it 
changed my life is because it educated 

3688
02:38:37,700 --> 02:38:39,930
me on other people's thought processes 
in a way that you just don't.

3689
02:38:39,990 --> 02:38:42,380
You don't get one on one dialogue with 
people.

3690
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:44,260
If you think about it,
you know,

3691
02:38:44,350 --> 02:38:46,270
as we talk about going back to these 
primal things,

3692
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:51,360
there's a primal thing about having a 
human conversation and if you think 

3693
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:54,811
about where technology is going,
we don't have much human conversation.

3694
02:38:54,910 --> 02:38:57,730
So you're a hundred percent right.
Not only might not having two and a half

3695
02:38:57,731 --> 02:39:02,731
hour conversations with my wife,
I'm not having two and a half hour 

3696
02:39:02,731 --> 02:39:05,401
conversations with anybody,
anybody until I come up here and sit 

3697
02:39:05,401 --> 02:39:07,410
down with you or until I go into my 
podcast studio and I sit down and I have

3698
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:09,370
it a two and a half hour conversation 
with,

3699
02:39:09,580 --> 02:39:14,580
you know,
a million people that are going to sit 

3700
02:39:14,580 --> 02:39:16,561
there and listen and they're going to 
give me feedback on twitter and they're 

3701
02:39:16,561 --> 02:39:16,750
going to tell me this and they're going 
to tell me their story.

3702
02:39:16,751 --> 02:39:18,790
And it's,
it's very,

3703
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:20,560
it's,
we're filling a hole.

3704
02:39:20,561 --> 02:39:24,280
I think it was a hole in communication 
right now because you know,

3705
02:39:24,310 --> 02:39:25,550
we text each other,
you know,

3706
02:39:25,660 --> 02:39:26,560
you and me text each other.

3707
02:39:26,980 --> 02:39:27,910
I text,
I text echo,

3708
02:39:27,911 --> 02:39:29,070
I texted everybody,
texted my wife,

3709
02:39:29,130 --> 02:39:31,060
think you and I've ever had a 
conversation on the phone.

3710
02:39:31,100 --> 02:39:32,110
No,
no,

3711
02:39:33,540 --> 02:39:36,650
that's the word we're living in.
People just text.

3712
02:39:36,780 --> 02:39:38,930
It's just weird.
It's weird.

3713
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:40,300
I'm like legit things.
Hey,

3714
02:39:40,301 --> 02:39:41,320
I gotta send you something.
Here's,

3715
02:39:41,380 --> 02:39:46,380
I just pull them out just like that's 
the way it is and it's totally 

3716
02:39:46,380 --> 02:39:50,191
acceptable,
but there's something missing and if we 

3717
02:39:50,191 --> 02:39:50,191
can't,
you know,

3718
02:39:50,191 --> 02:39:50,770
the next level is like,
well we're going to roll.

3719
02:39:50,830 --> 02:39:55,830
You know what I mean?
Like that's the next thing is you 

3720
02:39:55,830 --> 02:39:55,830
trained together.
but there's,

3721
02:39:55,830 --> 02:39:57,070
there's a,
there's a gap and in human contact right

3722
02:39:57,071 --> 02:39:58,630
now.
But in having conversations,

3723
02:39:58,631 --> 02:40:00,880
and I'm just thinking of this right now 
that this,

3724
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:05,900
the whole nature of podcasting fills 
that hole and if you look at the 

3725
02:40:05,951 --> 02:40:10,951
podcasts that do well,
it's podcasts that are conversational 

3726
02:40:11,461 --> 02:40:13,810
list.
Unless you go with the podcast,

3727
02:40:13,830 --> 02:40:14,220
it's highly

3728
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:15,960
produced and they got they,
you know,

3729
02:40:16,010 --> 02:40:21,010
because like radio lab,
all of those ones that are highly 

3730
02:40:21,010 --> 02:40:21,010
produced and even the ones that are 
produced by,

3731
02:40:21,010 --> 02:40:21,780
you know,
npr,

3732
02:40:21,781 --> 02:40:24,410
so they have real money behind them and 
they're there.

3733
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:29,420
They're a different thing,
but for normal dudes that are just 

3734
02:40:29,420 --> 02:40:30,540
sitting around and talking,
those are popular podcasts.

3735
02:40:30,541 --> 02:40:31,590
That's why tim,
sam harris,

3736
02:40:31,591 --> 02:40:36,591
those guys are sitting around and 
talking and explaining stuff because 

3737
02:40:36,591 --> 02:40:37,230
that doesn't exist anymore in the in the
day to day life.

3738
02:40:37,231 --> 02:40:42,231
For a lot of people,
you know what else doesn't exist in a 

3739
02:40:42,231 --> 02:40:42,930
day to day life,
a place where it's okay to be a man.

3740
02:40:44,600 --> 02:40:49,600
It's actually okay to be a man.
It's okay to have thoughts like 

3741
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:51,390
everybody is so,
so toned down and neutered.

3742
02:40:51,870 --> 02:40:56,870
it's like human resources and corporate 
life has watered down people's natural 

3743
02:40:57,361 --> 02:41:00,780
behavior to the point where people are 
just dying on the inside,

3744
02:41:01,020 --> 02:41:03,150
sitting in these fucking cubicles 
rotting.

3745
02:41:03,540 --> 02:41:05,820
Just freaking the fuck out.
Having all these thoughts,

3746
02:41:05,821 --> 02:41:08,800
they can entertain having to pretend to 
be someone there.

3747
02:41:08,830 --> 02:41:12,840
They are not all day long putting on 
this bullshit way of talking,

3748
02:41:12,841 --> 02:41:16,470
this fake way of thinking.
Everybody's got to subscribe to whatever

3749
02:41:16,471 --> 02:41:20,460
fucking ridiculous policies their 
company wants to enforce and you're just

3750
02:41:20,461 --> 02:41:25,461
a robot and you get out of there and you
just want to scream or you want to 

3751
02:41:25,461 --> 02:41:25,860
listen.
To some guys talk about some real shit.

3752
02:41:25,861 --> 02:41:27,180
Real shit.
Yeah.

3753
02:41:27,181 --> 02:41:28,440
And then go,
fuck.

3754
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:30,960
How come I can't talk about real shit?
you know,

3755
02:41:31,100 --> 02:41:34,020
it's another reason why I wrote the kids
book because the kid's book,

3756
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:37,590
instead of it being about,
hey,

3757
02:41:37,710 --> 02:41:40,470
if someone's picking on you,
go and tell the teacher.

3758
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:41,490
It's like,
no.

3759
02:41:41,491 --> 02:41:46,491
actually if somebody's picking on you,
learn to defend yourself and kick their 

3760
02:41:46,491 --> 02:41:47,400
ass if needed.
That's that.

3761
02:41:47,480 --> 02:41:48,210
That hasn't been said.

3762
02:41:48,210 --> 02:41:49,410
It's another reason I wrote the book.
I,

3763
02:41:49,690 --> 02:41:51,420
I,
I've toLd this story before,

3764
02:41:51,421 --> 02:41:53,520
but I went and got some book for my kid 
when he was little.

3765
02:41:53,521 --> 02:41:54,930
My,
my one son and three daughters.

3766
02:41:55,170 --> 02:41:57,030
I went and got a book from ms.
It was like a pirate book.

3767
02:41:57,060 --> 02:41:58,230
Right?
And I'm thinking,

3768
02:41:58,380 --> 02:42:03,380
cool pirates are going to burn stuff.
Takeover villages or steal things.

3769
02:42:03,960 --> 02:42:08,960
This will be awesome.
And I read the book and it's just 

3770
02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:09,990
complete.
These guys are complete,

3771
02:42:10,620 --> 02:42:12,200
you know,
pathetic.

3772
02:42:12,201 --> 02:42:13,560
They're pathetic.
They're not fake.

3773
02:42:13,570 --> 02:42:14,310
Pirate,
fake.

3774
02:42:14,490 --> 02:42:16,260
They're not manly pirates.
Right.

3775
02:42:16,620 --> 02:42:20,850
And I just was so embarrassed by some.
I don't even check check.

3776
02:42:20,970 --> 02:42:25,970
I threw it away.
And you can't learn from a pirate that 

3777
02:42:26,191 --> 02:42:28,770
you got to go out and crush some things 
sometimes.

3778
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:31,440
Then we got to just check ourselves 
because guess what?

3779
02:42:31,590 --> 02:42:33,360
Life is.
That's what life is.

3780
02:42:33,400 --> 02:42:36,900
That's another thing that we shield kids
from these days.

3781
02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:40,140
Life is hard.
You don't get a trophy.

3782
02:42:40,530 --> 02:42:45,530
You don't get it.
There's no such thing as a trophy for 

3783
02:42:45,530 --> 02:42:45,530
participation.
That's fake.

3784
02:42:45,530 --> 02:42:48,720
It's a lie doesn't exist.
You can't learn your times tables.

3785
02:42:48,780 --> 02:42:50,580
Guess what?
You need to work and study.

3786
02:42:50,581 --> 02:42:53,360
You don't get put into a special class 
and get a tutor and maybe you get a,

3787
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:56,160
you know you got some special help to 
get.

3788
02:42:56,161 --> 02:42:57,810
No,
you need to work and make that happen.

3789
02:42:58,050 --> 02:42:58,750
You don't know.
Don't,

3790
02:42:58,810 --> 02:43:00,240
don't know how to swim.
Guess what?

3791
02:43:00,690 --> 02:43:02,010
That doesn't mean you stay away from the
water.

3792
02:43:02,011 --> 02:43:03,690
No,
you learn how to swim.

3793
02:43:03,930 --> 02:43:05,760
You step up,
you man up.

3794
02:43:05,790 --> 02:43:08,490
That's what you do.
So that's another reason why I wrote the

3795
02:43:08,491 --> 02:43:12,010
book so that people can actually.
Kids can learn that

3796
02:43:12,490 --> 02:43:15,190
life is hard.
And in order to deal with life,

3797
02:43:15,400 --> 02:43:16,210
you got to be hard.

3798
02:43:16,760 --> 02:43:19,040
Yeah.
And just this idea that life is hard.

3799
02:43:19,070 --> 02:43:20,870
Something you're supposed to shield from
them.

3800
02:43:20,900 --> 02:43:25,900
It's so silly and you know,
I've had this conversation with my 

3801
02:43:25,900 --> 02:43:28,871
friends because everybody that I know 
that's interesting how to fucked up 

3802
02:43:28,871 --> 02:43:28,871
life,
but,

3803
02:43:28,871 --> 02:43:33,850
but now we have kids and the last thing 
we want is our kids to have a fucked up 

3804
02:43:33,850 --> 02:43:37,151
life.
So we put our kids in these good 

3805
02:43:37,151 --> 02:43:37,151
schools.
We live in these nice neighborhoods.

3806
02:43:37,151 --> 02:43:41,290
Everybody eats healthy and there's no 
fucking domestic violence and everybody 

3807
02:43:41,290 --> 02:43:43,520
seems it's,
it's so different than all of our lives.

3808
02:43:43,610 --> 02:43:48,610
And we were talking about it,
me and brian calendar actually talking 

3809
02:43:48,610 --> 02:43:48,610
about it like,
look,

3810
02:43:48,610 --> 02:43:52,211
we all have fucked up childhoods and 
everybody we know had fucked up 

3811
02:43:52,211 --> 02:43:53,960
childhoods and they're all interesting 
but I don't want my kids to be boring,

3812
02:43:53,961 --> 02:43:56,720
but I also want them to be safe.
So it's like,

3813
02:43:56,780 --> 02:43:58,370
how do you,
how do you approach that?

3814
02:43:58,640 --> 02:44:03,640
I think you'd get involved is what I've 
chosen to do is get my kids involved in 

3815
02:44:03,640 --> 02:44:03,640
martial arts and and,
and,

3816
02:44:03,640 --> 02:44:08,410
and give them the opportunity to pursue 
difficult things and understanding that 

3817
02:44:08,410 --> 02:44:11,400
through pursuing these difficult things 
like in accomplishing stuff like you,

3818
02:44:11,401 --> 02:44:16,401
you learned something about yourself.
You learn that you have this ability 

3819
02:44:16,401 --> 02:44:16,401
inside of you to overcome.

3820
02:44:16,401 --> 02:44:19,310
I've got this statement that I made on 
my podcast about kids and I said,

3821
02:44:19,311 --> 02:44:24,311
if you're helping your kids,
you're hurting them and if you think 

3822
02:44:24,891 --> 02:44:25,620
about it,
right,

3823
02:44:25,790 --> 02:44:28,340
and the example I gave is like tying 
your kids' shoe.

3824
02:44:28,580 --> 02:44:31,100
If you tie your kids' shoe,
you're,

3825
02:44:31,220 --> 02:44:36,220
you're actually taking away the 
opportunity in their life to develop 

3826
02:44:36,220 --> 02:44:40,871
their fine motor skills of tying a shoe.
You're actually taking that away from 

3827
02:44:40,871 --> 02:44:40,970
them.
And it's the same with everything.

3828
02:44:41,030 --> 02:44:43,160
Make your own sandwich,
make your own bed,

3829
02:44:43,161 --> 02:44:48,161
clean your own room.
You need to do this stuff for yourself 

3830
02:44:48,161 --> 02:44:48,161
and when I'm helping you,
you're hurting you.

3831
02:44:48,161 --> 02:44:51,350
So I think we can.
I think we can protect them without just

3832
02:44:51,351 --> 02:44:56,351
completely coddling them and then making
sure that every issue that ever could 

3833
02:44:56,511 --> 02:45:01,511
present itself to them has been 
eliminated because you're gonna end up 

3834
02:45:01,511 --> 02:45:01,511
with some kids.

3835
02:45:01,511 --> 02:45:05,630
Yeah,
and if those kids have to compete with 

3836
02:45:05,630 --> 02:45:05,630
some kid has had to take care of himself
their whole life,

3837
02:45:05,630 --> 02:45:06,220
that kid's gonna be ferocious.
yup.

3838
02:45:06,300 --> 02:45:11,300
Yeah.
You're going to have a feral kid 

3839
02:45:11,300 --> 02:45:12,090
competing against.
You're a little soft fleece lined kid.

3840
02:45:12,490 --> 02:45:12,870
Yeah.
No,

3841
02:45:12,871 --> 02:45:17,871
that's,
that's why some of those competItive 

3842
02:45:17,871 --> 02:45:17,871
sports are,
are so important.

3843
02:45:17,871 --> 02:45:18,250
You know,
whether it's an martial arts are great,

3844
02:45:18,251 --> 02:45:19,890
wrestling is great jujitsu,
but you know,

3845
02:45:19,900 --> 02:45:20,800
football,
basketball,

3846
02:45:20,801 --> 02:45:24,770
anything thing that puts you in those 
challenging positions where you're going

3847
02:45:24,771 --> 02:45:26,830
to have to step up,
you're going to get ground out.

3848
02:45:27,100 --> 02:45:29,080
And like my one of my daughters 
wrestles.

3849
02:45:29,350 --> 02:45:31,750
Well yeah.
And she is,

3850
02:45:32,200 --> 02:45:37,200
you know,
this is the same one that got stage 

3851
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:37,900
fright and to see her step up and you 
know,

3852
02:45:37,901 --> 02:45:39,010
we live a pretty good life,
right?

3853
02:45:39,011 --> 02:45:40,930
I mean it's,
we live in southern California,

3854
02:45:41,050 --> 02:45:42,830
we live in a nice house.
It's,

3855
02:45:42,860 --> 02:45:44,200
it's,
it's a nice living.

3856
02:45:44,201 --> 02:45:46,150
Right?
it's a very comfortable situation.

3857
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:50,020
Some of the hardest times that she's 
been put through is on the wrestling mat

3858
02:45:50,170 --> 02:45:55,170
and having to step up against some girl 
that like the exact girl you're talking 

3859
02:45:55,170 --> 02:45:57,070
about.
Some girl from the barrio in san diego,

3860
02:45:57,190 --> 02:46:02,190
that's a tough ass girl that's been 
through the ringer and has domestic 

3861
02:46:02,190 --> 02:46:06,991
violence going on at her house and her 
one escape from all that is to come out 

3862
02:46:06,991 --> 02:46:07,510
and wrestle against some other girl and 
beat her down.

3863
02:46:08,020 --> 02:46:10,040
So my daughter has to step up and

3864
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:11,490
do that.
And it's,

3865
02:46:11,570 --> 02:46:12,690
it's an incredible thing.
It's,

3866
02:46:12,720 --> 02:46:14,990
it's,
it's incredibly powerful and empowering.

3867
02:46:15,260 --> 02:46:17,100
Even I watched her change,
you know,

3868
02:46:17,110 --> 02:46:22,110
and when she would be intimidated by in 
those situations to where now she's 

3869
02:46:22,110 --> 02:46:22,110
like,
bring it,

3870
02:46:22,110 --> 02:46:22,910
bring it.
I got something for you.

3871
02:46:26,440 --> 02:46:27,790
That's awesome man.
Um,

3872
02:46:27,890 --> 02:46:32,890
we were almost three hours in here.
So anything else that you've got a 

3873
02:46:32,890 --> 02:46:32,890
whole,
this,

3874
02:46:32,890 --> 02:46:34,190
you're the only guys ever showed up,
I think with this many notes.

3875
02:46:34,250 --> 02:46:34,720
Yeah.
Well,

3876
02:46:34,730 --> 02:46:37,310
so what I want to do is now if we can 
spend the next four hours going through,

3877
02:46:37,860 --> 02:46:38,860
we,
we hit it,

3878
02:46:38,870 --> 02:46:40,940
we hit all kinds of stuff.
Yeah.

3879
02:46:41,240 --> 02:46:45,740
I was driving up here taking notes on a,
on the Jordan Peterson podcast.

3880
02:46:45,741 --> 02:46:47,150
I think that everyone should listen to.
That's a great,

3881
02:46:47,180 --> 02:46:52,180
great podcast to listen to and there's 
so many points that he covers in there 

3882
02:46:52,180 --> 02:46:54,350
that are really profound and I think 
important important today,

3883
02:46:54,410 --> 02:46:59,410
but he's dealing with a very unusual 
situation where those coddled soft kids 

3884
02:46:59,410 --> 02:47:04,300
are now in universities and they're 
trying to run the show with these 

3885
02:47:04,300 --> 02:47:06,980
ridiculous programs of inclusion and 
diversity and you know,

3886
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:09,470
forcing their mindset down everybody 
else's throat.

3887
02:47:09,470 --> 02:47:13,550
It's really fascinating.
It's a fascinating and disturbing to see

3888
02:47:13,551 --> 02:47:15,920
all that happening and it's really.
Yeah,

3889
02:47:15,921 --> 02:47:16,210
it's,
it's,

3890
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:21,240
it's actually disturbing to see that 
happening and see kids could be focused 

3891
02:47:21,381 --> 02:47:26,381
on such important things in the world 
and they ended up focusing on something 

3892
02:47:26,381 --> 02:47:29,810
that is borderline in many cases,
borderline,

3893
02:47:29,950 --> 02:47:31,280
you know,
meaningless.

3894
02:47:31,490 --> 02:47:32,500
You know,
launch,

3895
02:47:32,590 --> 02:47:34,550
let's,
let's move towards a real goal.

3896
02:47:34,610 --> 02:47:39,260
There's diseases to cure and you know,
good things to do in the world.

3897
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:40,460
Well,
you know,

3898
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:44,510
I think everybody agrees that racism is 
bad and homophobia is bad,

3899
02:47:44,511 --> 02:47:49,511
but that's not exactly what you're 
dealing with here we're dealing with is 

3900
02:47:49,511 --> 02:47:52,061
people trying to control the way other 
people behave and talk and think and it 

3901
02:47:52,061 --> 02:47:56,440
might not even be in response to any 
actual real like negative things that 

3902
02:47:59,181 --> 02:48:00,890
have happened.
It's like they're trying.

3903
02:48:00,891 --> 02:48:04,400
They're trying to create negative things
to battle that might not even be there.

3904
02:48:04,790 --> 02:48:09,790
It's just a lot of weirdness today in 
this world and I think that to bring it 

3905
02:48:09,790 --> 02:48:14,261
back full circle,
a lot of this weirdness comes from a 

3906
02:48:14,261 --> 02:48:14,261
lack of true struggle.
Like,

3907
02:48:14,261 --> 02:48:15,650
do you think That these kids that are 
growing up in Russia,

3908
02:48:15,651 --> 02:48:17,840
they're doing back flips off of the top 
of buildings?

3909
02:48:18,410 --> 02:48:21,330
Are they dealing with the same like,
uh,

3910
02:48:21,340 --> 02:48:24,170
you know,
diversity lectures and classes that they

3911
02:48:24,171 --> 02:48:25,370
have to handle it.
I think there's an,

3912
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:30,520
there's an intrinsic part of human 
beings that wants to be part of a tribe 

3913
02:48:30,520 --> 02:48:31,400
of some kind and wants to defend their 
tribe.

3914
02:48:31,610 --> 02:48:34,350
And when you grow up in a place where 
there's no real try,

3915
02:48:34,351 --> 02:48:37,160
but then you look for one to latch onto 
and these people over here,

3916
02:48:37,161 --> 02:48:42,161
they have a cause and they've got a 
tribe and you can be part of that tribe 

3917
02:48:42,161 --> 02:48:45,191
and you can be.
And then you can lash out at the bad 

3918
02:48:45,191 --> 02:48:45,320
guys.
And I think that happens a lot.

3919
02:48:45,321 --> 02:48:50,321
And I Think it's a,
it's unfortunately unfortunate because 

3920
02:48:50,321 --> 02:48:50,340
it really crushes,
you know,

3921
02:48:50,390 --> 02:48:52,370
individuality,
which is what I,

3922
02:48:52,371 --> 02:48:54,680
you know,
that's my kind of my premier base,

3923
02:48:54,820 --> 02:48:59,820
you know,
faults are around individual freedom to 

3924
02:48:59,820 --> 02:49:00,920
be an individual thing for yourself,
for your mind.

3925
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:03,650
Yeah.
There's a lot of comfort in those groups

3926
02:49:03,651 --> 02:49:05,840
that these people belong to.
Whether it's,

3927
02:49:05,841 --> 02:49:06,800
You know,
any kind of group,

3928
02:49:06,801 --> 02:49:08,190
whether it's a hardcore right wing

3929
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:10,920
group or a hardcore left ring group you 
get in,

3930
02:49:10,950 --> 02:49:14,340
you kind of know what the rules are and 
you play by those rules.

3931
02:49:14,341 --> 02:49:19,341
And then you surround yourself with a 
bunch of likeminded people and an echo 

3932
02:49:19,341 --> 02:49:21,900
chamber who also support the fact that 
these rules are the rules and we have to

3933
02:49:21,901 --> 02:49:23,010
get these out there.
And like,

3934
02:49:23,440 --> 02:49:28,440
we,
I think we just need to establish 

3935
02:49:28,440 --> 02:49:28,440
there's a bunch of shit you shouldn't 
do.

3936
02:49:28,440 --> 02:49:28,440
Don't steal from people,
don't rape anybody,

3937
02:49:28,440 --> 02:49:29,100
don't,
you know,

3938
02:49:29,110 --> 02:49:34,110
don't shoot anybody,
like figure out a way we can 

3939
02:49:34,110 --> 02:49:34,980
harmoniously get along together without 
fucking with each other,

3940
02:49:35,220 --> 02:49:40,220
you know,
and then just let everybody be whatever 

3941
02:49:40,220 --> 02:49:40,220
they are.
If you're gay,

3942
02:49:40,220 --> 02:49:41,130
you're gay,
if you like listening to classical music

3943
02:49:41,131 --> 02:49:43,200
and,
and running naked through the streets,

3944
02:49:43,290 --> 02:49:45,060
I don't care.
It's still fuck me,

3945
02:49:45,360 --> 02:49:46,050
just don't,
You know,

3946
02:49:46,051 --> 02:49:47,940
don't cause trouble,
don't you know.

3947
02:49:48,060 --> 02:49:48,830
And again,
that's just,

3948
02:49:48,900 --> 02:49:51,010
you're talking about individual freedom.
Be yourself,

3949
02:49:51,070 --> 02:49:52,760
man.
You know what's,

3950
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:54,900
which is what I like individual freedom 
to do what you want to do.

3951
02:49:54,960 --> 02:49:57,960
Hard for insecure people to allow that 
to happen.

3952
02:49:57,961 --> 02:50:02,961
Because in insecure people,
when they see individual freedom that's 

3953
02:50:02,961 --> 02:50:05,180
contrary to what their own personal 
behaviors,

3954
02:50:05,190 --> 02:50:08,650
like they have to question themselves 
and challenge themselves.

3955
02:50:08,651 --> 02:50:12,390
So they decided that that person's wrong
and these people are wrong and I'm right

3956
02:50:12,391 --> 02:50:17,391
and this and this needs to be 
established and we need to fight and we 

3957
02:50:17,391 --> 02:50:20,121
need to go out and punch nazis or 
whatever the fuck they think they're 

3958
02:50:20,121 --> 02:50:21,360
supposed to be doing.
And it just gets real weird man.

3959
02:50:21,930 --> 02:50:26,580
It's weird than when that becomes your 
whole life and I'm sure you get this.

3960
02:50:26,581 --> 02:50:31,581
I get it a lot,
which is people on social media that 

3961
02:50:31,581 --> 02:50:33,870
want me to weigh in on this thing or 
they want me to weigh in on this side or

3962
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:36,510
they're attacking me because of this or 
they're attacking me because of that.

3963
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:39,600
Not so much attacking,
but people want me to weigh in on things

3964
02:50:39,690 --> 02:50:41,730
all the time and it's things that I just
say,

3965
02:50:41,760 --> 02:50:45,540
man,
this isn't affecting me.

3966
02:50:45,970 --> 02:50:47,370
And,
and not only that,

3967
02:50:47,371 --> 02:50:49,740
my comments aren't goIng to move this 
forward.

3968
02:50:49,920 --> 02:50:53,370
And finally I don't care about that 
thing.

3969
02:50:53,550 --> 02:50:56,070
I understand that you're obsessed with 
it,

3970
02:50:56,340 --> 02:50:58,080
but I'm not,
I don't.

3971
02:50:58,350 --> 02:51:01,020
I'm not obsessed with this thing that 
you're obsessed with,

3972
02:51:01,350 --> 02:51:03,060
so I don't even care that you're 
obsessed with it.

3973
02:51:03,061 --> 02:51:04,550
That's cool.
And when people asked me,

3974
02:51:04,850 --> 02:51:05,490
hey,
sounds good,

3975
02:51:06,120 --> 02:51:07,180
sounds good,
go keep,

3976
02:51:07,220 --> 02:51:08,700
keep,
keep doing what you're doing.

3977
02:51:08,701 --> 02:51:10,680
Sounds great.
Not not my thing.

3978
02:51:10,950 --> 02:51:15,950
Move on.
People get obsessed with things that 

3979
02:51:15,950 --> 02:51:15,950
they won't even be obsessed with a few 
years later,

3980
02:51:15,950 --> 02:51:15,950
like,
hey man,

3981
02:51:15,990 --> 02:51:18,150
I got obsessed about that thing that you
are obsessed with.

3982
02:51:18,151 --> 02:51:19,130
And now I'm like,
you know,

3983
02:51:19,140 --> 02:51:24,140
man,
I'm not even obsessed about that 

3984
02:51:24,140 --> 02:51:24,140
anymore.

3985
02:51:24,140 --> 02:51:26,120
I'm onto some new shit.
Go get obsessed with kettlebells in 

3986
02:51:26,120 --> 02:51:26,490
jujitsu.
You start that out.

3987
02:51:26,790 --> 02:51:31,790
Get obsessed with life improvement.
Find things that you enjoy doing that 

3988
02:51:31,790 --> 02:51:32,230
are difficult.
Do them and get better at them.

3989
02:51:32,310 --> 02:51:35,430
It seems so simplistic.
It seems like a ridiculous,

3990
02:51:35,431 --> 02:51:37,890
idealistic point of view,
but it's effective.

3991
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:43,280
you will be happier and you will be a 
more positive influence on everyone 

3992
02:51:43,280 --> 02:51:43,920
around you.
Yeah,

3993
02:51:44,070 --> 02:51:45,360
for sure.
Be nice to people.

3994
02:51:45,720 --> 02:51:48,300
Not so hard.
Jocko willink.

3995
02:51:48,301 --> 02:51:49,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
uh,

3996
02:51:50,100 --> 02:51:52,080

podcasts.

3997
02:51:52,860 --> 02:51:55,170

podcast.

3999
02:51:59,130 --> 02:52:02,190
Old book is called extreme ownership.
You can get those everywhere.

4000
02:52:02,191 --> 02:52:03,870

02:52:03,930 --> 02:52:05,680
