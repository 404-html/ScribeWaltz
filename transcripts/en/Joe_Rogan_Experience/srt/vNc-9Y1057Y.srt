1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,500
And four and three and two and one.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,930
Oh,
what a way to lead the show there.

3
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:10,850
Joe Rogan.
I like to do it that way.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,340
I don't know why I've been talking to 
you like that forever,

5
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:16,600
but I know you will always go into these
Irish accents.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,100
They would throw us out of Ireland with 
those exit.

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,330
I think it was when you started touring 
in Ireland on a regular basis.

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,550
That's a long time Joe.
Yeah.

9
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:27,740
But you,
you've always been touring in Ireland.

10
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:30,800
I remember you talked about how great 
Ireland was decades ago.

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

12
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:32,834
You've always loved it there under the 
kilkenny festival more than any other 

13
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:35,690
white guy?
No,

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,320
I'm an American.
And how long have you been there?

15
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:44,321
How many times since like 22.
Holy Shit ritual or also in a lot,

16
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:46,160
but he's.
He's based in London.

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,110
I'm the only one that actually still 
comes over rich hall for him.

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,950
He did this niglet on Saturday night.

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,560
Live is based in London now.
Yeah,

20
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,190
he likes it better there.
You know,

21
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,460
he still works here once in a while.
He's got a place in Montana,

22
00:00:58,461 --> 00:00:59,294
but he was on Saturday night live and he
did that snake gluts book and it was a 

23
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:02,714
big smash.
I paid to see him live when I was one 

24
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:09,350
week in the comedy.
He was performing it stitches and I went

25
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:10,310
there to live,
to sit.

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,440
Oh,
in Boston?

27
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,283
Yeah.
So he lives in London now because he's 

28
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:15,260
still doing stand up.
Yeah.

29
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:16,370
Yeah.
I saw them at the,

30
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,650
uh,
factory in Vegas a couple weeks ago.

31
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:19,730
Him,
Harris,

32
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:22,630
Pete and Blake Clark,
he always used Harris Pete,

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,290
like he would take care of on the road 
with them.

34
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,540
And Harris Peter used to watch is 
Montana place for them.

35
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,290
Right.
That's hilarious.

36
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,330
It was a joyless doorman,
like he made the comedy experience tents

37
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:34,160
and miserable,
but that's pretty funny.

38
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,890
He was,
he was rough as a doorman Harris's,

39
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,190
but he's one of those old staples of the
comedy store,

40
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:42,260
which is almost kind of weird not having
them around.

41
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,273
Yeah.
Yeah.

42
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,160
I mean he made it so uninviting,
you know,

43
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,130
just have a smile show to people,
you know,

44
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:51,530
they're going to have a good time.
He made it like a military thing.

45
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah,
it wasn't good.

46
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,043
Yeah.
And then there was truly who was always 

47
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,783
the guy who was sort of working or 
anything you needed from Julie 

48
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,240
allegedly,
you know,

49
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,093
he played,
he played guitar at the House of Blues 

50
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,003
Across the street and he was really good
years with this group and I was taking 

51
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,150
30 feet away.
You're like a Schlub who's like,

52
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,430
you know,
running around trying to,

53
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,000
trying to sell,
you know,

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,330
coke or whatever he was doing.
And here you're like a big store.

55
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,380
Like it's so close.

56
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,560
It's so far.
You know,

57
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,700
he used to headline at the House of 
Blues.

58
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:28,220
We would all go over and see him and he 
was fucking good man.

59
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:28,940
Very good.
Yeah.

60
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,260
His band.
Where's he at?

61
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,020
I don't know.
Wow.

62
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,290
I've been seeing me years.
You haven't seen that guy.

63
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,120
And literally forever.
Well,

64
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:38,954
this whole renaissance to the comedy 
store has happened since you came back 

65
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,590
and the guys and they started filtering 
back,

66
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:48,710
build burned and Crystal Leo came in,
you know,

67
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:49,544
but it's been.
When he was here there was some slow 

68
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:51,674
nights,
man.

69
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,170
Oh yeah.
You know what you know,

70
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,103
you know the place is slow.
When polio and I are the most famous 

71
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:58,310
people,
it's not a good sign.

72
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,120
I'm not myself down,
but let's face it,

73
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,190
you need a little more than the two of 
us.

74
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,600
Yeah,
it's weird there now,

75
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,463
isn't it?
You go there now it's like it's mom to 

76
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,340
contact through the hallways.

77
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,260
It's incredible.
I mean you,

78
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,880
you always think what's going on.
It's nothing.

79
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:13,714
It's just a regular night,
but you'll have something in the main 

80
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:18,790
room or a Sam Tripoli or that's 
incredible.

81
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,010
Tuesday night main room told that was 
unheard of.

82
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,910
Yeah.
Tuesday night.

83
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:26,500
Main rooms sold out while the or sold 
out while the belly room and sold out on

84
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,580
Tuesday night.
It's crazy.

85
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,830
It's good though.
It's great for us.

86
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:30,910
It's fun.
Yeah.

87
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,080
Well I love the crowds.
I mean I really get something out.

88
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,520
It will three clubs.
I really do like factories,

89
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,260
like college kids and,
and foreign students and foreign foreign

90
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:44,440
people.
And the comedy store to me is the most,

91
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,303
uh,
cross pollinated lake in the sense that 

92
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,910
there's so many more tourists because of
the hotels.

93
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:49,744
You know,
the Improv was kind of like Hollywood 

94
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:53,110
slick.
Yeah.

95
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,420
Yeah.
And then there's the Improv lab,

96
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:56,950
which I just can't get a read on.

97
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,950
I've done it a couple times just for the
challenge and men,

98
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,173
they sit there and then we'll all of a 
sudden they laugh at like scares you 

99
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,940
because they were sitting there that was
quiet and then they weird little room.

100
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,810
Yeah.
They're very discerning,

101
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:11,181
you know,
that.

102
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:12,014
That's like the hip spot there.
The thing is that room used to be a 

103
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,570
great room when it was set up.
The other one,

104
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:20,560
I liked it the other way to away it was 
amazing when it was the whole bar area.

105
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

106
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,770
Well,
you know,

107
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:24,860
uh,
I just.

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,090
And the thing is,
I don't know if you go,

109
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,410
you don't do the multiple shows.
Oh yeah.

110
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:32,280
You do them all at the store.
I do some of,

111
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:34,660
um,
some nights I'll do the Improv,

112
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:38,050
then I'll jet over to the store too.
I don't really do the factory anymore,

113
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,550
but if I can do it,
if I do an early show at the store,

114
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:44,390
sometimes they'll do the ice house as 
well.

115
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,330
But you'll do benefits there once in a 
while.

116
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,830
Yeah.
That's the way build.

117
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,400
Build those,
uh,

118
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,001
two,
it's like,

119
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,770
you know,
whatever makes you happy.

120
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:51,790
You know,
we've talked about this.

121
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,720
It's like,
wow,

122
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,953
I just loved the idea and I know you do 
you have a thought and you can go on 

123
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,490
that night.
Yeah.

124
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,410
You know what I mean?
What I imagined,

125
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,340
like an actor can't do that.
No,

126
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:04,174
it's giant too because sometimes that 
thought is funny to you right there in 

127
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:07,534
that moment.
You know why it's funny to you and you 

128
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:11,380
might forget why it's funny.
The next day it might have like a little

129
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:13,290
Napkin with something written down,
you know,

130
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,860
a tampons,
Kleenex,

131
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,810
paper towels.
Well,

132
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:21,811
I don't carry tampons anymore anymore 
because my rectal bleeding and on when I

133
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,633
started,
I don't think that's the way to go with 

134
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:26,290
rectal bleeding.
I think there's other options,

135
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,313
I think.

136
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,430
Did you ever get the colonoscopy?
No.

137
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,780
Colonoscopy,
right?

138
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,890
Yeah.
Anyway,

139
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:35,560
people ask saying something that goes 
funny.

140
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:37,780
I said,
I don't think these college kids want to

141
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,230
hear about that.
No,

142
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,370
it's not the kind of subject I would 
bring up,

143
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,730
but it's bad enough.
I'm older than them.

144
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:45,010
I don't want to bring up stuff that 
hasn't happened to them yet.

145
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,730
Yes.
Stuff that they don't really.

146
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,700
They're never going to understand like 
Alzheimer's.

147
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:50,830
Hey kids,
you know what about Alzheimer's disease,

148
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:52,570
right?
Disease.

149
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:56,710
I can't remember the Jamie.
We were talking.

150
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,330
I was telling them the power of this 
podcast,

151
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,710
not the stroke.
You be,

152
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,360
you know,
you know how strong it is.

153
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,194
When I went to Australia doesn't not 
even think of all these boys were there 

154
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,140
and they were like,
busted my chops about not knowing.

155
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:09,974
How do you remember?
We did a thing about how much does the 

156
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:12,254
gorilla way you were much closer than I 
was and they were busted my balls about 

157
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:16,814
not knowing him.

158
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,900
Rogan beat you on that one.
You know that funny can Australia.

159
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,000
Of course it's about wildlife over 
there.

160
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,310
I got a buddy,
my buddy Adam Green trees,

161
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,144
always trying to get me to come over to 
Australia and every time I find 

162
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,720
something online that can kill you from 
Australia,

163
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,573
San Antonio,
like,

164
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,990
fuck you.
Yeah,

165
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:35,600
but you never see that stuff.
You got to go to the outback for that.

166
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,920
Well,
that's what he wants to take me.

167
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,190
Like what are you,
why would you want to go there?

168
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:39,580
And you might as well just go to the 
hobby.

169
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,920
I'm hunting.
It's a lot of bowhunting and Australia.

170
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,120
Bowhunting.
Bow.

171
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,440
Oh,
like archery.

172
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,230
Oh my.
Can you do that in Australia?

173
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,060
No.
Can you do it here?

174
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,893
You.
Are you good with a bow and Arrow for 

175
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,244
real?
Yeah,

176
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,430
that's where I got that.
Wow.

177
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,030
I didn't know.
I bonded.

178
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,423
Can't believe I never told you that.
For years I've seen pictures of you and 

179
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,260
Brian,
a hunting,

180
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,830
hunting bear and stuff with rifles.
Is that with rifles?

181
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,410
You have any idea how much more of a 
manual or than I am?

182
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,570
I'm not thinking about it that often,
but I never.

183
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:16,220
I mean I don't hunt.
I don't do anything.

184
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:19,790
To me it's like a big deal to have 
somebody drive me to vegas.

185
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,900
I feel like an adventure.
I don't think it has anything to do with

186
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,760
being a man.
Well,

187
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,370
just think you,
uh,

188
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,253
you don't have the same interest as me.
That's the beautiful thing about 

189
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:30,884
America.
Where do whatever the thing you want to 

190
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,130
thank you for telling me,
but at the country that we love,

191
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:36,110
but I just don't.
I don't know.

192
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:39,200
I mean the whole idea of sleeping in the
woods and all.

193
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,240
It's fun.
I enjoy it.

194
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,710
I enjoy five star hotels.
I enjoy those 24 hour room service.

195
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,850
I like that as well.
That's nice too.

196
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,980
I like that as well,
but I do like getting up,

197
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,023
open up the tent,
looking out and just seeing a mountain 

198
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,300
filled with trees and hearing the birds 
Chirp and put your boots on.

199
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,840
Happen to a cup of coffee that's warmed 
up by a fire.

200
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,200
I love all that.
Must be very funny with you and Kaolin.

201
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,643
Kaolin is one of the funniest guys.
It's amber lived when it comes to like 

202
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,220
just hanging out here bullshitting.
Definitely with a small group of people.

203
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,900
You did a time ever zenergy and he just,
he knows how to make shit laugh.

204
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,173
We did this hunt in Montana in 2012.
It was like six or seven days in the 

205
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:25,280
Missouri breaks,
which is like a very,

206
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,280
really a real wild place.

207
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,680
You don't see any people.
There's no cell phone signals and it was

208
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,514
six solid days of gay jokes.
Kona Cowan and I mean gay jokes like 

209
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:36,734
Callan being gay with us,
like wanting to with us are wanting us 

210
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,270
to have sex with him and,
and just.

211
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,330
It never stopped being funny.
He's fucking hilarious.

212
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:47,620
It's now you get all this down.
You just said anybody covered.

213
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,960
Showed some days.
Yeah.

214
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:53,400
That was for a show that was for a show 
called meat eater.

215
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,850
It's say it's a hunting show that my 
friend Steve Rinella has.

216
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,580
And um,
we've done that show three times,

217
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,260
four,
four times we've done that show for dms.

218
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,440
Does your wife and going on these trips 
like,

219
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,720
no,
she likes it and the meat is amazing,

220
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,673
you know,
come back with wild game hunting and 

221
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,600
killing some.
And then eaten it,

222
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,940
so just eaten meat right there.
But the chicken.

223
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,640
Yeah.
But I don't think of it as like a course

224
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,533
because it didn't kill it.
And then do you ever think of like 

225
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:24,564
Salami as being part of an animal?
To me it's just this little thing that 

226
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:30,870
runs around the cut its legs off and 
make a sandwich.

227
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,980
Well I think about it that way now I 
think about it as meat,

228
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,420
but yeah,
I always just thought about it.

229
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:37,740
Islam,
it's very convenient.

230
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,650
It's very convenient to think about 
things that way.

231
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,320
And you lose that convenience when you 
hunt,

232
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,730
you get a weird connection with your 
food that um,

233
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,370
some people just don't want.
And I understand that too,

234
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,410
that some people just wanna be able to 
go to the grocery store,

235
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,950
pick up a little styrofoam container 
that has a stake in it,

236
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,910
take it home,
Cook it,

237
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:58,290
and they're good and they're fine with 
that.

238
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,053
That's fine too.
So you've killed stuff and eating it 

239
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:02,274
there.
I've killed stuff and eating it in the 

240
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:07,110
woods or eating part of it obviously.
And then you freeze it.

241
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

242
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,830
Bring it home and phrase it.
When did you start this,

243
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,000
Joe?
Two thousand 12,

244
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,120
so six years ago.
More like five and a half.

245
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,720
And it was a a crossbow or what?
Do you know?

246
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,870
A compound bow looks like a regular 
bulb.

247
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,704
It has wheels at the top that are called
cams and then the cams when it turns 

248
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:31,020
over,
gives you the mechanical advantage.

249
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:33,640
It makes them more powerful.
Good.

250
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,060
It's cool.
It's intense.

251
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,610
I like to cross bows,
but yeah,

252
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:41,940
those are good,
but it's really just like a shitty gun.

253
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,043
That's the crossbow is to.
Could just shooting a stick instead of 

254
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:46,261
like you're,
you know,

255
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:49,570
you can rest it and looked through the 
like you can put it on a rest.

256
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,010
Actually look through the scope and then
squeeze the trigger like a rifle.

257
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,620
It's not nearly as difficult as a 
regular po.

258
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,720
Do you ever shoot an animal?
Hit it,

259
00:10:57,721 --> 00:11:00,510
and then it ran away?
Unfortunately,

260
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:02,970
yes.
I did that on TV.

261
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,830
I did the mediator show.
Yeah.

262
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,360
There was a problem with the rifle.
The rifle scope was off.

263
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,553
I'd fallen and the rifle,
the rifle scope was installed by one of 

264
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:16,140
the guys.
As we got there,

265
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,393
we changed the scopes because there was 
a sponsor of the company sponsor of the 

266
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:21,414
show rather,
and they put a different rifle scope on 

267
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,400
and a shot a deer with it and it was 
wounded and it was.

268
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,290
It didn't die.
That's kind of suck.

269
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,370
It was horrible.
I mean,

270
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:32,460
I'm sure it.
Sure it died within a couple of hours,

271
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:34,890
but we couldn't get to it in time.
Who couldn't find it?

272
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,390
I'd rather just hit it with a car.
Well,

273
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,390
that's one of the problems were where we
were in Wisconsin at nighttime.

274
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:43,920
You gotta drive slow.
Oh yeah.

275
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,803
They're fucking everywhere.
They're darting out into the middle of 

276
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:48,060
the road.
Especially when it's called.

277
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:53,090
The rut kicks in.
Red is the deal to get one.

278
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,310
That's what I was thinking.
Yeah.

279
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,600
Yeah.
They run,

280
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,700
they run around,
they get fucking crazy.

281
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,390
They get so crazy.
They'll just walk right into traffic and

282
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:03,400
just stare at cars.
I'll fuck anything.

283
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,160
I don't know what's coming at me.
I mean there's,

284
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:11,050
there's videos of Moose trying to fuck 
bales of hay during the Rut,

285
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,110
like they literally lose their mind.
They have no idea what's going on.

286
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,520
They were like nine feet are gigantic.
A good size Mousse.

287
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:22,270
Like a good size.
Canadian Moose could be 1800 pounds.

288
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,340
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

289
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,440
You can't even imagine how.

290
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,470
Yeah,
let's try one of those.

291
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,860
One of the other room.
You have Moose Burgers?

292
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:30,760
Yeah,
yeah,

293
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,200
yeah.
I've gotten loose burgers series.

294
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,540
Yeah,
I've got some leftover.

295
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,220
Yeah.
I got a lot of elk burger.

296
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,070
That's an elk that big on the wall back 
there.

297
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,890
They're delicious.
So good for you too.

298
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,230
It's like the best meat you can never.
Oh yeah.

299
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,670
It's.
He doesn't even look the same.

300
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,010
It looks like a deep,
dark red.

301
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
I don't know how a psychological.
It's obviously like a logical,

302
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,163
but it's certain meats like rabbit I 
can't eat and I don't know why because 

303
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:56,770
I'll eat chicken,
but it doesn't really make sense.

304
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,080
Are you a bugs bunny fan?
Yeah.

305
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,050
Big Hardcore hardcore.
Get the tattoo.

306
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,120
Yeah,
but I don't want to talk about it.

307
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,390
Can we talk about the slope,
the airplane to best thing.

308
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,410
I know,
I know.

309
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,383
Yeah.
A lot of people get real attached to 

310
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:12,760
rabbits,
but chickens are like,

311
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,380
they're heartless little dinosaurs.

312
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,710
They're noisy and.
Yeah.

313
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,940
Yeah.
Um,

314
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,540
chickens there are,
you know,

315
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,990
basically a lizard.
The lizard with feathers.

316
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,400
Really?
Yeah.

317
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,073
Yeah.
He pluck all that shit off and look at 

318
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:30,191
them.
Like,

319
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:33,070
what is that?
What's a bird flying lizard?

320
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,680
Not a good looking animal.
So they know whether or not Tara Dac.

321
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,930
I just found out from my seven year old 
the Tara doctors are not dinosaurs.

322
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,600
Really?
Yeah.

323
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,560
She corrected.
They came in a different period.

324
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,603
Oh No.
She told me to not dinosaurs and we 

325
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:49,270
googled it and she was right when I was 
like,

326
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,550
how am I so stupid.
Then I was thinking,

327
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:53,050
you know,
we always had those images,

328
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:55,030
a Tara Dactyl,
so where they were flying around,

329
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:56,590
they had like,
like wings,

330
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,300
right.
We've got Jamie,

331
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,980
you got something for me.
That's what it says.

332
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:01,480
It says that they lived at the same 
time,

333
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:04,810
but they're not actually dinosaur the 
dinosaur technically.

334
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,600
Good question.
Somehow they are not actually dinosaurs.

335
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:08,434
They were flying creatures and 
paleontologist keep telling us the 

336
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:13,150
dinosaurs are birds,
so the dye,

337
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,350
what?
Wait a minute,

338
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,023
the petro source,
but that doesn't make any sense because 

339
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:20,950
dinosaurs are birds,
so birds became dinosaurs,

340
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,200
but Tara dactyl who could fly or not 
dinosaurs wasn't the bird.

341
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:29,410
The the closest descendant of dinosaurs?
Yes.

342
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,720
Yeah.
They're not done in source.

343
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:33,250
So what the hell are they?
Here's the thing,

344
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,084
like when they showed that image of them
with the skin for wings instead of a 

345
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,453
bat,
I don't know if they know if that's 

346
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:41,584
real.
I don't know if that's based on what 

347
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:45,904
they absolutely know or like what they 
think because they're starting to think 

348
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:53,450
that a lot of dinosaurs had feathers.
Now this is pretty recently I was in the

349
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:57,410
museum in Bozeman,
Montana.

350
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:58,244
There's a museum,
like a natural history type museum and 

351
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:03,980
they have like a split image of a 
dinosaur,

352
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,260
like a raptor,
and it's covered with feathers.

353
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,310
Wow,
man.

354
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:08,144
Because they think it's entirely 
possible that a lot of the dinosaurs 

355
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,870
were covered in feathers,
but I didn't know.

356
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,280
Not as much fossilized remains of it.
I didn't know that.

357
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,760
Men never lived with dinosaurs.
Period.

358
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:20,594
Yeah.
I didn't know that until a couple of 

359
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,520
years ago.
You really didn't know.

360
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,593
I thought cavemen Mino [inaudible].
They always show them like I always go 

361
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,410
by the flintstones.

362
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,550
You really didn't know.
Well,

363
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:32,384
I mean you're a real comic dom.
I guess you don't pay attention to shit 

364
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,980
outside.
It's all in jokes like God,

365
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,670
I can do that decently well.
I've had no skills.

366
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,003
I like to teach kids I liked.
I liked teaching fourth grade and that 

367
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:49,700
was about it.
But you like having fun?

368
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,541
Well,
if you teach kids,

369
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,940
don't teach them about dinosaurs.
What did you teach?

370
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,303
I paleontology everything.
I taught everything because it was 

371
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:57,554
Catholic school.
I taught everything but the but the 

372
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:00,134
smart kids math because I was dumb.
I just stuck with the dumb kids and 

373
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,130
split the class could come on and you 
retards come with me.

374
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,850
Which he couldn't say no.
Yeah,

375
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,880
you couldn't say that.
Now you get in serious trouble.

376
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:12,680
You'd be on the front page.
USA Today.

377
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,240
You know,
I still have kids that get in touch with

378
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:14,630
me.

379
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,463
Really?
Yeah.

380
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,740
They said that.
It makes me feel so good that it was the

381
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,680
best year of their lives as far as going
to school because I really,

382
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,720
we had fucking fun.
I would go in my speech was I want to go

383
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:27,554
to the gym more than you guys do,
so don't mess it up for me and you got 

384
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,900
to learn some of this stuff.
I don't know why I hate it too,

385
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,660
you know,
like be like kind of honest.

386
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,240
And they dug it and we had just,
we had dance contest and everything.

387
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,050
It was hilarious.
I had this one kid,

388
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:44,450
tyrone done.
He was like a baby James Brown.

389
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,793
He could do a split or complete split 
and then then get his self up without 

390
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:51,650
touching anything.
Wow.

391
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,550
Yeah.
Amazing.

392
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,290
Like James Brown.
Yeah.

393
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,240
Wow.
Yeah.

394
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:57,074
Well,
when you're a kid and you're going to 

395
00:16:57,861 --> 00:17:01,190
school like anyone who was any spark of 
life is exciting.

396
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,593
I still to this day,
think about some of the teachers that I 

397
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:05,174
had in high school.
I had two really good teachers in high 

398
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:07,250
school.
One Lady,

399
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,273
I wish I could remember her name and one
guy who was a Spanish teacher that I'm 

400
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,640
pretty sure,
fuck,

401
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,660
one of my friends who was a girl,
she thanks for clearing that up.

402
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,560
He was a young guy.
He was like 25 years old and she was hot

403
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,293
and uh,
I know that they were like talking 

404
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:29,360
lunch.
She was 17.

405
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:31,140
He was 25.
I'm pretty sure he fucked her.

406
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,173
I'm almost positive she was very 
sexually aggressive and she was at 

407
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,630
advanced for her time both physically 
and mentally.

408
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,583
Like she was one of those girls,
like you knew she was not going to last 

409
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:45,884
in that town.
She's going to get the fuck out of 

410
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:49,950
there.
I remember I did this clean show at the,

411
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:52,530
uh,
that hotel in San Diego.

412
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,120
The uh,
what was with some,

413
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:56,820
like it hot was.
It's a clean check del Coronado.

414
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,710
Uh,
I did a clean show,

415
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,720
like an early show at 7:00 on a 
Saturday.

416
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,460
They make you be clean.
Oh,

417
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:04,460
they can only make it be so clean.
But the point,

418
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,040
the thing I was getting at was a 15 year
old boys.

419
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,960
They're right,
and they were with their parents.

420
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:11,670
They could tell their parents for a 
little snooty,

421
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,470
so I said 15,
what a great age and this,

422
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,650
this is good.
This can be a dangerous thing to say.

423
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:18,720
I said,
you know what's great about being 15?

424
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,500
You can nail a 15 year old girl and not 
go to jail for the rest of your life.

425
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,870
And the kids were crying,
laughing,

426
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,983
and the parents were really.
They looked like they wanted to pull 

427
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:32,370
them out of there.
Oh yeah.

428
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,240
Parents don't want kids.
Fucking hilarious.

429
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,690
Well up there both fists.
15,

430
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,220
you really can't get in trouble.
Well,

431
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,220
the girl could get pregnant.
That's no Bueno.

432
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,560
But like the idea that going to stop 
them like,

433
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:46,820
Hey,
you stopped doing that thing.

434
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:51,821
That feels better than anything ever 
going to do at school at work.

435
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,653
Don't do that though.
Your all of your cells in your body are 

436
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,330
compelling you in that direction,
but don't do it,

437
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:01,190
but don't do it.
Your whole body,

438
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:03,110
your Dna,
your thoughts are haunted.

439
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:08,410
Everything is wrapped around like ass 
and legs and feet and miles and don't do

440
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:16,180
it.
I remember the first time I worked up in

441
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:21,181
my bedroom in philly and I came so much 
that I thought I'll never have children.

442
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,170
I really did.
I thought I.

443
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,440
I swear to you,
I thought I emptied it.

444
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,290
Take train.
It just kept coming.

445
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,740
Float Gushes in.
Amazing.

446
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:37,340
How far you would shoot back then to the
distance was insane.

447
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,550
Knock your eye out from.
We googled it and we think.

448
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:44,000
I think if I remember correctly,
the furthest that guy ever just was like

449
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:45,830
29 feet.
Holy Shit.

450
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,310
I can't even throw it that floor.
I don't remember making that search.

451
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,090
You blocked it out of your mind,
your memory,

452
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:56,690
like a childhood molestation.
There was this guy,

453
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:58,650
Liddy Schultz.
I remember crazy legs.

454
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,700
He used to do a bit of a jerk and he 
goes,

455
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,520
I jerk off the midget and he would come 
in here and then I went bad.

456
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:05,690
It's come onto the crowd.

457
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,920
No crazy land.
What do you say to that?

458
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:10,330
Go.
Good.

459
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,420
Good.
I see you're writing.

460
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,283
Always writing.
He used to fucking walk on stage with a 

461
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:18,290
smokey the bear doll and he would.
He would hold the dollar up and say,

462
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,170
only you can prevent forest fires,
and he goes,

463
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,380
shut the fuck up and punches me.
Kenny said you were crying,

464
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:28,844
laughing.
He was one of those guys that was just 

465
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,813
fucking funny.
From the look on his face to everything 

466
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:36,380
he said.
He just knew how to.

467
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,850
He was his own unique style.
You just knew how to be funny.

468
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,050
Well,
he had that psychotic.

469
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,003
Funny too.
Like he looked like a guy who would 

470
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,590
pettit pigeon go,
yes,

471
00:20:45,591 --> 00:20:46,424
sure.
Daddy loves you and the now what did I 

472
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:50,990
do exactly what?
They loved you crazy.

473
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,470
And then chuck it aside and moving on 
with his act.

474
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,300
He grabs the pen only you can prevent 
forest fires.

475
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,840
Shut the fuck up punches.

476
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,440
We remember Jimbos place in Montreal.
Yeah,

477
00:21:07,441 --> 00:21:09,070
of course.
Where we were.

478
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,790
That's where we saw crazy.
Lenny will was probably around the first

479
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,140
time I met you then.
Probably.

480
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:16,300
Yeah,
like 93 ish.

481
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,050
Somewhere in that range.
I remember meeting you at the club Soda.

482
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,460
Yeah.
That was fun.

483
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,720
And then we ran into each other again at
Amsterdam billiards pool.

484
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,370
There's only a few of us to play the 
pool already.

485
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:32,830
Lange plays real good.
Pool does a very good.

486
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,840
Fitzsimmons was here yesterday.
He plays real good.

487
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,920
Greg and I just played at the,
uh,

488
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,103
at the Improv.
They used to have a quarter table 

489
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:40,720
upstairs.
Oh really?

490
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah,
for hears.

491
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,320
Oh,
the set up up there.

492
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:47,420
It's very nice down now.
That whole green room with the,

493
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,610
the,
the uh,

494
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,020
podcast studio.
Yeah.

495
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:51,550
That's cool.
Very nice.

496
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,443
It's a good setup.
We're plugging the shit out of these 

497
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:56,740
clothes,
but yeah,

498
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:59,890
like at a guys who play pool I comics 
and play pool.

499
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,960
It's a fucking small group of us.
Yeah.

500
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,430
Not that many.
Who else?

501
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,323
Somebody else plays good.
I think a man Adam for a place for our 

502
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:10,350
police.
Very good place.

503
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,450
Very good.
Yeah.

504
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,570
He was at my house playing,
but I know a number.

505
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:16,180
Get you back there because there's too 
many obstacles.

506
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,210
Kind of Jack Up have one of those little
baby cues.

507
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,740
Well Joe,
who has room like this,

508
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:24,310
who has 50 feet on each side of a pool.
Well,

509
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:25,870
we're going to stream some stuff from 
here.

510
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,640
We're gonna eventually stream pool 
matches.

511
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,331
Oh yeah,
yeah,

512
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:29,164
yeah.
We're going to set up cameras and just 

513
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:34,330
talk shit and have a live stream.
You ever heard of twitch?

514
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,930
Do you know what twitches twitches?
A streaming service where you play games

515
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:39,070
on it?
Mostly video games.

516
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,933
Most people use it for video games,
but we've been talking to them about 

517
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:47,320
doing video games and then I'm thinking 
we might do some pool matches as well.

518
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,960
And even some archery put me up against 
Tosh.

519
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,720
Alright.
You go to play a little bit,

520
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:54,130
but I just,
I always beat him,

521
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:55,010
you know?
Oh,

522
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,190
just logical advantage.
I don't know.

523
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,420
I love beating him that.
And then shooting baskets because.

524
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,020
Because it calls me old man,
grandpa and all this shit.

525
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:03,460
So I want to beat him in something.
Uh,

526
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,303
you know what I'm modeling some of the,
what I do after Tosh in that he doesn't 

527
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:09,170
do any interviews.
He's like,

528
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:11,260
can I do enough?
So fucking smart.

529
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,160
He's so smart.
He's like,

530
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,160
he knows how to not be overexposed and 
I've,

531
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,400
I've fucked that up in the past and now 
I just like when I get here,

532
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,460
might get requests for interviews.
I'm like,

533
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:23,830
what?
I've said I say too much already.

534
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,973
I'm already talking to you.
Notice I never asked you again because 

535
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:29,410
he did me the favor and I don't want to 
push it,

536
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,740
but the fact is we had Jamie to fuck 
around with that time.

537
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,521
So No,
I will,

538
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:34,354
you know,
I'm not going to really nail you on an 

539
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:36,700
interview.
Make you.

540
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,080
What do you mean on your pod?
Yeah,

541
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,250
that's different.
I do friends podcasts at the time,

542
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,650
but it's,
I'm like interviews and real show,

543
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,020
stuff like that.
It's like you got nothing to gain Joe.

544
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,570
You're famous enough in Daniel's,
right?

545
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:51,250
I mean,
what,

546
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,630
what are you going to get good out of 
that?

547
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,540
Like doing Jimmy Kimmel doing five 
minutes.

548
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,483
You probably wouldn't want to do to 
stand up even though that your favorite 

549
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:02,660
thing and then you go over to the panel 
and like,

550
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,360
I like Craig Ferguson only because it 
was improv.

551
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,381
Right,
right,

552
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:07,340
right.
Well,

553
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:11,180
I think that sitting down and talking to
someone should be like this.

554
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,230
You really,
really,

555
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,560
really want to get to know somebody.
Yeah.

556
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,133
She talked to him like this.
Have I have a real conversation with 

557
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:17,414
them having a conversation with someone 
when you're under the gun of five 

558
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:21,434
minutes and you know,
there's a band there and you're sitting 

559
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:26,470
sideways and you're at the desk and I'm 
sitting over like this and you know,

560
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,640
we're talking about some project that 
I'm doing.

561
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,330
He eats like a quick pitch.
You have like a quick story that you can

562
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:34,430
tell.
And just so I understand your rent a car

563
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,840
when you come into the town.
What's that like?

564
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,270
That's funny.
Dumb,

565
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,380
you know?
Uh,

566
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,560
I do rent a car and I always take the 
insurance,

567
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:43,310
you know,
why?

568
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:48,200
Because I drive like a fucking maniac 
and New People here on highway 95.

569
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:49,034
What do you know,
what is going on with the drivers and 

570
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,570
last turn to the audience?
You know,

571
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,470
Ferguson show once and he gave me the 
wrong plug.

572
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,480
I was,
I had already worked that,

573
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,930
you know the Denver Club that you like 
so much comedy works.

574
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,773
Yeah,
I'd already worked at and they plugged 

575
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:04,540
it in and I said,
you know,

576
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,331
I came in,
I said,

577
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:06,950
Craig,
you got to really crack stamp here.

578
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:08,600
I already worked at Gig.
I said,

579
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:09,440
but I'm so hot.

580
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,333
I'm white hot in this business.
They have to post plug thing so there 

581
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,480
won't be a riot.
They said,

582
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,130
well,
we'll just start it over because they're

583
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:16,880
filming it.
I says,

584
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,390
no,
I didn't.

585
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,223
I got a spot in a couple of hours and 
he's starting it over and we got like 

586
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,530
an,
a fake argument.

587
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,450
It was the most fun I ever had doing the
live standup because I.

588
00:25:25,451 --> 00:25:26,284
So let me go,
go sit in your high chair and judge me 

589
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:28,784
like a little joke monkey and then I'll 
come over and we'll say funny stuff 

590
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:33,560
there too.
Well he's just doing stand up now.

591
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,200
Yeah,
yeah.

592
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,200
It's on Sirius too as well.
Yeah,

593
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,720
but just got tired of doing this show 
was in his name.

594
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:44,510
Hitler or something or really?
I think so.

595
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,220
His name is Hitler.
Craig Ferguson,

596
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:50,120
what kind of Asshole for a parent if 
you're born with the name of Hitler?

597
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,710
I don't care how far you get away from 
that.

598
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,110
I can't remember the whole name,
but I think Hitler was in the.

599
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,340
In the name.
The name,

600
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,750
like Hitler's Berg.
Butler Stein.

601
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,173
Scottish,
right?

602
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,440
Yeah.
What is it?

603
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,250
It says Bang Hitler.
It was like the eighties looks.

604
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,893
Yeah.
Yeah.

605
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,870
Oh,
being Hitler.

606
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,130
Was it a character that he was doing?
Yeah.

607
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,100
Yeah.
Oh,

608
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,130
I wish we could play it.
Oh,

609
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,140
look at him.
That's hilarious.

610
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,910
He's 12.
He looks like he's a kid in school.

611
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,860
Really the young face is with is fake.
Act was hair all fucked up.

612
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,783
Give me some money.

613
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,943
Wow.

614
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,760
That accent.
So it's so much thicker in it.

615
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,760
Wow.
From Mexico.

616
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:46,860
So he a character that was the character
that he'd do and the character,

617
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:49,840
he would go crazy with it.
Well,

618
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,753
there was a time and they're still.
Kala is still a time where we're in 

619
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:55,860
throttled by mediocre people with fake 
accents.

620
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,310
Not fake accents.
Accents from other places.

621
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,050
Foreign accents I should say.
Not fake.

622
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,650
It's like the thing that bothers me and 
I love standup and it was when a guy act

623
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,860
so different or like all of a sudden he 
goes into this character,

624
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,263
you know what I mean?
Instead of the funniest guys to me are 

625
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:17,280
guys that do characters but the 
themselves.

626
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,140
Yeah.
And they talked real like,

627
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,003
you know,
and that's why I mean you and burn you 

628
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,053
were the same guy as on and off stage.
You know when we're talking sometimes 

629
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:27,690
you get silly.
Sometimes you're serious.

630
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,430
You just be yourself.

631
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,660
Yeah,
I know what you're saying.

632
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,523
Be Sincere,
but you can be just as fucking goofy as 

633
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:37,200
you want,
but don't stay in that so hacky to me it

634
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:39,360
can be.
I'm always waiting for someone to do it.

635
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:41,010
Right.
So I don't want to pass judgment.

636
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,710
Like maybe one guy comes along and he's 
in character all the time,

637
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:46,440
but it's fucking hilarious.
It's possible.

638
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,920
I just watched jim carry on when he did.
Andy Kaufman.

639
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,900
Yeah,
it was fucking amazing.

640
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,700
Oh,
that was that the documentary?

641
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,601
That was.
Yeah,

642
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:57,990
that sprang sprang from that,
but I was watching the movie last night.

643
00:27:57,991 --> 00:28:01,350
I forget what it's called.
A man in the moon.

644
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,343
Yeah,
man on the moon.

645
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,093
What?
Jim's good.

646
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,550
Oh,
it's brilliant.

647
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,990
You know what's really interesting with 
him,

648
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,080
he's taken like a severe,
um,

649
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,400
psychological and philosophical turn 
where he's,

650
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,133
he's just thought about life and things.
So he must've had some psychedelic 

651
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:22,980
experiences too.

652
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,790
I think.
So.

653
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,900
Sounds like it.
Yeah.

654
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,763
Because he's just talking about what 
matters and what doesn't matter and you 

655
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:30,414
know,
and there's a bunch of interviews and 

656
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,083
uh,
clips of him discussing things where 

657
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:34,781
you're like,
whoa.

658
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:39,390
Like this guy does not.
He's not talking like Jim Carrey,

659
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:40,224
the world famous,
a list actor who's had gigantic smash 

660
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:46,230
movies.
He's not talking like that at all.

661
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:47,064
He like talking like some guy who's just
trying to sort of understand his place 

662
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:53,370
in the universe.
Yeah.

663
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:54,180
Yeah.
He's really,

664
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,240
really profound ways.
Very well thought out.

665
00:28:57,241 --> 00:29:00,340
God.
Thinking about him painting now.

666
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,850
It came out a couple months ago.
We didn't,

667
00:29:01,851 --> 00:29:03,840
we play this where some of his paintings
are really cool.

668
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:07,560
They're like a neon and he talks about,
he says some of the stuff that he's been

669
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:09,690
thinking about and dealing with.
So it's called,

670
00:29:09,691 --> 00:29:13,380
I need color and it's on Vimeo.
So folks can check that out.

671
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,670
I tell you about the below part.
I have been dying up here.

672
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,880
No.
Okay.

673
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,530
So I play fitzy Anderson because they 
wouldn't let me use Fritzi Anderson.

674
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,940
Remember 15 innocent?
No,

675
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,390
it's just they go on.
Hello?

676
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,850
Yeah.
And they wouldn't let it parents.

677
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:29,684
Why wouldn't they let you.
They said Fritzy was a slur for two 

678
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,460
Germans flats.
Yeah.

679
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:36,463
So anyway,
I go into the comedy store and a 

680
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,990
Thursday night,
why was there just to practice.

681
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:43,450
I know like real trying a couple lines 
and doing some shit.

682
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,180
And Jim's in the audience.
It comes out,

683
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:47,410
he hugs me.
And Anyway,

684
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,230
long story short,
he,

685
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,610
he was with his wife,
his ex wife,

686
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:54,790
and their daughter was ill,
a great girl.

687
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,860
She's a really good singer too,
by the way.

688
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,081
But anyway,
uh,

689
00:29:58,081 --> 00:29:59,480
they started talking and he said,
wow,

690
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,490
fucking funny.
Dom,

691
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:01,600
was she going to.
He goes,

692
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:04,690
I want to put them in this show.
And Melissa goes,

693
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,760
will tell you one thing.
He's not going to dance for you.

694
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,773
You want them to ask him,
but he ain't gonna audition it because 

695
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:10,714
I'm not going to make an addition.
I've known him for fucking 30 years 

696
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,503
anyway.
That's how I got the part and that 

697
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:15,010
funny.

698
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,790
Just randomly,
randomly he was.

699
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,480
He came in to look for young comedians.
I am not one of them.

700
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,800
We could tell by my receding hairline,
but yeah,

701
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:24,634
I mean an amazing.
I mean just there on the Thursday night 

702
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:28,660
randomly.
Is that show still going on?

703
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,810
Yeah,
we're shooting a shooting 10 more.

704
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,350
I got A.
I know I'm doing.

705
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:37,180
I'm an alcoholic,
an alcoholic the whole time,

706
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,950
which was.
I never watched it.

707
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,290
I watched one episode and I thought it 
was pretty good,

708
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:44,140
but I heard that it got better.
Yeah.

709
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,700
Yeah.
I heard that it was improving.

710
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,860
I heard.
Well,

711
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:47,694
you know all of those things.
Do you remember Seinfeld at the 

712
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:51,430
beginning?
I remember news radio.

713
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:52,264
The show I didn't.
Yeah,

714
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,000
it was clunky.
It took a while to really get rolling.

715
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:55,900
Yeah.
To get the rhythm.

716
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:58,420
What it is,
sitcoms are very difficult.

717
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,590
You know what I mean?

718
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,850
One of the reasons why people are like,
oh,

719
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,690
bonds,
there are any good sitcoms in the air.

720
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,731
Well,
God damn,

721
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:04,840
it's hard to do.
Well,

722
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:05,674
this is the serious one.
Like I'm kind of the comic relief on 

723
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:11,020
this because it's about like comedians 
but not like,

724
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:11,980
you know,
when we goof around,

725
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:15,570
Hi Parag and these llc,
hardly any of that.

726
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:19,600
And you see them more like jealous of 
each other and they're still in the dark

727
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:20,434
side of it.
The woman who plays the Mitzi part is 

728
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,673
Melissa Leo.
She's an academy award for some boxing 

729
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:26,884
movie.
I forget.

730
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,200
Uh,
but she,

731
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,230
she's playing Mitzi really serious and I
don't want to say anything because she's

732
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:38,950
a great actress,
but if I were a to give one note,

733
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:39,784
I would say they were.
Mitzi really had a fun side to her 

734
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:42,904
missing,
by the way,

735
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,010
for those of you who don't know is,
was the owner,

736
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,620
the owner of the comedy store,
pauly,

737
00:31:47,621 --> 00:31:50,500
shore's mom.
She brought us two things.

738
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,693
One of them was awesome.

739
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,480
Just kidding.
Has he been on the show?

740
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,523
Yeah,
he's been on.

741
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

742
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,980
I like Paulie.
He's a sweet guy.

743
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,540
He's a good guy to be around.
I keep giving people hugs and cit in,

744
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:06,430
in like all of us trying to.
Yeah.

745
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,170
Well he,
he had a hard life.

746
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:11,910
I mean he imagined being Babysat by Sam 
Kennison mean.

747
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,920
What in the fuck kind of crazy shit.
Is that Erica?

748
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,783
Sam Walton snap with your mom.
August Sam kinison hanging on your 

749
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:21,010
house.
Everybody's doing blow and you're going,

750
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,270
what?
The city.

751
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,560
It's so huge.
Gigantic at one point in time.

752
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,253
Who?
Sam?

753
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,670
Well Sam was for sure,
but.

754
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:31,770
So it was Paul Quality.
Yeah.

755
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:36,160
Paula was gigantic to.
Was it the weasel mean when he was doing

756
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:41,161
movies like in the army now with Andy,
Dick Number that Jesus Christ is huge.

757
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:45,560
We had a three picture deal and encino 
man.

758
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,970
I was another one biodome memory to 
biodome with Stephen Baldwin.

759
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,370
It was a good movie.
I enjoyed it.

760
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,780
Don't look at me like that.
Suddenly hire some people,

761
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,030
talk about them all the time.
He's fucking funny.

762
00:32:59,031 --> 00:32:59,864
Those movies were fucking funny.
I don't know what he did wrong or where 

763
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,980
it went wrong or you know,
sometimes it's like,

764
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:09,860
I think people just get bored.
They just want some new person.

765
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,320
Right.
Who's hot right now is tiffany haddish.

766
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,190
Oh shoot.
Do I love the curl?

767
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:16,800
You Ju Ju Ju?
She is.

768
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,950
I was trying to say Jewish by the way.
Is She?

769
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,630
Yeah,
she's Ethiopian Jewish.

770
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,590
No kidding.
Yeah.

771
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,993
Tiffany haddish is the person who told 
me about sickle cell anemia being 

772
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:26,954
related to malaria.
That people who have a resistance to 

773
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:34,160
malaria developed the trait for sickle 
cell anemia.

774
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,093
Wow.
That's where the origins of it are 

775
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,730
apparently.
And that's crazy.

776
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:41,580
It's primarily a Jewish and a black 
disease.

777
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,890
Is it a Jewish,
uh,

778
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,620
diseases and blacks get it than any 
other,

779
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,550
other.
It's interesting.

780
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,460
I did not know that.
I thought it was just blacks.

781
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,790
I had a friend of mine died from it.
Yeah.

782
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,110
My friend Walter.
Yup.

783
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,720
I'm from back.
Uh,

784
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,610
one of them was fighting who,
uh,

785
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,743
I remember it.
I would love to see if like I was a 

786
00:34:02,061 --> 00:34:02,990
different guy.
Man.

787
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,020
I was very intense.
I wasn't a very fun.

788
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,600
Did you ever think you'd be a comedian 
when you were in those days?

789
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,060
No,
I didn't think I was funny.

790
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,120
I made people laugh,
but the people that are made laugh,

791
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:14,954
we're all psychos.
They were all like guys that I was 

792
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:19,250
training and fighting and I was just 
like.

793
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:21,920
I felt like we were all freaks,
you know,

794
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,913
because we were martial artists that 
were traveling literally all around the 

795
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:29,000
country and entering into these full 
contact tournament's.

796
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,883
You don't have any video.
There's a video of me on youtube really 

797
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:34,160
knocking somebody out.
Yeah.

798
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,100
When I was 19 and Connecticut.
You think you could beat me in court?

799
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,770
No,
I couldn't.

800
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:41,300
I love you too much.
I just hold you.

801
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,200
Well,
you know what you do,

802
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:44,360
which is really interesting for a guy 
that strong.

803
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,223
You never know right there.
Doesn't mean the blue like kicked that 

804
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:51,040
guy in law school.
That's all.

805
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:54,910
I have some other video on my computer 
somewhere.

806
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,940
Some like uneventful round of some 
taekwondo tournament.

807
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:00,944
There's a guy out there has got a couple
of videos made though and he and I've 

808
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,000
gone back and forth.
On what way were you?

809
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:10,570
That was 1:54 when I was in senior year 
in high school.

810
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:14,600
I fought at 1:40 and that was too light.
It was too hard for me.

811
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:18,630
I was always dehydrating myself and I 
would uh,

812
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,230
like uh,
do things in the shower,

813
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:22,064
like jump up and down in the shower and 
shadow box and the shower with the hot 

814
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,410
water on and try to sweat out weight.

815
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,753
I couldn't eat for like a whole day and 
then I would fight that day and it was 

816
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:33,590
terrible.
I did that for one year.

817
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,440
Well my father was a professional boxer 
and he,

818
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:39,300
uh,
but he was the bad thing about it.

819
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:43,560
He was a $500 bucks or oh no,
box 500 and baseball.

820
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:45,510
You the greatest player ever,
but boxing you,

821
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,180
you got to be like 800,
you know,

822
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,220
at least make a living.
When he won,

823
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:54,030
he would come home and beaten up.
That must have been hard to see.

824
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,840
I'm all fucked up.
You.

825
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,913
I see people that fight in the UFC and 
their kids come to hug him in the cage 

826
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,093
and you know,
you see the terrified look in their 

827
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:07,314
children's face and they're looking.
The guy's eyes all fucked up and got 

828
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,520
some different group or different type 
of human being that does that.

829
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,353
I had so much fun though.
The time you invited me to the one in 

830
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:23,730
Montreal where the guy who's the king of
Montreal was George St Pierre.

831
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,593
That was incredible.
It was the loudest noise of cheers I've 

832
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:28,140
ever heard.
They love him.

833
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,483
And the other one was when we went to 
the places that were those guys who own 

834
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:35,340
the Sacramento Kings,
the,

835
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:39,500
the plate with the playboy club.
And you had fights there.

836
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,730
You know what I'm talking about that 
it's off the strip.

837
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,830
The Palms?
Yes.

838
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,800
Yes.
And one of the cool moments,

839
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:48,840
I mean even though he realized how 
powerful and how real it is,

840
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,430
this kid got knocked down.
I was sitting next to his mother and his

841
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,603
wife and he wouldn't wake up for a 
couple minutes and then he finally got 

842
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:57,624
up,
but then there was another kid who was 

843
00:36:59,041 --> 00:36:59,874
like in the cartoons.
He ran up the wall and I don't know how 

844
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:05,520
the fuck he did it and he just is young 
black kid.

845
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,490
He ran up the wall and went upside down 
and then landed on his feet.

846
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,691
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

847
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:14,670
John Dodson is pretty sure it was young 
males that after fights he runs up.

848
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,010
Yeah.
He's a freak.

849
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,990
Awesome athlete.
Yeah.

850
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,723
Yeah.
That's a different kinds of human being 

851
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,920
that does that.
It's to be in that world that's a.

852
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,210
that's a pool to send an intense 
existence.

853
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:36,020
That's unlike very many other this in 
this war.

854
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:37,280
Other than war.
You know,

855
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:40,200
war is probably the most intense 
existence.

856
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,780
Guys who are warriors?
Actual soldiers.

857
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,573
Other than that,
I think mma fighters and then obviously 

858
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:48,880
first responders,
firefighters,

859
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,920
cops,
things on those.

860
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,783
Oh Man.
I was thinking about that with those 

861
00:37:52,141 --> 00:37:53,820
fires this year.
Oh God.

862
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:54,803
My Body's a firefighter.
He was up there and now he's in Simi 

863
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,443
Valley and they shipped him out with 
everybody else and he tell me it was 

864
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:04,230
insane.
He's like,

865
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:05,400
you,
you just,

866
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,910
you couldn't stop the fire.
It was just too big and there,

867
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:12,090
you know that thousands of firefighters.
And here's the other thing,

868
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,240
not just thousands of firefighters but 
prisoners really.

869
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,850
They had prisoners working the fire.
They could get out early,

870
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:19,110
baby.
I don't think so.

871
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,420
I think they got paid and I don't think 
they got paid much.

872
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:23,160
I think the unpaid,
like a dollar an hour,

873
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,640
something fucked up and they're out 
there working on the fires.

874
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,540
I'll just pretend I got burned.
Just run into the fire.

875
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,080
Wow.
I'm free.

876
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,150
I got a fake Id.
I'm going to Mexico.

877
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,820
Yeah.
Um,

878
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,500
I'm pretty sure they did.
I think that's one of the most fucked up

879
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:42,334
things about prison is that they get 
them to work and they pay them like 

880
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:46,690
pennies.
I didn't know that.

881
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,240
I mean,
I know they get them to clean up or even

882
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:52,120
if you have a dui you can get that and 
that won't even go into prison.

883
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,100
Yeah,
right.

884
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,191
I'm pretty sure.
Yeah,

885
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:56,140
you can,
when you can work it off or pay it off,

886
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,740
clean the sides of roads.
A friend of mine did that instead of.

887
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:02,080
He didn't have the money.
How much is the money to Pay Dui?

888
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,720
Uh,
I think it all comes around 10,

889
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,733
10 grand.
Met with the lawyer and everything been 

890
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,890
granted.
A dollar an hour is a long time.

891
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,410
Oh my God.
If they really pay a dollar an hour.

892
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,610
Yeah.
Well,

893
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,920
you know,
like at the Dui,

894
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,290
just use uber it now.
Most of the time,

895
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:18,680
right?
Yeah.

896
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,940
I drunk right now.
No.

897
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,220
Do I look joke?
That would be sad.

898
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,230
I get nervous when I talk to you.
We've been friends for 30 years almost.

899
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,790
Holy Shit.
Not Crazy.

900
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,193
We've been friends for 25 years,
somewhere in the neighborhood of 25 

901
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:38,290
years.
That's a long time.

902
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:40,240
Mr Herrera.
That's crazy.

903
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,493
Nut nuts.
Do you think I'd have more material by 

904
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:46,630
now?
You've already used it off.

905
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:47,820
Hey,
are you a,

906
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:51,670
you're talking about filming something?
What do you mean?

907
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,370
Are you talking about filming a special?
You know what?

908
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:55,204
I did one last time.
I was on the show you told me I should 

909
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:58,660
do when I did it and I just didn't like 
it.

910
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,340
Oh,
when did you do it?

911
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,070
I'm not,
whatever.

912
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:02,904
The last time I was on the show,
it's like a year ago I would imagine a 

913
00:40:05,741 --> 00:40:06,574
little more.

914
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,640
And then I waited about three months and
I shot it.

915
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,980
And uh,
you just said not to release it?

916
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,330
Yeah.
What was wrong with it?

917
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,850
Like what didn't feel good about it?
I don't know.

918
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:20,851
I just didn't my ass look fat.
I just didn't like it.

919
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,933
I didn't.
It didn't seem to have the energy I 

920
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:25,750
thought I have,
you know.

921
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,603
Huh.
So it didn't feel to you like 

922
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:30,850
representative of a real set that you 
would have?

923
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:33,490
I got a just a normal night at a club.
That's all I wanted.

924
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,353
Did you feel pressure?
Because that's one of the things that I 

925
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:37,384
feel that I've always battle when I do a
special is that like here's the moment 

926
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,420
it's now ready.
Go.

927
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,810
And one of the best ways I found to 
combat that I was to do a bunch of shows

928
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:47,740
I do for chefs.
See,

929
00:40:47,741 --> 00:40:48,310
that's smart.

930
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,600
I did two.
Yeah,

931
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,670
two is tight and they were back to back.
Yeah.

932
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,800
Sometimes people clam up.
I've seen people do one and it becomes a

933
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:57,634
disaster.
You could feel the tightness on stage 

934
00:40:59,831 --> 00:41:03,190
because there's so much riding on it,
but it's just not just a regular show.

935
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,870
There's no room really to fuck around.
You got to have room to fuck around.

936
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:10,840
Like part of what a live show is is 
flowing.

937
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,850
I mean I would like to get myself in a 
club where I'm half once,

938
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,813
like if something's worth talking about 
with the audience member or something 

939
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:21,340
that's really cool,
I would do it.

940
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:22,174
But just being normal club set that's a 
little more normal but very strong club 

941
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,270
set.
Where did you film a.

942
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:31,840
The laugh factory in Vegas.
Yeah,

943
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:32,801
that's.
You remember that.

944
00:41:32,801 --> 00:41:33,634
So you still laugh factory in Hollywood.
That's a comfortable club for you and 

945
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:37,790
they already set up for filming.

946
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:38,750
Yeah,
I know.

947
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:40,280
I could do it any night.
Yeah,

948
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:41,114
maybe that's a good move.
Well Jamie one that had taped me like a 

949
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,790
couple of weeks in a row doing like 40 
minutes.

950
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,410
You know,
you should,

951
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,330
that's a great place to do it,
dom,

952
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,070
because they filmed me.
Whether you like it or not there.

953
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,280
Yeah.
Well we talked about this.

954
00:41:55,281 --> 00:41:58,910
That's not a good sign,
but they do have the setup.

955
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:02,090
They have the setup to film you there.
Vegas Room is nice,

956
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,690
isn't it?
You know,

957
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,010
is that a trap?
That's.

958
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,650
Here's the thing that's great about 
Vegas,

959
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:08,470
Joe,
is that you could do that.

960
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,433
I'm doing the first week of April.
I think the trop dental do Brad Garret 

961
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,920
club too because they don't give a fuck.
It's Vegas.

962
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,930
Vegas.
I'm like Columbus,

963
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:20,690
Ohio.
They have the same audience pretty much,

964
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,580
you know.
But uh,

965
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,950
they're,
they have the audience comes in from far

966
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:25,880
away every week.

967
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,030
So you could play Vegas a lot.
That is true.

968
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,670
Like that's one of the reasons why 
residency works in Vegas.

969
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,063
Always anywhere else.
Have you ever thought about doing that 

970
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,530
residency?
I think,

971
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:39,710
well,
I think I killed myself in Vegas.

972
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,993
Just boozing and yeah,
hanging out and the rhino at three in 

973
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:45,850
the morning.
Fistfuls of dollars.

974
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,690
Dat,
Dat,

975
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,350
Dat,
dat type.

976
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,560
I go out with this girl and she got 
really hot daughters right when she shot

977
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,700
the girl you're dating and she's very 
hot,

978
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,740
but she's always telling me how 
beautiful her daughters or I go,

979
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,491
look,
I know,

980
00:42:58,491 --> 00:43:00,890
but I don't watch step.
Stop pimping off your daughters to me.

981
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,600
But I took.
I took him to see tosh.

982
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:09,610
I was in the town for the superbowl and 
Daniel was at the mirage and it gets,

983
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,260
I forget how big a deal it would be to a
16 year old boy to meet him.

984
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,080
And we went back and he was saying he 
was so gracious with them,

985
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:18,914
but it was,
I couldn't believe it because this kid 

986
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,690
played John Lennon in loves it when he 
was a little kid.

987
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:26,000
So he's got.
He's been around theatrical people,

988
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,510
you know,
love the Beatles.

989
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,010
That needles thing is fucking amazing.
Good at the Mirage.

990
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:31,893
Yeah,
yeah,

991
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:32,983
yeah.
They started that acapella because it 

992
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,150
was very cool.
I know you're a huge Beatles fan.

993
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,220
Yeah.
You've always been a big beatles fan.

994
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:41,054
So I,
I took my family to see that about a 

995
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,460
month ago or so,
went to see that the Mirage.

996
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,930
Fuck.
It's incredible.

997
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:51,350
It's such a showman and it cool to see 
your kids kind of digging it.

998
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,090
Yeah.
Get all those years ago.

999
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:53,924
And you know,
I know so many little kids that liked 

1000
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:57,590
the Beatles.
It's weird.

1001
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,860
They're so good.
They were so good and you.

1002
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:01,903
And I think it's hard for someone today 
in 2018 with this vast variety of music 

1003
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:10,460
that we have and so much good music over
the history of music,

1004
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:11,294
you know,
so much recording that it's hard to 

1005
00:44:13,491 --> 00:44:18,410
understand how in the 19 sixties how 
amazing the Beatles were.

1006
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,013
Then out of nowhere this band out of 
Liverpool comes out and they just have 

1007
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:28,820
this revolutionary music.
It's just so much of it is so different.

1008
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:29,654
Yeah.
It was very different and they were the 

1009
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:34,440
ones they orchestras and all this stuff,
you know,

1010
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,420
it reminds me of the,
uh,

1011
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:39,330
the thing we were talking about before 
of the sitcoms.

1012
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:44,010
They were given a chance to get better.
A lot of people today,

1013
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,410
if they,
if they're bad records,

1014
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:50,080
they're out and they got some other 
beautiful girl replacing them.

1015
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,113
It's true.
You know,

1016
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,580
it's the same way with fighters.
You know,

1017
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:56,550
I've had this conversation with my 
friend Brendan Schaub and I were talking

1018
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:58,160
about this the other day,
but yeah,

1019
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,933
big brown guys get into the UFC too 
young and then they're fighting top 

1020
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:04,644
flight competition like right away and 
it's either sink or swim and some guy 

1021
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:08,723
swim,
but some guys have real massive 

1022
00:45:09,661 --> 00:45:10,494
potential,
but really they should be fighting 

1023
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:14,880
someone of a lower caliber and 
developing their skills and experiencing

1024
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:15,714
a bunch of different styles and then 
eventually working their way up to the 

1025
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:18,924
UFC after five,
six years or so and instead they're 

1026
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:22,014
fighting in the UFC at 20 years old and 
they're just not really ready for top 

1027
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,270
flight competition.
[inaudible]

1028
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,630
in the UFC,
if you string together five,

1029
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:28,464
six wins,
you're entitled contention some weight 

1030
00:45:30,181 --> 00:45:30,841
divisions.
Yeah.

1031
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:34,110
That'll discourage the shit out of you 
and you're getting fucked up by some guy

1032
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:36,510
who's just many,
many levels above you.

1033
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:37,344
You really shouldn't be fighting him.
Like the flyweight division is perfect 

1034
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:42,600
example because it's run by this guy 
demetrius mighty mouse,

1035
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:43,434
Johnson's probably best pound for pound 
fighter that's ever lived and he's 

1036
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,060
saying something,
man,

1037
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,550
he's fucking incredible and he's a 
wizard,

1038
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,593
like he barely gets hit and you know,
and we've seen him in the octagon 

1039
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:59,610
develop and grow and become this guy and
now now he's just just,

1040
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,720
uh,
there's everybody.

1041
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:03,090
And then there's mighty mouse.
Mighty mouse is just another level above

1042
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:03,924
everybody.
I never seen anybody as good as 

1043
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,890
mayweather to avoid punches.
No one's better.

1044
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:08,971
No,
no one,

1045
00:46:08,971 --> 00:46:10,560
no one gets hit less.
It's incredible.

1046
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,240
I mean guys 50,
you know,

1047
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:14,010
and obviously one of them was conor 
Mcgregor,

1048
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,740
which is kinda crazy,
but it connor hit him,

1049
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,780
you know,
connor can crack,

1050
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,300
but he just didn't had no business in 
the ring.

1051
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,263
Honestly.
Maybe we really didn't know if he had 

1052
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:25,620
business in the ring until he fought 
them after the fact.

1053
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:26,454
It's easy to say that.
Like he caught him with that upper cut 

1054
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,520
in the first round.
What if we wobbled them?

1055
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,413
What have you heard?
Anybody can get crazy if you get hit 

1056
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:34,920
right.
Anybody can get knocked out,

1057
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:38,280
but may whether it's been hit right 
where he was hurt.

1058
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,680
I don't think conor hurt him.
I think he just hit him good,

1059
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,380
but he's been her sugar.
Shane Mosley heard him.

1060
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,060
He's been hurt a couple of times in his 
career,

1061
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,253
but over the course of 50 professional 
fights where most of them are at world 

1062
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,170
championship level.

1063
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,140
It's crazy remarkable.
I was watching the.

1064
00:46:55,141 --> 00:47:00,141
They had like a highlights of the MMA 
and the when Fox today and Rhonda Rousey

1065
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:04,950
when she got kicked in the face though.
What a great kick that was.

1066
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,120
Holly Holm?
Yeah,

1067
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:08,220
that was in Australia.
I remember being there for that.

1068
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,001
Oh,
that was a Melbourne,

1069
00:47:09,001 --> 00:47:10,530
right?
I think it was in Sydney.

1070
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,430
It wasn't.
Yeah,

1071
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:12,263
I'm pretty sure.
Sydney.

1072
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,370
That was crazy.
It might've been Melbourne.

1073
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,590
You might be right.
Might be right.

1074
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,700
I think you're right now that I think 
about.

1075
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,220
I think you're right.
No,

1076
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:22,610
you're definitely right.
Now that I know I'm stop.

1077
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,840
Bargain with yourself.
Leave yourself alone.

1078
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:27,540
You're a good person trying to remember.
I love Melbourne.

1079
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,183
I love that great restaurant.
It was just going to say that great 

1080
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:34,910
coffee to Donovan's.
They have everything like their seafoods

1081
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:35,763
fantastic,
but it's almost like I'm an artsy sort 

1082
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:39,690
of San Francisco.

1083
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,040
Yeah,
San Francisco's the one I compare it to.

1084
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,540
Yeah,
but it's got its own thing.

1085
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,040
Yeah.
Melbourne's got its own thing.

1086
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,590
Fucking crowds are amazing.
Oh cool.

1087
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:49,000
And so fun.
Yeah,

1088
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,253
they're great up there.
I did a comedy store in Sydney in 

1089
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:53,044
between like bigger gigs that takes to 
make it worth it for them to bring you 

1090
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,164
over them and I love it.
I love the culture and the of data to 

1091
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:03,520
Ari and I did the comedy store in Sydney
on a Sunday night on a whim.

1092
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:04,923
The fights took place early in the day 
so that it could be in the UFC pay per 

1093
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:09,214
view,
so we called up the comedy store and 

1094
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:11,440
said,
Hey,

1095
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,590
can we do an impromptu show tonight?
We'll just put it up on twitter and they

1096
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,100
said,
all right,

1097
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,420
hold on,
let me call you right back.

1098
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,110
All right,
we do it.

1099
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:19,540
Let's do it.
And so we put it on twitter and then Ari

1100
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:21,410
and I went and did a show that night.
The kid.

1101
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,660
They came.
Yeah,

1102
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:23,570
it was packed.
Yeah.

1103
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:24,783
It was awfully heavy draw like you 
helped me get a drone in Australia and 

1104
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:28,870
that amazing.
Crazy.

1105
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,180
Yeah.
I mean when I was,

1106
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,240
when I started.
Now if you get on the tonight show,

1107
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,760
that would be the first time hole all of
America.

1108
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:39,880
So you get the whole world not like 
this.

1109
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,240
The whole world hears this.
Yeah.

1110
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:45,060
This thing has got its own life.
I remember that.

1111
00:48:45,061 --> 00:48:49,030
I'm just here working the wheel.
I was at your house one day when kind of

1112
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,250
like you had started it,
but you said you feel,

1113
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,533
forget what the exact word,
but be a momentum going when you felt 

1114
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:59,920
you knew something was something 
incredible was going to happen with this

1115
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:00,310
show.

1116
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,350
Do you remember that?
Well then you just had the.

1117
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:04,840
You told me you have a feeling like you 
weren't bragging.

1118
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:05,943
Not at all,
but was just like going with the energy 

1119
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:08,344
of it,
you know.

1120
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:09,243
Well,
I was,

1121
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:12,670
I was saying that I felt like there's 
something going on.

1122
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,140
Yeah,
like this show,

1123
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:17,170
like it was just starting to pick up 
momentum then and I was like,

1124
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:18,004
there's something going on here.
And then I was thinking about what the 

1125
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:23,740
potential was and at the time when we 
first started,

1126
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,020
there wasn't that many people listening 
to podcasts.

1127
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:26,883
It was very small and uh,
we were also streaming live on youtube 

1128
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:30,813
ustream and there wasn't many people 
listening to that either or watching 

1129
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:34,600
that,
but I was like,

1130
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:38,470
but this keeps growing and I,
and I knew that I was very interested in

1131
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:39,304
doing it,
so I knew I was going to get better at 

1132
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:41,940
it and I was always trying to figure out
what,

1133
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:46,270
what ways I could do it better,
how to get out of my own way,

1134
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,270
how to not talk over people,
knowing when to talk,

1135
00:49:49,271 --> 00:49:50,110
when not to talk.

1136
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:51,940
I had to figure that out.
It's tricky.

1137
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,310
It is tricky.
It's tricky to um,

1138
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,183
to pay you.
You have to put yourself in the seat of 

1139
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:00,904
the person that's listening.
And I think listening to podcasts helps 

1140
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,560
that as well and listening to things 
that you don't enjoy.

1141
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:06,663
So he's.
One of the things that Stephen King 

1142
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,160
always says about writing is that you 
should.

1143
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:10,630
Right.
But you should also read,

1144
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,693
you should read a lot.
I think that's the case with podcast 

1145
00:50:13,901 --> 00:50:14,734
too.
I think that's the case with standup as 

1146
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:16,654
well.
I think listening to other standup is 

1147
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:21,190
good as long as you're not getting ideas
from them,

1148
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,020
you know,
as long as you're just enjoying it.

1149
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,440
Like the good feeling that you get from 
watching stand up watching someone kill,

1150
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,783
you know,
it's like I get inspired by it and it 

1151
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:33,140
makes me.
And then I see things,

1152
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:35,870
maybe they're a little clunky in 
someone's act,

1153
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,810
like how they need to clean that up or 
tighten this up.

1154
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:39,883
And it makes me more cognizant about 
those flaws in my own act and makes me 

1155
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:45,090
more,
more self aware.

1156
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:46,303
I love to watch like say like Chris Rock
when he does something and then two 

1157
00:50:49,791 --> 00:50:52,800
weeks later we're,
you know,

1158
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,060
he's got a germ of something there,
but he's so good at putting it,

1159
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,460
you know,
setting it up to be a potentially really

1160
00:50:58,461 --> 00:50:59,400
great bit,
you know?

1161
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:00,523
Well,
he's one of the all time greats for a 

1162
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:04,010
reason and one of the reasons is he's a 
real craftsman.

1163
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,560
He's a real artist.
You know,

1164
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,553
Chris will go in there and he will.
He's not just trying to kill every time 

1165
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:13,190
he goes onstage,
you know,

1166
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:17,050
he's,
he's trying to develop material and he's

1167
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,690
using that time and it is a very 
valuable thing for him,

1168
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:21,290
you know?
Well,

1169
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:24,260
I,
I really believe that this generation is

1170
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:25,094
better than the generation I started 
with and only because they got to see 

1171
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:30,830
them and grow from them.

1172
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:32,143
You know what I mean?
Like you had to have somebody in the 

1173
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,810
middle because I mean honestly,
you know,

1174
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,153
you and bill to me,
I take you and bill over prior and the 

1175
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,330
Carlin,
that's sacrilege.

1176
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,430
Serious.
I stand ups.

1177
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,700
But,
you know,

1178
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,970
and I'm not saying that because you're 
my friend and when we're here,

1179
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:50,340
I'm saying I,
I seen these guys and I loved,

1180
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,360
I loved them,
you know,

1181
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,193
I mean,
I was one of those kids who grew up 

1182
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:56,460
watching him,
but I think it just is this,

1183
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,550
your generation has taken it to a 
different level.

1184
00:51:59,020 --> 00:51:59,853
There's a,
there's definitely a benefit of being 

1185
00:52:01,071 --> 00:52:03,080
able to see the people before you.
For sure.

1186
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,230
I've,
I've learned a lot watching other comedy

1187
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,060
work,
watching people just getting,

1188
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,130
you know,
we were talking yesterday about Richard,

1189
00:52:10,131 --> 00:52:11,480
Jenny,
that um,

1190
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,430
I think I'm brilliant writer.
Oh,

1191
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:14,910
you're so good with him.

1192
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:15,501
I said,
man,

1193
00:52:15,501 --> 00:52:18,190
with sandals,
I think of him say,

1194
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,190
Hey,
you're doing this.

1195
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:22,060
Spartacus.
Yeah.

1196
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,450
Um,
he,

1197
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:27,380
uh,
I was listening to one of his recordings

1198
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:29,870
on the way home.
A big steaming pile of me,

1199
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:31,150
like a,
I don't know,

1200
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,570
at least a year ago.
It's probably more,

1201
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,733
but I remember like getting a noticeable
bump in my writing after I listened to 

1202
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:41,951
it because it was so inspiring and that 
I think that's a giant advantage that we

1203
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:43,394
have today with like youtube and itunes 
and things along those lines where you 

1204
00:52:47,271 --> 00:52:48,104
can listen to anything you want.
I can go back and I was listening to an 

1205
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:55,020
old woody allen recording the other day,
just in my car driving.

1206
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:57,520
Now listen to Woody Allen,
do standup in the 1967.

1207
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:01,160
You could tell he was a fucking pervert.
Even back then there was a line,

1208
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,730
there was a line in love if there was a 
line in love and death.

1209
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,380
Remember loving death?
Yes.

1210
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:07,903
And Diane Keaton goes to this high 
priest and she steps on his beard and 

1211
00:53:11,501 --> 00:53:12,334
it's very funny scene and he says the 
most beautiful thing in the world is a 

1212
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:17,930
12 year old girl,
blonde hair,

1213
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:19,880
preferably twins,
right?

1214
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:21,610
And this is all this perverted.
The thing is,

1215
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:26,910
this happened 20 years,
25 before he got accused of anything,

1216
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:28,443
you know,
but it was just interesting hearing 

1217
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,353
because he did a couple of.
He did it even in Manhattan with 

1218
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,670
Hemingway was a little bit,
little bit twisted,

1219
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,520
you know,
I don't remember Manhattan very much.

1220
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,383
Well,
he falls in love and she pulls a love 

1221
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:41,214
with him.
She's supposed to be 16 and he's Jesus 

1222
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:45,510
Christ.
Yeah.

1223
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:48,330
Well it's not something that people tend
to do.

1224
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,860
They try to normalize whatever fucked up
provision they have and they put it into

1225
00:53:52,861 --> 00:53:53,694
art.
Like that was one of the things that 

1226
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:55,554
they were accusing Louis Ck of with this
movie that he released right before it 

1227
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:02,800
came out that he was jerking off in 
front of a bunch of metal.

1228
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:03,973
The had this movie and part of the movie
was just talking about how everyone's a 

1229
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:09,660
pervert.
We're all perverts.

1230
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,950
I'll tell you something off the air.
Okay.

1231
00:54:11,951 --> 00:54:13,200
Can we get off?
Remind me to tell you.

1232
00:54:13,201 --> 00:54:17,100
I don't want to say off the with dom.
I rare.

1233
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:17,934
That's your new show off the air with 
Dom Irrera burn people and any context 

1234
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,910
had,
hey,

1235
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:27,640
is this thing on?
It's not good.

1236
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,790
Let me tell you a story.
I got to go actually,

1237
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,960
the night that he was,
or the day after he went,

1238
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:35,040
I went on stage.
I got.

1239
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:36,510
I said,
I'm so excited.

1240
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:40,860
I got a part in a Louis ck new TV show.
Should shoot in about 10,

1241
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:45,030
15 years and it took them a beat and 
then they got it.

1242
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:48,120
I think he'll be back in a year.
Well,

1243
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:49,830
you know what Joe,
he has that advantage of.

1244
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:52,860
He was the one that created the idea of 
selling your own thing.

1245
00:54:52,861 --> 00:54:54,840
Right.
So he can do that.

1246
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,150
He doesn't need a producer for that.
That's true.

1247
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,910
That's true.
You'd have him on this show,

1248
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:00,090
right?

1249
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:01,290
I would.
One hundred percent of them on.

1250
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:02,383
Yeah.
I think he's a different person than 

1251
00:55:05,821 --> 00:55:08,790
when he did those things.
I think those things that he did jerking

1252
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:09,624
off in front of him punch people's 
terrible and I think he probably had an 

1253
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,063
idea in his head of what those things 
were and of who he was and who he would 

1254
00:55:17,371 --> 00:55:18,204
be.
And I think a lot of your self 

1255
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:24,861
definitions a lot of times are based on 
this very limited idea of who you are.

1256
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:26,723
Very limited idea of who you're going to
be and he's like a wallowing in his own 

1257
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:32,460
weirdness and just wants a jerk off in 
front of somebody,

1258
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:33,773
you know,
it's out of all the offenses of things 

1259
00:55:36,061 --> 00:55:36,894
you could do to someone.
It's one of the least egregious because 

1260
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:41,210
he's not raping.
He's not as.

1261
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,600
He didn't lock the door.
He's not.

1262
00:55:42,601 --> 00:55:43,590
Yeah,
he didn't lock the door.

1263
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:45,990
He's not doing anything awful to 
someone.

1264
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,420
He just doing something weird in front 
of them.

1265
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,760
I think it's beautiful to,
you know,

1266
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,833
I don't think it's beautiful because a 
lot of things that I think of you to 

1267
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:55,590
think it's a plus.
It's definitely a black.

1268
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,300
Well,
it's,

1269
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,450
it's human.
Like

1270
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:58,363
then I bet at it out of the air because 
of an ape doesn't really care if you 

1271
00:56:00,951 --> 00:56:02,850
jerk and if you're watching when he's 
jerking off,

1272
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,550
it could be the jerky over the banana 
and one hand banana and the other.

1273
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:08,830
Get it.
Hey,

1274
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,470
hey,
hey.

1275
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:13,543
Yeah.
I'm at all the things that he did and I 

1276
00:56:14,961 --> 00:56:19,961
think that his apology pretty was what's
a way to look at it?

1277
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,910
Um,
I think it honest and I think it sort of

1278
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:29,310
explained how his mind worked and why he
did it in the first place.

1279
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:30,163
It's not,
it's obviously not something you're 

1280
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,730
proud of.
So obviously something he's disgusted by

1281
00:56:33,731 --> 00:56:35,740
himself and you can't.
Here's the thing,

1282
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,930
you jerk off in front of someone 10 
years ago.

1283
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,840
How do you fix that?
You don't do it again.

1284
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,760
He hasn't done it again.
Here's the thing.

1285
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,760
No one's saying these done anything in a
long time.

1286
00:56:45,761 --> 00:56:46,594
Like all the accusations were like,
I want to say they were from there or 

1287
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,150
from years ago.
Right.

1288
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,010
What do you do?
Like how do you fix that clicks?

1289
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,300
Let's say you did jerk off in front of a
few people.

1290
00:56:58,301 --> 00:56:58,841
Dom,
like,

1291
00:56:58,841 --> 00:56:59,230
you know,
like,

1292
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:01,790
I don't know why that came up for the 
blind lady is,

1293
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,110
is it still killed?
It depends on how good are hearing is.

1294
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,340
Oh,
she's here.

1295
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:12,290
She's like,
why are you doing over there at dawn?

1296
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,510
And she has to guess.
It's all fucking guesswork.

1297
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,670
What do you,
how do you fix that?

1298
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,470
Like what does a guy do to fix that?
I mean,

1299
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:28,330
I think out of all the people,
like how the fuck would you rehabilitate

1300
00:57:28,331 --> 00:57:30,610
Harvey Weinstein?
How do you let Harvey Weinstein around a

1301
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:31,450
woman again,
how do you,

1302
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,850
how do you leave Harvey Weinstein in a 
hotel room with a woman who comes in for

1303
00:57:35,851 --> 00:57:38,530
a meeting or it was the worst.
He's the worst.

1304
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,393
He's the word.
I don't think you can rehabilitate to 

1305
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:41,500
him.
What do you do?

1306
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:42,610
How do you,
how do you,

1307
00:57:42,611 --> 00:57:43,510
uh,
how do you fix that?

1308
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:46,610
The only way cosby gets rehabilitated,
um,

1309
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:47,583
I mean not really rehabilitated,
but the only way he gets reintroduced 

1310
00:57:49,661 --> 00:57:50,494
into society is if everyone believes 
those girls are lying and that's never 

1311
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:53,500
going to happen.

1312
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,520
It's impossible because everybody heard 
those stories a long time ago when I did

1313
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:58,354
star search and like 83 and he was the 
guest host and we were hearing shit 

1314
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:07,270
about him on the set.
Then really womanizing and stuff.

1315
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,133
Yeah.
I mean Chris,

1316
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:11,710
not as extreme as a drug and drug and 
raping them.

1317
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,450
But like if you're a guy like Louis,
c,

1318
00:58:13,451 --> 00:58:15,130
k,
how do you,

1319
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:17,720
what do you do?
Like what would he,

1320
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:22,150
what could he have done before the story
came out that he's doing that to girls?

1321
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:26,350
What,
what could he have done to make amends?

1322
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:27,250
I mean,
what could you have done?

1323
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,173
He said sorry to some of the people.
I don't know why you looking at me like 

1324
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:31,540
that.
I'm just trying to think.

1325
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,550
I'm just trying to.
You're my friend.

1326
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,570
I'm looking at you and you're right 
there.

1327
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:39,010
I'm just thinking like what would one 
do?

1328
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:43,750
I mean it seems like let's.
I mean I'm not exonerating him.

1329
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:44,584
Right?
But it seems like all these years since 

1330
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:48,880
then he hasn't done it again.
Right.

1331
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:49,923
So if he hasn't done it again,
he must understand that there's 

1332
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:56,920
something wrong with it.
There's some weird compulsion and it had

1333
00:58:56,921 --> 00:59:00,190
to be a power thing because anybody can 
get a hooker and do that.

1334
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,980
No.
Well here's the thing.

1335
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,070
He was probably doing that too.
Yeah,

1336
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,040
I mean it'd be like jerking off in front
of people.

1337
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:11,410
He might've just like jerking off in 
front of all kinds of people.

1338
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:13,060
He might've jerked off in front of 
hookers to.

1339
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:13,983
I mean,
I don't know,

1340
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,790
but we know that he did it in front of 
women that really didn't want them to do

1341
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:18,624
that.
That's what I thought might be part of 

1342
00:59:19,361 --> 00:59:21,980
the kinkiness,
but

1343
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,813
there's some stories of him doing it in 
front of women and they thought it was 

1344
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:27,680
hilarious.
He did it in front of some female comics

1345
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:28,783
and they thought it was hilarious.
How do you stay hard when they're 

1346
00:59:30,951 --> 00:59:33,170
laughing?
You've got to be a real animal.

1347
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,470
It's better than better man than me.
Dumb.

1348
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,850
I did a lot.
Just.

1349
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:40,190
I don't know what you think of this 
line,

1350
00:59:40,191 --> 00:59:42,980
but I.
Woody Allen said that mentioned on stage

1351
00:59:42,981 --> 00:59:44,900
in these women started bowing.
I said,

1352
00:59:44,901 --> 00:59:46,970
why you boom?
They said because of what he did and the

1353
00:59:46,971 --> 00:59:48,350
daughter and all this.
I said,

1354
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,184
look,
I didn't know.

1355
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:51,050
I said,
but the one thing you got to admit,

1356
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,750
he really must love her because it's not
like she's hot,

1357
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,230
but that got a laugh.

1358
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,100
When we get offstage.
I'll tell you one,

1359
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,390
Tony Hinchcliffe,
snoop bit.

1360
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,050
I can't say it on stage,
but I'll tell you on stage when you tell

1361
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:10,460
me your thing onstage with Tony 
Hinchcliffe has a new bit that's fucking

1362
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:15,140
ruthless and killed me and we came up 
with it in the car this weekend.

1363
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:16,003
We're on a road trip and we were talking
about something and he said it and I 

1364
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,300
fucking died.
I say,

1365
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:22,640
you got to say that onstage.
He goes,

1366
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:23,550
seriously?
I go,

1367
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:28,280
got to say that on stage,
and he did it last night in the room.

1368
01:00:28,281 --> 01:00:30,500
Fucking exploded.
You had to come back and do the show and

1369
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:33,650
I do.
It would show his show killed Tony.

1370
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,380
I don't like to work Monday nights.
Oh yeah.

1371
01:00:36,381 --> 01:00:38,810
Well you got to have a schedule now.
You got to see the family,

1372
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,230
but I have a scheduled now on Monday,
Sunday to Monday,

1373
01:00:42,231 --> 01:00:46,070
Sunday and was Sundays and Mondays is 
extreme family time.

1374
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:46,933
I just don't do Jack Shit because you 
won't have these days and they grow up 

1375
01:00:49,581 --> 01:00:50,990
so fast.
Not to get corny,

1376
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:52,550
but it's true.
Yeah,

1377
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:53,790
it's true.
I'm,

1378
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:55,310
I'm enjoying it.
I'm.

1379
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,650
I'm happier now than I've ever been in 
my life.

1380
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,180
Good.
That's great to hear that.

1381
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,920
Yeah,
and I'm also,

1382
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:03,290
I think I'm a nicer person now that I've
ever been in my life.

1383
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,030
Wait a little bit,
way nicer.

1384
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:09,580
Huge,
much to compare with his little brick.

1385
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:12,140
What did you think?
It just makes you a,

1386
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:13,013
you know,
Dave Chappelle said this to me once and 

1387
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,750
I think it was a really great quote.
He said not only is having children made

1388
01:01:17,751 --> 01:01:18,584
me,
um,

1389
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,550
made me love someone more than I ever 
thought I could.

1390
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:25,370
It's changed my capacity for love and 
that's cool.

1391
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:26,483
Yeah,
he's like my capacity for love as much 

1392
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:29,870
greater than it.
That make sense.

1393
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:34,630
Like you realize like a lot of our 
struggles and a lot of the shit that we,

1394
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,673
we go through in this life,
it's a lot of it is about perspective 

1395
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:39,643
and a lot of it is about who's around 
you and what kind of loving environment 

1396
01:01:42,561 --> 01:01:47,561
you around.
And it's also having kids and not having

1397
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:51,200
the strain,
the financial strain,

1398
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:55,810
the emotional strain and the ignorance 
strain that my parents had.

1399
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,790
Their parents are like,
ignorance is a big thing too.

1400
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,650
Like they didn't know how to raise kids 
back then.

1401
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,930
Of course they hit us,
they,

1402
01:02:01,931 --> 01:02:02,764
you know,
they yelled at us and they didn't know 

1403
01:02:03,831 --> 01:02:05,000
me.
My mom didn't hit me,

1404
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:05,834
but you know,
it was a common thing for people hit 

1405
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:08,324
their kids.
I remember Bruce Willis said to me one 

1406
01:02:09,981 --> 01:02:12,740
time to be a named driver.
He said,

1407
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,080
you know,
one of the things about having kids,

1408
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:16,610
he goes,
there's a little girl,

1409
01:02:16,611 --> 01:02:18,600
I forget the middle little one's name.

1410
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:21,870
He said she would wake me up to walk her
to the bathroom and,

1411
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:22,733
and,
and to her I wasn't a movie star wasn't 

1412
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,013
any,
I was daddy because she's afraid of the 

1413
01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:29,004
dark.
Walking her in and he said that really 

1414
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:34,800
humanized them and made them feel good 
because you know,

1415
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:35,643
it's like you get stroked all the time.
It's like sometimes you just want to be 

1416
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:38,581
normal.
Well,

1417
01:02:38,581 --> 01:02:41,340
not only that,
when Bruce Willis was famous,

1418
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,353
there was way less famous people because
there was no famous internet 

1419
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:49,470
personalities.
There was no famous reality TV stars.

1420
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:50,453
There was way less famous rappers and 
there was way less famous comedians 

1421
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:56,160
think out.
A few famous Comedians,

1422
01:02:56,161 --> 01:03:00,840
they were like me and dice and guys that
were on Rodney specials.

1423
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:04,470
We were really fucking lucky because we 
became instant draws.

1424
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:08,040
I paid to see you after you were on 
Rodney.

1425
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:09,450
Special extra.

1426
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,283
Yeah.
I went to see you at next and I went to 

1427
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:12,564
see two nights in a row because one 
night I thought you were supposed to be 

1428
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,133
there and neither you missed your flight
or something happened and Dennis leary 

1429
01:03:18,511 --> 01:03:20,040
was there instead.
And I was like,

1430
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:20,874
what the fuck?
So we came back the next day and we saw 

1431
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:24,054
you again.
But I'm really with a girl that I was 

1432
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:27,720
dating.
Her name was Stephanie.

1433
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,573
She was,
uh,

1434
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,590
she's telling me what to do.
She was older,

1435
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:34,990
really the dominant one.
She was,

1436
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:36,480
it was the first girl.
She was 25.

1437
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:38,490
I was 21.
She's sick.

1438
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:41,430
She liked the deck though to tell you 
that woo.

1439
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:43,220
Like it would be a little.
The old lesbian.

1440
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,110
Well that was.
What was exciting about it.

1441
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,480
She's the first woman I dated,
like,

1442
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,373
you know,
she was a woman that I dated girls 

1443
01:03:51,181 --> 01:03:54,150
before that,
that girl was a woman and you know,

1444
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,510
she was fucking smart to refer girls who
are a woman's age.

1445
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:00,300
Yeah,
she was.

1446
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:01,143
I'm too intense.
She tells me what to do with standup up 

1447
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,200
to me.
A Standard Bailey's.

1448
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,530
Yeah.
It's of hilarious.

1449
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:08,383
So that Seinfeld episode where the girl 
broke up with him because of his act 

1450
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:13,800
funny.
And she goes,

1451
01:04:13,801 --> 01:04:15,600
uh,
I don't think this is going to work.

1452
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,210
He goes,
are,

1453
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:17,340
we're having a great time.
She says,

1454
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:20,290
well,
your act with the Igg ever notice?

1455
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,170
She goes,
that's not my style of comedy.

1456
01:04:22,171 --> 01:04:24,180
He goes,
you're breaking up with me because on my

1457
01:04:24,181 --> 01:04:24,781
ass.
She goes,

1458
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:27,530
yes,
I am as the end.

1459
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,680
That's hilarious.
Well,

1460
01:04:28,681 --> 01:04:31,920
if you were a girl and you were a huge 
comedy fan,

1461
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,190
I could imagine if you were a girl and 
you just,

1462
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,233
you love Chappelle and pill burden and 
dom irrera and Duncan trussell and Joey 

1463
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:42,953
Diaz and all these great comedians,
and then you start dating a prop act 

1464
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,420
anyway,
and he's the worst prop act.

1465
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:50,160
Yeah.
It's like fucking stupid.

1466
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:51,990
He's got a soundtrack,
he has to play,

1467
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:52,913
hit the music,
fucking dropped down and comes up with 

1468
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:59,580
an album jokes and sophie told me that 
she would,

1469
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:01,260
she couldn't go out with me if she 
didn't like my.

1470
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:02,810
That makes sense.
Yeah.

1471
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,650
Yeah.
If you're a comedy fan of me,

1472
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:05,484
if you're a music fan,
how the fuck would you date a guy who's 

1473
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:08,580
got terrible songs?
Yeah.

1474
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,220
How could you be brought,
you know,

1475
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:13,380
if you're a,
a bad accountant,

1476
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,210
you know,
but you're a great guy.

1477
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:16,230
Probably still get a date.

1478
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,063
You know what,
if you're a fucking terrible to thing 

1479
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:23,860
that someone loves.
Right.

1480
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,250
Well that's so much more personal than 
the debits and credits.

1481
01:05:27,251 --> 01:05:28,084
You know,
it's like you're standing up as you are 

1482
01:05:29,761 --> 01:05:31,990
a reflection of you generally.
I mean,

1483
01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:35,170
if a good shit good stand up is one of 
the most personal things.

1484
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:39,490
I think music stand up.
Maybe writing.

1485
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,960
Writing's pretty personal.
Yeah.

1486
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:42,913
Yeah.
But stand up really good ups or reveal 

1487
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:45,754
something of themselves.
You feel like you know them for 

1488
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:49,960
something to relate to the brochure.
Yeah.

1489
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:51,791
Yeah.
It's,

1490
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:52,624
um,
I mean there's more famous standups 

1491
01:05:54,191 --> 01:05:57,580
today.
I was talking with Jeff Wills from a lot

1492
01:05:57,581 --> 01:05:58,440
and I know Jeff.
Yeah.

1493
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:03,630
Jeff and I were talking about the number
of guys today and gals that can sell out

1494
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:08,950
big ass theaters and it's nuts.
He's like,

1495
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:11,170
dude,
20 years ago there was nobody,

1496
01:06:11,171 --> 01:06:12,520
there was like a handful.

1497
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,390
Everybody worked at clubs and there was 
a few George Carlin's out there,

1498
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:17,853
you know,
a few Chris Rock's or whoever it was at 

1499
01:06:20,831 --> 01:06:24,310
the time that could sell out a theater 
and now like,

1500
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,140
fucking everybody's selling out these 
theaters.

1501
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:28,210
It's crazy.
They have the right social media,

1502
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,550
social media.
Um,

1503
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:32,770
but they still have to have an act 
because they'll sell out once,

1504
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:34,540
maybe twice,
but then then it's done.

1505
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:37,590
I what have one,
a lot of those people from that.

1506
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:40,090
Let's stand up.
Competition show.

1507
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,610
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1508
01:06:41,611 --> 01:06:42,230
yeah,
yeah.

1509
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:43,610
Um,
last comic standing.

1510
01:06:43,611 --> 01:06:45,550
Yeah.
They went around once than the ones that

1511
01:06:45,551 --> 01:06:47,110
were good.
Like Alonzo Bowden.

1512
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,003
Eliza.
Eliza is probably the most successful 

1513
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,490
out of that group.
Yeah,

1514
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:55,690
she's done more.
I think she's had more specials.

1515
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:57,730
She'd see sells out everywhere.
She does.

1516
01:06:57,731 --> 01:06:58,564
Good size theaters,
she's selling out or she just sold out 

1517
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:01,293
our whole tour.

1518
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,820
She probably has the most success.
She works hard.

1519
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:04,743
She does work hard.
That girl kicks ass like she doesn't 

1520
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:07,264
fuck around.
She told me something so funny when she 

1521
01:07:08,621 --> 01:07:10,890
was on my podcast and have you heard 
this?

1522
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:14,020
When Jamie still did it and she goes,
I have a great body,

1523
01:07:14,021 --> 01:07:16,920
you know,
kits with sweatpants.

1524
01:07:16,921 --> 01:07:19,000
So I don't think it will.
I know.

1525
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,880
I don't know.
She didn't show it for God's sakes.

1526
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:22,890
Wear a skirt.
I Dunno.

1527
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:25,540
And she'd tell you you're some piece of 
shit for asking to show,

1528
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,170
but I don't know what to tell her.
Like,

1529
01:07:27,171 --> 01:07:28,600
you know,
well she's funny.

1530
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,520
She's,
she's an aggressive girl.

1531
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:31,683
When she was on my podcast,
it's the fucking comments were 

1532
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:37,930
hilarious.
Like men either love her or they fucking

1533
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:41,410
hate her.
Like I've heard the thumbs up,

1534
01:07:41,411 --> 01:07:45,280
the thumbs down versus Eliza,
like I'm on the podcast have thumbs up,

1535
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,270
thumbs down.

1536
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,103
She got like one of the worst ratios of 
any button that's ever been on the 

1537
01:07:49,601 --> 01:07:50,410
podcast.
Really?

1538
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:51,700
Yeah.
I enjoyed it.

1539
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,680
I enjoyed talking to her.
I like her.

1540
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:59,250
I'm not threatened by confident.
I would say cocky women doesn't threaten

1541
01:07:59,861 --> 01:08:02,110
me,
but for a lot because I'm not threatened

1542
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:03,310
by confident,
cocky man.

1543
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:06,550
I'm around them all the time.
Of course it doesn't bother me.

1544
01:08:06,551 --> 01:08:10,060
I don't judge you by it.
I maybe I feel like it's silly sometimes

1545
01:08:10,061 --> 01:08:12,150
with some people if they're too 
confident,

1546
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,710
too cocky or they're too dismissive of 
other people.

1547
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:17,210
I think it's silly,
but I don't get mad at it.

1548
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:20,240
I would have when I was younger,
when I was younger,

1549
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,313
uh,
someone that was like cocky or 

1550
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:26,540
overconfident or just,
you know,

1551
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:31,541
just I would just feel threatened by it 
or be upset by it or a judge them,

1552
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,043
you know,
in a weird way to connect all my own 

1553
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,030
shit to them get upset at them.

1554
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:39,110
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

1555
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,680
I know.
I definitely,

1556
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,010
I definitely have trouble with attitude 
thinking,

1557
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,010
you know,
lucky or,

1558
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:46,873
you know,
lucky we are to be in this fucking 

1559
01:08:48,461 --> 01:08:50,030
money.
It looks like to work.

1560
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:51,410
Well,
one of the things about you,

1561
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,293
dom,
you're always super supportive of young 

1562
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:54,734
guys and girls to.
You've always been like real supportive 

1563
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,420
of,
uh,

1564
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:01,940
you know,
I think you should be,

1565
01:09:01,941 --> 01:09:03,110
you know,
I think so too.

1566
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:05,270
I've learned a lot of that from you.
Oh,

1567
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:06,163
cool man.
Let's thinking about tiffany because 

1568
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,230
tiffany means a lot to me.
You know,

1569
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:14,110
I taught her at a comedy camp when she 
was a teenager and I've seen it.

1570
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:16,430
I've seen it through a bunch of 
struggles,

1571
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:17,264
you know,
crazy lost their homes and she kept 

1572
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:22,430
trying to keep her family together.
So I had another podcast and she said,

1573
01:09:22,431 --> 01:09:24,350
you know,
she was sent back in the day.

1574
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,850
She goes,
I wanted to fuck you.

1575
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:28,220
I said,
I said,

1576
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,280
first of all,
tiffany,

1577
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:30,173
you like a god daughter to me.
It never crossed my mind and it really 

1578
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:34,460
didn't even know.
I think she's a beautiful girl.

1579
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:35,863
And I said,
the second thing is I never take my 

1580
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:38,210
pants in front of you.
I said,

1581
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:40,070
no,
this is beautiful black girl going,

1582
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:41,480
you call it added Dick.

1583
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:48,650
That's my biggest fear.
It's funny watching her blow up.

1584
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:50,173
She's hilarious.
And she took to it like a duck to water 

1585
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:54,380
men like immediately confidence.
Oh,

1586
01:09:54,381 --> 01:09:56,730
she's got massive confidence,
but immediately,

1587
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:57,613
like,
almost like she feels like that's where 

1588
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:01,860
she was always meant to be.
Oh,

1589
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:03,620
because he's just waiting for the bell 
to ring.

1590
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:06,230
No,
when she did call bare,

1591
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:08,150
honest to God,
I'm sitting there crying.

1592
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:12,310
I swear finding happiness.
So that's awesome.

1593
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,790
The jealousy.
I was catching it on the show and I,

1594
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:18,650
I love cold bear.
He doesn't even return my call.

1595
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:22,460
I've got trump jokes too.
It's all that show is these days.

1596
01:10:22,461 --> 01:10:24,180
Right?
I don't think it'd be on the airports if

1597
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,030
trump.
It would be on the air.

1598
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:26,893
I don't know.
Joe.

1599
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:27,980
They were dying.
They were,

1600
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:31,580
they were way behind the Nielsen ratings
all of a sudden,

1601
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:32,970
but they were behind.
Right.

1602
01:10:32,971 --> 01:10:34,520
Are Way behind.
Then he went for it.

1603
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:35,413
Yeah.
When he called the president's mouth 

1604
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:39,350
Putin's cock holster.
I was like,

1605
01:10:39,351 --> 01:10:40,184
Holy Shit,
I can't believe he said that on the 

1606
01:10:41,881 --> 01:10:43,070
head.
You didn't hear that?

1607
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:43,904
No.
He went on this epic rant about trump 

1608
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,520
and then,
uh,

1609
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:49,790
he said something about his mouth being 
Putin's cock holster.

1610
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:52,160
And I just.
And they beeped out cock,

1611
01:10:52,161 --> 01:10:54,800
obviously pretty obvious what he said,
but I'm sitting there going,

1612
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:58,010
what is going on with late night tv?
Well,

1613
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:00,350
I kimball's been on a run lately,
uh,

1614
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,340
crying and crying.

1615
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,530
I think it breaks down like every night 
now.

1616
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,940
It's really good for ratings.
He's a sensitive guy.

1617
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:12,680
Good way to cut to commercial.
He's a legitimately sensitive guy.

1618
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,180
Very nice guy.
Like Jimmy Kimmel is a very,

1619
01:11:15,181 --> 01:11:17,140
very good person.
I key.

1620
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:17,983
He's a genuine,
nice guy with a real heart in it really 

1621
01:11:19,981 --> 01:11:21,630
does care.
You know.

1622
01:11:21,631 --> 01:11:24,150
I remember he cried after the Vegas 
Shooting and he's from Vegas.

1623
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,610
Did he cry recently?
Was it the school shooting?

1624
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,100
But that was brutal though.
She's fucking,

1625
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:29,973
the Shit I go out with was there that 
night and she was at the trop and then 

1626
01:11:33,511 --> 01:11:35,350
all the people came running down into 
the truck.

1627
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:39,340
So New Year's Eve.
I'm with Vegas shooter.

1628
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:40,650
Yeah.
People,

1629
01:11:40,651 --> 01:11:41,484
they had to stay there for hours.
They had everything under lock down 

1630
01:11:43,141 --> 01:11:44,730
because they didn't know who had guns 
and who didn't.

1631
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:46,500
They didn't know it with one person or 
50 people.

1632
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:50,440
And she's there.
She's at the trop and uh,

1633
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:51,413
she got kind of traumatized by it,
so new year's Eve were walking outside 

1634
01:11:54,841 --> 01:11:58,800
and all of a sudden she starts shaking 
and she was having an anxiety attack,

1635
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:00,510
you know,
about being in a crowd.

1636
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:01,733
So I was just fucking,
we're trying to make her laugh and say 

1637
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,360
don't worry about it.
And then we're in the fireworks.

1638
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,530
That's all I really care about is 
fireworks.

1639
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:10,760
And he took that away from me because 
you're selfish and Felix,

1640
01:12:10,761 --> 01:12:12,220
you know,
but,

1641
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:16,260
but I got her laugh in any way.
The fucking,

1642
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,450
the,
the volume of them.

1643
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:20,003
It's just,
it seems like every couple months or 

1644
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:22,800
some new one.
Remember when Columbine,

1645
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:25,350
we thought this is terrible.
It's won't happen again.

1646
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:27,150
Again.
It's like there's so many now,

1647
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,980
you know,
you get used to it,

1648
01:12:28,981 --> 01:12:30,390
which has said,
yeah,

1649
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:33,540
it's fucking crazy.
And I don't know what the answer is.

1650
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,823
You know,
I don't know if it's a tighter gun 

1651
01:12:36,871 --> 01:12:37,704
control.
I don't know if that would stop them 

1652
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:41,910
because it would just make it more 
difficult to get guns,

1653
01:12:41,911 --> 01:12:44,970
but would that be enough?
But we're not doing anything.

1654
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,830
Well,
the interesting thing to try something,

1655
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:47,733
I don't know what to do.
I'm in and there's also the number of 

1656
01:12:49,981 --> 01:12:51,800
people that are on psychiatric 
medication.

1657
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:53,160
It's fucking crazy.
Well,

1658
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:55,890
I think that for the [inaudible] or 
whatever they are,

1659
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,050
they share sold.
They shouldn't be.

1660
01:12:58,051 --> 01:13:01,710
I mean,
we really need that to kill a pheasant.

1661
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,460
It's not a a hunting gun really.
You're the guy who designed them,

1662
01:13:05,461 --> 01:13:07,790
said he made it for war.
Yeah.

1663
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,633
The real real

1664
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:13,170
for hunting are usually usually bolt 
action rifles,

1665
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,033
which means you have around.
You have usually two or three in the 

1666
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:21,570
magazine.
You have a couple or one in the chamber.

1667
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:23,010
You put it in there,
cheeky,

1668
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:23,844
lock it in place.
The clamp it down and you fire a shot 

1669
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,870
and then you have to bolted again.
You have to use the.

1670
01:13:30,871 --> 01:13:31,704
The action again.
The shell pops out and another one goes 

1671
01:13:34,021 --> 01:13:35,370
in,
bolt that down,

1672
01:13:35,371 --> 01:13:38,220
and then you get another shot.
It's a very slow thing.

1673
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,270
It takes a couple of Musket,
whereas these are like tack,

1674
01:13:42,271 --> 01:13:43,104
tack,
tack tack,

1675
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:46,290
or with the bump stocks.
They apparently,

1676
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:48,810
the president wants a ban bump stocks 
with a bump.

1677
01:13:48,811 --> 01:13:50,190
Stock is,
Oh yeah,

1678
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:55,550
it's a stock where you pull back on it 
and apparently you push forward and pull

1679
01:13:56,221 --> 01:13:57,830
back at the same time.
Uh,

1680
01:13:57,940 --> 01:13:58,773
I might be fucking this up,
but the thing is the stock makes the 

1681
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,340
trigger go like that,
that,

1682
01:14:03,341 --> 01:14:03,571
that,
that,

1683
01:14:03,571 --> 01:14:03,831
that,
that,

1684
01:14:03,831 --> 01:14:04,231
that,
that,

1685
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,064
that,
where it's almost like an automatic 

1686
01:14:05,761 --> 01:14:09,450
weapon and trump just decided to ban 
those.

1687
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,000
And there's a lot of people that are up 
in arms about him banning those,

1688
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,000
like these,
the gun rights people don't want to lose

1689
01:14:16,001 --> 01:14:17,740
anything.
They don't want to lose any rights.

1690
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,040
They don't want to lose any fucking 
crazy ass weapons.

1691
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:22,173
They think that any slip is a,
is eventually going to lead to them 

1692
01:14:26,351 --> 01:14:27,184
getting their guns taken away.
Like I follow a bunch of NRA people and 

1693
01:14:30,281 --> 01:14:33,100
gun people on twitter and instagram and 
take their guns away.

1694
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,830
They think they are.
They think they are.

1695
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,750
I mean,
I agree with you.

1696
01:14:37,751 --> 01:14:39,520
I don't think that's ever going to come 
to that.

1697
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:43,480
But the idea that tighter regulation is 
bad.

1698
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,340
I don't think that's true.
I think,

1699
01:14:45,341 --> 01:14:46,174
uh,
I think first of all you should have to 

1700
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:51,020
go through some sort of examination.
If you can go through exam,

1701
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:54,220
you don't,
you can't drive a fucking car unless you

1702
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:56,080
prove that you know how to operate a 
car.

1703
01:14:56,110 --> 01:14:58,150
Like someone has to be there with you.
That's an expert.

1704
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,960
So driving expert watches you,
they watch.

1705
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:03,520
Make sure you know what to do.
What do you do here at this light?

1706
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,250
Do you know how to hit the brakes?
Do stop perfectly.

1707
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:10,300
Do you look left and right before you 
turn all that shit is super important.

1708
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:11,980
If you want to drive,
how the fuck is it?

1709
01:15:11,981 --> 01:15:15,190
Not Super Important.
If you operate a goddamn firearm,

1710
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,430
I know I don't understand like the kid 
who bought the,

1711
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,020
I think the kid who did the,
uh,

1712
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:25,960
latest shooting in Florida,
I think it was two stories together.

1713
01:15:25,961 --> 01:15:26,794
I don't know,
but apparently he was under age and had 

1714
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:31,300
fake id and still was able to buy it.
I don't know,

1715
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:32,750
I didn't read that story.
That'd be,

1716
01:15:32,751 --> 01:15:34,450
you know,
I avoided the story.

1717
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:37,540
I saw the kid's face and I saw the,
it's fucking insane.

1718
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:38,373
And you hear all the stories about kids 
that were saying that they knew that 

1719
01:15:40,061 --> 01:15:42,550
this kid was going to be a school 
shooter anyway,

1720
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:47,040
they were saying in the past.
And then one of the things he wrote it,

1721
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:47,874
wrote it on facebook or something that 
he wants to be a professional school 

1722
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:51,484
shooter.
And then two years later and he got 

1723
01:15:54,761 --> 01:15:55,594
visited by the FBI,
the FBI actually checked this fucking 

1724
01:15:58,151 --> 01:15:59,470
kid out.
Talk to him about it,

1725
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:00,323
decided he wasn't a threat.
How do you decide someone's a threat or 

1726
01:16:02,381 --> 01:16:03,490
not a threat?
Well,

1727
01:16:03,491 --> 01:16:05,050
if you're talking to them,
they were a threat.

1728
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,690
I mean,
they may be.

1729
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:10,480
I can't talk to everybody,
but I would be suspicious of anyone that

1730
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:13,450
it took that much energy to go find it.
How did they find them?

1731
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,200
Why would they,
why would they even question them?

1732
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:16,853
Um,
I think people were saying that he's a 

1733
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:19,330
fucking psychopath.

1734
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:23,800
It hurts.
It's just sad.

1735
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,790
It's just fucking sad that it's sad that
anyone could do that.

1736
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:28,624
It's sad that anyone would be hurting 
and so fucked up that you can take a 

1737
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:33,520
child.
Imagine you have a kid,

1738
01:16:33,521 --> 01:16:35,410
right?
You got a little dom,

1739
01:16:35,411 --> 01:16:36,244
irrera,
little tiny baby and he's just a cute 

1740
01:16:37,841 --> 01:16:38,674
little fellow,
little tiny baby and they don't know 

1741
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:44,641
anything that would tickle him and then 
from there one day that becomes a school

1742
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:46,624
shooter.
That's what people have to take into 

1743
01:16:48,281 --> 01:16:49,114
consideration that this boy,
this 19 year old boy who did that was a 

1744
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:57,691
baby at one point in time.
He's a failed process of failed product,

1745
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:02,410
whether it's through his environment,
his family,

1746
01:17:02,411 --> 01:17:04,240
his DNA,
all the above,

1747
01:17:04,241 --> 01:17:06,460
his life experiences,
all the pain,

1748
01:17:06,461 --> 01:17:08,320
the trauma,
mental illness,

1749
01:17:08,321 --> 01:17:09,980
all these various factors,
but

1750
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:10,813
that used to be a baby.
Probably the cutest little fucker 

1751
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:13,543
probably hold them and cuddle and we'd 
go to sleep in your arms and one of the 

1752
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:23,120
things is changed with me since and it 
changes a little bit every day.

1753
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:23,954
I feel like every day I just get a 
little bit more compassionate and more 

1754
01:17:27,051 --> 01:17:30,350
understanding and I work towards it.
It's something I really think about,

1755
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:31,963
but having children,
I think of people as they used to be a 

1756
01:17:36,531 --> 01:17:38,020
child,
he has to be a baby.

1757
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:38,854
I think of that with the homeless people
in there and they're all those blankets 

1758
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:44,180
and stuff.
I think this was born at.

1759
01:17:44,181 --> 01:17:46,530
This person was born into somebody.
Yeah.

1760
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:47,403
No,
I was thinking that the other day I was 

1761
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:48,974
at coffee bean and I knew homeless guy 
was there from the smell that was 

1762
01:17:53,061 --> 01:17:55,690
pouring cream in my coffee.
I witnessed,

1763
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,553
smelled them jail.

1764
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,531
He wouldn't have.
Right.

1765
01:17:57,531 --> 01:17:59,280
You were just talking about the hit 
before the podcast.

1766
01:17:59,281 --> 01:18:01,840
Your sense of smell is no good.
So good.

1767
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:04,970
Anyway,
the guy smelled so bad that,

1768
01:18:04,971 --> 01:18:07,400
um,
he was dressed fairly normal.

1769
01:18:07,401 --> 01:18:09,870
He wasn't disgustingly dressed.
I had to look at them to,

1770
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,450
to,
to recognize like,

1771
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,770
oh,
this guy's homeless.

1772
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,760
I looked over and he just fucking stunk.
It was rough.

1773
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:17,653
I mean he just stunk and I looked over 
and the guy sitting there with his head 

1774
01:18:20,301 --> 01:18:25,301
in his hands like this,
like he's probably just full of terrible

1775
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:30,020
anxiety or thoughts or depression or 
whatever it was,

1776
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:32,780
but all I was thinking that important 
cream in my coffee.

1777
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:34,040
It's like that when someone's a little 
boy,

1778
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,070
I know someone's a little boy and now 
here he is.

1779
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:41,840
He looks like he's in his sixties and 
he's all fucked up and smells like shit.

1780
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:42,893
He's sitting there and this coffee bean 
and he's sitting by himself with his 

1781
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:48,100
head in his hands and everyone's 
avoiding him.

1782
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:52,240
I'll just moving around him and yeah,
if you think of life like that,

1783
01:18:52,241 --> 01:18:55,280
they think of people like that.
It's easier to be humanized.

1784
01:18:55,281 --> 01:18:56,114
Yes.
I like we were talking about Louis and 

1785
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:58,693
nothing like Louis again,
but this kid that was working the 

1786
01:19:00,951 --> 01:19:01,784
brokerage and a in Long Island and he 
comes in with his mom to see me and he 

1787
01:19:07,131 --> 01:19:07,964
said,
I don't think what Louis did was that 

1788
01:19:08,931 --> 01:19:10,370
bad.
They didn't rape her or anything.

1789
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:11,204
I said,
well,

1790
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,860
it would be better if he did it to your 
sister.

1791
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,090
He goes,
I'd fucking kill him.

1792
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,290
I said,
well,

1793
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:17,900
that should tell you something that you 
shouldn't kill him for that,

1794
01:19:17,901 --> 01:19:20,660
but you know,
it bothers you enough.

1795
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:24,140
That's somebody else's sister know.
And you know,

1796
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:27,640
Louis apologized and I'm not trying to 
jump on him again,

1797
01:19:27,641 --> 01:19:30,830
but I mean you got to know how you'd 
feel about it when it was personal.

1798
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:32,930
Yeah.
Well,

1799
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:36,350
the Louis One's so weird.
It's very weird.

1800
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,353
So we're just.
Whenever it's not like you're with 

1801
01:19:38,631 --> 01:19:39,464
someone and you're making out and you 
pull your dick out and she grabs it and 

1802
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:48,590
not getting hard over here.
I mean this is,

1803
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:53,630
this is not the.
Not In the act of intimacy.

1804
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:55,850
It's just touching.
There's nothing.

1805
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:59,180
Not even verbal abuse.
The only touch with yourself.

1806
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:00,883
Maybe there's oral abuse,
like as in sound like maybe you made 

1807
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:04,783
weird noises.

1808
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,453
You make that face to camera.
I wonder how many people make a ric 

1809
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:21,250
flair when they come?
What's that?

1810
01:20:21,370 --> 01:20:23,600
You know when Rick Flair.
Woo.

1811
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:24,630
Do you remember Rick Flair?

1812
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:28,600
You're talking to the Rolex wearing 
diamond rank?

1813
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,490
Wearing jet flying.
Oh,

1814
01:20:30,491 --> 01:20:31,780
he's the limousine riding.

1815
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:32,910
He's a fighter.
No,

1816
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,530
he's a pro wrestler.
Oh,

1817
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:35,760
that's what I meant.
Yeah,

1818
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:36,500
yeah,
yeah.

1819
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,870
It's fucking just.
He is a.

1820
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:43,490
he's an American iconic character.
Not just a progress,

1821
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:44,523
like an American icon icon,
but Tuesday where I'll talk about rick 

1822
01:20:47,671 --> 01:20:48,504
flare onstage and point the microphone 
and the audience and the audience just 

1823
01:20:50,881 --> 01:20:55,290
goes,
who is the nature boy?

1824
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,270
Ric flair.
I don't remember him.

1825
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,820
Who is the guy that Mohammed Ali,
he modeled his.

1826
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,370
Was a gorgeous George.
He modeled his.

1827
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,293
Yeah,
he gave credit to this guy that's 

1828
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,600
professional wrestler.
Oh,

1829
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:09,270
no kidding.
That's interesting.

1830
01:21:09,271 --> 01:21:10,920
I think it was gorgeous.
George couldn't be.

1831
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:14,490
There was a lot of those guys back then.
Remember you remember killer Kowalski?

1832
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:15,643
Abraham?
Yes.

1833
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,490
The claw.
Grab your head.

1834
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:21,300
Remember who was the one that cocoa but 
the Bobo Bobo,

1835
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:23,430
Brazil,
Brazil to the.

1836
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:24,480
Uh,
and uh,

1837
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:28,590
there was a Bruno San Martino Martino.

1838
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:30,660
Interesting.
It was a world champion.

1839
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,553
How Mohammed Ali's fascination with 
progressing fueled his career inspired 

1840
01:21:34,621 --> 01:21:35,880
mma.
Interesting.

1841
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:38,340
Gorgeous.
George was crazy.

1842
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,333
Was Gorgeous.
George.

1843
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,420
Interesting was the stupid ad you have 
to watch for the Olympics there.

1844
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:45,720
Boy,
I'm.

1845
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:49,020
This Olympics is.
I think I'm going to say this.

1846
01:21:49,021 --> 01:21:49,854
I think the Olympics are gross.
This is why I think the Olympics are 

1847
01:21:53,111 --> 01:21:54,810
gross.
I think it's a great opportunity for all

1848
01:21:54,811 --> 01:21:55,644
those athletes.
I think it's great for people to watch 

1849
01:21:56,821 --> 01:21:57,654
it,
but I think it is a fucking disgusting 

1850
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:02,370
money grab and all those amateur air 
quotes.

1851
01:22:02,371 --> 01:22:03,204
Athletes don't get paid shit.
And these companies are making billions 

1852
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,480
and billions of dollars off of them and 
I really wish they would all quit.

1853
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:12,150
I really wish they would say,
fuck you pay me.

1854
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:16,410
I really wish they would just go 
straight ray Liotta they give you pain.

1855
01:22:16,411 --> 01:22:17,670
Me,
they get up there.

1856
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,860
They're youth for that.
Not only that,

1857
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:23,040
the fucking companies,
they're so restrictive,

1858
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:23,993
the IOC and all the people that are 
behind it are so restrictive and they 

1859
01:22:27,871 --> 01:22:32,670
are making ungodly sums of money,
ungodly contracts.

1860
01:22:32,671 --> 01:22:35,700
They're just giant contracts to air the 
the Olympics.

1861
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:36,863
Giant amounts of money to build these 
stadiums and set up these are these 

1862
01:22:40,111 --> 01:22:44,130
events and that everything is about net 
nationalism and national pride.

1863
01:22:44,131 --> 01:22:47,100
Whether it's in Korea or Russia or 
wherever the fuck they do them.

1864
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,160
But meanwhile the athletes don't get 
dick.

1865
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:51,143
They don't get Dick.
If you're lucky and you're Michael 

1866
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:54,210
Phelps,
he become famous out of it and you get a

1867
01:22:54,211 --> 01:22:55,044
bunch of commercials,
commercials and endorsements and you 

1868
01:22:57,121 --> 01:23:00,360
make a shit load of money that way.
But how many Michael Phelps is are there

1869
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:02,520
was a three or four.
I mean how many,

1870
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:03,540
but how many in the.
All the.

1871
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:04,920
All the Olympics in adult.

1872
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,310
All the Olympics.
Jamie,

1873
01:23:06,311 --> 01:23:08,860
you're a sports fan and all the 
Olympics.

1874
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,240
Say like the Olympics this year.
Well,

1875
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,470
let's go the last one.
Who the fuck came out of it?

1876
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:19,000
Where they're a household name right now
you've got shaun white and maybe I heard

1877
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:20,380
of that guy.
That girl that won.

1878
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:21,713
Kim is her last name is the border 
bronze last night or two nights before 

1879
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,690
the real famous.
There's Lindsey Vonn.

1880
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:30,980
She's very famous.
She's very famous and she.

1881
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:33,940
She used to date tiger woods that made 
her famous two plus.

1882
01:23:33,941 --> 01:23:37,020
She's hot.
That makes her famous shit.

1883
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:38,620
Interesting names.
So I helped her.

1884
01:23:38,621 --> 01:23:40,990
She was a gold medal winner I believe.
How many other ones are there?

1885
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:43,720
So few.
I mean it's just like a handful.

1886
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:45,910
They can build a story around someone 
then they can sell the story,

1887
01:23:45,911 --> 01:23:48,610
but.
But when you get to the point where it's

1888
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,650
worthwhile to sacrifice your entire life
and it actually pays off,

1889
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,090
what are the,
what are the odds?

1890
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:55,923
It's so fucking small,
but meanwhile people are tuning in to 

1891
01:23:59,321 --> 01:24:00,154
all of it,
the making massive amounts of revenue 

1892
01:24:02,381 --> 01:24:05,320
from all of it and they're not sharing 
it with the athletes at all.

1893
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,290
I think it's fucking gross.
They pretend it's amateur.

1894
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:12,580
The tenants and amateur.
It's a Goddamn motherfucking business.

1895
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:15,900
That's what the Olympics are.
Sensible college business.

1896
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,240
You can't basketball and football.
Really?

1897
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,433
NCAA says student athletes shouldn't be 
paid because the 13th amendment allows 

1898
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:28,270
unpaid prison labor.
What the fuck?

1899
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:29,320
Oh,
that's Shaun King.

1900
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:32,440
This is a.
This is another article.

1901
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:34,450
Well,
the main one going around,

1902
01:24:34,451 --> 01:24:36,440
but there's a.
that's crazy.

1903
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:38,350
Didn't really say that.
Did they really say that?

1904
01:24:38,351 --> 01:24:42,400
The 13th amendment which allows unpaid 
prison labor decided in a lawsuit,

1905
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,520
a response to a motion to dismiss.
That's what they use is.

1906
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,250
It's so disgusting.
They're so disgusting.

1907
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:52,270
They're the same to me.
Ncaa College football and basketball.

1908
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:55,120
Same thing to me.
They have 100,000 people.

1909
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:56,980
Yeah,
fuck you pay those guys,

1910
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,360
pay them,
pay those girls,

1911
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:00,610
pay all those athletes.
You're making money.

1912
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:03,100
You're making money and you're not 
sharing it with the athletes.

1913
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:06,010
They might as well be slaves.
They might as well be fucking prisoners,

1914
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:08,410
the Olympics,
Ncaa,

1915
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,510
all that shit.
It's just these.

1916
01:25:10,511 --> 01:25:11,344
No Way.
There's no way you could do that fresh 

1917
01:25:14,471 --> 01:25:15,304
today if you started from scratch today.
Instead we're going to go make billions 

1918
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,200
of dollars and we're gonna give you,
Uhm,

1919
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,083
got gunshow ghoul.
There's no way you could never do 

1920
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:26,853
occasion.
Imagine if they did that with the 

1921
01:25:27,941 --> 01:25:29,050
Olympics today.
They said,

1922
01:25:29,051 --> 01:25:30,430
look,
we're going to spend billions of dollars

1923
01:25:30,431 --> 01:25:31,870
and the athletes,
what are they going to pay?

1924
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,730
Oh,
we're not going to pay them shit.

1925
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,040
They don't get anything.
You're making any money.

1926
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,480
You're fucked.
You're out.

1927
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:39,380
I used to be that you made money.

1928
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:42,260
You're out.
But now they let basketball players play

1929
01:25:42,261 --> 01:25:43,094
in the Olympics.
They liked the NBA players because I 

1930
01:25:45,021 --> 01:25:48,670
think it was Russia was,
was getting close and beat and they beat

1931
01:25:48,671 --> 01:25:51,400
us once 72 I think.
Oh,

1932
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:54,040
is that what it was?
They started thinking about it.

1933
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:55,960
Then when they were,
they were catching up,

1934
01:25:55,961 --> 01:25:58,270
the European players were catching up.
They go,

1935
01:25:58,271 --> 01:26:00,130
fuck this.
We're going to send over a brother's.

1936
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,113
NBC Sports is about to make one point 
$4,000,000,000 in 22 days thanks to 

1937
01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:08,270
super superbowl in the limiter Olympics.
Okay.

1938
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:10,910
The superbowl,
at least his professional athletes,

1939
01:26:10,911 --> 01:26:12,620
I get paid.
They get paid.

1940
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:15,110
Whether they get paid enough is up for 
debate.

1941
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:18,860
I get that.
But the Olympics,

1942
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:19,723
they're not getting paid dick and it's 
fucking gross and it makes me angry and 

1943
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:25,430
it's one of the reasons why I don't 
watch the Olympics.

1944
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:26,323
I get mad at it.

1945
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:27,603
You know,
I wanted to be in the Olympics at one 

1946
01:26:28,281 --> 01:26:30,980
point in time to play.
I wanted to be in the back window.

1947
01:26:30,981 --> 01:26:32,900
Was being introduced the Olympics in 
1988.

1948
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,063
I tried out for the national team.
I got into like the quarter finals in 

1949
01:26:36,471 --> 01:26:39,590
Miami.
I won three fights and it was,

1950
01:26:39,591 --> 01:26:41,960
um,
that was the last,

1951
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,380
like my,
my last,

1952
01:26:44,381 --> 01:26:45,214
uh,
my really last fascination with 

1953
01:26:48,321 --> 01:26:50,200
taekwondo had kind of given up on 
taekwondo.

1954
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,073
Really before it,
I'd started kickboxing ready and I 

1955
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:56,770
realized the limitations of taekwondo.
What is that?

1956
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:59,390
The,
the hands punching to the face.

1957
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,830
Taekwondo window.
You don't punch the face.

1958
01:27:00,831 --> 01:27:03,290
He punched the body and you kick to the 
face and kick to the body,

1959
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:04,850
which is the.
Yeah,

1960
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:05,684
it's a very different thing because it's
so easy to punch someone in the face 

1961
01:27:08,811 --> 01:27:11,330
comparatively and so hard to kick 
someone in the face,

1962
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:14,600
so the,
the dexterity of the legs,

1963
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:15,434
like for people that know how to kick,
it's just you develop much more leg 

1964
01:27:18,891 --> 01:27:22,490
dexterity and you get way better at 
kicking and moving your legs,

1965
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:27,970
but as soon as you fight a good boxer,
you realize how poor the.

1966
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,353
Like the balances between your hands and
your feet and I had a really develop my 

1967
01:27:31,851 --> 01:27:36,560
hand techniques and so I was really 
concentrating on boxing at that point in

1968
01:27:36,561 --> 01:27:37,394
my life.
Like really learning how to box and 

1969
01:27:38,601 --> 01:27:39,434
learning how to punch correctly and 
learning how to put kicks together with 

1970
01:27:42,171 --> 01:27:43,004
punches because you just.
There's a bunch of stuff that you can 

1971
01:27:44,691 --> 01:27:45,524
get away with if someone's not punching 
you in the face that you can't get away 

1972
01:27:48,141 --> 01:27:49,610
with.
As soon as they start doing it.

1973
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:52,280
And I was already kind of disillusioned 
because I was learning.

1974
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:53,593
I was just learning that.
It was a very flawed and then I started 

1975
01:27:55,071 --> 01:27:59,780
doing more tie with leg kicks and I 
realized like when Jesus Christ,

1976
01:27:59,781 --> 01:28:01,940
like as soon as you kick the legs like 
this,

1977
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:04,320
most of this shit's out the window.
Right?

1978
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:05,810
It changes.
What's a,

1979
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,850
what you can and can't get away with.

1980
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,510
What do you think is the most lethal 
martial arts,

1981
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:15,570
the best martial art to learn for 
someone for self defense or even plating

1982
01:28:15,571 --> 01:28:16,600
them,
put them in the fight.

1983
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:21,410
It's hard to beat wrestling because 
wrestling you dictate whether or not the

1984
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:24,340
fight stays or goes to the ground.
We're wrestling is like,

1985
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:25,880
in my opinion,
the best base,

1986
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:30,050
but once you.
Once you've passed that,

1987
01:28:30,051 --> 01:28:30,884
then it's about submissions,
so it's wrestling and then submissions 

1988
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:34,213
because if a guy has wrestling,
he can take you to the ground and punch 

1989
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:36,824
in the face and stuff like that,
but if the guy on the bottom is good at 

1990
01:28:39,261 --> 01:28:40,094
Jujitsu,
he might still be able to submit you 

1991
01:28:41,031 --> 01:28:41,864
like the early ufc days hoists gracie 
submitted much larger people like Dan 

1992
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:45,823
Severn off of his back and Dan Severn 
was a real world class wrestler at the 

1993
01:28:48,951 --> 01:28:49,784
time and the hoists submitted them off 
his back with a Jujitsu because he 

1994
01:28:52,641 --> 01:28:55,640
didn't know Jujitsu,
so I think wrestling,

1995
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:58,010
the ability to take someone down,
it's probably number one,

1996
01:28:58,011 --> 01:29:02,910
but Jujitsu is a very close second 
because the problem with Jujitsu is if a

1997
01:29:02,911 --> 01:29:05,360
guy knows how to wrestle really good and
he can keep you standing up,

1998
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:06,213
if he's better at punching and kicking,
he could fuck you up standing up and 

1999
01:29:08,521 --> 01:29:09,354
you'll never get the fight to the ground
to use your Jujitsu because his 

2000
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:13,470
wrestling could also keep the fight 
standing.

2001
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,960
The wrestling dictates where the fight 
takes place.

2002
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:18,240
That to me is the most critical thing 
like you have.

2003
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:19,303
If you're a wrestle,
you have the ability to take someone 

2004
01:29:20,341 --> 01:29:22,530
down,
you have the ability to stand up and you

2005
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:24,390
have to ability to keep someone from 
taking you down.

2006
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:26,640
Those are,
those are giant like that.

2007
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:29,850
To be able to choose where the fight 
takes place is giant.

2008
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:32,520
That's cool.
But when I was doing taekwondo,

2009
01:29:32,521 --> 01:29:35,610
there was really no mma.
No one had ever even invented it.

2010
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:39,090
I stopped fighting and 88,
I think 88 or 89.

2011
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:41,910
I'm not exactly sure.
I was doing comedy at the time too.

2012
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:47,100
When did you say we met?
We met in [inaudible] 93,

2013
01:29:47,101 --> 01:29:47,934
I think,
or [inaudible] 92 might have been 

2014
01:29:48,811 --> 01:29:51,810
[inaudible] 92.
So it was probably with Kim at the time.

2015
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:52,830
Yes.
Yeah,

2016
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,170
yeah,
yeah.

2017
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,760
Um,
yeah.

2018
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,490
I was done fighting then I was done,
but I was still thinking about it.

2019
01:30:00,491 --> 01:30:02,670
I was still thinking about it for years,
you know,

2020
01:30:02,671 --> 01:30:04,290
if everything went wrong,
call me,

2021
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:06,330
fell apart for me.
Maybe I'd take a fight,

2022
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:07,833
you know.
When did you know the comedy wasn't 

2023
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:12,060
going to pull up?
A couple weeks ago.

2024
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:16,950
Two weeks.
I was driving one of my car,

2025
01:30:17,470 --> 01:30:19,420
I was driving my car over to the other 
car,

2026
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:21,960
white workout,
sell all this.

2027
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:24,390
Just live modestly.
Yeah.

2028
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:25,370
I don't know man.
Uh,

2029
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,940
I,
its really.

2030
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:27,863
I've written,
I really didn't think I was gonna work 

2031
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:30,810
out until I was on tv,
you know,

2032
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:31,981
men.
I was like,

2033
01:30:31,981 --> 01:30:32,940
Hey,
this might be all right.

2034
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,080
Yeah.
But that's a good thing though,

2035
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,660
that not knowing if it's gonna work out.
It's what keeps you hungry.

2036
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:40,763
I think the worst thing in life could 
ever happen and she's getting an 

2037
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
inheritance.
GotTa texts the incentive away.

2038
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:46,200
Huh?
Why?

2039
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:47,700
Yeah.
You're not scared.

2040
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,833
You're not scared about the future.
You're not scared about what the fuck's 

2041
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:51,023
going to happen.
You have to have that feeling of not 

2042
01:30:54,091 --> 01:30:57,040
knowing is awesome.
I mean that,

2043
01:30:57,041 --> 01:31:00,780
that feeling creates movement and 
anxiety and energy.

2044
01:31:00,781 --> 01:31:03,910
Like some of my best sets I've ever had 
in my,

2045
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:08,070
the biggest jumps I've ever had in my 
life and my career have been after I had

2046
01:31:08,071 --> 01:31:08,904
terrible sets and some of my best 
moments in life as a person have been 

2047
01:31:13,111 --> 01:31:16,920
after I felt terrible.
Like after I just fuck something up or I

2048
01:31:16,921 --> 01:31:19,860
did something stupid and I just like,
how can I do that?

2049
01:31:19,861 --> 01:31:21,060
Like,
what the fuck is wrong with me?

2050
01:31:21,061 --> 01:31:21,894
And then you feel like shit for a few 
days and then you emerge out of it like 

2051
01:31:24,391 --> 01:31:25,224
a phoenix from the ashes and you,
you're a better person because of that 

2052
01:31:27,811 --> 01:31:30,540
bad feeling.
Like those bad moments,

2053
01:31:30,541 --> 01:31:34,200
like don't just drowned them out,
don't take pills,

2054
01:31:34,201 --> 01:31:35,270
don't,
don't just drowned them out.

2055
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:36,203
Sometimes those bad moments are an 
incentive for you to move forward and 

2056
01:31:39,631 --> 01:31:40,464
progress.

2057
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:43,210
I remember when I did the tonight show 
the first time,

2058
01:31:43,211 --> 01:31:45,800
it was not fun because it was like the 
imprimatur.

2059
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:49,420
Who's like Johnny Carson?
It was like a WHO's that?

2060
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:50,254
Like it was terrifying.
I wonder to run into the woods in 

2061
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,440
Burbank,
Burbank and start a new life.

2062
01:31:57,850 --> 01:31:59,110
I swear to God.
I just,

2063
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,870
I was so fucking patch of woods.
I was scared.

2064
01:32:01,871 --> 01:32:02,704
Yeah,
I know.

2065
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:07,840
But a tent from the street.
You know what I did Joe after?

2066
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,830
After my shirt.
What went?

2067
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:11,980
Did a set at the comedy store.
Oh Wow.

2068
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:12,843
Yeah.
I just wanted to see the juxtaposition 

2069
01:32:13,811 --> 01:32:15,720
of the two and must've felt good.
Oh fuck.

2070
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:17,350
Great.
Just to be back on my turf,

2071
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:18,730
you know,
because that wasn't my turf.

2072
01:32:18,850 --> 01:32:20,860
They said Teddy bears.
Ron Did that.

2073
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:22,000
Do you remember?
Teddy bears?

2074
01:32:22,001 --> 01:32:24,040
Ron Clark Academy store.
Let me tell you this,

2075
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:25,240
folks.
I don't know if I've said this before.

2076
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,220
I probably have because I'm repetitive 
fuckhead,

2077
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,600
but Teddy Burger on at one point in time
was one of the greatest comics that ever

2078
01:32:31,601 --> 01:32:33,940
lived.
He was fucking incredible.

2079
01:32:33,941 --> 01:32:38,740
And he did it tonight show set and he 
got on the piano and he was like singing

2080
01:32:38,741 --> 01:32:41,920
on the piano and talking on the piano 
and it was magical,

2081
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:43,023
magical.
And they said he went to the comedy 

2082
01:32:44,021 --> 01:32:44,854
store that night,
got fucked out of his head and was 

2083
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:47,133
stumbling into the streets and just out 
of his mind just had a problem with 

2084
01:32:49,781 --> 01:32:50,890
substances.
Yeah,

2085
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:51,733
I know.
I remember he was so drunk that we were 

2086
01:32:54,911 --> 01:32:58,600
at a club in Long Island and he sat on 
the edge of the stage and started crying

2087
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,600
and the audience thought that he was 
fucking around.

2088
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:04,040
So they all started laughing.
Oh my God,

2089
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:05,710
can you imagine?
So that's hilarious.

2090
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:07,780
And by the way,
his is set on the tonight show.

2091
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:08,643
This is what I was told.
He did so much overtime that they had 

2092
01:33:11,381 --> 01:33:13,780
the bump somebody and that's why he went
to the couch.

2093
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:16,210
Wasn't he went to the couch because it 
was so great.

2094
01:33:16,211 --> 01:33:17,044
It was.
And he never did the show again as far 

2095
01:33:19,451 --> 01:33:20,284
as I know.
But he never did the show again because 

2096
01:33:22,391 --> 01:33:25,600
he fucked something up.
I think he got drunk and he did this.

2097
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,670
He did way too much time.
Is that what it is?

2098
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:29,200
Yeah,
but they loved him.

2099
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:31,000
Like johnny was loving him,
like how could he not?

2100
01:33:31,001 --> 01:33:31,834
Johnny.
Johnny was very supportive of mostly 

2101
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:35,210
everybody you know.
So he was,

2102
01:33:35,211 --> 01:33:36,044
I mean he was the greatest.
Didn't Howard stern hate Johnny Carson 

2103
01:33:37,981 --> 01:33:38,814
though?
Did he really?

2104
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,990
I think he did.
I think he hated him.

2105
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:44,770
Like I remember him talking about Johnny
Carson being a terrible person,

2106
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:46,870
a piece of shit.
Yeah.

2107
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,760
I'm pretty sure.
I hope I'm not wrong with that.

2108
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:53,240
The most nervous I ever got ever for 
doing anything was doing stern.

2109
01:33:53,630 --> 01:33:54,463
Yeah.
I was terrified because you wanted to 

2110
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:59,230
see was an idol of mine.
I mean for me,

2111
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:03,340
he was um,
he was my generation's Johnny Carson.

2112
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:05,170
Yeah.
Because I didn't give a fuck about being

2113
01:34:05,171 --> 01:34:07,320
on the tonight show.
To me I was,

2114
01:34:07,321 --> 01:34:09,550
I was a dirty comic.
I cared about.

2115
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,590
I never thought I'd be on the show.
Yeah.

2116
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:12,453
I like,
I like guys like Hicks and Kennison and 

2117
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:19,960
dice and,
and prior and that's not that tonight.

2118
01:34:19,961 --> 01:34:22,360
Show stuff was great.
I enjoyed watching like Jenny on.

2119
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:25,900
Are you on or someone who's that?
Who could do that style and do it really

2120
01:34:25,901 --> 01:34:26,734
well though it was really hard for me.
I'd rather do Improv but used to do it 

2121
01:34:29,501 --> 01:34:31,410
well.
You were great on those shows.

2122
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:32,263
I tried,
but it's not you like at the comedy 

2123
01:34:34,661 --> 01:34:35,850
store killing?
No,

2124
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:37,760
it's a different thing.
It's a different thing.

2125
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:40,210
This was never attracted to it.
Just to me,

2126
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:42,850
the five minutes,
the censorship,

2127
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:45,280
the,
all this stuff is just like it.

2128
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:46,343
It didn't mean anything to me.
I always think the coolest thing about 

2129
01:34:47,951 --> 01:34:50,290
your career is you did what you wanted 
to do.

2130
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:52,570
I mean,
you basically,

2131
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:53,573
you did a sitcom.
He did like liquid through the career 

2132
01:34:55,811 --> 01:34:59,750
you have now.
I mean like it's only you in that lane.

2133
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:02,120
You know what I mean?
It's bizarre.

2134
01:35:02,121 --> 01:35:06,090
I don't know that you did you do this 
announcing jobs and it's like,

2135
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:06,953
dude,
could be just that and you're already a 

2136
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:09,940
success,
but you got to stand up.

2137
01:35:09,941 --> 01:35:11,610
You got anything you want,
you know?

2138
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:12,861
Well,
yeah.

2139
01:35:12,861 --> 01:35:15,010
It's just like you said,
it's just things I enjoy God.

2140
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:17,870
I'm lucky that there's things that I 
enjoy that our jobs,

2141
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:19,220
yeah,
lucrative,

2142
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:23,150
but it's always a good thing.
But the night before I did start for the

2143
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:25,740
first time I was shitting my pants.
Never.

2144
01:35:26,070 --> 01:35:28,970
I would never thought that nervous as 
fuck because it was,

2145
01:35:28,971 --> 01:35:31,490
to me it was like,
I can't even believe I'm really going to

2146
01:35:31,491 --> 01:35:32,324
do is show to me.
Like if they told me I was going to do 

2147
01:35:34,401 --> 01:35:35,240
tonight show,
I'd be like,

2148
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:36,500
alright,
I'll do it.

2149
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,290
Like I would have been a nervous.
I would have been.

2150
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,680
Would you do it now?
No,

2151
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:41,540
no,
I don't want to.

2152
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:45,020
I was know.
Well you could do is lose.

2153
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:45,973
It's better than can you can when you 
have a good set and fun and everything 

2154
01:35:48,411 --> 01:35:48,910
like that.
But,

2155
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:50,240
but you're expected to have it.
Say.

2156
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:53,840
Well it's just.
I talked too much.

2157
01:35:54,370 --> 01:35:55,203
I talked to.

2158
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:57,980
I talked too much already.
I've talked too much so far.

2159
01:35:57,981 --> 01:35:59,150
I want to go.
Let's go play pool.

2160
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:02,100
Let's wrap this fucker up.

2161
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:03,080
Let's do it.
Let's,

2162
01:36:03,150 --> 01:36:04,350

01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:07,130

Where can people see you?

2165
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:11,660
You got some dates coming up next week.

I don't know who maintains your website.

2171
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:34,880
Some guy who's a fan of mine.
He's a great guy.

2172
01:36:34,881 --> 01:36:36,620
This Guy David.

They have a calendar up there.

2174
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,300
How the fuck do people find out where 
your gigs are?

2175
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:46,460
I try to keep a secret.
I don't want to be bothered by crowds.

2176
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:50,450
Ladies and gentlemen,
go play some pool.
