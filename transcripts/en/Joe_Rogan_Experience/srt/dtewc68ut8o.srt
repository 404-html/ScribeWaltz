1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,420
The Joe Rogan Experience podcast is
brought to you for the second time today.

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,590
I'll buy the fleshlight to
redundancy department of redundancy.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,850
You already heard the commercials but
I got to say I'm anyway because of

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,950
contractual obligation to a
company that sells rubber pussies.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,530
Here is what it is you
believe in it anyway.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,850
Yes it's a solid product.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,510
It is.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,770
I would not sell it if it was not.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,730
It's an excellent product may be the
most effective thing in the world when it

10
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:30,930
comes to getting ready for loads.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,250
It's right up there.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,900
God damn it.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,440
Damn right up there with my left hand
it feels better than a than a bad vagina

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,520
feels better than a bat.

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,900
It feels like a really good one.

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,070
Not that you should limit a person and
making love to them to just their actual

17
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:44,670
vagina.

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,300
But when you get down to brass tacks
that's what you're having sex with.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,500
Tell me more about it.

20
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,510
Pain is and when he goes into the
vagina it feels pretty good feels pretty

21
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:54,930
swell.

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,880
It pairs well with a good my free cam.

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,773
There you go.

24
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,763
Free cams.

25
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,240
Oh there was some girls that were
soliciting your attention Brian and I fast

26
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,103
when I got them.

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,133
Yeah I bet you did.

28
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,420
Like what about me.

29
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,530
A bunch of my freakin hookers.

30
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,250
I love you to chasing after my pal.

31
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,080
I need a buddy who can
leave my little buddy.

32
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,250
And don't be me you dirty bitches.

33
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,690
Anyway fleshlight Joe Rogan
entering the codename Rogan.

34
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,920
That's my word.

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,640
What's my name.

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,560
Anthony Coney Brogan save
yourself 15 percent off.

37
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,210
We're also brought to
you by on a dog comments.

38
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,300
Oh and T.

39
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,410
Makers of Alpha Brain troop.

40
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,950
Did I ever give you any Alpha Brain stuff.

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,100
No I didn't count my time.

42
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,130
You need some advice.

43
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,213
What do you mean I need it.

44
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,670
You need it.

45
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,240
I'm.

46
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,920
Kind of hurtful.

47
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,753
It's bad.

48
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,470
Why don't I know you gonna have
it just me or let go everybody.

49
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,433
Oh I use it.

50
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,110
I'm one of you.

51
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,300
You try it just because I enjoy it.

52
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,500
What does it do to your memory.

53
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,180
Well it helps your brain function better.

54
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,120
It's like you know you drink a little cup
of coffee you get a little pick me up.

55
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,890
Yeah I mean you can think a little better.

56
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,490
At least I can Alpha Brain is it's like
that nutrients that may enhance your

57
00:01:55,921 --> 00:02:00,270
brain's ability to produce
neurotransmitters just
helps your brain flow.

58
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,690
There's a lot of controversial
science behind all this.

59
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,980
I use it and I use it because
it's effective and I've
been using it for years.

60
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,670
I started using it and I'll give another
plug to him because he's gonna be on

61
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:16,230
the podcast eventually Bill Roman asked
his neuro one was the first neutral pick

62
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
that I ever tried and he concocted this
combination of nutrients to help himself

63
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,590
after he had he developed a
few concussions from football.

64
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,130
I know he's actually said if he didn't
see stars he didn't think he was hit

65
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,570
right.

66
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,620
Jesus Christ.

67
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,690
Every day it's like
being in a car accident.

68
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,630
Tumble car expansion and you're
a big football fan right.

69
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,460
You're real aware of.

70
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,540
I was in Denver and we were doing some
big comedy central Romanesque he was.

71
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,030
They said well I said when I'm in L.A.

72
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,410
interview Romanesque ask is said no you
know I said I do like and I go in and

73
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:49,830
lunch.

74
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,460
He's sitting there at a table of eight
alone the rest of the place is packed.

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,513
Whoa yeah.

76
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,020
I don't mean to interrupt you but I just.

77
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,073
That's intense.

78
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,490
I mean I but I am curious
to know how scary.

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,090
It's like now that fucking guy by himself.

80
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,290
He was the one that spit in the guy's
face on Monday night football and then

81
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,480
they said it was a racial thing.

82
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,730
I'm thinking no it's not a racial thing.

83
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,593
He's just a nut.

84
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,190
Yeah he wasn't doing anything.

85
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,610
He's just a fucking gangster
on a grid of his stuff.

86
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,010
Neuro one is the first
nootropics I've ever tried.

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,710
If you're in shit now for
brain go to on it Doc comments.

88
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,690
Oh and I t use the code name Rogan and
save yourself 10 percent of any and all

89
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,260
orders.

90
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,460
We also have kettle bells.

91
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,440
And finally and they are the best quality
kettle bells that we could find there.

92
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,230
Made by York and we're selling
them as cheap as we can sell them.

93
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,773
They're excellent.

94
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,790
You only need to buy them once for an
entire lifetime's worth of use and they're

95
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,643
in my opinion.

96
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,740
They're my favorite
workout piece of equipment.

97
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,060
I don't hardly do anything other
than I do some bench press stuff.

98
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,050
I do some a lot of chin ups and bodyweight
squats and stuff like that but almost

99
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,320
everything else I do is kettle bells
because it's just such an effective

100
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,154
workout.

101
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,400
For like real body functional strength.

102
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,760
There's a lot of videos that are
available on how to use kettle bells will

103
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:07,640
eventually probably sell
them on on our site too.

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,650
We'll probably see if maybe we can buy
some from Steve Maxwell because I think

105
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:15,260
in my opinion he's like one of the
greatest kettlebell instructors alive.

106
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,610
And I've had the good pleasure of being
trained by him a couple of times so I

107
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:21,370
can vouch for his staff.

108
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,090
All of his videos are excellent.

109
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,020
They're awesome.

110
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,130
You can find them from Amazon and a
bunch of different places but any Steve

111
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:30,620
Maxwell video on kettlebell
is you can't go wrong.

112
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,760
Another one is extreme care about
cardio workout that drag indoor cells.

113
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,540
I fucking love that video too.

114
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,810
We don't have anything to do with any
of these videos but I'm just telling you

115
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,050
if you want to buy some kettle bells.

116
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,200
That's what I recommend go to on it.

117
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,310
Use the code name Rogan save yourself
10 percent off any and all orders the

118
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:47,690

Joe Rogan podcast by.

122
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,970
Oh powerful my rare.

123
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,390
Show you know we're always doing
the Irish against each other.

124
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:05,660
Yeah.

125
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,150
Why is that.

126
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,120
Why don't you go.

127
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,620
We've been doing that for folks decades.

128
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,160
Well I went to Ireland right.

129
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,320
I got to Ireland.

130
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,100
Unbelievable.

131
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,960
I mean it was like I thought I told you
over the phone but I go in and I'm in

132
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:18,794
Galway.

133
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,880
Tomorrow.

134
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,700
For fuck's sake we heard you
with Joe Rogan we love the show.

135
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,803
What key it goes.

136
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,190
I started doing martial arts because a
Joe you really have an effect around the

137
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,880
world.

138
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,730
This beautiful Galway Kilkenny.

139
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,940
This isn't even Dublin.

140
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,210
Well you know what.

141
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,930
I don't think men are
represented fairly in the media.

142
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:41,030
I don't think there's enough actual you
know guys that are telling you what's

143
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:43,440
what's really going on from
their honest perspective.

144
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,870
As someone that you can relate to.

145
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,220
You know I think a lot of people are full
of shit and I think a lot of men could

146
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:50,480
use a martial arts training.

147
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,230
It's good for you.

148
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,140
I think martial arts and
comedy is a great great mix.

149
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,070
It does work.

150
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,080
Yeah it seems like it wouldn't
but it really does work.

151
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,680
You know when I was when I was a martial
arts guy only and I got into comedy I

152
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:04,190
was almost embarrassed of being like
having something to do with martial arts

153
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:05,450
cause it seemed so do she.

154
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,210
It doesn't seem like that would
like that would be funny at all.

155
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,110
Joe even people that beat the shit
that other people want to have a laugh

156
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,970
they want to relax.

157
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,913
Oh.

158
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,190
Yeah.

159
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,600
Comedy is great for your martial arts.

160
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,140
Great for you everybody and it's
beautiful when I hear it stuff like that.

161
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,600
Somebody is always great.

162
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,280
I got such a kick out of it.

163
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,720
I mean it happened every night.

164
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,770
Every night.

165
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,740
Guys came because they
heard me on the podcast.

166
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,500
That's awesome.

167
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,333
Yeah.

168
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,403
That's awesome.

169
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,490
I get people sending me pictures of
their kale shakes that drink kale shakes

170
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:38,324
every morning.

171
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,860
So I got a lot of people doing this.

172
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,750
Kevin James got me on know Kevin James
lost 80 pounds for this movie where he

173
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:45,710
played an Indian a fighter.

174
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,860
Yeah and looked fuckin fantastic
his fucking face became thin.

175
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,380
We always told me how strong he was.

176
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,243
He's an animal.

177
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,720
Kevin James loves to eat.

178
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,890
He eats like a motherfucker.

179
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,560
But physically that guy
is a he's a bear dude.

180
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,000
He's a big boned head.

181
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,010
He hits hard.

182
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,120
He's a big scary motherfucker and he
you know he really could have been a

183
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:07,160
fighter if he ever chose
to go down that path.

184
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,650
He has like serious power
like especially in his hands.

185
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,610
But he he hit mitts with Mark Dela
granny and I was watch him hit them.

186
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,710
It's like he's like a real
athlete even though he's a guy.

187
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,030
So he lost all this weight and he looks
so good I was so blown away I was like

188
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:21,080
What the fuck did you do.

189
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,440
And he said the most important thing is
everything I switch to an all vegetable

190
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:25,274
diet.

191
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,480
Everything was vegetables.

192
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,910
Everyday he didn't eat any
animal products at all.

193
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,540
And he did this for a long time.

194
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,970
He went back to it eventually but he
would have a kale shake every morning.

195
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,040
And the idea was you you have this
thing called a Vita makes you throw Kale

196
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:45,041
Cucumber celery pears and then I throw
ginger and garlic in there and borrow it

197
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,620
and it tastes like ass.

198
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,480
I mean it's barely eatable.

199
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,260
You just sort of.

200
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,350
Every time I do it it's like
a little victory like there.

201
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,303
I just get it.

202
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,930
I got to that next.

203
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,710
The next day I win again.

204
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,300
You know every time I
do it I feel like I win.

205
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,830
But we had that good
but I was just saying.

206
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,640
But nutrient wise it's
like incredibly dense.

207
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,530
It opens up your bowels your shit comes
out like like it's just a lubed up in on

208
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:09,920
a right.

209
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,700
You know one of those water slides and
that's so it's like it's like your body

210
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,340
feels like weight healthier
water slides should till.

211
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,910
I've always wondered shit so spectacular
my shit's when I have these you will

212
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:21,840
get in white people tell you
what are your shit things.

213
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,783
I don't wish I did.

214
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,500
I wish people could have if I could like
record it and then play it back for you

215
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,510
you could feel how great it feels when I
see so Joy a Christmas you effortlessly

216
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,780
pours out of my ass.

217
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,450
And that's something to
be back with the show.

218
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,070
My shit's entirely green your kid it
goes right through me entirely green.

219
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,383
It's crazy.

220
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,010
It's like man how clean is my asshole
my asshole is like vegetable fresh

221
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,863
Marchioness.

222
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,430
Yeah.

223
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,760
So it's that's all I learned from Kevin
and that's like people send me these

224
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:51,860
pictures now all the time
they're kale shakes like that.

225
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,130
Yeah.

226
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,290
Like all the time on Twitter
you know one with the dinner.

227
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,400
You my kill suit to go with
dinner at the Palm that night.

228
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:58,830
Yeah.

229
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,600
At the steak house.

230
00:08:59,600 --> 00:08:59,930
Yeah.

231
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,380
Great point.

232
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:00,920
I know this.

233
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,100
Yeah.

234
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,170
Kevin was in a great mood talking lamp
and as soon as the food came he was going

235
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,360
to make him fucking look
up by going his last meal.

236
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,210
Well that's when Kevin had
gotten back to eating again.

237
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,080
And that was because he had really
like Christine he's all in and nothing.

238
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,420
He's like Yeah he's kind of
like me in a lot of ways.

239
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,660
He's we're very similar and one of the
ways is that we do crazy about things.

240
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,690
You know he'll get crazy about golf and
he's like FUCK HIM want to play golf all

241
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:24,470
day every year.

242
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,380
Well that's yeah you're like that in pool.

243
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:26,830
Yeah.

244
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,570
And I got a real problem and starting
a bottom up after three hours.

245
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,890
Joe I'm tired.

246
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,150
I played a woman the other day
and we only played a race to five.

247
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,260
It was I kind of was such a tease I
wasn't even warmed up yet it was how I can

248
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,830
for me pool is like three or
four hour experiment experience.

249
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,240
You have that long time.

250
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:49,100
Like I said I said Do you have the
marathon runner and I have a sprinter

251
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:52,730
mentality like when I'm on stage if I'm
doing really well I can't wait to get

252
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:54,680
the fuck out because
I'm doing really well.

253
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,140
I went for 45 minutes I'm out of there.

254
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,290
Bing bang boom.

255
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,280
But like you love to be up there for
a couple hours Yeah and it's great.

256
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,420
I mean I think only if I can maintain
that energy and I've never seen you not.

257
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,260
Well I think it's also you have to factor
in the audience's energy so I don't do

258
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:11,550
shows as long as I used to do.

259
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,160
I've done some stupid like
two and a half hour shows.

260
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,770
And the problem often is people don't
want to hear you talk for two and a half

261
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,000
hours after a while they're bored.

262
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,570
It's like and then the end of it it
was always it always came like this.

263
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,360
Question and answer section right.

264
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,950
And if that felt to me like what I was
doing was I was having this killer hour

265
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:32,250
and 10 minutes a comedy and then I was
ending it with like an hour of mediocrity

266
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,790
and I was like This is like the question
answered sometimes would be awesome but

267
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:39,930
sometimes it would just sort
of become a and yell fast.

268
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,330
People yelling shit and just become
gross and well some of that you know the

269
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,050
Dave Dave Chappelle thing
with the five hours.

270
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,620
Yes.

271
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,890
I said to the I think it was up to seven.

272
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,430
Okay whatever but some ridiculous and
I said to the booker of the club I said

273
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:54,360
that he did material.

274
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,820
She goes it was all new material.

275
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,140
This isn't one I don't believe that.

276
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,430
So I asked the staff that go for material.

277
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,840
He asked one guy where it was from
three times the guy says I'm still from

278
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:04,674
Pittsburgh.

279
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,140
That's hilarious.

280
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,790
Well you know if people are willing to
just sit there and you just sit around

281
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:16,791
talking heads that still stand up you
know it's like your standup is your You're

282
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:19,200
a craftsman.

283
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,860
When you go up there you've got jokes
you got punch lines you got setups you

284
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:23,100
got.

285
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,350
You can't wait to get to
them because they're killer.

286
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,450
But I have no idea how
to write I swear to God.

287
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,260
I mean I'm true.

288
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,310
I don't I don't have any idea how to
write a joke because it has to come out.

289
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,580
In its own way.

290
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,700
I don't know how to like mathematically
you remember Rita Rudner.

291
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,090
People like that are like
joke technicians right.

292
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,270
And I know you do know how to write
a joke or you just say funny thing.

293
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,360
I just write what I do as I write and I
write blogs like blog entries and then

294
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,210
in the in writing about something
since there's no pressure to be funny.

295
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Then I get the ideas for jokes out of
that or I have ideas and I'll slowly work

296
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:00,720
them out on stage.

297
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,920
I do a bunch of different ways.

298
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,630
Sometimes I don't have anything written.

299
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,470
It's just this idea that's been fucking
with me and then I go on stage and I try

300
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:10,740
it one way and then I say well it was
that that idea was misinterpreted and I'll

301
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:13,320
try it another way the next
time until eventually I get it.

302
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,300
I had dreams last two weeks of
shit that was killing and my dream

303
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,110
that we playing pool.

304
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,920
Oh yeah.

305
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,150
That's another one since then.

306
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,500
But I was having this dream
about organic alcohol.

307
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,940
What was the one that you told me we
were playing pool our relief pitcher.

308
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:30,660
Yes yes.

309
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,900
I had this dream like
and fucking 70000 people.

310
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,280
And what's up with relief pitchers.

311
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,840
I mean you know it's a
relief if they get off.

312
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,570
And I was like like such stupid non joke
I know I'm fucking like it was a part

313
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:45,790
of me that I think I knew I was asleep
and I thought I can't wait to wake up to

314
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,220
write this down oh no it's nothing it's
nothing it was funny it was so funny

315
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,280
it's funny and you were killing me.

316
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,700
It was real out of my fucking thought
throngs of people I know I've done that

317
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:57,110
before.

318
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,900
I know I've had dreams where I was killing
on stage I could remember God is the

319
00:13:00,901 --> 00:13:04,380
best stuff I've ever written
and I couldn't wait to
write it down and I woke up

320
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,580
like were you talking do you
ever wake up laughing Joe.

321
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,020
Sometimes yeah I had a dream when I was
first moved to New York and my dream was

322
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:16,680
I had a job and was involved I had to
sit and shoot to see how long scientists

323
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:20,490
would stand around with these charts
see how long it took soup to cool and it

324
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:22,350
was chicken gumbo soup right.

325
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,520
And I remember sitting in
the soup was like fuck I.

326
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,990
And then I sit down and
I turn to the camera.

327
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,110
There's a camera in my dream and I go
8 eight dollars an hour sitting in soup

328
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,010
out bag and a big.

329
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,750
Then I moved to New York and
then the rest is history.

330
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,300
That's hilarious.

331
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,240
I think if you laugh a lot and you used
to laugh in a line it's more likely to

332
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,740
get a laugh in dreams.

333
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,100
Yeah I would have bought Chrysler just
sits there and laugh like nonstop in his

334
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,820
dream.

335
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,520
I'll tell you why.

336
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,920
Is a happy motherfucker right now.

337
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,110
That guy is that guy I've never met
anybody who's like more thankful for like

338
00:13:55,111 --> 00:13:58,560
his success in life things that are
going well in his life and so happy.

339
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,270
He's such a happy nice guy.

340
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,660
I always wondered about guys who were
always depressed like Marc Maron.

341
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,860
Yeah I got a love more but Marc was
one of those guys that was always so

342
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:08,370
depressed.

343
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,150
Now he's successful and he's got a really
nice girlfriend goes it's bother you

344
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,870
guys I don't know what to do what my
feelings because I'm so used these so used

345
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:16,704
to be miserable.

346
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,870
It's gonna be careful man because all
that is really bad for you all the years

347
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:25,020
of and that's not like woo
woo that's like that's real.

348
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,160
New Years of harboring resentment and
bad feelings and selfishness like that.

349
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,140
All that negativity that fucks with you
and keeps you from sleeping seems better

350
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:35,520
to me though I'm sure it is.

351
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,780
I'm sure he is I mean
he's a smart guy he knows.

352
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,830
I mean he's been one of the things is he
doing a podcast where you read it very.

353
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,310
Very openly bare your soul.

354
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,090
Yeah I mean he like when he does these
like monologues where he talks about

355
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:55,650
things in the beginning of his know
his podcast he's being he's very honest

356
00:14:55,651 --> 00:15:00,651
about all of his transgressions
and thoughts about him
in the past and all sorts

357
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:02,370
of different things.

358
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,880
So I think it's like super therapeutic
in a way to do something like that.

359
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,940
Like you can really get over
your shit when you broadcast it.

360
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,680
Yeah you know and I I think I
think we all have a tendency.

361
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,930
It's so easy to go towards the negative.

362
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,650
It's just so dangerous.

363
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,300
It's so dangerous to think that that's
the more profound way to think it's so

364
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:22,770
it's so fucking stupid for you.

365
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,520
I never really let somebody
else's success diminish me.

366
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,350
I just thought you never have.

367
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,750
You've never been a jealous
guy ever get anybody.

368
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,800
Somebody said one time about Eddie Murphy.

369
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,250
Does it bother you that it would.

370
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,070
Eddie Murphy.

371
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:35,850
Do me.

372
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,200
He's tremendously talented.

373
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,030
It's not like if he didn't
do 48 hours I would've.

374
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,920
Well you know I love he's loved about you
Dom and not just that you were a great

375
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:46,370
comic but you really loved standup comedy.

376
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,520
Like there wasn't.

377
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,510
There's always everyone had this idea
at some point time in comedy that.

378
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:52,620
You do.

379
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,610
I mean not everyone but a lot of people
in Hollywood you did you put together an

380
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:59,930
act and then you got a sitcom and then
you got a sitcom and then you went from a

381
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:03,750
sitcom to a movie career and
that's dealing with it do
it and anyway else is not

382
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:06,370
fun but you were like
I like being a comic.

383
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,100
I'm kind of making plenty of money.

384
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,210
I got a nice car and I live in a nice
house like What the fuck you want for my

385
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,780
need.

386
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,613
What do you want from me.

387
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,453
What else.

388
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,330
Yeah.

389
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,380
Well one guy says to me goes what else
you got coming up every day this is like

390
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:20,100
the deli man.

391
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,020
What else what else.

392
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,690
Another.

393
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,523
That's all you got.

394
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,790
And I said them Look I like it.

395
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,500
Nickelodeon really cool.

396
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,920
They've got a movie and we're going
to series because you got anything big

397
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:29,754
coming up.

398
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,600
The first thing you've got coming
up at Jiffy Lube a new muffler.

399
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,493
I don't bother.

400
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,300
I don't judge other people's career.

401
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,290
It's a funny thing though.

402
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,820
People will talk shit I've seen so many
people talk shit on Twitter about random

403
00:16:41,821 --> 00:16:46,220
people's careers like whatever happened
to our IP to this guy's career.

404
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,350
Like who the fuck are you.

405
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,120
Like Woody.

406
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,930
What why is that.

407
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,740
What is that weird free shot that's
you know that's a bizarre thing.

408
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,150
Sportswriters who couldn't make their
grade school football teams are critiquing

409
00:16:57,151 --> 00:17:00,780
guys like Roman Polanski critiquing
guys that were great players you never

410
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:04,150
played they never played anything
well I'd critique fighters on there.

411
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,610
My fight kickboxing and taekwondo but
I'm never following them I may fight.

412
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,830
All I do is yeah but you wouldn't believe
you if it came up when you were coming

413
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,210
up it would have you
would have fought them.

414
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:17,330
Yeah I would have and I'd probably
be a pig probably a mess right now.

415
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,590
Right about now physically on there.

416
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,100
Forget the fight that I came to see you
and the mother and the sister would sit

417
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:27,030
next to me they're gonna get knocked
down that's when reality hits you.

418
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,620
When you sit next to the relatives.

419
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,210
Yeah well especially if they get badly
cowed and so there's a visceral fear that

420
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:36,990
comes from people getting badly killed
because it looks like they're done.

421
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,940
Guy gets head kicked or something.

422
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,270
You remember with that fight in Vegas and
the guy got hit and the ref caught him

423
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,020
too.

424
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,450
He was so light you remember
it was Felix Trinidad.

425
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,230
Really.

426
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,910
Yeah yeah.

427
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,910
We saw Felix Trinidad I forget who was
fighting but it was when Trinidad was

428
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:52,950
really coming up.

429
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,220
It was when he was like I think
it was a welterweight fight.

430
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,240
Yeah.

431
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,490
Caught him on the left
hook bam dropped him.

432
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,540
Felix Trinidad had a wicked left and the
ref caught up to one the ref called the

433
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,810
guy before he hit the ground up
to lead the back of his head.

434
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,220
Then just the front of his head was.

435
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,840
Yeah we saw a couple
great fights in Vegas.

436
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,590
I don't remember who else we saw fight
there but I mean we saw a couple good

437
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:14,424
fights there.

438
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,660
Boxing live is weird like you know I'm
used to it at the UFC because I'm the

439
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:19,390
voice of it.

440
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,810
Yeah it's weird when you're sitting
there and you don't hear any commentary.

441
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,860
Yes watching guys just fucking get
the shit kicked out of each other.

442
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,460
Yeah.

443
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,230
What you've seen is just the
sounds of it s wet the blood.

444
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,900
Yeah the impact sounds and
the O's of the audience.

445
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,783
Oh yeah.

446
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,350
Oh shit.

447
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,710
I told you what I realized after seeing
that stuff when I and I want to do it

448
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:40,470
again you know I loved
it but I love violence.

449
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:41,640
I do.

450
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,060
I love but.

451
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,940
I just don't like fake violence so I
don't like violent movies because I don't

452
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:48,540
like that I don't like seeing somebody
like Joe Pesci be able to beat some 25

453
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,520
year old stud because he's the star.

454
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:50,930
Right.

455
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,290
Right.

456
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:51,560
Right.

457
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,650
I don't buy that shit.

458
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,600
Get out of here.

459
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,610
You know it's like yeah.

460
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,360
You know Joe Pesci almost got beat up
by the bouncer at the Laugh Factory.

461
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,090
You know that story.

462
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,170
Yeah that was red.

463
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,000
Red was the mulatto guy.

464
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,740
He looked like a human wall.

465
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,640
Well this was a different story then
because I'm talking about Ken big hand the

466
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:09,420
rapper.

467
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,230
Well it was Ken.

468
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,950
Yeah.

469
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,080
I thought was red because the one where
he says you ain't never did it and I'm

470
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,630
just saying no movie motherfucker.

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,460
Anyways he was oh it was a.

472
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,350

473
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,180
You remember Kendra.

474
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,430

00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:20,970

He's a football player and a rapper and
apparently something happened and Joe

479
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:28,974
Pesci got it.

480
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,820
He tried to go crazy with them
and got yelled at out of town.

481
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,390
And Ken was like this fucking movie bit.

482
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,340
And he got fired.

483
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,443
Can't get fired.

484
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,700
Did he get fired for that.

485
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,903
Really.

486
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,020
Wow that's sad.

487
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,960
That makes me sad.

488
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,030
Jamie Masada.

494
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,673

00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,260
Jamie Masada the owner of the Laugh
Factory was a dishwasher at the Comedy

499
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,340
He decided to pull the other some money
and start his own fucking business.

500
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,720
Kind of money did he get together.

501
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,550
They both have a laugh factory on stage
I would say that he came over here as a

502
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,420
as a Jewish guy from Drew.

503
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,580
They run through Israeli came over here
as a Jew busted broke which for a Jew is

504
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,370
like a couple of million dollars.

505
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,683
This table.

506
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,350

I just love watching
people figure shit out.

528
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,480
I love knowing that that that whole
process of figuring shit out is possible.

I gotta do it.

536
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,240
I'm starting to reach
the depths of alcoholism.

537

Yeah yeah well we talked
about the whole Xanax thing.

I think I do.

541

I think you do.

542
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,260
And I'm like I don't like smoke.

543
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,580

Yeah.

550
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,600
You got a drive and then you
should do it legit get a license.

551
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,100
Yeah.

552
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,370
Yeah.

553
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,630
He could get a marijuana prescription for.

554
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,880
I always wanted to take a
couple of hit various ailments.

555
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:58,470
Well good luck maybe next time you
do the podcast we'll plan it out.

556
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,460
So I'm driving.

557
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,290
You know to worry about driving anywhere
and we'll bake you out on air okay.

558
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,403
What do you think.

559
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,070
Good pose.

560
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,910
I get paranoid.

561
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,350
Well that's very likely.

562
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,700
That's very likely.

563
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,690
But how much does it take to get you high.

564
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,770
I'm just a little bit.

565
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:13,320
Yeah.

566
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,610
This is a really strong weed.

567
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,540
You know they keep talking about that in
the news and we've talked about this on

568
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,590
the podcast before.

569
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,800
There's the numbers of you know what
the THC is so high that this is not your

570
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:26,130
father's marijuana.

571
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,210
It's totally true.

572
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,370
It's fucking really strong weed now
but it's still not going to hurt you.

573
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,313
So I'm gonna kill you.

574
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,000
How long does it take
to weed out dangerous.

575
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,900
It just freaks you out.

576
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,210
You could take hours
depending on your body.

577
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,840
She's that's the only thing I don't
like getting stuck in something.

578
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,540
Yeah.

579
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,260
If I don't like it.

580
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,610
Well could be an issue.

581
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,140
Stan hope that he doesn't like it.

582
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,650
Stanley Hey Tweed really sad
like alcohol like anything down.

583
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,633
Yeah.

584
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,180
Did I tell you that when I'm being best
friends is prosecuting the Sandusky

585
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:51,750
case.

586
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,530
Oh my God.

587
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,070
And I knew about this like over a
year and a half ago but they didn't.

588
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,790
They had been big gathering up
evidence and it's really interesting.

589
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,590
I mean it's we were doing like roleplaying
and trying to see what Sandusky would

590
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:05,520
stay if he took the stand.

591
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,720
His wife's on the stand today.

592
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,153
Well imagine.

593
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,120
That's crazy.

594
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,830
Oh my God.

595
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:14,240
And like we're doing things like why
would 10 kids you know embarrassed

596
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:15,420
themselves that come out.

597
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,680
Well I don't know.

598
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,270
Maybe they misremembered it.

599
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,760
I love that misremember what bullshit.

600
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,570
But it's so scary.

601
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,020
The whole story is so scary
because they protected him.

602
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,070
Yeah they protected that guy.

603
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,540
You know when when people freaked out
when everybody went on a goddamn rampage

604
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,940
cause Joe Paterno got fired.

605
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,730
I wonder what information they had.

606
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,300
You know I mean Joe when
you just go to the cops.

607
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,033
Oh yeah.

608
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,310
Well why would you go for the chain
of command what is this Nazi Germany.

609
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,450
I don't understand.

610
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,010
I don't understand what coming down.

611
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,350
I understand what happened and what why.

612
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,730
What they said happened was he went to
and another assistant coach went to his

613
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:56,850
father and then they went to
paternal paternal somebody else.

614
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,940
I would've gone to the cops right
away if I see somebody hurting a kid.

615
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:00,923
Bam.

616
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,290
And then how do you not beat him
to death right there on the spot.

617
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:04,980
Yeah.

618
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,820
You know that's gotta
be an instinct too much.

619
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,580
Who'd want to beat him to death.

620
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,220
That guy's raping a boy.

621
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,550
The whole thing is just so creepy if it
really happened the way they're saying

622
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:15,360
it happened.

623
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,630
I mean I'm assuming at this point
in time that he's he's guilty.

624
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,220
I just know that I not.

625
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,500
Why would all these kids come in.

626
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,270
Yeah you're right.

627
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,330
No we have simply they
didn't come from the same.

628
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,020
I'm not I would certainly not argue and
I just you know for the sake of being

629
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:30,210
fair the whole thing
is fucking horrifying.

630
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,240
It's so terrifying it's so terrifying
that they had this monster and protected.

631
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,580
Then they if that's really the case.

632
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,830
Yeah that's so scary to me as well.

633
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,510
Catholic Catholic Church type stuff.

634
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,050
How else could they not know.

635
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,080
I mean how could they not know.

636
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,650
The Catholic Church type
stuff is fucking horrifying.

637
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,700
We used to have a priest that molested
us when I was a summer in summer camp.

638
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,170
Really.

639
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,010
You never got me because I was such a nut.

640
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,310
I was always a light sleeper and afraid
of the dark like a real man I would have

641
00:25:00,311 --> 00:25:02,800
a flashlight on under my under my sheets.

642
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,230
So every night I slept real late you know.

643
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,123
But he.

644
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,220
And we knew about it and nobody said
anything because he was a priest.

645
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,140
Oh my God.

646
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,220
And then they just had
a whole thing about him.

647
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,620
Even though he's dead they
condemned his actions and stuff.

648
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,050
And the Philly papers recently.

649
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,250
What did he d to do.

650
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,910
He would just like you know jerk off
kids in their sleep or wouldn't play with

651
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:22,744
them or whatever.

652
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,990
God I don't think he.

653
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,400
I don't think he did any of the Sandusky
type level stuff because it was mostly

654
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,234
a sleep thing.

655
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,090
It's amazing when you
find out how many of them.

656
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:31,990
Oh my God.

657
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,260
Yeah.

658
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,710
Well apparently the whole.

659
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,040
Not having sex thing.

660
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,600
Abstinence thing doesn't work.

661
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,170
Well now is it not work like
it's who is signing up for that.

662
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,360
It's not like you go to a
different heaven than me.

663
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,260
All I have to do is be a good guy and
follow God's word and I go to heaven to

664
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,670
run and you don't get pussy.

665
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,350
I get to fuck my wife and I don't get it.

666
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,213
That's ridiculous.

667
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,040
Yeah that's that's no
net no natural person.

668
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,950
Now I mean the something wrong
with you is bad for your prostate.

669
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,350
Not to come it is your prostate cancer.

670
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,520
Yeah it's terrible.

671
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:05,550
And not only is it terrible like how
how could an organization exist that has

672
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:09,790
this many people to fuck kids could you
imagine they just start it up tomorrow.

673
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,090
Yeah the Catholic Church started up
tomorrow and all of sudden you know there

674
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:16,600
was no Catholic Church
and then all suddenly said
listen we just found this new

675
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:17,320
religion.

676
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,990
It's it's we're really sure
this is what Jesus really meant.

677
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,820
And they just started fucking kids 20
percent of us kids director right away

678
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,160
people would stop it they would
go What the fuck are you doing.

679
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,310
You can't you can't do this.

680
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:28,590
That's

681
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:28,700
.

682
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,290
You know with the shifting of the people
was just as bad as some of the horrible

683
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,600
they're putting a predator in a new area.

684
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,830
Well that was Ratzinger.

685
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,330
The guy was the pope right now.

686
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,860
He was in charge of that shit.

687
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,173
You know what he said.

688
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,790
Yeah he said something about
why did they cause Ireland.

689
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,360
The churches are empty and they said Why.

690
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,420
You know with so much molestation
he said it's a mystery.

691
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:50,883
What the fuck.

692
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,800
What kind of answer is that.

693
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,940
Like everything's a mystery.

694
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,740
It's a mystery.

695
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,320
It's not a Miss Universe smarty
Irish people are fucking smart.

696
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:57,940
Yeah.

697
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,530
That's why are smart they are smart.

698
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,340
Smart as fuck.

699
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,690
I love doing stand up there.

700
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,180
There they are they're rowdy smart people.

701
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,930
They're not they're not
buying your bullshit.

702
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,600
You can only fuck their kids for so long.

703
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,160
The rest of world has to catch up.

704
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,593
That's right.

705
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,830
Ireland's figured it out.

706
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,160
Yeah.

707
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,130
You can't fuck our kids.

708
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,640
That's all I was going to Kilkenny
more than any of the other Americans.

709
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,050
You know.

710
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:21,520
I really know a lot of people are so far
going to the grocery store next to the

711
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:26,521
hotel and this Asian guy Cosby dumber
and dumber and it goes to an Asian guy

712
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:28,414
with an Irish accent.

713
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,910
It's half Irish have a I can't do it.

714
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,300
He says it makes me want to try it.

715
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,300
I think it makes me sad because done.

716
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,883
This on me.

717
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:39,843
We all don't.

718
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,680
You'll come back again
next year all right.

719
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,160
I thought how fucking nice is that.

720
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,610
Like a thousand miles away from my house.

721
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,483
I've got a friend.

722
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:46,750
Yeah.

723
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,330
Give me a sandwich you know like.

724
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,720
Thanks a lot Mr a free sandwich but
it's really really cool of them.

725
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:55,570
What is cool when you go to a place and
you develop like friends that you see

726
00:27:55,571 --> 00:27:56,404
like once a year.

727
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,940
Oh yeah it is nice.

728
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,680
That's nice aspects of the road.

729
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,460
Absolutely.

730
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,680
I mean a little town Kilkenny
walking down a street.

731
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,460
Don't worry.

732
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,030
Damn I heard I hit the USA Today for
you I know you like the sports there.

733
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,300
Because they're asked they don't like
basketball they don't like they like

734
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:15,301
soccer and hurling and Irish you know
them hurling hurling is not it's not

735
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,720
throwing up and it's like
fucking rugby with sticks.

736
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,673
Such a.

737
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,970
Oh it's a crazy game.

738
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,200
Oh my God.

739
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,310
Dude I've never heard that throw that
shit up going rougher side side of

740
00:28:27,311 --> 00:28:28,144
lacrosse.

741
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,680
Irish people are savages.

742
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:30,880
They're fun.

743
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,530
I'll take you know I did Joe tell
him to have a problem with drinking.

744
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,560
I actually told the audience I give up.

745
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,423
You win.

746
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,700
I came here thinking I was an alcoholic.

747
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,850
I realized I'm a moderate
social drinker people win.

748
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,620
I've never met people less understandable
that were speaking English than

749
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:48,454
Northern Ireland.

750
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:48,940
Oh yeah.

751
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,040
Because they don't move their
mouth like a ventriloquist.

752
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,290
Oh my God look at this fucking game.

753
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,820
What are they doing.

754
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,360
This is called hurling.

755
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,233
Huh.

756
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,113
Yeah.

757
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:06,600
The Kilkenny cats are the local team so
they are why they must hit the fuck out

758
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:07,280
of each other with those.

759
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,113
Oh yeah.

760
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,180
Oh my.

761
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,780
And now shapes Nick look at oh this is
crazy they're smashing a meaning each

762
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:15,810
other three thousand years
of sporting heritage.

763
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,430
A lot of crazy ass came to beat the fuck
out of each other with these sticks.

764
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,800
Oh my God.

765
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,380
Oh and they run right into the full
clip and that's why they think American

766
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:30,630
football is such pussies because
they have so much equipment.

767
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,480
This is this is the craziest game ever.

768
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,550
I did not know this existed.

769
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,940
How can I be alive for this long.

770
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,120
There's no rules.

771
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,680
This guy just grabbed the ball threw
it up in the air and then hit it.

772
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,610
You say no rules or new rules no rules.

773
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,640
These guys are animals.

774
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,700
How long.

775
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,870
How long have you known about this.

776
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,980
Since I've been going there you know I
used to wear their shirt when I could

777
00:29:55,981 --> 00:30:00,390
still fit into it and when I was a
mature Boy I hate seeing that look at me.

778
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,500
The image I have no idea
that I look like that.

779
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,840
It's like a cat without whiskers that
thinks they can get through any small

780
00:30:06,841 --> 00:30:07,674
space.

781
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,210
I have no idea how bloated I am.

782
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,430
My eyes look like they're half open.

783
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,750
They say my doctor caustically only said
to me I mean Craig Ferguson because he

784
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:19,470
uses his old kind of language because
say I'm it Ferguson You look like a

785
00:30:19,471 --> 00:30:20,304
Chinaman.

786
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,110
I said who says Chinaman.

787
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,560
Yeah last time you were here you were
talking I tell you I knew it well.

788
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,980
You said you were looking like an Inuit
so you develop as cool like and I could

789
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:34,800
still even that that look I could
still get women because of my act.

790
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,400
Thank God for my act
powerful down my Rara.

791
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,780
Were you just in Atlanta.

792
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,213
I'm in Atlanta.

793
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,490
I was in Atlanta this week.

794
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,510
I went Great Priceline and and I'm in
Atlantic City on the 30th and 30th of June

795
00:30:48,391 --> 00:30:49,224
at the Tropicana.

796
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,273
Oh nice.

797
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,450
I was telling my friend McGettigan
that tickets available for that.

798
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,480
How do people get those tickets.

799
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:59,040
I guess just call the Tropicana box
office post on my friend McGettigan who's

800
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:03,660
doing the the Sandusky trial is there
any way he could plug my date Lanark

801
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,020
season.

802
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,530
How can I do that I simply you know you
go open with the ladies general jury

803
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:12,531
your honor the spin Sandusky has
caused so much pain to so many people.

804
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,510
Unlike comedian Dom rare who be at
the trial on June 30th 8:00 o'clock.

805
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,160
Tickets available would be hilarious.

806
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,370
Could you imagine if you actually did.

807
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,200
Yes.

808
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,050
Holy shit.

809
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,620
Talk about taking the
credibility away from a trial.

810
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,200
Yeah.

811
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,630
I might fuck up the whole trial.

812
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,550
They might they might
get you he might get off.

813
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,900
They can't really joke around.

814
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,200
Turns out I was reading some of the
opening statements to me and somebody said

815
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,330
What was he reading it
for you to punch it up.

816
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,193
I don't know.

817
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,020
Just give it a bounce
it off somebody I'm not.

818
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,240
But the point is that he's the prosecutor.

819
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,600
Yeah he's the prosecutor can I
send him all my positive energy.

820
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,040
Get that motherfucker.

821
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,630
He's there.

822
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,000
Get him.

823
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,960
He's a genius man.

824
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,870
It's amazing that a guy like
Sandusky is still alive.

825
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,450
You know what all the
negative show has done.

826
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,430
How is his body still holding up.

827
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,293
How is this though.

828
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,760
How about when he waves to people
like he's running for office.

829
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,210
He gets it.

830
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,370
He's smiling and shit.

831
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,090
I could see a psychotic he is.

832
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,260
I mean if anybody else accused if you're
innocent or accused of all this you'd

833
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:08,430
be out of your fucking mind.

834
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,460
It's so weird to even think about
it since it's so sick and gross.

835
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:21,110
This is so few things in life that
disturb people more than someone taking

836
00:32:21,991 --> 00:32:22,890
advantage of children.

837
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,880
Oh I know that the whole futures that
kids futures fuck you poising that kid's

838
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:27,270
mind.

839
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,440
That's the one thing in prison.

840
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,660
They say that child molesters
get their ass kicked.

841
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,050
Yeah of course because a lot of people
out there a lot of people to torture

842
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:39,051
victims you know as children they can
they said I love when people go I hope

843
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:41,740
they do that to him in jail
but it's gonna to fuck him.

844
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,010
They look at stretched out Grace.

845
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,173
Oh.

846
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,960
I think they're going to kill him
if he goes in general population.

847
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:49,320
Yeah.

848
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,230
They beat him to death.

849
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,490
Sixty nine now right.

850
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,180
Yeah.

851
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,800
Yeah.

852
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,300
And then they put him if they put him in
you know silent solitary in isolation.

853
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,160
I mean it seems like they're
just going to convict him.

854
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,130
I mean it just it seems like the
evidence is pretty overwhelming.

855
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,800
I mean really the problem is with these
kind of trials it has to be a hundred

856
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:05,634
percent.

857
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:09,750
It can't be a hung jury if one person
is not sure then they have to do a

858
00:33:09,751 --> 00:33:10,320
retrial.

859
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,970
This one seems so crazy though it almost
knee requires a second case it requires

860
00:33:14,971 --> 00:33:19,320
him to be guilty and then you to go
back to the whole school and everyone

861
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:22,600
involved you fucked in you see well
that's gonna come down after this.

862
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,280
The president the guys
who resign are gonna.

863
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,090
Yeah.

864
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,060
They have their day in court.

865
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,930
Most paternal is dead right.

866
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,340
Did he die.

867
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,570
Yeah.

868
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,403
He died.

869
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,370
That killed them too.

870
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,380
I mean he had cancer but I mean he
would have he would have fought it.

871
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,150
He just was of course a beaten man.

872
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,820
I mean what a terrible position to be in.

873
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:43,140
You know I didn't have it all those
years at an incredible success and he was

874
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:47,730
king of Nittany Valley you know
Penn State and then boom fuck man.

875
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,160
It just shows you the Santa fucking movie.

876
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,640
And movie.

877
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,640
This world is strange it operates it's
fucking strange and you know they're

878
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:58,140
famous for their linebackers.

879
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,530
They call the linebacker you and he you
know who was the coach the linebackers.

880
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,660
Sandusky asking.

881
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,840
You know he was a nice.

882
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,920
He was an aura of revered
revered revered revered

883
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,640
coach.

884
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,600
Don't let him turn into
Irwin Corey remember.

885
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,060
I feel he was rabid.

886
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,400
Wow that's nuts.

887
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,540
Well there's a lot of guys who do really
good at coaching because they really

888
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:22,374
like men.

889
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,550
Makes sense right.

890
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:24,863
Yeah well.

891
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,030
Well you know he's really
looking out for him.

892
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:27,560
Yeah.

893
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,910
People put themselves in situations
like that's what's scary about it.

894
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,960
Some people really do love kids and
they love to see them successful.

895
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,710
I mean I was a great fourth grade
teacher because I fucking love the kids.

896
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,230
I told them my son I don't care.

897
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,290
I just do it you know.

898
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,730
I want you to be happy.

899
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,310
I self-esteem you learn this shit.

900
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:44,700
Great.

901
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,260
I said but let me tell you
you're never gonna be in this.

902
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,380
Some of this math is such bullshit.

903
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,590
I said you're not going to be in a bind
go Man if I only knew the Pythagorean

904
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:56,310
theorem I get that it is charming and
it's better they have they're happy right.

905
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,000
You know I just learned it's past marks
because I don't wanna get in trouble.

906
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,750
But basically I want you to go to the gym.

907
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,603
Have fun in life.

908
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,953
You know.

909
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:05,663
A good teacher.

910
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,990
That's a great advice if you don't want
be mathematicians for the rest of this

911
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,430
year.

912
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,330
Mastery issues are going
to come out anyway.

913
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,500
Kids that are a eggheads who are brilliant
at it you know you just shouldn't

914
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:19,090
force kids like that
like me who had nothing.

915
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,170
Is it possible to teach really
complex things that just make it fun.

916
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,850
Yeah yeah.

917
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,470
The only thing they couldn't understand.

918
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,890
I could never get through to the kids
was the relativity of up and down.

919
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,060
Now there's no absolute up or down it's
relative to a point because we're in the

920
00:35:33,061 --> 00:35:33,450
universe.

921
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,050
Yeah.

922
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,600
I mean like you know we're you
know like people go Well that's it.

923
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,720
They don't understand how people
in Australia are not upside down.

924
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:40,410
Right.

925
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:40,680
Right.

926
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,510
And I could never explain that.

927
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,750
It was from a relative point but
they're only nine 10 years old.

928
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,620
Right.

929
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,010
Well it is hard to grasp the
whole organic spaceship thing.

930
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:50,690
Oh yeah.

931
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,450
That we were all floating in here and we
will we're looking for land looking for

932
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:57,890
property Dom looking to settle down
put a house down in this primary.

933
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,350
Now there's nothing permanent stupid.

934
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,080
The whole earth is a convertible.

935
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,720
Yeah it's flying through the universe or
a convertible that can be easily hit by

936
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,060
another convertible.

937
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:06,610
Yeah.

938
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,620
They and it happens.

939
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,900
That's the whole theory
about the moon's creation.

940
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:15,170
The most recent theory is that there
was earth one and Earth one was like a

941
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,470
fiery fuckin ball of flame or
whatever the fuck it was different.

942
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,590
I don't what it was about it was
different than Earth 2 but it got hit by

943
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:23,424
another planet.

944
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,970
And that created the moon and changed
the whole orbit of Earth and changed the

945
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:30,030
atmosphere and that's the reason
why everything exists today.

946
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:35,060
I mean the reason why we're able to
sustain life because our temperature is

947
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:40,020
remarkably consistent because of the
fact that we have a moon you know is it.

948
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,530
Yeah.

949
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,580
I don't know how it stays
within a couple degrees.

950
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,110
Yeah.

951
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,950
That's part of it.

952
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,120
Part of it is the moon.

953
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,500
The moon keeps our orbit really steady
somewhere or another like its gravity

954
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:50,070
interactions.

955
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,970
I don't understand it.

956
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,690
I don't understand gravity I mean we're
supposed to understand what makes things

957
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:58,000
float in space what makes
things stick to those things.

958
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,110
I used to have a fear when I went to
the beach that I would be sucked up into

959
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:03,940
the air and gravity
wouldn't work just for me.

960
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,580
I saw it just that day.

961
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,290
All of a sudden I'm going Fuck gravity.

962
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,153
Thanks a lot.

963
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,233
I can't get there.

964
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,290
Gravity is a crazy thing to wrap your
head around that there's stuff floating

965
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:17,160
when you get outside of the gravity of
the Earth so you pass a certain distance

966
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:20,540
from the earth where it no longer
pulls on you you can float.

967
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,410
Yeah like the earth has not that far.

968
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,230
Not that far.

969
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,310
So a few hundred miles right.

970
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,770
I mean I mean I mean
30 miles or something.

971
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,810
Yeah I think it's yeah just as
soon as you get out of there.

972
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,970
How many miles is making things up there.

973
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,710
Three hundred miles is like space shuttle.

974
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,540
That's like that's what the space.

975
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh it's the space shuttle.

976
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,950
They go to like 250 300 miles.

977
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,610
They go like somewhere around one man's
crazy and then they you know obviously

978
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,060
that's where the space station is you can
float around up there but I don't know

979
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,250
like at what height
you can start floating.

980
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:54,740
When you come crashing to your death
and what high can you just float around

981
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,623
that causes.

982
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,280
That's a real fine line man.

983
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,310
I was doing a roast with who's the
first man on the moon Neil Armstrong.

984
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,600
Armstrong I think was the owner
of Jones was one of those guys.

985
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,170
Buzz Buzz Aldrin Buzz Aldrin.

986
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,030
I was a member of the Friars Club.

987
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:13,040
Really I did a roast and I remember
saying like What the fuck could scare you.

988
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,840
You've been to the moon right.

989
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,590
And I imagined sitting in a ship
going boys were off to the moon today.

990
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,740
If you really went to the moon to
do it a second was it a Disney film.

991
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,520
Joe are you telling us that nobody
ever really went to the moon.

992
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,040
I think it's very possible
that people went to the moon.

993
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,230
It's also very possible
they faked the whole thing.

994
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,920
Well if they did it was
like a best orgasm ever.

995
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,270
They did a good job.

996
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,800
They got us all excited.

997
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,070
People think I'm retarded for taking this
in their right I am retarded it's not

998
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,410
retarded and how special.

999
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,633
Thank you.

1000
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:51,850
Like uh like what is your
name special so special.

1001
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,190
Who does that song like to have a touch.

1002
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,433
Oh yeah.

1003
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,340
Patton fuck the pretenders.

1004
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,533
Oh no.

1005
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,830
No not the pretenders.

1006
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,460
Yeah I think it wasn't pretend it wasn't.

1007
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,683
It was.

1008
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,970
Fuck I can't remember them now.

1009
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,290
What was Tom Petty's band the
Heartbreakers Heartbreakers.

1010
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,670
What I think he was a pretender

1011
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,053
heartbreaker.

1012
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,960
Yes I used to work with him when
the old Garry Shandling Show.

1013
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,863
Well really I.

1014
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,520
Tom Petty is a Beatle songs together.

1015
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,270
I remember when I was a kid.

1016
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,340
I was about 13 years old and this girl
was telling me how cute she thought Tom

1017
00:39:29,341 --> 00:39:30,174
Petty was.

1018
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,090
And I'll never forget that
sounds like Tom Petty.

1019
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,320
Chrissy Hines Chrissy Hines thank you.

1020
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:39,240
And I was like Tom Petty is such a bad
motherfucker that this girls they think

1021
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:39,940
he's cute.

1022
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,300
Well because he's like cute ugly
because he's talented that's so true.

1023
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,610
It's the advantage of being a man.

1024
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,590
You think any guy goes Susan Boyle.

1025
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,230
And loud bang her.

1026
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,330
We get all the fucking awards she's won.

1027
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,990
Well there's a few dudes out there
that will marry you know famous famous

1028
00:39:54,991 --> 00:39:55,824
monsters.

1029
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,400
There's a few girls that'll do that.

1030
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,880
That'll pick up like a good looking guy.

1031
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,050
It's kind of lost.

1032
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:01,570
Yeah.

1033
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,760
Yes that happens.

1034
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:03,510
That does happen.

1035
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,343
You get in limbo.

1036
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,050
This girls at us powerful
women that have him both.

1037
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,000
I've seen that shit but
it's not as common now.

1038
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,070
Not even close.

1039
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,593
Not even close.

1040
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,930
The women will genuinely legitimately
be attracted to some like really

1041
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:17,160
successful gross guys.

1042
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,023
Thank you.

1043
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:23,530
I appreciate the garb for
ourselves set me up it wasn't.

1044
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,400
I know you had something
to say about the subject.

1045
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,400
It's a weird thing.

1046
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,410
Thank God we're meant to be a woman.

1047
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,070
Yes.

1048
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,740
Much more difficult really difficult.

1049
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:38,580
I mean the whole thing about
makeup and getting ready.

1050
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,700
Oh I was out of fucking.

1051
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,660
I was on my own I want
to say where it was.

1052
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:48,620
I ran into a woman that was very hot in
the 1970s and now she's uh you know now

1053
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:55,590
she's get along in her age and she's
got all this plastic surgery and shit.

1054
00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:00,030
And it was so weird to see some famous
person I wanna say your name not Joan

1055
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:00,690
Rivers.

1056
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,530
I won't say it now wasn't Joan Joan
Rivers looks like a cat now like a space

1057
00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:05,364
cat.

1058
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,440
This looks like an alien.

1059
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,230
Sounds scary.

1060
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,160
It's weird option.

1061
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,340
Yeah and I wonder if what she's
doing that that's permanent.

1062
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,440
Can you can you know it's permanent.

1063
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,303
Yeah it's permanent.

1064
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:18,510
You can't like relax and stop stop doing
what you're doing that makes your face

1065
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,130
like that.

1066
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,960
No I remember I work with
somebody who I love who I did.

1067
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,790
I don't want to really go into it but
she had had plastic surgery and kept

1068
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,600
denying it.

1069
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,480
Yeah when she smiled her when
she left her face didn't move.

1070
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,333
She'd go.

1071
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,923
Oh yeah.

1072
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,820
Gary does that Botox.

1073
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:36,630
Yeah.

1074
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:40,800
Could we both times to you shooting
you shooting a poison in your face.

1075
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,250
Oh yeah.

1076
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:46,250
A guy who used to work and he
used to run a casino in Vegas.

1077
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:51,620
He had Botox and he was going give me
an emotion I go happiness go it goes you

1078
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,850
never make a face good move his face.

1079
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,410
Why does that look better.

1080
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,090
Well it just looks tighter.

1081
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,030
I don't know it looks bad.

1082
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,550
I think you just gotta deal with the
fact that you're getting older bitch.

1083
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,150
Yeah that's such shit is just weird.

1084
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,310
I it get some Botox for
my girlfriend's pussy.

1085
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,833
Oh man.

1086
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,610
You don't say much but when you come
in Bam the show we realize while you're

1087
00:42:11,611 --> 00:42:16,080
here that true talent shines and
you feel the hope the showcase too.

1088
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,450
When he made that confident.

1089
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,300
He swings a lot of pitches and I'm
trying to get him to calm down to play.

1090
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,380
That was my 3 p.m.

1091
00:42:22,381 --> 00:42:24,690
hold that was your 3 p.m.

1092
00:42:24,691 --> 00:42:27,120
hold because I heard
Don had it leave at 3 0.

1093
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,113
You have to leave at 3.

1094
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,090
I can do another 15 minutes.

1095
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,450
All right.

1096
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,970
No 10 10 15.

1097
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,873
That's why you did it.

1098
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,140
Really planned it out.

1099
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,880
You are a smart man.

1100
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,230
I take it back.

1101
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,670
I just sort of like a
suicide bomber for podcasts.

1102
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:47,520
You see the difference is your
podcast available on iTunes.

1103
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:48,980
I think it is and what isn't.

1104
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,183
Is it under.

1105
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,010
He started with laugh
factory damn rare live.

1106
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,950
So now it's time I rear
live at the Laugh Factory.

1107
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,200
We should figure out how these
people can find this time.

1108
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,310
How did they find out.

1109
00:42:59,310 --> 00:42:59,780
I should.

1110
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,613
That should be better.

1111
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,030
Did you ask me about the Tropicana
I shouldn't have to call it.

1112
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,460
Yeah I better get over
I've got a decent present.

1113
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:09,810
Yeah well you're one of the
great comedians of our era
and you're out here with

1114
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:14,040
a barely functional website and
very little Twitter presence.

1115
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,140
I know.

1116
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,060
Do you use Twitter now.

1117
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,280
I see you have a habit.

1118
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,250
Yeah my my god daughter
moved in with me yesterday.

1119
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,340
So with her live in there
she's gonna keep me updated.

1120
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,390
Oh that's great.

1121
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,510
Yeah you go beautiful.

1122
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:26,930
You can't do it yourself.

1123
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:30,480
Where at if given up on the fact
that the idea of doing it yourself.

1124
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:34,800
I've done it myself at times but you
know my thing is I have mostly sports

1125
00:43:34,801 --> 00:43:38,340
things that come to my head like that
Bill Bird of sports shit all the time.

1126
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,710
And people get mad at him.

1127
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,930
Oh man on full use do one more sports.

1128
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,490
Call it fact it gets real mad at you.

1129
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,710
Yeah you do his show he's fun.

1130
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,250

00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,170
It was great.

1133
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,320
He's terrific and yeah

1134
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,780
He's done the Icehouse Chronicles one

1135
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,320
That is the most fun he's done the
way he done Icehouse Chronicles.

1136
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,280
Did you know.

1137
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,900

1161
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,810

1162
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:49,530
The crowds are.

1163
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,670
It's all podcast fans now.

1164
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,020
I was talking to Bob Fisher.

1165
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,600
He was saying when you
tell the people to come.

1166
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,320
Well I said I was you on a Wednesday
night at midnight and there's no club in

1167
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,154
the city it's packed.

1168
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,860
And Wednesday night had been amazing.

1169
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,870
It was sold out too.

1170
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,510
And that is so fun.

1171
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,630
The crowds are amazing and
we've got some great fans smart.

1172
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,940
I'm saying they're smart
because they laugh at us.

1173
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,070
Well we're super lucky.

1174
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,970
You know I don't know why we pulled it
off somehow or another but it's it's by.

1175
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:19,600
Its by its by what those guys in
Ireland were saying it's fine just.

1176
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,840
Telling people you know what's helped you.

1177
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,940
Telling people what you're
what you're really into.

1178
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:25,770
Stop pretending.

1179
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:26,980
Everybody tell the goddamn truth.

1180
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:31,750
My nephew is 20 and he he's never been
more excited about me being on anything.

1181
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,460
Since Hey Arnold.

1182
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:34,480
Right.

1183
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,960
When he was a kid it's like you know
cause they don't really relate to it like

1184
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,900
everybody loves Raymond and Seinfeld and
all they don't relate to any of those

1185
00:45:40,901 --> 00:45:44,140
credits they would love this
they live like you with the top.

1186
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,320
You know I am a guy who's funny and
may have me the American Medical

1187
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:52,084
Association.

1188
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,090
See I've got to have a good act.

1189
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,700
Joe thank you for your therapy.

1190
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,230
Well that's awesome.

1191
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:04,230
Well if anything we could do to to you
know make this world a little bit better

1192
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:05,464
places.

1193
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,520
Help the young man help the young men
that are coming up to give him some sort

1194
00:46:09,521 --> 00:46:12,970
of fucking perspective that's different
than the one they're getting every day

1195
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,990
either at work or at school or in the
media getting this perspective that you

1196
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:18,970
have to be some asshole doesn't exist.

1197
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,130
Yeah some guy who doesn't exist you have
to fuckin you know you have to abide by

1198
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:26,170
their silly laws of political correctness.

1199
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,630
He can't tell the truth he can't.

1200
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,440
He can't be honest about what you like.

1201
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,480
You know it's it's a fucking terrible
place where people have to live in and

1202
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,480
just as shitty state of
despair all the time.

1203
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:38,680
It's not necessary.

1204
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,440
I like to watch two women
sometimes I get a little lazy.

1205
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,950
How do you like what you do.

1206
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,520
Well like a video.

1207
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,230
Well it doesn't really do it for me.

1208
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,880
No no I don't.

1209
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,880
I mean I guess if they were right there
in real life I really was gonna watch.

1210
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,370
I've only seen it once in real life.

1211
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:58,120
I've seen a couple of times but once
that was like a video where they were

1212
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:03,300
actually making a video and it was like
one of the most sexless things I've ever

1213
00:47:03,641 --> 00:47:03,850
seen.

1214
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:04,950
Oh you saw filming it.

1215
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:05,830
Yeah.

1216
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,240
Yeah it was real weird.

1217
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,283
It was.

1218
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,490
They were they were doing one of the
dudes who is a writer for news radio was a

1219
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:13,990
porno writer.

1220
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,003
Oh yeah.

1221
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:15,970
No writer.

1222
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:16,803
He's.

1223
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,190
You think you're gonna score.

1224
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:23,310
He dated a bunch of girls that were in
the business and it was this is a long

1225
00:47:23,501 --> 00:47:23,970
time ago.

1226
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:26,010
It's like we're talking about like ninety.

1227
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,960
Four I guess somewhere and then and he
broke up with his girl because they were

1228
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,270
out at dinner and this is
when reality set into him.

1229
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:41,440
They were out at dinner and she was like
just like really tired and she wasn't

1230
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:45,370
and it was like What's matter is I say
something like Oh no it's just how did

1231
00:47:45,371 --> 00:47:50,371
you know with this guy all day and so
scarred she still can hate that and all he

1232
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:52,780
could think of was I
can't wait till Friday.

1233
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,890
How does that even fit in right
to the world that I'm living in.

1234
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,890
How is it that the woman I love is taken
taken Dick in her ass all day and where

1235
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,410
I know.

1236
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,250
Like what.

1237
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,700
Yeah it's not quite the job I remember
we were at the Riviera Steve Shaw Report

1238
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,580
was there and you know he
did want to go up by me.

1239
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,270
He did what he had.

1240
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,290
Steve is very faithful to his
wife and you know Steve right.

1241
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:13,870
Yeah sure.

1242
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:14,560
And he.

1243
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,800
He tells me you want to go and watch
them chew porn or up in the penthouse.

1244
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:18,520
I'll get chipped.

1245
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,353
I said Yeah I got.

1246
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,850
I go in and this girl's
peeing on this other girl.

1247
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,550
I go wow this is romantic.

1248
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:25,930
Where are they in the tub or something.

1249
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:26,800
Yeah.

1250
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,260
And then that night we had.

1251
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:33,410
We went up there and me and Sophie Sophie
wanted to see my girlfriend you know.

1252
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,260
And the girls needed so much attention
when they weren't getting attention as

1253
00:48:38,261 --> 00:48:41,290
one girl lays down on the piano it's
because you want to see my trick.

1254
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:45,010
And she put a you know
this is a cigar holder.

1255
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:48,730
Like a little capsule that they
put cigars in like a metal thing.

1256
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,140
She put it inside of her and she popped
it out but she shot it so hard it

1257
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:54,110
fucking hurt the girls.

1258
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,340
Farhad You stay in there.

1259
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,040
Go go go go.

1260
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:01,990
Do you imagine the block
left a permanent mark.

1261
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,250
What happened to you.

1262
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,270
I don't wanna talk about it.

1263
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,570
Oh shit.

1264
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,280
Jesus Christ.

1265
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:10,510
Yeah.

1266
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,940
But you're right about having the wife
and you know a husband and wife and when

1267
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,030
one of them does porn and the other
doesn't and both the US weird is weird.

1268
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,160
So this dude took me to the set and
these girls were doing it and it was Jill

1269
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:29,101
Kelley and Janine sadly did
say you know who both the fan.

1270
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:31,630
They're both beautiful
Janine is really yeah.

1271
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,310
And this was back in the day.

1272
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,830
She only had no she had any tattoos.

1273
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,470
Maybe she had a couple but now
she's like fully sleeved and shit.

1274
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,330
Oh yeah I know.

1275
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:41,160
Yeah it's weird but.

1276
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:43,780
And they were just two
girls like each other out.

1277
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:47,860
So I was like this is just so strange
it feels so that the music and the whole

1278
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:52,420
the whole thing while watching the camera
you know circle them and seeing the

1279
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:54,470
lights and the guy with the boom mike.

1280
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,320
I was like This is so odd.

1281
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,880
It just seems so strange.

1282
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,230
Anybody got the gum.

1283
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,590
It was just real close.

1284
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,600
Well it's almost like
clinical or something yeah.

1285
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:08,200
Of course it didn't seem like you know
like if these are two girls and they

1286
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:11,110
would just sit on the couch and all a
sudden one girl just started eating the

1287
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:11,944
girls acid below.

1288
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,840
Well what the fuck.

1289
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,580
Like you'd be nervous right.

1290
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,270
Like what is happening here.

1291
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,440
This is crazy.

1292
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,360
But to watch it like to go and like
it's sort of orchestrated an action.

1293
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:24,160
OK.

1294
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,610
You know I want two fingers now.

1295
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,040
OK.

1296
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,873
Yeah.

1297
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:27,230
Yeah.

1298
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,300
Spit on it spit on.

1299
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,230
Player s.

1300
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,020
Frazier.

1301
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:34,010
I was at the I was at the magic castle
and a friend of mine and this one of the

1302
00:50:34,011 --> 00:50:37,680
dancers from the shirt tour came
in who I knew four years ago.

1303
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:41,420
So I can just say that because there's
so many of them and we go back to my

1304
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:43,490
house and we're by the pool table.

1305
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,880
And Kristie you know my old girlfriend
comes out and I shouldn't say her name.

1306
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,700
Well it doesn't matter
it's not her last name.

1307
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:51,703
Still love you.

1308
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:57,590
And she has puke breast and she took her
bra off and just had a T-shirt on there

1309
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:02,150
sticking straight out and the girl just
casually walks over to her lips and

1310
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:03,003
starts sucking it.

1311
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:08,180
Oh and me and my friend Ali would
just like they're like holy shit.

1312
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:09,590
And you know.

1313
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,103
I mean.

1314
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,110
Russell Peters always does that joke
about like acting like he's gonna jerk you

1315
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:15,970
up as a joke.

1316
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:18,470
We say we take care you date tough guy.

1317
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,200
And I mean that is just so odd.

1318
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:26,480
And it was sexy to a point and then one
of the girls wanted to go down the other

1319
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:26,720
one.

1320
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,670
That's right Julie line.

1321
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:32,660
Imagine if there was so as many like
really openly bisexual men as there were

1322
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,150
openly bisexual just
different it's different.

1323
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,210
Well it's different because it's bullshit
because a lot of them aren't really

1324
00:51:38,211 --> 00:51:38,900
bisexual.

1325
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,460
Some of them are.

1326
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,440
For sure you are just a lot of women a..

1327
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,140
I'm saying they're fake
and not an act for us now.

1328
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:48,500
Zee Don't break my family and
there's no stigma attached to it.

1329
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:49,520
No social stigma.

1330
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:53,630
You know some girls genuinely like girls
of course but there's a lot of fake

1331
00:51:53,631 --> 00:51:54,500
lesbians out there.

1332
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,340
We all know that.

1333
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:59,380
I know the girls are in the porn
that our girls are all real.

1334
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,670
I mean yeah yeah I mean all
that although a lot of them.

1335
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,090
Yeah.

1336
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:03,970
Not all those girls you
can't say most of us.

1337
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:06,110
I mean if they if they're
not gay they tell you.

1338
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,530
Well I'm not talking about girls that
are like into hardcore sex either.

1339
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:12,550
I'm talking about girls like making out
with girls in bars and chilling out.

1340
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:13,910
Well they don't actually do anything.

1341
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:14,390
Oh yeah.

1342
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,570
Yes a lot of that going on
when they're doing a fashion.

1343
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,730
Well you ever hear of lugs lugs lugs.

1344
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:24,930
It's a phrase in high school and
college girls use it's lesbian until

1345
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:25,934
graduation.

1346
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:26,630
No.

1347
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:26,960
Yeah.

1348
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,280
And like a lot some girls too.

1349
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,950
Well I just I'm one of my
friend's daughters is a lug.

1350
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:32,863
Really.

1351
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:36,190
She said she's so going to be
a lesbian till she graduates.

1352
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:36,740
Wow.

1353
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,570
And then what happens graduates the cock.

1354
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:39,680
I don't know.

1355
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,440
I don't know what happens but I give
you that you'll raise your eyebrows.

1356
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:47,783
That's hilarious.

1357
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,530
Yeah.

1358
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:48,950
Wow.

1359
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:53,030
Lesbian until I've heard gay for the
stay for guys are going into prison.

1360
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,680
Oh really.

1361
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:53,870
Yeah.

1362
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:54,380
You never heard that.

1363
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:54,950
No.

1364
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:57,710
They go gay while they're in
prison only just gay for the stay.

1365
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,810
Yeah well you never heard that Brian.

1366
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,690
No we don't watch enough
Mexican gang movies.

1367
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,900
You don't watch enough Mexican gay porn.

1368
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,370
Settle down.

1369
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:08,630
I don't think there exists.

1370
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:09,710
Does it.

1371
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:10,220
Yes.

1372
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:10,550
Yeah.

1373
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:11,870
You know because you're watching.

1374
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:17,050
Oh it's oh I've tricked you a Jew
you into my less than obvious.

1375
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:18,383
Well here.

1376
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:19,650
Yeah.

1377
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:20,483
Okay

1378
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,690
I got you in a gay trap.

1379
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,020
Felons gay spears.

1380
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:30,720
Dominic Joseph thank you for having me on.

1381
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,030
Always a pleasure my friend.

1382
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:32,990
We got to do this more often.

1383
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:33,690
Definitely.

1384
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:37,640
We're back to playing pool at least once
a month it seems like I'm back after

1385
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:40,440

the Atlantic City gig come back.

1386
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,470

1387
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,370
Then we'll all be here
for at least a month.

1388
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,590
Beautiful What are you What

What he got going on this week.

1390
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:51,730
This week I'm doing a thing for all the
radio guys in Miami Beach like all the

1391
00:53:53,031 --> 00:53:53,720
disc jockeys.

1392
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,720
It's called a boot camp
for all the morning hosts.

1393
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:00,200
Oh yeah that's that'll be fun
because what do you what is it.

1394
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:00,680
What do you do.

1395
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,513
I just do standup.

1396
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,930
I mean it is like a show.

1397
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:06,710
I mean like well I'm the show just
to give them a break from all that.

1398
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,573
It's like a convention.

1399
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:11,060
Oh I see I see and then they hire
comedians to come and perform at the

1400
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:11,894
convention.

1401
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,880
Oh I didn't even know that this jockey's
have conventions like that you know.

1402
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:17,120
I mean I'd heard about
it but I never saw it.

1403
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,800
Why don't we have a fucking convention.

1404
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:19,780
Why not.

1405
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,390
What we should have a fucking man.

1406
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,960
We need we we need a
death squad celebration.

1407
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,490
That's what Montreal is like.

1408
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,760
Well it would be then I'd
love hanging out with you.

1409
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,410
Montreal is.

1410
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:30,170
That's the short.

1411
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,400
That's one one place.

1412
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,610
That's that's what a jet like
celebration and gathering of comedians.

1413
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,473
Yeah.

1414
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,170
After a while I stopped doing it because
it was like it would kind of cost you

1415
00:54:39,171 --> 00:54:40,004
money.

1416
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:44,480
You know like I if I spend like a week
and a half in a place I can't spend that

1417
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:45,314
much time away.

1418
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:46,070
You got it.

1419
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:46,660
Yeah you're.

1420
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,500
Well you know you created your own niche.

1421
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,370
You're smart.

1422
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,350
I mean you never let go.

1423
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:51,710
That's so I'm surprised
you're going to Brazil.

1424
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,210
Well I like working for the UFC too.

1425
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,553
You know I don't.

1426
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,670
I think I think you can do
more than one thing in life.

1427
00:54:59,300 --> 00:54:59,560
Yeah.

1428
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,400
No I'm not happy when
I'm doing like only one.

1429
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:02,263
I agree.

1430
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,830
I told you I'm doing Raging Bull.

1431
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,720
Next week when I got a one day
shoot I'm playing Joey Lewis.

1432
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,110
Raging Bull too.

1433
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:10,610
Yeah.

1434
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:14,840
Now you know I know first of all I guess
Jake LaMotta must have all the rights

1435
00:55:14,841 --> 00:55:17,330
to to his obviously to his own life.

1436
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:19,960
Oh because I don't know how
they could do it without him.

1437
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,470
He knows that it's under his auspices
but like you know it doesn't seem like

1438
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:26,720
Raging Bull to me without
the Nero and Scorsese.

1439
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:27,660
But I heard the script.

1440
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,700
The script was really good.

1441
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,610
Michael boss who's doing it
who's director Zac Efron is uh

1442
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:39,500
you know chasing beaver as
Spencer Pratt as you said.

1443
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,120
Did you look it up.

1444
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,880
Who's in it.

1445
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,640
I think it's on.

1446
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:45,950
That funny though.

1447
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,050
One day with the.

1448
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:50,200
Day at the Tropicana
one day raging bull too.

1449
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:50,670
Yeah.

1450
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:54,910
So this raging bull too What is it
with the is it like his later life.

1451
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,690
I think it's an OK thing.

1452
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,160
Yeah.

1453
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:57,993
Please him.

1454
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:58,930

00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:00,183
Joe Bologna.

1457
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:03,070
It looks like there's a
guy named Joe Bologna.

1458
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:06,130
You never heard John say it like that.

1459
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,610
Well I mean William forced baloney.

1460
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,930
The Bologna baloney.

1461
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:14,150
It's like he didn't call a
baloney but below Italy's.

1462
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:14,920
Yeah.

00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:18,840
I know that Italy is a city but
that city and go fuck yourself.

1466
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,640
That's baloney.

a death squad boycott.

That looks like it's designed
to rob children of their brains.

1509
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,490
It sucks your brain out.

1510
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:15,910

Cartoons is amazing.

1517
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,200

You're on.

1521
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,990

John.

1528
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,810
He's a hilarious comic
and knows the other one.

1529
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,220
Hey Arnold.

1530
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,000
I mentioned that earlier.

1531
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,160
Yeah.

1532
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,050
What was Hey Arnold again.

1533
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,070
Hey Arnold was Gray's kid
with the football head.

1534
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:58,480
Remember that hit like a football
head and he was he lived in it.

1535
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,060
He lived in a boarding house.

1536
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:04,240
He didn't have parents but
his grandparents and all
the people loved him and

1537
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:05,074
took care of him.

1538
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,960
And I was when I was Ernie
Potts demolition guy.

1539
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:10,000
I forgot to level it today.

1540
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:12,380
He wanted to level
everything that's Hey Arnold.

1541
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:14,440
He's like Stewie but grown up.

1542
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,950
Do you like doing like a
little kid shows and cartoon.

1543
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:18,820
Oh yeah.

1544
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,270
It's fun.

1545
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:22,570
It's such a great contrast from
my lives in nightclubs you know.

1546
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:22,920
Right.

1547
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,200
Right.

1548
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,033
Right.

1549
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:24,760
It's fun.

1550
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,090

Instagram can eat.

1584
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:56,960
Brian says Instagram can eat his dick.

1585
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:57,950

I like Facebook.

1589
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:03,980
Why do you hate Facebook.

1590
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:04,843
Facebook is lame.

1591
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,960
Rude dumping mean it's
also Facebook slime.

01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,660
Be a hater.

1597
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:16,130
MySpace isn't even boring.

1598
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:16,993
How about that.

1599
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,070

1600
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:20,053

1601
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,520
So you haven't felt the league lately.

1602

You don't like Facebook
as much like oh I don't.

1603
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,080
Now I know it's already
turning into MySpace for me.

1604
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,400
I like getting good at it you know.

1605

where they should be at 14.

1617
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:47,773
It should be OK.
