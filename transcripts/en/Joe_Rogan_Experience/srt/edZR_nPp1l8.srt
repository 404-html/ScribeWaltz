1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,560
Here we go.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,393
Five,

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,150
four,

4
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,983
three,

5
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,853
two,

6
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:07,723
one.

7
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:08,781
First of all,

8
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:11,360
how many people get your name wrong
when they try to pronounce it?

9
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,350
Well,

10
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,011
so many people,

11
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:14,030
I don't even care anymore.

12
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,330
I just had it where it comes
out and cause I live in,

13
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:18,920
it's a funny name where I come from,

14
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,230
right from England who
grown up was a funny name,

15
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,740
but in Mexico is even stranger names.

16
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:25,400
So I just normally make it Ian,

17
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,590
I my second name Grillo,

18
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,570
which in Spanish is glio.

19
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,230
Right.

20
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,100
So everyone,

21
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:32,000
I messed that up too.

22
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:33,460
If they see it spelled yes.

23
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,270
A microphone about a fist from your face.

24
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:35,481
Right.

25
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:36,314
There we go.

26
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,473
Um,

27
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,780
Yo on,

28
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:40,100
I don't think I've ever
heard that name before.

29
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,900
Does enact a call young referred?

30
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,010
Was he in?

31
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,480
He's in fantastic four.

32
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,170
Oh really?

33
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,220
He's the stretchy guy.

34
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,461
Oh,

35
00:00:46,461 --> 00:00:47,000
no shit.

36
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,930
In fantastic four.

37
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:48,261
So yeah,

38
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:48,770
he kind of,

39
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,270
he's made that name a little bit more,

40
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,320
a little bit more acceptable.

41
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,360
Um,

42
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,580
how did you wind up living in Mexico City?

43
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:01,090
So I came to Mexico or went to
Mexico and the year 2000 and uh,

44
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,210
I'll kind of messed around
for a few years in the UK.

45
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,010
What did the game to journalism.

46
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,900
So I found one way to get into it was
to start working in a foreign country

47
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,860
rather than going to my local newspaper
and work and go to a foreign country and

48
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:16,694
start working.

49
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,300
And I had a romantic idea about
Latin America thinking I'd be like,

50
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,650
I saw the movie Salvador.

51
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,580
Ah,

52
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:22,821
you know,

53
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:24,470
Oliver Stone's movie from the 80s.

54
00:01:24,471 --> 00:01:24,921
I kind of had a,

55
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:25,251
had a,

56
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,160
had a romantic idea about
running around with grillers,

57
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,270
um,

58
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,770
fighting military dictatorships.

59
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,970
So I arrived in Mexico
in 2000 and got a job at,

60
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:36,260
I had an English language newspaper.

61
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,100
How old were you?

62
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,260
27 when I first left the UK.

63
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:39,500
Yeah,

64
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,091
28 when I,

65
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:41,810
I messed around for a
bit in Mexico as well,

66
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,040
and then got the job when I was 28.

67
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,690
Mexico City is a wild place.

68
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:44,921
Yeah.

69
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:45,300
Yeah.

70
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,400
It's so packed.

71
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:46,651
It's,

72
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:47,181
it's hard to,

73
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:49,370
I've only been there
twice for a UFC events,

74
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,350
but every time I'm there
I'm just shaking my head.

75
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:52,940
Like I can't believe
how it's traffic works.

76
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:53,774
It's crazy.

77
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,321
Yeah.

78
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:55,030
18 years.

79
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,311
Nothing.

80
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:56,450
A lot of time in that traffic.

81
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,890
Nobody cares about red lights,

82
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,521
green lights,

83
00:01:58,521 --> 00:01:59,150
they don't care.

84
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,940
It's stressful.

85
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,550
Everyone who wants to
cut you up all the time.

86
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,270
Yeah.

87
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,380
People shout at you a lot.

88
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,850
You'd have to get used to people
calling you like Ben Deco cerebral.

89
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,010
I tried different tactics,

90
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:11,660
not just try and relax and not get angry.

91
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,550
Did you know how to speak
Spanish before you went there?

92
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,031
Yeah,

93
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:16,760
so I spent one year in Spain
living in Spain before I went.

94
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,290
Now I spent a year in
the Middle East as well.

95
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,430
Um,

96
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,390
and uh,

97
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,591
but yeah,

98
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:23,780
I started off when I arrived
I spoke more to Spanish,

99
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:24,141
Spanish,

100
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:25,880
which is like all yet DLC on your deal.

101
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,580
And then I changed more to
like the Mexican Spanish,

102
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,414
which was like,

103
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:29,911
oh,

104
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:30,411
your way.

105
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:31,310
Keep us all away.

106
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:31,941
Right,

107
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:32,181
right,

108
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:32,810
right.

109
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,643
Yeah.

110
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,730
So when did you start getting
into narco journalism?

111
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,010
So like I arrived to say with the
romantic idea about what I might cover in,

112
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:43,251
in,

113
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:43,430
uh,

114
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,430
in Mexico or Latin America and right
away realize all that idea of grillers in

115
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:50,630
military dictatorships that have gone.

116
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:51,740
That was the last century.

117
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,490
Mm.

118
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,180
Che Guevara,

119
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,050
all that stuff had gone.

120
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,570
But right away when I arrived,

121
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,453
my very first off,

122
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,150
first I back in the UK,

123
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,880
grew up around a lot of drugs in the UK.

124
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,720
So going back to the eighties,

125
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,390
I grew up a lot,

126
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,460
people taking drugs.

127
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,990
I had a few friends who died from heroin
overdoses back then for people I knew

128
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,010
died of heroin overdoses.

129
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,860
I had a sister who went to,

130
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,090
became a schizophrenia smoking a lot of,

131
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,770
a lot of went up.

132
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,161
She was,

133
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:22,270
became script schizophrenia.

134
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,450
Can their bill of drugs being
smoked around that time as well?

135
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,733
Was it pot?

136
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,670
Yeah,

137
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,770
back then it was a Moroccan hashish.

138
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,451
There's,

139
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:30,601
there,

140
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:31,780
there is a connection,

141
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:32,471
you know,

142
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:34,510
and we've been exploring
that a lot lately.

143
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:34,850
Um,

144
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,160
we,

145
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,100
we went into this,

146
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:36,580
uh,

147
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,380
marijuana debate between,

148
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:39,214
um,

149
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:39,671
uh,

150
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:44,671
Alex Borenstein and I'm Dr. Mike Hart
from Canada and we talked about it and I

151
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:49,600
know people that have had that happen to
them where they've had schizophrenia or

152
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:53,980
a psychotic breaks because of
just massive doses of marijuana.

153
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,810
And especially people that don't do it
or people that do it too much for too

154
00:03:58,811 --> 00:03:59,644
long.

155
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,513
It does happen.

156
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,720
I had that debate.

157
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,910
That's one of the reasons
why it came to mind.

158
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,330
Uh,

159
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:04,691
I mean,

160
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:08,920
I don't know a lot of people smoke weed,

161
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,031
a lot of people.

162
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:10,710
It's fine.

163
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,110
Uh,

164
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,741
now when,

165
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:16,741
when my sister had a breakdown when she
was 18 and I was 16 at a time and when

166
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,221
that came out,

167
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:18,921
it turned out awesome.

168
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:19,051
My,

169
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:19,410
my,

170
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,310
my grandmother had an issue
with schizophrenia and I
think identity as a time

171
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:27,850
bomb waiting to go off or
if it was how much the,

172
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,510
the,

173
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,710
the hatch was involved in that.

174
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,760
There's other issues as well.

175
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,220
So I don't really know the science of it,

176
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:35,290
but Ben way going back.

177
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:35,591
So,

178
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,540
so I've been around a lot of drugs before.

179
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,091
Um,

180
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:39,340
so when I arrived in Mexico,

181
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:40,480
actually one of the first,

182
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:40,900
uh,

183
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,370
first arriving in Mexico,

184
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:43,560
I ended up hanging around with some,

185
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,650
some people and they were
smoking a lot of crack in Mexico.

186
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,060
It's one of some of
the first people I met.

187
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,870
Wow.

188
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,703
Um,

189
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,031
I was,

190
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:52,210
I went down to the beach,

191
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,970
like backpacking down to the beach
and these people were smoking,

192
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:55,631
smoking crack.

193
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:56,021
And I was like,

194
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:56,711
this is kind of strange.

195
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:58,630
I didn't know those people
smoking crack down here.

196
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,470
So when I got a job at the local newspaper
in English and I just started looking

197
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:05,531
at the crime thing,

198
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:09,310
one of the first deals I did was on the
issue of crack being sold locally and

199
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:11,050
how that linked to the cartels.

200
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,480
And then very soon does very,

201
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:13,961
very quick.

202
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:15,220
I just fell in right away.

203
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:15,611
Like I said,

204
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,630
all these things happen by accident.

205
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:21,370
I just fell into covering the crime
beat and this has gone back to 2001.

206
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,540
So 2001,

207
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,720
it was the same year that chapel
was man escaped from prison.

208
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,220
Uh,

209
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,780
then I was calling a lot then to
a great journeys from twiner has,

210
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:32,760
who's plan con ls.

211
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,340
You're a real legend from Tijuana
who survived the shooting by it,

212
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:38,690
by cartels and you know,

213
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,180
phoning him up all the time.

214
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:42,550
Just getting him and had given
me information can be tips.

215
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,260
And that is how it
really started with that.

216
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:44,841
And our big store,

217
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:46,700
I did it back in those days was a,

218
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,390
the court marshal if some
generals for drug trafficking.

219
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,030
And that was really where it began.

220
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,760
That'd been generals for drug traffic.

221
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,230
How much of an issue is that?

222
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,620
Uh,

223
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:56,840
I mean,

224
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,980
corruption must be

225
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,020
unbelievably ramping.

226
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,370
So I mean,

227
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,450
corruption even isn't
necessarily enough word for it.

228
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,630
Sometimes I could state capture,

229
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,810
I'm gonna say this is the real beginning
and it has been a whole crazy 18 years

230
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:12,570
of covering this stuff means
this is the very beginning about,

231
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:13,440
and I've seen a whole lot of,

232
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,300
for a crazy stuff in that time,

233
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,501
but like,

234
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,320
just to get a sense of how bad the
corruption is or what it really means and

235
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:20,391
the,

236
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,480
on the ground level,

237
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,100
they're like,

238
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:24,960
there's a policemen.

239
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,860
Let you interview policemen,

240
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,250
you get to know the
policemen in a certain town,

241
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:30,084
certain city.

242
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,271
Um,

243
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:35,160
and it's hard to know in a hat or military
guys are politicians and you want to

244
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,210
believe these are good people.

245
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:39,510
You want to believe there's good policemen
out there who really want to stop

246
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:40,344
crime.

247
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,790
So there was one policeman,

248
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,130
his nickname was Tice at Dyson,

249
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,420
like Mike Tyson.

250
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,940
His nickname was Tyson because
he was a world built bloke,

251
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,240
well built guy and uh,

252
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,330
he was friendly with depressed
gut from Mitchell can friendly,

253
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,164
would depress.

254
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,080
Um,

255
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,080
and then it came out that he was actually
a drug cartel member ranking member in

256
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:06,990
a drug cartel and he actually confessed,

257
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,260
they,

258
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,670
they used to have a
thing where the police,

259
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,630
the federal police,

260
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:10,231
when they got him,

261
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:13,140
got him to confess on
camera and he confessed.

262
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,330
Not only was he turning a blind eye,

263
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,000
not only was he carrying out murders,

264
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:21,150
he was training the young kids
how to the capitate people,

265
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:22,080
how to cut people up.

266
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,910
And it was expanding in graphic
detail how he like in a,

267
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:28,500
how they managed to cut limbs off.

268
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:32,550
Halle gets young people train the cut
limbs off to get them to lose their fear.

269
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,240
So that's the level of corruption that
could be a policeman you're dealing with

270
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:37,650
and that's really who they are.

271
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,600
Um,

272
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,540
so that's one of the craziest things
about a corruption down there.

273
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,250
Did you have any hazards

274
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,600
Tinsey in getting involved in
narco journalism knowingness?

275
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,670
I mean I would imagine that's
one of the most dangerous

276
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,820
avenues to pursue in journalism.

277
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,710
So this was little by little,

278
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:57,790
I got involved in cover knee,

279
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:58,590
so like,

280
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,030
like going back to 2000
and this hadn't happened,

281
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,140
this war hadn't happened.

282
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,930
It was still like a crime
issue at that moment.

283
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,390
So I began to cover these things.

284
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:12,391
And then around 2004 I got a job for
the Houston chronicle out of Houston,

285
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:12,971
Texas.

286
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:13,804
I was covering,

287
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,080
I was a string of covering Mexico for
them and I flew up to a lot to Nuevo

288
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,680
Laredo and there was a
turf war beginning there,

289
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:25,750
which is really the
beginning of the drug war,

290
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:27,540
which is toward Mexico.

291
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:31,630
Part began on the border with Texas
in this city called Nuevo Laredo.

292
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,310
Over the bridge from Laredo,

293
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,980
Texas back in 2004.

294
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,690
So there was a lot of interest
from the Texas newspapers,

295
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:43,300
what was going on as a whole
bunch of bodies piling up there.

296
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,061
But again,

297
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:47,590
it's going back to these days and
this is kind of innocent looking back,

298
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:47,951
innocent,

299
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:50,860
looking at myself then an innocent
looking at what Mexico is like.

300
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:52,660
Then they would simply say,

301
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:54,640
go to the place I draw up the Monterey,

302
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,410
rent a car and just drive the car to
Norbury either with bus by myself.

303
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,180
And now people just don't do that.

304
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:05,130
This is too much crazy stuff going on.

305
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:07,110
But back then it was still
light or you can just do that.

306
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,791
So there was,

307
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,690
you see crazy stuff.

308
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:10,860
Like what kind of crazy stuff?

309
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,221
I mean,

310
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:14,960
now you can get stopped by an
armed group driving on those roads.

311
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:15,271
He could,

312
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:18,570
you could just drive along and it could
be a group of guys with guns could stop

313
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:18,901
the car,

314
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:19,651
get someone out,

315
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:20,550
takes take your way.

316
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:20,851
I mean,

317
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,880
there's a whole people a
lot more careful about,

318
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,140
you know,

319
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,750
where you are now.

320
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,091
Now when,

321
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:25,230
um,

322
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,310
when you move around the roads,

323
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,800
you can be very careful how you
move and how you plan this stuff.

324
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,600
You don't just wander by yourself.

325
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,430
Dry ran these places.

326
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:33,991
So,

327
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,450
so back then when this
was happening and um,

328
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,561
there was,

329
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:38,394
uh,

330
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,160
this body's turning up and was
trying to figure out why and,

331
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,641
and I,

332
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:41,791
uh,

333
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,180
there was one guy I interviewed who
was a head of chamber of Commerce.

334
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,890
Um,

335
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,161
and uh,

336
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:47,561
talk to me,

337
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:47,700
no,

338
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,533
very interesting guy.

339
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,970
About a couple of weeks later,

340
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:54,270
he became the chief of police for
the city and they asked him and said,

341
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:55,104
are you scared?

342
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,453
Um,

343
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:56,881
you know,

344
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:57,870
you scared about being killed?

345
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:58,021
He said,

346
00:09:58,021 --> 00:09:58,111
no,

347
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:58,660
I'm not scared.

348
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,970
It's under the corrupt
people who get killed.

349
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,100
And he was shot dead six hours
after he gave that statement,

350
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,900
they shot him dead.

351
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,730
And that was one of the real markers.

352
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:10,590
If something really strange
is going on in Mexico,

353
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:13,440
something is like going
to erupt in Mexico.

354
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,540
Uh,

355
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,820
and then from there it kind of
just escalated and escalated and,

356
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,820
um,

357
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,370
started working by the other media,

358
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,451
Time magazine,

359
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:23,640
New York Times different people.

360
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:24,421
Enough to what I said,

361
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:24,970
I can't do the,

362
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,280
I can't just write new stories about this.

363
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:30,000
I've got to write books about this
because this stuff is big and it's

364
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:30,834
complicated.

365
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,400
It must be immensely complicated
for the people that live there.

366
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,140
It seems like there's no escape.

367
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,221
I mean,

368
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:38,620
if

369
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,880
you can't turn to the police,

370
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:41,470
the police are the cartel.

371
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,700
There's the cartel,

372
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:43,534
the police,

373
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,490
all the politicians,

374
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:47,140
most likely if they're alive,

375
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,520
have to be compromised.

376
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:49,690
Yeah.

377
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,230
I mean,

378
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,850
there's been some varied,

379
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,320
very desperate people and I mean,

380
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:55,480
there's been some bird has been
some inspirational people as well.

381
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:56,051
Fight in this.

382
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:56,920
There's been heroes.

383
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,173
There are heroes.

384
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,320
Um,

385
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,140
just to get more of a sense of what
that means on the ground as well.

386
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,360
Uh,

387
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,551
I,

388
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:02,860
and I,

389
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,180
and some of the things you see,

390
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,771
uh,

391
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:06,071
you know,

392
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:08,290
some of the things that stay
with me in Africa for a while,

393
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,730
it was quite romantic covering this.

394
00:11:09,731 --> 00:11:10,061
It was like,

395
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:10,301
wow,

396
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:11,134
I'm covering,

397
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,360
I'm going to these
places where chapel goes,

398
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:14,170
man is from,

399
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:14,541
you know what?

400
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,870
I've got up to the village
of me's mother meets family.

401
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,060
I'm writing about these,

402
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,170
these crazy people,

403
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,040
but then you start seeing that
the human pain in all of this.

404
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,630
Um,

405
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,560
one of many stories that stick
with me was a mother in Monta Ray,

406
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:30,400
a school teacher,

407
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,250
you know when you have
arm guys moving around,

408
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:34,060
they're also like,

409
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,570
uh,

410
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,290
really effecting the civil population,

411
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,600
had attacking the civil population.

412
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,790
And one mother,

413
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,390
um,

414
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:45,390
she was in our home with our
two children in Monterrey and a,

415
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,161
it was like in the night,

416
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:53,161
just chilling in their house and in the
door broke down and about 15 guys in

417
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:58,291
bulletproof jackets or came in long
arms just taking stuff from the house.

418
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,350
How'd the family and I pinned him
down and they said to the mother,

419
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,440
which of your children as the oldest?

420
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,300
And she was like,

421
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,230
didn't know how to apply.

422
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:08,561
I mean,

423
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,371
which of your children?

424
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:09,821
The oldest,

425
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:10,181
how do I grow?

426
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:11,170
How do I reply to that?

427
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,850
She just couldn't speak.

428
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,101
And the eldest,

429
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,430
Satya Tucson's one 18,

430
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:16,264
one 15,

431
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,590
the 18 year old was a
philosophy student and he said,

432
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,360
um,

433
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,900
I'm on the oldest.

434
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,410
So like a Yukon with
us and took them away.

435
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,920
The next day she got a phone call saying,

436
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:30,031
oh,

437
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:30,864
can we got your sign?

438
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,661
Give us this amount of money.

439
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:32,494
We'll give them back.

440
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,590
So she went round to like
relatives just got the money.

441
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,940
She wanted to get the money right away.

442
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,100
She turned up with the money,

443
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:39,731
gave some money,

444
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:42,670
and then they just cut off the calls
and she hadn't heard from him since.

445
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,610
And I,

446
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,910
I said miss seeing her face,

447
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:49,160
the devastation and the page that I,

448
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:49,270
you know,

449
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:49,840
just couldn't,

450
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,910
couldn't go on with life after
that and just not knowing,

451
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:52,900
not having the closure.

452
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,590
And I met her when I went to report
on one of the worst atrocities,

453
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,070
which was 49 borders,

454
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,550
who'd all been decapitated or had their
hands and feet cut off and all been

455
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:12,020
dumped on a road and they
would take them to the Morgan.

456
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,810
Monta Ryan arrived in the morgue.

457
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,531
I was inside.

458
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:19,300
The more to smelling the smell of the
dead bodies is kind of weird smell you get

459
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:20,530
from like decaying flesh,

460
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:23,980
kind of a sweet smell you get from when
you're around those places where you can

461
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:28,600
smell that the body is the k and I was
inside the Morgan a came out is outside

462
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:30,670
the morgue and she was trying to see if,

463
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,470
if her son might be among those people,

464
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,993
among those bodies.

465
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,553
Wow.

466
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,651
But you know,

467
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:41,484
it's,

468
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,780
it's so insane that this is right next
door to America and there's so little

469
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:48,780
effort put on doing something about it,

470
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,200
including doing something to mitigate
the influence of illegal drugs by making

471
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:56,784
drugs legal.

472
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,491
I mean,

473
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:59,580
that would be one gigantic step.

474
00:13:59,581 --> 00:13:59,760
You're,

475
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,160
you're not going to stop
people from doing drugs.

476
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:02,341
I mean,

477
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,750
this is an illogical,

478
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,310
ridiculous approach.

479
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,190
I don't think people should
do most of those drugs,

480
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,800
but when you make drugs illegal,

481
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,050
only criminals are going
to sell those drugs.

482
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,970
And this is exactly what you
have right next door to American.

483
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,830
It's just unbelievably insane
that there's this amount of crime.

484
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,950
A drive away from San Antonio.

485
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:23,500
Oh

486
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:23,951
yeah.

487
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:27,010
And talking about that issue of the
money and the economics of days.

488
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,990
So I mean,

489
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:29,890
you look at cocaine,

490
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:30,730
so you could say you've got the,

491
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,590
there was four main drugs,

492
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:33,011
now it's,

493
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:34,480
you've got fentanyl coming in as well,

494
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:34,770
and the,

495
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,190
and the cartels and making fentanyl,

496
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,780
they're making it,

497
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,500
making it yet.

498
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,450
And I made it and making
it bring in precursors,

499
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,860
making it as a lab.

500
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:42,400
One lab,

501
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,330
I was in Nogales,

502
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:44,500
uh,

503
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,560
about a year and a half ago,

504
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,440
they passed a lab in
Nogales rotten the border.

505
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,590
They'll make them have the lab they're
making the finet Fenton in and bring up

506
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,703
eh,

507
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,930
but as well as that you've got
out of the four main drugs,

508
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,450
historically a marijuana,

509
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,633
uh,

510
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,633
heroin,

511
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,990
cocaine and crystal meth.

512
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,360
And this goes back a hundred years.

513
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,670
Like so Sinhala,

514
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,230
which is the cradle of
Mexican drug trafficking.

515
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,430
It's in the low,

516
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,610
is a bit like Sicily as to the Mafia and
likes in an arrest and a Mexican drug

517
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:11,960
cartels where it began.

518
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,040
And it began right to go back to 1914 you
had in the u s to Harrison's narcotics

519
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:21,890
tax act when they made a,

520
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:25,040
they restricted opium and
cocaine in the United States.

521
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,620
And from 1915,

522
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,560
they began a cross border trade
from Mexico to the United States.

523
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,600
So that's when it started
all the way back then.

524
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:33,680
So over a hundred years ago,

525
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,380
some of the very first people doing it,

526
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:38,240
we're actually Chinese Mexicans.

527
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:40,940
They were Chinese immigrants
that arrive in Mexico.

528
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:41,870
They began doing this,

529
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:42,740
they bought opium,

530
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:43,850
um,

531
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,330
from,

532
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,610
from China planted in,

533
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,453
in Mexico.

534
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,580
And some of the first people
receiving it with Chinese Americans.

535
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,780
Some of these very early cases,

536
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:54,800
a case from 1916 investigated his
documents about this case where there was

537
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:58,400
Chinese Mexicans trafficking to
Chinese Americans here in California.

538
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,810
And at that time there
was a governor of Baja,

539
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,820
California involved.

540
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:02,841
Um,

541
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:03,674
right back then.

542
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,720
What is the solution?

543
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,430
Is there any solutions to this?

544
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,540
Well,

545
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,373
I mean,

546
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,161
I get,

547
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:10,490
you know,

548
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,630
I think a lot of people covering this,

549
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:12,530
you get very weary.

550
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,880
You want to see solutions.

551
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,353
Um,

552
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,430
you want to find solutions and you want
to come with that optimism of finding

553
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:21,890
solutions and you want to
justify why you're doing this.

554
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,030
What you're doing is for not just to tell
the stories but to look for solutions

555
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:26,864
to this.

556
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:27,770
Um,

557
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,011
and it,

558
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:28,821
it gets worried about that.

559
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,990
There's three areas.

560
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:31,370
I believe that our traditions first,

561
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:34,670
I do agree with you on the
idea of drug policy reform.

562
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,381
Again,

563
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:37,970
it is tough uphill battle.

564
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,570
I mean going back to 2012
I wrote editorials about,

565
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:41,691
you know,

566
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:45,710
one of the reasons you should legalize
marijuana is because of the marijuana

567
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:46,431
come from Mexico,

568
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:47,660
which goes to cartels,

569
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,520
which pays killers,

570
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:50,720
which pays for corruption.

571
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,300
But at the same time,

572
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,160
marijuana,

573
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:55,941
a lot of,

574
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:56,220
you know,

575
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,580
love is legalized in the United
States and the violence has,

576
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:00,110
she just got worse in Mexico.

577
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,740
So you've also got the issue of heroin,

578
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,093
uh,

579
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,090
cocaine,

580
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,131
crystal Meth,

581
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:07,964
fentanyl,

582
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,970
and you've got the cartels are
going to bunch of other rackets now.

583
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:12,270
They're still crude oil,

584
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:13,160
which is a big deal.

585
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,060
They still billions of dollars worth
of crude oil criminals down there from

586
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:20,180
pipelines can tap into
a pipeline or something.

587
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:20,421
Yeah.

588
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:21,740
You kind of pipeline you have,

589
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,240
you'd normally put in two taps.

590
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:24,680
You drill two holes in the pipeline,

591
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,620
you drill a hole to put,

592
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,581
to take the oil out,

593
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,200
you'd drill a hole to put water
in to try and keep it equal.

594
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,910
Uh,

595
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,743
the pressure,

596
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,420
the same Dev you saw as a
crazy video recently of a,

597
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:36,711
in a,

598
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:38,480
in a small town in
Mexico where a bunch of,

599
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,040
there was a tap open of really,

600
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,060
really bad tap,

601
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,530
the origins spraying out and a bunch of
people were lining up just to pick up

602
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,810
the oil from the pipeline
and exploded and just,

603
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,120
it was just like crazy death toll.

604
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:52,561
Yeah.

605
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:53,850
I did see that from,

606
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:54,091
from,

607
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:54,924
from Nada,

608
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,640
but a bad way that I do believe in,

609
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:57,121
in a,

610
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:58,170
in drug policy reform,

611
00:17:58,171 --> 00:17:58,891
we have to talk about,

612
00:17:58,891 --> 00:17:59,940
this has to be on a table.

613
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:00,691
I mean,

614
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:01,201
Americans,

615
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:01,321
there's,

616
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:01,591
you know,

617
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:03,870
no one knows really what
American spend on drugs,

618
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,820
but as the survey are where you can
find on line if you just tap and what do

619
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,470
Americans spend on illegal drugs?

620
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,040
And it is an estimate
of $100 billion a year.

621
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,170
So,

622
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:16,351
you know,

623
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:18,210
that amount of money I've been,

624
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:18,930
that's an estimate.

625
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,141
I mean,

626
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:19,860
it could be right.

627
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,011
You know,

628
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,510
it's hard to know how
it's a very round number,

629
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,820
but like $100 billion a year.

630
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,391
Now,

631
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:27,450
if you think about that pumping
into these cartels year after year,

632
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:27,690
I mean,

633
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,523
decades.

634
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,090
You know how much of that,

635
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,710
if it's 30 billion of that guide
down in Mexico in over 10 years,

636
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:36,900
300 billion over 30 years,

637
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:38,160
close to a trillion dollars,

638
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,360
that really creates this,

639
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:40,194
this monster,

640
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,970
but know a secondary.

641
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,680
So I'm not believe in drug policy reform.

642
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:43,861
I mean,

643
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:44,694
I don't know how,

644
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,630
I mean Rehab,

645
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,690
they want to needs it because
heroin addicts by lot of heroin.

646
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,230
So every one you save from that you can,

647
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:52,681
uh,

648
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:52,921
you know,

649
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:55,350
you can stop a lot of heroin
and a lot of that money.

650
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,810
What does money goes to these
people who are doing this stuff.

651
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,680
But a second area I
believe is his social work.

652
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,070
Uh,

653
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,000
in the neighborhoods.

654
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,200
Uh,

655
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,011
like I've talked to,

656
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:08,160
I've done a lot of interviews with
particularly with the assassins,

657
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,220
with the killers in cartels in
Mexico and also around Latin America.

658
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:15,360
I've been traveling around Jamaica,

659
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:16,981
Brazil,

660
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:17,850
Central America,

661
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,570
Colombia,

662
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,220
talking to a lot of
the killers especially.

663
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,460
And when I sit down with them,

664
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,880
I try and get their life story.

665
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:27,570
Like how did they first get into this
because you're not born doing this stuff.

666
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,880
And often,

667
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,301
I mean,

668
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:32,430
in some cases that is
the different profiles.

669
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,353
There's some of them,

670
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,490
uh,

671
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,323
in noticed one,

672
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,170
one guy,

673
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,430
this is done in Honduras,

674
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,140
which is also crazy situation,

675
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,181
was a guy there.

676
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,110
I actually met him before I'd met him
when I was doing some reporting down there

677
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:47,190
back in 2015.

678
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:52,670
And he was driving for us and he was
also carrying a gun to help protect us as

679
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:55,410
with the journeys to that I had had,

680
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,830
had been hit before.

681
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:58,170
We've been actually shot before.

682
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,001
And,

683
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:00,834
uh,

684
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,450
then I met him again afterwards
and gone to tell his story,

685
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,730
which is kind of typical
of a lot of these guys.

686
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,900
And he described how he been abandoned
as a kid by his parents and had this real

687
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,400
hate that he had with the world.

688
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,091
Like,

689
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:22,110
and I just fucked a world.

690
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,490
Um,

691
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:28,380
and he described the first time
that he carried out murders.

692
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,370
Um,

693
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:29,730
and it,

694
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,271
this is us though.

695
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,170
I'm an he carried out.

696
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,420
They already doc,

697
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,140
he documented all these hits he'd done
and to capitations he'd done in his kind

698
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:37,974
of crazy stuff.

699
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,010
But the first time a cat it,

700
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:40,970
a murder was probably the,

701
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:41,181
the,

702
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:45,520
the freakiest when he was
I think 14 and they got a,

703
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,470
a family,

704
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,550
they went into a house,

705
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,151
I couldn't a lot.

706
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:51,070
They've got family and
they butchered a family.

707
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,350
And he described when he described
that and then described later on,

708
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:56,710
you know,

709
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,540
how he became a higher killer.

710
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,180
And the thing about him,

711
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:03,010
like some of these people you
think they're psychopaths,

712
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,361
they just,

713
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,080
they really don't care.

714
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,160
But some of them really do have
these conflicts inside the heart.

715
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:13,180
I think he was someone or a list of
back to that interview and he had,

716
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,500
and it's hard to,

717
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:19,210
to balance that someone who does evil
but also has it been a victim as well,

718
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,440
a victim and the victimizer.

719
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,600
And you feel that pain since,

720
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:24,490
since then he himself been been murdered.

721
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,373
Um,

722
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:26,740
but uh,

723
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:26,951
yeah,

724
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:27,360
he's uh,

725
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,571
who's,

726
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:28,161
you know one,

727
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:32,650
so how you get social work to reach
people from a very young age because often

728
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:34,840
they are recruited into
organized crime when they're 12,

729
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,760
13 years old.

730
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,260
So he butchered his family when was 14
when it was his stealing money from them.

731
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,610
So the story would,

732
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:43,190
that was,

733
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,220
he said that he was hanging around with
these basically street kids and one of

734
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:48,054
the other kids said,

735
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,930
I know where there's
some money in a house,

736
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,300
we can get some money in a house.

737
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:58,050
So they went in there and
killed his family and it
turned out there was no money

738
00:21:59,381 --> 00:21:59,710
there.

739
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,250
And the reason the other kid had said
go there was because he'd actually been

740
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:06,550
living with his family and he
said they'd been abusive to him.

741
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,180
So he wanted to like Rivett
have revenge on his family.

742
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,860
Well what was so really sick of that is
to when he was describing it was they

743
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:19,861
had this family and they would to
stop them defending themselves.

744
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,690
They would like take them one by one,

745
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:23,411
like pin him in a,

746
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:24,790
in a room and take them one by one.

747
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,480
I'd take them out,

748
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,560
butchered them how the other ones
didn't really know what was going on and

749
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:29,921
think,

750
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:31,480
I mean the action itself,

751
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:34,120
but how like teenage kids
can think about that stuff.

752
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,820
And then later on when he
was talking about the uh,

753
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:43,180
decapitations he was talking about they
get contracts with the capitation inside

754
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:43,901
the quite like they say,

755
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:44,470
look,

756
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,430
we want this killing.

757
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:46,780
We wanted to to capitate a guy,

758
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,340
we want this doc,

759
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,520
we want to see video of
the guy being the cap tech.

760
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,880
We want that.

761
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,720
We want the guy to suffer.

762
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,930
And when he hacks the heads off,

763
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,560
dare sometimes still be a moment when
like when the life goes out of them and

764
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,770
when the body is still luck.

765
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,633
Twitching.

766
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,180
Lucky says they can still see like
was there's a bit like nerves.

767
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:09,014
It was like a chicken,

768
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,100
like a headless chicken.

769
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,220
There's a bit as a part when
he's still like twitching a bit,

770
00:23:13,221 --> 00:23:15,410
even after day or you know,

771
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,360
they've lost a kind of seven there,

772
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:18,194
connections there.

773
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,263
Ooh.

774
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,400
Now when you're interviewing these people,

775
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,230
how nervous are you?

776
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,230
I mean this seems like if you're
putting all this stuff down,

777
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,970
you could implicate them in some crimes
and it seems like it would be very

778
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:35,800
convenient for them to
try to get rid of you.

779
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,060
So is,

780
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,600
there's a whole bunch of different
situations around interview.

781
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,181
So some labs,

782
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:41,410
I've interviewed people in prisons,

783
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,490
a lot of time in prisons.

784
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:43,770
Um,

785
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:43,960
you know,

786
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,980
this took me years to,

787
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,070
to get to a lot of these people.

788
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,940
First of all,

789
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,420
you know,

790
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,290
W it wasn't like,

791
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,124
uh,

792
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:49,581
um,

793
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:51,170
when I first started
doing this I was like,

794
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,390
you know,

795
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:51,921
how do I get,

796
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:55,130
how do I reach them and start going
around to drug rehab places and talking to

797
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:56,120
people in Drug Rehab?

798
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,250
I'm going into prisons and NCLR wireless.

799
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,080
I did a lot of interviews in and in one
prison I got to know a lot of prisoners

800
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,660
and the prisoners [inaudible] in a
Christian evangelical wing there and they

801
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:10,580
were going through this
weird Christian in.

802
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:15,581
I like Christina in a discovery of God
there and then through the street on the

803
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:16,311
street,

804
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:17,690
often light through content.

805
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:19,760
I mean we're old time through
contacts on the street.

806
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,300
Um,

807
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,190
and in Honduras,

808
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:25,340
a lot of great contacts with a friend
is a journalist who grew up in his

809
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:25,701
neighbors.

810
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:25,821
We'd,

811
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:26,570
all of these guys,

812
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,051
he just knows,

813
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:30,110
knows that his guys from growing up now.

814
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,430
Yeah,

815
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,270
there's different,

816
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,200
different things,

817
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:34,640
you know that have been bad situations.

818
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,120
I think anybody covering this
has had some bad situations.

819
00:24:37,121 --> 00:24:39,110
Sometime people get angry,

820
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,460
people threatened them and so forth.

821
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,430
But a lot of the time when it's,

822
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,880
when you talk to people,

823
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,540
yeah.

824
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,520
And one thing that you
have to be very low Tom,

825
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,990
you have to be very stringent about
protecting the identity and really serious

826
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:56,700
about that because there's been cases
where various cases where other people

827
00:24:56,701 --> 00:25:01,701
have interviewed killers and shown their
identity either through the [inaudible]

828
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:08,970
face or through like some dumb thing
being showed and they have been themselves

829
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:14,790
murdered in a butchered after these x
given these interviews or like other

830
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:15,541
things are happened,

831
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:18,120
they'd been threatened or something
to family or arrested or Sifo.

832
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,030
So you really got to
protect people's identities.

833
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:22,883
Okay.

834
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:28,070
In a way in terms of when they talk and
stuff and I didn't really feel nervous

835
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,270
when I need one of these people,

836
00:25:30,271 --> 00:25:32,460
I probably feel more
nervous hit or come to you.

837
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,100
That's just 40 kids.

838
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:36,510
It's like all the other on a big show.

839
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,381
It's a different,

840
00:25:37,381 --> 00:25:40,200
a different thing when
you're like talking to

841
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,121
first,

842
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:42,301
you know,

843
00:25:42,301 --> 00:25:43,470
you start with easy questions,

844
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:43,951
like anything,

845
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:47,940
you start talking about how in
a how you know people are human,

846
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,480
they're human beings
and people have got it.

847
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,250
People are complicated and I haven't
just interviewed and I've also got drunk

848
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,120
with somebody people and
hung around with somebody.

849
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,003
People.

850
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,490
Um,

851
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,780
for times trying to get closer,

852
00:25:57,781 --> 00:25:58,140
like,

853
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,920
uh,

854
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,101
you know,

855
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:01,950
spent time to try and understand
their world a bit more.

856
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,840
What's the most time you've
ever spent with these people?

857
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,270
Um,

858
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,390
in several days.

859
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:07,921
Several days.

860
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:08,340
Yeah.

861
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,430
Like a in I like I'm a
now CEDAM see him again,

862
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,870
hung out with in a hangout with them.

863
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,940
I in different places,

864
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:15,721
not all the time,

865
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:16,411
sometimes just,

866
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:16,621
you know,

867
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:18,300
sit down and do interviews and just leave.

868
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,193
Uh,

869
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:21,511
but it's,

870
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:21,661
it's,

871
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:25,240
it's a complicated world for them is
it's their normality knows if for them is

872
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:25,940
normal.

873
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,350
Uh,

874
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:26,650
it's,

875
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:27,580
it's what they've,

876
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,561
what they've lived,

877
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:30,490
what they've been through,

878
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,140
what's happening around them.

879
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:32,930
Um,

880
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,940
and this level of murder,

881
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:36,340
this happened a lot of parts of
Latin American now it's crazy.

882
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:37,930
But in these areas is in his,

883
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:38,051
what?

884
00:26:38,051 --> 00:26:40,660
He talked to other people who
had just on the edge of this,

885
00:26:40,661 --> 00:26:44,070
we'll have family members involved in
this and it's just they're living this,

886
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:44,251
I mean,

887
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:47,280
these are levels of violence and it's
interesting to compare historically these

888
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:48,120
levels of violence.

889
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,663
Um,

890
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,110
because you look at some of the
worst cities like San Pedro,

891
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,740
Sula on Doris Caracas
harm Sierra wireless,

892
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:01,670
and these are places which
have levels of violence,

893
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:04,800
which are like way worst
in medieval Europe,

894
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,720
a lot based in medieval Europe.

895
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,020
I mean,

896
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,930
look at the figures per hundred thousand
because some of them have over a

897
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:12,930
hundred,

898
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,110
a hundred thousand,

899
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,640
150,

900
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,310
100,000 and medieval Europe a lot.

901
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,230
These cities were like
20 per hundred thousand.

902
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,643
So they're way worse,

903
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,870
way worse in the wild west than like
now there are some place in the United

904
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:23,871
States,

905
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:24,440
the de la.

906
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:24,551
Oh.

907
00:27:24,551 --> 00:27:28,440
And I did and I've done some research
recently in Baltimore Marin hand and I was

908
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:28,670
kind of,

909
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:33,420
it's interesting to compare that to
Latin America and that's a high level.

910
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:36,750
That's 40 by a hundred thousands
that's not as the same level,

911
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:39,600
but it's significant still
more than medieval Europe.

912
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,440
Yeah.

913
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,000
Wow.

914
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,870
Baltimore is worse than Medieval Europe.

915
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,210
Yeah.

916
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:43,691
I'm going to ask.

917
00:27:43,691 --> 00:27:43,951
That gets,

918
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:47,340
you have to have to do some professors
then they weren't in a like you get like,

919
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,001
you know they might be,

920
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:48,421
they might say,

921
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:51,450
well Jerusalem in this
time or in a line I like,

922
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:54,570
you've got to try and it's hard to note
that it really dig down exact club net.

923
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:57,590
There was outbreaks of violence
and killing in certain places,

924
00:27:57,591 --> 00:28:00,000
but the overall average
of all average year,

925
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,320
that's a significant leap.

926
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,980
100% leap ea.

927
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,120
Absolutely.

928
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,680
Baltimore.

929
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,090
What about South side of Chicago?

930
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,830
It's not that,

931
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,830
I mean like the level I think in Chicago
comes out around 20 or something,

932
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:16,950
so it's not now the Emerg
that of the whole city.

933
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,850
Now these again,

934
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:21,300
and one of the things about the violence
in the United States compared to Latin

935
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:23,720
America in Baltimore is,

936
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:23,981
is,

937
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:24,200
is,

938
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,590
is significant bit of fairly what the
city of Baltimore is a fairly small place

939
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,120
where they're talking about.

940
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,570
So in Mexico you have entire states
that are like really violent or entire

941
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:35,400
countries in Latin America,

942
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,460
whereas in the u s it tends to be
neighborhoods which are violent.

943
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:39,661
Um,

944
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:42,290
so if you really focus on
the south side of Chicago,

945
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,430
it's probably similar levels to Baltimore.

946
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:44,851
Then,

947
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:45,071
you know,

948
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:45,904
it's a,

949
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,700
but if you look at the whole city,

950
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:49,800
you've got neighbors did a
pretty safe in Chicago as well.

951
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,263
Now,

952
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,510
through all of this time that
you spent down in Mexico,

953
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,010
have you seen it?

954
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,210
You've seen it escalate,

955
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,710
you've seen it get worse and worse.

956
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,451
Yeah.

957
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:04,451
So there was first this really big
escalation happening in 2008 was the first

958
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:07,020
big escalation where
it was a cause of that.

959
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,490
So you had,

960
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,580
there was a steady build
up there was happening.

961
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:12,840
Um,

962
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,730
and then in 2006,

963
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:20,450
do you had the president fully pickar
that on Claire to military crack down on

964
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,713
drug cartels.

965
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,160
And after that with those as big response
and things started really getting out

966
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:26,994
of hand,

967
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,050
we'd already seen violence
escalating before.

968
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,520
And in my idea,

969
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,980
my kind of theory behind this is that,

970
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,360
um,

971
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,700
you had in Mexico back
in the 20th century,

972
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:40,590
more of a top down,

973
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,033
um,

974
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,620
centralized government
controlling everything you had,

975
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:49,060
the Pri and power and they were basically,

976
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:50,530
they will have to coordinate
through corruption.

977
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,330
So back then they'd have the drug cartels
working for them and an interesting

978
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:56,041
story guy.

979
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:56,720
And back then,

980
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,880
the 19 day nine 70 store in a book
called drug lord by Terence Popper who

981
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:01,211
interviewed,

982
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:01,890
uh,

983
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,230
a drug trafficker in the
eighties when he got the,

984
00:30:05,231 --> 00:30:06,880
his job is to ha have hit a plateau,

985
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:08,410
which is the head of a certain territory.

986
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,510
When he got the job,

987
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,950
he went with the state
police at the time and said,

988
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:16,930
I want to become the head of the plaza.

989
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,860
And they took him in and
tortured him for two days unlike,

990
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,630
and I beat the crap out of him,

991
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,120
put electric shocks on his nuts.

992
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,250
One of the big taught at Dmexco put
water laced with Chile in his nose.

993
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,150
Smell like one of these big,

994
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:32,230
so your whole face burns.

995
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,090
He's a like torture techniques they have.

996
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,760
And after two days of
torture him and said,

997
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:37,000
yeah,

998
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,800
well done,

999
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:37,990
you know,

1000
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,870
you survived.

1001
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,880
Well you've got the job.

1002
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,960
So we know what it shows is that
the police had the upper hand,

1003
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:46,991
the police control this.

1004
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:47,410
They were like,

1005
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:47,681
okay,

1006
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,210
we control this racket and you know,

1007
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:51,340
we can fuck around and
tortured and killed.

1008
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:52,450
Rock rock was when we like,

1009
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:54,851
uh,

1010
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:55,091
you know,

1011
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:56,380
in all up the presidency.

1012
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:56,711
I mean,

1013
00:30:56,711 --> 00:30:57,610
there was a,

1014
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,200
in that time,

1015
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,360
Carlos Salinas became
president in [inaudible] 94,

1016
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,190
his brother Raul Salinas,

1017
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,460
there,

1018
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,670
there's the Swiss investigators,

1019
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,290
bank accounts and said he had
$500 million in bank accounts.

1020
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:09,750
We say,

1021
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,000
you know,

1022
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,090
they,

1023
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,230
they believed it was drug money.

1024
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,880
So right up to the presidency,

1025
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:13,960
this was was being run.

1026
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,310
Ooh,

1027
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,900
when makes a code change democracy.

1028
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:19,240
So when I arrived in Mexico was
changing to democracy and it's like,

1029
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:19,601
wow,

1030
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:21,130
great democracy is going to happen.

1031
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,170
Free markets going to happen.

1032
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:23,711
You know,

1033
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:27,370
we're in a good days
at a 21st century now.

1034
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,510
But what happened was you'd look
to political control shifted.

1035
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:35,860
So you had a bunch of different political
parties and they were fighting over

1036
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:36,694
the drug trade.

1037
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,901
And you know,

1038
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:41,680
I was one time in regular echo when the
federal police had a shootout with the

1039
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:42,514
municipal police.

1040
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,880
They were fighting each other probably
because they work for different drug

1041
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:46,714
cartels.

1042
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,470
Wow.

1043
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,550
So that's what started.

1044
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,320
But then you had the techniques,

1045
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:51,640
like the technique of beheading

1046
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,730
wasn't really a big deal.

1047
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:55,901
It was very,

1048
00:31:55,901 --> 00:32:00,901
very rarely used up until around 2006
and one of the first incidents was in

1049
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:05,890
acapulco in 2006 in about June,

1050
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,890
2006 now it might have been after
inspired by the al Qaeda car,

1051
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,760
we in a video which was
shown him full of Mexican TV.

1052
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,841
I remember when that came out,

1053
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:18,370
when they'd decapitated the guy in Iraq

1054
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,930
and they decapitate first
it was two policemen,

1055
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:22,764
Eddie capitate.

1056
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,800
Later that year in September,

1057
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,840
2006 there was five heads,

1058
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:30,460
they rolled onto a disco dance floor.

1059
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,980
And then his thing just became,

1060
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,250
just escalating,

1061
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,880
just became this kind of light
using his terror public terror.

1062
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,920
So 2006,

1063
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:44,110
2008 was a big escalation and
then 2011 12 were like crazy.

1064
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,480
And then it subsided a bit in a pub.

1065
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:50,840
The violence got bit less public
and it was more like hidden,

1066
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:52,010
like mass grave stuff.

1067
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,320
Now the worst mass grave
has been discovered so far,

1068
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,240
um,

1069
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,290
was in Veracruz.

1070
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:02,460
I've been to the side of it and it was
250 bodies were found in this mass grave

1071
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,860
in one place and it was right
next to a housing estate.

1072
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,550
And there's families who was,

1073
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:14,300
so one of the saddest things was you sick.

1074
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:19,220
You see their kid is bicycles
and basketball hoops and
stuff right next to this

1075
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,960
and the field next to that,

1076
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:25,961
they'd dub up 250 bodies and the smell
was like emanating to this housing

1077
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:28,124
estate.

1078
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,510
And he's looking at a Middle Clark,

1079
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:30,980
the dream of becoming middle class.

1080
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:31,814
That was the,

1081
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,160
the kind of in this housing
state and right next to it,

1082
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:35,330
this violence.

1083
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:39,700
But when I say a lot of these stories
and having been the crazy stories,

1084
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,340
but a lot of the weird thing is a lot
of Mexico lives in normality around this

1085
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,390
is not what you,

1086
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,470
this is not what you see every day.

1087
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:46,640
This is why this happens.

1088
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,280
But there's also just a normality
that could just be like,

1089
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:50,600
you're outside here in la.

1090
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:54,050
And normal people living normal
lives around this as well.

1091
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,160
What is the response in Mexico?

1092
00:33:57,161 --> 00:34:02,161
Like what would it mean after they wanted
to have this military action against

1093
00:34:03,101 --> 00:34:03,940
the cartels?

1094
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,550
Obviously that hasn't
really put a dent in it.

1095
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,470
What,

1096
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:07,840
what,

1097
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,550
what's the,

1098
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,110
the current thought process
behind dealing with this?

1099
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,770
So there's been a,

1100
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,490
there's a bunch of like citizen,

1101
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,473
um,

1102
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,700
protest movement various times,

1103
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:18,870
um,

1104
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,950
during these recent years.

1105
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:20,490
And wire them was,

1106
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,930
it was a very interesting
gargled hobbyist,

1107
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:25,350
Cecilia who is a poet and a
writer whose son was murdered.

1108
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,000
And He,

1109
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,900
when it first happened,

1110
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,520
his son was murdered and he just came out,

1111
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:31,410
sis the press where he's like an icon.

1112
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:32,431
There's just like,

1113
00:34:32,431 --> 00:34:32,940
this is just,

1114
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,170
you know,

1115
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:33,780
Mexico's gone,

1116
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,081
I can't,

1117
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:34,561
I can't deal with,

1118
00:34:34,561 --> 00:34:35,490
is my son's being killed.

1119
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:39,780
And then he began talking in very now and
then he went to the streets and people

1120
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:41,040
coming out publicly,

1121
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,450
um,

1122
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,283
crying.

1123
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,870
And it was one of the first
times there's a realization,

1124
00:34:45,871 --> 00:34:48,900
a lot of innocent people dying
with this and people come out.

1125
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:49,170
And,

1126
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:49,370
you know,

1127
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,280
I went to some of these things.

1128
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:51,870
People come out crying,

1129
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,160
family members and she
actually a sense we,

1130
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,380
we're victims here because there's a,

1131
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,410
for a long time since it's
simply bad guys killing bad guys.

1132
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,090
And that wasn't the case.

1133
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,021
Now,

1134
00:35:01,021 --> 00:35:02,220
the current president,

1135
00:35:02,221 --> 00:35:06,300
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who just won
the election last year and he just took

1136
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:07,560
power on December the first,

1137
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,110
so he's got to mix things.

1138
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:12,660
So one of them is this
idea of the war's over.

1139
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,580
I'm going to create peace,

1140
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,560
we can have forgiveness,

1141
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,610
reconciliation and up is hard
to know what that really means.

1142
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,460
And his second thing is we need to have,

1143
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:24,680
um,

1144
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,450
more of a unified state police.

1145
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:32,160
So like what I described before about
you had local police fighting the federal

1146
00:35:32,161 --> 00:35:32,700
police.

1147
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,301
So we've got to have,

1148
00:35:33,301 --> 00:35:34,290
so he's got this idea now,

1149
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,310
the national guard,

1150
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,780
which is a kind of hybrid between
military and police thing around,

1151
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:41,970
and that's basically his,

1152
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,510
his,

1153
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,400
these kind of two thrusts he's in now.

1154
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,470
He's only been in power
for a couple of months.

1155
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,830
January was still a bad
month in terms of murders,

1156
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,850
in terms of bodies.

1157
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,390
Last year was more than
33,000 dead last year,

1158
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,310
which is the size of Mexico,

1159
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,640
the equivalent of the United
States having close to 100,000.

1160
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,610
Now imagine what that would
mean in the United States.

1161
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:05,010
If you had that many
people dying in a year,

1162
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,423
a month,

1163
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,030
the whole year in a year,

1164
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,780
100,000.

1165
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,613
Yeah.

1166
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,150
Now,

1167
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,100
when these people are,

1168
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,360
when they're being
recruited by the cartels,

1169
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:18,010
when the police officers
are being recruited,

1170
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,010
the big issue must be will
they must be two issues,

1171
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:21,221
right?

1172
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,054
Safety.

1173
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,770
Like if they don't join the cartel,

1174
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,060
they probably get murdered.

1175
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,110
And two,

1176
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:29,560
the amount of money the cartel would
give them would be far more than the

1177
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:32,380
government would give them to
be a legitimate police officer.

1178
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,181
Yeah,

1179
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:33,441
sure.

1180
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:33,671
And that,

1181
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:35,160
that's like a no.

1182
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:36,840
Famously platinum blonde plateau,

1183
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,291
plateau,

1184
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:37,620
Poloma,

1185
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:37,811
luck,

1186
00:36:37,811 --> 00:36:38,640
silver or led.

1187
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,010
You want to have the silver of the bribe,

1188
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,240
the lead of the bullet.

1189
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,261
But,

1190
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:44,780
but even beyond that for a long time,

1191
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,250
a lot of these people
who joined the police,

1192
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:47,780
uh,

1193
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,750
like from the beginning,

1194
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:49,060
they're in.

1195
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,690
I,

1196
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,090
I've taught,

1197
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:50,341
I've got,

1198
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,091
I've got on video,

1199
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:51,660
uh,

1200
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,730
met a video back in 2010 in
Sierra wireless of a bunch of,

1201
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,010
uh,

1202
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,380
of rappers just hang around
in the middle of all this.

1203
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,200
And one of their friends were saying,

1204
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,940
and they were talking and
these people were saying,

1205
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:03,091
you know,

1206
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:04,380
some of them been done for taking drugs,

1207
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:06,090
have the board and they'd
been in gangs and stuff.

1208
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:07,830
And one was like,

1209
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,663
I want to be a policeman.

1210
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,830
And he was like,

1211
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:12,210
I want to be a policeman
and make some money,

1212
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:12,961
you know,

1213
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:14,790
basically through
corruptions that as I said,

1214
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:17,140
it is like that is the
mentality of somebody.

1215
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,900
People joining the police from early on.

1216
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:19,940
Another guy,

1217
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,640
Guy Open,

1218
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,470
open a first book with his guy,

1219
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:23,250
uh,

1220
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:23,580
who,

1221
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,960
who became policemen.

1222
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:25,860
Um,

1223
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,693
when he was 18,

1224
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,350
he was basically a hard,

1225
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,273
tough guy.

1226
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,740
Pet American football from Durango,

1227
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:36,720
became a policeman when he was 18 and
into police learn to torture and learned a

1228
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:37,290
murder.

1229
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:37,601
He said,

1230
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:38,940
that's what I learned in a place.

1231
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,220
And it just at 20 after two years,

1232
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:43,250
just left the place and
went full time into crime.

1233
00:37:43,251 --> 00:37:44,084
And he's like,

1234
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,630
so you know,

1235
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:48,260
you've got a situation where you know,

1236
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:48,840
it's not,

1237
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,700
it's,

1238
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,640
it's worse even as beyond
that they're the bad,

1239
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:54,810
a lockable might imagine of corruption.

1240
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,560
God.

1241
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,000
So

1242
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
all of this essentially is escalated
from the time you came to Mexico.

1243
00:38:01,101 --> 00:38:02,030
So when you came back to,

1244
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,070
it sounds like you got in,

1245
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:04,281
I mean,

1246
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:08,030
if it was a story you got in
at almost the perfect time.

1247
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,840
Yeah,

1248
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,240
yeah,

1249
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,610
yeah.

1250
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,630
Horrible way.

1251
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:10,831
Yeah,

1252
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:10,990
yeah,

1253
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:11,281
yeah,

1254
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:11,560
yeah.

1255
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:11,770
I mean,

1256
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,603
it's,

1257
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,091
I mean,

1258
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:13,924
like,

1259
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:14,171
you know,

1260
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:14,391
you don't,

1261
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:15,940
you don't do these things on purpose,

1262
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,361
uh,

1263
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:16,571
you know,

1264
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:17,440
you don't think,

1265
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,900
and if I look back 20 years ago,

1266
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:20,111
I mean,

1267
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:21,670
it's 18 years I've been in Mexico now,

1268
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,540
I had grown up in Mexico and that,

1269
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,383
in that sense,

1270
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:25,950
I,

1271
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,771
I've never looked back.

1272
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:31,771
And I think that's it now in
terms of myself seeing this.

1273
00:38:32,141 --> 00:38:32,351
I mean,

1274
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:32,620
it's,

1275
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,011
I mean,

1276
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,480
I think for anybody it's paced,

1277
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,280
painful.

1278
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,771
I mean,

1279
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:39,520
how you process that level of depth,

1280
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:40,440
that level of murder,

1281
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,350
level of suffering.

1282
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:42,760
Uh,

1283
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,031
it's,

1284
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:43,391
it's,

1285
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:44,224
uh,

1286
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:45,600
it's,

1287
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:45,791
it's,

1288
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,000
it's horrible stuff to see and,

1289
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:47,221
and,

1290
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:48,054
and it's,

1291
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,800
you could still have a lot of people,

1292
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,693
um,

1293
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,730
separated from that in our families.

1294
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:57,790
People bring up children and,

1295
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:58,841
you know,

1296
00:38:58,841 --> 00:38:59,710
you want to separate,

1297
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:00,790
you know,

1298
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,990
kids from that.

1299
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,221
So off often,

1300
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:05,200
like middle class kids in Mexico,

1301
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:09,790
quite sheltered because families want to
shelter them as much as they can from,

1302
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:10,060
from,

1303
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,170
from that violence and just,

1304
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:11,380
you know,

1305
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,480
not let them see that side of things.

1306
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,240
How much of that do you have
to deal with in Mexico City?

1307
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,890
So Mexico City,

1308
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:18,770
you know,

1309
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:23,770
is about the same murder rate as Houston
to Mexico City is not supervised now.

1310
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:25,690
It's still not super safe,

1311
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,680
but it's not super Vinad.

1312
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,520
So Mexico City is kind of,

1313
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,890
and there are parts of Mexico,

1314
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:37,891
which of which are fairly safe now the
state of Yucatan were meritorious is the

1315
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:40,480
same murder level as Belgium.

1316
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,460
So you've got oasis within Mexico where
you don't have this level of violence.

1317
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,180
So Mexico City is it and is a great city.

1318
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,510
Mexico City is a great city to live in
in many ways apart from the traffic and

1319
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:55,120
the pollution and various things.

1320
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,371
I mean,

1321
00:39:55,371 --> 00:39:56,500
there's a bunch of things that are,

1322
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,361
and I know,

1323
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,080
and I love all of Mexico
and I love all of,

1324
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,311
you know,

1325
00:39:59,311 --> 00:39:59,891
Latin America.

1326
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:00,360
I love even,

1327
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,990
and even the bad places I still love.

1328
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,550
I enjoy going to these places.

1329
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:07,150
I enjoy meeting people there in a hangout,

1330
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:08,140
in his areas.

1331
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,640
There's a lot of good
things about him still.

1332
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:14,850
But dealing with all the horrific
tragedies that you report about and

1333
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,263
experience,

1334
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,190
do you look for an escape route?

1335
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,480
I mean,

1336
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,060
are you,

1337
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,250
are you looking to get
the fuck out of dodge?

1338
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:22,661
Yeah.

1339
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:22,870
How,

1340
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,171
I mean,

1341
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,004
um,

1342
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,860
there's been different times where,

1343
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:27,160
uh,

1344
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:27,993
I,

1345
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,171
I've thought,

1346
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:29,291
you know,

1347
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:29,580
I wanted,

1348
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,430
I want to stop this now.

1349
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:31,450
Uncover other things.

1350
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,020
Yeah.

1351
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,890
As a journalist.

1352
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,470
And he's the other journalists doing
that as well as the journey is called

1353
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:35,651
heads.

1354
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:35,951
Who says,

1355
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:38,200
give Eric Great Mexican
journalist who's just,

1356
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:39,280
I just saw him at the,

1357
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:39,850
uh,

1358
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:40,780
tried of El Chapo,

1359
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:41,451
uh,

1360
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:44,650
over in New York and who's
been covering this for years.

1361
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:44,960
One of the,

1362
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,190
you know,

1363
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,450
really great Mexican,

1364
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:47,350
uh,

1365
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,340
correspondence is covered,

1366
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:48,881
the drug stuff.

1367
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:49,660
And he was like,

1368
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,493
he just said to me,

1369
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,191
our butter,

1370
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:52,540
I've got some stuff maybe I can give you.

1371
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:53,930
This is the harm.

1372
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:54,890
I'm [inaudible] this.

1373
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,451
And the last thing,

1374
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:55,871
I'm going to do,

1375
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,510
Catherine trucks now and I,

1376
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,190
we love,

1377
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:58,900
we know we'll sit.

1378
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,040
We'll see if that's true.

1379
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,390
Um,

1380
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,100
I think a lot of the time you get,

1381
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:03,331
you know,

1382
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:05,110
you get caught still doing this stuff.

1383
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,751
You a piston when you,

1384
00:41:05,751 --> 00:41:06,730
when you've covered something,

1385
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:07,600
people will want more,

1386
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:08,940
people are interested as a,

1387
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,840
and there's relevance to this.

1388
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:11,770
Um,

1389
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:16,090
I think some of the other
struggles beyond like the,

1390
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,310
the danger in staff is simply,

1391
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:20,200
I mean we'd journalism's in a bad way.

1392
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,300
I love the media in a bad way.

1393
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,703
Um,

1394
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
and just simply getting know,

1395
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,260
trying to be know I'm a free lance,

1396
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,491
generous,

1397
00:41:26,491 --> 00:41:28,720
I love being a free last year and
they started loving independence.

1398
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,200
I love being a write books and crackle
and write magazine stories and make

1399
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:34,550
documentaries and do these things.

1400
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,490
But like just in having
the economic base for that,

1401
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:37,951
you know,

1402
00:41:37,951 --> 00:41:40,610
see she's degenerate and lots in
the time that I've been doing it.

1403
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,160
Have you personally been targeted at all?

1404
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,510
So there's a couple of situations or had,

1405
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,290
um,

1406
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:48,710
and I,

1407
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:48,921
I mean,

1408
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:49,401
first I,

1409
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:52,010
when I know I'm going to have to give some

1410
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,330
calm respect and,

1411
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:56,840
uh,

1412
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,880
condolences to so many colleagues,

1413
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,130
Mexican colleagues who have
been murdered and been,

1414
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,660
had been murdered,

1415
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:03,410
threatened,

1416
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,560
had to leave the country and various
things and they've had it bad.

1417
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:07,940
Um,

1418
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,570
including,

1419
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:08,900
uh,

1420
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,591
a friend,

1421
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:10,171
a good friend,

1422
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:15,171
a great colleague called Heavier
Bell Desk who was shot dead in 2017,

1423
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:17,660
May,

1424
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,750
2017 in cooler can a guy
I'd known since 2008,

1425
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:21,590
um,

1426
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,423
great guy,

1427
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,210
got drunk with him in the Cantina,

1428
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,260
very generous guy.

1429
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,350
He wrote eight books,

1430
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,420
a charismatic,

1431
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:29,991
I mean,

1432
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:30,231
you know,

1433
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:33,950
really lovely guy who was shot
dead and many other stories.

1434
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:34,491
So,

1435
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:39,040
so I kind of don't want to give my own
compare Martin waste a lot of them in

1436
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:39,501
many ways.

1437
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:39,861
But yeah,

1438
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:40,101
sure.

1439
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:40,721
There's been times,

1440
00:42:40,721 --> 00:42:41,760
there's one time in a,

1441
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,280
it was in the state called Mitchell
Afghan and this was 2014 and there was a

1442
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:53,840
thing that happened there when a lot of
regular people rose up with guns against

1443
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:54,674
the cartels.

1444
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,750
They will known as outer defense as or
like self defense courts and they rose up

1445
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:04,210
to fight the cartels and uh,

1446
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:04,661
they,

1447
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:05,150
they,

1448
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:05,301
you know,

1449
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:06,320
a bunch of guys with guns.

1450
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:08,420
It was kind of crazy situation
where there was his luck,

1451
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:12,230
almost like a trench warfare
happen between cartels and
his self defense groups.

1452
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,720
And then what happened was a lot of
regular gangsters started saying,

1453
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:17,811
well,

1454
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:19,130
we're self defense groups as well,

1455
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:19,660
you know,

1456
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,360
just coming up saying,

1457
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:20,560
oh yeah,

1458
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,381
we're self-defence equips,

1459
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:21,531
you know,

1460
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:22,970
those guys are out in
the street with guns,

1461
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:23,131
you know,

1462
00:43:23,131 --> 00:43:24,230
we're just going to go out with our guns.

1463
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,090
And so anyway,

1464
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,141
I went down,

1465
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:29,930
I drove down at the end of this have
been that I've been covering this right

1466
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:33,830
through and it had been fairly
okay to do the self defense squads.

1467
00:43:33,831 --> 00:43:36,500
The outer defenses were pretty
easy going to work with,

1468
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,040
but I drove down there to,

1469
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:39,970
to Mitchell can,

1470
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,450
um,

1471
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,500
and I wanted to do some stuff on it and
I was going to meet a friend and our

1472
00:43:44,501 --> 00:43:44,870
journey,

1473
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:46,460
she just backed out at the last minute.

1474
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:50,810
I just went down there anyway and
arrived there and there was about 50 guys

1475
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:53,240
arrived in this place near
the city called a passing Gan.

1476
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,990
And there's about 50 guys who supposedly
as defense squad in a parking lot

1477
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,860
getting ready to go on a mission to
try and take down this drug trafficker

1478
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,430
called lap Dota.

1479
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:09,403
And they were like,

1480
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:10,603
they were sitting there.

1481
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,040
It was a guy who like signing
them up for this kind of mission.

1482
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,330
And there's a bunch of guys they were,

1483
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,720
and they had very heavy weaponry.

1484
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,910

on there,

1489
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:26,390
on the top of their guns
and beneath their guns.

1490
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,940
They had like the
grenades strapped to them.

1491
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:29,460
Lastly,

1492
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,950

1493
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,381

1494
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:32,550
ammunition belt around them.

1495
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:33,781
I'm not crazy.

1496
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:33,931
Like,

1497
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:34,101

1498
00:44:34,101 --> 00:44:34,361

1502
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:38,460

1503
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:39,820
Uh,

1504
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,231
and then,

1505
00:44:40,231 --> 00:44:41,064
uh,

1506
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,171
I was talking to them,

1507
00:44:42,171 --> 00:44:44,560
I realized quickly this
would not self defense guys.

1508
00:44:44,561 --> 00:44:45,241
These would narco,

1509
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:46,074
these were gangsters.

1510
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:46,840
Them,

1511
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,120

1513
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,880

1514
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:49,070
right?

1515
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:49,903
They're like,

1516
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:50,460

1517
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:50,770
you know,

1518
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,031
I hadn't,

1519
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:53,170

1520
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,023
Oh,

1521
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,560
a couple of days now.

1522
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:56,060
And they're like,

1523
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,370
and then they had like guns
with like diamonds and hair fe,

1524
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,853
um,

1525
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,730
heifers down the boss.

1526
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,350
Um,

1527
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:04,891
and,

1528
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:05,724

1531
00:45:07,491 --> 00:45:08,191
it was kind of like,

1532
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:08,690
um,

1533
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:08,891
you know,

1534
00:45:08,891 --> 00:45:11,010
joking with his guys and take
some photographs of them.

1535
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,750
So they were posing for photographs,

1536
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:15,080
so it was sitting there with a,

1537
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,331
like,

1538
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:18,750
posing with the guns and
stuff in there and they said,

1539
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:19,700
they said they have a,

1540
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,620

1541
00:45:20,621 --> 00:45:21,120

1542
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,953
um,

1543
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,640
it's not really white boys like Blondie,

1544
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,350
you know,

1545
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:24,901
it could mean like,

1546
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:25,350
you know,

1547
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:25,751
if,

1548
00:45:25,751 --> 00:45:25,910
if,

1549
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:26,290
if you're,

1550
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,290
you're white in Mexico,

1551
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,320
he often get called a wetter.

1552
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:30,001
So like,

1553
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:30,780
where it all,

1554
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,613
um,

1555
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,350
how much the prostitutes
costs in your country.

1556
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:38,250
Like Gretchen did that you'd
have to go there and see it.

1557
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:40,530
There's like a Weirdo or do you like take,

1558
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,700
do you like taking meth?

1559
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:42,051
Do you,

1560
00:45:42,051 --> 00:45:42,380
don't you know,

1561
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:42,740
you like,

1562
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,573
like taking meth?

1563
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:44,540
Uh,

1564
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:44,800
you know,

1565
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:44,861
I'm,

1566
00:45:44,861 --> 00:45:45,694
I'm okay.

1567
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,070
And I,

1568
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:47,671
there was still like,

1569
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:47,770
no,

1570
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:48,451
you're kind of joking.

1571
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:49,290
And this guy turned,

1572
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,580
came up among them and he said,

1573
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,414
uh,

1574
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:51,660
the,

1575
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,880
I tell the other guys and
the first of the big guy,

1576
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,730
and he said that he was carrying a
big guy and he's got there woody,

1577
00:45:56,731 --> 00:45:57,630
massive head.

1578
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,611
And he said to me,

1579
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:00,171
a bit aggressive,

1580
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:01,110
he just don't take my photo.

1581
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:01,621
I was like,

1582
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:01,890
yeah,

1583
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:02,281
no problem.

1584
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:03,114
I won't take your photo.

1585
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:07,410
And then a guy came up and
said to the other guys,

1586
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:08,160
say,

1587
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,960
what are you doing this the Da guy here?

1588
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:10,261
He said,

1589
00:46:10,261 --> 00:46:13,410
the agent among you
taking your photographs,

1590
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,680
um,

1591
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:15,900
you know,

1592
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,531
what are you doing?

1593
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:17,364
And I was like,

1594
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,611
no,

1595
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:18,110
I'm not,

1596
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:18,990
I'm not even American.

1597
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,853
I'm British.

1598
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,031
And he said,

1599
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:21,141
no,

1600
00:46:21,141 --> 00:46:21,300
no,

1601
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,661
you know,

1602
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:22,500
this is a DEA guy.

1603
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:22,830
My,

1604
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:23,280
my,

1605
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,420
my brother was arrested in Texas and the
Dea guy pretended to be a journalist,

1606
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:28,231
you know,

1607
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:29,160
some bullshit story.

1608
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:30,721
And I said,

1609
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:30,910
look,

1610
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:31,440
I can,

1611
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:31,891
you know,

1612
00:46:31,891 --> 00:46:32,940
I can show you my website.

1613
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,990
So they've got the cell phone out and,

1614
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:37,501
and look through it,

1615
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:39,720
his cell phone and found out my website.

1616
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,320
And the guy calmed down a bit and he said,

1617
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:43,621
you know,

1618
00:46:43,621 --> 00:46:44,010
if you,

1619
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:44,880
if I see you,

1620
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,380
I'm going to put a bullet in your head,

1621
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,110
I'm going to throw a grenade at you.

1622
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,370
Is it?

1623
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,203
He added.

1624
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,580
So I left in,

1625
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:57,630
I kind of tried to talk
about a left and uh,

1626
00:46:58,740 --> 00:46:59,200
yeah.

1627
00:46:59,200 --> 00:46:59,380
And,

1628
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,330
and they went and then I didn't publish
the photographs I've still got and I

1629
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:06,020
both to photo ops and one of the guys
sent me an email saying what happened to

1630
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:06,863
photographs,

1631
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:08,190
my emails and my website.

1632
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,930
So I just ignored it.

1633
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,980
And I think a lot of them got killed in
a big fight they had with the federal

1634
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:15,750
police afterwards.

1635
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,593
So that was one.

1636
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,773
Um,

1637
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:19,151
and it's been,

1638
00:47:19,151 --> 00:47:19,261
yeah,

1639
00:47:19,261 --> 00:47:20,010
it's been a few more.

1640
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,360
So it's a lot of touch and go.

1641
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:21,770
Yeah.

1642
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:22,650
These situations.

1643
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,513
Yeah.

1644
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:24,420
The,

1645
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,530
the federal police,

1646
00:47:25,531 --> 00:47:29,920
do they have a plan to try to
eradicate these moms or is it

1647
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,540
a lot of lip service?

1648
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,030
Like,

1649
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:36,730
is it really possible to radically these
gangs or is it just one of those things

1650
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:39,730
where they say they're going to do
something but they have to kind of protect

1651
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:40,564
themselves?

1652
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:42,150
You know,

1653
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,660
there's,

1654
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,130
there's,

1655
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,930
there's been different different times.

1656
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:49,070
I mean sometimes there's been the federal
police have done well done after a

1657
00:47:49,071 --> 00:47:52,070
particular guy or sometimes
with the Americans.

1658
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,410
He no doubt been a,

1659
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,133
um,

1660
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,710
in our rest of very many
significant kingpins,

1661
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:03,370
the problem is his word is the door doing
a deeper questions is that like when

1662
00:48:04,911 --> 00:48:06,720
you take down some of these kingpins,

1663
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,460
you've always got other people who
will fight over their same territory.

1664
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,980
So for example,

1665
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,880
you take out Chapo Guzman and then you
get a fight among his sons and some odd

1666
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,860
one of his lieutenants over it,

1667
00:48:21,861 --> 00:48:22,694
over the empire.

1668
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:24,320
Now what's happened,

1669
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:27,920
and one of the reasons the violence has
increased in Mexico is because they've

1670
00:48:27,921 --> 00:48:32,300
had this onslaught attacking
cartels over the years.

1671
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:37,850
Then you end up with like the lieutenants
then taking over and then their

1672
00:48:37,851 --> 00:48:40,730
lieutenants taking over and then
their lieutenants taking over.

1673
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,650
That's what happened in Chicago as well.

1674
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,340
Or I spoke to a police officer in Chicago
and he said the violence escalated

1675
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:46,791
afterwards.

1676
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:48,590
Some big gang rests.

1677
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,360
And once they had gotten,

1678
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,330
some leaders have some gangs and
other people tried to fill the void.

1679
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,011
Yeah,

1680
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:54,611
exactly.

1681
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:54,971
Exactly.

1682
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:55,210
The sound.

1683
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:55,391
So,

1684
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:58,090
so then you get some of the
people who are in power now,

1685
00:48:58,850 --> 00:48:59,060
uh,

1686
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,370
like very young,

1687
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:04,480
very violent people and people who are
not as smart when those not as mature,

1688
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,433
not calculated.

1689
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:05,771
Yeah.

1690
00:49:05,771 --> 00:49:05,981
So,

1691
00:49:05,981 --> 00:49:07,600
so you to you and also
you end up with these,

1692
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:08,920
the fragmented territory.

1693
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:12,280
So you have people controlling
rather than having big cartel,

1694
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:16,250
some leader who controls it and a half
the country you end up with these cartel

1695
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,560
lethal allowed these gangs controlling
a part of the state now has one state

1696
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:21,394
called good Arrow,

1697
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:26,590
which you've seen this really light cartel
fragmentation and you've got maybe 12

1698
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:31,130
different groups in this one state and
you get like a place where they're going

1699
00:49:31,131 --> 00:49:34,420
to one controls controller up along a
road and then in our group controls it

1700
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,670
passing a certain point.

1701
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,700
So there was some,

1702
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,440
some friends went up there,

1703
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:42,310
um,

1704
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:47,230
seven journeys went up there and got held
up on this road up there 2017 as well.

1705
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,200
And they got,

1706
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:54,240
were in a car going like they're two
vehicles and about 200 guys blocked the

1707
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:59,660
road and the leader of this group was
a guy I believe called [inaudible].

1708
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,063
Um,

1709
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:01,601
like again,

1710
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:01,991
his name,

1711
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:02,710
blondie,

1712
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,550
polite and he's like maybe 23 years old,

1713
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,870
like 200 guys there.

1714
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:08,770
They said some of the kids,

1715
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:09,340
I talked to,

1716
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,790
one of the friends who was there and he
said some of these are kids who was the

1717
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:15,610
youngest like 10 years old
among this mob of people.

1718
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:16,850
And they,

1719
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:17,591
they held him up,

1720
00:50:17,591 --> 00:50:19,750
they took away their
VH one of the vehicles.

1721
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:20,980
They took away all their laptops,

1722
00:50:20,981 --> 00:50:21,431
cameras,

1723
00:50:21,431 --> 00:50:22,264
all that equipment,

1724
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:23,470
stuck them in the car,

1725
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:24,643
two go.

1726
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,070
Do you have to be careful when you're
traveling that you have like a,

1727
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:30,460
an obviously expensive laptop or camera,

1728
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,490
something along those lines.

1729
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,390
I think from the point of view of his,

1730
00:50:33,391 --> 00:50:33,541
you know,

1731
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:33,751
they can,

1732
00:50:33,751 --> 00:50:34,584
they can take it away.

1733
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:35,610
I'm going and it's happened a lot,

1734
00:50:35,611 --> 00:50:37,450
a lot of cases recently,

1735
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:39,210
colleagues just being robbed.

1736
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,270
Um,

1737
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,570
I mean you get like an armed group and
the take away that basically the hold

1738
00:50:43,571 --> 00:50:44,400
them down,

1739
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,240
take all their stuff.

1740
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:46,590
So you don't know sort of going,

1741
00:50:46,591 --> 00:50:47,700
I know various colleagues,

1742
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:48,571
photographers,

1743
00:50:48,571 --> 00:50:51,840
and if you're a freelance photographer
and you lose a good camera,

1744
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,220
uh,

1745
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:53,521
then,

1746
00:50:53,521 --> 00:50:54,330
uh,

1747
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:55,220
then in there like,

1748
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:55,770
you know,

1749
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:56,900
some of the TV people would have,

1750
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,590
they have less expensive
cameras and they used to,

1751
00:50:58,591 --> 00:50:59,640
I remember a few years ago,

1752
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,260
a TV group,

1753
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:01,560
uh,

1754
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,820
interviewed some gang members are in
Honduras and they stole their camera.

1755
00:51:05,821 --> 00:51:10,520
And it was at that time it was like an
$80,000 camera and the TV network on a

1756
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:13,920
say of what are the TV network apparently
was more pissed about losing the

1757
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:14,754
camera.

1758
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,430
It was about these guys,

1759
00:51:17,431 --> 00:51:17,690
you know,

1760
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,523
again,

1761
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:20,760
[inaudible] now having
guns pointed to them.

1762
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,850
What is the attitude in Mexico?

1763
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,230
Uh,

1764
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:29,230
a special amongst people who are
studying the narco wars with all this,

1765
00:51:29,941 --> 00:51:30,300
uh,

1766
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,710
build that wall stuff,

1767
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:32,970
all this,

1768
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,260
what's going on in America?

1769
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:35,123
There's this,

1770
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,110
this is very strange,

1771
00:51:37,111 --> 00:51:37,591
right?

1772
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:41,370
Versus left polarization over here about
whether or not there should be a wall

1773
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:42,990
between the United States and Mexico.

1774
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:43,970
Sure.

1775
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,803
I mean,

1776
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,381
well,

1777
00:51:45,381 --> 00:51:49,150
I mean the thing Mexican's are
obviously very anti Trump in Mexico.

1778
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,660
It's in a farm and I,

1779
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:54,860
Trump is very unpopular from
the very beginning when he said,

1780
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,990
I know they are rapists and murderers.

1781
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:57,350
Yeah.

1782
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,610
Someone's doing the raping.

1783
00:51:58,611 --> 00:51:59,150
Yeah.

1784
00:51:59,150 --> 00:51:59,620
How many?

1785
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:00,520
He's kind of United.

1786
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:01,730
You look at surveys,

1787
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,200
the level's very low.

1788
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,840
So is anybody like me?

1789
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,940
Trump in Mexico?

1790
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:06,231
I was there.

1791
00:52:06,231 --> 00:52:07,860
Like there's always contrarians.

1792
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,070
I've seen numbers like,

1793
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:10,440
you know,

1794
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,580
people will say like 80% or something.

1795
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,780
I think he's terrible.

1796
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:16,440
Sent means they must be
at 20% somewhere else.

1797
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,293
Don't.

1798
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:22,310
I haven't met a Mexican who's been
like pro Trump and I never have.

1799
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,910
I met a Salvadoran who
was pro Trump one time in,

1800
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,570
in the heated guy had been
deported and he was like,

1801
00:52:29,571 --> 00:52:30,021
I know you'll get,

1802
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:30,291
you know,

1803
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:30,681
this guy,

1804
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:32,300
Trump's going to turn out
to be a great president.

1805
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,020
So,

1806
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,040
so I see that.

1807
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:34,690
But you know,

1808
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:35,540
Mexico's very,

1809
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:39,020
very anti Trump in terms of the wall.

1810
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,280
I mean there's,

1811
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:40,491
you know,

1812
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:40,731
there's,

1813
00:52:40,731 --> 00:52:41,564
in terms of what

1814
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,780
I intended,

1815
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,420
the smugglers,

1816
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:50,420
mom was talking to a smuggler in Nogales
about this and he was describing he,

1817
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:51,320
he'd smile.

1818
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,360
He was from Nogales,

1819
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,980
from a neighborhood called Buenos Aires,

1820
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:57,950
which is right on the border
with the United States.

1821
00:52:57,951 --> 00:52:58,570
He has no god,

1822
00:52:58,570 --> 00:52:59,403
Sonora,

1823
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,343
Nogales,

1824
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,130
Arizona.

1825
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:01,950
So in August,

1826
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:02,260
um,

1827
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,380
so Noriega and Garth's Arizona.

1828
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,930
And he was from the neighborhood
right on the border there.

1829
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:12,340
And he described that he first took people
over the border of the United States

1830
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:15,020
back in the 1980s when he was at school.

1831
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,063
He's a high school.

1832
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,540
And the reason was that that time was
just an old fence and there was a hole in

1833
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:20,871
the fence.

1834
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:24,140
They used to go through into United
States and go back into Mexico to send old

1835
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,153
wire fence.

1836
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,440
And the first time he took people through,

1837
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:30,730
people would arrive from
southern Mexico saying,

1838
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:31,913
how do we get to the US?

1839
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:32,261
And he'd say,

1840
00:53:32,261 --> 00:53:32,371
Oh,

1841
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:32,610
you know,

1842
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:33,443
this way.

1843
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,800
And they give them a tip.

1844
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:38,550
He said the first time he
got the equivalent of about
50 cents was what you made

1845
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:40,530
to take people to the
United States 50 cents.

1846
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:42,350
Nowadays,

1847
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,960
the cost of going into the u s is $5,000.

1848
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:47,880
That's what you paid to go
legal in the United States.

1849
00:53:47,881 --> 00:53:48,780
5,000 bucks.

1850
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,251
So we were saying,

1851
00:53:50,251 --> 00:53:50,491
wow,

1852
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:53,850
look at that increase every time
that the u s puts more security,

1853
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,070
it means it's more expensive.

1854
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,600
When it's more expensive,

1855
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,910
that means more money going to criminals,

1856
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,430
which means there's not
an industry doing it.

1857
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:07,431
So now the cartels make a big percentage
of that money of human smuggling into

1858
00:54:08,491 --> 00:54:10,600
the u s um,

1859
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,180
by luck in terms of the wall,

1860
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:12,691
I mean the,

1861
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:13,524
uh,

1862
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:15,400
wait,

1863
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,050
when Trump first came in,

1864
00:54:17,051 --> 00:54:18,760
he had the line that
Mexico's going to pay for it.

1865
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:19,780
Yeah.

1866
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,240
And,

1867
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,170
and then it was this
kind of line in a right.

1868
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:22,601
The beginning,

1869
00:54:22,601 --> 00:54:23,020
he kinda,

1870
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,260
he threatened Mexican president saying,

1871
00:54:26,261 --> 00:54:26,441
if you,

1872
00:54:26,441 --> 00:54:29,140
if you don't agree to pay for the wall
and why are you going to come and meet

1873
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:29,974
me?

1874
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:31,360
And then it was like,

1875
00:54:31,361 --> 00:54:31,571
wow,

1876
00:54:31,571 --> 00:54:36,010
he's really going to try to shake down
in Mexico for like billions of dollars.

1877
00:54:36,011 --> 00:54:37,240
Is He really going to try and do that?

1878
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:38,471
Uh,

1879
00:54:38,471 --> 00:54:40,840
and that was kind of scary moment.

1880
00:54:40,841 --> 00:54:44,240
Then think from point of view of
Mexico when he first got to powers lie.

1881
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,800
He's going to do that and then he's going
to deport 3 million and he's going to,

1882
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:48,011
you know,

1883
00:54:48,011 --> 00:54:50,170
he's going to kill Nafta.

1884
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:51,670
Yeah.

1885
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:53,860
Actually those things
haven't really come to pass.

1886
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:54,191
Actually,

1887
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:57,190
if you look over the last couple of
years of Trump has some really hit Mexico

1888
00:54:57,191 --> 00:54:58,024
very hard.

1889
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,560
So the concern was that he was going to
take money that should be allocated to

1890
00:55:02,561 --> 00:55:03,490
other ways.

1891
00:55:03,491 --> 00:55:06,580
It's going to help Mexico and he was
going to try to take that and use it to

1892
00:55:06,581 --> 00:55:07,414
build the wall.

1893
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:08,621
I mean,

1894
00:55:08,621 --> 00:55:10,000
no one really knew when he first came in.

1895
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:10,211
He's like,

1896
00:55:10,211 --> 00:55:10,540
oh,

1897
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,950
Mexico's going to pay for this wall.

1898
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,250
Right?

1899
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,710
The Wall just got 10 foot higher.

1900
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:14,320
I remember that.

1901
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:14,570
Yeah.

1902
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,041
It was light.

1903
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:15,730
It was like in a,

1904
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:16,451
how are you going to do that?

1905
00:55:16,451 --> 00:55:16,661
You're going,

1906
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:18,820
are you going to start threatening
Mexican militarily and say,

1907
00:55:18,821 --> 00:55:19,481
give us money?

1908
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:19,751
I mean,

1909
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:20,471
it was kind of like,

1910
00:55:20,471 --> 00:55:20,980
uh,

1911
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:21,411
like is it a,

1912
00:55:21,411 --> 00:55:22,350
is it a shakedown?

1913
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:23,150
Good to shake down.

1914
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:23,501
It was kind of,

1915
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:26,740
it was kind of a crazy diplomatic
thing when he first got here.

1916
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,100
So that was kind of scary for a moment
from the point of view of Mexico.

1917
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:32,200
But I think after you look
at the last couple of years,

1918
00:55:32,201 --> 00:55:32,381
yes,

1919
00:55:32,381 --> 00:55:35,980
I'm really hit Mexico with and
now he wants to build the wall.

1920
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:36,921
Now as he does it,

1921
00:55:36,921 --> 00:55:39,460
there's the big fasten in
terms of the spending here,

1922
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,680
but if he wants to build it,

1923
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,013
uh,

1924
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:44,981
or Extendix,

1925
00:55:44,981 --> 00:55:46,290
there is warden sections of the border.

1926
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:47,124
We're ready.

1927
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,430
If he wants to extend it,

1928
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:48,821
you know,

1929
00:55:48,821 --> 00:55:49,690
it won't stop.

1930
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,890
A lot of the hard drugs.

1931
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:52,391
I mean,

1932
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,560
if you look at heroin,

1933
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:54,371
cocaine,

1934
00:55:54,371 --> 00:55:54,881
crystal Meth,

1935
00:55:54,881 --> 00:55:55,840
high value drugs,

1936
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,240
they normally go through
the ports of entry,

1937
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,050
right?

1938
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:00,160
So shipping.

1939
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:00,700
Yeah,

1940
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,533
I mean they go,

1941
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:01,950
oh,

1942
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:02,783
or through the,

1943
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:04,270
through the ports of entry through Leica.

1944
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,070
I mean you have a through in cost,

1945
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:06,760
right?

1946
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,780
Because trucks,

1947
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:08,531
I mean,

1948
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:08,771
you,

1949
00:56:08,771 --> 00:56:09,401
you go through,

1950
00:56:09,401 --> 00:56:12,450
if you look at the Laredo in Laredo,

1951
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,313
Laredo,

1952
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,430
one of the reasons that was a big fight
in the war started there in Mexico

1953
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,040
because that's a very valuable territory.

1954
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:22,750
There's something like 8,000 trucks
go over that border every day.

1955
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:24,221
Now,

1956
00:56:24,221 --> 00:56:25,480
if you have 8,000 trucks,

1957
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,060
how many of those can use search in a day?

1958
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,480
And also the way they can
hide this stuff in trucks,

1959
00:56:31,481 --> 00:56:35,410
they can hide drugs in like a metal.

1960
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,640
They can put them in,

1961
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:36,820
in,

1962
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,470
in some kind of metal container,

1963
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:39,700
seal it up,

1964
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,840
soldier it up,

1965
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:41,980
put a bunch of,

1966
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,030
so who doesn't smell?

1967
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:44,381
So somebody has to say,

1968
00:56:44,381 --> 00:56:45,910
I'm going to open that with a blowtorch.

1969
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:50,290
And as a searching after rip that
vehicle apart to find the drugs,

1970
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,180
they were putting them inside wheels.

1971
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:53,563
Yay.

1972
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,250
Yay.

1973
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,400
Mass inside ties and stuff.

1974
00:56:56,401 --> 00:56:57,234
That's like the,

1975
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,173
that's like,

1976
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:58,980
there's song,

1977
00:56:58,980 --> 00:56:59,290
there's a,

1978
00:56:59,290 --> 00:56:59,610
is it,

1979
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:01,030
that's one of the older tricks from the,

1980
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:01,601
like the 70.

1981
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:02,231
There's a song that is,

1982
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:02,560
uh,

1983
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,840
one of the first narco
corridos their drug ballots.

1984
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,010
Um,

1985
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:06,341
Eh,

1986
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:11,341
it was called contraband and trend
treason for the 1970s and that was about

1987
00:57:11,951 --> 00:57:12,450
hiring,

1988
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:13,030
uh,

1989
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,910
hiding marijuana back in
the nine tires back then.

1990
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:16,151
But yeah,

1991
00:57:16,151 --> 00:57:16,590
me now,

1992
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:17,620
the trap cars now,

1993
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:18,730
like super sophisticated,

1994
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,110
they have some weird trap cars.

1995
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:23,620
We have to do like a bunch
of stuff like open the door,

1996
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,790
move some staff to actually to
actually open file the drugs.

1997
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:28,540
Other slight,

1998
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,220
some trick sort of door
has to be actively.

1999
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:32,411
Yeah,

2000
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:33,490
I would imagine if there's a will,

2001
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,780
there's a way there's that much.

2002
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:35,801
I mean,

2003
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:37,600
I remember hearing that from,

2004
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:37,901
I mean,

2005
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:39,010
it's not a reliable source,

2006
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:42,520
but from the Sopranos there we're talking
about only 20% of all the shipping

2007
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:44,800
containers or get brought
into America gets searched.

2008
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:45,490
Yeah.

2009
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:46,270
Well that's,

2010
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:47,103
that's crazy.

2011
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:47,291
Yeah.

2012
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:47,441
Yeah.

2013
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:47,950
Absolutely.

2014
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:48,191
So,

2015
00:57:48,191 --> 00:57:48,431
so,

2016
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:49,051
so to the,

2017
00:57:49,051 --> 00:57:51,540
the hard drugs and learned a
lot of time on through the,

2018
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:52,250
the,

2019
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,890
the ports of entry and,

2020
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,470
and they have their data and other
classic trick they have is you get,

2021
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,120
they allow some to get busted.

2022
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,770
So you allow one guy to get
busted and they set somebody up.

2023
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,480
So they're taking some drugs through,

2024
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:04,841
they get,

2025
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:07,300
they get busted or the f entities on them,

2026
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:09,310
and then meanwhile more
drugs are going through.

2027
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:12,340
And is this the United States border?

2028
00:58:12,341 --> 00:58:13,060
That's tests.

2029
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,770
That's catching this guy.

2030
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:15,990
Yeah.

2031
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:16,310
Yeah.

2032
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,170
So they're not getting,

2033
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,890
they're not getting tested
in Mexico as they crossover,

2034
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,111
right?

2035
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:21,430
It's only in the United States border.

2036
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:21,851
Yeah.

2037
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:22,121
Some,

2038
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:25,240
sometimes they might catch
him in Mexico sometimes,

2039
00:58:25,241 --> 00:58:26,860
but the majority is gonna
be the United States.

2040
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,040
So the United States border patrol guys,

2041
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,780
are they ever caught being corrupt?

2042
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,171
Yeah,

2043
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:32,591
absolutely.

2044
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:32,830
Yeah.

2045
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:34,750
There's been cases of us,

2046
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:40,110
border patrol and customs
entry people who have been,

2047
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:40,720
yeah.

2048
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,950
Caught taking a bunch of money,

2049
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:43,001
taking bribes,

2050
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:46,360
allowing in our land certain cars
through the course Sandvik was through.

2051
00:58:46,361 --> 00:58:47,170
So yeah.

2052
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:48,610
How does one fix this?

2053
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:48,851
I mean,

2054
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:50,050
if you had a magic wand,

2055
00:58:50,051 --> 00:58:53,350
you were going to wave it over
Mexico and fix this problem.

2056
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:54,940
Like if you,

2057
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,610
if somebody said you on,

2058
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:57,700
you're a smart guy,

2059
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:00,030
you've been in the
business for a long time,

2060
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,980
we're going to let you
dictate how this takes place.

2061
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:03,971
So I'd say,

2062
00:59:03,971 --> 00:59:04,210
yeah,

2063
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:04,841
three things.

2064
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,250
So like drug policy reform.

2065
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,710
So we've got to talk about how
we deal with his drug situation.

2066
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,640
So I mean like a mirror.

2067
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:11,590
I mean,

2068
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,730
I mean some of that is,

2069
00:59:13,731 --> 00:59:14,201
is here,

2070
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:14,561
isn't it?

2071
00:59:14,561 --> 00:59:17,020
And you probably got a better
idea than me about how to,

2072
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:18,271
why American,

2073
00:59:18,271 --> 00:59:19,570
what Americans takes so many drugs.

2074
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:22,520
I mean I got from a drug
taking myself in the UK,

2075
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:22,891
our guess.

2076
00:59:22,891 --> 00:59:24,740
So maybe it's not that different.

2077
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,430
I think there's a lot of answers to that.

2078
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:27,940
Uh,

2079
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:32,940
the biggest one is entirely that most
people don't enjoy what they do and they

2080
00:59:34,421 --> 00:59:35,254
want an escape.

2081
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,000
I think that's probably the biggest one.

2082
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:38,343
The,

2083
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,170
there's some ridiculous
number that was just a,

2084
00:59:41,171 --> 00:59:44,040
we're just who discussing the
number on the podcast have a,

2085
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,580
how many people actually was it?

2086
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,890
It was a Johann Hari,

2087
00:59:47,891 --> 00:59:48,724
wasn't it?

2088
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,193
Yeah.

2089
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:52,720
He was talking about the number of
people that actually enjoy their job.

2090
00:59:52,721 --> 00:59:57,721
67% people have in this country
don't like what they do or you know,

2091
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,030
are just

2092
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,020
sleepwalking through their life.

2093
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:06,310
There's a another significant
percent that hate what they do.

2094
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,420
And then there's a few leftover
that love what they do.

2095
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,950
I mean it's a very small number of
people maybe like myself or maybe like

2096
01:00:14,951 --> 01:00:18,100
yourself that actually enjoy what they
do for a living and feel like they're

2097
01:00:18,101 --> 01:00:19,120
following their passion.

2098
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,880
Most people were just working
a job and they fucking hate it.

2099
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:23,380
And then when they get off work,

2100
01:00:23,381 --> 01:00:24,370
they want to get fucked up.

2101
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,200
And a lot of these people,

2102
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:26,680
you know,

2103
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,040
they're,

2104
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,260
they have psychological issues.

2105
01:00:29,261 --> 01:00:30,610
They're suffering from abuse,

2106
01:00:30,611 --> 01:00:31,630
childhood abuse.

2107
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:32,861
They're trying to,

2108
01:00:32,861 --> 01:00:37,120
I mean there's been some significant
statistics about childhood abuse and how

2109
01:00:37,121 --> 01:00:40,810
many people from childhood abuse wind
up using and abusing drugs and becoming

2110
01:00:40,811 --> 01:00:42,670
addicted and even overdosing on drugs.

2111
01:00:42,671 --> 01:00:44,470
And it's ridiculously high.

2112
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,670
It's about pain,

2113
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,970
pain and suffering and trying to remove
that pain and suffering from your life.

2114
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:50,583
And um,

2115
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:51,401
you know,

2116
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:56,170
people that don't know how to make healthy
choices and don't have friends that

2117
01:00:56,171 --> 01:00:59,230
are making healthy choices and don't
know what to do with their life.

2118
01:00:59,320 --> 01:00:59,891
That's a big,

2119
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:00,461
big part of it.

2120
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:03,460
There's another part of it that's because
it's illegal cause something about

2121
01:01:03,461 --> 01:01:06,100
things that are illegal that
are intoxicating and enticing.

2122
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:06,701
You know,

2123
01:01:06,701 --> 01:01:11,020
when you look at the statistics in
Holland in particular where marijuana has

2124
01:01:11,021 --> 01:01:11,440
been,

2125
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:11,711
you know,

2126
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:13,330
you could buy it in coffee shops forever.

2127
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,910
Not that many people smoke
marijuana in Holland.

2128
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:16,601
It's a lot of,

2129
01:01:16,601 --> 01:01:16,930
uh,

2130
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:18,280
marijuana tourism,

2131
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,760
especially back in the day now that
America has legal marijuana almost

2132
01:01:24,101 --> 01:01:24,700
everywhere.

2133
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,910
Not a lot of people are going to
Holland specifically to get fucked up.

2134
01:01:27,911 --> 01:01:29,350
But there was always the thing,

2135
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:29,591
man,

2136
01:01:29,591 --> 01:01:30,430
when we were younger,

2137
01:01:30,431 --> 01:01:31,151
it was always a guy.

2138
01:01:31,151 --> 01:01:32,680
He's going to go to
Holland and go get high.

2139
01:01:32,681 --> 01:01:33,514
Like

2140
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:34,910
I won't know.

2141
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:35,030
No,

2142
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:35,630
I used to go there,

2143
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,390
one of the teenage well but never
there for some of that on a,

2144
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:38,730
on a,

2145
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,270
on a boat and arrived in Amsterdam,

2146
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:41,570
uh,

2147
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:42,310
back in those days.

2148
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:43,143
Yeah.

2149
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,350
It actually,

2150
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:45,230
it made me,

2151
01:01:45,231 --> 01:01:46,280
made me swell small.

2152
01:01:46,281 --> 01:01:48,860
What you're saying is they're
about enjoying the job and is true.

2153
01:01:48,861 --> 01:01:49,071
I mean,

2154
01:01:49,071 --> 01:01:49,904
when he said that,

2155
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,300
um,

2156
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,220
I do love what I do and enjoy what I do.

2157
01:01:52,221 --> 01:01:54,620
So that's what Intel is one
of the size of that thing.

2158
01:01:54,621 --> 01:01:54,891
But,

2159
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:55,724
uh,

2160
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:56,391
but yeah,

2161
01:01:56,391 --> 01:01:56,601
so,

2162
01:01:56,601 --> 01:01:57,051
so I mean,

2163
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:59,150
in terms of the issue of drugs,

2164
01:01:59,151 --> 01:02:00,080
we have to talk about this.

2165
01:02:00,081 --> 01:02:04,220
How can we stop American stop spending
that money or allowed that money if it's

2166
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:08,720
going to be spent not to be going to a
black market and Andy stabilizing these

2167
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:09,554
countries,

2168
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,060
but also a lot of issues in,

2169
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,350
in Mexico as well.

2170
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:13,243
Uh,

2171
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:13,941
like again,

2172
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:14,870
that social work,

2173
01:02:14,871 --> 01:02:16,310
how do you change the reality?

2174
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:17,301
And again,

2175
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:18,134
so you know,

2176
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:21,270
people who are abused
and suffer taking drugs,

2177
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:25,730
but people who are abusing suffer
in Latin America becoming assassins.

2178
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:26,370
Yes.

2179
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:27,690
Because one of the weird things,

2180
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:28,051
and on a,

2181
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:29,400
on a moral level,

2182
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,570
on a level of morality.

2183
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:35,490
And I knew a lot of kids growing up who
sold drugs and there wasn't really an

2184
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:37,920
amazing and moral thing to
think about in I sell drugs.

2185
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,970
He was an easy step to take on a sim out,

2186
01:02:39,971 --> 01:02:40,571
sell some weed,

2187
01:02:40,571 --> 01:02:44,160
and then I'm gonna sell some speed and
sell some ecstasy and then layer on

2188
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:45,150
heroin or would ever,

2189
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,120
but for somebody to commit a murder,

2190
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:49,620
that seems like a bigger,

2191
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:50,611
a lot bigger deal.

2192
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:51,391
How'd you get into,

2193
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,390
how'd you crossed that line
to becoming a murderer?

2194
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,800
How do they cross that line so

2195
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:56,590
easily?

2196
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:56,711
Well,

2197
01:02:56,711 --> 01:02:59,470
I think it goes back to that young
boy that you were talking about,

2198
01:02:59,471 --> 01:02:59,891
the butcher,

2199
01:02:59,891 --> 01:03:00,724
that family,

2200
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:03,190
he was abandoned and angry and hurt.

2201
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,010
So much pain and the suffering,

2202
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,150
that's often the case.

2203
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:08,980
They want other people to suffer when,

2204
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,520
when you see people that are
doing terrible things to be,

2205
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,030
but they're almost always suffering.

2206
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,810
They're almost almost always wanting
other people to feel what they feel.

2207
01:03:16,811 --> 01:03:17,920
They're lashing out.

2208
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:19,001
That's,

2209
01:03:19,001 --> 01:03:19,834
uh,

2210
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:20,201
that,

2211
01:03:20,201 --> 01:03:24,190
that social work aspect that you're
discussing so critical and something that

2212
01:03:24,191 --> 01:03:29,191
we've discussed about this country
that how few people are putting,

2213
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:30,251
I mean,

2214
01:03:30,251 --> 01:03:30,470
how,

2215
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:32,230
and very few politicians,

2216
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:36,820
very few people that are running this
country are putting efforts into try to

2217
01:03:36,821 --> 01:03:41,821
heal these communities that have suffered
from just years and years of systemic

2218
01:03:43,451 --> 01:03:44,141
racism,

2219
01:03:44,141 --> 01:03:47,050
years and years of just embedded poverty.

2220
01:03:47,051 --> 01:03:51,940
That's almost impossible to escape years
and years of crime and drugs and just

2221
01:03:51,941 --> 01:03:53,710
growing up in this community of despair,

2222
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,840
this is what you were
talking about with Baltimore.

2223
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:59,530
This is what we're talking about with
south side of Chicago and various cities

2224
01:03:59,531 --> 01:04:00,520
all over this country.

2225
01:04:00,521 --> 01:04:01,150
It just,

2226
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:02,200
they don't get better,

2227
01:04:02,201 --> 01:04:02,650
man.

2228
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:04,690
They date stay fucked up.

2229
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:05,520
You know.

2230
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:05,770
Um,

2231
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:10,150
I had Michael Wood who is a police officer
from Baltimore and he was discussing

2232
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:15,130
what it was like being in Baltimore as a
police officer and then looking at some

2233
01:04:15,131 --> 01:04:20,050
documents from the 1970s that detailed
the crime in the very same areas that he

2234
01:04:20,051 --> 01:04:24,670
was patrolling in and this the
same crime in the same areas.

2235
01:04:24,671 --> 01:04:29,050
And this sense of just
overwhelming futility.

2236
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,720
Like there was nothing that
he was going to be able to do.

2237
01:04:31,721 --> 01:04:33,100
There's going to put a dent in this,

2238
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,110
cause this was a lot of,

2239
01:04:35,111 --> 01:04:40,090
it was a product of in these areas in
Baltimore where there was law that you

2240
01:04:40,091 --> 01:04:44,110
were not allowed to sell homes to
black people in these certain areas.

2241
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,840
So they kept these people
in these poor areas.

2242
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:49,870
And even though they had this
desire to escape into the,

2243
01:04:49,871 --> 01:04:52,300
the more affluent or safer communities,

2244
01:04:52,301 --> 01:04:54,460
they weren't allowed to for a long time.

2245
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:55,121
I mean,

2246
01:04:55,121 --> 01:04:58,150
there's so much of that
in this country that the,

2247
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:58,601
you know,

2248
01:04:58,601 --> 01:04:59,830
the people that are in control,

2249
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:01,420
but everybody just wants to get elected.

2250
01:05:01,421 --> 01:05:02,530
Everybody just wants to,

2251
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:03,101
you know,

2252
01:05:03,101 --> 01:05:04,120
and then once they get elected,

2253
01:05:04,121 --> 01:05:05,800
then they're looking to get reelected.

2254
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:08,980
So they spend a gigantic percentage
of their time campaigning.

2255
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:09,790
No,

2256
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:14,790
there's no universal effort on the part
of all the citizens of the country to

2257
01:05:14,951 --> 01:05:16,720
try to look at all these areas and say,

2258
01:05:16,721 --> 01:05:16,871
hey,

2259
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:17,350
these,

2260
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,280
this is us.

2261
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:18,791
You know,

2262
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:21,040
just because you don't live
in the south side of Chicago,

2263
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:22,270
that those are human beings.

2264
01:05:22,271 --> 01:05:23,350
Those are just like you.

2265
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:23,890
And I,

2266
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:25,060
you could have been them.

2267
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:26,110
They could have been you.

2268
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,350
If they were you when you were them,

2269
01:05:28,351 --> 01:05:29,860
wouldn't you hope that you would help?

2270
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:33,760
Wouldn't you hope that someone would
come in and try to fix this area?

2271
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:34,920
Someone would try to Portman.

2272
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,830
We pour so much money in the foreign
countries we pour so much money in is

2273
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:43,030
subsidizing various industries
that a lot of people disagree with.

2274
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:43,591
You know,

2275
01:05:43,591 --> 01:05:43,990
and there's,

2276
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:44,321
I mean,

2277
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:45,280
I'm not an economist.

2278
01:05:45,281 --> 01:05:47,860
I Dunno what economic sense
that on any of that stuff makes.

2279
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:52,750
But I do know that money is allocated in
a lot of different ways and the idea is

2280
01:05:52,751 --> 01:05:54,340
that it's going to be
better for all of us.

2281
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:54,731
Well,

2282
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:58,270
it's not better for all of us to keep
these communities as fucked up as they are

2283
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,050
right now.

2284
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:00,310
And there's no effort,

2285
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,293
nothing.

2286
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:02,530
Very little done.

2287
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:03,670
No movement,

2288
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,713
no change,

2289
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:05,980
no gigantic step,

2290
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:06,310
no,

2291
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:10,000
no 10 year plan to
eradicate gang violence.

2292
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:13,390
No 10 year plan to radicating
illegal drug sales and murder.

2293
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:14,630
So the,

2294
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:15,920
this great social work,

2295
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:17,870
they're awesome quest social
workers down there and said it.

2296
01:06:17,871 --> 01:06:19,490
Awesome heroes in these places.

2297
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:23,180
And they're somebody I talked
to a lot based set up YDS,

2298
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,960
[inaudible] Sandra who grew
up in the neighborhoods.

2299
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:28,370
You're one of the first
people to introduce me to a
young gang members in this,

2300
01:06:28,371 --> 01:06:29,204
in this area.

2301
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:29,990
Um,

2302
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,040
she used to work in a factory,

2303
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:34,840
they're going to social work and
now she's a psychologist and she,

2304
01:06:34,841 --> 01:06:34,951
yeah,

2305
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:35,121
she,

2306
01:06:35,121 --> 01:06:38,080
I mean she's somebody who who really
will do the work and reach people and,

2307
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:39,560
and like save lives.

2308
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:40,430
Um,

2309
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:40,971
and you know,

2310
01:06:40,971 --> 01:06:41,331
somebody,

2311
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:41,511
you know,

2312
01:06:41,511 --> 01:06:44,300
basic stuff you really get
in the community and try
and reach and they have to

2313
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:46,820
reach the kids when they're often 12,

2314
01:06:46,821 --> 01:06:47,181
11,

2315
01:06:47,181 --> 01:06:50,030
12 and you can often see
in these areas who are,

2316
01:06:50,031 --> 01:06:51,320
the kids are going to get into this,

2317
01:06:51,321 --> 01:06:52,940
who are going to be
recruited by the cartels,

2318
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:56,210
who are going to get to gangs because
there's certain profiles in these people.

2319
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,260
They haven't got their families.

2320
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,260
I was talking to some guys in,

2321
01:06:59,261 --> 01:07:02,000
in also set up wireless
from the battery last Deca,

2322
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:02,660
which is the,

2323
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:06,560
one of the big gangs there started in the
u s actually among prisoners in spread

2324
01:07:06,561 --> 01:07:11,270
into Mexico and became almost
like a paramilitary group
in Mexico about how they

2325
01:07:11,271 --> 01:07:12,890
recruit people.

2326
01:07:12,891 --> 01:07:13,850
And then this guy was saying,

2327
01:07:13,851 --> 01:07:14,031
look,

2328
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:14,301
you know,

2329
01:07:14,301 --> 01:07:15,970
we will see in our,

2330
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:19,970
I can see from these young kids who's
going to be able to kill and you know

2331
01:07:19,971 --> 01:07:21,530
who's going to be a real
fight and who's not.

2332
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:25,220
And if these people have gotten
parents who love them and so forth,

2333
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:25,941
these guys aren't going to,

2334
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:26,774
aren't going to,

2335
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:27,770
they're not going to work for me.

2336
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:28,551
I need,

2337
01:07:28,551 --> 01:07:30,020
I need someone who's like got hate,

2338
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,580
who's calling to anger in them.

2339
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:32,210
And I can,

2340
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:33,450
I can do something with one of those.

2341
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:36,680
It's kind of about the perverse
opposite of this stuff really.

2342
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:39,320
But so if people don't have that families,

2343
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:40,460
and this makes my guess,

2344
01:07:40,461 --> 01:07:43,280
think a bit more sympathize,

2345
01:07:43,281 --> 01:07:44,021
I guess as well too.

2346
01:07:44,021 --> 01:07:44,161
You know,

2347
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:44,390
the,

2348
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,400
the idea of how important family is,

2349
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:48,590
handball and loving parents is,

2350
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,071
you know,

2351
01:07:49,071 --> 01:07:50,240
whether you're together or separate,

2352
01:07:50,241 --> 01:07:50,660
leaner,

2353
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:51,560
loving parents,

2354
01:07:51,561 --> 01:07:52,010
you know,

2355
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:53,260
having that and uh,

2356
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:54,943
uh,

2357
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:55,970
but if you don't have that,

2358
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:56,151
you know,

2359
01:07:56,151 --> 01:07:58,790
you need social work and new people
are going to offer something and try.

2360
01:07:58,791 --> 01:07:59,900
And now though there was a,

2361
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:01,700
an interesting mayor of Midian,

2362
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:02,751
good,

2363
01:08:02,751 --> 01:08:06,440
Andrea Guajardo and he had these ideas
of trying to change the reality of the

2364
01:08:06,441 --> 01:08:07,940
city and he said,

2365
01:08:07,941 --> 01:08:08,900
I'm going to build the most,

2366
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:10,010
he was a mathematician.

2367
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:12,200
So I've got to see us as
a mathematical problem,

2368
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:13,543
this issue.

2369
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:17,900
And I'm going to build the beautiful
building and the ugliest part of the city

2370
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:22,730
and the worst part of the city to
make and force people who want to see.

2371
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:27,050
We made a conservatory and put it in
there in the poorest neighborhood so that

2372
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:30,470
people who want to be in this
conceptually have to travel to the poorest

2373
01:08:30,471 --> 01:08:33,260
neighborhood and go there and
try and change the reality.

2374
01:08:33,261 --> 01:08:34,640
Because if you see around you,

2375
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:37,070
a horrible neighborhood at dusk street,

2376
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:37,611
no light,

2377
01:08:37,611 --> 01:08:39,050
nothing working in a,

2378
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:39,861
what do you turn into?

2379
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:41,960
And if you see a nice
environment around you,

2380
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,610
can you change people that way?

2381
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:44,661
Wow.

2382
01:08:44,661 --> 01:08:45,494
How did it work?

2383
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:46,971
It for a while,

2384
01:08:46,971 --> 01:08:49,230
it's hard to know exactly
because also there was a,

2385
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:53,010
a truce between some of the
gangsters there as well for awhile.

2386
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,080
Um,

2387
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,330
was it related to the
construction of the conservatory?

2388
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:56,640
I,

2389
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,300
the theme I have met and have the
government was involved in the Theresa on

2390
01:08:59,330 --> 01:08:59,871
truth or not,

2391
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:03,830
but there was for a time the murder rate
did drop quite dramatically in Midian.

2392
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,353
Um,

2393
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:06,141
I,

2394
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:08,880
not that I have people have carried
on in a bit meti and has improved.

2395
01:09:08,881 --> 01:09:12,020
And Medi Medi in Columbia was the worst,

2396
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,920
the most violent city in the world
back in the 1990s and it's not in an

2397
01:09:15,921 --> 01:09:16,281
industry,

2398
01:09:16,281 --> 01:09:16,550
you know,

2399
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,410
people do like their city now in Midian.

2400
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:19,910
Wow.

2401
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,710
So it had some impact.

2402
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:21,891
Yeah,

2403
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:22,311
absolutely.

2404
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:22,490
Yeah.

2405
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:23,450
And the social workers,

2406
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:25,850
I'm sure they have some
impact on individual people,

2407
01:09:25,851 --> 01:09:30,080
but I would imagine that the overwhelming
volume of children that are being

2408
01:09:30,081 --> 01:09:30,914
recruited,

2409
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,140
that it's very hard to
put a real dent in it.

2410
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:36,860
But I think in out quite has it had an
effect because when that was the most

2411
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:39,560
violent city in the world around 2010,

2412
01:09:39,561 --> 01:09:43,730
2011 and now is this turf war
there between the Sinaloa cartel,

2413
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,840
which is Chapo Guzman
against local widest cartel.

2414
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:49,890
And there was a,

2415
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:53,150
there was 9,000 killed in that
city over four years of that,

2416
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:54,043
of that war.

2417
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,131
It was crazy.

2418
01:09:55,131 --> 01:09:55,964
I was covering,

2419
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:58,820
covering it then to just driving
around from scene to scene and be like,

2420
01:09:59,420 --> 01:09:59,571
yeah,

2421
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:00,201
massacre here.

2422
01:10:00,201 --> 01:10:01,610
Masker they're just driving around,

2423
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:01,971
Bang,

2424
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:02,270
Bang,

2425
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:03,103
this things happening.

2426
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,430
And afterwards there was a lot
of social work put into the city.

2427
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:08,571
Um,

2428
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:09,980
and Sandra described by lunch,

2429
01:10:09,981 --> 01:10:10,641
they said there's,

2430
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:10,851
there's,

2431
01:10:10,851 --> 01:10:11,684
uh,

2432
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,640
um,

2433
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,000
I like a waterfall of,

2434
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,170
of aid money coming in.

2435
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:18,380
There was like us in a USA ID and stuff.

2436
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:22,790
We stopped putting money into this and
other different groups and the murder

2437
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:23,900
rate did really drop.

2438
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:25,041
So,

2439
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:27,620
and it hasn't gone back
up to that level since.

2440
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:32,240
So I think it does have a real
effect when it's put as a policy.

2441
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:33,560
Um,

2442
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,970
and it does have an
effect on these things.

2443
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:36,421
But also when you,

2444
01:10:36,421 --> 01:10:38,930
you talked a little while ago
about a magic wand on this,

2445
01:10:38,931 --> 01:10:39,240
I mean,

2446
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:43,790
in making a police force that actually
protects the community or making a police

2447
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:45,470
force that has some kind of effect.

2448
01:10:45,471 --> 01:10:45,621
I mean,

2449
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:47,390
I grew up in England,

2450
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:49,670
which is in a pretty safe place,

2451
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,400
relatively in Nice and not
like police and you know,

2452
01:10:52,401 --> 01:10:55,280
hate the no beer anti police
would ever growing up.

2453
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,170
Um,

2454
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,440
and now I appreciate,

2455
01:10:57,441 --> 01:10:57,801
wow.

2456
01:10:57,801 --> 01:10:57,951
You know,

2457
01:10:57,951 --> 01:11:01,400
you have police who actually protect
community in some way and the same in the

2458
01:11:01,401 --> 01:11:02,151
United States.

2459
01:11:02,151 --> 01:11:03,260
I mean the United States,

2460
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,180
the police do protect people to a large
extent compared to these countries.

2461
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:10,610
And in obviously the tissues,

2462
01:11:10,611 --> 01:11:13,680
here is our issue of racism and
killing and violence and so forth.

2463
01:11:13,681 --> 01:11:14,610
But still,

2464
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,560
I think a lot of the people who,

2465
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,420
who believe that they know,

2466
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:21,750
a lot of people believe they
have guns for self defense.

2467
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:24,240
And I respect the right to
have constant for self defense.

2468
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:29,850
But really in America you're generally
safe because the police are pretty hard

2469
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:30,870
on clamping down.

2470
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:35,730
But how do you create a police force which
really has the will to protect people

2471
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:36,601
in a,

2472
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:37,530
how do you have that,

2473
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:37,850
you know,

2474
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:38,220
uh,

2475
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:38,521
with the,

2476
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:39,170
with the,

2477
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:43,380
the word and the passion and the
commitment to help people in Mexico.

2478
01:11:43,381 --> 01:11:43,980
That would be,

2479
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:44,813
that'd be a dream.

2480
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:48,930
The people that have dealt with police
officers that are corrupt have a very

2481
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:50,950
difficult time hearing what
you're saying right there.

2482
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:53,910
Those people would be angry
or what you're saying saying,

2483
01:11:53,911 --> 01:11:54,061
no,

2484
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:54,121
no,

2485
01:11:54,121 --> 01:11:54,360
no,

2486
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,190
the police officer's here are corrupt.

2487
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:56,971
They are bad.

2488
01:11:56,971 --> 01:11:57,870
There is racism.

2489
01:11:57,871 --> 01:11:58,830
There are real problems.

2490
01:11:58,860 --> 01:11:59,630
Yeah.

2491
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:00,090
Um,

2492
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:00,601
and there is,

2493
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:03,450
but I think there's also real
problem being a police officer,

2494
01:12:03,451 --> 01:12:03,961
period.

2495
01:12:03,961 --> 01:12:08,550
I think police officers have an insanely
difficult job and I think most of them

2496
01:12:08,551 --> 01:12:09,840
are dealing with PTSD.

2497
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:11,580
I think there's a giant
percentage of them.

2498
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:15,060
Like all over the world
and in America too,

2499
01:12:15,061 --> 01:12:19,200
that are constantly dealing with
violence and the threat of violence and

2500
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,760
arresting criminals and being
shot at and people lying to them.

2501
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:24,930
I just don't think,

2502
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:30,000
I think most people are very ill
equipped to handle something like that.

2503
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,333
I mean,

2504
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:32,183
I agree there's,

2505
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:35,340
there are definitely problems with
the police and there are problems.

2506
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:35,971
I mean,

2507
01:12:35,971 --> 01:12:37,630
the police shootings are rare,

2508
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:38,610
very real problems.

2509
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:39,360
Uh,

2510
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:39,631
please,

2511
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:41,310
killing innocent people here is very real.

2512
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:42,080
Uh,

2513
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,620
and you've always got
to look for improvement.

2514
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,011
And you know,

2515
01:12:44,011 --> 01:12:44,581
there's people,

2516
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:46,110
families against suffering from that,

2517
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:47,063
from that violence.

2518
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:48,510
I don't want to belittle this.

2519
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:48,841
No,

2520
01:12:48,841 --> 01:12:49,051
no,

2521
01:12:49,051 --> 01:12:49,591
you're not.

2522
01:12:49,591 --> 01:12:50,171
I know you're not,

2523
01:12:50,171 --> 01:12:53,100
I just have to sort of clarify because
I know so many people would be hearing

2524
01:12:53,101 --> 01:12:53,551
this and going,

2525
01:12:53,551 --> 01:12:53,731
yeah,

2526
01:12:53,731 --> 01:12:54,780
Mexico is terrible.

2527
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,673
The United States,

2528
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:56,280
there's,

2529
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:56,491
I mean,

2530
01:12:56,491 --> 01:12:58,260
there's a ton of videos.

2531
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:02,940
The real issue though is we're also
dealing with the sheer number of

2532
01:13:02,941 --> 01:13:07,830
interactions of police have with people
with the vast majority of them are fine.

2533
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:08,360
Yeah.

2534
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:08,870
The sound,

2535
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:09,040
the,

2536
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:09,541
the other thing,

2537
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:09,751
like,

2538
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:12,300
say that the crime of kidnapping
kidnappings are horrific.

2539
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:13,080
Uh,

2540
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,050
antisocial crime.

2541
01:13:14,051 --> 01:13:15,750
I'm a horrific crime and his choice lives.

2542
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:16,801
Um,

2543
01:13:16,801 --> 01:13:19,050
there's one video,

2544
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:21,000
a really video,

2545
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:21,960
which really made me sick,

2546
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:23,010
um,

2547
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:25,080
which was given to a
family of a kid of buck,

2548
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:28,950
a 14 year old kid who
was taken and they were,

2549
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:33,510
they send this video to his family in
Mexico and they were beating this kid and

2550
01:13:33,511 --> 01:13:34,350
saying to this kid,

2551
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:34,561
you know,

2552
01:13:34,561 --> 01:13:35,610
this is this,

2553
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,160
you in the go center camera.

2554
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:40,080
This is your fault bitch
to the mums is your fault.

2555
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:42,600
Look how your kids getting beaten now
you're going to give me the money.

2556
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:43,843
So I'll ask him for like,

2557
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:44,693
uh,

2558
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:47,310
was it $200,000 for time?

2559
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:48,660
Um,

2560
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:51,990
and those kinds of crimes and a kidnapping
doesn't happen in the United States

2561
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:56,250
on a very big level because you've
got effective law enforcement.

2562
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:58,013
So some,

2563
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:58,290
I mean,

2564
01:13:58,290 --> 01:13:58,580
our house,

2565
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,750
I was at one conference
and those are real nice,

2566
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:01,411
real nice guy,

2567
01:14:01,411 --> 01:14:03,900
but there's people calling
for the abolition of the
police and they shouldn't be

2568
01:14:03,901 --> 01:14:06,390
a police force saying
you really want to live.

2569
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:08,550
Like when no police,

2570
01:14:08,551 --> 01:14:11,040
you would only live with a dysfunctional
police when they can just kidnap your

2571
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:11,883
kid

2572
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:15,130
and like send a video to like that and
you've got no protection from that kind

2573
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:15,670
of thing.

2574
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:16,210
Right?

2575
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:16,720
I mean,

2576
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,800
there's definitely problems here,

2577
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:19,150
but also you've got to see the,

2578
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:19,381
the,

2579
01:14:19,381 --> 01:14:23,440
the other side of having completed
dysfunctional police force and what that

2580
01:14:23,441 --> 01:14:23,790
means.

2581
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:27,140
There's just such a staggering difference
between the United States and Mexico

2582
01:14:27,141 --> 01:14:29,540
in that regard in regard to gang violence,

2583
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:30,530
drug violence,

2584
01:14:30,531 --> 01:14:33,710
just overall murders and the
stories that we hear from over.

2585
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,760
It's so different.

2586
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:38,570
The fact that you could just
draw a little line in the dirt,

2587
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,070
he crossed that line.

2588
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:40,910
You're in hell.

2589
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:42,650
And then you cross this line.

2590
01:14:42,651 --> 01:14:43,484
You're in Houston.

2591
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:44,751
I mean,

2592
01:14:44,751 --> 01:14:46,280
that's fucking crazy.

2593
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:46,401
Yeah.

2594
01:14:46,401 --> 01:14:47,220
Yeah.

2595
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:47,661
I'm an a,

2596
01:14:47,661 --> 01:14:48,001
again,

2597
01:14:48,001 --> 01:14:48,834
I'm in,

2598
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:51,940
I'll get criticized
sometimes from a metro,

2599
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:56,000
sometimes Mesic Mexican government
sources or Mexican tourism sources.

2600
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:56,451
And I like,

2601
01:14:56,451 --> 01:14:57,540
I'm covering this stuff so,

2602
01:14:57,541 --> 01:14:58,700
and I'm shining the worst.

2603
01:14:59,660 --> 01:14:59,960
Um,

2604
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,110
and it can give it a story
picture sometime because you know,

2605
01:15:03,111 --> 01:15:07,040
when I tell a story of 49 decapitated
bodies with the hands and feet cut off,

2606
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:07,401
people think,

2607
01:15:07,401 --> 01:15:07,731
wow,

2608
01:15:07,731 --> 01:15:08,370
you know,

2609
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:09,460
as soon as you say this stuff,

2610
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:11,960
when some guy describing cap there
and people with this kind of does,

2611
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:13,453
um,

2612
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:13,721
you know,

2613
01:15:13,721 --> 01:15:14,620
if not people outside.

2614
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,570
And I don't say it was well as that
it is still is a great country.

2615
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,273
I still,

2616
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,100
you know,

2617
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,110
a lot of the United States.

2618
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:21,770
Um,

2619
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:22,080
but I,

2620
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,270
I probably love Mexico more.

2621
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,990
And what do you love more
about Mexico besides the food?

2622
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:28,290
Uh,

2623
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:28,611
I'm an,

2624
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:31,040
I would say generally
the atmosphere's good.

2625
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,890
I just feel uh,

2626
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:35,750
feel people are nice generally.

2627
01:15:35,751 --> 01:15:38,060
I think despite all of
this horrific violence,

2628
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:43,040
do you think it's because they don't
have the same sort of a ruthless ambition

2629
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,500
that people in the United States have?

2630
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,000
I think there is a sense,

2631
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:49,700
we were talking before about
why people are into drugs.

2632
01:15:49,701 --> 01:15:54,650
And one thing that occurred to me is
this kind of hyper competitiveness of

2633
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:55,484
society.

2634
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:58,460
And people can feel like failures.

2635
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:00,860
Like if you feel like a fairly,

2636
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:01,730
if you feel like,

2637
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:05,300
I guess maybe social media affected
this as well because you see what people

2638
01:16:05,301 --> 01:16:09,110
have and you expect you to have more
and you feel you haven't lived up to it.

2639
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:11,510
I think in Mexico people,

2640
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:13,790
if you're broken the United States,

2641
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:15,980
if when you come often maybe
feel like a personal failure,

2642
01:16:15,981 --> 01:16:17,840
how come you living in
America and you're broke,

2643
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:18,610
right?

2644
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:19,100
Um,

2645
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,100
whereas in Mexico lots of
people are broke so he like,

2646
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:21,420
you know,

2647
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:24,890
it's like you don't feel that same
kind of personal failure with that.

2648
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:26,520
When I'm there,

2649
01:16:26,521 --> 01:16:31,440
one thing that always strikes me is
how happy people seem and that I think

2650
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:35,850
there's a certain stress level that a lot
of Americans put themselves into where

2651
01:16:35,851 --> 01:16:40,851
they're constantly pursuing
material possessions and
material wealth and success

2652
01:16:41,371 --> 01:16:46,371
and that oftentimes this leads to really
exacerbated stress levels and it's not,

2653
01:16:47,461 --> 01:16:48,390
it doesn't make you happy.

2654
01:16:48,391 --> 01:16:52,380
Like the whole idea of having
things in our mind is a,

2655
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:54,690
someday if I buy this car,

2656
01:16:54,691 --> 01:16:55,471
I'll be happy.

2657
01:16:55,471 --> 01:16:56,940
If I live in this neighborhood,

2658
01:16:56,941 --> 01:16:57,751
I'll be happy.

2659
01:16:57,751 --> 01:16:58,081
And then,

2660
01:16:58,081 --> 01:17:01,530
so they work 12 hours a day to try to
achieve that dream and they're never

2661
01:17:01,531 --> 01:17:02,310
happy.

2662
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:03,690
And they're always stressed out.

2663
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:06,600
And even though the vast majority,

2664
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:07,590
the United States,

2665
01:17:07,591 --> 01:17:10,700
I mean there's some insane number 34,

2666
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,560
if you make one $35,000 a year,

2667
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,450
you were in the top 1% of the world.

2668
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:19,760
So there's a giant percentage of this
country that's in the top 1% of the world.

2669
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:22,580
Yet the overall happiness level,

2670
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:23,840
at least from what I've read,

2671
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:26,840
is quite a bit below the people in Mexico.

2672
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:28,100
Yay.

2673
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:28,390
I mean,

2674
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:28,820
yeah,

2675
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:29,511
a lot of these things.

2676
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:29,691
I mean,

2677
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:29,841
how,

2678
01:17:29,841 --> 01:17:29,990
yeah,

2679
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:32,850
how do you see you on happiness
will measure your own happiness,

2680
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:34,730
will sense if of successful failure?

2681
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:35,751
Uh,

2682
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:36,231
so yeah,

2683
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:37,730
so that's part of it.

2684
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:38,061
I mean,

2685
01:17:38,061 --> 01:17:38,894
uh,

2686
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,460
um,

2687
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:41,420
getting the food is great.

2688
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:42,030
The food is,

2689
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:44,420
the food at the food is my
giant fan of Mexican food.

2690
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:45,141
I love it.

2691
01:17:45,141 --> 01:17:46,150
There's a place down here that,

2692
01:17:46,151 --> 01:17:46,490
uh,

2693
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:48,140
I take the guys here that
work here all the time.

2694
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,480
It is as Mexican as you get.

2695
01:17:50,481 --> 01:17:51,860
No one speaks English there.

2696
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:56,840
They have a Mexican soap operas playing
on the television and the food is just

2697
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:58,010
sensational.

2698
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,240
It's so good.

2699
01:17:59,720 --> 01:17:59,961
Yeah.

2700
01:17:59,961 --> 01:18:00,410
Yeah.

2701
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:00,711
So,

2702
01:18:00,711 --> 01:18:01,400
um,

2703
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:01,650
so,

2704
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:03,020
so some of these things as well as that,

2705
01:18:03,021 --> 01:18:03,261
but,

2706
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:06,380
but before you took him out this
border between Mexico and the u s yeah,

2707
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:06,561
it's,

2708
01:18:06,561 --> 01:18:07,460
it's a huge,

2709
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:08,660
um,

2710
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:13,630
is that vast difference between
countries and cultures and I,

2711
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,511
and the interaction,

2712
01:18:14,511 --> 01:18:17,210
another issue I guess is the
issue of guns going south.

2713
01:18:17,211 --> 01:18:18,770
And we talked about lot
other crops come up.

2714
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:20,690
It was a god of firearms,

2715
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:21,620
a lot of firearms.

2716
01:18:21,621 --> 01:18:23,570
Like that fast and furious deal.

2717
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,210
Yeah.

2718
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:29,000
Well the Eric Holder thing that went down
years ago where they sold it was some

2719
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:33,980
sort of a sting and they sold guns and
those guns wind up being used to kill

2720
01:18:33,981 --> 01:18:36,530
Americans and even
American police officers,

2721
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:37,281
ea show.

2722
01:18:37,281 --> 01:18:38,000
So that was,

2723
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,280
so the ATF or gone off this and this,

2724
01:18:40,281 --> 01:18:42,140
I mean the number of guns knows

2725
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:43,940
how many guns have gone down,

2726
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:46,290
but there was one study that,

2727
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:51,950
and it came to conclusion at about two
over 200,000 guns every year go from the

2728
01:18:51,951 --> 01:18:53,000
United States into Mexico.

2729
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:55,543
So,

2730
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:56,830
so that,

2731
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:57,730
that isn't it.

2732
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:59,110
That's an insane number.

2733
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:00,240
200,000 guns.

2734
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:04,080
And I interviewed a guy in prison in
set up wireless for gun trafficking,

2735
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:09,890
and he would drive every weekend
from Mexico to the United States,

2736
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:11,910
um,

2737
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:14,730
by like 10 to 15,

2738
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:15,930
um,

2739
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:18,060
mostly our fifteens
some other guns as well,

2740
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:20,280
and drive them down into,

2741
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:21,270
into Mexico.

2742
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:23,040
And it's pretty easy to get into Mexico.

2743
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:24,300
So you drive them in.

2744
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:24,780
It's like,

2745
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:24,941
it's,

2746
01:19:24,941 --> 01:19:25,160
it's,

2747
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:25,993
it's,

2748
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:26,520
uh,

2749
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,530
a piece of Piss is very easy.

2750
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:29,251
You basically,

2751
01:19:29,251 --> 01:19:30,390
most of the time you've got no control.

2752
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:35,391
Now he would actually hide them in fridges
and in stoves and would pay an import

2753
01:19:37,711 --> 01:19:39,030
tax for the fridges and stoves.

2754
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:39,990
Mm.

2755
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:40,650
But,

2756
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,480
but he was buying them and he said,

2757
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:42,981
shit themselves.

2758
01:19:42,981 --> 01:19:44,130
And how did you buy the guns?

2759
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,053
He said,

2760
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,700
I would no idea to say what idea
did you showed to by your guns?

2761
01:19:47,701 --> 01:19:47,911
He said,

2762
01:19:47,911 --> 01:19:48,744
or nothing at all,

2763
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,190
said no idea whatsoever.

2764
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:50,441
So no,

2765
01:19:50,441 --> 01:19:50,511
no,

2766
01:19:50,511 --> 01:19:51,344
nothing at all.

2767
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,680
So did buy them from gun shows,

2768
01:19:52,681 --> 01:19:53,850
see buy from gun shows.

2769
01:19:53,851 --> 01:19:57,450
But then what he would do was he
was used the private sale loophole,

2770
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,400
which they're trying to close now.

2771
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,500
So he would go in there.

2772
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,020
And then I went to the
guns to a gun show in,

2773
01:20:04,021 --> 01:20:04,950
in Mesquite,

2774
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:07,020
in the Greater Dallas area,

2775
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,790
known as the gun show captain of America,

2776
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:13,650
and went to Gunshow there ad asked people,

2777
01:20:13,651 --> 01:20:15,090
can you sell me guns in our,

2778
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,021
I've done live here.

2779
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:16,854
Can you tell me guns?

2780
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,050
And first I said,

2781
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:19,281
oh no,

2782
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:20,114
you need to be tasteless.

2783
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:20,561
And someone said,

2784
01:20:20,561 --> 01:20:20,791
Oh yeah,

2785
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:21,001
sure.

2786
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:21,834
Consider these guns.

2787
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:22,740
And it was,

2788
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:25,170
the reason to get out is
they say it's a private sale.

2789
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:26,663
However,

2790
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:27,833
some of them,

2791
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:29,140
and I know some of the,

2792
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:29,501
the,

2793
01:20:29,501 --> 01:20:32,280
the pro gun people get
angry talking about this,

2794
01:20:32,281 --> 01:20:33,960
but I saw this with my own eyes.

2795
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:37,680
They've got a whole bunch of boxed up
EOF 15 rifles and they're sending them as

2796
01:20:37,681 --> 01:20:38,560
being private status.

2797
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:39,210
So yeah,

2798
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:41,500
private sale now he,

2799
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:44,160
so he was just to simply buying
these guns and taking them down.

2800
01:20:44,161 --> 01:20:45,810
I saw right in front of me as well.

2801
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:47,190
Somebody who,

2802
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:47,491
who,

2803
01:20:47,491 --> 01:20:47,910
who,

2804
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:49,680
who said to the person,

2805
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:50,130
I can't,

2806
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:51,120
I can't buy it,

2807
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:52,560
was looking for different gun and said,

2808
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:53,191
no,

2809
01:20:53,191 --> 01:20:54,130
I can't buy it.

2810
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:55,550
I don't have,

2811
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,030
I can't use it to buy the gun.

2812
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:57,940
Um,

2813
01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,010
and the person will,

2814
01:20:59,011 --> 01:20:59,281
you know,

2815
01:20:59,281 --> 01:20:59,971
still happy.

2816
01:20:59,971 --> 01:21:01,880
Like even the private
sale loophole if the,

2817
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:02,490
if you,

2818
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:03,360
in theory,

2819
01:21:03,361 --> 01:21:07,080
if you suspect the person is a criminal
or we use them for criminal purposes,

2820
01:21:07,081 --> 01:21:08,220
you shouldn't sell him the gun,

2821
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:09,960
but they don't care.

2822
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:12,090
And so one thing,

2823
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:12,421
I mean,

2824
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:13,890
you really want to,

2825
01:21:13,891 --> 01:21:15,210
people really want people who they could,

2826
01:21:15,211 --> 01:21:17,100
it could be ms 13 undocumented.

2827
01:21:17,101 --> 01:21:20,040
They can still walk in and buy
guns and some of these places.

2828
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:21,210
Um,

2829
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:21,720
but then,

2830
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,553
yeah.

2831
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:23,611
Um,

2832
01:21:23,611 --> 01:21:23,901
so that's,

2833
01:21:23,901 --> 01:21:24,131
that's a,

2834
01:21:24,131 --> 01:21:25,230
that's a big issue as well.

2835
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:25,641
Yeah.

2836
01:21:25,641 --> 01:21:27,230
Those gun shows are pretty bizarre.

2837
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:27,740
Yeah.

2838
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:30,980
You're walking around with a bunch of
people just itching to shoot somebody.

2839
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,510
They're just hoping somebody
breaks in their house.

2840
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:38,600
I know a guy who keeps a gun
and his ankle at all times.

2841
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:40,010
He keeps one in his back.

2842
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:41,240
He's got a,

2843
01:21:41,241 --> 01:21:42,920
he's got a holster that
he carries with him.

2844
01:21:42,921 --> 01:21:45,110
Sometimes he carries a
knife is what I mean.

2845
01:21:45,111 --> 01:21:47,480
He's literally begging for
someone to fuck with them.

2846
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:48,703
Mm.

2847
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:51,430
I've got no problem with
the people who like,

2848
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:52,293
uh,

2849
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:52,830
and I,

2850
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:55,180
I talked to a guy from the
Alaska machine gun association.

2851
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:58,103
He had,

2852
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:02,020
he has about 200 guns in his basement.

2853
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:02,883
200 guns.

2854
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:03,800
Wow.

2855
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:06,730
And I'd have a problem with,

2856
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:07,090
with,

2857
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:07,291
uh,

2858
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:08,590
with people with doing that,

2859
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:09,670
but then there's still like,

2860
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:13,240
how do you stop the Gun's
going to criminals the same,

2861
01:22:13,241 --> 01:22:13,570
the gun,

2862
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:14,750
the criminals in Baltimore.

2863
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:15,620
Um,

2864
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:18,050
I also interviewed in Baltimore
or gun trafficker who,

2865
01:22:18,051 --> 01:22:19,690
who's taken guns into
the city of Baltimore.

2866
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:20,360
The,

2867
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:20,631
yeah,

2868
01:22:20,631 --> 01:22:23,300
the gun show loophole is very strange.

2869
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:24,163
It's very strange.

2870
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:24,891
That's allowed.

2871
01:22:24,891 --> 01:22:26,120
And this is coming from someone,

2872
01:22:26,121 --> 01:22:30,060
me personally who owns guns and I believe
in the second amendment and I just,

2873
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:35,060
I don't think that the way to stop people
from doing illegal activities is to

2874
01:22:35,061 --> 01:22:38,510
make those activities illegal for
people who don't do anything illegal.

2875
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:39,230
You know,

2876
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:39,711
I think they're,

2877
01:22:39,711 --> 01:22:43,070
the real issue is the psychology behind
people that are willing to shoot people

2878
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:46,640
in the first place and the deal with the
overall mentality of these human beings

2879
01:22:46,641 --> 01:22:49,520
and try to figure out what's
wrong with our society.

2880
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,590
Curate at a base level,

2881
01:22:51,591 --> 01:22:51,741
at a,

2882
01:22:51,741 --> 01:22:52,820
at a human level,

2883
01:22:52,821 --> 01:22:53,810
that's what's really wrong.

2884
01:22:53,811 --> 01:22:55,460
It's not the inanimate object of a gun.

2885
01:22:55,461 --> 01:22:59,060
That's the problem is the human beings
that are willing to use these guns to

2886
01:22:59,061 --> 01:23:00,260
commit horrific acts.

2887
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:01,341
That's what I think.

2888
01:23:01,341 --> 01:23:04,580
But when you have something
like drug cartels,

2889
01:23:04,581 --> 01:23:06,040
which or gangs

2890
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,701
which exists,

2891
01:23:06,701 --> 01:23:10,630
and then you have this thing called a
gun show and then you have this gun show

2892
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:11,111
loophole,

2893
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,780
well boy you got a fucking
giant hole in your damn.

2894
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:15,730
You know you got water
pouring right through,

2895
01:23:15,731 --> 01:23:15,941
right?

2896
01:23:15,941 --> 01:23:16,331
They're like,

2897
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:17,290
how do you not fix that up?

2898
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:20,440
If you are a person who
believes in second amendment,

2899
01:23:20,441 --> 01:23:22,960
you believe in legal
and responsible gun use,

2900
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:26,050
you should be angry at that because that,

2901
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:28,120
that represents a gigantic problem.

2902
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:30,910
And that also represents a
threat to legal gun ownership.

2903
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:34,930
Because if this keeps happening and
people keep getting outreach and more mass

2904
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:38,050
shootings happen with illegally
acquired guns after a while,

2905
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:38,800
you know there's,

2906
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,250
there's,

2907
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:41,230
it's going to come to some sort of a,

2908
01:23:41,231 --> 01:23:42,850
a real conflict with people.

2909
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:43,240
Yeah.

2910
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,460
I'm actually doing a new
book about gun trafficking.

2911
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:46,600
Um,

2912
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,210
so I'm really interested to hear about
his issues and on what the actual room

2913
01:23:49,211 --> 01:23:50,890
for compromise is all log.

2914
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:55,240
We know someone like yourself who
believes in the second amendment.

2915
01:23:55,690 --> 01:23:59,230
How much room for compromise do you
think there is in on these issues?

2916
01:23:59,231 --> 01:24:01,720
I may like closing the gun show loophole.

2917
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:02,830
The other thing,

2918
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:03,521
like for example,

2919
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:04,630
the issue of 50 cals.

2920
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:05,830
Yeah.

2921
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:07,870
Laugh 50 cows in Mexico,

2922
01:24:07,871 --> 01:24:08,500
the cartels,

2923
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:08,861
cartels,

2924
01:24:08,861 --> 01:24:09,694
he's 50 cows.

2925
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,100
They used them to set up ambushes.

2926
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:14,770
They'll use it to hit a military vehicles,

2927
01:24:14,771 --> 01:24:15,604
please vehicles.

2928
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:16,591
So they're,

2929
01:24:16,591 --> 01:24:19,810
they're the seller side of a mountain and
there are 50 cows and go back and bang

2930
01:24:19,811 --> 01:24:20,840
and I go right through it.

2931
01:24:20,841 --> 01:24:22,510
They're like baseball size bullets.

2932
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:23,680
It's crazy now.

2933
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:24,300
Massive.

2934
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:24,960
Quite that big.

2935
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,640
But they're big ass bullets now.

2936
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:27,081
Yeah.

2937
01:24:27,081 --> 01:24:29,030
And I don't understand that a
lot of these myths completion,

2938
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:30,100
military are corrupt as well.

2939
01:24:30,101 --> 01:24:30,551
But you know,

2940
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:32,560
if you are an honest one or whatever,

2941
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:33,171
you're going in a,

2942
01:24:33,171 --> 01:24:35,000
in a car and he's fucking
hit by one of those guns.

2943
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:35,913
Your vehicle,

2944
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:37,150
the now open up on you.

2945
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:39,730
So is there any room there
do you think for like,

2946
01:24:39,731 --> 01:24:40,564
um,

2947
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,280
clamp down on 50 cows?

2948
01:24:42,281 --> 01:24:43,690
I've never heard that
discussion that much.

2949
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,420
I have a friend who was
one and see Anthony Kumina.

2950
01:24:46,430 --> 01:24:47,530
He's got a 50 caliber.

2951
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:49,090
It's ridiculous.

2952
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:49,930
It's crazy.

2953
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:51,850
I mean the idea that you're
using that for self defense,

2954
01:24:51,851 --> 01:24:54,670
unless you're going to war
with Russia or you know,

2955
01:24:54,671 --> 01:24:57,640
fighting against some gang cartel gang,

2956
01:24:57,641 --> 01:24:59,080
that's a invading your city.

2957
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:02,140
That seems that's a military weapon.

2958
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:04,770
I mean it's the same
argument I think for uh,

2959
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:05,643
having a,

2960
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:07,720
a fighter jet with Hellfire missiles.

2961
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:11,650
Do I think you should be able to own
a Cessna and fly a little prep playing

2962
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:11,980
around?

2963
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:12,550
Sure.

2964
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:13,300
Okay.

2965
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,460
Do I think you should
be able to own a jet?

2966
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:16,750
Well,

2967
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:19,030
I mean there are a lot of
rich folks with private jets.

2968
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:19,870
Okay.

2969
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:23,710
Do I think you should be able to own a
fighter jet that goes the speed of sound

2970
01:25:23,711 --> 01:25:24,100
or,

2971
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:24,730
oh,

2972
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:27,250
I mean it's just a faster jet,

2973
01:25:27,251 --> 01:25:27,580
right?

2974
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:27,820
Yeah.

2975
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:28,210
Okay.

2976
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:28,660
Okay.

2977
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:32,830
Do you think you should be able to
own a fighter jet with 50 caliber guns

2978
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:33,723
strapped to it?

2979
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:35,050
Oh,

2980
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:36,100
well what the fuck is that?

2981
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,330
Are you starting a war?

2982
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:38,350
Like what are you doing it?

2983
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:40,930
This is like these levels
that things get to,

2984
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:41,793
you know,

2985
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:42,520
um,

2986
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,301
that's this.

2987
01:25:43,301 --> 01:25:47,590
There's the argument against a t automatic
weapons or you can't use automatic,

2988
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:51,300
like certain states have regulations
in terms of what you can and you know,

2989
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:53,770
in California you can't
even have a silencer.

2990
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:54,963
Um,

2991
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:59,140
I don't know why because it's very
bad to have that loud bang of a gun.

2992
01:25:59,141 --> 01:26:00,520
It's terrible for your ears.

2993
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:02,160
And if you're a hunter or,

2994
01:26:02,161 --> 01:26:04,130
or someone who likes to
shoot target practice

2995
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:04,500
or something,

2996
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,410
that's a terrible thing for your ears.

2997
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:09,500
And there's a suppressor that get put on
the end of the barrel and will mitigate

2998
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:09,711
that.

2999
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:10,760
But for whatever reason,

3000
01:26:10,761 --> 01:26:14,150
I think mostly because of
films and public perception,

3001
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,720
people think that those silencers are
only used by assassins or something like

3002
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:17,980
that.

3003
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:19,430
Are you using to kill people?

3004
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:20,291
So do they,

3005
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:20,631
they get it.

3006
01:26:20,631 --> 01:26:21,311
They convert the,

3007
01:26:21,311 --> 01:26:23,330
the semiautomatics from
the states in Mexico,

3008
01:26:23,331 --> 01:26:25,120
they convert the fully automatic yes

3009
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:26,611
here too.

3010
01:26:26,611 --> 01:26:27,091
And then of course,

3011
01:26:27,091 --> 01:26:28,320
you know about bump stocks,

3012
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,930
which makes it much more,

3013
01:26:30,931 --> 01:26:31,740
um,

3014
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:32,820
free with the trigger.

3015
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:33,301
I'm much,

3016
01:26:33,301 --> 01:26:35,130
much easier to fire rapidly rather.

3017
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,750
So how do you feel about the issue?

3018
01:26:36,751 --> 01:26:36,961
You know,

3019
01:26:36,961 --> 01:26:39,700
one of the issues is of having a,

3020
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:39,920
uh,

3021
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:44,920
a database like the ATF or they're not
allowed to have a searchable database on,

3022
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:49,290
on guns in the United States.

3023
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:50,400
So they have like,

3024
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:53,100
they have like paper files and stuff
they go through still and they can't have

3025
01:26:53,101 --> 01:26:55,590
like a digital database on guns.

3026
01:26:55,650 --> 01:26:56,550
That seems ridiculous,

3027
01:26:56,551 --> 01:26:57,090
doesn't it?

3028
01:26:57,090 --> 01:26:57,650
Yeah,

3029
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:59,130
I mean you think they think I'm a bit,

3030
01:26:59,180 --> 01:26:59,551
I guess the,

3031
01:26:59,551 --> 01:27:00,940
these are the gun lobby.

3032
01:27:00,941 --> 01:27:04,560
See the idea of a guy in a registry as
being a step to taking away their guns

3033
01:27:04,561 --> 01:27:06,330
because um,

3034
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:09,450
like once you start registering that
you can go then afterwards and say,

3035
01:27:09,451 --> 01:27:11,490
well we know where the
guns are or whatever,

3036
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:14,970
but how do you feel thing there's
flexibility on that issue of like the gun.

3037
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:17,130
I've liked having searchable databases.

3038
01:27:17,131 --> 01:27:17,881
I mean like with a car,

3039
01:27:17,881 --> 01:27:21,600
like you have a license plate and if
there's a hit and run you just type it in

3040
01:27:21,601 --> 01:27:25,710
and you know whose car it is within
seconds with gun tracing you can't,

3041
01:27:25,711 --> 01:27:25,861
you know,

3042
01:27:25,861 --> 01:27:27,420
you find a gun at a crime scene,

3043
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:28,081
whatever.

3044
01:27:28,081 --> 01:27:29,490
You can't just trade
it in or put a button,

3045
01:27:29,491 --> 01:27:30,324
your Guy Bang.

3046
01:27:30,330 --> 01:27:31,320
That is,

3047
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:32,820
they have to go through paper.

3048
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:36,420
I have to go through a whole formal
trace and go through this kind of search.

3049
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,110
She then there's flexibility
on that issue as well or,

3050
01:27:39,111 --> 01:27:40,650
or how do you feel about that yourself?

3051
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:40,991
Well,

3052
01:27:40,991 --> 01:27:41,970
I've myself field,

3053
01:27:41,971 --> 01:27:43,690
there should be a traceable database.

3054
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:49,210
I mean if it's just like a car and a
glad you brought up that analogy because

3055
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:50,470
when you,

3056
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:52,510
when you get a car,

3057
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:54,580
you have to know how to drive a car.

3058
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:55,480
You have to,

3059
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:57,580
in order to have a license to drive a car,

3060
01:27:57,581 --> 01:27:59,560
you have to take a test,

3061
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:03,370
you have to take a written test and you
have to take a physical driving test

3062
01:28:03,371 --> 01:28:04,210
with an instructor.

3063
01:28:04,211 --> 01:28:08,590
They have to see and think about how many
more people drive cars then own guns.

3064
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:12,040
So it's possible to do this
with guns yet it's not done.

3065
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,390
When I bought my first gun,

3066
01:28:13,391 --> 01:28:13,571
they're like,

3067
01:28:13,571 --> 01:28:14,404
here you go.

3068
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:15,363
It's like what?

3069
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:16,323
Like that's it.

3070
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:16,781
Like yeah,

3071
01:28:16,781 --> 01:28:17,614
you're not a criminal.

3072
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:17,921
Look,

3073
01:28:17,921 --> 01:28:19,210
we did a check check on you.

3074
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:19,901
You're not a criminal.

3075
01:28:19,901 --> 01:28:20,650
Here's a gun.

3076
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:23,290
And I bought a pistol about a 38 revolver.

3077
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:24,250
That was my first gun.

3078
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:29,650
And I went to the gun range and practice
with the gun and I read about how to do

3079
01:28:29,651 --> 01:28:34,651
it and I talked to an instructor about
safety and put goggles on and ear muffs

3080
01:28:34,961 --> 01:28:35,411
and you know,

3081
01:28:35,411 --> 01:28:38,950
make sure you're protected and how to
properly hold the gun while you shoot it

3082
01:28:38,951 --> 01:28:39,910
and all these different things.

3083
01:28:39,911 --> 01:28:42,850
But it's stunning to me that
you don't have to do that.

3084
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:43,601
I mean,

3085
01:28:43,601 --> 01:28:48,601
you can own 150 guns and
know how to operate zero of
them and they're all yours.

3086
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:50,410
You,

3087
01:28:50,410 --> 01:28:51,400
you don't even have to prove,

3088
01:28:51,401 --> 01:28:51,671
you know,

3089
01:28:51,671 --> 01:28:53,050
what the fuck then safety is.

3090
01:28:53,051 --> 01:28:53,681
You don't have to prove,

3091
01:28:53,681 --> 01:28:53,921
you know,

3092
01:28:53,921 --> 01:28:54,754
anything that's,

3093
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:55,863
that's crazy.

3094
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:56,631
But not me.

3095
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:57,630
It's fun to shoot guns.

3096
01:28:57,631 --> 01:28:58,250
I'm not a,

3097
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,890
since I've been doing research with
new pickup and shooting a few guns in

3098
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:01,231
places,

3099
01:29:01,231 --> 01:29:02,070
I wa I went

3100
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,940
over to Serbia and arrived
in Serbia on a hangover.

3101
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:09,960
I'd see my friends in the UK and got
drunk with them and arrived in a hangover

3102
01:29:09,961 --> 01:29:10,794
and I'd met,

3103
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:11,111
uh,

3104
01:29:11,111 --> 01:29:11,944
the contact dancer.

3105
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:15,660
I wanted to go to a gun club and
he took me into a nuclear bunker.

3106
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:19,390
And Find Ak 47 just came off the plane.

3107
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:20,541
Wow.

3108
01:29:20,541 --> 01:29:20,820
Me.

3109
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:21,520
And it was like,

3110
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:21,770
wow.

3111
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:22,780
They had a crazy,

3112
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:22,981
I said,

3113
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:26,400
whatever you want to fight at a crazy
amount of guns there so I can see it's,

3114
01:29:26,401 --> 01:29:26,591
it's,

3115
01:29:26,591 --> 01:29:27,990
it's fun to fire these things.

3116
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,630
Do you think they actually
are good in self defense?

3117
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:30,801
I mean,

3118
01:29:30,801 --> 01:29:30,980
do you,

3119
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:31,741
do you actually think,

3120
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:31,981
I mean,

3121
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:32,960
I don't know.

3122
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:33,541
It makes go.

3123
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:34,500
I don't have guns.

3124
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:34,820
Um,

3125
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:35,110
I don't,

3126
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:35,943
I wouldn't,

3127
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:38,190
when I travel in the field,

3128
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:38,790
um,

3129
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,370
I won't go security.

3130
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:40,750
Um,

3131
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:45,420
they'd generally security is going to
be more of a hindrance because they're

3132
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:46,254
attracted attention.

3133
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:46,471
Yeah.

3134
01:29:46,471 --> 01:29:49,530
Tried to attention and you've got to go
basically what my hands up and send it.

3135
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:49,861
This is it.

3136
01:29:49,861 --> 01:29:50,221
This is me.

3137
01:29:50,221 --> 01:29:51,054
It's what I'm doing.

3138
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:53,040
And most of the situations there,

3139
01:29:53,041 --> 01:29:54,720
you've got to have a lot
of people with heavy guns.

3140
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:55,441
You're not going to our gun.

3141
01:29:55,441 --> 01:29:55,970
These guys.

3142
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:56,803
Yes.

3143
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:59,490
In Central America was a
bit different in Honduras.

3144
01:29:59,600 --> 01:29:59,860
They were,

3145
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:00,840
I was with guys with guns.

3146
01:30:00,841 --> 01:30:03,210
They're not out of choice,

3147
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:03,471
uh,

3148
01:30:03,471 --> 01:30:03,600
of,

3149
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,050
of choosing security because the,

3150
01:30:05,051 --> 01:30:05,201
the,

3151
01:30:05,201 --> 01:30:07,260
the journey's himself was Karen a gun.

3152
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,470
And had friends carrying
guns and he was in,

3153
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:12,320
he was carrying a mini UC
was driving his journey.

3154
01:30:12,321 --> 01:30:14,520
His friend of mine or Lean
Castro's name is Greg,

3155
01:30:14,521 --> 01:30:15,354
Greg Ernest.

3156
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:18,200
He was driving around
and he had a mini UC,

3157
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:19,723
um,

3158
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:20,140
on,

3159
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:23,970
on his lap as he was driving around to
crime scenes and running around doing

3160
01:30:23,971 --> 01:30:24,804
stuff.

3161
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:25,993
Um,

3162
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:26,881
but do you,

3163
01:30:26,881 --> 01:30:29,790
do you think guns are actually
effective for self defense?

3164
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:29,971
I mean,

3165
01:30:29,971 --> 01:30:31,860
do you have guns for self
defense and believe in that?

3166
01:30:31,861 --> 01:30:33,840
I would simply just enjoy
the sport of shooting guns.

3167
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:34,231
Well,

3168
01:30:34,231 --> 01:30:35,310
I hunt in,

3169
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:35,910
uh,

3170
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:37,770
one of the things I have used,

3171
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:39,120
although I archery hunt.

3172
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:40,230
Now most of the,

3173
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,790
most of the hunts I go on when I,

3174
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,740
when I go to these places to uh,

3175
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:47,370
to bow hunt specifically.

3176
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:48,720
Um,

3177
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,310
but I have rifles for hunting.

3178
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:51,160
Um,

3179
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:56,160
I have hand guns for self defense in
it depends entirely on the situation.

3180
01:30:56,671 --> 01:30:57,211
That's like saying,

3181
01:30:57,211 --> 01:30:59,850
do you think cars are effective
to get you where you want to go?

3182
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:00,541
Well,

3183
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:01,410
they are effective.

3184
01:31:01,411 --> 01:31:03,570
If you drive carefully and you,

3185
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:03,901
you know,

3186
01:31:03,901 --> 01:31:07,350
use the blinkers and look when
you change lanes and you know,

3187
01:31:07,351 --> 01:31:11,760
make sure you observe the speed limit
and all the different laws and are aware

3188
01:31:11,761 --> 01:31:13,020
and don't crash in anybody.

3189
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:14,280
But if you're an asshole,

3190
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:14,810
no,

3191
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:15,570
they are not effective.

3192
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:17,250
You're going to wind up
dying in a car accident.

3193
01:31:17,251 --> 01:31:19,050
You're going to flip your car
over in the side of the road.

3194
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:19,980
Um,

3195
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:21,630
if you're in a terrible situation,

3196
01:31:21,631 --> 01:31:25,020
it is better to have a gun then and not
have a gun if you know how to use it,

3197
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,820
if someone's breaking into your house.

3198
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:27,683
There has been,

3199
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:32,580
there's countless stories of people
protecting their families from,

3200
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,160
from bad guys when they have guns.

3201
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:35,610
They,

3202
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:36,720
these are real stories.

3203
01:31:36,721 --> 01:31:37,531
They do exist.

3204
01:31:37,531 --> 01:31:38,820
There are people that I've talked to,

3205
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:39,451
they,

3206
01:31:39,451 --> 01:31:40,860
you mean you can find them.

3207
01:31:40,861 --> 01:31:42,390
There's countless stories.

3208
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,090
There's also countless stories
of people leaving their guns,

3209
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:45,811
uh,

3210
01:31:45,811 --> 01:31:47,000
unlocked and a child,

3211
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,350
a child gets a hold of it and
kills himself accidentally.

3212
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:49,981
There's,

3213
01:31:49,981 --> 01:31:52,710
there's stories of children
accidentally killing their mothers.

3214
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:53,370
There's,

3215
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:54,720
there's all those stories too.

3216
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:56,150
So Ken,

3217
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:59,440
a gun be effective in
self defense for sure.

3218
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:00,070
That's why

3219
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,030
the military used them.

3220
01:32:01,031 --> 01:32:02,560
That's why police officers use them.

3221
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:07,740
That's why people train and they go to
the range and they take tactical courses

3222
01:32:07,991 --> 01:32:10,420
to learn how to use a
gun for self defense.

3223
01:32:10,421 --> 01:32:11,021
Absolutely.

3224
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:12,640
A gun can be used for self defense.

3225
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:16,270
It's the best thing for the
best tool for self defense.

3226
01:32:16,271 --> 01:32:16,960
Other than,

3227
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:17,250
you know,

3228
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:19,180
obviously living in a good neighborhood,

3229
01:32:19,181 --> 01:32:20,014
having a uh,

3230
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:20,490
uh,

3231
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:21,280
uh,

3232
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,240
security alarm,

3233
01:32:22,241 --> 01:32:23,200
all these different steps.

3234
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:24,880
A dog dogs are good,

3235
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,800
especially at dogs as a trained dog.

3236
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,060
But yeah,

3237
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:30,820
guns absolutely can protect you.

3238
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:31,810
If you're in a situation,

3239
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:33,940
someone breaks in your house
and you shoot that person dead,

3240
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:35,171
that's you.

3241
01:32:35,171 --> 01:32:37,660
You're safer then that person killing you.

3242
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:38,980
That has happened.

3243
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:40,770
But it's a decision that me,

3244
01:32:40,771 --> 01:32:42,220
this is a gross generalization.

3245
01:32:42,221 --> 01:32:45,610
That's an entirely dependent upon the
situation that you find yourself in.

3246
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,380
But if you're not,

3247
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:50,620
if you're not protected by,

3248
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:50,830
uh,

3249
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:51,301
if you,

3250
01:32:51,301 --> 01:32:53,260
if you don't understand how to use it,

3251
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:54,580
if you're not trained,

3252
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:55,683
if you don't,

3253
01:32:56,110 --> 01:33:00,610
if you don't have training to keep your
shit together when things go south.

3254
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:05,140
Because when you're in a situation
and your life is in danger,

3255
01:33:05,141 --> 01:33:07,720
if you've never been in a high
pressure situation before,

3256
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:12,130
how do you know you can keep it together
and even hit something you're aiming

3257
01:33:12,131 --> 01:33:12,520
at?

3258
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:17,520
People have wild trigger panic and they
have a really hard time dealing with

3259
01:33:18,011 --> 01:33:21,040
life or death situations if they haven't
served in the military or have been

3260
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:21,791
some very,

3261
01:33:21,791 --> 01:33:23,200
very high stress situations.

3262
01:33:23,201 --> 01:33:27,400
We have to learn how to control yourself
under extreme pressure conditions.

3263
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:28,481
There's a lot,

3264
01:33:28,481 --> 01:33:30,310
there's a lot of factors there.

3265
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:32,690
But I would say the
same thing as like you,

3266
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:34,810
you would also say that with martial arts.

3267
01:33:34,811 --> 01:33:37,810
Like can you defend yourself
if you know martial arts?

3268
01:33:37,811 --> 01:33:38,644
Well,

3269
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:40,090
depends on what you know.

3270
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:43,070
I mean some martial arts
or fucking horseshit you,

3271
01:33:43,071 --> 01:33:43,310
you,

3272
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:43,630
you,

3273
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:45,820
there's a lot of people out
there practicing nonsense.

3274
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,060
And if someone who actually knew how
to fight just punched him in the face,

3275
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:50,200
they would be doomed.

3276
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:54,880
And then there's other people out there
that are experts that would be very calm

3277
01:33:54,881 --> 01:33:58,150
if someone tried to fight them and they
would know what to do and what not to

3278
01:33:58,151 --> 01:33:58,301
do.

3279
01:33:58,301 --> 01:33:59,490
And if the person wasn't armed,

3280
01:33:59,491 --> 01:34:01,060
they would be able to
easily dispatch them.

3281
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:03,550
It really is dependent upon the situation,

3282
01:34:03,551 --> 01:34:04,930
how much effort you've put into it,

3283
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:06,460
how much thought you've put into it.

3284
01:34:06,461 --> 01:34:06,611
And,

3285
01:34:06,611 --> 01:34:10,990
but there is a lot of people out there
that if you broke into their house,

3286
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:15,160
you're making a huge mistake because
they are trained and prepared and ready

3287
01:34:15,161 --> 01:34:16,480
because they don't want to be a victim.

3288
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:18,520
And it doesn't mean they're bad people.

3289
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:19,501
And I think we,

3290
01:34:19,501 --> 01:34:22,270
we have a problem in this
country where we look at things.

3291
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:23,680
They're very binary there.

3292
01:34:23,681 --> 01:34:24,820
One or zero there,

3293
01:34:24,821 --> 01:34:25,600
good or bad.

3294
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:26,433
Guns are bad.

3295
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:27,281
Guns are always bad.

3296
01:34:27,281 --> 01:34:28,350
I don't want to go on God.

3297
01:34:28,351 --> 01:34:29,830
God put bad guys.

3298
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:30,940
Take your gun sometimes.

3299
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:31,481
Sure.

3300
01:34:31,481 --> 01:34:32,230
Sometimes,

3301
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:34,870
sometimes you kill the bad guy and
you protect your family though too.

3302
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,733
That's real too.

3303
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:36,131
Yeah,

3304
01:34:36,131 --> 01:34:36,311
no,

3305
01:34:36,311 --> 01:34:37,360
I have respect for people having,

3306
01:34:37,361 --> 01:34:38,590
having guns for self defense.

3307
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:40,660
We were talking about that shooting.

3308
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:44,790
I've been around a few shootouts
in Latin America and uh,

3309
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,633
and over in Haiti.

3310
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:47,560
And one thing about that from,

3311
01:34:47,561 --> 01:34:49,420
from a journalist point
of view and being around,

3312
01:34:49,421 --> 01:34:51,220
and I've been seeing a
lot of violence as well,

3313
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:52,210
a lot people fighting.

3314
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:53,170
Um,

3315
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:54,580
even going back to England,

3316
01:34:54,581 --> 01:34:55,840
people having physical fights,

3317
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:56,900
um,

3318
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,400
or with knives and that kind of thing.

3319
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:02,270
So one of the differences
I think with guns is,

3320
01:35:03,070 --> 01:35:03,561
and it's funny,

3321
01:35:03,561 --> 01:35:05,750
you can't see bullets is as I said,

3322
01:35:05,751 --> 01:35:06,030
it's such a,

3323
01:35:06,030 --> 01:35:06,270
it's a,

3324
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:07,130
it's like a small thing,

3325
01:35:07,131 --> 01:35:10,820
but like you can't see the thing that's
hanging when you see a guy with a knife,

3326
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:11,330
right?

3327
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:12,680
It's like the guy's scary.

3328
01:35:12,681 --> 01:35:13,281
You can see,

3329
01:35:13,281 --> 01:35:15,230
you can imagine that
knife sticking into you,

3330
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,020
but the gun is like you were seeing,

3331
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:18,680
you know,

3332
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:19,221
the object,

3333
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:21,050
you can't see really that the polygamy in.

3334
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:22,700
So one of the Times,

3335
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:27,740
one of the Times I was in Haiti and I
went in to cover the earthquake in 2010,

3336
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:29,271
which was,

3337
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:29,511
you know,

3338
01:35:29,511 --> 01:35:30,051
real sad,

3339
01:35:30,051 --> 01:35:30,271
you know,

3340
01:35:30,271 --> 01:35:31,730
like crazy amount of debt day.

3341
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:34,910
And we were covering the looting,

3342
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:35,691
um,

3343
01:35:35,691 --> 01:35:40,691
afterwards and the police came and started
firing right into where people were

3344
01:35:43,941 --> 01:35:45,230
looting and was with a camera man.

3345
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:48,380
And the police were fine,

3346
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:48,771
Bang,

3347
01:35:48,771 --> 01:35:51,590
Bang and [inaudible] and it
drew in his same situation.

3348
01:35:51,591 --> 01:35:51,761
Not,

3349
01:35:51,761 --> 01:35:52,850
not right in that scene there,

3350
01:35:52,851 --> 01:35:55,880
but in another scene they
shot and killed somebody.

3351
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:59,390
The police just firing at the looters and
all the Lucas started running when the

3352
01:35:59,391 --> 01:36:00,171
police or fire,

3353
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:02,460
I note a foreign going with the,

3354
01:36:02,461 --> 01:36:04,220
how high were they firing
when they were firing,

3355
01:36:04,221 --> 01:36:04,670
you know,

3356
01:36:04,670 --> 01:36:05,061
Bang.

3357
01:36:05,061 --> 01:36:05,894
Finally split that.

3358
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:10,750
And a camera man I was
with was just sat down.

3359
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:11,990
He was like filming this.

3360
01:36:13,490 --> 01:36:15,500
And I think this is one of
the problems that wildlife,

3361
01:36:15,501 --> 01:36:17,390
cameraman get shot in these places.

3362
01:36:17,391 --> 01:36:19,190
You start feeling like
you're watching on TV.

3363
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:20,120
Oh Wow.

3364
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:20,953
Cause you feel like,

3365
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:21,260
you know,

3366
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,850
you're seeing the lasing loud is amazing.

3367
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:26,990
Look or look at what I'm watching
and you're seeing this and this.

3368
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:28,070
Let not saying run,

3369
01:36:28,071 --> 01:36:29,100
we've got to go like the fire.

3370
01:36:29,101 --> 01:36:29,934
And he was like,

3371
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:30,580
was like,

3372
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:32,090
it's like we got to get the shot.

3373
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:34,453
We got a go.

3374
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:35,270
Ah,

3375
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:35,721
there's a,

3376
01:36:35,721 --> 01:36:37,310
there's another sad,

3377
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:39,611
sad thing of a,

3378
01:36:39,611 --> 01:36:40,041
of a,

3379
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:41,900
of a guy filming,

3380
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:42,540
uh,

3381
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:46,060
American journalist called
Bradley wrote and will,

3382
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:46,710
uh,

3383
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:49,970
in a rest in peace who was
killed in Mexico back in 2006.

3384
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:56,110
And he was filming a shooting in state
of war Hakka and he filmed these guys

3385
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:02,030
shooting and he fell and was
hit and it carried on filming.

3386
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:03,290
Oh Wow.

3387
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:04,280
He filmed his own death.

3388
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:04,581
I mean,

3389
01:37:04,581 --> 01:37:05,810
you can literally see there.

3390
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,393
Um,

3391
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:08,090
yeah.

3392
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:09,470
Sad has worked for news agency when that,

3393
01:37:09,471 --> 01:37:10,310
that day when he was,

3394
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:11,413
when he was killed in,

3395
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:12,651
yeah.

3396
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:15,830
There's a lot of courageous
camera people and you know,

3397
01:37:15,831 --> 01:37:18,680
they get locked into that job
and it becomes normalized.

3398
01:37:18,681 --> 01:37:19,700
Almost like you were saying,

3399
01:37:19,701 --> 01:37:22,460
the people that live in
these war torn areas,

3400
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:24,920
it becomes a normal way of
life to them and all their,

3401
01:37:24,921 --> 01:37:26,090
there are a lot of murders.

3402
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:28,190
If you're there on a daily basis,

3403
01:37:28,191 --> 01:37:30,080
it seems like almost like a regular life.

3404
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:31,730
A lot of these cameramen,

3405
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:33,560
I mean they're courageous people.

3406
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:37,310
You see these guys who go over to
war zones and film what's going on in

3407
01:37:37,311 --> 01:37:38,690
Afghanistan and you know,

3408
01:37:38,691 --> 01:37:40,010
and I've met some of these guys,

3409
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,273
there's just,

3410
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:45,500
it's a crazy way of life to just accept
the fact that you're an observer that

3411
01:37:45,501 --> 01:37:48,410
might be a victim and
you're capturing all this.

3412
01:37:48,411 --> 01:37:49,610
So people like me can get,

3413
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:50,150
uh,

3414
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:54,200
some semblance of a perception to what's
going on in that part of the world.

3415
01:37:54,790 --> 01:37:55,760
I went to the Philippines,

3416
01:37:55,761 --> 01:37:59,400
southern Philippines and saw the
fight against the Islamic state there,

3417
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,033
uh,

3418
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:05,710
in end of 2017 and it was interesting
seeing that compared to the violence I

3419
01:38:05,711 --> 01:38:06,521
cover normally in,

3420
01:38:06,521 --> 01:38:07,170
in Mexico.

3421
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:08,910
So that was isis.

3422
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,700
They took over to city morale.

3423
01:38:10,701 --> 01:38:11,534
We,

3424
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,200
and it was an error.

3425
01:38:13,201 --> 01:38:13,701
They caught it.

3426
01:38:13,701 --> 01:38:14,190
It was,

3427
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:14,710
it was interesting,

3428
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:15,960
was more self contained.

3429
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:16,471
They had,

3430
01:38:16,471 --> 01:38:16,950
uh,

3431
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:18,630
an area called the main battle area,

3432
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:19,640
the MBA thing,

3433
01:38:19,641 --> 01:38:20,820
may main battle area.

3434
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:25,530
So in that area was isis
and the Philippine army just
done that at all the time.

3435
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,790
Just like constant bang,

3436
01:38:26,791 --> 01:38:27,061
Bang,

3437
01:38:27,061 --> 01:38:27,331
Bang,

3438
01:38:27,331 --> 01:38:27,601
Bang,

3439
01:38:27,601 --> 01:38:29,940
Bang and planes going over and bombing.

3440
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:31,351
But actually,

3441
01:38:31,351 --> 01:38:33,060
even when you're outside that main area,

3442
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:33,841
even if you're,

3443
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:33,991
you know,

3444
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:37,470
we were just outside it and even if
you're like 600 meters or 600 meters from

3445
01:38:37,471 --> 01:38:38,250
it,

3446
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:38,790
but it's,

3447
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:39,840
you're not in the fighting,

3448
01:38:39,841 --> 01:38:41,190
the fighting is over there.

3449
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,830
Whereas in something like Mexico,

3450
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,590
South America locked on this fighting
is kind of happening everywhere.

3451
01:38:46,591 --> 01:38:50,520
There's no real control over Wayne
where the main battle area is.

3452
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:51,741
But there,

3453
01:38:51,741 --> 01:38:54,600
they didn't really let
any journalists inside,

3454
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:58,050
like deep into the main battle there and
didn't really let any journalists in,

3455
01:38:58,051 --> 01:39:03,051
was sitting outside and hearing just
constant ricochet of gunfire and,

3456
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:05,880
but sometimes bullets
will come out of the area.

3457
01:39:05,881 --> 01:39:10,860
So there was an Australian guy and I
think he bent over to pick up some cookies

3458
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:13,200
and a bullet hit him in the neck.

3459
01:39:14,270 --> 01:39:14,740
Um,

3460
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:14,941
uh,

3461
01:39:14,941 --> 01:39:19,941
saw the x ray actually the bullet embedded
in the side of his neck and Nestle,

3462
01:39:20,551 --> 01:39:23,970
it takes taken out and he was so it
must've been at the end of its terminal

3463
01:39:23,971 --> 01:39:24,804
velocity.

3464
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:25,500
Yeah.

3465
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:25,861
Yeah.

3466
01:39:25,861 --> 01:39:27,090
So it must have been a far,

3467
01:39:27,091 --> 01:39:27,511
far,

3468
01:39:27,511 --> 01:39:28,380
far shot.

3469
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:29,240
Yeah,

3470
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:29,471
yeah,

3471
01:39:29,471 --> 01:39:29,611
yeah.

3472
01:39:29,611 --> 01:39:31,830
That went through something
else for it hit him.

3473
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:32,131
Yeah.

3474
01:39:32,131 --> 01:39:32,550
Yeah.

3475
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:32,880
Yeah.

3476
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:33,181
So,

3477
01:39:33,181 --> 01:39:33,720
so he,

3478
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:34,050
so yeah,

3479
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:36,680
maybe it didn't go into fast
though that crazy though.

3480
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:37,040
I didn't.

3481
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:37,180
Yeah,

3482
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:37,621
exactly.

3483
01:39:37,621 --> 01:39:38,560
So it was kind of a of beans.

3484
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:39,270
Okay.

3485
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:39,511
Yeah,

3486
01:39:39,511 --> 01:39:40,630
I think so.

3487
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:41,300
Kay.

3488
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:43,590
He was okay with it or that guy's lucky.

3489
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:44,220
Yeah.

3490
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:45,720
It's shot in the neck and you are okay.

3491
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:46,051
Yeah.

3492
01:39:46,051 --> 01:39:46,560
So,

3493
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:46,921
but,

3494
01:39:46,921 --> 01:39:47,190
um,

3495
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:47,641
but yeah,

3496
01:39:47,641 --> 01:39:48,170
in terms of,

3497
01:39:48,170 --> 01:39:48,350
you know,

3498
01:39:48,350 --> 01:39:50,070
some of the people
who've really been in a,

3499
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:51,390
um,

3500
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:51,661
there was,

3501
01:39:51,661 --> 01:39:51,861
they would,

3502
01:39:51,861 --> 01:39:52,320
they had a,

3503
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,153
one of the guys,

3504
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:54,063
um,

3505
01:39:54,090 --> 01:39:59,090
one of the police special force guys
had a camera on his helmet and he went,

3506
01:39:59,161 --> 01:40:01,740
he showed me that footage
and he was right there.

3507
01:40:01,741 --> 01:40:03,070
Right inside they're going,

3508
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,110
they're like really,

3509
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:07,500
really close buildings fighting
with Islamic isis people.

3510
01:40:08,310 --> 01:40:11,730
And it was the same techniques I talked
to the general and he had a big chart

3511
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:17,090
showing how the techniques of guerrilla
warfare had evolved from like Fallujah,

3512
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:18,563
Aleppo,

3513
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:19,763
Mosul,

3514
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:24,240
and how this kind of weird new form
of guerrilla warfare they have of like

3515
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:26,580
fighting house to house.

3516
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:27,580
Um,

3517
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:29,910
so there'll be besties is
suicidal kind of guerrilla war.

3518
01:40:29,911 --> 01:40:32,340
They rise up and there'll be like,

3519
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:32,641
you know,

3520
01:40:32,641 --> 01:40:34,200
super close fighting really close.

3521
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:34,770
It was,

3522
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:38,990
and then when the bond they'd hired in
like in a basement and stuff and they,

3523
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:43,230
they drill holes in the walls so they
can fire through and fight through.

3524
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:45,000
And the footage he had,

3525
01:40:45,001 --> 01:40:48,100
he showed me the footage he
had from being like Ryan side,

3526
01:40:48,101 --> 01:40:48,601
close up,

3527
01:40:48,601 --> 01:40:49,650
like running literally in a room,

3528
01:40:49,651 --> 01:40:50,250
Bang,

3529
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:51,180
taking these people out.

3530
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:52,260
And it was like,

3531
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:52,860
wow,

3532
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:54,100
this just crazy.

3533
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:57,970
I was trying to persuade the guy to
let me pull that footage out there.

3534
01:40:58,230 --> 01:40:58,500
You know,

3535
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,880
it did look kind of crazy video game,

3536
01:41:00,881 --> 01:41:02,050
kind of cooler warfare.

3537
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:05,170
So could've offered article
called call [inaudible].

3538
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:06,213
Judy could,

3539
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:07,313
could,

3540
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:08,261
could have Judy.

3541
01:41:08,261 --> 01:41:09,070
Yeah.

3542
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:09,903
Um,

3543
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:11,530
I mean,

3544
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:14,860
Mexico right now is almost like a war.

3545
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:15,461
I mean,

3546
01:41:15,461 --> 01:41:16,960
you can call it a drug war,

3547
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:18,820
but because there's no,

3548
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:21,220
it's not like an army versus army more.

3549
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:22,360
We don't think about it that way.

3550
01:41:22,361 --> 01:41:24,060
But from,

3551
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:27,610
in terms of the amount of violence that
goes on over there and the amount of

3552
01:41:27,611 --> 01:41:29,440
casualties it rivals,

3553
01:41:29,441 --> 01:41:31,090
anything that's going on
in the world right now.

3554
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:31,481
Yeah.

3555
01:41:31,481 --> 01:41:36,010
So I'll be talking a lot about this over
the years and with some experts is a

3556
01:41:36,011 --> 01:41:37,690
good writer called Robert Bunker,

3557
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:41,710
who's an external research if it a
Pentagon and he investigates this stuff.

3558
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:44,710
There's a guy called John
Sullivan from here in California,

3559
01:41:44,711 --> 01:41:48,530
was a police officer who also did
a bunch of research and you know,

3560
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:49,600
got like a doctorate in,

3561
01:41:49,601 --> 01:41:49,841
in,

3562
01:41:49,841 --> 01:41:50,021
in,

3563
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:51,220
in starting all this stuff as well.

3564
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:54,340
Talk to them about their
ideas about what this means,

3565
01:41:54,341 --> 01:41:54,551
you know,

3566
01:41:54,551 --> 01:41:55,241
what is the,

3567
01:41:55,241 --> 01:41:56,074
uh,

3568
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:56,710
um,

3569
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:59,200
how can we define this
in terms of warfare,

3570
01:41:59,340 --> 01:41:59,650
you know,

3571
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:00,483
how's it fit in?

3572
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:02,620
And they directed me to one,

3573
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:06,430
a book by an Israeli historian
called the transformation of war.

3574
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:09,880
And this was written
back in the early 1990s,

3575
01:42:09,881 --> 01:42:13,270
and he basically predicted then you're
going to see a transformation in,

3576
01:42:13,310 --> 01:42:13,440
in,

3577
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,640
in war and armed conflict
around the world.

3578
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:17,850
And in our,

3579
01:42:17,851 --> 01:42:19,180
we have like nuclear weapons,

3580
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:19,810
um,

3581
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:22,960
but they're useless in these
situations and a nuclear weapons.

3582
01:42:22,961 --> 01:42:25,960
You can't use a nuclear weapon
to solve the problem in Mexico.

3583
01:42:25,961 --> 01:42:29,170
You can't use a nuclear weapon
to deal with Islamic state,

3584
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:30,161
uh,

3585
01:42:30,161 --> 01:42:30,371
in a,

3586
01:42:30,371 --> 01:42:32,590
these internally
insurgencies in countries.

3587
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:36,340
So if you look at and Mexico,

3588
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:37,151
so kind of weird,

3589
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:41,920
hybrid hybrid says soap
with tween crime and war.

3590
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:45,250
So I use the word crime Wallace
in some of these places,

3591
01:42:45,251 --> 01:42:46,330
say my Mexico,

3592
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:47,860
El Salvador,

3593
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:48,521
Guatemala,

3594
01:42:48,521 --> 01:42:49,354
Honduras,

3595
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:50,860
where you have now,

3596
01:42:50,861 --> 01:42:52,930
maybe there are some situations
in Mexico where it be,

3597
01:42:52,990 --> 01:42:53,170
you know,

3598
01:42:53,170 --> 01:42:53,431
the Co,

3599
01:42:53,431 --> 01:42:53,590
you know,

3600
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:57,310
there was a group who called the
helis go new generation cartel,

3601
01:42:58,020 --> 01:42:58,451
somebody,

3602
01:42:58,451 --> 01:43:02,500
a guy shot down and military
helicopter using an RPG seven.

3603
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,550
Wow.

3604
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:03,971
Uh,

3605
01:43:03,971 --> 01:43:07,000
and that killed eight soldiers and a
federal policeman in the helicopter.

3606
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,190
There was one shoot out,

3607
01:43:09,191 --> 01:43:14,191
which involved 2000 federal
police and five hungered security.

3608
01:43:15,861 --> 01:43:19,390
It was like 500 cartel
hitmen had this crazy battle.

3609
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:24,880
Mitchell can sometimes you actually get
acid starts to look more like a kind of

3610
01:43:24,881 --> 01:43:25,720
regular conflict.

3611
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:27,370
But generally it's all,

3612
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:29,190
you know what way more kind of hybrids.

3613
01:43:29,191 --> 01:43:30,400
There's kind of weird mix.

3614
01:43:30,401 --> 01:43:32,920
And Taj trying to get my head
around is for a long time,

3615
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:35,230
for some years I was trying to
thinking or is this a civil war?

3616
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:36,521
Should we look at it?

3617
01:43:36,521 --> 01:43:37,570
And then it becomes okay this.

3618
01:43:37,571 --> 01:43:38,171
And then it was,

3619
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:39,340
we know Robert Bunker when heat,

3620
01:43:39,341 --> 01:43:40,780
when I talked to him one time and he said,

3621
01:43:41,530 --> 01:43:41,771
you know,

3622
01:43:41,771 --> 01:43:44,930
like this doesn't fit
into these theories in,

3623
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:45,970
he's not quite war.

3624
01:43:45,971 --> 01:43:46,870
It's more than crime.

3625
01:43:46,871 --> 01:43:48,580
It's a weird hybrid in between,

3626
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:49,780
um,

3627
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:50,950
to kind of crime war.

3628
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:52,370
And that's the way you
got to understand these,

3629
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,233
these things.

3630
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:56,000
But a lot of the conflicts
amount of world today,

3631
01:43:56,001 --> 01:43:56,691
these are spreading.

3632
01:43:56,691 --> 01:43:56,841
I mean,

3633
01:43:56,841 --> 01:43:58,310
you look up Somalia,

3634
01:43:58,311 --> 01:43:59,360
you look at Libya,

3635
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:01,340
you look at a lot of these places,

3636
01:44:01,341 --> 01:44:03,320
it kind of weird mix instability.

3637
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:06,230
And then this is what a lot
of refugees are fleeing from.

3638
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:07,371
And,

3639
01:44:07,371 --> 01:44:07,730
uh,

3640
01:44:07,730 --> 01:44:08,391
I was down in,

3641
01:44:08,391 --> 01:44:09,224
um,

3642
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:10,813
to Kuana,

3643
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:11,863
um,

3644
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:15,980
Christmas I fired the migrant caravan
that came through Mexico Central

3645
01:44:15,981 --> 01:44:16,814
Americans,

3646
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:17,451
you know,

3647
01:44:17,451 --> 01:44:18,380
which caused a big,

3648
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:21,830
a big storm here that Trump kind
of here before the election.

3649
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:23,540
What was that like or is that overblown?

3650
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:25,400
Uh,

3651
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,840
I think it was a big deal.

3652
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:27,650
Um,

3653
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:29,030
was it a publicity event?

3654
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:29,261
Like,

3655
01:44:29,261 --> 01:44:32,110
cause that why they were doing it and
making it such a big deal and everybody's

3656
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:33,410
walking towards the border.

3657
01:44:33,411 --> 01:44:35,750
Like there's a bit more than that.

3658
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:36,710
I think there w uh,

3659
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:37,251
there was,

3660
01:44:37,251 --> 01:44:38,084
um,

3661
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:38,750
there,

3662
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:39,441
this caravan,

3663
01:44:39,441 --> 01:44:43,400
it started a few years ago and they
started off in Mexico for security.

3664
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:44,540
Um,

3665
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:49,430
there was an issue back a few years ago
where the cartels would kidnap migrants

3666
01:44:49,431 --> 01:44:50,264
en masse.

3667
01:44:50,810 --> 01:44:53,900
They will just get loads of migrants
and you think these people are poor,

3668
01:44:53,901 --> 01:44:55,190
how can they make money from them?

3669
01:44:55,670 --> 01:44:56,391
But they'd get them,

3670
01:44:56,391 --> 01:44:59,030
put them in camps and they know they
have family in the United States.

3671
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:00,231
So they say,

3672
01:45:00,231 --> 01:45:00,531
okay,

3673
01:45:00,531 --> 01:45:01,940
we've got 50 people in the camp.

3674
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:06,590
We want $5,000 off each
one of you off your family.

3675
01:45:06,591 --> 01:45:07,251
Like give us number,

3676
01:45:07,251 --> 01:45:08,180
we're going to call your family.

3677
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:08,931
Okay,

3678
01:45:08,931 --> 01:45:09,561
send us the money.

3679
01:45:09,561 --> 01:45:11,080
That and then sometimes they'd agree on,

3680
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:11,241
okay,

3681
01:45:11,241 --> 01:45:12,800
2000 you know like,

3682
01:45:12,801 --> 01:45:15,260
but so sounds like you know you're
making money out of poor people,

3683
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:16,880
but you do it on mass.

3684
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:20,390
You do it 10,000 people and you get
a couple of thousand dollars each.

3685
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:23,150
That's like $20,000 200 to 200 minutes.

3686
01:45:23,151 --> 01:45:24,050
I told her $1 million,

3687
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:28,940
so they started doing caravans for
strength to avoid these mass kidnappings.

3688
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:32,210
What was different about
the latest caravan?

3689
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:33,200
The actually became,

3690
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:34,880
became a caravan crossing borders.

3691
01:45:34,881 --> 01:45:37,550
It used to be going through
parts of Mexico together.

3692
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:39,890
Then they started crossing borders.

3693
01:45:39,891 --> 01:45:43,220
Now the caravan began in October,

3694
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:48,400
around October 12th and there was a call
for them to meet and my friend all lean

3695
01:45:49,701 --> 01:45:51,590
again though the journey's
done in Honduras.

3696
01:45:51,591 --> 01:45:56,390
He was down there filming with his TV
crew putting on TV or they're down here,

3697
01:45:56,391 --> 01:45:57,680
they're going on this caravan.

3698
01:45:57,681 --> 01:45:59,360
It's only when boom and like Lowe's,

3699
01:45:59,361 --> 01:46:01,400
people saw it on TV and they're like,

3700
01:46:01,401 --> 01:46:02,234
I'm going,

3701
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:02,691
I'm leaving,

3702
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:03,740
I'm leaving now.

3703
01:46:03,741 --> 01:46:06,230
The desperation was so heavy in a,

3704
01:46:06,231 --> 01:46:08,810
Honduras isn't a real
meltdown kind of stage.

3705
01:46:08,811 --> 01:46:11,270
Honduras is bad Venezuela's worse,

3706
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:13,460
but Honduras might be like number two,

3707
01:46:13,461 --> 01:46:13,760
far,

3708
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:14,150
you know,

3709
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:16,490
real meltdown cases in
Latin America right now.

3710
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:18,490
So people were like,

3711
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:18,820
no,

3712
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:19,670
talk to some of these people.

3713
01:46:19,671 --> 01:46:21,110
They would say that I saw on TV and I was,

3714
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:21,621
that's it.

3715
01:46:21,621 --> 01:46:23,930
I'm going to decided right away,

3716
01:46:23,931 --> 01:46:24,561
I'm going to get my bag,

3717
01:46:24,561 --> 01:46:25,394
I'm going to go.

3718
01:46:26,030 --> 01:46:27,020
So they arrived at the,

3719
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:29,700
when they went through and got
a mile into quite a miler in,

3720
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:31,760
they became big like 7,000 people,

3721
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:32,900
um,

3722
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:33,770
arrive at the,

3723
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:38,830
at the border with Mexico and you know,

3724
01:46:39,230 --> 01:46:40,370
first of all they try to,

3725
01:46:40,371 --> 01:46:40,521
they,

3726
01:46:40,521 --> 01:46:41,030
they,

3727
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:41,391
there was a,

3728
01:46:41,391 --> 01:46:45,530
a push and shove on the board and tear
gas was fired and they went down and

3729
01:46:45,531 --> 01:46:49,740
cross the river in some of them
walking across with a rope.

3730
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,660
Some of them go across on tires.

3731
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,460
It was kind of crazy scene in the scene.

3732
01:46:54,461 --> 01:46:56,970
Now there was squatted half the
bridge and the now kindness.

3733
01:46:56,971 --> 01:46:58,380
It was kind of kind of a big deal.

3734
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:02,030
I know the idea of calling them
an invading army and so forth was,

3735
01:47:02,050 --> 01:47:02,320
was,

3736
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:03,530
was obviously overblown,

3737
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:06,630
but like I think it
was significant scenes,

3738
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:08,550
quite storic scenes that
were happening down there.

3739
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:13,350
And what was the overall goal to
make it through to the United States?

3740
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:13,861
Yeah,

3741
01:47:13,861 --> 01:47:15,960
I'm in a different people
at different ideas.

3742
01:47:15,961 --> 01:47:17,220
It was kind of on his weird things,

3743
01:47:17,221 --> 01:47:17,431
you know,

3744
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:18,720
like it was girly nights,

3745
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:18,721
days.

3746
01:47:18,721 --> 01:47:22,690
Now some people had no idea where
they will go and had no real plan.

3747
01:47:22,691 --> 01:47:25,080
Some people [inaudible] had very clear,

3748
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:25,831
um,

3749
01:47:25,831 --> 01:47:27,630
cases of being like I'm a refugee.

3750
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:28,080
Um,

3751
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:33,080
in our understanding a bit about
refugee legislation and not fleeing very

3752
01:47:34,110 --> 01:47:37,950
specific cases where they've
been targeted by gangs,

3753
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:39,900
working with corrupt police
who want to kill them,

3754
01:47:39,901 --> 01:47:44,280
who have like hacked them and they've
run and like I want to seek refuge in the

3755
01:47:44,281 --> 01:47:45,810
United States or in Mexico,

3756
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:47,220
someone them seeking refuge in Mexico,

3757
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:50,730
which is not the safest place to see each.

3758
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:51,280
I like,

3759
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:55,620
there's been cases of people who have
one camera man or know who fed Honduras

3760
01:47:55,890 --> 01:47:57,030
and then was killed in Mexico.

3761
01:47:57,390 --> 01:48:02,130
Has there ever been any discussion of the
United States military intervening and

3762
01:48:02,131 --> 01:48:04,230
trying to do something about the cartels?

3763
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:07,170
So there's been like a us,

3764
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:08,123
um,

3765
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:09,540
you know,

3766
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:12,270
some US forces like us marshals,

3767
01:48:12,770 --> 01:48:13,320
um,

3768
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,510
sometimes they're like,

3769
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:16,550
you didn't,

3770
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:20,400
Mexico's very proud of its constitution
and very proud of its sovereignty and

3771
01:48:20,401 --> 01:48:22,350
doesn't want us force acting in Mexico.

3772
01:48:22,351 --> 01:48:22,880
And I think the,

3773
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:23,080
the,

3774
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:24,360
the kind of idea really of,

3775
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:27,420
of US military military's
pretty out there.

3776
01:48:27,610 --> 01:48:28,261
How is pretty,

3777
01:48:28,261 --> 01:48:28,440
uh,

3778
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:28,651
you know,

3779
01:48:28,651 --> 01:48:33,600
like it wouldn't help if he's be
bogged down into more problems and,

3780
01:48:33,630 --> 01:48:35,340
and there'd be nap time
in Mexico Ford App,

3781
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:40,880
but there have been some cases of us
doing some kind of activity in Mexico.

3782
01:48:42,241 --> 01:48:43,260
Like for example,

3783
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:45,900
when they went off to chapel was man,

3784
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:48,840
when they got him and
there's a big shootout.

3785
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:49,510
No,

3786
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:54,180
they've gotten the first time
I said without shots fired and,

3787
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:55,231
and then he went to prison.

3788
01:48:55,231 --> 01:48:57,160
He escaped that one escape from her.

3789
01:48:57,161 --> 01:48:58,230
He says keep more than once.

3790
01:48:58,231 --> 01:48:58,400
Right.

3791
01:48:58,400 --> 01:48:59,191
And escaped twice.

3792
01:48:59,191 --> 01:48:59,430
Yeah.

3793
01:48:59,430 --> 01:49:01,170
Did he get helicoptered out once?

3794
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:01,860
Nothing.

3795
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:04,450
I'd to have been a happy
and how he called down,

3796
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:05,460
which is crazy.

3797
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:08,970
He had the one tunnel escape
with the electric bike,

3798
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:10,410
which was crazy.

3799
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:11,290
Yeah.

3800
01:49:11,290 --> 01:49:11,440
The,

3801
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,690
when he went to the John
and went to the bathroom,

3802
01:49:13,691 --> 01:49:16,080
we just step behind
the door and he's gone.

3803
01:49:16,190 --> 01:49:17,550
That was insane.

3804
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:20,580
It was really weird when I
went to New York right now,

3805
01:49:20,581 --> 01:49:22,320
seeing him in the court in New York,

3806
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:25,980
like seeing him in the flesh after
all these years covering this stuff.

3807
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:28,560
And I saw him and it was like,

3808
01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:28,780
Oh,

3809
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:30,060
I've been to his village before.

3810
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:31,640
I talked to his mother,

3811
01:49:31,641 --> 01:49:34,440
had stayed the night with
his cousin in his village.

3812
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:35,010
Wow.

3813
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:35,940
Up in the mountains.

3814
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:37,343
Uh,

3815
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:38,340
you know,

3816
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:38,731
seen.

3817
01:49:38,731 --> 01:49:39,780
What's it like up there?

3818
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:41,030
It's um,

3819
01:49:41,670 --> 01:49:42,220
an eye,

3820
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:47,010
quite a rugged mountains as
Sierra Mar that is like a,

3821
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:50,040
you go in a car up and uh,

3822
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:50,710
unlike,

3823
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:52,750
we are now in a four by
four serious off road,

3824
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:53,673
up and down.

3825
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:55,143
And

3826
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:58,090
there's people we know wandering around.

3827
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:01,780
They're fully armed guys like ski mask,

3828
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:03,640
Hmong guy like camouflage gear,

3829
01:50:03,641 --> 01:50:06,280
cammo gear key Moscot AK 47,

3830
01:50:06,281 --> 01:50:06,671
just like,

3831
01:50:06,671 --> 01:50:07,690
or not quad bikes,

3832
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:08,950
just driving around the area.

3833
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:09,730
Wow.

3834
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:14,410
And we went up there with a
colleague and a photographer,

3835
01:50:15,130 --> 01:50:16,660
have soy for Time magazine.

3836
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:21,810
And we went up there and drove it to
the village and I bought a bottle of

3837
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:23,640
whiskey thinking to,

3838
01:50:23,641 --> 01:50:24,820
to kind of offer to the,

3839
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:26,390
to the family member to say,

3840
01:50:26,391 --> 01:50:26,530
Oh,

3841
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:26,681
you know,

3842
01:50:26,681 --> 01:50:26,951
here's a,

3843
01:50:26,951 --> 01:50:27,910
here's a bottle of whiskey to,

3844
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:31,180
and when we arrived there and uh,

3845
01:50:31,181 --> 01:50:32,380
and he said we could stay at his house.

3846
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:34,900
And I bought a bottle of whiskey
so they know his and he said,

3847
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:36,610
we don't drink in this house,

3848
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:38,343
we're Christians

3849
01:50:39,870 --> 01:50:41,770
if we take drink.

3850
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:43,600
And this is nice guy.

3851
01:50:43,601 --> 01:50:46,050
And he was like evangelical
Christian wow cousin.

3852
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:46,420
And he was,

3853
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:47,860
we'd sit there talking and he'd be like,

3854
01:50:47,890 --> 01:50:50,770
quoting the Bible well and come and stuff.

3855
01:50:50,771 --> 01:50:53,170
And he knows like the exams
are not understanding.

3856
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:55,511
And there's a church,

3857
01:50:55,511 --> 01:50:57,730
it's an evangelical church right there,

3858
01:50:57,731 --> 01:50:59,260
which is supposedly built by chapel,

3859
01:50:59,710 --> 01:51:02,320
which is mother goes to
right in front of her house.

3860
01:51:02,830 --> 01:51:05,560
And we sat through a three
hour evangelical service.

3861
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:07,540
I'm sitting there with,

3862
01:51:07,650 --> 01:51:07,851
you know,

3863
01:51:07,851 --> 01:51:11,380
Chapos mum there and all his family
members were sitting there and the cars.

3864
01:51:11,381 --> 01:51:12,010
And even said,

3865
01:51:12,010 --> 01:51:12,161
oh,

3866
01:51:12,161 --> 01:51:13,150
we've got some friends here,

3867
01:51:13,151 --> 01:51:13,500
cause he got,

3868
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:13,690
he was,

3869
01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:14,860
he was basically what he said,

3870
01:51:14,861 --> 01:51:15,370
like,

3871
01:51:15,370 --> 01:51:16,270
he stay with me,

3872
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:17,770
you know,

3873
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:19,480
you're my responsibility
if something happens,

3874
01:51:19,481 --> 01:51:19,920
you know,

3875
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:20,860
I'm gonna have to pay for this.

3876
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:22,181
So we're like,

3877
01:51:22,181 --> 01:51:22,301
yeah,

3878
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:23,930
we're not going to behave ourselves in,

3879
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:24,853
in the village.

3880
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:27,130
And he said to the chair,

3881
01:51:27,131 --> 01:51:27,380
to them,

3882
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:28,240
we want to have also have what,

3883
01:51:28,241 --> 01:51:31,930
we have somebody from England here and
somebody from the u s and come out in

3884
01:51:31,931 --> 01:51:32,141
this,

3885
01:51:32,141 --> 01:51:33,430
in this church ceremony.

3886
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:34,641
So yeah,

3887
01:51:34,641 --> 01:51:34,930
yeah.

3888
01:51:34,930 --> 01:51:35,411
Really,

3889
01:51:35,411 --> 01:51:37,090
really bizarre scenes up there.

3890
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:38,880
And there was so bizarre to,

3891
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:42,910
but did you talk to them about the
contradiction of being an evangelical

3892
01:51:42,911 --> 01:51:43,744
Christian,

3893
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:48,430
being involved in essentially a mass
murder and drug running operation?

3894
01:51:48,431 --> 01:51:48,691
So,

3895
01:51:48,691 --> 01:51:50,760
so the cousin is supposedly,

3896
01:51:50,761 --> 01:51:53,380
and he was like a cattle
ranch and now I don't exactly,

3897
01:51:53,381 --> 01:51:53,711
you know,

3898
01:51:53,711 --> 01:51:54,544
obviously he's,

3899
01:51:54,580 --> 01:51:55,270
he calls,

3900
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:56,103
um,

3901
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:58,013
you know,

3902
01:51:58,250 --> 01:51:58,760
he,

3903
01:51:58,760 --> 01:51:59,030
he,

3904
01:51:59,030 --> 01:52:01,240
I didn't know how much he might
have been involved in the past,

3905
01:52:01,241 --> 01:52:01,571
but his,

3906
01:52:01,571 --> 01:52:01,930
his,

3907
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:02,231
his,

3908
01:52:02,231 --> 01:52:02,920
he says he's,

3909
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:03,230
he's,

3910
01:52:03,230 --> 01:52:03,650
he's,

3911
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:05,980
he's a farmer there and the mother,

3912
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:06,640
um,

3913
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:09,190
Chapos mother who's 88 or was 88,

3914
01:52:09,191 --> 01:52:09,550
they're now,

3915
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:12,040
it's like 89 90 now.

3916
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:13,803
Um,

3917
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:14,741
you know,

3918
01:52:14,741 --> 01:52:17,260
she talks about her son
with kind of pride it,

3919
01:52:17,261 --> 01:52:21,250
I did it and I didn't push too hard and
there was a gunman around and stuff.

3920
01:52:21,330 --> 01:52:22,840
I didn't like [inaudible].

3921
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:24,543
Um,

3922
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:25,841
but,

3923
01:52:25,841 --> 01:52:26,080
uh,

3924
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:26,560
but yeah,

3925
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:27,041
I mean they,

3926
01:52:27,041 --> 01:52:27,480
this is,

3927
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:28,450
this is their way of life.

3928
01:52:28,451 --> 01:52:28,721
I mean these,

3929
01:52:28,721 --> 01:52:29,320
these are,

3930
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:30,880
so seeing him in the court,

3931
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:31,840
um,

3932
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,100
was kind of bizarre seeing,

3933
01:52:33,101 --> 01:52:33,281
you know,

3934
01:52:33,281 --> 01:52:34,091
seeing him right there.

3935
01:52:34,091 --> 01:52:34,924
And in New York,

3936
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:35,773
in Brooklyn,

3937
01:52:36,490 --> 01:52:36,700
you know,

3938
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:38,680
right there in Brooklyn
and they bought it.

3939
01:52:38,681 --> 01:52:42,400
All of these crazy characters
is p as a cooperating witnesses.

3940
01:52:42,401 --> 01:52:44,320
They brought in 14 cooperating witnesses.

3941
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:46,490
I'm on a bunch of other gangs.

3942
01:52:46,491 --> 01:52:47,900
How does they protect those people?

3943
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:49,040
Yeah,

3944
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:49,821
I mean heavily,

3945
01:52:49,821 --> 01:52:50,810
heavily protected.

3946
01:52:50,980 --> 01:52:51,350
I mean,

3947
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:51,700
I think,

3948
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:52,533
I think,

3949
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:57,410
I think it was ethically very questionable
why they bought a lot of those people

3950
01:52:57,411 --> 01:52:57,740
in.

3951
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:58,160
Um,

3952
01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:58,993
they were,

3953
01:52:59,210 --> 01:53:04,210
they brought in one guy whose nickname
is Jupiter Petta who confessed himself as

3954
01:53:05,541 --> 01:53:08,960
many as 150 killings and
maybe did a lot more,

3955
01:53:09,410 --> 01:53:09,741
uh,

3956
01:53:09,741 --> 01:53:10,101
and,

3957
01:53:10,101 --> 01:53:11,930
and he makes a deal,

3958
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:16,880
likely makes a deal to cooperate
against their chapters.

3959
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:19,730
So you get into a kind
of weird intrigued there,

3960
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:20,350
um,

3961
01:53:20,350 --> 01:53:22,160
about what the government was doing.

3962
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:23,760
This whole case is,

3963
01:53:23,761 --> 01:53:27,170
there's a history in this country
with the prosecuting the mob,

3964
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:28,580
John Guardian,

3965
01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:33,380
Sammy the bull Gravano who so admitted
murderer and talked about the murders

3966
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:37,620
that he committed and still they
allowed him to get free day one.

3967
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:42,050
His want to hit John got his lawyer
was one of the lawyers for our chapel.

3968
01:53:42,290 --> 01:53:42,920
Of course.

3969
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:43,320
Yeah.

3970
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:46,020
And then they head out to the,

3971
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,050
that they got something to
do with these lawyers there.

3972
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:50,030
It was a crazy kind of show.

3973
01:53:50,350 --> 01:53:50,570
Yeah.

3974
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:51,081
It was weird.

3975
01:53:51,081 --> 01:53:53,420
It was like in a New York and this
show they were putting on there.

3976
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:54,620
Um,

3977
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:55,030
it,

3978
01:53:55,030 --> 01:53:58,850
I felt kind of disconnect with the
things I've been seeing over the last few

3979
01:53:58,850 --> 01:53:58,851
years.

3980
01:53:58,851 --> 01:53:59,930
And it didn't really,

3981
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,070
why was it in New York?

3982
01:54:02,030 --> 01:54:06,170
The United they indicted him and a bunch
of places and I think they chose New

3983
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:08,120
York for the reason they
wanted more of a show.

3984
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:08,960
Wow.

3985
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:09,320
I think,

3986
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:09,761
I think they,

3987
01:54:09,761 --> 01:54:09,970
and they,

3988
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:10,150
they,

3989
01:54:10,150 --> 01:54:12,260
they bought in a more than 50 witnesses,

3990
01:54:13,050 --> 01:54:13,280
you know,

3991
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:13,761
three and a half,

3992
01:54:13,761 --> 01:54:15,110
three months of Crile.

3993
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:15,560
Uh,

3994
01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:16,580
what was his defense?

3995
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:21,650
So they originally tried
a bit of a defense of,

3996
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:26,680
they wanted to go back to fence of how
there's a kind of government conspiracy,

3997
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:27,500
um,

3998
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:32,500
of like showing things like fast and
furious that you mentioned like saying,

3999
01:54:33,261 --> 01:54:33,411
oh,

4000
01:54:33,411 --> 01:54:35,660
how come the government's
trafficking guns,

4001
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:40,490
two cartels and one of the witnesses
had before one of the witnesses against

4002
01:54:40,491 --> 01:54:40,591
him,

4003
01:54:40,591 --> 01:54:44,450
it before use this weird defense
called public authority saying he had

4004
01:54:44,451 --> 01:54:48,200
permission from the United States
government to traffic drugs are basically

4005
01:54:48,201 --> 01:54:50,690
saying there's a kind of conspiracy
involving in Mexican government's tardy,

4006
01:54:50,691 --> 01:54:52,850
corrupt and working with cartels.

4007
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:57,170
The U s government is corrupt and
working cartels and having very specific

4008
01:54:57,171 --> 01:55:02,120
agencies and El Chapo was kind of a full
guy that they're putting this blame on

4009
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:03,170
now.

4010
01:55:03,170 --> 01:55:04,880
That didn't really the gut,

4011
01:55:04,881 --> 01:55:07,130
the u s prosecutors shut that down.

4012
01:55:07,131 --> 01:55:07,581
And the judge,

4013
01:55:07,581 --> 01:55:08,414
they just said,

4014
01:55:08,450 --> 01:55:09,770
you can't talk about this stuff.

4015
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:10,790
You can't say that.

4016
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:12,650
So I went fast and furious,

4017
01:55:12,651 --> 01:55:13,484
came up,

4018
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:14,361
they said,

4019
01:55:14,361 --> 01:55:14,960
no,

4020
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:15,800
you can't talk about it.

4021
01:55:15,801 --> 01:55:16,401
You can't talk.

4022
01:55:16,401 --> 01:55:16,801
You can't,

4023
01:55:16,801 --> 01:55:17,960
who couldn't talk about it in a court?

4024
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:19,700
Well that's ethically ambiguous,

4025
01:55:19,701 --> 01:55:19,851
right?

4026
01:55:19,851 --> 01:55:20,040
Yeah,

4027
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:20,871
exactly.

4028
01:55:20,871 --> 01:55:22,220
That's a real thing that happened.

4029
01:55:22,221 --> 01:55:22,640
Yeah.

4030
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:23,220
So there was,

4031
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:23,601
you know,

4032
01:55:23,601 --> 01:55:25,040
we can't talk about it as you add to that.

4033
01:55:25,190 --> 01:55:27,620
And then the defense tried a bit,

4034
01:55:27,621 --> 01:55:29,660
well they had audios of
El Chapo and they said,

4035
01:55:29,661 --> 01:55:29,811
Oh,

4036
01:55:29,811 --> 01:55:30,920
do you know how you noticed him?

4037
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:34,580
And is he really the main
guy in the law cartel now?

4038
01:55:34,581 --> 01:55:36,950
There is as well.

4039
01:55:36,970 --> 01:55:37,400
Um,

4040
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:39,070
very possibly he's not the top guy in,

4041
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:39,620
in Arcata.

4042
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:44,010
They might well be another guy called
miles and bother who's the number one?

4043
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:46,920
And he might be more of
an emblematic figure,

4044
01:55:47,310 --> 01:55:52,310
but for some reason El Chapo became
the most famous in the world.

4045
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:53,560
And so this other guy's,

4046
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:54,240
he's still free.

4047
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:54,351
Yeah,

4048
01:55:54,351 --> 01:55:54,920
he's still free.

4049
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:55,680
What is his name again?

4050
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:56,281
Myo.

4051
01:55:56,281 --> 01:55:57,030
Zambada.

4052
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:57,450
Uh,

4053
01:55:57,450 --> 01:55:58,000
and where's he?

4054
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:58,690
Uh,

4055
01:55:58,690 --> 01:56:00,100
I knew somewhere in mountains.

4056
01:56:00,170 --> 01:56:02,780
Mezcal throws in the mountains often many.

4057
01:56:02,830 --> 01:56:03,211
What are these,

4058
01:56:03,211 --> 01:56:04,260
these weird things you'd think?

4059
01:56:04,261 --> 01:56:07,620
Like if you're a drug lord and
you've got all of the money,

4060
01:56:07,910 --> 01:56:08,251
you know,

4061
01:56:08,251 --> 01:56:10,380
you've got millions,

4062
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:10,381
billions,

4063
01:56:10,381 --> 01:56:10,711
they say,

4064
01:56:10,711 --> 01:56:11,880
let's say hundreds and millions.

4065
01:56:11,881 --> 01:56:16,170
I think they exaggerate how much money
some of these guys have individually.

4066
01:56:16,860 --> 01:56:18,220
But then you could go
anywhere in the world.

4067
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:19,500
Do you think you could go somewhere out?

4068
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:22,480
But these guys tend to be
in their places that they,

4069
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:23,353
they're,

4070
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:23,911
they're,

4071
01:56:23,911 --> 01:56:24,511
they're people.

4072
01:56:24,511 --> 01:56:27,080
Like some of these people are
people who are very educated.

4073
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:28,030
I mean a chopper who's,

4074
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:29,071
as a kid,

4075
01:56:29,071 --> 01:56:34,071
he was carrying sacks full of oranges to
sell almost an education and they start

4076
01:56:35,431 --> 01:56:40,431
handling hundreds of billions of dollars
that do dealing with a billion dollar

4077
01:56:40,501 --> 01:56:44,460
international business and they've got
the capacity to understand and deal with

4078
01:56:44,461 --> 01:56:45,240
that.

4079
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,140
But at the same time,

4080
01:56:46,141 --> 01:56:49,110
they still really hyper
local in some ways.

4081
01:56:49,111 --> 01:56:50,430
They're still like people who,

4082
01:56:50,730 --> 01:56:52,110
they understand their world,

4083
01:56:52,111 --> 01:56:54,960
they understand it from their
environment to control them,

4084
01:56:54,961 --> 01:56:56,580
become masters of their environment,

4085
01:56:57,220 --> 01:56:57,690
um,

4086
01:56:57,690 --> 01:57:00,390
to become kind of powerful in,

4087
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:01,440
in that place,

4088
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:03,420
who in that place.

4089
01:57:03,421 --> 01:57:04,090
But you know,

4090
01:57:04,090 --> 01:57:04,561
they couldn't,

4091
01:57:04,561 --> 01:57:04,801
you know,

4092
01:57:04,801 --> 01:57:08,130
the idea of them go into like sitting in
Italy in a cafe and kind of running it

4093
01:57:08,131 --> 01:57:08,940
from there and they don't,

4094
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:11,910
it's kind of beyond that would have
to be there near the business because

4095
01:57:11,911 --> 01:57:13,350
otherwise someone would just take it over,

4096
01:57:13,351 --> 01:57:13,710
right?

4097
01:57:13,710 --> 01:57:14,120
Yeah,

4098
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:14,310
yeah,

4099
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:14,491
yeah,

4100
01:57:14,491 --> 01:57:14,671
yeah.

4101
01:57:14,671 --> 01:57:18,000
So that's how many have to run
that thing with an iron first.

4102
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:18,751
Yeah.

4103
01:57:18,751 --> 01:57:18,961
I mean,

4104
01:57:18,961 --> 01:57:19,210
you could,

4105
01:57:19,210 --> 01:57:19,941
you could think though,

4106
01:57:19,941 --> 01:57:20,880
or maybe like,

4107
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:21,691
yeah,

4108
01:57:21,691 --> 01:57:22,420
I guess so.

4109
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:23,880
He really get your Christian cousin,

4110
01:57:23,881 --> 01:57:24,720
you won't rip you off.

4111
01:57:24,810 --> 01:57:25,643
Yeah.

4112
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:27,391
But how am I also,

4113
01:57:27,391 --> 01:57:28,860
how much money do you need to make?

4114
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:29,670
Right?

4115
01:57:29,670 --> 01:57:30,510
Taking you get out.

4116
01:57:30,570 --> 01:57:31,650
Maybe when it,

4117
01:57:31,651 --> 01:57:32,730
again with corruption,

4118
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:35,700
I mean there's the issue of like
a lot of police in Mexico poor,

4119
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:37,830
so that's why they take deals.

4120
01:57:37,831 --> 01:57:38,220
But there's uh,

4121
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:39,480
an ex governor called Thomas,

4122
01:57:39,481 --> 01:57:44,400
he Addington who I met a few years ago
when he was governor of Tamaulipas state

4123
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:46,050
and uh,

4124
01:57:46,051 --> 01:57:46,440
again,

4125
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:50,070
he was not only taking money from drug
traffickers after he left being governor,

4126
01:57:50,071 --> 01:57:53,340
he got into drug trafficking
himself and he's like,

4127
01:57:53,370 --> 01:57:53,701
you think,

4128
01:57:53,701 --> 01:57:56,070
well once you made couple of million,

4129
01:57:56,380 --> 01:57:57,110
right,

4130
01:57:57,110 --> 01:57:59,040
do you need to make an art 10 million?

4131
01:57:59,041 --> 01:57:59,421
But then again,

4132
01:57:59,421 --> 01:57:59,571
governor,

4133
01:57:59,571 --> 01:58:00,404
the same with,

4134
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:02,340
I don't understand the
business we've been,

4135
01:58:02,341 --> 01:58:03,200
this is what does it,

4136
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:03,931
what's the incentive?

4137
01:58:03,931 --> 01:58:05,670
Why did they think they always
want to make more money?

4138
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:06,371
I don't know.

4139
01:58:06,371 --> 01:58:09,260
I mean we were talking about that recently
with Jeff Bezos when we found out he

4140
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:11,200
has $150 billion.

4141
01:58:11,201 --> 01:58:13,270
Like when do you just say we're good,

4142
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:14,201
we're good.

4143
01:58:14,201 --> 01:58:14,770
Yeah.

4144
01:58:14,770 --> 01:58:15,130
I mean,

4145
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:16,090
I don't know.

4146
01:58:16,091 --> 01:58:17,590
I think it becomes,

4147
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:20,590
it's a game more than it is anything else.

4148
01:58:20,591 --> 01:58:24,250
Like there might as well be
playing Parcheesi or monopoly
or what they're trying

4149
01:58:24,251 --> 01:58:24,880
to win.

4150
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:25,121
You know,

4151
01:58:25,121 --> 01:58:27,130
they're trying to constantly win.

4152
01:58:27,131 --> 01:58:31,180
And also you have an obligation
because you're a CEO of this company,

4153
01:58:31,181 --> 01:58:32,710
so you,

4154
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:36,940
you're running this enormous business
that's earning money for all these other

4155
01:58:36,941 --> 01:58:37,810
people as well.

4156
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:39,430
It's all very complicated though.

4157
01:58:39,431 --> 01:58:41,920
That has to do with a lot
of psychological where

4158
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:45,520
people can't put things into perspective
and they get caught up in the race.

4159
01:58:45,780 --> 01:58:46,380
Hmm.

4160
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:46,480
Yeah.

4161
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:46,781
I guess,

4162
01:58:46,781 --> 01:58:46,931
yeah,

4163
01:58:46,931 --> 01:58:49,800
maybe drug traffickers are thinking that
same thing somebody does when they're

4164
01:58:49,801 --> 01:58:50,634
making.

4165
01:58:50,670 --> 01:58:51,870
And then also that like,

4166
01:58:52,010 --> 01:58:52,770
like,

4167
01:58:52,770 --> 01:58:53,500
you know,

4168
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:55,510
people have explained to
me involved in this world,

4169
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:57,100
they make a lot of money,

4170
01:58:57,101 --> 01:58:58,150
but they spend a lot of money.

4171
01:58:58,670 --> 01:58:59,980
While these numbers are wrong,

4172
01:58:59,990 --> 01:59:00,800
knock with chopper.

4173
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:01,633
They said,

4174
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:02,021
um,

4175
01:59:02,021 --> 01:59:03,580
his worth $14 billion.

4176
01:59:03,581 --> 01:59:04,900
That's what the US government said.

4177
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,090
In that case he's worth 14 billion.

4178
01:59:07,810 --> 01:59:09,520
But then he's,

4179
01:59:09,810 --> 01:59:10,140
you know,

4180
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:10,931
peerless bay to me,

4181
01:59:10,931 --> 01:59:11,121
you,

4182
01:59:11,121 --> 01:59:11,620
you know,

4183
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:13,930
14 billion is when you
take the value of drugs.

4184
01:59:13,931 --> 01:59:14,630
You'll send Hee Hee.

4185
01:59:14,630 --> 01:59:16,520
He trafficked and you're
adding the opera singers,

4186
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:17,530
$14 billion worth,

4187
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:21,700
but really all the time
you're paying back suppliers,

4188
01:59:21,701 --> 01:59:25,350
you're paying people off
your own money and you know,

4189
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:28,020
and you know you're
buying hippos and chats,

4190
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:30,760
cold covered rolls Royces.

4191
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:31,593
Yeah.

4192
01:59:32,350 --> 01:59:33,011
There's some of that.

4193
01:59:33,011 --> 01:59:33,910
I think some of that was,

4194
01:59:33,911 --> 01:59:35,110
might have been exaggerated with him.

4195
01:59:35,111 --> 01:59:37,390
He had a lot of kind of more
like middle class houses.

4196
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:37,900
Oh yeah.

4197
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:38,800
I went to one of the last,

4198
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:41,590
the last hideout he was caught and
it was more like a middle class.

4199
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:43,210
It's just a normal house in a house,

4200
01:59:43,211 --> 01:59:44,200
but he'd have a lot of those.

4201
01:59:44,230 --> 01:59:46,060
What the fuck happened with Sean Penn?

4202
01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:46,630
Yeah.

4203
01:59:46,630 --> 01:59:49,030
Why was Sean Penn up there talking to him?

4204
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:51,040
That was so strange.

4205
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:51,580
Yeah.

4206
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:55,930
The photograph was Sean Penn and shaking
hands with them and then Conor McGregor

4207
01:59:55,931 --> 02:00:00,790
wore that same t shirt and it took
that same pose on when he was,

4208
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:02,590
when he was a got of fight.

4209
02:00:02,591 --> 02:00:03,341
Eddie Alvarez,

4210
02:00:03,341 --> 02:00:04,174
I believe it was.

4211
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:05,080
Yeah.

4212
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:05,980
What was that about,

4213
02:00:05,981 --> 02:00:07,480
like why was Sean Penn visiting him?

4214
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:07,790
Yeah.

4215
02:00:07,790 --> 02:00:08,740
Bizarre moment.

4216
02:00:08,770 --> 02:00:09,980
I mean you have a,

4217
02:00:11,310 --> 02:00:14,080
an actor who's played
gangsters areas right there.

4218
02:00:14,110 --> 02:00:14,943
Yeah.

4219
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:21,630
I'm an actor who's played gangsters
with a gangster who they're having,

4220
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:22,260
you know,

4221
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:23,230
movies made by him.

4222
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:26,550
And there was a woman that Sean
Penn knew that hooked us all up.

4223
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:27,453
But I'm just gonna steal the,

4224
02:00:27,620 --> 02:00:30,040
she's a famous Mexican actress.

4225
02:00:30,110 --> 02:00:30,650
Yeah.

4226
02:00:30,650 --> 02:00:31,120
Yeah.

4227
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:31,461
So,

4228
02:00:31,461 --> 02:00:31,920
so the story,

4229
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:32,910
the whole story started there.

4230
02:00:32,911 --> 02:00:33,181
She is.

4231
02:00:33,181 --> 02:00:33,640
Yeah,

4232
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:36,190
I've got them all power on
around hey me with a murder.

4233
02:00:37,550 --> 02:00:38,383
Yes.

4234
02:00:38,620 --> 02:00:40,060
I nice to be married to Madonna.

4235
02:00:41,170 --> 02:00:43,560
So the story started,

4236
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:44,111
so Kate,

4237
02:00:44,111 --> 02:00:45,400
the Castillo who you see there,

4238
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:51,150
she was an actress in a TV
series about drug traffickers,

4239
02:00:51,880 --> 02:00:54,070
which have now become a
huge deal in Latin America.

4240
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:58,610
They called out like telenovelas
means like soap operas kind of thing,

4241
02:00:58,611 --> 02:01:02,050
series TV series and the whole badge
them made about drug traffickers,

4242
02:01:02,410 --> 02:01:03,243
which are really popular.

4243
02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:06,280
And she was in one
called La Reina del Sur,

4244
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:07,173
the Queen of the south.

4245
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:12,970
And in that she played this
drug trafficker and afterwards
in some kind of weird

4246
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:17,530
moment afterwards,

4247
02:01:17,531 --> 02:01:20,200
I think she was like really
into her role and stuff.

4248
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:22,630
She came out with this message,

4249
02:01:22,631 --> 02:01:23,800
she wrote saying,

4250
02:01:24,700 --> 02:01:26,650
I'm in a Mexico is in such a disease,

4251
02:01:26,651 --> 02:01:28,960
such tragic situation in Mexico.

4252
02:01:29,590 --> 02:01:30,423
Um,

4253
02:01:30,570 --> 02:01:31,403
you know,

4254
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:35,700
why don't they come in a drug
traffickers common like um,

4255
02:01:36,430 --> 02:01:37,780
traffic with love.

4256
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:40,700
I trust you more than I do the government.

4257
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:44,150
And these are kind of sentiments
that some people have,

4258
02:01:44,151 --> 02:01:44,511
but you know,

4259
02:01:44,511 --> 02:01:47,150
it was kind of a strange thing kind
of bit of an out there thing for,

4260
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:48,830
for a TV star to say.

4261
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:51,830
And then Chapo,

4262
02:01:52,430 --> 02:01:57,430
El Chapo apparently became kind of
enamel with her seeing her on TV and they

4263
02:01:59,121 --> 02:02:00,650
started this kind of communication.

4264
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:06,880
Now Sean Penn then got involved
in this and was like Ah,

4265
02:02:09,201 --> 02:02:09,381
in,

4266
02:02:09,381 --> 02:02:12,590
I'm going to go there as well
and we can talk about the idea,

4267
02:02:12,591 --> 02:02:17,591
but the end of the tens of the meeting
was as well talking about making a movie

4268
02:02:17,601 --> 02:02:22,601
or TV series of his story and our
chapel giving the rights to Kate.

4269
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:25,400
The Castillo in Sean Penn was
kind of involved in this summer.

4270
02:02:25,401 --> 02:02:29,570
Now Sean Penn is a bit of discussion
that now that Sean Penn and Kate del

4271
02:02:29,571 --> 02:02:30,920
Castillo fell out over this.

4272
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:33,470
They have different versions
of what happened there.

4273
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:34,941
But you know,

4274
02:02:34,941 --> 02:02:37,850
Sean Penn decided to go and write this
story for rolling stone about how to

4275
02:02:37,851 --> 02:02:38,540
experience,

4276
02:02:38,540 --> 02:02:39,373
yeah.

4277
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:44,410
So they went then and his meeting was
arranged and they went up to the mountains

4278
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:48,170
and when that photo was taken and I,

4279
02:02:48,171 --> 02:02:52,160
they eat at that point that he didn't
actually give an interview to Sean Penn,

4280
02:02:52,161 --> 02:02:56,240
but they had a dinner and had a
meeting up in the mountains and,

4281
02:02:57,160 --> 02:02:58,310
and then left.

4282
02:02:58,370 --> 02:03:00,470
And then there were meant to afterwards,

4283
02:03:00,471 --> 02:03:04,490
there was then a big
attempt to hit chapel,

4284
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:05,653
but he escaped.

4285
02:03:06,290 --> 02:03:11,290
So that's when some people say that the
Mexican government had followed them in.

4286
02:03:11,781 --> 02:03:12,800
I use their,

4287
02:03:12,801 --> 02:03:14,570
their trace or try and get to a chapel,

4288
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:16,490
but he did escape.

4289
02:03:16,490 --> 02:03:19,730
He almost got caught close to there
quite soon after as by escaped.

4290
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:21,500
That's makes sense.

4291
02:03:21,501 --> 02:03:21,861
I mean,

4292
02:03:21,861 --> 02:03:24,060
how else would Sean Penn
be able to slide through?

4293
02:03:24,061 --> 02:03:25,340
Is a famous actor.

4294
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:27,020
I bet he doesn't even speak Spanish.

4295
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:27,580
Yeah.

4296
02:03:27,580 --> 02:03:28,940
That housing daggy does.

4297
02:03:29,230 --> 02:03:29,570
I mean,

4298
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:30,810
I don't know if,

4299
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:31,820
so if he was followed.

4300
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:33,020
I'm not saying that he was,

4301
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:33,943
um,

4302
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:34,701
in any case,

4303
02:03:34,701 --> 02:03:35,960
in any way deliberately.

4304
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:36,530
No,

4305
02:03:36,530 --> 02:03:37,370
I leading them there,

4306
02:03:37,371 --> 02:03:38,990
but it's something that I
think about all the time.

4307
02:03:38,991 --> 02:03:39,621
I think about,

4308
02:03:39,621 --> 02:03:39,831
okay,

4309
02:03:39,831 --> 02:03:42,050
if I'm going to meet criminals,

4310
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:43,753
um,

4311
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:45,170
am I being followed?

4312
02:03:45,970 --> 02:03:46,280
Um,

4313
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:48,080
and am I going to lead,

4314
02:03:48,230 --> 02:03:48,411
you know,

4315
02:03:48,411 --> 02:03:51,200
what's my connection with Laura
force much conviction with criminals.

4316
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:54,510
It's a very difficult thing that I've
been bantering and thinking about for lot

4317
02:03:54,511 --> 02:03:55,344
of years.

4318
02:03:55,490 --> 02:03:56,900
So anyway,

4319
02:03:57,130 --> 02:03:58,600
the Chapo escapes,

4320
02:03:58,810 --> 02:03:59,150
um,

4321
02:03:59,150 --> 02:04:01,790
and then said he couldn't meet up
again for the interview because he was,

4322
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:03,350
it was too hot for him.

4323
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:09,040
So they made this video interview
where he was sent some questions and he

4324
02:04:09,201 --> 02:04:11,930
videoed himself answering the questions,

4325
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:13,460
which is kind of interesting.

4326
02:04:13,461 --> 02:04:17,060
It was the first kind of
statement he made and he said,

4327
02:04:17,061 --> 02:04:18,410
I know various things.

4328
02:04:18,411 --> 02:04:19,880
I've been doing it since I was 15.

4329
02:04:20,210 --> 02:04:21,410
It didn't really give much away.

4330
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:25,040
And then he was caught and when
he was caught they were like,

4331
02:04:25,041 --> 02:04:26,360
we've got to move to stories.

4332
02:04:26,361 --> 02:04:30,500
And then the story came out large bang
after he was caught in early 2016 so it

4333
02:04:30,501 --> 02:04:33,140
had to have some sort of an
impact and then catching them.

4334
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:34,183
I must've,

4335
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:34,820
I mean,

4336
02:04:34,820 --> 02:04:35,970
it's possible.

4337
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:36,450
Uh,

4338
02:04:36,450 --> 02:04:37,283
makes sense.

4339
02:04:37,570 --> 02:04:38,790
It's possible.

4340
02:04:38,791 --> 02:04:39,010
I mean,

4341
02:04:39,010 --> 02:04:40,350
chopper thing was pretty,

4342
02:04:40,790 --> 02:04:40,951
you know,

4343
02:04:40,951 --> 02:04:45,951
he'd already been caught before he
was caught in 2014 was imprisoned,

4344
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:52,850
escaped in 2015 through that tunnel and
then was caught again in 2016 so yeah,

4345
02:04:54,931 --> 02:04:57,930
me maybe it had an impact on United on
that when they were looking for them.

4346
02:04:57,990 --> 02:04:58,171
Yeah.

4347
02:04:58,171 --> 02:04:59,360
They were looking for him and he seemed,

4348
02:04:59,361 --> 02:05:02,130
he seemed to have lost a lot of
his protection in a he before.

4349
02:05:02,131 --> 02:05:03,510
And I go back a few years.

4350
02:05:04,230 --> 02:05:06,930
I know he had enormous protection
in and there's mountains.

4351
02:05:06,931 --> 02:05:07,560
I mean,

4352
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:09,810
in a village you see
there's a house above,

4353
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:10,221
like there's a,

4354
02:05:10,221 --> 02:05:13,740
there's kind of a main clearing
where his mother's compound is in,

4355
02:05:13,741 --> 02:05:16,710
so pretty basic still that
village then are up from there.

4356
02:05:16,711 --> 02:05:18,270
You see a,

4357
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:19,860
um,

4358
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:21,690
a house on a hill and
apparent that as well.

4359
02:05:21,691 --> 02:05:22,590
Chapter for long time.

4360
02:05:22,591 --> 02:05:22,770
He said,

4361
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:23,790
don't just stay in that house.

4362
02:05:24,620 --> 02:05:25,230
Um,

4363
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:25,411
in,

4364
02:05:25,411 --> 02:05:25,570
uh,

4365
02:05:25,570 --> 02:05:26,430
in one is in the run.

4366
02:05:26,431 --> 02:05:27,120
In the past,

4367
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:28,140
he had so much protection.

4368
02:05:28,141 --> 02:05:30,690
Anytime the military will
come close at the mountain,

4369
02:05:30,691 --> 02:05:34,080
you've got hundreds of people in radio
saying that if they were coming up,

4370
02:05:34,510 --> 02:05:35,343
I'd get clear,

4371
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:37,343
man,

4372
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:39,090
what a crazy world you study.

4373
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:39,631
Really.

4374
02:05:39,631 --> 02:05:39,991
It's,

4375
02:05:39,991 --> 02:05:40,470
uh,

4376
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:41,161
it's amazing.

4377
02:05:41,161 --> 02:05:44,010
I really appreciate your coming
here and talking to me about this.

4378
02:05:44,011 --> 02:05:44,281
And,

4379
02:05:44,281 --> 02:05:44,640
uh,

4380
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:46,560
this book is El Narco.

4381
02:05:46,590 --> 02:05:48,120
Do you have more books are available?

4382
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:48,451
Yeah,

4383
02:05:48,451 --> 02:05:50,040
she'll say my first book sell narco.

4384
02:05:50,310 --> 02:05:53,190
My second book is a gangster warlords,

4385
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:53,670
uh,

4386
02:05:53,670 --> 02:05:54,630
which also has,

4387
02:05:54,650 --> 02:05:55,483
uh,

4388
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:56,160
um,

4389
02:05:56,160 --> 02:05:59,650
stuff on their ms 13
on the gangs in Brazil,

4390
02:05:59,651 --> 02:06:01,830
the gas in Jamaica as well as Mexico.

4391
02:06:02,310 --> 02:06:03,690
And I'm working on my third book now.

4392
02:06:04,170 --> 02:06:05,610
And the third book is about,

4393
02:06:05,611 --> 02:06:06,690
about gun trafficking.

4394
02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:07,590
Hmm.

4395
02:06:07,590 --> 02:06:07,831
Well,

4396
02:06:07,831 --> 02:06:08,101
listen,

4397
02:06:08,101 --> 02:06:08,550
man,

4398
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:10,440
I really appreciate
your time and that you,

4399
02:06:10,441 --> 02:06:11,610
you've lived a very,

4400
02:06:11,611 --> 02:06:12,810
very fascinating life.

4401
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:13,830
Stay safe out there,

4402
02:06:13,831 --> 02:06:14,360

4403
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:14,960
Great to be here.

4404
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:15,421
Thank you brother.

4405
02:06:15,421 --> 02:06:15,871
Appreciate it,

4406
02:06:15,871 --> 02:06:16,110
man.

4407
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:16,531
Thanks man.

4408
02:06:16,531 --> 02:06:17,364
Thank you very much.

4409
02:06:19,940 --> 02:06:20,240
Wow.
