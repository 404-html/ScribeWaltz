1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,450
Three two,
one.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,740
Stir it up,
nick.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,350
We're live.
Hello everyone.

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,810
Hello everyone.
Put the uh,

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,580
ear cups on and cheers,
sir.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,780
Oh Man.
Thank you joe.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,710
Thanks for being here,
man.

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,780
Yeah.
Thank you for breaking me out here man.

9
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:23,650
I know we meant to do this before,
but I hope now with all this good energy

10
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:26,230
between us,
we can do this properly for the Indians.

11
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,250
Yeah,
for sure.

12
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,931
Listen,
man,

13
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:33,931
to say that you've had a crazy
experience in this life is one of the

14
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,520
most understated things a person could
ever say.

15
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,103
I mean,

16
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,280
where do we begin?
Right?

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,140
Let's tell everybody your store.
So you were wrongfully committed of

18
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:50,141
murder.
You spent 22 years on death row before

19
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:53,270
you were exonerated by DNA evidence.

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,540
Yeah.

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,040
Hello everyone.
My name is Nick Harris and I was X.

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,640
Joe said,
convicted and sentenced to die for rape

23
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:07,540
and murder.
I didn't commit at the age of 21 in 1981

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,850
of woman named
Mrs. Craig was murdered in Delaware.

25
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,470
I have never met the woman.
I was in prison on unrelated charges and

26
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:20,740
I stupidly made up a story to try and
get out of those charges.

27
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,730
The police soon feel realized that I was
a liar and they fabricated the charges

28
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:31,810
around me then so it's ironic than in a
few days you're going to upper darby,

29
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:34,630
Pennsylvania,
and that's where the murder happened.

30
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:35,680
Really.
Basically,

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,360
and Linda May,
Craig was leaving her job at 4:05 PM on

32
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:42,850
December 15th,
1981 she's going home.

33
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:45,430
She gets abducted.
I don't know any of this,

34
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,120
but I tried in desperation to get out of
a lie that this officer put on me.

35
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,190
Fuck,
I got pulled over in a stolen car.

36
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,890
The cop beats me up.
He puts charges on me.

37
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,100
I'm facing life imprisonment and I'm a
junkie because all of my life I was

38
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:03,260
destroyed by what happened to me.
At the age of seven I had my head beaten

39
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:08,261
him by a man with a rock in his hand
after he sexually assaulted me and I did

40
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:11,830
all the stupid things that people can do
in the aftermath.

41
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,610
I kept it a secret and I let it foster
all the anger in me.

42
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:19,930
I became very aggressive as a child and
I ended up in trouble all the time.

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
And when I was in prison on these
unrelated charges to the murder,

44
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,410
I stupidly fell into that mindset of
desperation of trying to get out of it.

45
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,800
So the police put a prisoner in the cell
next to me.

46
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:34,270
He said,
I confess to him,

47
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,460
I was given a three day trial.

48
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,430
I was sentenced to death and put on
death row.

49
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,970
And then stupidly I escaped from prison
in 1985 and ended up on the FBI's most

50
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:51,031
wanted list to get out.
I was being transported to court and the

51
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:53,940
sheriffs were being cool.
We have,

52
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,580
first they were talking about what was
going on in Philly.

53
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,940
They were two nice like sixties
[inaudible] 68 67 and we drove five

54
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:07,660
hours from one of the hardest prisons in
America called Huntington.

55
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,030
And I left there after spending two
years of my first two years in silence.

56
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,120
So if you opened your mouth,
they would come in and beat your head.

57
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:20,530
And so I was so glad to get in the car
cause my mom was waiting in my lawyer's

58
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:25,390
office cause they were gonna give me a
review of my trial because they withheld

59
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:28,720
so much evidence.
So I was eager to go to court and it was

60
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:33,721
the coldest day of 1985 February 15th we
stop at a gas station and in Exton,

61
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:37,000
Pennsylvania.

62
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,230
And as I got out of the car,
the officer driving,

63
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:45,130
pull past the cubicles.
Now we all got out of the car and ran

64
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:49,930
over to the cubicle together and I went
in to start a peon and an is holding the

65
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:53,080
door for me and my eyeglasses start
fogging up.

66
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,620
You know what I mean?
Cause you go from the freezing cold to

67
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:58,180
warm to the cold,
your eyeglasses.

68
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,260
So all I know is I turned around and I
come out and he has the door like that

69
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:06,130
and I put my head down,
go under his arm and I turned left and

70
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:08,650
go back to the car.
And the dude smoking a cigarette,

71
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:11,650
doesn't know that his partner,
when the cubicle,

72
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,190
the pis and as I'm running back to the
duty,

73
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,890
pulls his pistol out and point blank
shoots at me,

74
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,010
Joe like Paul.
And as it went past my face,

75
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,510
I was like,
Oh shit,

76
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,050
I hit the ground,
I ran and he's following me with the

77
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:26,320
gun.

78
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,450
I could feel it like,
um,

79
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,590
like I was waiting from the blast me,
you know,

80
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,650
cause he thought it overpowered his
partner.

81
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,210
Oh he doesn't know his testimony at
trial was I turned around,

82
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,280
Nick's running at me and my partners
down are gone.

83
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,970
I pulled my gun and he runs and I,
I wasn't going to let a death row

84
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:44,920
prisoner run.
So I've tried to stop him.

85
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:47,680
I shot.
So I run around the corner,

86
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,380
I hit the ground,
I ripped all the skin off my hands.

87
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,700
I've run around the corner and I fly
towards this restaurant and there's all

88
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:58,810
these people innocently eaten dinner and
I'm running right towards the plate

89
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:00,610
glass window cause he ain't going to
blast me,

90
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:03,430
you know.
And I ran like I knew he couldn't shoot.

91
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:06,790
And then I shot around the corner and I
ran down to a gas station.

92
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,470
I tried to steal a car that didn't work.
Then I ran like 400 yards,

93
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,090
400 yards,
400 yards,

94
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,810
and I hid behind the car.
I just escaped from and I was laying in

95
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:19,950
the weeds behind the gas station,
about 50 yards from a muddy road

96
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,880
screaming,
who was the bigger idiot for letting

97
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:23,530
this happen?
And I was thinking,

98
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,940
oh my God,
like what am I doing?

99
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,140
What do I do,
Joe?

100
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:28,300
What?
Like how do I just jump up and say,

101
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:29,560
wait a minute,
it was a mistake.

102
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:31,330
You know that he already tried to shoot
me in the face,

103
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,110
right?
So I go high behind the police station.

104
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,880
Next four hours I'll have my God,
I'm Jeanne paid,

105
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:41,881
chased by a helicopter and he chases me
and he pins me and he chases me.

106
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,080
And I was so fit that I ran for four
hours through the woods without care,

107
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,970
with the branches did to my face or
nothing.

108
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,430
Man,
I blew out both quads.

109
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:53,110
I did my,
my hamstrings.

110
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,890
I ripped my feet open.
I ran so hard in terror that I didn't

111
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,733
care,
man.

112
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,400
And I got away and I,
I made it all way to Florida and I was

113
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:02,660
going to lead the country,
you notice?

114
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:04,520
And I said,
I got to go back.

115
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:07,040
How did you get to Florida?
I stole a dude's wallet,

116
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,620
New York,
and I got on an airplane and I went down

117
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:13,060
to Florida and I tried to rob a drug
dealer and I tried to do just,

118
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,350
I was sitting there,
I was so angry.

119
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:17,180
I was going to kill myself.
I was on,

120
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,920
uh,
I'll never forget this day.

121
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,300
I didn't want my folks to see me in
prison.

122
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,440
Handcuffs no more,
you know,

123
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,820
so I was going by a raft and it's going
to go on the ocean and I was going to

124
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,190
have one last party,
but all the foods that I loved,

125
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,430
then I was going to stab the raft,
wait for the sharks,

126
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,720
have to cut my wrist,
you know,

127
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,670
and then it was going to cap myself and
go.

128
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,021
Then I said,
no,

129
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:41,990
I'm going back.
So I turned myself back in.

130
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,280
They put me on death row in Florida and
I went back and I faced it,

131
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,220
you know,
say beat me for four minutes,

132
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:50,510
man.
They broke my face,

133
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,510
broke my back,
crushed me,

134
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:57,860
man,
tortured me and I thought I'm to get you

135
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,300
back,
you know,

136
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:03,200
for all the days you made me go in a
cage and beat some other prisoner while

137
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,880
you stood there with a club laughing at
me,

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,180
I'm going to get you back.
I'm going to make sure I started being a

139
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:09,110
loving person again.

140
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,150
So I'm sitting there in 1985 1986 with a
105 years plus the death penalty.

141
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,430
And I decided,
fuck this,

142
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,630
I'm going to be a nice guy.
So I started to learn,

143
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,670
okay,
I suffer from Aphasia.

144
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,580
I had my head beaten him with a rock.
So what is Aphasia?

145
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,600
Aphasia can be identified simply in
people who have stuttering disorder.

146
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Their brain and their of vernacular
abilities are distorted by disruption in

147
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,570
their brain.
Either their brain is functioning too

148
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:47,030
fast or their mouth is functioning too
fast,

149
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:52,031
or there's a combination of the two
misfiring and Aphasia can be through

150
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:57,560
trauma or through genetics.
And Aphasia affected my life so much as

151
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,930
a young person,
I never had the respect to listen to

152
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:02,900
people because I couldn't function.
I couldn't articulate,

153
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:06,380
I couldn't speak when I was at trial,
people spoke words that I didn't

154
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:10,610
understand and it frustrated me.
And when I tried to speak and I

155
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:12,320
stuttered,
people would be like that.

156
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,610
Uh,
C'mon retard.

157
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:18,611
When he got to say so after that beaton
where they beat me for four minutes and

158
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:24,161
he broke my face,
I began practicing speaking to myself.

159
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,540
Every day I learn new words and I taught
myself how to correctly articulate that

160
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:37,781
word into a sentence beautifully from my
own self and myself every day.

161
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:44,790
And then I became very,
very good at writing.

162
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,250
I began helping other prisoners.
I became the most dangerous prisoner

163
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:52,130
that they held because I cared about
other men.

164
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,070
I wrote to their mothers.
I wrote letters to their lawyers.

165
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,830
I gave up opportunities for people to
write books about me so I could help

166
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:01,890
another innocent man.
I did all those things because that's

167
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:03,810
how I got back at him for night.
They did to me.

168
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,250
So in 1988 I'm sitting in my cell and I
read about Dna and I knew right then I

169
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,840
could prove my innocence.
So I was the first man in America in

170
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:19,620
February of 1988 to ask for DNA testing
to prove my innocence.

171
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,620
And he threw away out hot tubs and
material.

172
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,590
And when I discover new evidence,
they destroyed that.

173
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,910
And his woman who came to meet me and
start visiting me fell in love with me

174
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:33,480
and she believed in me.
So she stood by me and told me that she

175
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:38,481
would be with me either to the gallows
walk or to the Moma approved medicines.

176
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,210
And for nine years she stood by me,
you know.

177
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,200
And finally we found some evidence that
was testable in 1995 what?

178
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,160
What was the evidence?
It was sperm from the rape and it was

179
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:56,160
being sent out here to California,
to Dr. Edward Blake.

180
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,280
And it broke open and transport and
spilled.

181
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,130
So Jackie left me,
had nothing left,

182
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,420
and then they put me in a special unit
and it started torturing me.

183
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,810
I keep this part quiet.
I never told a story.

184
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,920
It would ruin what happened if you're a
13 it's now out on Netflix,

185
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,600
but they finally closed down the old
prison I was in for 12 years,

186
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,350
where the average rate of survival is
only five and I was wanting hard as Jews

187
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:29,184
there and I made it.

188
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,400
They closed the prison down and open up
green county,

189
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:35,160
Super Max.
And the courts ordered that every

190
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:38,040
prisoner in Pennsylvania be loud out of
their cell for eight hours.

191
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,940
The administration looked at each other
it fuck that.

192
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,280
Not the crazy cannibals and not to
serial killers,

193
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,100
not the dudes that have been assault and
rape and each other.

194
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,330
So they picked 48 if it us out and they
put us in Pittsburgh and a special

195
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,400
penitentiary setting in which we were in
a sealed unit and they put all these

196
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:58,950
guards in there.
They weren't allowed to touch other

197
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:02,190
prisoners because they're so violent and
told them that we're giving you the

198
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,860
craziest of the crazy.
You know,

199
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,650
Buffalo Bill from silence of the land
was a real man,

200
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:09,780
right?
His name was Gary Hide Nick.

201
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,960
He abducted black women in Philadelphia
and put them in a pit under his house

202
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:15,960
and fed one of them to the other
survivors because he was building a

203
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:16,830
master race.

204
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,240
He was my neighbor man,
like so they started torturing us and

205
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:23,730
doing all this psychological crazy shit
to his word.

206
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:25,920
They were feeding us to each other like
wolves.

207
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,550
So I kept it all quiet until this year
when,

208
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,250
once again,
misfortune fell on my life and I

209
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:34,860
released monsters a madman,
the new book that I was going to give

210
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,700
you today,
and I thought,

211
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,790
you know,
I got to tell that story,

212
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,910
you know?
But it's been so hard to come back from

213
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:42,900
these moments,
Joe.

214
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:47,901
It's just like I look at what they did
to me and how I went to that moment

215
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,120
where the DNA is gone,
Jackie leaves me.

216
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,110
And so I find that I'm dying from
Hepatitis C that they did learn.

217
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,180
They infected me of it when they broke
my teeth when they beat me.

218
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,770
So I asked to be executed.
I said,

219
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,500
I studied all the world's religions.
I read over 9,000 books.

220
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,920
I did everything in piety.
My mother asked me to do,

221
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,090
I don't want a guy like they'll carter
did with the cards,

222
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,310
come into his cell and taunting them,
you know,

223
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,620
teasing him and listen to a man scream
in agony because the pile in his belly

224
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,830
is killing them.
So I wrote to the courts and I asked to

225
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:34,380
be executed.
I said,

226
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:35,214
fuck it man.

227
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,530
I want to die as a man.
I love who can respect himself.

228
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:43,810
Yeah.

229
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,280
The court intervened in order to DNA
testing that was going to be done on

230
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:53,281
evidence is spelled
July of 2003 the DNA test come back and

231
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,960
he proved innocent.
How did so the,

232
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,490
the dea evidence spilled and they just
captured it.

233
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:03,850
Once it spill,
it was in a box with all this evidence.

234
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,840
And Dr. Edward Blake who did the Oj
Simpson trial DNA,

235
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,990
said that there would be challenges to
it if he did the DNA in 1999 1998 and

236
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:18,181
2003 they had advanced mitochondrial DNA
separation so well that he felt

237
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:22,060
confident in his results.
So the federal court got involved and

238
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:22,894
said,
look,

239
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,320
I don't want to have this man executed.
I want the DNA done.

240
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,740
So they did that and it was amazing that
on the day that I called the lawyers,

241
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,730
they revealed the truth to me.
I called his lawyer and I'm like,

242
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:37,180
what's up?

243
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,013
He goes,
nick,

244
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,740
we got DNA from three separate sources
that prove you're innocent.

245
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,920
I said,
that's amazing,

246
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:46,320
Mike.
I,

247
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,740
I'm,
I'm really grateful.

248
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,940
He goes,
you know,

249
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,450
we used to tell people you're crazy that
we never believed in you.

250
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,290
I'm really sorry for that.
I'm like,

251
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,980
man,
really?

252
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,250
You want to take away my joy now,
man.

253
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,300
So I was really downcast at the day.
I called my mother,

254
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,880
my brother,
Mikey was having a seizure at her feet

255
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:10,660
cause he was an alcoholic after he fell
off a roof and he died shortly after.

256
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:14,920
So
he just went fucking crazy from there.

257
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,980
They take me off death row and they put
me in a psychological cell and they tell

258
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:25,771
me they can't trust me,
that no human being who has had done to

259
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:30,400
them what we've done to.
You cannot be angry that we open this

260
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:33,250
door up and we let you out.
You're going to get us.

261
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,220
So we're going to leave you until the
day they let you out.

262
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,090
We're going to leave you in this cell
because we don't trust you not to kill

263
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:42,430
us for what we did to you.
What did they do to you?

264
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,750
He to have the thing called gladiator
day,

265
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,990
so to lieutenant will be off on a
Sunday.

266
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,430
And the guards who started to come from
the Philadelphia area were black.

267
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,600
Nadian liked the guards up in the
hillbillies,

268
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,590
beaten on black prisoners.
So a weird thing happened where this

269
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,450
lieutenant came up with an idea,
we'll look,

270
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,710
let's let the prisoners get this
frustration outta you guys buy you pick

271
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:11,600
out the biggest guy and you pick out
this guy.

272
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,400
So one day I'm sitting there minding my
own business and they open up my cell

273
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:18,770
and there's four of them were clubs
Europe.

274
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,120
So I got to go in the cage and I got to
go and hurt somebody while they stand

275
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,440
outside.
And if you don't fight,

276
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:26,930
they're going to come in and they're
going to be worse than you can beat a

277
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:28,400
man or get beaten by one man.

278
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,523
Yeah.

279
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,100
So they did all this for their
entertainment.

280
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,750
Would they ever punished for this?
Not until after the riot on one of them

281
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:43,130
testified against the others for the
murder and stuff.

282
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,993
Okay.

283
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,820
I've watched the 11 people commit
suicide.

284
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,030
I've been stabbed,
strangled,

285
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,650
beaten,
senseless.

286
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,630
The cards used to talk because I was a
qs.

287
00:15:57,631 --> 00:16:01,420
If a psychological murder of going out
and stock and his poor woman,

288
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:04,510
because she looked like my girlfriend,
they said I was never treated like a

289
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:07,390
prisoner.
I was treated with deference.

290
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,920
The worst word I know in English
dictionary do we I was treated was so

291
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:16,921
harsh that it was cruel beyond cruel and
yet all I wanted to do was have enough

292
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,060
within me to learn to beautifully
speaks.

293
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:26,560
It didn't on a date at the executed me.
I could tell them how much I cared about

294
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:27,394
myself.

295
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,130
Yeah.

296
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,490
I was more important to me than living
because

297
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,010
somehow when you suffer like I've
suffered,

298
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,560
your head cracks open and you have this
hyper sensitivity to life

299
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,070
so that when you touch the human beings,
you never forget the 14 years no one was

300
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:53,220
allowed to touch you.
You know what?

301
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,690
Fuck this.
I ain't crying no more.

302
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,043
It's all right,
man.

303
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,170
There's nothing wrong with crying.
I just thought about it.

304
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,990
You know what Joe?
I do because I feel better for the whole

305
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:06,420
shit you shouldn't feel because I look
in your arms and your eyes and I see the

306
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:08,050
hurt that I'm causing you for doing.
No,

307
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:08,461
no,
no.

308
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,510
Don't worry about that,
man.

309
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,850
All right,
well this is what I know I'm doing is

310
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:15,150
trying to imagine what your life has
been like.

311
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:19,830
Don't you worry about me at all?
I'm harder than life and I'm kinder than

312
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,693
love.

313
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,740
Secretly.
I'm a saint.

314
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,110
It never hurt no one.
I try my best to be played every day and

315
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:33,111
I've had misfortune and I return
and a very sorry that I sit in this

316
00:17:34,591 --> 00:17:39,591
chair today after it came about.
You see,

317
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,200
I believe in good.
I believe good is going to when Joe and

318
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:50,970
uh,
I believe that I had again and was three

319
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:53,520
years again when years ago when I met my
wife,

320
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,610
current wife Laura.
See,

321
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,950
I had a woman in my life before that
used me and left me here in Los Angeles.

322
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,810
I ended up homeless on the streets here
and I was actually living up in this

323
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:08,960
area on the streets because my good
friend Noah,

324
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,080
lives around here.
Him and Jason took care of me and my bad

325
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:16,380
times I call it.
So I go back to England,

326
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,780
I meet this woman,
fall in love.

327
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,300
We have a baby and she's born on your
birthday.

328
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,240
And I start to believe in hope again.
I go do a podcast and England with my

329
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:31,320
good friend Brian from Chew Jordy.
And I start to spread my message again

330
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:34,200
and I want to get all these young kids
to believe in themselves.

331
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,610
And then one day I put the baby down for
a nap and I get Laura to lay in my arms

332
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:45,360
because she's sick and we'd get up 20
minutes later and the baby's dead and

333
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:47,400
I'm coming down the steps with the bed
dead baby.

334
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,560
And um,
you know,

335
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,550
all fucked up again.
And then people are so cruel that in the

336
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:55,410
village they started,
you know,

337
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,830
maybe the baby was killed by the guy on
death row when all this shit.

338
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,160
And I have a stalker ex wife,
Karen,

339
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:06,120
who just won't leave me alone,
contacts to police and tells him that I

340
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:10,020
put out a tweet that I,
and it only happened because my good

341
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:12,360
friend Anthony Simon Don,
he was in the green room,

342
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,310
told me the day before my daughter died
about have good close friend of his,

343
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,410
they lost a baby that day.

344
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,850
And so when our baby died,
I put out a tweet to saying,

345
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:26,460
you know,
appreciate the people in your life cause

346
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:29,730
they're so precious.
And the police came to our house and

347
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:33,960
humiliated me and wanted to know how I
could tweet about something because my

348
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:38,310
clock was nine hours off because I was
living on the streets of Los Angeles and

349
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:42,480
my time was still on la time.
Cause the anthony and I are developing a

350
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:46,950
major motion picture about my life.
And I told the police,

351
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:51,630
what are you crazy?
Like why would I so I can't even get a

352
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:53,900
break on the death of my daughter like
the,

353
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,900
that was the moment that the director of
the film fear of 13 decided to rip me

354
00:19:57,901 --> 00:20:00,760
off for my rights to the film.
Um,

355
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,460
I decided to rip you off how he owed me
50,000 pounds from doing the film.

356
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,460
Fear of 30 decided to rip you off
because he thought you killed your baby.

357
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,340
Now he decided to rip me off and not pay
me my money.

358
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:13,830
When I asked him I needed money to bury
my daughter.

359
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,480
So I end up in a shouting match with
authored the Moelis,

360
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,300
the billionaire from Boston.
I promised to get on his plane and come

361
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:25,150
kick his ass over the money.
We're arguing over cause I begged I,

362
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,600
it was crazy.
I ended up,

363
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,820
I'm still confused.
What?

364
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,090
So your child dies,
is it my child dies and everything goes

365
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:35,160
badly on syndrome.
Yes.

366
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,940
And everybody that I counted on to have
my back,

367
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,100
including director David Sinkton who
promised to pay me for my participation

368
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:46,650
in the film all then tell me,
well no,

369
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,370
I'm not paying you.
And I'm like,

370
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:51,280
how can you do this when I need this
money to bury my baby?

371
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,610
Why did he say it wasn't paying?
Cause he said he didn't owe it to me and

372
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:55,361
all this.
I said,

373
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:56,200
boy,
are you crazy?

374
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:57,970
You,
you have a written contract.

375
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,940
So it's the same thing.
You know how that entertainment

376
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:03,400
businesses,
once they get what they get out of you,

377
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:06,740
that's it.
So he just said he wasn't going to pay

378
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,700
you what the contract said.
Right.

379
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,940
So author demaurice invested in the film
and he owns most of it.

380
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,910
So I write to author,
I call myself author.

381
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,610
David's not paying me my money,
can you help me?

382
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,130
Cause he owned most of the film by that
point.

383
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,980
So author gets all annoyed at me.
I said,

384
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:25,600
look man,
my daughter just died.

385
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,190
I blew up at him.
I told them,

386
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,650
send me your private jet or come to
Boston,

387
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:32,350
we can have a fist fight.
You love to fight and all that shit.

388
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,760
I just lose control.
And then author out of His grace sends

389
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:40,420
me some money so we could bury the baby.
But it went through all this terrible

390
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:41,440
shit.
So I started,

391
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,120
I said,
now I'm going back to America.

392
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,560
So I leave England,
I come over here.

393
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:52,120
I got two daughters with Laura.
We go over here now and the Oregon and

394
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,190
Anthony,
my God,

395
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,550
I meet this amazing man only because of
Muhammad Ali dying.

396
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,180
And now he's going to help me make a
major motion picture about my life.

397
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,260
So I get away from all that trauma of
losing a baby and being humiliated by

398
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:07,720
people thinking I would do some shit to
a little girl.

399
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,580
And I go back and rebuild everything and
then I try to go to Canada and they

400
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,510
won't let me in as crazy,
so I can't go do my job there.

401
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:17,070
I lose all.

402
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,630
Don't let you in because you were on
death row for 22 years.

403
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,310
Yeah,
I know you're innocent.

404
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,790
Not only that,
I just came from speaking before the

405
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,030
United Nations sitting next to the
president and current former presidents

406
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:30,970
of Switzerland and I have a security
clearance from that.

407
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,770
I worked in a high profile job in
England going around speaking over to

408
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,950
governments,
but Canada holds it against me because I

409
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:42,330
escaped from death row,
so I can't enter the cat.

410
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,540
The country of Canada,
Robin Sharma tried to have me come up

411
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:50,130
there and speak for him with his
conference and I had the humiliating.

412
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:53,020
They do it from my home via skype.
It's like,

413
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,470
I'll never stop being punished for what
happened,

414
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,820
you know what I mean?
But I don't care about that.

415
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:00,880
What really bothered me,
it was that all those things started to

416
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,890
fall me and I started losing hope again.

417
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,710
So I go and I even tried recently just
to have a normal job and give up

418
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:09,544
everything.
I,

419
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,180
I'm a beautiful speaker in schools and I
go around and try and help people with

420
00:23:13,181 --> 00:23:14,800
their education.
Right?

421
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,200
So I was trying to do that the last year
with a,

422
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:20,500
a friend of mine named Wayne Sharp from
New Zealand.

423
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:24,250
He has a company called my verse and he
wants to help children find the correct

424
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:26,380
path.
Education so important.

425
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,440
We can't get that gone.
I can't,

426
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,310
I just decide I'm going to give up
everything and just go get a normal job.

427
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,790
But that doesn't work.
So I'm sitting there and it's Jamie's

428
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:41,560
birthday and I'm angry like,
what the fuck?

429
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,310
How could it fall apart again,
sit in,

430
00:23:45,311 --> 00:23:49,180
you contact me after I tweeted and it
all starts again.

431
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,220
I'm back to believe in that.
It doesn't matter how it got in his

432
00:23:54,221 --> 00:23:57,790
chair or it doesn't matter.
That demand proceeding me has everything

433
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,790
and I had nothing.
I still believe in

434
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,340
you this time and I told you now I
messed.

435
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,820
I sent,
yes it fucking Hell Joe,

436
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,080
you're going to change my life.
Doing is,

437
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:10,360
man,
you could have to do this.

438
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:12,070
You didn't have to be nice to me.

439
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,100
Yeah

440
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,170
you are.
And for that man,

441
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,970
I'm willing to keep going.

442
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,213
Cool.

443
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,580
I can't,
I mean I don't think anybody can imagine

444
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,620
what it's like to spend 22 years on
death row for something you didn't do.

445
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,670
I'm wanting you to go back to the night
that you got arrested and tell us cause

446
00:24:36,671 --> 00:24:37,504
you,
you kind of,

447
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,920
there's some tissue right?
Besides you if you want it.

448
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,783
Yeah,
I'm good.

449
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,860
I'm daughter crying.

450
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,023
Okay,

451
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,930
go ahead bro.
It's just the night you were,

452
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:53,230
how old were you were (202) 012-0120 I
turned 21 before he sentenced me to

453
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:56,150
death.
I'm 20 years old.

454
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,450
I'm a Philly kid and I'm high on meth
and the music's blasting drive into

455
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,990
chester,
Pennsylvania and the stolen car and

456
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,040
everything in my life is just chaos.
I'm fighting with my two brothers all

457
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:17,681
the time and no one has respect for me.
I was ugly and it's two o'clock in the

458
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:22,470
morning.
I just came from a bar.

459
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,190
I go through a stop sign and the next
thing I know,

460
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:29,270
I saw the lights,
I pull over and beating and my head's

461
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:33,860
out of control and I'm sitting there
gripped with fear.

462
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,530
I took a beat and Philly in December 4th
of that same year in which they ripped

463
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,230
all my teeth up.
Oh.

464
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:44,840
Would a blackjack.
So I was really scared,

465
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:45,620
you know,
I was like,

466
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,540
don't move.
Don't run.

467
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:50,330
Don't do nothing stupid.
You took a beating from cops earlier?

468
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,141
Yeah.
You know,

469
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:53,990
Philly cops put me in my place because I
ran my mouth.

470
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,483
So,

471
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,460
okay,

472
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,530
there I am sitting there and the next
thing I know,

473
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,030
bam on the window,
Bam.

474
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:06,031
And he rips open the door and uh,
attract from bad company was playing

475
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:11,380
really loud and he,
I can't hear any or make focus of what

476
00:26:11,381 --> 00:26:12,250
he's saying,
you know,

477
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,910
and then exiting or no,
boom,

478
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,400
right up out of the car.
And he's got me on the duckhorn and his

479
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:19,360
name is Benny,
right.

480
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,140
And he's six foot four and he's gotten
me pressed against the top of the car

481
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:24,790
and he's holding me down and I can't
breathe.

482
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:28,360
So I start resisting.
I popped his arm off and the adrenaline

483
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:29,470
goes,
boom,

484
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,730
here comes the beast out of me cause
it's six two and that age I was crazy

485
00:26:33,731 --> 00:26:36,760
tough man.
I was like off the charts and so I

486
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,830
pushed him back.
I remembered that and he couldn't

487
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:39,190
believe it.

488
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,290
He pulled out his stick and raised it up
and I just snatched it out of his and

489
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,940
chucked it away.
I was looking at him like,

490
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:46,440
I was like,
that's Zombie guy.

491
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,100
And he went furious many,
pulled out the pistol and I seen it

492
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:54,070
coming and I grabbed his hand and I
pushed down and I had my arms out

493
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:57,480
stretched and the gun whoop boom,
down into the ground like that.

494
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,590
I looked at him and he put the gun up
there and he's dead.

495
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,120
Motha fucking Wuss.
He puts me in a car.

496
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,490
I'm sitting in the backseat,
I'm freaking out.

497
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,520
You know,
he gets in the car and he's,

498
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,780
he's like jumping back and forth from
the front seat.

499
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,380
Then he waits and he looks at me in the
mirror and he grabs the mic and he's

500
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,440
going like shots fired officers.
This shots fired.

501
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,210
He looks at me one more last time he
goes,

502
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,260
help,
help,

503
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,830
help.
It could still going on and like,

504
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:23,441
um,
I'm like,

505
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,470
what?
Like what?

506
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,810
What's going on?
Dude tells them when they get there,

507
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,550
the backup officers get there.
He's like,

508
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,850
he tried to kill me.
He's got my gun and I got it back from

509
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,684
him.
I'm like,

510
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,230
no,
this is going south.

511
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,250
They jacked me up,
take me out of the car,

512
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,590
beat me down,
take me to jail.

513
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,730
Now I'm charged with attempted murder
and kidnapping of a police officer.

514
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,710
I'm 20 years old and I meet skipped
Dimatteo public defender who didn't

515
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,590
tells me I'm facing life imprisonment
and that's it,

516
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,320
and they're going to put me into
security wing because my bail is gonna

517
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:57,120
be so high.
I looked at him,

518
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:59,040
I said,
what do you mean man?

519
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,320
I was just trying home a minister one
car,

520
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:02,610
like he said,
no man,

521
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:07,670
you ain't never going home.
So I broke down and I went through detox

522
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:09,540
with note no help,
you know.

523
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:14,430
So three days I'm in a cell with nothing
but this newspaper.

524
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,450
And as the headline on the newspaper,
Mrs Craig's murder,

525
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:20,730
and it starts taunting me,
taunting me,

526
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,370
it's hot.
Somehow in my head,

527
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:28,690
I came up with this crazy mantra.
If I knew something about something that

528
00:28:28,691 --> 00:28:30,910
big up,
you can let me go about this lie.

529
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:36,810
I didn't try to kill nobody.
I was sitting on my bed and the guard

530
00:28:38,631 --> 00:28:41,150
was walking by and he goes,
what's wrong with you?

531
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,990
And I started telling him what was going
through my head,

532
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,630
the whole story.
And that was it,

533
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,130
Joe.
Oh my God.

534
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,650
He ran down the block.
He rented a sergeant's office.

535
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:55,870
They got me to the warden.
The warden's now been told to say,

536
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,600
you're telling them what's going on in
your head.

537
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,460
So I repeated it.
You had,

538
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,480
you had a plan to tell him a story,
to tell them a lie.

539
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,050
And when that officer responded because
he heard the story,

540
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,200
I didn't have any idea what the impact
of my words were.

541
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,450
I was so stupid.

542
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,020
Oh,
you were also going through detox?

543
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,460
Yeah.
And so they take me to the awards office

544
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:21,210
and he starts praising me.
They take me out of solitary

545
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:23,970
confinement.
Tell me I'm doing a great job.

546
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:29,460
What did you tell him?
I told him that a man that I knew in the

547
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:33,120
area had told me he had done the crime
and that if they let me out,

548
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,090
I would tell them all about it.
And he told me I was helping the

549
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:38,400
community.
They were taking me out of solitary

550
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,380
confinement and all that.
They told that,

551
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,300
uh,
they spoke to officer,

552
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:47,230
right and he was going to retract his
charges and only charged me resisting

553
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:50,710
arrest and they were going to drop the
rest of the charges and everything was

554
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:54,040
going to be good.
And then three days later they came back

555
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:54,970
and said,
dude,

556
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:58,000
you lied.
And the only reason you lied is because

557
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:01,900
you want to tell us that you did this.
They put me in a room and start doing

558
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:04,450
all this shot.
They find out that you lied to do did I

559
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:07,390
made the story up.
A was no longer a drug addict.

560
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:08,380
And he had an alibi.

561
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,940
So you just tried to pin the story on,
on some other drug addict they do to rob

562
00:30:14,941 --> 00:30:18,540
me a rolled me up in a rogue and tried
to kill me with a three 57 magnum.

563
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,650
So I figured,
I heard the story that he was dead and

564
00:30:22,651 --> 00:30:24,690
figure out he won't even find him
anyway,

565
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:27,420
you know.
But a 20 year old doesn't have any

566
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:28,860
concept of,
you know,

567
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,440
complex stuff like this,
especially in the 80s.

568
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:32,280
Right.
Dude,

569
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:35,400
they came right back to me and they had
me in a Delaware County district

570
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:40,290
attorney's office and this detective
Martin told me no certain terms.

571
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,480
I was gone tell him why I killed that
woman.

572
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,130
I wasn't leaving that room.
So for 13 hours they tortured me.

573
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:50,280
Matt started bringing up my childhood
and all that Shit.

574
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,043
I told him,
man,

575
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,650
I just wanted to blow up my whole world
like a Nasssa.

576
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,483
Oh,
that's good.

577
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,920
So this is my confession consists of,
um,

578
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,520
and I kill anyone.
I never meant to kill anyone.

579
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,680
That's good.
That's good.

580
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,590
You never meant to kill her.
What are you talking about?

581
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,600
So
I went to trial and I was given a three

582
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:17,601
day trial for the murder of Mrs. Craig
after the jury found me not guilty of

583
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:22,620
all my original charges.
So I was really frustrated that a jury

584
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:27,540
heard the testimony of officer right.
He would later be fired from the force,

585
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,750
uh,
being caught up in a drug gang and

586
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:31,590
chester,
he was dirty.

587
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,570
Uh,
but they didn't know that at the time.

588
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,930
But a jury found me not guilty.
That prosecutor,

589
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,750
my mental,
when that happened and he decided to

590
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:43,380
seek the death penalty.
So a month after I was found guilty,

591
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,060
not guilty of all my original charges
that I made the stupid story up.

592
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,610
I,
they gave me a three day murder trial.

593
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,900
That in essence was a joke.
And what they did was they prayed upon

594
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:59,100
the poor jury and showed them pictures
of the victim and stuff like that,

595
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:02,130
man.
And they had an inmate who burglarized

596
00:32:02,131 --> 00:32:05,970
the prosecutors home and was facing 20
years come into court and say,

597
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:07,740
I confessed to him.
That was it.

598
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,530
So the inmates so that you confessed to
him,

599
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,080
Charles Catalina,
they got to got to do that.

600
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,580
Yup.
So I'm sitting there and they dropped a

601
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:19,830
bomb on me.
I know it's coming.

602
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,880
The jury was so crest at,
they went out to the wagon wheel

603
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:27,990
restaurant and put their dessert order
on hold while they found me guilty.

604
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,740
And then during the sentencing phase
they had their dessert.

605
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,510
Yeah,

606
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,740
I was 20 years old,
man.

607
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,710
I'm like,
this isn't real man.

608
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,610
I never killed a this woman.
How can this happen?

609
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:44,480
You know?
And then Yoni mistake I truly think I

610
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:47,720
made was that I told the judge go to
hell when he sentenced me to death

611
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,620
because he couldn't look me in the face.
Why do you think that's a mistake?

612
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,470
Because he decided to send me to
Huntington prison.

613
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,650
The hardest prison in America at that
time wasn't going to do before that,

614
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,770
I don't know.
But he made sure I went to the place

615
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,060
that they broke.
You see,

616
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:04,880
Huntington was designed as the prison.
If he raped another inmate,

617
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:07,520
they sent you there.
It was the first shoe program in

618
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:10,030
America.
It was the first really what does shoot

619
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:12,950
program?
A special housing unit or security

620
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:15,980
housing unit were s level five supermax,
you know,

621
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,910
like Pelican Bay.

622
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,920
And uh,
your punishment was that you weren't

623
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:25,400
allowed to speak in yourself and if you
got caught speaking in yourself,

624
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,000
they came in with a nurse and they,
after they beat you down,

625
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,930
she jabbed you in the ass with thorazine
and they knocked you off for a week and

626
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:36,080
you lost your mind.
So it was horrible.

627
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,750
Like I told you the first two years of
my sentence,

628
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,100
every day I kept my mouth shut.
I didn't care what was done around me.

629
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:48,110
And you weren't allowed to say a God
damn word and a minute and you know,

630
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:50,420
a lot of talk to other inmates.
Nothing.

631
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,760
I day to sing happy birthday to yourself
like I did.

632
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,800
I paid for that one.
They fucked me up,

633
00:34:01,091 --> 00:34:02,830
Joe.
But I don't care about that.

634
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Look,
I realized I was in a race.

635
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,900
I had to kill off the person that I was.
The person that I initially was upon

636
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,780
entering prison was a deceitful,
lying,

637
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:22,670
coward,
but know fortitude because no self

638
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:27,400
respect resided within me
and in utter humbleness,

639
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,870
I took everything that they did to me
and I paid for every window.

640
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:34,490
I broke everything I stole,
rely at all,

641
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,070
and then I started to love myself.
I figured I ain't get nothing out of

642
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:43,150
this but misery.
So I'm going out like the dude.

643
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,400
I'm a stand up and not misspeak
beautifully on the daily to execute me.

644
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,370
I'm a walk to that walk,
man.

645
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,070
I'm a Judas.
I didn't kill that woman,

646
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:59,071
but I damn sure ain't no coward.
I'm going to find out everything I can

647
00:34:59,651 --> 00:35:03,430
about life and then I'm gonna face my
death.

648
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,610
I'm a do.
It was [inaudible] man,

649
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:11,160
like I had this beautiful,
beautiful speech ready for him too.

650
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,400
I was going to lay it out and just be at
peace because I realized there was

651
00:35:15,401 --> 00:35:19,360
nothing else to do.
I could fight.

652
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,480
I couldn't argue.
It didn't matter because God's in

653
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:25,240
control of my life and I really believed
that I had a choice,

654
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:30,690
either be a bitter pill and get sucked
dry by all the misery of mountain me or

655
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:33,550
get my shit right and start loving
myself.

656
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,340
So I taught myself how to speak and
overcome this,

657
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,330
uh,
Aphasia.

658
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:45,090
It affected me my whole life and I found
out that I was giving myself

659
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:50,070
neuro-plasticity healing and I became
very graceful and calm and prison.

660
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,540
I was so serene and so powerful.
How'd you find out you were giving

661
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:58,350
yourself neuroplasticity healing?
I found that out from Robin Sharma,

662
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,580
Robin Sharma's,
the foremost authority on speaking about

663
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:06,240
neuroplasticity healing.
And when he found about what I speak

664
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:07,680
about,
he said,

665
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:10,200
I am the living embodiment of his
teachings.

666
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,310
That through grace and dignity and
kindness,

667
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,940
I've developed my own charisma that
carries me with confidence.

668
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,360
And that is the description of what he
teaches professionals,

669
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:24,060
beginners,
everyone to explain neuroplasticity for

670
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:28,710
people to neuroplasticity is a reward
system within your brain where in your

671
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:31,530
interactions,
especially with other human beings,

672
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:35,790
heals you.
So people who suffer from PTSD,

673
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:40,590
people who have had trauma in their
lives can actually heal themselves by

674
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:45,591
being meticulously polite.
And I began all of this when I was

675
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:50,910
released.
My mother sat me down and she said,

676
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Nikki listened to me.
For you to get out of prison and not be

677
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,890
a nice man is a waste of everyone's
time.

678
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,460
Every prayer,
every time someone called me to mother

679
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:05,220
of monster,
every time a woman's spit in my face,

680
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,960
every thing that I went through is a
waste of time for you not to be a nice

681
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:11,870
man.

682
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:16,870
So I want you to promise me one thing
every day I want you to go out and say,

683
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:19,410
yes ma'am.
Yes sir.

684
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:24,090
And thank you because I want you to show
respect for who you are and that way

685
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,900
they hurt this family badly.
It's the only thing I ask.

686
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,630
I didn't notice.
She handed me the tool to healing

687
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,200
because neuroplasticity is the self
contrived act of rewarding yourself for

688
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:42,921
being a nice person.
And my gift over the last 14 years is

689
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:48,351
that I made myself so amazingly pliable
and gifted at helping others find the

690
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:53,880
good within them.
That's the reason I'm truly here today.

691
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,740
The thing that I've been able to
accomplish through my writing and

692
00:37:58,741 --> 00:38:03,741
through my efforts is to show people
that you take things personally in life,

693
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,280
you'd be then a full,
because what you've done is you've taken

694
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,660
all the hurts and you've made them to
justify reason why you have to be an

695
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,860
asshole to somebody.

696
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,810
Whereas you keep forgetting that you've
been given a break over and over just to

697
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,830
be here,
man.

698
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,690
Dude,
I've been shot,

699
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:22,590
stabbed,
strangled,

700
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,890
run over by a car,
hung myself in prison to drug overdoses

701
00:38:25,891 --> 00:38:28,770
and I had accountable trying to murder
me for two solid years.

702
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:34,770
I know that I could fall at any moment
from my own hand,

703
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:39,550
but God blessed me.
I believe so much in my purpose in life

704
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:44,050
that I won't kill myself.
I won't give up and it's only because

705
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,220
I've been tested that I know that it has
to be for a reason.

706
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:53,680
I had dreams about all this while I was
in death row.

707
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,550
I had the most amazing,
intense dreams because of my suffering

708
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,000
and they play out now.
So what happened?

709
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:04,720
Did I manage to touch something we're
all chasing.

710
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:08,490
Where am I in a delusional world?
Because I,

711
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,340
what do you mean by that?

712
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,090
I told people last June,
last year,

713
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:18,091
I told everybody on facebook something
was going to bag was going to happen and

714
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:23,371
it did when my daughter broke her elbow.
So I told everybody before it happened

715
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,200
two years ago,
I told my wife Laura,

716
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,100
I was coming back here to meet Anthony.
So I'm on Donnie and go on the good news

717
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,920
network and do a thing with Mei,
Mei Ali,

718
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:37,921
who's a good friend of mine and I told
him how things would happen and sure

719
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,940
enough,
every time it's played out I,

720
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,330
why did you think something was going to
bad was going to happen when you said

721
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:48,430
something bad was going to happen,
your daughter broke her arm.

722
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,920
Dude,
I'm in a meeting with a guy named Kevin

723
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,530
and John and I look at them and I say,
I have to,

724
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,330
and I'm on Melrose Boulevard.
My daughter is playing in the playground

725
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,890
a few blocks away and I'm in this
meeting with these men about my film.

726
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,740
I stand up at the table and I say to
them,

727
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:10,540
I have to go right now.
I run outside and I asked my wife,

728
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,920
Laura,
is she okay?

729
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,930
My daughter fell and broke her elbow and
had to have six pins put into it and

730
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:20,470
Cedars Sinai,
we have a $63,000 bill did.

731
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,830
It is stuck us with,
but I knew it was going to happen before

732
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:26,260
it did and I even told people it was
going to happen.

733
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,700
How can I have that touch?
Did you knew that was going to happen

734
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:32,830
specifically?
I saw the event,

735
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,670
but not in real time so I could make
sense of it,

736
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,210
but I saw the greenery at the park when
we pulled up,

737
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,010
it was the same and I had the flash last
night when I met Stedman Graham.

738
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,040
I had all these moments,
that woman last night pinned the thing

739
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:52,660
on my collar and she looked just like my
mother and I had this dream because my

740
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:55,810
mom died on September 9th and 10 years
ago.

741
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:00,810
I was actually on a flight September 11
for her funeral and it's all crazy how I

742
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:06,700
saw all these things in my dreams on
death row and they play out and it keeps

743
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:11,701
happening with witnesses to my life that
are recognizing it with me so I can't

744
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:13,840
make it up.
Do you know what I mean?

745
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,010
I wish my friend Jason was here.
He's,

746
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,890
he's been able to help me just put this
in context and I'm doing this badly,

747
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:25,891
but I just think that somehow I went
through an experience so intense that it

748
00:41:26,471 --> 00:41:30,220
is truly cracked open.
Something that has given me a

749
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:35,221
hypersensitivity to things.
I think that it is allowed me truly to

750
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:40,871
be humble enough to really give my life
for a purpose and not be ego driven.

751
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:44,060
Like I have nothing at this moment where
we sit here,

752
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,440
but I am so proud of the fact that that
doesn't never stop me from believing in

753
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:51,920
good
and you could beat me all day.

754
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,890
You could put in a cage,
you could do whatever you want to me,

755
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,200
but it's up to me that didn't make it
misery.

756
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,450
I'm choosing not to men.
I don't care how much I got a struggle

757
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:05,420
from this point on or what grace is,
and granted,

758
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,950
I just want one thing to stay true in my
life that I don't lose who I am.

759
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:15,340
I fought so hard to be this man through
a childhood of a feeling so inadequate

760
00:42:16,461 --> 00:42:21,461
because another man raped me to the
feelings that I was so low of being cast

761
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:27,011
aside as a condemned human being that
then rise up and go and speak before

762
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:30,580
governments.
To the point that Kofi Annan told me

763
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:35,030
that I was one of the finest speakers in
the world to then go and follow that and

764
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:38,900
stand at the base of the Coliseum where
human beings were put to death for

765
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:43,910
entertainment and blow 20,000 people
away and have it flawlessly done.

766
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,520
And to recognize that I had it all
within me to do because of one thing

767
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,640
that neuroplasticity came me.
Charisma,

768
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:57,410
the kind of charisma you exude.
So I don't know where it is that you hit

769
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:00,230
that point where you decided to really
believe in yourself,

770
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,260
but like you said,
you didn't listen to that shit that

771
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:06,110
people were telling you.
And once you did that,

772
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:09,830
you started to contrive all this
beautiful charisma because I didn't even

773
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:11,930
watch the fight Saturday when you were
talking,

774
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,800
I listened to you and I thought he so
flawless.

775
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,430
It's not even thought of,
but people would never grant you that

776
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:24,200
you dad to do something in your heart,
something within you made you believe in

777
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:24,740
this guy,

778
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,910
man was I,
I have not had much resistance at all.

779
00:43:27,911 --> 00:43:29,890
I'm going to be honest with you,
like what you're,

780
00:43:29,891 --> 00:43:32,350
what you're saying about me is very
kind.

781
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,710
I really appreciate it,
but really haven't had much resistance.

782
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,450
Yeah.
But what it is about you that makes you

783
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:39,440
believe in yourself.
Yeah.

784
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,650
What happened?
Where'd you hit that point?

785
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,860
Well,
I'm pretty sure it came from martial

786
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:47,720
arts,
from martial arts competition when I was

787
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:51,240
very young,
pretty sure from the first,

788
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,290
the first,
when neither neither.

789
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,700
Just,
um,

790
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:59,090
just how difficult it was.
Just,

791
00:43:59,091 --> 00:43:59,924
um,
um,

792
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,580
doing it from 15 to,
uh,

793
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,840
uh,
before I was 22,

794
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:10,490
I stopped somewhere around 22,
but there's just the fact that it was so

795
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:12,290
difficult that it,
uh,

796
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,950
it taught me hard work,
taught me focus and,

797
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,860
and uh,
I didn't have anything before that

798
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:22,250
before that I thought it was a loser,
like a really thought it was a loser.

799
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,540
I don't know.
My father,

800
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,090
um,
my Stepdad's a very nice guy,

801
00:44:26,091 --> 00:44:31,091
but there's something about growing up
without a father that is still alive,

802
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,620
that doesn't talk to you.
And you know,

803
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:36,960
my mom worked all day.
My stepdad worked all day.

804
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:39,060
There was no one around,
you know,

805
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:40,990
I just,
uh,

806
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,900
and we moved a lot of,
didn't have any friends.

807
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,640
So I just,
I just,

808
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:48,570
um,
I never felt like I was worthwhile,

809
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,180
but that's what I wasn't anything like
what you experienced?

810
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:55,560
Nothing.
But it was enough within you that it was

811
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,540
the point where I needed to prove
myself.

812
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,970
That's what I need.
I wanted to show,

813
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:00,361
I,
I,

814
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:04,260
there was something inside me that I
needed to show that it wasn't useless

815
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,110
and the only way I could show that it
wasn't useless was by being good at

816
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:09,210
things.
And initially it was art.

817
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,690
And then after art it became,
martial arts in the martial arts thing

818
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:16,050
was more important than art because the
martial arts tested me.

819
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:20,220
Like art was beautiful because I could
draw things and people would love them.

820
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,890
And then it made me feel good that
people liked my work.

821
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,780
But it was,
there's a big difference between that

822
00:45:24,781 --> 00:45:25,650
and the martial arts.

823
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,520
The martial arts was so difficult to do
and to compete at a,

824
00:45:30,521 --> 00:45:31,890
you know,
a national level,

825
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,660
it was,
um,

826
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,740
every time I did it I was terrified.
But after it was over,

827
00:45:37,741 --> 00:45:40,830
I felt better about myself and I
understood that I could actually be good

828
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:42,450
at things.
So it was the first thing that I ever

829
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:47,451
did that gave me a feeling of of value.
So I went from being a loser to being an

830
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:50,610
extreme winter.
That's brilliant.

831
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,160
But it was just,
it is.

832
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,350
But is your point though,
but you're saying that people like held

833
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:58,380
me back and that's not really the case.
It wasn't,

834
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,310
you know,
I mean I'm sure people judged me one way

835
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:04,680
or another because of fear factor,
some of the other things.

836
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:09,450
But the thing about going through the
martial arts competition and everything,

837
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:10,284
when I was young,
I don't,

838
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,690
I don't give a fuck how other people
view me.

839
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,870
I don't,
I just do what I like.

840
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,260
I do what I like and I try to be nice.
But that's where your charisma comes

841
00:46:19,261 --> 00:46:22,200
from and where you got that from,
it's still yours,

842
00:46:22,201 --> 00:46:23,610
man.
I admired it.

843
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,070
A lot of people don't have the
confidence to do that,

844
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,900
to shut it off.
That noise,

845
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,740
that thing that makes us all react to
every one else's opinion.

846
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,060
Well I react to it.
I mean,

847
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:33,261
I,
I'm,

848
00:46:33,261 --> 00:46:35,460
I'm most certainly feel it,
but I just don't,

849
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,220
don't,
I don't let it change the way I,

850
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,190
I go through life.
And,

851
00:46:41,191 --> 00:46:44,130
uh,
I think because of the lessons that I've

852
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:46,830
learned,
I try to express that as much as

853
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:50,640
possible for people that haven't gone
through those same lessons.

854
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,410
So I can,
I can,

855
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:57,740
I can express that information and maybe
people can absorb some of it without

856
00:46:57,811 --> 00:46:59,340
having to go through what I went
through.

857
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:04,440
I think what you went through is
infinitely more difficult,

858
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:09,530
more trying.
And I think that your message and your

859
00:47:10,051 --> 00:47:15,051
story can show people that in the worst
possible scenario,

860
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:20,901
the beginning of your life as a man,
you're wrongfully committed to life in

861
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:26,760
prison.
You are going to spend the rest of your

862
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:31,300
life until they execute you on death row
and all the horrors that you've gone

863
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:36,280
through to come out of that and to come
out of that with a purpose of being a

864
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:41,200
nice person and learning how to speak
and learning how to speak clearly and

865
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:43,890
confidently.
Like there's a lesson in that that said,

866
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:47,410
I mean,
I mean this is almost like at a,

867
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:54,040
at a religious level.
I mean you talk about someone who's

868
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,770
created a diamond from pressure.
I mean that's what you've done well,

869
00:47:57,771 --> 00:48:00,520
you've done is you've,
you've figured out a way to,

870
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:04,810
despite all this raging hurricane of
emotion that goes through your mind,

871
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:07,450
that's caused you to cry when you think
about these things,

872
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:13,380
you can express yourself in a very clear
way that lets people,

873
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:18,841
it just at least peer through the window
into what you've experienced in your

874
00:48:19,511 --> 00:48:21,790
life and it,
it,

875
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,500
it can give people a perspective that
there just is very,

876
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:30,910
very rare that someone gets fucked over
in life as bad as you did.

877
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:34,720
Very,
very rare and it's even more rare to

878
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:36,820
come through at the end with a sense of
purpose

879
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,940
everyday of my life.
Someone writes me and tells me they

880
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:43,300
didn't kill themselves today.
Did you know that every day man,

881
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,490
did he stop drugs?
There's a young man living in my house

882
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:51,010
named Zach curves is a really good
friend of mine.

883
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:54,360
He really changed his whole life since
meeting me.

884
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,140
Uh,
even my close friends have told me I've

885
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:04,141
changed their life and I appreciate it
because I recognize a lot of times it's

886
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:11,371
the good within then that's resonating
and I'm proud of the fact that I have

887
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,880
sat and listened to the words I kind of
deserve for what I've tried and I'm

888
00:49:19,931 --> 00:49:23,470
going to learn in the future to accept
the graces that you just did to me.

889
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,500
Because in the past I always tried to,
as you see,

890
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:30,010
diminish it.
I have worked very hard,

891
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:32,860
Joe.
I have worked very hard to craft,

892
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,100
um,
my work into writing and like your

893
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:36,934
drawings.

894
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:42,030
I was so proud of having a number one
bestseller in my first book and I was so

895
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:47,680
proud of using my talent as a writer to
then articulate what it's like to lose a

896
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:50,350
baby and my journey through her eyes or
to use,

897
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,570
uh,
this last effort in monsters,

898
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:54,880
a med men too,
to help people.

899
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:58,180
It's okay to have a bigger secret than
the one that people know you by and

900
00:49:58,181 --> 00:50:00,670
still live with it.
And then when it's right,

901
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:03,790
you can share it.
Or I've made a point that I'm done

902
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:07,870
writing because I've accomplished all my
work as a writer and now I want to do

903
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:08,890
one thing.
Well,

904
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,030
I want to help young students around the
world take them so seriously with their

905
00:50:13,031 --> 00:50:17,290
education.
I did over 500 of them in schools over

906
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:19,780
England and Europe and stuff.
I loved it,

907
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:23,380
man.
I got all these young lads and lasses to

908
00:50:23,381 --> 00:50:27,680
come back to me and show me degrees that
they got when I showed him important are

909
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:29,210
education was.
And I,

910
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,420
I really thrive in that.
And Yeah,

911
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,150
environment because I think that's where
everything's still is for me.

912
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:40,170
Somehow.
Like I'm a kid,

913
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:43,890
you know,
who won't let go of needing to still

914
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,590
chase the good in my life.

915
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,280
And I notice things in the woods and I
know there's a billion things in the

916
00:50:52,381 --> 00:50:55,230
woods,
but I'm still willing to walk that path

917
00:50:55,231 --> 00:50:58,680
and find something meaningful.
And that's what I came here to really

918
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:03,681
say is that I want to make an impact
with my words,

919
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:07,800
but not overdo it.
So I don't want to do,

920
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,310
uh,
any other podcast after this one except

921
00:51:11,311 --> 00:51:14,460
for my friend Brian's.
But I wanted to,

922
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:19,790
the meaningful thing without it having
to be attached to the social media draw

923
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:24,090
that has hurt my life.
So much

924
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,250
social media draw that has hurt your
life.

925
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:27,690
How has it hurt you live?
Well,

926
00:51:27,691 --> 00:51:30,840
when my daughter broke her arm and we
put up a go fund me page,

927
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:34,680
I was viciously attack because people
expect me to have funds but they don't

928
00:51:34,681 --> 00:51:35,610
know,
you know,

929
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,310
things need to have funds because of the
movie and the book.

930
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,350
And I'm not,
I have nothing.

931
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,490
I borrowed money to get here.
Like people don't know that I'm wearing

932
00:51:44,491 --> 00:51:48,210
a shirt from my friend because he funded
me to be here,

933
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,830
you know,
so I'd have food while I was here.

934
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,180
It's like that real,
you know,

935
00:51:51,181 --> 00:51:56,181
so people don't want me to not succeed.
Like I hurt third image of me if I don't

936
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:02,100
have wealth in addition to being this
person before them.

937
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,720
Well,
I just think people just,

938
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,430
they don't understand,
you know,

939
00:52:05,431 --> 00:52:10,230
the people see someone else's life and
they like to assume the worst and they

940
00:52:10,231 --> 00:52:13,020
like to criticize you whenever they have
an opportunity.

941
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:18,020
So if they see any vulnerability,
they pounce and you know what you've

942
00:52:18,331 --> 00:52:21,690
gone through is the opposite of what
most people go through.

943
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,050
People have difficult times in their
life but more than difficult times.

944
00:52:25,051 --> 00:52:29,730
You know what they have.
They have long periods where they don't

945
00:52:29,731 --> 00:52:34,731
have anything happen,
where life is boring and life is just a

946
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:39,971
dull gray and life is just work and
coming home from work and the trials and

947
00:52:41,011 --> 00:52:46,011
tribulations of that and traffic and the
kind of insane experiences that you had

948
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:53,600
being wrongly convicted and spending 22
years confined in a cage forced to fight

949
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:01,970
because of vicious psychopath guards
that those kinds of experiences or the

950
00:53:03,331 --> 00:53:05,700
experiences that allowed you to come out
of it.

951
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:11,510
This very kind,
very open minded person who's trying to

952
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,650
better yourself and wants to see the
best in other people,

953
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,040
the people that go through their life
and this dull state of jealousy and

954
00:53:22,681 --> 00:53:27,681
bitterness and resentment.
And just constantly focused on

955
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:32,400
themselves as self obsessive culture
that we have.

956
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,940
And one of the things about social media
that's most fucked up is you're looking

957
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:40,380
at all these other people's lives and
shedding on them and comparing yourself

958
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:45,381
to them and finding faults in them and
attacking them in the comments section

959
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:49,170
and attacking what the,
and the people that are doing that,

960
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:50,550
they're all doing that because they're
in,

961
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,610
they're in agony during a different kind
of agony than you.

962
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,100
But it's an agony of nothing.

963
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:58,480
I know.
And I looked at it and I thought,

964
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,730
I try to craft a beautiful message on
the social medias so that I don't get

965
00:54:03,731 --> 00:54:06,510
caught up in arguments.
And I always try to show the good dude

966
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:09,100
in the world.
And that's why I love like the good news

967
00:54:09,101 --> 00:54:11,710
network.
I'll try and deliberately stay away from

968
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,860
things that poisoned my mind cause I
don't want to contribute.

969
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,400
I don't want to get caught up in the
trump era argument or the previous

970
00:54:18,401 --> 00:54:22,120
argument or the new argument.
I want to post meaningful messages of

971
00:54:22,121 --> 00:54:26,320
good because that's my overall message.
So I thought recently maybe I can

972
00:54:26,321 --> 00:54:29,290
contrive three beautiful messages for
twitter,

973
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:30,490
facebook,
and Instagram,

974
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:34,180
and I could leave out this wonderful
message and then I can go about my

975
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:38,350
business of going back into schools and
talking to students because it gets too

976
00:54:38,351 --> 00:54:40,270
chaotic.
Um,

977
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,810
in addition to all the lovely messages
of the,

978
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:47,080
uh,
wonderful human beings that listened to

979
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,810
me speak,
or they saw the film fear of 13,

980
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,350
read one of my books,
there's also a lot of women out there,

981
00:54:53,351 --> 00:54:55,600
men,
and they'd been harassing me and

982
00:54:55,601 --> 00:54:58,720
bothering me.
And it's put a lot of conflict in my

983
00:54:58,721 --> 00:55:02,410
life and I don't want that harass you
and bothering you.

984
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:05,200
How a lot of women fall in love because
of the film.

985
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,050
The film made me look very attractive.
What is it about

986
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,060
women and men that are on death row?

987
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,570
There's the one too.
Yeah,

988
00:55:11,571 --> 00:55:12,530
I know.
So to it.

989
00:55:12,531 --> 00:55:14,090
Yeah.
They'll contact me and tell me about

990
00:55:14,091 --> 00:55:15,890
their inmate.
I'm not an inmate,

991
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:18,290
I'm not a death row prisoner.
I was on death row.

992
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,520
That is a strange obsession that some
women have it.

993
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:25,460
And it goes to a psychological feature
of women,

994
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:28,100
uh,
who can fix things with their loan.

995
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,330
So they want me to deceive my wife,
to be with them,

996
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:36,320
but not be deceitful.
They want me to ignore all the social

997
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:38,930
chaos I could cause to go and leave a
family to be with them,

998
00:55:38,931 --> 00:55:42,410
but they still want to harass me.
And it was so bad recently,

999
00:55:42,411 --> 00:55:45,080
even on my anniversary,
I had to cut off the people who were

1000
00:55:45,081 --> 00:55:46,820
bothering me.
I have a,

1001
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,710
uh,
an act of stalker in my life.

1002
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,240
Uh,
it's all kinds of crazy.

1003
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,580
Uh,
I've gone through a lot of experiences

1004
00:55:52,581 --> 00:55:54,530
where the social media is really tested
me.

1005
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,870
So I thought I'm going to try and be
like the dude.

1006
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,050
All right,
so they're going to execute me said that

1007
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,910
twice the day.
The dude is the guy that knows art.

1008
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:04,700
So this is my last scene.
You mean like from the Big Lebowski?

1009
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:09,260
Kind of like the dude man,
like the dude so seriously.

1010
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,230
Jeff Bridges one of my heroes.
What a moment.

1011
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,240
You know Chris Pine,
Jeff Bridges,

1012
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:18,380
Ben Foster being interviewed about hell
and high water and a asked Chris Pine,

1013
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:19,550
what do you watch?
And he goes,

1014
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,580
oh my God,
I got to tell you about fear of 13.

1015
00:56:22,581 --> 00:56:23,980
I've got to tell you,
Nikki Iris,

1016
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,810
man,
this dude is the shit.

1017
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,550
You know what I mean?
And my phone goes,

1018
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,140
yeah,
I had dinner with him.

1019
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:31,330
He so really,
really cool dude man.

1020
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,460
Wow.
You need to have Chris on.

1021
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:37,210
He's a really cool dude.
He really introspective and he's deep

1022
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,350
like he's a real good conversationalist.

1023
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,970
I soak time.
W w what else has he been in?

1024
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,860
All these bullies image up.
Oh Dude,

1025
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:49,000
he just a blanket on him.
He just did the one word oprah too.

1026
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:52,720
And he did the one before that with the
Star Trek.

1027
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,500
Oh,
that Guy Chris and wonder woman.

1028
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:59,140
Yeah.
It's just as great on telling you,

1029
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:01,810
man,
what are any a to invite me to dinner

1030
00:57:01,811 --> 00:57:05,260
and hang out with him.
And even Harvey Weinstein pops in for a

1031
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,093
minute.
Holla.

1032
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,030
I'm like,
no.

1033
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:09,160
And he's like,
Harvey,

1034
00:57:09,161 --> 00:57:12,190
you just produced that documentary.
But the dude that was in jail or

1035
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:14,920
everything hit the fan.
This is before things went tits up.

1036
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,850
I know.
I had this real great blessing.

1037
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:21,130
So Alejandro Monte Verde,
uh,

1038
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,620
who did the little boy with a Kevin
James,

1039
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:27,230
he has an amazing life story himself.
I mean his,

1040
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,310
his family was abducted by the
kidnappers and executed.

1041
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:31,810
This is real drama.

1042
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,240
The day I meet this man,
I'm at a red carpet event in La and he

1043
00:57:37,241 --> 00:57:41,920
goes home and watches fear of 13,
and he comes back and he tells me,

1044
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,100
I'm going to make your movie.
I'm going to help you.

1045
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:48,370
I don't know how,
but God told me there's certain movies

1046
00:57:48,371 --> 00:57:50,800
that have to make.
And he's making one right now with Tim

1047
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,270
Ballard from the CIA about um,
rescuing children from the sex trades

1048
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,310
and stuff.
So he's doing really serious work.

1049
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:58,720
You know what I mean?
So make a feature.

1050
00:57:58,721 --> 00:58:02,110
Films that are going to make a feature
film about me called conviction right

1051
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,100
now,
it might be changed,

1052
00:58:03,101 --> 00:58:05,230
but I got the script and it's fucking
hard,

1053
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:08,140
man to read.
But we have all these a list actors.

1054
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:11,050
And my dream of course was Chris Pine.
Cause I think he's one of the best.

1055
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:12,400
Right?
But I have no say.

1056
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:17,350
But I get this amazing chance to come
out here and meet all these people for

1057
00:58:17,351 --> 00:58:21,730
the film being made.
And I realize it's all meant to beam and

1058
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:26,731
like all this crazy stuff.
So maybe if I craft my message right,

1059
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:31,060
I can step back and let people
appreciate the message I had without

1060
00:58:31,061 --> 00:58:33,250
distorting it.
Cause I don't want to ruin it.

1061
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:38,730
I don't want to go too far and end up
making a fool of myself when I thought

1062
00:58:38,861 --> 00:58:42,910
the right thing to do was teach people
about neuroplasticity and how to make

1063
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:47,270
yourself a really bad ass outside the
ring by being a kind man and how to

1064
00:58:47,271 --> 00:58:50,980
rarely make yourself a really nice
person to the family and loved ones by

1065
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:55,480
having the self respect about yourself,
to be patient in life and things like

1066
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:56,314
that.
You know,

1067
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,840
and don't ruin it.
So that's what I,

1068
00:58:58,841 --> 00:59:00,850
you keep saying don't ruin it.
You know,

1069
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:03,700
when you're talking about social media,
I think one thing to take into

1070
00:59:03,701 --> 00:59:07,360
consideration is when you do something
like a go fund me or any,

1071
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:12,220
anytime there's anything controversial,
those are magnets for hate and you might

1072
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:15,700
think that everyone hates you,
but what you're dealing with is a very

1073
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:20,690
small amount of people from a very large
amount of people that,

1074
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,100
sir,
if you thinking about the whole

1075
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:22,791
planet,
right,

1076
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:27,140
and all the English speaking people,
you're dealing with hundreds and

1077
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,150
hundreds of millions of people that can
achieve so much in what you said.

1078
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,090
That's why I'm here now because on my
website,

1079
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,870
[inaudible] dot org we organized so
today's listeners can go there and

1080
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:39,710
download copies of my book.
I can get out of destitute times.

1081
00:59:39,711 --> 00:59:43,220
I can get my life together.
We did everything we could knowing that

1082
00:59:43,221 --> 00:59:44,870
this podcast is reaching a million
people.

1083
00:59:44,871 --> 00:59:46,280
So you're right.
I do.

1084
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:50,000
I mean even you like your social media.
What I mean is just the thing is to not

1085
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:54,410
get caught up in the numbers that come
at you that are negative because it's

1086
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:57,320
just a sheer matter of volume,
right?

1087
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,450
If you're reaching people through the
Internet,

1088
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,810
you're reaching,
who knows how many human beings.

1089
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:08,140
I think one out of a hundred is going to
be the type of person that wants to send

1090
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:11,600
a hateful message because it's easy
because they don't have to look you in

1091
01:00:11,601 --> 01:00:12,650
the eyes when they do it.

1092
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:16,040
They don't have to feel any social
consequences.

1093
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:19,910
They don't have to feel your pain when
they insult you or,

1094
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,070
or you know,
say awful things,

1095
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:24,950
but you or your family,
they're doing it because they want to

1096
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:28,340
affect you because they're hurting and
they're hurting for a very different

1097
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:32,330
reason than the way you're hurting.
But this is what's wrong with social

1098
01:00:32,331 --> 01:00:36,170
media is because human beings are not
meant to communicate that way.

1099
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:41,290
We lose our humanity in this very
shallow form of interaction because all

1100
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:45,800
those parts,
what's what's important about people's

1101
01:00:45,801 --> 01:00:48,020
looking them in the eyes,
talking to them,

1102
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:50,090
hugging them,
shaking their hand,

1103
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:55,070
communicating honestly and anytime you
you're missing any of those pieces.

1104
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,400
When you communicate dishonesty,
when you don't want to shake someone's

1105
01:00:58,401 --> 01:00:59,540
hand,
when you don't want to look them in the

1106
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:00,950
eye,
when you don't want to enter in your

1107
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:01,784
interact with them.

1108
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,590
When you don't care about them as a
person,

1109
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:08,000
all those things leave you feeling like
shit and all those.

1110
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,230
That's true.
You're right.

1111
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:13,940
The social media is the worst form of it
because it's just text.

1112
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:17,200
You have to interpret it yourself.
You don't know what the fuck is going on

1113
01:01:17,201 --> 01:01:18,830
in their life.
You don't know who they are,

1114
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,340
but you read that text and you absorb it
personally.

1115
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,640
You absorb a personally,
you take it in the worst possible form

1116
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:29,570
and you,
you feel that critique in your chest,

1117
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,430
you feel it,
you feel it in your head.

1118
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,710
And now I guess I got caught up in this
notion that

1119
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,900
I could just copy a normal guy and have
a normal job and people would leave me

1120
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:40,490
alone.
Well,

1121
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,630
they would if you weren't on social
media and uh,

1122
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:46,610
I,
I've already entered that form so you

1123
01:01:46,611 --> 01:01:47,960
don't have to stay in that form.

1124
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,250
But it's true.
But here's the thing.

1125
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:51,710
Even if you do use that form,
you know what you can do.

1126
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:54,560
You just don't interact.
You Sal is,

1127
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:55,970
that's the thing.
That's what I said.

1128
01:01:55,971 --> 01:01:59,030
I was on it too.
It's hard for people to understand that

1129
01:01:59,031 --> 01:01:59,990
are on the outside.
They're like,

1130
01:01:59,991 --> 01:02:00,741
well,
you asked all,

1131
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:03,200
I love you.
I want you to interact with me because I

1132
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:04,400
love you.
You know,

1133
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:08,540
and I want you to recognize that I'm
recognizing you and I appreciate that

1134
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:10,640
from people,
but they have to understand the volume

1135
01:02:10,641 --> 01:02:12,560
of people that someone like you is
dealing with.

1136
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:15,350
That's what I tried to convey.
And I try very sincerely,

1137
01:02:15,351 --> 01:02:18,170
never to be ignorant to people.
And you know,

1138
01:02:18,171 --> 01:02:19,990
it's,
it's fucking mind blowing joke.

1139
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:24,300
Cause I had my mind made up and now I've
realized that I do.

1140
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:28,200
And it all goes back to a conversation.
What were boy Jason Daily?

1141
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,120
Me and him were driving along the four
five one day in a film for it.

1142
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:35,730
Fear of 13 is about to come out.
And I told him I didn't want it to come

1143
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:39,000
out and he said,
you don't own that film.

1144
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:43,290
Every kid that's ever had a shitty
childhood owns that film.

1145
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,910
Everybody who's got a broken marriage or
a shitty lifers really struggling owns

1146
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:49,650
that film.
If you fuck this up,

1147
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:53,280
I'll never be your friend again man.
And he was right.

1148
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,170
I don't own the fear of 13 and I don't
own really anything of it,

1149
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:02,670
but it's message is so beautiful.
I did what I could to tell my story

1150
01:03:02,671 --> 01:03:05,670
because we're all living our life as an
experience,

1151
01:03:05,671 --> 01:03:07,620
but we can only convey it as a memory.

1152
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:11,850
And I did beautifully for myself and I'm
so proud of the effort I made.

1153
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,550
I don't care that the director rob me,
I'll make my way.

1154
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:18,630
I don't care what I went through to this
moment because I truly appreciate the

1155
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:23,280
person who wrote me last night and said,
two weeks ago I was released from a

1156
01:03:23,281 --> 01:03:25,350
mental hospital after trying to kill
myself.

1157
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:29,910
And my mom sat me down and made me watch
film now,

1158
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,850
and the last two weeks I've been going
to therapy and I'm getting my shit

1159
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:36,540
together.
I don't film Joe and I don't own my

1160
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:39,450
message.
I guess my message is taken on by the

1161
01:03:39,451 --> 01:03:42,120
people who love me or not.
You're right.

1162
01:03:42,121 --> 01:03:44,010
I'm not going to be bothered by the
negatives.

1163
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:48,120
I had a terrible experience with a
Stalker for 12 years who won't leave me

1164
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:51,600
alone in it cost me and my daughter in a
divorce,

1165
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,860
all kinds of crazy stuff.

1166
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:56,220
So it was really affecting me and my
current wife and I didn't like it,

1167
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:59,970
but I think I'm going to actually beat a
dude and just hang around for a little

1168
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:02,520
bit longer and make you proud of me for
what I do from heroin.

1169
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,050
Well,
don't worry about me man.

1170
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,740
Now everyone that I love as though to
always be on that list,

1171
01:04:07,741 --> 01:04:09,090
man,
I really,

1172
01:04:09,091 --> 01:04:13,200
that's what you use for motivation and
that's great and there's nothing wrong

1173
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:14,650
with that.
Um,

1174
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:19,710
but I think that what you can do and
what you are doing,

1175
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,190
it show that you can,
you can overcome things.

1176
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:27,030
You can overcome horrible things.
Some of the most horrible experiences a

1177
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:30,270
person could ever face.
You can overcome them and you have.

1178
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:34,560
And those messages,
they give people inspiration.

1179
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:37,770
And inspiration is one of the greatest
things you can give a person and her

1180
01:04:37,771 --> 01:04:39,540
that you inspiring me today.

1181
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,780
I told you since this man ever since we
started communicating,

1182
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:46,350
I told you I meanness.
I even went out of my way today to matt.

1183
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,540
Matt rang me,
your producer,

1184
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,810
and I wanted to make point right away.
I said,

1185
01:04:51,811 --> 01:04:53,910
dude,
I know a lot of people climb right past

1186
01:04:53,911 --> 01:04:56,100
you to go to Joe.
I wanted to tell you,

1187
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:59,850
thank you for helping me and my family.
Thank you for helping organize.

1188
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,890
I made sure that Jamie got my love when
I came in the room because he organized

1189
01:05:03,891 --> 01:05:06,990
my trip and it was so cool.
He got me into the right airport and

1190
01:05:06,991 --> 01:05:07,824
everything.
Right.

1191
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:12,980
Because I know that is so important to
that man because a lot of people make

1192
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:15,510
that effort Gel,
and I don't want to be that guy that

1193
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:17,800
misses my chance.
So I'm gonna thank you.

1194
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:18,940
And yes ma'am.
And yes,

1195
01:05:18,941 --> 01:05:19,960
sir,
to everyone,

1196
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:24,820
like my mom asked me and make sure never
to overlook people because that's truly

1197
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:25,654
my message.

1198
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:30,870
My kindness makes me able to come back.
My good heart is made better by the fact

1199
01:05:31,001 --> 01:05:35,200
that I want to believe in good.
And it's crazy how it's come back to

1200
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:37,690
reward me in so many ways.
Like,

1201
01:05:37,691 --> 01:05:40,060
do you remember when Muhammad Ali died?
Yeah.

1202
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,253
Yeah.
Well,

1203
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:45,190
I didn't know anthony some on Donnie.
I didn't know his story,

1204
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:50,820
but one day I get contacted by a man
who's seen the fear of 13 and I learned

1205
01:05:50,831 --> 01:05:54,280
that he went to university out here and
he became a lawyer because of a promise

1206
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:58,210
to his mother to be a good person.
He goes to the mosque every Friday and

1207
01:05:58,211 --> 01:06:02,500
becomes close friends with Mohamad a
Neko to dinner every night with Mei Mei

1208
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,370
on Fridays,
you know,

1209
01:06:03,371 --> 01:06:06,340
and he become real close.
And he tells me this story how at a

1210
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:08,620
young age,
Mohammed looks him in the face and says,

1211
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,920
you're going to be one of the men that
carries my message in life.

1212
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:16,180
And he's like,
I'm 22 what could I possibly have to

1213
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:20,710
offer anyone?
So he goes through this experience and

1214
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:25,570
on the date of Muhammad Ali had approval
from the government patent office for

1215
01:06:25,571 --> 01:06:28,240
this bracelet that says within good
there has god.

1216
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,840
He called me in England where I was the
time,

1217
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:34,330
and he says,
I have a question for you.

1218
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:38,380
I saw your film.
I learned a lot about you since then.

1219
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,900
Why aren't you bitter,
man?

1220
01:06:40,901 --> 01:06:44,020
Why are you still willing to believe?
And I said,

1221
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,600
my mother never prayed for anything but
good.

1222
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:50,530
She always told me that only good there
was was an was within God.

1223
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,680
He said,
are you kidding me?

1224
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,080
Hold on.
And he starts sending me this stuff.

1225
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:00,370
I didn't know that earlier that day.
Muhammad Ali's bracelet would be,

1226
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:02,050
you know,
approved by the Pat.

1227
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:05,020
I didn't know any of that,
but it was those words.

1228
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,660
You see what I mean about the
synchronicity of all this craziness of

1229
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:10,600
my life.
The next thing he know I'm and in Los

1230
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,220
Angeles,
a meeting Alejandro,

1231
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:16,390
he wants to help me make the movie.
I meet all these wonderful people like

1232
01:07:16,391 --> 01:07:19,690
Adam and from bottle keeper.
He's such a sweet guide.

1233
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:23,230
They came up with this company on the
beach a couple of years ago and now it's

1234
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:27,430
doing very well for keeping drinks cold
and he's done wonders for me and my

1235
01:07:27,431 --> 01:07:30,520
wife.
This man is such a lovely guy that I

1236
01:07:30,521 --> 01:07:33,790
wouldn't be in this chair without him.
We're anthony or any of these people.

1237
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:36,600
Right.
And then anthony sets up may,

1238
01:07:36,601 --> 01:07:41,440
may Ali,
and he brings me out and we have a pod

1239
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:46,510
cast and he doesn't tell her word about
me beforehand.

1240
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,880
Now.
What's crazy was I'm doing this

1241
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:55,990
interview right behind where I used to
sleep on the street and I think I kept a

1242
01:07:55,991 --> 01:07:58,150
lot of quiet,
did some of my best work when I was

1243
01:07:58,151 --> 01:08:01,510
homeless,
and I do this thing in May,

1244
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,500
May,
looks at me and says,

1245
01:08:02,501 --> 01:08:06,580
no disrespect to my father Muhammad Ali,
but you're one of the most influential

1246
01:08:06,581 --> 01:08:07,960
men I ever met my life.

1247
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,980
And within five minutes of meeting you,
I'm already changing things about my

1248
01:08:11,981 --> 01:08:14,590
life.
I decided right then,

1249
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,380
okay,
then I have to own that man I have to

1250
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:21,140
live at for her man.
Like I can never go back.

1251
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:26,270
I can't go back and be an average,
retarded,

1252
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,040
mindless,
angry person.

1253
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:31,340
I can't be caught up in the drama of
everyday stupid shit.

1254
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,860
Like I got an owe it to that girl,
you know?

1255
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,510
And I have ever since I met her,
she's one of the nicest people in my

1256
01:08:38,511 --> 01:08:39,344
life,
man.

1257
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:41,240
I have some amazing friends,
Joe.

1258
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:45,380
I really mean it manna.
And there's so many connections to your

1259
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:48,110
life you wouldn't even know,
dude,

1260
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:50,240
when people found out I was coming to
meet you.

1261
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,900
Every one of them said the same.
Pretty much the same thing.

1262
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:55,910
Joe.
Such a nice duty.

1263
01:08:55,911 --> 01:08:58,370
So intelligent.
I love listening to them.

1264
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,520
I work with educators on a platform
code,

1265
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:06,290
netplus they love your stem procast I
know people up in Waterbury,

1266
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:09,590
Connecticut that teach out of the self
defense class codes.

1267
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:12,650
Practical set defense third right now
going crazy.

1268
01:09:12,651 --> 01:09:17,270
Cause you know they know Joe Jesse,
I'm Kazak huskies on the first ballot

1269
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:18,830
tour card.
You know it and they,

1270
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:21,520
these guys are really crazy like Alex
core,

1271
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,550
Cortez and all them.
They're like joe is so next level.

1272
01:09:25,551 --> 01:09:30,551
I'm saying so are you psych joe showing
you to believe in yourself because he

1273
01:09:30,981 --> 01:09:34,940
didn't get there because he had like
been handed this shit.

1274
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,840
Like I remember reading stories about
you going to the MMA and just doing it

1275
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,050
so he could have drink money man.
Like the get free tickets and go in.

1276
01:09:42,051 --> 01:09:43,100
Right.
Yeah,

1277
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:44,840
that's true in it.
Yeah.

1278
01:09:44,841 --> 01:09:46,160
When I first started working for the
UFC,

1279
01:09:46,161 --> 01:09:47,900
I did the first if not for money.
Right.

1280
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,930
I did the first 15 shows for free.
For free.

1281
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,580
Yeah.
See what I mean?

1282
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:55,190
Well,
it was probably foolish financially.

1283
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,290
My manager didn't think it was a good
idea.

1284
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,580
I just didn't care.
I just,

1285
01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,713
I was enjoying it.

1286
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:02,180
That's what I love.
Like I,

1287
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:03,360
it's what I want to do,
man.

1288
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:04,740
I want to be the dude.
Man

1289
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:08,220
was also struggling company that I
believed in and I wanted to help him.

1290
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,980
But what,
what you're saying is interesting

1291
01:10:10,981 --> 01:10:13,710
because you have one theme that you keep
repeating,

1292
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:16,290
that you want to do things for other
people.

1293
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:19,460
He keeps saying that like you wanted to
do that from May.

1294
01:10:19,461 --> 01:10:23,940
May you wanted to make me proud.
This is a constant theme that you,

1295
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:27,840
you want,
you want to do good for other people.

1296
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:32,490
That's an amazing,
amazing mindset for someone who's been

1297
01:10:32,491 --> 01:10:34,290
through everything that you've been
through,

1298
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,670
that,
that sentiment,

1299
01:10:35,671 --> 01:10:38,130
that,
that and then your gratitude.

1300
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,470
That's another very,
very powerful thing.

1301
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:44,220
Gratitude,
love and gratitude are two of the most

1302
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:48,840
incredible expressions and some of the
most influential.

1303
01:10:48,841 --> 01:10:52,410
Because when you showed true gratitude
to people and true love to people,

1304
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:56,760
they feel that that affects the way they
interact with the rest of the people

1305
01:10:56,761 --> 01:10:58,050
that they're going to experience.

1306
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:01,980
Like if they run into a new person,
just moments after meeting you,

1307
01:11:01,981 --> 01:11:06,240
they will be nicer and they will,
they will feel that gratitude and feel

1308
01:11:06,241 --> 01:11:07,350
that love.
That's a real,

1309
01:11:07,351 --> 01:11:09,630
and that's one thing that we all can do.
You know,

1310
01:11:09,631 --> 01:11:12,180
this thought that we're all a powerless
and helpless.

1311
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:17,810
It's of the problems with there's this
society is that the society is so

1312
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:20,520
overwhelming.
We have so much information coming at

1313
01:11:20,521 --> 01:11:23,520
us.
And the message is that what's important

1314
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:24,570
is,
you know,

1315
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:29,571
beautiful girls with short skirts and
fast shiny cars and big giant houses and

1316
01:11:31,111 --> 01:11:36,111
private jets and diamond rings and
Expensive Watches and all this horse

1317
01:11:37,111 --> 01:11:39,630
shit.
And this is what people seek.

1318
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:44,190
They seek that instead of seeking love
and gratitude because it doesn't seem

1319
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:47,220
that that's important,
but that's way more important.

1320
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:49,890
It's everything because that literally
changes the world.

1321
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,110
It changes.
It's like,

1322
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,280
you know,
I always thought that that expression,

1323
01:11:53,281 --> 01:11:55,440
the wings of the butterfly eventually
become a hurricane.

1324
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,390
That's fucking stupid cause that doesn't
work that way.

1325
01:11:57,391 --> 01:12:00,900
A butterfly just generates a very small
amount of wind and they're small and it

1326
01:12:00,901 --> 01:12:04,080
doesn't really work that way,
but the idea behind it,

1327
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,040
what what it,
what it,

1328
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:10,150
what it represents as a metaphor is that
you literally buy your one person that

1329
01:12:14,701 --> 01:12:17,550
lives amongst 300 plus million people in
this country,

1330
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:22,320
one person with love and gratitude and
inspiration,

1331
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:28,160
especially the way you can express
yourself that affects people you come in

1332
01:12:28,201 --> 01:12:33,201
contact with and that in turn affects
the people they come in contact with and

1333
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:36,420
that literally can change the world and
actually could change the world.

1334
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:37,830
That's real necessity,
man.

1335
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,930
That's what I'm good at.
I know it.

1336
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:44,070
I've helped so many people heal their
lives when I've interacted with them and

1337
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:46,600
tense time.
I've made it.

1338
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:49,380
Let me stop you because this is one
thing that you said to me before the

1339
01:12:49,381 --> 01:12:51,450
podcast and you said it again during the
podcast.

1340
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,320
The only want to do this one podcast,
you don't want to say anymore.

1341
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:59,610
And I want to ask you why.
Because if you have this powerful

1342
01:12:59,611 --> 01:13:02,100
message,
the more people you reach and the more

1343
01:13:02,101 --> 01:13:04,330
you express yourself with this message,
you're not going to cheap.

1344
01:13:04,331 --> 01:13:07,050
And your message,
well you're going to do is you're going

1345
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:10,440
to get it out to more and more people.
And the more people that you can get out

1346
01:13:10,650 --> 01:13:13,410
your words and the way you express
yourself,

1347
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,920
that's going to affect people.
It's going to affect people in a very,

1348
01:13:16,921 --> 01:13:18,990
very positive way.
Okay?

1349
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,270
But the other side of that,
and no one can appreciate is that I'm

1350
01:13:24,271 --> 01:13:26,610
failed.
I haven't been able to get anything

1351
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:27,810
going.
I tried to start upon,

1352
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:28,171
no,
no,

1353
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:28,501
no,
no,

1354
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:29,251
no.
Let me,

1355
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:30,420
let me stop you.
Let me stop you.

1356
01:13:30,421 --> 01:13:32,220
You're not failed.
First of all,

1357
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:34,680
you've only been out of jail for 13
years.

1358
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:39,330
That's fucking crazy.
You were in jail for 22 years on death

1359
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:40,980
row.
There's not a whole lot of people get

1360
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:44,190
through that experience and can tie
their own fucking shoes after they're

1361
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,390
done.
You know,

1362
01:13:45,391 --> 01:13:45,870
you,
you,

1363
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:48,300
you're,
you have every right in the world to be

1364
01:13:48,301 --> 01:13:51,150
shell shocked and incapacitated.
You're not,

1365
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:56,580
it's hard to get things going that the
world does not open its doors for you

1366
01:13:56,581 --> 01:13:59,130
and success does not come easy.
It doesn't work that way.

1367
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:00,930
Okay?
So for you to say you failed,

1368
01:14:00,931 --> 01:14:02,910
you haven't failed.
You've already written books.

1369
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,430
You've already have a,
a documentary made about you.

1370
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:07,800
You're in,
in the process of making a feature

1371
01:14:07,801 --> 01:14:09,840
length film about your life.
That's not a failure.

1372
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,460
No,
I just failed getting the platforms

1373
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,980
together that I need and I guess

1374
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,000
failing,
it's just,

1375
01:14:16,001 --> 01:14:18,550
it doesn't always work out right the
first time.

1376
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:20,410
It's not,
it's not a failure.

1377
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:21,370
You're not a failure.

1378
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:22,920
Okay?
Then here's the deal for you,

1379
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:25,950
sir.
Prove your words right to me and come on

1380
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,860
when I get my shit together.
You come on my podcast.

1381
01:14:28,861 --> 01:14:30,720
When we finished the conversation,

1382
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:32,160
later on,
I would do that,

1383
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:34,470
but even if I didn't,
doesn't matter.

1384
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,170
You can do anything,
but wow,

1385
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,700
I just want to showed you,
you yourself,

1386
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:42,000
this idea that you're,
you've failed is crazy.

1387
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:43,800
It's you.
You have not failed.

1388
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,810
If you've done things.
First of all,

1389
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:52,070
everyone does things that don't succeed
and then you recalibrate and you adjust

1390
01:14:52,261 --> 01:14:55,830
and you try again.
No one succeeds and wins the world

1391
01:14:55,831 --> 01:14:59,970
championship in their first fight.
No one writes a book and without

1392
01:14:59,971 --> 01:15:03,420
learning English and without practicing
essays,

1393
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:05,760
that becomes the greatest book the
world's ever written,

1394
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,320
read,
written,

1395
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:08,690
whatever you,
you,

1396
01:15:08,691 --> 01:15:11,490
you,
you take time and you learn.

1397
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:16,790
This is what life is about.
Life is about this process and through

1398
01:15:16,831 --> 01:15:21,831
that process you find yourself through
the difficult tasks that you undertake,

1399
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:28,310
maybe adjust and you become better.
You said he started a podcast and you

1400
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:30,420
feel well,
how long did you do it for?

1401
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,030
I didn't never got off the ground.
No one believes in me.

1402
01:15:33,031 --> 01:15:35,180
And then I know,
I'm just saying,

1403
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,330
first of all,
the podcasts are easy,

1404
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:39,100
man.
What that phone you have right there?

1405
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:44,550
I'm sure that phone has a audio recorder
I've done by living my $11 phone

1406
01:15:45,821 --> 01:15:46,780
probably does.
Oh,

1407
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:48,550
they all do.
Every phone does.

1408
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,310
That's not $11 madness or regular
android phone.

1409
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:52,870
Right?
A good phone.

1410
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:57,970
It's one of these wafer these me.
And look,

1411
01:15:57,971 --> 01:16:02,140
if you had this phone fucking 10 years
ago that people think you are a wizard.

1412
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:02,920
Yeah,
man,

1413
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:04,510
if he were in the fifth century,
of course.

1414
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,940
Yeah.
Well that phone I'm sure has,

1415
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,270
you know you're kicking me into this,
right,

1416
01:16:09,271 --> 01:16:12,540
and I'm going to have to respond because
of the way I've always been wired.

1417
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:15,870
I'm going to do this.
Then I can do anything.

1418
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:17,131
No,
listen,

1419
01:16:17,131 --> 01:16:20,070
I am all right.
You need never again encouraged me,

1420
01:16:20,071 --> 01:16:20,904
sir.
Okay.

1421
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,840
If I go around doing that for others,
I have been rough on myself because I

1422
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:27,660
thought I'd have a platform and
accomplish the things that I wanted to

1423
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:30,960
and I felt really shitty that I wasn't
able to take care and provide for my

1424
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,490
family.
And that's the heart of it really was

1425
01:16:33,491 --> 01:16:36,180
the struggle and that side.
I wouldn't give a shit about fame.

1426
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,550
I've had the most amazing experiences of
my life,

1427
01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:40,860
man.
One of my first interviews was the

1428
01:16:40,861 --> 01:16:43,020
village voice and the woman learns me at
the end,

1429
01:16:43,021 --> 01:16:44,310
Jennifer Gonnerman's,
she says,

1430
01:16:44,311 --> 01:16:46,470
man,
you know you're living one of the

1431
01:16:46,471 --> 01:16:48,750
greatest stories ever told man,
this ain't no joke.

1432
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:51,690
And every time she's told me that words
in my head,

1433
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:56,280
I realized comes with a hell of a ride
in a price.

1434
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:59,190
So if I've got to own it,
I got to own all of it.

1435
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,380
I keep telling people to own it when you
do well.

1436
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:05,610
So maybe I needed to bounce back and
this is the day I stepped forward and

1437
01:17:05,611 --> 01:17:08,640
start kicking ass again.
And maybe that will get me out of those

1438
01:17:08,641 --> 01:17:12,410
tearful that I've had to go through.
What do you have every right to have a

1439
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:15,400
struggle?
I mean if anybody has any right to,

1440
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:18,950
to,
to have difficult emotions and a

1441
01:17:18,951 --> 01:17:22,010
difficulty expressing those emotions.
It's you.

1442
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:25,130
I,
and I understand how you could dwell on

1443
01:17:25,131 --> 01:17:29,030
things not succeeding the way you
anticipated one of them too.

1444
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:31,430
But he just kind of keep going,
man.

1445
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:32,840
You know,
I'm such a honest person.

1446
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,700
I could never come on here and fake it.
You know,

1447
01:17:34,701 --> 01:17:38,030
I could never do that for you man.
I thought that would be so insincere.

1448
01:17:38,031 --> 01:17:40,540
So I just came down here and I decided I
was,

1449
01:17:40,541 --> 01:17:43,030
cause it was poured out.
Honestly we did.

1450
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,970
And I feel like the best thing about it
is like jelly.

1451
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:49,610
Like you're so like me in so many ways
on the,

1452
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:51,260
on the download,
like you just,

1453
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:55,010
he's just want good.
Like you just want to have a purposeful

1454
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:58,640
message that you want to share and
that's what I thought was really cool.

1455
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,980
I had a really cool experience last
year.

1456
01:18:00,981 --> 01:18:05,930
I went to East Germany to speak before
company and I met all these Lebanese

1457
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:10,931
refugees after meeting navy seals.
The dude's on the plane love me man.

1458
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:14,600
I built them up for being part of our
military system.

1459
01:18:14,601 --> 01:18:17,180
I made them really respect and honor
themselves.

1460
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:22,190
Then I was on the streets of Berlin
hanging out with these Lebanese refugees

1461
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:25,790
and I made them feel so good about this
fact that they still believed in each

1462
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,240
other.
So I have some magical ability to go

1463
01:18:29,241 --> 01:18:34,241
around and touch different groups and my
message resonates with people who've

1464
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:37,550
been in the military or have been
through trauma or not been through

1465
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:39,380
trauma.
And I have a gift.

1466
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:44,410
I know it and I've spoken in some of the
most prestigious places and one of them

1467
01:18:44,691 --> 01:18:47,060
is still to this day,
one of the highest honors.

1468
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:52,160
I spoke at St John's church in London
where a ticket on the Vietnamese monk

1469
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:56,510
who marched with Martin Luther King in
Selma,

1470
01:18:56,511 --> 01:19:00,050
Alabama spoke,
and he used to be my pen pal on death

1471
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:02,450
row.
He was the first man that gave me

1472
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:06,470
respect when I was on death row and he
questioned why I didn't have respect a

1473
01:19:06,471 --> 01:19:08,120
lot like you're doing for me today.

1474
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:11,480
And he taught me to look at myself
differently.

1475
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:16,700
So I went through a whole one year
period of my experiences before I could

1476
01:19:16,701 --> 01:19:18,710
speak at that church.
And when I did,

1477
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:23,450
I was absolutely flawless because I knew
that my friend was there and he was

1478
01:19:23,451 --> 01:19:26,960
guiding me.
And somewhere within me I have some

1479
01:19:26,961 --> 01:19:29,480
magical ability.
I don't know where it comes from,

1480
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:34,481
but I have an order to skill.
And once I'm past these dark days,

1481
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:39,830
I'm sure I can lay it down well so that
I can carry a message beautifully to

1482
01:19:39,831 --> 01:19:44,831
educational fields purposefully into the
corporate fields or wherever I want to

1483
01:19:45,651 --> 01:19:50,120
go and I love it that I do have a
winning hand and I have a gift behind it

1484
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,060
that was earned,
not control yourself.

1485
01:19:53,061 --> 01:19:54,770
How to do this.
I mean think about what you were saying

1486
01:19:54,771 --> 01:19:57,680
earlier about learning how to speak so
that you could speak at your own

1487
01:19:57,681 --> 01:19:58,514
execution.

1488
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:01,550
That's why it's a powerful motivating
force.

1489
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:04,460
Yes sir.
And to learn all of the world's

1490
01:20:04,461 --> 01:20:08,250
religions so that you understood what it
means to speak.

1491
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:11,910
Do you know in the Sanskrit religion,
a lot of the words are used as

1492
01:20:11,911 --> 01:20:15,810
descriptive forms of things.
So chair isn't the object,

1493
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:20,250
it's the feeling of sitting.
So you have a responsibility and not

1494
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,860
only in the words that you choose to
speak,

1495
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:27,000
but in a manner that you deliver them
and the vibrations within you that you

1496
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:32,001
carrying leash share with another person
because there is a receptor within us

1497
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:37,230
all to the truth and it resonates and it
rises within us.

1498
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:42,560
And so I found that powerful ability to
talk to myself in that manner so that I

1499
01:20:43,441 --> 01:20:48,441
could love myself and I would stand in
the wouldn'to of my cell and talk to

1500
01:20:49,381 --> 01:20:54,381
myself or quote beautiful texts and I
loved reading the Prophet I Kahleel

1501
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:55,470
Goubran.

1502
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:59,880
I read it over 20 times because I
thought his message was so powerful

1503
01:20:59,881 --> 01:21:03,690
because he lost his entire family while
he wrote this book over a three year

1504
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:08,691
journey and although I might have come
back from the ashes like pg Carnahan and

1505
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:11,940
the man who beat would be king from
Roger Kipling,

1506
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:18,380
I still feel like I have a valid message
motivating me to go forward.

1507
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:24,230
And my idea from this wine on is I want
to go home to Laura and the kids and

1508
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:28,110
regroup,
get myself together and I know a lot of

1509
01:21:28,111 --> 01:21:31,590
people are going to contact me because
of your grace to have me on your show

1510
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:35,460
and what I plan to do over the next
couple of years,

1511
01:21:35,461 --> 01:21:40,461
Joe,
is I want to show myself not just user

1512
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:44,190
that I'm right.
Being a kind man.

1513
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:49,020
Being a goodhearted man,
being meticulously polite doesn't mean

1514
01:21:49,021 --> 01:21:51,780
you're a loser.
It doesn't mean you're a full and if

1515
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:55,110
people take advantage of you,
it's down to you to take it as an insult

1516
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:58,440
or rise the fuck up about the insult and
just move past it.

1517
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:03,900
The reason I'm not bitter is because I
didn't take it personal when they broke

1518
01:22:03,901 --> 01:22:06,420
my teeth and put me in death row and
tortured me.

1519
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:11,640
I didn't take it personal because right
now there are 2 million people

1520
01:22:11,641 --> 01:22:16,410
incarcerated in this country.
I didn't take it personal because 150

1521
01:22:16,411 --> 01:22:21,411
other men got off of death row.
That's why I'm able to function because

1522
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:25,020
I don't take life personally,
but I'd take love personally.

1523
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:27,600
I take it so personally to,
I'm willing to love myself.

1524
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:31,470
A lot of people can't do that.
Do you know how hard it is to get a

1525
01:22:31,471 --> 01:22:35,240
woman to look at herself without looking
at a fall they can't stand?

1526
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,060
Do you know how hard it is to get a man?
To be honest with his emotions,

1527
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,010
thinking that he's weak?
If he does,

1528
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,120
I would rather have tears on my face
walking down the street and frustration.

1529
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:48,030
Then just rip on somebody and hurt
somebody.

1530
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:53,040
That's the kind of caliber of level of
humanity I want to find them myself.

1531
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:55,770
And I think we all do.
And I think the message,

1532
01:22:55,771 --> 01:22:58,680
like you said,
has been distorted by the social media

1533
01:22:58,681 --> 01:23:02,900
so badly that we need more talking.
And I would all,

1534
01:23:02,901 --> 01:23:06,040
I would dream of having a late night
talk and

1535
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,740
play some of my calls,
music and talk to people,

1536
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:13,741
just average people and just open it up.
Like I want to just share what's good

1537
01:23:14,381 --> 01:23:19,381
about me because my mother was right.
Wouldn't have just been a terrible waste

1538
01:23:19,721 --> 01:23:22,930
of time if I got out of jail and I was
just another asshole on the street,

1539
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:25,600
it would,
you know,

1540
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:30,010
one of the things that keeps coming up
is you are longing for community.

1541
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:34,240
And this is something that I've been
thinking about a lot lately because I

1542
01:23:34,241 --> 01:23:38,620
think one of the things that people are
constantly searching for in this world

1543
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:40,570
is happiness,
right?

1544
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:45,760
So one thing that people don't have that
they wish they had that comes up over

1545
01:23:45,761 --> 01:23:50,020
and over again.
It's a reoccurring theme and one of the

1546
01:23:50,021 --> 01:23:54,430
things that's also a big part of this
life that we are all are living right

1547
01:23:54,431 --> 01:23:59,431
now is this very recent disconnect
between our neighbors,

1548
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:06,010
our friends,
by commuting to work and it's being

1549
01:24:06,011 --> 01:24:11,011
stuck in this stuffy environment where
you can express yourself normally and

1550
01:24:11,321 --> 01:24:13,870
this is the majority of your life,
the majority of your time.

1551
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:17,350
And then we wonder why we're sad and we
don't spend enough time together with

1552
01:24:17,351 --> 01:24:18,550
friends.
Here's,

1553
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:23,050
here's when you aren't sad.
When you're having fun with your friends

1554
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,480
because that's what human beings are
meant to do.

1555
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:27,910
There's some,
they're meant to work together to do

1556
01:24:27,911 --> 01:24:30,850
something together like something
meaningful core of your healing.

1557
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:34,570
It's meant we're meant to have community
or meant to have friends and we're meant

1558
01:24:34,571 --> 01:24:37,660
to laugh.
We'll meant to share experiences were

1559
01:24:37,661 --> 01:24:41,770
meant to care for each other and when
that's not happening in your life,

1560
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:46,090
you feel like shit.
What you're doing is spreading the

1561
01:24:46,091 --> 01:24:48,790
fingers of your community.
You're spreading the branches of your

1562
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:51,730
community by,
by expressing yourself and helping other

1563
01:24:51,731 --> 01:24:53,650
people,
by expressing yourself and inspiring

1564
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:56,530
other people by sending your message out
there.

1565
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:00,340
This is a type of community for people
that are longing for community.

1566
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:04,420
You're connecting with people,
people that are longing to feel a

1567
01:25:04,421 --> 01:25:05,254
connection.

1568
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,690
And this is,
this is something that's missing.

1569
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:10,420
Is this something that's greatly missing
in our society?

1570
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:15,930
And you,
you understand it more than most because

1571
01:25:16,421 --> 01:25:21,421
your time that they forced you to be
separate from community that they did.

1572
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,000
They gave you the opposite of community.
If you communicated,

1573
01:25:25,001 --> 01:25:27,400
they beat you up,
they gave you the opposite of the

1574
01:25:27,401 --> 01:25:29,200
community.
They locked you in a cage,

1575
01:25:29,201 --> 01:25:32,500
didn't let you mingle with other people,
and then the people that were around

1576
01:25:32,501 --> 01:25:33,880
you,
you didn't want to mingle with them.

1577
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:39,870
Horrific people that are just the worst
examples of a life gone wrong and you're

1578
01:25:40,811 --> 01:25:42,850
surrounded with them.
You still emerged.

1579
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:45,640
And that just,
that alone gives people hope.

1580
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:49,000
And that hope is something that
everybody needs is a good person on

1581
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:50,200
death row.
To the point that,

1582
01:25:50,201 --> 01:25:52,420
uh,
a man named Tom Lowenstein wanted to

1583
01:25:52,421 --> 01:25:55,870
write a book about me and I turned them
on to water oh,

1584
01:25:55,871 --> 01:25:57,550
Grad,
who's still sitting on death row.

1585
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,340
And I asked them to write the book about
Walter.

1586
01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:04,190
And then CNN death row stories wanted to
me and have Susan's

1587
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:06,770
friend and narrate my story.
Two and a half years ago,

1588
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,950
I told him again,
water still on death row,

1589
01:26:09,951 --> 01:26:11,330
man,
do for him.

1590
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:15,350
Now what's Walter Store that Walter was?
Walter,

1591
01:26:15,351 --> 01:26:17,420
oh,
grab was convicted of killing a little

1592
01:26:17,421 --> 01:26:19,880
girl and put her in a TV box,
but he didn't do it.

1593
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:24,710
And he had the misfortune of having his
brother attacked in his house and nearly

1594
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:27,290
murdered and being brought in for that
investigation.

1595
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:29,820
And then simply asked by detective,
hey,

1596
01:26:29,821 --> 01:26:32,330
there's a girl killed on your street.
Did you know anything about it?

1597
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:33,081
He goes,
yeah,

1598
01:26:33,081 --> 01:26:35,420
I know about it.
Next thing you know,

1599
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:39,740
he's facing death row.
So a jury finds him not guilty,

1600
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:43,280
but before the sabotage of one juror,
he ends up on death row.

1601
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:46,250
When the SEC sabotage of one juror,
he voted not guilty.

1602
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:47,940
And then he'd products out during the
vault.

1603
01:26:47,941 --> 01:26:48,651
Dare,
I lied,

1604
01:26:48,651 --> 01:26:48,990
I lied.

1605
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:49,910
He's a,
he's guilty.

1606
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,220
So they declare a mistrial.
Get the guy,

1607
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:55,880
they called him on senior to come in and
say that now he confessed to him,

1608
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:59,930
they have a second trial.
So they put all their on death row and I

1609
01:26:59,931 --> 01:27:02,510
meet him and everybody's abusing shit
out of him.

1610
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,370
So
I did the unnatural thing.

1611
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:11,750
I stood up for him for all the bullies
and I told the two men that were abusing

1612
01:27:11,751 --> 01:27:13,220
them if they put their hands on him
again,

1613
01:27:13,221 --> 01:27:16,700
I was going to get involved.
And I started helping Walter with his

1614
01:27:16,701 --> 01:27:19,160
lawyers.
And ever since I got out of prison,

1615
01:27:19,161 --> 01:27:21,560
I kept my word to stick by them and
fight for him.

1616
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:24,920
So I gave up opportunities,
could have changed my life.

1617
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:28,670
And now death row stories is back and
they're going to do my story.

1618
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:30,440
And Walter is still on death row right
now.

1619
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:31,400
Yeah.
And he's innocent.

1620
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:35,720
And what can be done to help walter
contact Tom Wolfe and ask him why the

1621
01:27:35,721 --> 01:27:40,610
innocence projects and the and integrity
units won't take up his case.

1622
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:42,290
There's no evidence.
And uh,

1623
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,710
it was clearly,
I mean when you see the show on a death

1624
01:27:45,711 --> 01:27:47,990
row stories,
it's just laid out so clear.

1625
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:51,500
I was a little disappointed they didn't
mention me that I turned them on to

1626
01:27:51,501 --> 01:27:54,560
Walter Myself.
Selfless sac was overlooked but that was

1627
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:57,980
just my ego.
But I always am like that and that's

1628
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:01,460
what I love.
I know that they were despicable joe and

1629
01:28:01,461 --> 01:28:04,100
the acts that a lot of men did word
spectacle,

1630
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:09,500
but if I let that stop me from loving
any of them than I was going to be

1631
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:11,390
nothing.
So yeah,

1632
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:14,390
a lot of them were really messed up man.
But the ones that needed it,

1633
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:17,360
I set aside everything and still cared
about men.

1634
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,860
So spell out Walter's name for
[inaudible],

1635
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:23,540
g R.
O D.

1636
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:23,541
O.
Grodd Walter.

1637
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:27,740
Oh Greg was convicted of putting a
little girl in a box and Philadelphia,

1638
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:29,810
we need to get Kim Kardashian on the
case.

1639
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,490
Yeah man.
Cause this is she's,

1640
01:28:31,491 --> 01:28:33,140
she's getting people released from
prison.

1641
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,810
Kim,
if you want to get someone a,

1642
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:35,990
uh,
a pardon.

1643
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:39,380
It's Walter.
This man has suffered enormously.

1644
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,670
People prison.
Is he in?

1645
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:42,980
He's in Greene County,
Super Maxim and pence,

1646
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:47,240
Pennsylvania.
I fought for my other friend Walt,

1647
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,500
Ernie Simmons.
He got out here the trials of Walter Al

1648
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,790
Grod,
shocking murder,

1649
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:56,240
so-called confessions and notorious
snitch to send a man to death row.

1650
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:01,480
Tom Lowenstein came to me while I was
still on death row in 2002 and he said,

1651
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:02,730
nick,
my God,

1652
01:29:02,731 --> 01:29:04,650
your story,
I want to write a book about you.

1653
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:05,630
And I said,
you,

1654
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:08,580
that's brilliant.
But how about the guy sitting next to

1655
01:29:08,581 --> 01:29:10,350
me?
It doesn't have lawyers or DNA or

1656
01:29:10,351 --> 01:29:11,340
anybody to help him.

1657
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:13,470
How about helping him?
He goes,

1658
01:29:13,471 --> 01:29:15,480
are you crazy?
You're given up an opportunity.

1659
01:29:15,481 --> 01:29:16,314
I said,
dude,

1660
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:19,170
it ain't like that.
I love this man.

1661
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:23,130
He has no lawyers like I do.
So that's the pattern.

1662
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:27,150
That's who I am.
So I didn't take credit for it,

1663
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:31,800
but I really did try to help another man
because I felt like I would be so

1664
01:29:31,801 --> 01:29:34,650
disappointing if I just took and took
and took for myself

1665
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:38,190
and you know,
I'm actually grateful I didn't go on

1666
01:29:38,191 --> 01:29:43,191
your podcast two years ago.
I was a homeless person without a family

1667
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:48,750
and now I got the two amazing girls,
Sara and Bethany and my wife Laura.

1668
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:52,560
These two English girls get the dream
life change.

1669
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:56,430
They get to move from Somerset,
England out here to Oregon and my little

1670
01:29:56,431 --> 01:30:00,940
girl gets on a yellow school bus show.
She goes the bus every day.

1671
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:02,680
She's in school.
They,

1672
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:04,230
they like,
I'm in the community.

1673
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:06,600
I got all these wonderful friends up in
Oregon,

1674
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:09,360
like Donnie Hobbs and these guys that
are my personal friends now.

1675
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:13,470
I built my community again,
like I got all these cool people up

1676
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:15,220
there that love me.
I,

1677
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,760
my wife's right now in Salem with her
friend carly,

1678
01:30:17,761 --> 01:30:21,000
and they're opening up a new shop up
there and all this stuff.

1679
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:25,230
So I really did it despite not having
anything.

1680
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:29,520
I did exactly what you said.
I went and overcame the debt probation

1681
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:32,550
and found community and built my tribe.
Look,

1682
01:30:32,551 --> 01:30:36,390
I know a lot of people s a struggle to
have people in their life that aren't

1683
01:30:36,391 --> 01:30:39,150
causing conflict.
It's you is allowing it,

1684
01:30:39,151 --> 01:30:41,220
man,
go out and find new people to be around.

1685
01:30:41,221 --> 01:30:43,890
Cause a lot of people want you if you're
a nice person.

1686
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:45,010
It's just hard for me

1687
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:48,190
people to find those people sometimes
and that's where they lose hope.

1688
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:51,310
You know,
people that don't and one of the things

1689
01:30:51,311 --> 01:30:53,200
they did it,
they don't know where to get started,

1690
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:55,240
right?
They don't know how to,

1691
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:57,450
how to get their life going,
how to get moving,

1692
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:59,470
how to feel good,
how to get success.

1693
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:02,260
There's so many different things.
And um,

1694
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:06,340
to those people I say just do something.
The more things you do,

1695
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:08,440
the more things you can do.
Do something,

1696
01:31:08,441 --> 01:31:11,200
do anything.
Whether it's commit to walking around

1697
01:31:11,201 --> 01:31:16,201
the block 10 times a night with whether
it's a committing to writing your life

1698
01:31:17,471 --> 01:31:18,020
story

1699
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:20,450
and you knew it stops a lot of people is
their self imagery.

1700
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:23,060
Right?
[inaudible] I,

1701
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,140
I was convicted of a rape and murder,
and in everyone's eyes,

1702
01:31:27,141 --> 01:31:32,000
I was a psychologically deranged person.
I had to live with that stigma everyday.

1703
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,010
Right?
Then when I got out,

1704
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:38,960
everybody thought I must be crazy as
fuck because I spent 8,057 days in

1705
01:31:38,961 --> 01:31:42,340
solitary confinement being tortured.
So there's no way I could be saying,

1706
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:43,540
right,
right.

1707
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:50,120
Their perspective had no effect on me
because by that time I'd given myself

1708
01:31:51,201 --> 01:31:56,150
enough education to know the difference
between what was done to me and who I

1709
01:31:56,151 --> 01:31:57,890
am.
And this is the problem with a lot of

1710
01:31:57,891 --> 01:32:01,870
people.
They fail to stop doing this thing where

1711
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:05,800
I am this or I am that and this is the
problem.

1712
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:11,370
So I really have never cared about the
perspective of anyone in the negative

1713
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:19,390
except for when they got it wrong,
from my intent to do good with them.

1714
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:21,970
And then it just became a battle of my
own ego.

1715
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:26,710
So I realized that the truth is,
as long as I know I'm doing right and

1716
01:32:26,711 --> 01:32:29,230
I'm doing good,
it isn't going to matter about their

1717
01:32:29,231 --> 01:32:31,870
perspective because the same person who
thought I was a rapist,

1718
01:32:31,871 --> 01:32:35,320
scumbag murderer now thinks I'm one of
the most eloquent speakers they met in

1719
01:32:35,321 --> 01:32:37,600
their life.
Their perspective about me changed,

1720
01:32:37,601 --> 01:32:40,870
but mine surely shouldn't,
but it did.

1721
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:42,910
And that's what a lot of people suffer
from.

1722
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:47,190
They let that negative comment make them
feel like they have to overcome it or

1723
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,300
have to live with it.
And I'll tell you what,

1724
01:32:49,301 --> 01:32:51,790
Joe,
I really never expected this,

1725
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:55,330
but for the first time in my life from
conducting an interview throughout the

1726
01:32:55,331 --> 01:32:58,240
whole process,
I've been reevaluating who I am and what

1727
01:32:58,241 --> 01:33:01,240
I'm saying.
It's like a fucking slap in the face,

1728
01:33:01,241 --> 01:33:01,960
man.

1729
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:05,080
Like I came in here,
the drag world with my emotions,

1730
01:33:05,081 --> 01:33:07,180
carrying him on my sleeves and all the
stress.

1731
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:09,520
I haven't slept well for days.
I haven't taken care of us.

1732
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:14,790
That's bullshit.
I didn't do well in articulating and you

1733
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:18,070
gave me a wake up call that I have never
had before.

1734
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:20,800
In any experience,
you can go back and look through the

1735
01:33:20,801 --> 01:33:24,910
history of the many experiences of ahead
of interviews and I've done some

1736
01:33:24,911 --> 01:33:28,180
outstanding ones.
I've never had a personal experience

1737
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,970
where throughout the course of speaking
of another man,

1738
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,880
I started to reevaluate everything I
held firmly to,

1739
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,860
and I promise you I'm going to go and
think a whole lot about this and get my

1740
01:33:38,861 --> 01:33:42,220
shit together because I do owe it to
allow to people to be one bad ass

1741
01:33:42,221 --> 01:33:45,070
motherfucker with a hell of a message to
yourself.

1742
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:47,740
Damn straight,
man.

1743
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:52,030
I'm going to do that.
I really am an so if you want me to come

1744
01:33:52,031 --> 01:33:53,740
and speak before your corporate
functions,

1745
01:33:53,741 --> 01:33:58,090
if we're a high school or university,
I do that better than anyone.

1746
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,140
In fact,
I'm fine.

1747
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:01,360
One of the finest speakers on the
planet,

1748
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:04,780
and I learned it because I watched Bruce
springsteen.

1749
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:07,750
You remember that speech he gave at the
Oscars for Philadelphia?

1750
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:10,390
No,
I never watched the Oscars.

1751
01:34:10,391 --> 01:34:11,410
Dude,
get that up.

1752
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:14,180
My God.
Bruce springsteen is one of the finest

1753
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:16,530
speakers.
No,

1754
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:19,720
but just the image.
But dude gave one of the most profound

1755
01:34:19,721 --> 01:34:23,400
speeches I ever waste.
Beautiful Girl.

1756
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:27,880
He made the nexus point between music
and imagery.

1757
01:34:27,881 --> 01:34:32,881
So poignant that I was blown away by it.
So much so that when we made the

1758
01:34:33,461 --> 01:34:37,810
documentary fear of 13,
that's all I'd kept imagining when I

1759
01:34:37,811 --> 01:34:40,210
spoke was the imagery we would be
lended.

1760
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:45,870
And I love the fact that I worked very
hard to bring the whole audience into my

1761
01:34:46,771 --> 01:34:51,771
cell one time to spend with me my story
in a way that no one ever did before and

1762
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:54,730
I fucking rocked it.

1763
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:57,650
That's awesome.
Yeah,

1764
01:34:57,651 --> 01:35:00,110
I liked that.
I liked the fact that I know I have

1765
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:02,900
talent in that field.
I don't want to boast,

1766
01:35:02,901 --> 01:35:06,770
but I have a gift and it King uh,
light years ahead of me.

1767
01:35:06,771 --> 01:35:11,771
When I watched,
I had 400 students in ealing enraptured

1768
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:16,560
at a conference.
My friend at educator named Emma Dopson

1769
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:19,430
set this whole thing up.
So go there,

1770
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:23,570
you could hear a pin drop because all
along,

1771
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:29,440
somewhere along the way,
an energy clicks in and I can hold a

1772
01:35:30,381 --> 01:35:34,880
room in palm of my hand.
I've had some amazing experiences with

1773
01:35:34,881 --> 01:35:39,590
it.
I don't know how to stay at,

1774
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:45,050
but that cult of personality lure of
being on the stage and talking to people

1775
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:49,430
is powerful man.
And I can see why Tony Robbins and

1776
01:35:49,431 --> 01:35:52,520
everybody gets up in nine eight Dudette
I'm not a life coach.

1777
01:35:52,521 --> 01:35:54,080
I can't coach no one's life.

1778
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:59,300
But I can tell you about your life and
ma in ways that would make you really

1779
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:03,260
invigorated to want to make a better
life for yourself,

1780
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:05,810
but no one could truly be your life
coach.

1781
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:08,960
You got to do that shit yourself.
And I love it.

1782
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:12,560
I love it that I understood those
moments because one of the coolest

1783
01:36:12,561 --> 01:36:17,090
things was I used to go to the globe
theater.

1784
01:36:17,091 --> 01:36:19,880
Anybody did understand Shakespeare
understands the globe.

1785
01:36:19,881 --> 01:36:22,190
Theater is the center of the world for
Shakespeare.

1786
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:27,910
They would perform titus andronicus and
then after which Cleopatra would come

1787
01:36:28,611 --> 01:36:31,520
out on stage and introduced me to the
Carl.

1788
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:36,790
Now I had eight minutes,
10 minutes tops to do this thing and in

1789
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:41,990
eight to 10 minutes I had a crowd who
had been spanning for three hours long

1790
01:36:41,991 --> 01:36:45,080
play crying,
putting money in a bucket for what I

1791
01:36:45,081 --> 01:36:47,240
said to them and did it flawlessly every
time.

1792
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:50,030
And I did it for a whole summer in
London.

1793
01:36:50,031 --> 01:36:55,031
It was the most amazing experience to
stand there and look out over this vista

1794
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:59,690
of London after you did this amazing
thing where people never expect that you

1795
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:02,300
and you are nothing to do with the
theater.

1796
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:06,110
You are just a human rights charity
chosen by the theater to come out and

1797
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:07,190
speak.
And I,

1798
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,320
I realized that that moment I had a
gift.

1799
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:13,520
If I could get people who have been
standing for three hours watching a play

1800
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,700
to have wet tears in her eyes,
putting money,

1801
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:21,040
shoving it into a bucket for me than I
knew I had some ability to finally

1802
01:37:21,561 --> 01:37:25,220
speak.
I was no longer an aphasia effected,

1803
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:27,380
destroyed,
distorted mine,

1804
01:37:27,650 --> 01:37:32,650
addled by drugs and used beyond belief
to distortions of like I was so screwed

1805
01:37:34,161 --> 01:37:37,820
up to come back to do that.
I knew I was,

1806
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,070
do you know I wrote this whole book in
only three days.

1807
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,010
Wow.
200 and I have a gift Joe.

1808
01:37:43,011 --> 01:37:46,190
Like seriously,
like I wrote and I have witnesses.

1809
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:49,910
I wrote the whole book in two and a half
days man.

1810
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:55,350
Cause it was in me.
This story monsters med mum was so

1811
01:37:55,351 --> 01:37:58,290
powerful that when I met Laura,
my wife,

1812
01:37:58,470 --> 01:37:59,161
I told her,
I said,

1813
01:37:59,161 --> 01:38:01,350
you know what?
I'm a finally do it man.

1814
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:03,360
I'm gonna get this out.
And it,

1815
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:06,780
it just came out for two and a half
days.

1816
01:38:06,781 --> 01:38:08,250
I barely slept,
ate,

1817
01:38:08,251 --> 01:38:11,340
did anything.
All I did was make love to my wife on a

1818
01:38:11,341 --> 01:38:14,850
break or right.
And I mean poured it out and I poured

1819
01:38:14,851 --> 01:38:18,750
out the whole book and I've realized
that was needed to move on.

1820
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,230
And it's,
it's the best book I ever wrote my life.

1821
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:25,980
And I'm so proud that it's my last one
because I don't have to worry about no

1822
01:38:25,981 --> 01:38:26,814
more stories.

1823
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:28,790
I did the thing that was great.
All right,

1824
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,540
so this one changed.
This is really fear of 13 my countdown

1825
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:34,710
to execution,
it went through hell.

1826
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:38,880
It got canceled.
It's now fear of 13 then I wrote the

1827
01:38:38,881 --> 01:38:41,490
kindness approach.
I did one called my journey through her

1828
01:38:41,491 --> 01:38:44,490
eyes.
I didn't bring a copy as you,

1829
01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:46,290
wait a minute.
Do you not want to write?

1830
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,790
Like why?
Why do you say that?

1831
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:52,770
I hope it doesn't because I crafted my
series of books that create and

1832
01:38:52,771 --> 01:38:55,370
captivate my whole entire message.
Right?

1833
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:00,680
And I want to leave it pure.
I don't want to then go on and make up a

1834
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:03,840
falsifications of things that didn't
happen.

1835
01:39:04,290 --> 01:39:06,900
So all these are nonfiction.
All these are nonfiction.

1836
01:39:06,901 --> 01:39:11,490
All these events are true and points in
my life and I think that's the best

1837
01:39:11,491 --> 01:39:13,170
thing to do.
Stay true to who I am.

1838
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:18,230
I was going to tell one story called,
that's enough for me as a fictionalized

1839
01:39:18,331 --> 01:39:22,500
writer just to show everybody my talent
because people in the past that said,

1840
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:23,910
wow,
you can write anything.

1841
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:28,170
So I was going to do that,
but I've held back because I thought I

1842
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:29,100
want to leave it.
Cool.

1843
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:31,590
I want to leave it like,
this is my series of work.

1844
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:36,620
My work is I wrote to prison books and I
wrote two books that will guide people

1845
01:39:37,771 --> 01:39:40,800
in life,
how not to be screwed up or bitter.

1846
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:45,420
And I want to leave that as my message.
I want to go and do other things,

1847
01:39:45,421 --> 01:39:48,030
but those are my books and I'm proud of
the work I did.

1848
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:50,910
I got it out of my system.
I'm a published author.

1849
01:39:51,030 --> 01:39:52,740
I can go down in history.
Is that right?

1850
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:57,000
I'm cool with that.
I don't really want to then push it and

1851
01:39:57,001 --> 01:40:00,660
think that I can then lower people into
reading more works than I'd can try

1852
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:02,190
because that's not really fair to them.

1853
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:03,900
Do you know what I mean?
I,

1854
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:06,630
I want to keep it that way.
I think that's one of the things I want

1855
01:40:06,631 --> 01:40:08,910
to try and stay true to.
Now,

1856
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:12,600
speaking as my love now,
negative,

1857
01:40:12,610 --> 01:40:15,720
someone wants to hire you to speak,
where would they go?

1858
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:16,890
Nick Harris.
Dot Org.

1859
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:18,750
So it's really simple.
Um,

1860
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:22,050
everyone on the podcast can easily find
me on the other social medias.

1861
01:40:22,051 --> 01:40:23,910
But I have,
like I said,

1862
01:40:23,911 --> 01:40:25,600
my really close friends,
Adam,

1863
01:40:25,630 --> 01:40:28,170
uh,
Callahan and his wife just had a baby so

1864
01:40:28,171 --> 01:40:31,710
that everyone in my website,
[inaudible] dot org and a lot of people

1865
01:40:31,711 --> 01:40:36,330
can reach me for functions like that.
But I really love the fact that I have a

1866
01:40:36,331 --> 01:40:40,770
chance to also with this my vs.
Dot com to go ahead and go into schools.

1867
01:40:40,771 --> 01:40:43,020
And there's a really cool thing,
you know,

1868
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:47,130
this x generation times three men,
they're like so computer savvy,

1869
01:40:47,131 --> 01:40:47,964
right?

1870
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:51,300
So much so that you actually are
starting a trend.

1871
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:56,710
There's no longer 15 minutes of fame.
There's the five second video clip of

1872
01:40:56,711 --> 01:41:00,220
fame now and has been reduced.
It's just like everything's five

1873
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:00,941
seconds,
you know what I mean?

1874
01:41:00,941 --> 01:41:03,670
It's no longer,
so everything in the education field is

1875
01:41:03,671 --> 01:41:07,480
coming to us faster and faster.
So we need to use the analytics of

1876
01:41:07,481 --> 01:41:11,110
something like my verse to go ahead and
get a child to figure out who they can

1877
01:41:11,111 --> 01:41:14,530
go and be in their careers and then
follow that correct path.

1878
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:16,910
You can't just throw it against the wall
anymore,

1879
01:41:16,911 --> 01:41:18,790
Joe.
You have to really work hard to get

1880
01:41:18,791 --> 01:41:22,060
children to feel good about being a taxi
driver,

1881
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:24,040
a painter.
You know,

1882
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:29,041
it's not no shame to be a a person who
goes out and does a simple manual job,

1883
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:32,530
if that makes you happy as a human
being,

1884
01:41:32,531 --> 01:41:34,390
you should be able to do that without
the stigma,

1885
01:41:34,391 --> 01:41:35,224
right?

1886
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:37,060
But the school's not going to tell you
that.

1887
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:39,550
You know,
they're going to tell you you could be

1888
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:42,700
anything,
but why wouldn't you want to find out

1889
01:41:42,701 --> 01:41:45,160
what would make you happy in life and be
that right?

1890
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:49,330
That makes sense to me.
So not going to learn that from school.

1891
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:51,730
Now learn that from people,
from people,

1892
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:55,450
and you'll learn that from,
from online more than anything today.

1893
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:58,120
And that's why I want to be involved in
the educational field.

1894
01:41:58,450 --> 01:42:01,510
I think that's my greatest gift of
someone who went to prison,

1895
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:05,770
who hadn't ever read a book,
who accomplished the things that he did.

1896
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:09,850
Then can share how the purpose of my
education was.

1897
01:42:09,851 --> 01:42:12,880
So did I,
was able to process life enough to

1898
01:42:12,881 --> 01:42:15,760
handle it.
To give myself enough separation to

1899
01:42:15,761 --> 01:42:20,410
realize who I was as a human being is
not the sum total of my misery and that

1900
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:25,390
I could then help others structured
their lives through politeness to go and

1901
01:42:25,391 --> 01:42:26,860
get a good education.

1902
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:31,960
And I love that fact that I worked so
hard through all these different things

1903
01:42:32,290 --> 01:42:34,240
to not lose that message.
Men.

1904
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,970
And it really does work for a lot of
young people.

1905
01:42:36,971 --> 01:42:39,540
They find that there's self restrict,
uh,

1906
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:44,640
respect really does grow when someone
gives them just a small little bit of a

1907
01:42:45,191 --> 01:42:46,024
break.
Man,

1908
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:48,470
they're so honest.
I love,

1909
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:51,490
I love it.
I'll never tire of it in that one regard

1910
01:42:51,491 --> 01:42:53,140
because I've touched so many young
people's lives.

1911
01:42:53,141 --> 01:42:54,670
Man.
That's beautiful.

1912
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:57,730
That's a great message.
And uh,

1913
01:42:57,820 --> 01:42:59,500
thanks for being here man.
I really appreciate it.

1914
01:42:59,501 --> 01:43:00,640
I'm glad we did this.
Yeah,

1915
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:01,780
me too.
I really do.

1916
01:43:01,781 --> 01:43:05,200
Can I give a quick shot at this?
So I got some good friends of mine.

1917
01:43:05,201 --> 01:43:08,530
I'd,
I really messed up on Alex Ortiz and uh,

1918
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:11,050
I like these young dudes,
these fighters joke,

1919
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:13,420
they're all mad about you.
And I like it.

1920
01:43:13,450 --> 01:43:15,100
What do you think about the Bella tour
anyway?

1921
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:16,090
I love it.
Yeah,

1922
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:18,790
we'll need more.
We need more organizations like that,

1923
01:43:18,791 --> 01:43:20,290
but I think Bella tours doing a great
job.

1924
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:21,720
Yeah.
Jesse Casa Kosky.

1925
01:43:21,721 --> 01:43:25,210
He's gonna fight this Mofo bear.
And I like the fact that his father

1926
01:43:25,211 --> 01:43:28,750
teaches that coon Tao with that prison
style of martial arts.

1927
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:30,040
I don't know what that is.
Oh,

1928
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:31,930
well it's the old style.
It's like,

1929
01:43:31,931 --> 01:43:36,550
um,
it isn't like the martial arts that most

1930
01:43:36,551 --> 01:43:40,600
people would know because it's derived
from the Filipino prison systems.

1931
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:44,410
It's like really pure solves of quick
attacks and stuff like that.

1932
01:43:44,411 --> 01:43:47,890
So as soon as in the boxing,
but now I like it that like dudes,

1933
01:43:47,891 --> 01:43:50,890
I've got Mike Campbell and all these
guys have been really supportive to me

1934
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:52,910
and everyone,
like I said,

1935
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:56,180
that knew I was coming on here.
I just want to tell them if I forgot who

1936
01:43:56,181 --> 01:43:56,990
you are.

1937
01:43:56,990 --> 01:44:01,070
Thank you all for being so supportive.
And I really want to say thank you to my

1938
01:44:01,071 --> 01:44:05,690
wife for being so therefore me lately,
and I'm really grateful that we've

1939
01:44:05,691 --> 01:44:09,200
learned in this wonderful lesson that I
might belong to you,

1940
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:12,980
sweetheart,
but I also have some good left to do and

1941
01:44:12,981 --> 01:44:16,070
I'm gonna try and do both well,
and I'm very grateful to everyone.

1942
01:44:16,071 --> 01:44:17,270
Listen,
especially to you,

1943
01:44:17,271 --> 01:44:19,480
Mister broken.
You're really nice young man.

1944
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:22,340
Thanks man.
I'm grateful to you as well.

1945
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:24,470
Now I'd mean that Joe and I know you're
going to do,

1946
01:44:24,471 --> 01:44:26,810
he said on a nice young man like you're
my grandma.

1947
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,210
You're a nice young man.
A even better.

1948
01:44:29,211 --> 01:44:31,790
I'm your sexy granddad.
Give me some love,

1949
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:32,451
boy.
Thank you.

1950
01:44:32,451 --> 01:44:34,640
Go and have a good day.
Or we want to love your round the world

1951
01:44:34,641 --> 01:44:35,001
by,
by,

1952
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:37,280
by Martin Mooc.
How man.

1953
01:44:37,281 --> 01:44:40,400
Bye Bye.
Bye Bye everybody.
