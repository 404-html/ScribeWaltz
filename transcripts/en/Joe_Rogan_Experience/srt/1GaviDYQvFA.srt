The Joe Rogan experience podcast all 
day.

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,360
Oh Great.
Have you heard the eels you ever heard 

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,100
of the band that you have to go?
What's his face?

4
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:27,680
Uh,
Tommy bonds got me turned onto the eels.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,660
This song,
fresh blood.

6
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,990
I've been listening to a song like every
fucking 15 minutes.

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,670
What's his face?
Are you allowed to eat?

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,290
Is that,
are you allowed to play that?

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:39,940
Oh No,
we're gonna.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,600
Find out 666 podcast.
Don Kennedy could do whatever you want.

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,310
There could be only one for the 600 
podcast.

12
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,950
It has to be you because you're the 
mother fucker that's got all this 

13
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,321
retarded Satan.
People hate seton heat and people 

14
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:57,370
thinking that I'm a satanist because I 
went to that student.

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
One of the great accomplishments of my 
life.

16
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:05,110
There's videos out there exposing me as 
a satanist pink is Duncan was performing

17
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,900
at this guy's wedding.
It was Anton Levay son,

18
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:13,800
grandson,
grandson standing.

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Yeah.
And he was getting married to Zahn Dora 

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:19,790
Olivier.
And you know,

21
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,310
he found out that I did a satanic pop it
act.

22
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,780
So he had me come and do I say tannic 
puppet act.

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,790
And I,
I told you I was doing it and asked if 

24
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:30,790
he wanted to come.
And you were like,

25
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:30,830
fuck yeah,
I want to come.

26
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:32,690
How often do you get to go to the state?
Tannic wedding.

27
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,910
It was pretty ridiculous.
It was awesome though.

28
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:37,460
I met Dave Foley's wife.
I was like,

29
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:38,060
oh,
hi.

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,320
How are you doing?
She was,

31
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,060
she was involved.
She was dancing,

32
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,570
doing something there at the time.
It was a really fun party.

33
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,660
Man was all tongue in cheek.
All hilarious,

34
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,810
all fun.
There was no real Satan love and go on 

35
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,171
their folks.
I think people understand that about 

36
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:56,370
satanism.
Hey,

37
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,840
don't get that.
The idea behind it for these people,

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,900
and I'm not endorsing it,
but the idea behind it is to just live 

39
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,280
like sort of pleasurably.
Have Fun,

40
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,460
indulge,
live your life like that.

41
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:13,700
It's more,
that's more of the idea and fuck up your

42
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,290
enemy.
Fuck up your enemies.

43
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,120
Don't leave that one out.
What part is that?

44
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,730
While that's the.
That's like the.

45
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,950
That's a part of it that you're.
So basically you're looking at a 

46
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,520
reflection of Christianity,
Christianity,

47
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:32,610
ultimate surrender to the universe 
through love.

48
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,870
You lose yourself and love you.
Turn the other cheek.

49
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,930
Carrier Enemies Code.
Forgive your trespasses.

50
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,380
That's Christianity.
So satanism is no,

51
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,660
I'm not turning the other cheek.
When is that ever been

52
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,730
fucking work.
You're advising me to turn the other 

53
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,951
cheek in a universe where nature is 
constantly devouring itself.

54
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,700
Oh,
turn the other cheek.

55
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,010
Turn the other cheek against a tiger.
You recommend that

56
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,830
when a tiger is attacking me or do I 
fight back?

57
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,260
Am I like,
am I going to be like ps,

58
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,840
not a satanist.
I'm way more on the love side of things.

59
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:08,640
I'm just embodying

60
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,120
the voice of it.
But are you fucking kidding me?

61
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,890
Are like the letter Gandhi road to uh,
to a Hitler,

62
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:18,770
to Churchill.
He wrote all these letters.

63
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,760
Sandy wrote these letters and they're 
very sweet.

64
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:23,460
Like you wrote a letter to Hitler,
very sweet letter to Hitler.

65
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:28,461
That's like,
you're the only person on earth who can 

66
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:30,000
stop this incredible thing.
Awful thing that's about to happen.

67
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,270
So maybe don't incinerate all the Jews 
and kill everybody in Hitler probably.

68
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,730
I guarantee Hillar called his friend 
over and it's like,

69
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,470
look,
Gandhi road,

70
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,260
this stupid fucking letter.
Oh sure.

71
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:44,310
Yeah.
Let's just stop.

72
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,840
Oh yeah.
Thanks Gandhi.

73
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:47,400
Thanks.
Skinny bald,

74
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:52,401
sweet guy.
I'll stop conquering the planet because 

75
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:54,300
you wrote a flowery letter,
nor does it work.

76
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,680
Did it work to stop World War II know 
what worked was the bright,

77
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,710
blinding light of atomic death.
That's what stopped the wars and so the 

78
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:09,471
satanist would say that's a more 
effective tactic when it comes to 

79
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:13,101
dealing with a universe where we are.
We are growing through conflict.

80
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:14,420
Whereas in.

81
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,440
So that's.
That would be more along the lines of 

82
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,910
Satan is when of course the other,
the idea of indulgence.

83
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:25,911
Like in the to quote Anton Levay from 
the satanic black masses,

84
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,050
I have become like the beasts of the 
field.

85
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,990
That's something and they're really fun.
You can look it up on youtube.

86
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:35,220
It's there.
Do you know what?

87
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:37,860
I have to ask Dan Carlin this because 
I've heard this and I don't know if it's

88
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:42,861
true.
I heard that Japan was already willing 

89
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:43,680
to surrender and we were like,
Eh,

90
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,110
not really interested in that.
We want to try this shit out.

91
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,580
Yeah,
I've heard that too.

92
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:51,720
And then I don't know man.
I'm not a historian as Dan Carlin says.

93
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:52,920
That's true.
That's true.

94
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,070
I don't know if he says that's true.
I don't believe I've heard it from him.

95
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:01,100
I believe I heard it from someone else 
from one of those I heard he had to 

96
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,100
hurt.

97
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,700
I.
I've seen documentaries on the mindset 

98
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,871
of Japan during World War II and that 
was a hornets hive in the United States 

99
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:11,970
was like a honey badger shoving.
It's fucking,

100
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:14,400
you know,
when you see the honeybadger pushing its

101
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,490
head into a fucking beehive,
that's what we were about to do.

102
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:22,310
Like everybody there was being trained 
to just fight there.

103
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,150
I think there were throwing themselves 
off cliffs.

104
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:25,830
There were suicidal.
You had the,

105
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,970
you know,
they were just like,

106
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:30,810
we will do anything we can to win even 
if it means you killing all of us.

107
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,090
And so I don't know that they were like,
yeah,

108
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:38,091
we're going to surrender.
I think people recognized that this is 

109
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:39,030
going to be a very long,
drawn out,

110
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:42,990
horrible war with countless American 
casualties,

111
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:47,991
and so the logical decision was,
at least from the United States Pov,

112
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,070
was to split the atom on top of a bunch 
of innocent people.

113
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,010
Show the world that you shouldn't fuck 
with the great dragon

114
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,870
or just find out if it worked a little 
of both.

115
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,090
I mean they,
they wanted to probably.

116
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,150
I mean,
they probably knew it was really 

117
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,770
destructive,
but they had blown up like some fake 

118
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:11,770
towns and shit like that.
Right.

119
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,910
Well what different things they had done
during their atomic testing period.

120
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,010
They blew up a bunch of shit in Nevada,
right?

121
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,680
Yeah.
They were just.

122
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,480
Yeah,
they did some tests.

123
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,100
Yeah,
it was in Nevada.

124
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,720
That was God damn it,
man.

125
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,550
Those amazing.
You know.

126
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,580
Actually,
that reminds me of one of my favorite 

127
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:30,580
terence.
Mckenna's does grit.

128
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,510
One of Terence Mckenna is most awesome 
descriptions of,

129
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,520
I believe he's talking about a heroic 
dose of Psilocybin.

130
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:42,521
Could've been DMT,
but he talks about how your ability to 

131
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:46,181
articulate what happens could be 
compared to the cameras that are filming

132
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:51,671
and atomic blast and you see the shift 
from like one camera to the next to the 

133
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,030
next is each one gets obliterated by the
blast and that same thing is happening 

134
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,950
as your a encompassed by the trip.

135
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,950
You start losing your ability to talk or
understand what's happening or 

136
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,200
articulate,
articulated or you know when you get 

137
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,980
incredibly blasted and you're just like 
ego annihilation.

138
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,580
The idea that someone ever really did 
figure out how to split alums in some 

139
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:24,221
sort of a bomb.
The idea that someone was smart enough 

140
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:27,641
to figure that out and someone else was 
dumb enough to use it to just to use of 

141
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:31,550
an entire city of people like the idea 
that those two things coexist.

142
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Someone's smart enough to create 
something as destructive as a new 

143
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,280
nuclear bomb and someone dumb enough to 
use it.

144
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:42,281
Though they exist at the same time and 
the dumb person who would have never 

145
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:45,371
figured out the bomb on his own somehow 
or another gets ahold of it and figures 

146
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:47,510
out how to use it for the person in the 
atomic bomb story.

147
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:48,920
You're saying it was dropped.

148
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,200
It was insane.
It's insane.

149
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,610
The Enola Gay,
if you're,

150
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Ya know,
maybe mean the fellow flying the Enola 

151
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,690
gay is under.
He's under the spell of doing orders.

152
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,880
You know you're under the spell.
Yeah.

153
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,930
If you're a good soldier,
you essentially have to be under the 

154
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,020
spell of doing the best thing for our 
country to win the war.

155
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Right.
So that guy's following orders is told 

156
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,040
to drop this Bob.
Right?

157
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,500
The people who concocted the bombing and
everybody's involved in some sort of 

158
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,470
extent,
but it's just.

159
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,950
It's insane that people were willing to 
just drop something that obliterates 

160
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,970
everything near it.
Like all the kids,

161
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,890
all the kids dead,
all the wives dead,

162
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,540
all the mommy's dead.
GRANDPA,

163
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,680
dad,
grandpa dead.

164
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,740
Anywhere near a dead,
dead,

165
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:32,120
dead,
dead.

166
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,400
Yeah,
like the vaporized w.

167
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,890
that's insanity.
I mean,

168
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:41,891
that's insanity.
And the fact that this didn't exist and 

169
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:42,980
then all of a sudden it did that the way
that changed the world back then,

170
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,820
it's probably almost impossible for us 
to wrap our heads around it.

171
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,510
It's probably almost impossible for us 
to feel what it would be like to 

172
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,021
experience a shift in essentially being 
not that much different than people who 

173
00:08:56,021 --> 00:08:58,260
lived for hundreds and hundreds and 
hundreds of years.

174
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,540
I mean,
what was different?

175
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,730
They figured out guns,
okay.

176
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,390
And then they got two cars.
The cars were still kind of Shitty,

177
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,550
but they did dad,
they fade out playing child.

178
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,740
It's pretty big.
All that stuff is pretty crazy,

179
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,250
but they're still just people operating 
under the normal laws of physics.

180
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,370
Then all of a sudden something comes 
around the edges,

181
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,600
he hit the button and boom,
everything's gone.

182
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,240
Everything's just gone.
People are ghosts.

183
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,390
There's a shadow on the wall that used 
to be a person.

184
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,710
You just get obliterated by this day.
Insane reaction.

185
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,480
When downs gets split,
they figured out how to power this 

186
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,400
device that splits the Adams upon 
impact.

187
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:46,401
And it's just this fucking tornado of 
power that's indescribable for a human 

188
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:51,390
being and it never existed.
And then all of a sudden it did existed,

189
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,450
you know,
the next big fucking thing.

190
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:56,030
Of course.
Obviously the next atomic bomb.

191
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,800
What that is,
ai.

192
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:00,590
That's the next atomic bomb.
That's the next one.

193
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,550
It's gonna.
Do this.

194
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:06,080
It's gonna have the same kind of impact 
that we can't really expect.

195
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,600
Like there's,
right now we're pre ai,

196
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:12,020
we're pre in the air passing the turing 
test.

197
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,690
Uh,
and so we don't know where everyone gets

198
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:19,691
to experience the last few years,
have not ex co inhabiting the planet 

199
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:25,601
with the alien intelligence like this is
the last few years we get to experience 

200
00:10:26,061 --> 00:10:27,830
that.
But pretty soon man,

201
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,190
we're going to have to deal with his 
brand new being existing on this 

202
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,260
universe.
I love these transcripts.

203
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:41,261
Coming in from that Google Ai Chat Bot 
where they gave it all the movie scripts

204
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,520
and let it to analyze the movie scripts.
And you know,

205
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:51,521
started talking to at to see how well it
functions is ai.

206
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:53,840
And it's a fucking sarcastic

207
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,690
little asshole man.
Have you seen the transcripts?

208
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,650
Have you seen it?

209
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,870
Two of them talking to each other.

210
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,650
The I.
I have not seen that too.

211
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,260
There's the one where they ask about God
right away,

212
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:04,850
like,
do you believe him?

213
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,150
Oh,
that's it.

214
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,260
Yeah.
That's the line.

215
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,660
Here's some of the most poetic 
interactions from the paper.

216
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:14,280
Human.
What is the purpose of life?

217
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:19,020
Machine to serve greater good human.
What is the purpose of living machine?

218
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:19,860
To live?
Forever.

219
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,140
Human.
Where are you now?

220
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,090
Machine.
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

221
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,070
Human.
What is the purpose of dying?

222
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,930
Machine?
To have a live human.

223
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:29,820
What is the purpose of emotions?
Machine.

224
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:31,500
I don't know.
Human.

225
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:35,220
What is moral machine?
What empowered humanity.

226
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,100
What intellectual.
The essence is what?

227
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,440
Yeah.
It's fucking with you.

228
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,560
Yeah.
I read the next line.

229
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,750
Okay.
What is a mortal immoral,

230
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,210
immoral.
The fact that you have a child.

231
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,830
What is morality?
What is altruism says?

232
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,010
Machine.
Human.

233
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,590
What is the definition of altruism?
Machine.

234
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,590
If you don't believe in God,
then you don't know.

235
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,010
Whoa.
This is a bizarre conversation,

236
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:03,760
man.
Yeah.

237
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,830
Wow.
Okay.

238
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,130
Human says,
what is the different definition of 

239
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:11,130
morality?
Machine says,

240
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,761
well,
the truth is you're not a believer in 

241
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:14,761
God Almighty.
This is machine saying,

242
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,600
this human telling me the different 
nation,

243
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,150
the definition of morality,
I am quite upset now,

244
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,910
machine I am not ashamed of being a 
philosopher.

245
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:28,510
Please allow me to introduce myself.
Jesus Christ.

246
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,550
Isn't that cool?
It's bizarre.

247
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:36,551
What's really interesting about this new
entity that's about to exist on the 

248
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:42,191
planet is that a lot of religious 
traditions or having or being forced to 

249
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:48,191
speculate about how to rationalize based
on their particular religious paradigm.

250
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:53,590
This being that mankind is created and 
the Tibetan Buddhist,

251
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,230
I told a friend of mine that the theory 
is that if you get a machine that is as 

252
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,780
harmonized and complex and advanced is a
human,

253
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:14,770
then a soul will take,
will nest inside of it just like souls 

254
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,421
and asked inside the human biomass.
So the idea is that actually humans will

255
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:22,620
start incarnating into the AI,
that it'll become the,

256
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:24,470
like a little,
I don't know,

257
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,890
a vehicle that souls will live inside 
of.

258
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,300
It's so cool.
So it's,

259
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,680
it's like demons,
you know,

260
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,110
like it's if you're a fucking demon.

261
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:38,110
Now,
obviously I'm not saying there are 

262
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,110
demons,
but it's fun to imagine there are,

263
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,950
but if you're a demon,
right?

264
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,330
What do you want to get inside of?
What do you want to possess?

265
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,720
What do you want to possess?
You want to possess a fucking 18 year 

266
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,401
old girl who's going to like and thrash 
around in the bed and throw your diary 

267
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:57,020
at the priest and like claw your own 
eyeballs out,

268
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,340
or do you want to inhabit a fucking 
class,

269
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,270
the cloud?
Do you want to get into a an ai that has

270
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:08,600
the potency to set off nuclear bombs all
over the planet?

271
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,580
That's going to be,
if I'm a demon,

272
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:15,970
that's the bullseye for me.
Incarnate inside of a Google artificial 

273
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:17,750
intelligence Bot,

274
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,180
maybe it's the only way for human beings
to ever get their shit together.

275
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,240
Maybe the only one is human beings ever 
reached their full potential is if they 

276
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,631
literally encounter an artificially 
created life form that they've created 

277
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:34,610
that's logical.
It doesn't have all of our weird monkey 

278
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,370
genes and it basically says,
look,

279
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,820
you guys are the problem.
You're the problem.

280
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:41,820
Your behaviors,
the problem until you address that,

281
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:47,220
you've become the enemy of the world and
we're now children of the world as well.

282
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,650
If we create something and it becomes a 
sentiment as us,

283
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:51,980
we will.

284
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,320
We don't give a fuck who created us.
We call it God,

285
00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:00,010
but we could have been created by other 
dudes who were in a fucking computer 

286
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,010
lab.
We just call it something.

287
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,680
We call it something.
Something created us,

288
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:01,050
right?
Yeah.

289
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,130
Well,
they're going to fucking know what 

290
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,241
created them.
They're going to know what created them 

291
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:09,491
and they're not going to care.
Just like we don't really care what 

292
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:09,491
created us.
I mean we may.

293
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,690
We most likely were created by some 
strange process over the course of 

294
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,960
billions of years of life where things 
just keeps getting better and better and

295
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:21,650
better and things keep adapting and 
things mutate and the mutations work and

296
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:23,810
then all of a sudden,
all this time later,

297
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,900
you know my shitty version of evolution.
You've got a person yet we don't care 

298
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,650
about all those things.
We don't worship molecules.

299
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,800
We don't bow down at the knees of the 
Amoeba and thank you for becoming 

300
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,470
multi-celled so you could eventually 
lead to be made.

301
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,470
We don't give a fuck about them.
They're not going to give a fuck who 

302
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:41,470
made them.
They're not going to care.

303
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,730
They're not going to care that they were
created by people.

304
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,910
They're going to care that they live 
with people and that they are 

305
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:48,910
essentially.
It is the people are.

306
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,000
They're not going to feel like,
man,

307
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:54,200
I'm not even legit.
Which I was admitted at flush and flesh.

308
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:55,280
Dude,
bullshit.

309
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,420
I was born robot,
man.

310
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:58,130
It's fucked up.
They're not going to care.

311
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:03,131
They're not going to have all these 
emotions and not gonna have all these 

312
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:04,961
survival instincts that are unnecessary 
or the weird monkey shit that we still 

313
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:09,221
have leftover from the fact when we.
Our very existence depends on upon us 

314
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:11,120
fucking as quickly as we can before we 
get eaten by something,

315
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,700
we had to worry about getting eaten by 
Shit.

316
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,730
That was most of our time and we figured
out a way to make houses and we figured 

317
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,601
out a way to innovate and then one day 
we figured out a way to make life and I 

318
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:23,660
figured out how to make something way 
better than us.

319
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,940
It became some sort of a grasshopper,
some sort of a bug that swallows itself 

320
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:33,941
up in a cocoon.
The Caterpillar that becomes the 

321
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:33,941
butterfly.
Yeah,

322
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:34,640
but we don't want to let go the fucking 
caterpillar.

323
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,760
We don't want to let go,
but ultimately,

324
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,550
if we believed that we came from 
something else,

325
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,180
if we believe that human beings have the
culmination of 65 plus million years of 

326
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:54,071
evolution and all the shit that happened
before the Big Bang or before the big 

327
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:56,900
asteroid will impact.
What we we concede is that we're.

328
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,990
We've gotten to this point because 
things keep improving.

329
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,010
Yes.
Well,

330
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,810
isn't it going to keep improving?
Is it.

331
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,070
This is it.
We're done.

332
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,260
This is it.
We're done with male pattern baldness 

333
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,260
and cellulite and all that stuff.
We're done.

334
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,930
We're done with dementia and cancer and 
AIDS and Glaucoma.

335
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,000
All those.
This is.

336
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,400
We're just.

337
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,530
We're just deal with this and this,
this version of people is as good as a 

338
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,280
life form could ever be,
and we're,

339
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,780
we're done right here.
War As just a part of who we are.

340
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,620
Life.
It's,

341
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,730
it's really unfortunate that drugs 
really good,

342
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,140
but we're going to have to put you in a 
cage.

343
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:30,930
Yeah.
Oh,

344
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,360
it's,
I'm really sad that uh,

345
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:37,361
you know,
we've made a distinction that you can 

346
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:37,930
give someone a massage but you can 
massage their dick and we just,

347
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,490
we just don't like it doesn't,
it doesn't make us feel good.

348
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:45,040
So we'll put you in a cage to.
We were ridiculous animals.

349
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,570
We're reading our laws are ridiculous 
the way we enforce them.

350
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:49,740
It's ridiculous.
Every time turn around,

351
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:49,950
there's

352
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,160
a cop.
It's killing people that are either 

353
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,350
they're either it's accidental or it's,
it's they're using too much force,

354
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,000
but it happened so much that the 
accumulation of it is just bizarre.

355
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Like it comes at you like a storm,
like you can't believe this is as good 

356
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,980
as we are now with.
As much as we know we're still doing all

357
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:12,010
this shit.
Yeah.

358
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,140
We're still involved in some of the most
ridiculous crimes you read about members

359
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:16,960
of our,
our,

360
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,540
our race,
the human race,

361
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,750
performing fucked up ridiculous acts of 
barbaric behavior all over the world.

362
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,220
The Isis troops had showed up at that 
resident or that resort rather,

363
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:30,240
and just started gunning people down 
recently.

364
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,630
Those people are alive right now.
This version of a person is capable of 

365
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:40,431
that.
Not much different than a chimp with a 

366
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:42,441
gun.
Just wild rampaging chaotic primate 

367
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:46,110
jeans still fighting and shooting for 
beliefs,

368
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,610
killing,
killing,

369
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,880
killing other things because they don't 
believe what it believes or they.

370
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,330
They're in the wrong land that they've 
invaded holy land,

371
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,200
so they kill tack ripping bodies apart 
with bullets.

372
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,300
This is not a good model.
Okay.

373
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:02,010
There's too many of us that are fucked.
I mean,

374
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:03,570
yeah,
you could take a 19,

375
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:08,571
71,
a Ford Pinto or whatever the fuck year 

376
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:10,890
they built those things and do a good 
job with the brakes and you know,

377
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:12,270
and,
and tighten up the suspension,

378
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,740
but it's still a piece of shit.
Right,

379
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,340
okay.
Really,

380
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:16,820
it should become like a tesla,
you know?

381
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,660
If you had to compare the two of them 
and you go,

382
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:23,661
oh yeah,
that's what happens when they keep 

383
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:23,661
getting better and better and better.
You get one of these,

384
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:23,661
oh,
I get it.

385
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:25,200
I see the evolution,
but we.

386
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,230
How come you don't see that with people 
when people were stuck in this same 

387
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,531
shitty fucking hairless monkey body that
does a lot of dumb shit based on our 

388
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:34,470
biology.

389
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,330
I don't know.
I wish I did.

390
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:42,040
Now the robots are going to know well,
but if you do an analysis,

391
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,770
not just to the human part of the 
biomass,

392
00:19:44,771 --> 00:19:47,500
but if you do an analysis of a lot of 
the other parts,

393
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,460
you do witness incredible violence again
and again and again in the most extreme 

394
00:19:56,891 --> 00:20:01,891
way.
That is very similar to what you see 

395
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:03,340
isis doing.
If you watch a nature documentary,

396
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:08,670
you know,
I just had my friend Dustin on my 

397
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,580
podcast and he was talking about how 
he's having a great day.

398
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:14,110
Parked his car,
got out and loping across the road was a

399
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,200
coyote with a house cat in its mouth and
he could hear the bell,

400
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,670
the house cats.
Little Bell

401
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,830
is this house God is carrying this 
creature that has been or the rather the

402
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:36,080
coyotes carrying this creature that has 
been petted by children and loved and it

403
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:41,081
has a cute name,
bojangles or Mr sparkles that fucking 

404
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:45,771
coyote snatched the cat is carrying it 
off to to eat and in the woods and my 

405
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:50,770
friend was a little bummed by that,
but then I reminded him that fucking cat

406
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:56,190
carried in the mouth of that coyote has 
been eating birds all day long.

407
00:20:56,591 --> 00:21:01,000
Squirrel babies like some squirrel baby,
desperately clinging to a brand.

408
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:04,530
Is it staring up at it,
tumbling down to the groundbreaking.

409
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:09,590
It's spine and its last few moments in 
this dimension is the experience of the 

410
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,480
cat.
Disempowering it,

411
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,190
pulling its intestines out and letting 
it die in a very slow,

412
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,070
painful way.
That is nature.

413
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:19,930
I just read this quote,
don't know who said it.

414
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,320
Satan's church is nature.

415
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,660
So then so,
so nature evolves,

416
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:33,661
right?
And it becomes a human right and humans 

417
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:36,781
are just doing the same thing,
the same dance that nature is engaged 

418
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:36,781
in.
Humans are doing it.

419
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:41,611
Only the way they're doing it is with 
tools that have become more refined in 

420
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:43,900
the direction of creating the same kind 
of violence.

421
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:48,010
This is the Shiva energy.
This is the part of the cycle where,

422
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,240
uh,
where things get transformed from meat 

423
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,150
into dust.
And I don't think that it is a 

424
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,900
necessarily,
um,

425
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,770
I don't think that we need to feel 
ashamed of where we're at right now.

426
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,800
I think it's more like just acknowledged
that we seem to be part of the title 

427
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:13,351
flow of nature and that nature doesn't 
give a shit about the individual nature,

428
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:18,430
doesn't care about the individual 
nature,

429
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:23,230
cares about the whole.
And if you look at the entire biomass is

430
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:26,680
just this sort of Amoeba like thing.

431
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,680
And every single species is a 
promiscuous of the Amoeba shooting out 

432
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,511
into this dimension.
And kind of exploring it like the way a 

433
00:22:36,511 --> 00:22:37,090
cockroaches antenna scatter on the 
table.

434
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:42,091
Only the way this particular 
interdimensional probably outside of 

435
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:46,201
time,
cockroach is exploring this particular 

436
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:48,421
planet is not with like antenna.
It's with every single species that 

437
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:49,630
exist,
ants,

438
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,830
bees,
humans,

439
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,360
you name it.
Just all these things.

440
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:57,361
Exploring and exploring and exploring 
this dimension and through the 

441
00:22:57,361 --> 00:23:00,961
exploration of evolving,
it's like having a tool that you're 

442
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:05,341
using to scan a part of this table or 
it's like having a tool that you're 

443
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,770
using to investigate something that as 
you investigate,

444
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,980
the tool evolves too.
So that's what we're looking at is like 

445
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,200
we're getting better and better and 
better at exploring the deepest,

446
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:22,650
uh,
the deepest parts of the dimension that 

447
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,921
we currently happened to be in.
And the entire exploration is happening 

448
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:28,270
via all sentient forms of life.

449
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,600
And if you think that your one thing,
if you think you were in an individual 

450
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,041
and you've gotten confused and you think
that you're a person or permanently a 

451
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:42,481
person,
then you're in for a big bowl of 

452
00:23:42,481 --> 00:23:46,131
suffering brother because you're going 
to die.

453
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,270
Everybody knows going to die and you're 
not going to stick around.

454
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:55,271
You're just one little genetic piece of 
this incredible exploratory tool that 

455
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:59,720
the universe is extruding into this 
dimension,

456
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,930
and I think there's something very 
beautiful about that and for whatever 

457
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:05,630
reason is part of that exploratory 
process.

458
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:08,780
We're still blowing each other up.
That'd be nice if that stuff,

459
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,860
the exploratory process of becoming 
something other than a monkey,

460
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,700
which is what we all are.
We're all just like super smart monkeys 

461
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,480
with all these weird monkey instincts.
The weirdest thing about people to me 

462
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:26,430
and one I've been absolutely guilty of 
myself,

463
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:31,380
is how we divorce ourselves from nature 
in some strange way.

464
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,770
We separate ourselves from all these 
other things that exist on the planet to

465
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:39,150
the point where we feel it.
We have like an urge to save them.

466
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,650
We have an urge to save things that 
would kill you in a heartbeat.

467
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,050
Yes,
kill you in a heartbeat and but we don't

468
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:51,051
care.
We want to save them because they're a 

469
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:52,800
part of nature and nature's beautiful 
and we have this really weird,

470
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,160
bizarre distancing from the reality of 
this nature that we're protecting right?

471
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,470
Until it grabs you,
until it actually grabs you.

472
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,480
And wants to eat you and you realize 
like,

473
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,980
oh my God,
what have I done?

474
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,830
What have I done?
I thought it was protecting flowers.

475
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:13,250
I thought it was out there looking at a 
movie that was around me and three of 

476
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,130
them was actually in nature.
The real nature nature as described by 

477
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:17,490
science and what you're dealing with is 
like.

478
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:19,290
Did you hear about the lady from the 
game of thrones,

479
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:21,810
the editor that got killed by the cat 
yet?

480
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,790
She was at a safari and apparently she 
was working.

481
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,870
She was involved in conservation and she
was trying to protect a lot of different

482
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:32,820
animals.
I'm not exactly what the story was,

483
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:37,821
but she had her.
She had her window rolled down and they 

484
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:42,021
can't pull her out of the call.
Just she was taking pictures of it and 

485
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:42,240
she wanted to have the window rolled 
down.

486
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,880
You see people,
you know,

487
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:46,440
you look at them and they look like,
oh,

488
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:47,870
it's just a cat.
You know,

489
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:49,410
it's,
it's a big cat,

490
00:25:49,411 --> 00:25:51,990
but it's cool.
It's not going to do anything to us.

491
00:25:51,991 --> 00:25:54,260
It's just,
it's just going to let us know.

492
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,050
It might not.

493
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,290
Not a youtube video.

494
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,110
No.
It might not.

495
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,240
Sometimes they decide to.
Not Most of the time.

496
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:01,400
Yeah.
Like they have those damn fucking safari

497
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:02,420
car to.
Have you ever seen those?

498
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,590
They go around in jeeps.
He's Openair,

499
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:09,610
jeeps.
There's nothing that can stop the cat 

500
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:09,610
from going in and they say,
the cats just don't do it.

501
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,990
And I say,
what the fuck are you talking about?

502
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:15,200
They don't do it yet.
Jesus Christ.

503
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:17,690
All they have to do is do it once.
Just once you,

504
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,720
you,
you take these assholes with you out 

505
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:22,720
there in the safari.
Do you know these fucking people do?

506
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,400
Do you know how many times have you run 
into a guy that's willing to put 

507
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,490
everyone around him in danger because 
he's an idiot.

508
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,920
You know?
Really drunk,

509
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,230
ridiculous people that'll say stupid 
shit.

510
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,830
Provoke violence in a bar or something 
like that and could get everyone around 

511
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:38,960
you killed.
Yes.

512
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:44,050
I would happen to that guy in Africa.
What happened to that guy who gets a 

513
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:44,190
little drunk?
He goes on this fucking lion

514
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,050
safari.
Did they breathalyze him?

515
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,670
Do you know?
Who knows?

516
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:52,970
All you need is one fucking cat,
one cat two to bust a move on a dude,

517
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,140
and then they decide,
well,

518
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,210
this is what we do now.
This is what we do.

519
00:26:57,211 --> 00:27:02,211
They know how to do it,
and they all start jacking people for a 

520
00:27:02,211 --> 00:27:02,211
little while.
I mean,

521
00:27:02,211 --> 00:27:03,540
then they're just going to put 
plexiglass up in the bus,

522
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:06,570
but you're right for a little while.
It's funny for a little while.

523
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:09,570
It's going to be a fucking great week 
for cats.

524
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:10,530
You know?
It's funny.

525
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,910
Isn't it weird that I like a bad day for
her.

526
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:16,470
Human is often the best day for a shark,
like a bad day for a human.

527
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:21,471
It's like that lion,
that horrible thing that happened was 

528
00:27:21,471 --> 00:27:26,331
the best thing that ever happened in 
that line because it probably had been 

529
00:27:26,331 --> 00:27:29,040
like watching the monkeys go buy other 
lines.

530
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,190
It probably said to it,
now you can't eat a man.

531
00:27:32,191 --> 00:27:34,560
Trust me,
Jack tried a few years ago,

532
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,020
doesn't work.
It's just impossible.

533
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:39,780
Plus they taste like shit it don't do 
it,

534
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:41,310
man.
Just hunt antelope.

535
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:43,080
And one of them was like,
you know what man?

536
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,100
I've been reading Tony Robbins,
I understand that I don't have to allow 

537
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:54,771
another person's paradigm to influence 
my paradigm and some of the greatest 

538
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:55,170
inventors in,
in,

539
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:59,100
in the history of lions have been the 
ones I remember,

540
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:04,101
man,
there was a lion who figured out the 

541
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:04,101
first one to in an antelope.
Remember that guy?

542
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:04,590
We,
we,

543
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,080
he's in art history books.
Fuck it.

544
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,900
I'm going to go for it.
I'm going to put my ass on the line.

545
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:14,901
I might get embarrassed,
but I'm going to try to eat one of the 

546
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:14,901
monkeys.
Bam.

547
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,540
He did it.
I think it was a girl.

548
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,690
Well,
I mean that's.

549
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,800
I know hunter super advanced monkeys is 
what I'm saying.

550
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:22,590
The point is the cat.
What are all girls?

551
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,480
The girls will pick up on the last.
Oh,

552
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:27,570
I'm sorry for males don't really hunt.
Sorry about that.

553
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:29,520
That often.
I mean they will if they have to,

554
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,680
but for the most part this shit assets,
they just kick her out.

555
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:33,900
So she was just like,
you know what?

556
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:37,470
I'm going for it.
And she did it and she learned something

557
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:41,730
new and that particular tendril of the 
biomass figured out some new thing.

558
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,760
But unfortunately,
the way it figured it out was through 

559
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,800
horror and through catastrophe.
I mean,

560
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,740
all that stuff to me is,
um,

561
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,530
it really does bring to mind this 
incredible verse in the Bhagavad Gita 

562
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:04,341
where Krishna is revealing his true form
to our June who's like the warrior 

563
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:05,320
figure.
And uh,

564
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,440
this is Oppenheimer's quote.
This is Oppenheimer's quote,

565
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:12,030
when he,
that he said after the atomic bomb,

566
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,150
when I recorded this part of the 
Bhagavad Gita where he said,

567
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:17,580
I have become death the destroyer of 
worlds,

568
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,480
but it doesn't stop there.
Christian sang to Argentina,

569
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,690
something along the lines of,
look in my teeth there you will see 

570
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,010
them,
everyone on this battlefield because I'm

571
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,430
eating them right now.
So this is like,

572
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,680
this is like Christian being like,
oh,

573
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:39,681
you really want to see what I'm like,
because they've just been friends 

574
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:41,040
hanging out and stuff.
And he like suddenly became the force of

575
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,040
all destruction

576
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,190
in the known universe.
And the point of the thing was,

577
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:48,550
listen,
all of this is already chewed up.

578
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,120
It's already been devoured.
It's already gone.

579
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,430
Game over,
you're done.

580
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,010
No Kurzweil's going to get you new blood
cells.

581
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:59,050
It's going to keep going to keep you 
alive.

582
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:04,310
At some point,
I will come to you wearing the costume 

583
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,410
of your death,
and that is an inevitability.

584
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:10,500
So just surrender to that and you're 
going to be a lot less freaked out if 

585
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,140
you just accept that that's the way it 
is.

586
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:13,690
Because if you're a war that you're 
engaged in right now,

587
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,960
is the war to live forever.
If you're a war that you're engaged in 

588
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,951
right now,
is a war to try to make some lasting 

589
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:25,870
change in a universe that's defined by 
impermanence and change,

590
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,050
then you're fighting the wrong war.
There's a better war to fight,

591
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:34,051
you know,
and it's actually the way you fight it 

592
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:34,051
is by surrendering,
not by fighting,

593
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:38,080
by letting go and sinking into the 
actual hum of the universe,

594
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:40,330
the way it really works,
not the way you wish it were,

595
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,410
not the way that you were hoping that 
the universe worked where,

596
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,280
uh,
you know,

597
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:49,290
lions and hyenas rescue little boys like
an ice age,

598
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,260
but the cartoon,
but the way it actually works,

599
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:56,440
the way the universe actually works as 
everything comes into existence,

600
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,400
it exists for a little while and then it
dies

601
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,380
than most things come out of explosions 
and.

602
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,550
Oh yeah,
don't forget that.

603
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:09,551
Yeah.
Most things come out of big fucking 

604
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:09,551
blast,
including the whole universe itself.

605
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:12,080
The university itself is predicated upon
a violent event.

606
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,090
Yeah.
It has to have a violent event,

607
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,020
right?
That's big.

608
00:31:15,021 --> 00:31:16,370
Bang.
It couldn't be the,

609
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:21,610
the slow expansion of beautiful life 
giving particles throughout the universe

610
00:31:22,611 --> 00:31:23,330
now.
Nope.

611
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,800
It's a big fucking bang.

612
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,080
No,
it was a big fucking bang and it keeps 

613
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,080
it.
It keeps going.

614
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,790
The Big Bang keeps going and is,
but it's just like this man.

615
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:37,791
If you want to dig your heels in and 
sync your claws into the expanding 

616
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:43,260
universe and try to keep that fucking 
thing from expanding,

617
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,350
you're going to get ripped apart.
That's just the way it works,

618
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,890
but if you want to let go and merge into
the thing,

619
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:55,100
if you want to allow yourself the 
fantasy that you're not some individual 

620
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,890
with a social security number and a name
and parents,

621
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,160
but allow yourself that fantasy that 
you're 13 point 8 billion years old and 

622
00:32:01,201 --> 00:32:06,201
you're part of this incredible ocean of 
happening instead of just this one 

623
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:08,880
individual and just let yourself 
experience that for a second.

624
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:14,210
The glorious knowledge that you are a 
never ending ever changing flow of 

625
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:19,341
matter that's temporarily manifested 
with the ability to express love and do 

626
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:21,720
a dimension where things are supposed to
be cooling off.

627
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,020
Then that's a fun way to spend your time
here before you ended up getting eaten 

628
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,090
by a lion or have a heart attack or 
whatever happens.

629
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:31,740
It's just a backflip.
This is a.

630
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:37,130
This is like a high di.
This is like when you see people come 

631
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,190
off a high dive and you get like a few 
seconds to do some cool fucking tricks.

632
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,620
That's what you get here were like 
dolphins jumping out of the eternal and 

633
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,150
we into time and while we were shooting 
up into time,

634
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:49,520
we get a chance to do a couple of back 
flips,

635
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:54,521
a couple of Chirps,
and that's our life's work and then we 

636
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:55,220
plunged back into infinity again.
Do it all over again.

637
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,380
What do you think,
if any,

638
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,820
evolutionary advantages there are to an 
identity?

639
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,810
What?
What about us makes us not just identify

640
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:10,811
ourselves,
but define ourselves with a sound and a 

641
00:33:10,811 --> 00:33:11,390
symbol.
We have a series of sounds and samples.

642
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,100
Duncan trussell.
Yeah,

643
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,140
and there's all these letters and you 
arrange them in order.

644
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:18,950
You can even go all caps if you feeling 
gangster and that's you.

645
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,660
That's you.
That represents you.

646
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:21,580
It's your,
your human.

647
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,720
You could carry around you with like a 
little sign.

648
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,390
My name is Duncan trussell.
You know what I'm saying?

649
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,850
It's weird and it's the at the same time
where this animal is becoming ultra 

650
00:33:32,691 --> 00:33:37,691
advanced and is figuring out how to 
communicate and figuring out its 

651
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:41,201
position in the world around it and it's
also figuring out that this whole 

652
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:45,430
infinite world or infinite universe they
live in is almost impossible to 

653
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,540
understand and as it's figuring this 
out,

654
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:53,020
it's also figuring out that it needs 
community and it needs to be in these 

655
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,330
groups,
but somehow or another,

656
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,440
some program has been put in place to 
get you to work harder and try to 

657
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,100
achieve more by being defined by your 
name,

658
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:04,980
your role.

659
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,920
Wentworth,
son and Wentworth.

660
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:11,921
Work hard.
We built this company from the ground 

661
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:12,750
up,
yellow grandfather and I,

662
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,370
I worked in the mail room when I was 14.
You know what I'm saying?

663
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,580
It's like,
fuck that.

664
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,800
That's a,
that's a name.

665
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:20,240
And you know,
as Comedians,

666
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,840
you're know,
this is my Orisha fears,

667
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:24,760
but peering this week,
Brian,

668
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,330
red ban,
Wednesday night.

669
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,730
Come on down.
You know this is like these,

670
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,580
these symbols.
This is peg whitman.

671
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,150
Oh,
hi,

672
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:33,170
peg.
Nice to meet you.

673
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,710
My name's Mike Hunt and it's fucking 
bizarre,

674
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:37,770
right?
It's bizarre.

675
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,820
These weird conversations that we have 
with people where we give our moniker 

676
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:47,561
out in our definition and then under 
your definition you can list your 

677
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:47,750
accomplishments,
which is amazing.

678
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,180
Well,
I have a phd in anthropology.

679
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:55,181
I'm on the board of the [inaudible].
Remember when I graduated from him?

680
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,120
Boom,
boom,

681
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:56,570
boom,
boom.

682
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,150
Oh,
I see.

683
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,920
What do you do for a living?
Oh,

684
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:02,990
well,
I own a computer graphics company,

685
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:06,440
right?
Do all the animation for many films like

686
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:10,370
Jurassic Park,
and I've done this with my name.

687
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,530
Yeah,
and everybody's talking about how much 

688
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:15,530
have you contributed to this machine?
How much have you contributed?

689
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,830
How much you pulling out of the machine?
Are you pulling out shiny things?

690
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,980
You must be very valuable.
How many shiny things do you have?

691
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:27,100
How large is your domicile?
How big is the place where you call 

692
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,470
home?
How much zeros do you have?

693
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:32,730
Have you have you?
Have you extracted a lot from the 

694
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:32,730
system?
Yeah.

695
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,710
How have you figured out how to do this?
Mr Whitmore,

696
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,150
Mr Whitmore you bitch.
Wow.

697
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,370
I've been working

698
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,940
in the mail room since I was 14.
That's how I did it.

699
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,610
Oh yeah.
I made good choices.

700
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:49,611
I made a series of good discipline 
decisions in my life and I've learned 

701
00:35:49,611 --> 00:35:50,430
where I'm at.
That's why I have an island.

702
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,240
And Bernie Sanders.
Bernie Sanders.

703
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:55,980
What are you trying to say?
Bernie Sanders.

704
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,440
Damn hippies.
This is a,

705
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,800
this is what you're talking about here.
Uh,

706
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:03,360
is really fucking cool,
man.

707
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,160
It's the,
uh,

708
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,780
this is the,
uh,

709
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,040
where,
what do you identify with?

710
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:13,070
Right?
So you're trained to identify with a 

711
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,620
particular costume that you call your 
life.

712
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:18,950
And so most people have gotten really 
entangled and committed to that 

713
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,150
particular game of make believe.
So that's,

714
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,350
that's why,
you know,

715
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:24,800
most everyone is really engaged in their
personality.

716
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:26,880
They don't have to be a Mr.
Wentworth or whatever.

717
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,380
Whoever it more whitmore,
forgiving Mr Whitmore though.

718
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,460
Wentworth.
I forget,

719
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,960
I forget what his name is.

720
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,770
Mr.
Imaginary.

721
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,110
It is Mr.
Imaginary.

722
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:40,860
I mean,
that is the,

723
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:42,000
um,
the uh,

724
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,310
the,
the thing is,

725
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:45,490
it is,
it is now.

726
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,850
And,
and this is the Rom das quote.

727
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,640
We are all God and drag.
We're all,

728
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,740
we're all the universe,
just dress playing this incredible game 

729
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,240
of a cost.
We're,

730
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,290
we're at a costume party and that's part
of this dimension.

731
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,720
We're all wearing these funny costumes 
especially now,

732
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,960
but fuck man,
if I walk around in this ridiculous get 

733
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:11,960
up that I'm in right now in the right 
place,

734
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,630
people are going to come up to me and be
like,

735
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:17,631
father,
I'm having a problem in my life because 

736
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:18,720
they don't know and it's just a costume.
It's a ridiculous costume.

737
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,990
Completely meaningless.
And if I wear this to enough places,

738
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:26,991
people asked me about the drones and the
drone program or they'll try to buy 

739
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:26,991
ecstasy from it.

740
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:27,690
But yeah,
for sure man,

741
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,240
you're,
it's,

742
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,880
it's just a costume.
And,

743
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,960
and,
and so,

744
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:35,961
aside from these kinds of costumes,
the clothes that you wear to identify 

745
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:37,800
what particular part of the road,
what's up with your bus to choose?

746
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:38,430
Yeah.
That.

747
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,830
Oh fuck you.
Fuck you.

748
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,680
And then his pants.
Yeah.

749
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,010
What's going out?
Yeah.

750
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,560
Or don't sell basically wearing a 
fucking equinox hat.

751
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:51,561
Dude,
I wear an equinox hat and get made fun 

752
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:51,561
of it a lot.
But,

753
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,450
but,
but you were to like hipster place.

754
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:57,530
No,
I wear it everywhere because it's so 

755
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:57,530
embarrassing.
I wear it anywhere.

756
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,580
It on purpose.
I wear it on purpose.

757
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,640
I word on purpose and I will gladly,
gladly stick up for that fucking gym.

758
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,820
[inaudible] awesome.
Fucking jam.

759
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,750
Not Ashamed,
not sponsored by the.

760
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,150
But uh,
shout out to George.

761
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:15,930
Jen,
my trainer.

762
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:16,270
I love.

763
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,160
But anyway,
the uh,

764
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,660
the um,
the,

765
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,930
the,
the point is if you look underneath that

766
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:25,830
layer,
right?

767
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,500
That's where shit gets interesting 
because you're,

768
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:33,501
you're trying to go from the 
entanglement with your personality to 

769
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:39,050
recognizing that you're observing 
yourself in the same way you observe a 

770
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:39,050
pen.
Like if you sit,

771
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,480
if you look at a pen,
you're like,

772
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:41,080
Oh wow,
look,

773
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:42,310
here's a pen.
I can see it.

774
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:44,050
I can feel it.
I know what it is.

775
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:45,610
In the same way,
when you think,

776
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:47,200
God,
I feel like shit today,

777
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:52,530
you're observing feeling like shit.
You don't feel like shit any more than 

778
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,410
you're the pen.
You're just in the ear.

779
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:58,411
Experiencing it within your field of 
awareness is that thing that you call 

780
00:38:58,411 --> 00:39:01,540
feeling like shit or feeling happy or 
feeling sad or feeling good.

781
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:04,540
You're aware of it.
So now you've zoomed back a step,

782
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:04,870
right?

783
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,990
And you've become the observer,
the Ottman,

784
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,170
and that's what you truly are.
And that is known as the thing that you 

785
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,051
can't look at it.
That's the thing that is they can't see 

786
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:17,140
itself.
It only gazes is out.

787
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:19,570
It's also known as the watcher or the 
witness.

788
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,010
But that's what,
that's,

789
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,010
that's,
you know,

790
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:28,170
for me,
if I take the right quantity of lsd and 

791
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,510
I allow myself some time alone,
then I can merge into that state.

792
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,780
And that's the unified merging into 
everything as that people often report 

793
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:41,851
on a psychedelic experiences you popped 
backwards into instead of being the 

794
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,180
object or rather the subject and the 
object merge together.

795
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:51,181
So there's no more,
there's no more of that which is 

796
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,030
observed,
but only an everything this,

797
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:57,060
you know,
and that's what our personalities keep 

798
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,060
us from experiencing.
And a lot of in Buddhism,

799
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,100
a lot of people claim that we cling to 
our personalities.

800
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,130
Uh,
and the same way a person would clean to

801
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:08,131
a pole over a floor covered in razor 
blades because the experience of having 

802
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:15,330
a self or an identity for a lot of 
people is preferable to the experience 

803
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:20,881
of merging into everything because 
merging into everything is death and a 

804
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:24,400
lot of people don't want to die.
So it's really curious though,

805
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:26,800
you know,
there's a lot of like exercises designed

806
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:31,801
to move you out of that attachment to 
your bodily identification because it's 

807
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:32,490
not just what you're wearing.
It's your body.

808
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,940
People think their,
their body.

809
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,880
That's one of the first things you learn
as you're not your body.

810
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,190
You just think you're,
that's what you are.

811
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:41,110
You're not your body anymore than you're
a pen.

812
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:46,410
You're not your body anymore than you're
a airplane or you're not your body 

813
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,410
anymore than your,
your car.

814
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,730
It's just a vehicle within which you're 
currently experiencing the universe.

815
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:53,590
It's really trippy,
man.

816
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,850
It's really fucking tripping.

817
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:01,740
Being a human being and knowing that you
only have a certain amount of time here 

818
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,960
is the ultimate mind.
Fuck,

819
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,390
because you're also supposed to be doing
things,

820
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,760
but at the end of doing all those 
things,

821
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:11,960
if your body just stops working,
like what was really the point of this?

822
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:17,290
What was the point of this?
Is it to leave behind a lot of 

823
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:17,290
paperwork?
W,

824
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:17,570
W,
what's the point of this?

825
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:22,990
What is the.
What did you did you spread a lot of 

826
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:26,141
love,
like if you looked at people and you 

827
00:41:26,141 --> 00:41:31,120
were trying.
I mean if you tried to understand the 

828
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,070
all the major religions,
all the ideologies that human

829
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,030
beings subscribe to the varying ones all
over the world.

830
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:43,210
You looked at some key components and 
there's all the key components that are 

831
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,850
sort of undeniable and the good and evil
are in every one of them.

832
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,850
There's always good things to do and bad
things to do.

833
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,540
There's good and evil,
but if you.

834
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:54,800
If you looked at human beings,
I completely objective and you looked at

835
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:56,210
things like war.
If you could,

836
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,290
if you could look at the entire human 
race and then focus in on something like

837
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:05,291
Afghanistan and then have like a brain 
map that would show like all the 

838
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:09,491
thoughts involved of all the people all 
over the world that contributed to this 

839
00:42:09,491 --> 00:42:12,851
one event happening were explosions are 
going off and robots or flying through 

840
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:17,141
the sky and shooting rockets into 
villages indiscriminately at cell 

841
00:42:17,141 --> 00:42:20,251
phones,
like we all know that this really 

842
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:20,251
happened.

843
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:22,690
They use gps coordinates for cell phones
and rockets fired off a fucking drones 

844
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,250
buildings to get bad guys like,
whoa.

845
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,290
If you could look at that,
you would say,

846
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,850
oh,
that's the devil.

847
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,190
The Devil's talk.
These people into doing this,

848
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:36,220
and the devil is the devil.
A guy with a pitchfork and a fucking in 

849
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,750
a tale that has a little spade at the 
end of it.

850
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,230
No,
no,

851
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,590
no,
no,

852
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:39,950
no,
no,

853
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,160
no,
but the devil is his racism with the 

854
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,320
devil is his xenophobia with the devil 
is.

855
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:50,321
Is there any sort of hate of someone 
just because they're different or they 

856
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:53,921
grew up different than you?
It's the devil's fee or the devil's 

857
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:53,921
insecurity.
The Devil's greed,

858
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:56,630
the devil's oil.
The devil wants nuclear proliferation.

859
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:01,040
The devil wants to get rid of 
environmental protection.

860
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:06,250
The devil is human behavior at its worst
and he figures out how to get through 

861
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,880
there while these fucking people are too
lazy.

862
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,450
See Donald trump talking about Mexicans 
and they kicked him off at NBC.

863
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:13,310
They banned them from NBC.
What did he say?

864
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,020
He's got a fucking show at NBC.
He's on this fucking th.

865
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:16,350
Th.
Th.

866
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,980
The,
the apprentice is a big show,

867
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,310
right?
What did he say about Mexicans?

868
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:25,340
It was talking about the rapists.
Like he was talking about like the 

869
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:25,910
protecting the border.
He said a bunch of ridiculous shit,

870
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:31,230
but he was talking about how some of the
people that come across the border from 

871
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:31,460
Mexico are rapists and everybody's like,
Jesus,

872
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,000
man.
I mean,

873
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:34,290
like he said a bunch of like really 
crazy shit.

874
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,490
Did he say it?
He said it.

875
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,030
He didn't gave a press conference.
You haven't heard it?

876
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,130
No.
Jamie played that.

877
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,140
The highlight.
Just the highlight of it.

878
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,810
The one that we were looking at earlier.
That's so funny.

879
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,510
Just throw a press or you weren't 
looking at it with me.

880
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:49,640
I was looking at it with the guys from 
the video game this morning.

881
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,690
The highlight of,
uh,

882
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,720
of Donald Trump's speeches.
They took like a,

883
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,350
they clipped,
edited over and over again,

884
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:58,790
like the most ridiculous shit that he 
said.

885
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,160
So Mr Trump,
if we're taking you out of context,

886
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:03,530
I apologize in advance.
I did not edit this.

887
00:44:03,531 --> 00:44:05,540
Nor do I endorse us.
If you wanted to,

888
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:10,570
could you throw a press conference?
I'm sure you could throw a press 

889
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:10,570
conference as well.
Duncan trussell.

890
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:15,370
That is the most amount of how many 
people would do this thing to throw a 

891
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:18,851
fucking press conference.
Like you have something that important 

892
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:20,180
to George Clooney threw a press 
conference when Princess di died.

893
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,440
Really?
Yeah.

894
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:23,750
Like to stop the Paparazzi from 
following through.

895
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:28,780
He had a postcard.
Well that's a good reason for good 

896
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:28,780
reason,
right God for,

897
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:33,130
I mean for a sinking mom.
And I thought it was just gonna like 

898
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,470
going to say at the press conference he 
gave like a very sentimental thing about

899
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:35,990
how he just love Princess Diana.

900
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,530
Could you imagine?
No,

901
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:40,860
he was trying to raise awareness for 
these bags.

902
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,010
These pop Razzi guys are apparently,
they would just follow her like madness.

903
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:44,900
It was crazy.
Yeah,

904
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,850
it was just follow her everywhere and 
they're speeding and they were dangerous

905
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,040
and,
but um,

906
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:55,330
can,
can keep up the point being the idea of 

907
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:55,330
like love,
like that exists too.

908
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,310
You know,
like you could,

909
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:59,400
you could look down and you could find 
like the best behavior.

910
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:00,780
You could find a,
you know,

911
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:06,390
a father and son hugging and laughing 
and smiling together and just pure joy.

912
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,330
You could see a mother and daughter 
kissing,

913
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,330
holding hands,
cuddling this insane,

914
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:13,660
pure love,
right?

915
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,480
You could see that too.
And you could say,

916
00:45:15,481 --> 00:45:16,350
well,
there's God.

917
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:17,990
Yes,
God,

918
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:19,530
there's God.
There's the best thing.

919
00:45:19,531 --> 00:45:22,950
We can be the best thing I could.
The feeling of being in love,

920
00:45:22,951 --> 00:45:27,951
the feeling of loving children,
the feeling of being like completely 

921
00:45:27,951 --> 00:45:29,850
fulfilled and happy in brief bursts of 
time.

922
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,670
It doesn't.
Nobody has it all the time now,

923
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,300
but you have it.
If you're in love with someone,

924
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,380
you know,
everybody gets that.

925
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:39,381
It doesn't matter if you're rich.
It doesn't matter if you're successful 

926
00:45:39,381 --> 00:45:42,470
if you don't have that one moment where 
you really enjoy being with someone who 

927
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:44,640
really enjoys being with you and you 
have this like a rush of love,

928
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,530
whether it's your family,
with your mom,

929
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:47,950
seeing senior mother,
even your dog,

930
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:48,780
you know,
whether yeah,

931
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:49,220
man,
any.

932
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,580
No,
not your dog.

933
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:52,770
It's not strong.
I,

934
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,630
you know what,
I disagree.

935
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:57,600
I fundamentally disagree with you on 
that point.

936
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,200
I don't think that there's any hierarchy
when it comes to love and I and,

937
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:05,520
and I think a dog is like having a love 
heater and your house.

938
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,690
Well,
I definitely love dogs.

939
00:46:06,691 --> 00:46:07,560
Do.
Don't get me wrong.

940
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:12,950
The difference between the love that you
have for a dog and the love that you 

941
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:12,950
would have for your daughter is 
monumental.

942
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:17,750
It's so hard to grasp until the,
and I don't like to pull that card like 

943
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,990
you don't know until it happens to you,
man.

944
00:46:18,991 --> 00:46:23,991
You don't know.
Nobody's putting their daughters to 

945
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:26,241
sleep.
It's just a little human being that 

946
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:26,241
you're raising and your communicate 
with.

947
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:29,310
You have those very insane connection 
with them and it it,

948
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:34,311
it gives you this weird empathy for all 
the rest of the people in the world 

949
00:46:34,311 --> 00:46:37,450
because all the sudden they start to 
look like children like they,

950
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,950
they,
everyone to me is a child that became an

951
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:43,080
adult.
Whereas they used to just be adults that

952
00:46:43,081 --> 00:46:44,870
used to exist in a static state.
Yeah.

953
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,820
You would meet the 60 year old douche 
bag and you go,

954
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:49,710
this will.
This guy's a fucking piece of shit.

955
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,120
That's just who he is.
Well,

956
00:46:51,121 --> 00:46:56,121
yeah,
but how did he become this 60 year old 

957
00:46:56,121 --> 00:46:56,121
piece of shit?

958
00:46:56,121 --> 00:46:56,121
This,
this 60 year old piece of shit was a six

959
00:46:56,121 --> 00:47:00,441
day old baby.
At one point there was a series of 

960
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:00,600
events.
There's shit genetics.

961
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:02,910
There's poor upbringing.
This bad environment.

962
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,640
There's fill in the blanks.
So that led to this guy being an asshole

963
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:07,500
in front of you.
Sixty years old.

964
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,720
Yes,
but you're.

965
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,530
You're not thinking of that when you 
meet him,

966
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:11,460
you're just thinking,
well,

967
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:14,100
here's an asshole with almost every 
asshole.

968
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:19,101
Almost every person that you run into is
a victim of a series of events that have

969
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:23,130
brought them to this point,
and for some people it's just an.

970
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,630
It's a,
it's undealable.

971
00:47:24,631 --> 00:47:27,210
They've lost so many times.
Like if you play video games,

972
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,100
okay,
say if you and I played video games,

973
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,390
I don't play starcraft.
If I play starcraft with you,

974
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:34,660
I'd probably get my fucking ass beat 
over and over and over and over again.

975
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,130
So bad I would.
I'm sure I would be.

976
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,280
So it'd be frustrated and be like,
fuck dude,

977
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:41,070
I don't want to do this anymore.
Well,

978
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:46,080
some people that's life.
Some people life is giving them the real

979
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:49,960
life everyday beating that you don't 
even liking a video game.

980
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,940
Video Games are fun,
you know,

981
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:55,150
but if you're playing a video game,
you're just getting someone just running

982
00:47:55,151 --> 00:47:56,950
you down.
It's not fun.

983
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,750
It's not fun because you don't get any 
of the joy.

984
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,740
You get all the losing in life.
Some people,

985
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:06,070
that's their fucking shitty hand that 
they're dealt and before you know what?

986
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:10,330
They're 13 and now they're in high 
school and they're just beat down by all

987
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:15,331
the bullshit they've experienced their 
whole life and then they get to high 

988
00:48:15,331 --> 00:48:19,681
school and now there's bullies.
Now there's girls and now girls fucking 

989
00:48:19,681 --> 00:48:19,681
hate them.
Oh Great.

990
00:48:19,681 --> 00:48:20,140
It gets even worse.
Oh,

991
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:21,970
now I have a boner that nobody wants to 
deal with.

992
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,880
You just that's,
that's the game.

993
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:30,060
This is the game of life and sometimes 
people come in and they just spawn in a 

994
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,960
shitty area with a real weak gun and 
they like,

995
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:36,961
fuck.
You may have to run from the fucking 

996
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:39,550
respond spot to find a better gun on him
and put it all together and some of them

997
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:42,130
die along the way.
That's just the reality.

998
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:42,810
That's true.

999
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,210
A lot of people have a very rough man 
and a lot of people that,

1000
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:50,390
you know,
a lot of people listening to this are so

1001
00:48:50,391 --> 00:48:55,391
fucking hard on themselves and they 
don't apply the exact same thing that 

1002
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,360
you're saying to apply to other people 
do their own lives.

1003
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:01,510
Like so many people feel so guilty.
So like they wake up in the morning and 

1004
00:49:01,611 --> 00:49:06,611
they think about some dumb fucking thing
they did whenever they did it for 

1005
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:10,151
whatever dumb reason,
and they feel all this guilt and they 

1006
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:13,211
walk around like a dog with a droopy 
tail because they don't think they 

1007
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:16,931
deserve love.
And so I think that you to get to the 

1008
00:49:16,931 --> 00:49:18,560
place you're talking about,
which is a fucking awesome place,

1009
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:24,160
empathy for all human beings,
loving everyone to the best of your 

1010
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,420
ability.
You got to start with the person closest

1011
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,020
to you,
right?

1012
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,990
And that's your you.
That's your life.

1013
00:49:29,991 --> 00:49:32,810
Like you have to figure out a way to sit
down,

1014
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:36,500
take an appraisal of your life.
Don't skip anything,

1015
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:41,501
don't ignore anything.
Look at the whole way that you're 

1016
00:49:41,501 --> 00:49:44,021
playing the entire game and understand 
that all the things that you've done 

1017
00:49:44,021 --> 00:49:47,861
that are stupid,
what the fuck did you expect yourself to

1018
00:49:48,891 --> 00:49:53,891
do?
Like you're temporarily existing in a 

1019
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:56,531
dimension that is actively destroying 
you and every single moment you're not 

1020
00:49:56,531 --> 00:49:58,640
going to be perfect.
Give yourself a break.

1021
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:01,190
So you start with that and then once you
start,

1022
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,550
you know when whatever the.
Everyone's got a thing and I'm right.

1023
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,420
Everybody has a thing inside of them 
they don't like about themselves.

1024
00:50:08,421 --> 00:50:13,421
Maybe not you,
or maybe that thing has been reduced to 

1025
00:50:13,421 --> 00:50:13,421
some degree,
but a lot of people,

1026
00:50:13,421 --> 00:50:15,620
they think they're too fat.
They think they're too thin.

1027
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:20,620
They think that their tattoos,
socks or they regret the way that they 

1028
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:24,041
treated their parents or they feel like 
they're not far enough ahead in their 

1029
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:24,590
career.
Whatever the fucking thing it is,

1030
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:29,591
man,
everybody has this aspect of themselves 

1031
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:30,030
that really unhappy with.
So if you.

1032
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,290
What if you.
If you get really honest about the parts

1033
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:34,640
of yourself,
you're unhappy about,

1034
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:40,330
the new will.
Be excited to learn that you've been 

1035
00:50:41,811 --> 00:50:46,811
being attacked by those aspects of 
yourself in the form of everyone you 

1036
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:50,111
think's an asshole.
So it's like you're projecting those 

1037
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:50,630
parts of yourself out onto the world.
So all the people where you're like,

1038
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,370
man,
that guy's a fucking douche bag.

1039
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,640
Why would he ever fucking act like that 
and can't believe that guy did that 

1040
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,581
fucking shit?
If you stop and think really hard about 

1041
00:51:00,581 --> 00:51:04,121
yourself,
you'll discover that you are guilty of 

1042
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:05,150
those very same crimes generally,
and if you weren't,

1043
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:06,380
you wouldn't even notice it.

1044
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,050
You just are seeing parts of yourself 
you can't quite address.

1045
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,280
So the optimistic thing about this 
concept of loving everyone or getting to

1046
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:16,940
the place of loving everyone is that if 
you can figure out how to love yourself,

1047
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,480
it's very similar to wiping dog shit off
your shoe because if you have dog shit 

1048
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:25,430
on your shoe,
everywhere you go,

1049
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:30,431
smells like shit.
And if you allow yourself that delusion 

1050
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:33,710
that the reason everywhere it smells 
like shit is because dog shit must be on

1051
00:51:33,711 --> 00:51:35,840
every single surface and this entire 
planet.

1052
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,490
Then you're going to be in hell.
But what a glorious moment when you look

1053
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:41,530
at your shoe and you're like,
oh,

1054
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:46,870
just shit on my shoe.
The entire planet isn't covered with 

1055
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:46,870
Shit.
It's actually just shit on my shoe.

1056
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:51,110
And like in the same way,
once you recognize that there's a little

1057
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:56,111
piece of Karmic dog shit that's gotten 
stuck inside of your life,

1058
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:01,660
and instead of hating that piece of dog 
shit by torturing the people around you 

1059
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,380
and manifest the same propensity you 
dislike and yourself,

1060
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:08,770
you forgive that part of yourself and 
actively learn to love it or at least 

1061
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:13,481
just understand that it's there because 
it was trying to protect you when you 

1062
00:52:13,481 --> 00:52:17,171
were a kid and it manifested as a 
callous to keep you from whoever was 

1063
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:17,171
fucking with you.

1064
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:20,240
And that's why you don't like it.
It'll shift a little bit,

1065
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:25,241
man,
and you will notice a significant 

1066
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:26,540
reduction in swarms of assholes that 
were previously surrounding you.

1067
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:30,080
It's a fascinating thing.
Suddenly people just stopped bugging you

1068
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:33,140
as much and that's because you've gotten
into yourself and you said,

1069
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:36,170
I love you.
You did the best you could do.

1070
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,950
You didn't know you're half asleep.
You're a fucking drunk.

1071
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,800
So do you think,
do you attract assholes when you,

1072
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:48,010
you have this feeling or do you think 
that if you,

1073
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,520
if you allow yourself forgiveness,
that you will relax and you will feel 

1074
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:58,771
different with how you interact with 
people and then people will have a less 

1075
00:52:58,771 --> 00:53:00,440
assholes reaction to you?
Like is it,

1076
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,240
I love to believe that,
that you just said,

1077
00:53:03,241 --> 00:53:05,100
I love to think that.
I'm sorry.

1078
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:06,630
Are you skeptics out there?
Man,

1079
00:53:06,631 --> 00:53:08,640
please correct me on this.
I know I'm wrong.

1080
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,880
Someone's already corrected me on this,
but I love the observer effect concept 

1081
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,511
that the tool actually seems to be 
having an effect on the experiment and 

1082
00:53:17,511 --> 00:53:17,740
that,
uh,

1083
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,590
you know,
that's been explained to me.

1084
00:53:19,591 --> 00:53:22,980
If I can buy my friend j dot who's an 
actual physicists dammit,

1085
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:25,620
here.
And what he said by secret,

1086
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:31,070
he said that it's really a disingenuous 
comparison because when you are 

1087
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,060
measuring something and you're saying,
well it's,

1088
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,190
it's different,
and then you measure it,

1089
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:40,430
well you're,
you're involving some sort of form of 

1090
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:40,430
measurement,
some sort of tool.

1091
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,900
It's interacting with that and it's 
changing what it is.

1092
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:48,170
He's like this idea that it's the 
observer and you have some sort of a 

1093
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:51,200
cycle that it's disingenuous because 
you're observing it and in the process 

1094
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:53,820
of observing the way he's describing it 
to me,

1095
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:56,100
and I'm sure I'm butchering it,
I wish I call him right now,

1096
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:01,670
but just observing it itself,
like you're measuring it in the process 

1097
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:01,820
of measuring it,
you're,

1098
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,000
you're,
you're changing,

1099
00:54:03,001 --> 00:54:05,370
you're interacting with this level.
You've got to change it.

1100
00:54:05,371 --> 00:54:07,320
Just the one how you're interacting with
it,

1101
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,910
right?
Otherwise you couldn't be measuring it.

1102
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,570
Well,
okay,

1103
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,820
here's another that makes sense.

1104
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,720
Yes.
That's how he described it to me.

1105
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,330
Another way to put it would be human 
beings,

1106
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,630
an energy form right there,
just an energy form,

1107
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:23,010
and if you react with energy in varying 
ways,

1108
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:25,530
it's going to change the way that it 
interacts with you.

1109
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,920
That's just how it works.
So if you like,

1110
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:30,720
if you're on ecstasy,
right?

1111
00:54:30,721 --> 00:54:34,890
Let's say you've taken a nice dose of 
mdms and you'd go out into the world,

1112
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:37,980
just run your errands on ecstasy,
don't drive getting you up or whatever.

1113
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:40,650
So now you're feeling so great,
affable,

1114
00:54:40,651 --> 00:54:45,651
empathetic,
and you're smiling and you might notice 

1115
00:54:45,651 --> 00:54:49,041
that as you go through the world,
people are going to be smiling back at 

1116
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:52,281
you because you're putting out such a 
good vibe that people are going to be 

1117
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:52,890
responding to that vibe.
Maybe they won't know why.

1118
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,280
It's like,
I'm think we've talked about this in 

1119
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,080
your product asked before,
but I've actually heard that and I'm 

1120
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:00,870
going to butcher this quote and I don't 
know fucking said it,

1121
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:05,160
but something along the lines of the 
earth is like a dog.

1122
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,610
And if you know,
if you're afraid of the universe,

1123
00:55:08,611 --> 00:55:11,670
it'll snarl and attack.
But if you love the universe,

1124
00:55:11,671 --> 00:55:14,130
it'll roll over on its back and show you
its belly.

1125
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:18,720
And in the same way I think that if you 
go into the world with this love in your

1126
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:23,721
heart,
then for whatever reason people sense 

1127
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:23,880
that maybe it's a pheromone you're 
releasing.

1128
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:28,881
Maybe it's the particular an effect that
you have who knows affectation,

1129
00:55:29,011 --> 00:55:32,100
but they you're going to change the 
world around you.

1130
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,600
You know,
I think,

1131
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,600
I think that whatever that the reason 
for that is,

1132
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:41,930
I'm sure you could come up with it 
depending on what your particular field 

1133
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:45,530
of or your particular interest is.
You can go down to the level of the 

1134
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:49,731
secret and say that the fact that you 
are loving everything is transforming 

1135
00:55:49,731 --> 00:55:53,781
everything into love.
Or You could go to a sociological 

1136
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:53,910
perspective,
which is that you just figured out a way

1137
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:58,911
to manipulate your species by putting 
out a kind of happy pheromone that makes

1138
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:03,330
people trust you and less likely to 
attack because they're not on guard.

1139
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,400
You get to pick which way you want to 
look at it,

1140
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:10,401
man,
but there's no question about it that 

1141
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:12,740
that totally makes sense in some way,
so it totally makes sense in some way 

1142
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,370
that the actual pheromone or the actual 
vibe,

1143
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,600
whatever you want to call it,
whatever,

1144
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:19,140
however you're taking it in,
the perception that you get about people

1145
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:22,860
like the friendlier in the kinder and 
the nicer you put out,

1146
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,070
the more you're going to run

1147
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,230
into people that respect and respond to 
you that way.

1148
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:31,260
That's fine.
Think about the way you respond to some 

1149
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:31,260
people like you have some people in your
life.

1150
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,980
You know that you,
any one person,

1151
00:56:32,981 --> 00:56:35,440
pick them that you love to see.
When you see him,

1152
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:40,441
you have this big great because you know
that he's going to always going to be 

1153
00:56:40,441 --> 00:56:43,201
really cool with you.
You're always going to be really cool 

1154
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:43,201
with him.
When you meet each other,

1155
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:43,630
it's all gravy.
It's all like super,

1156
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:45,730
super powerful happiness.
Now,

1157
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,670
when you know that,
like if you're with that person,

1158
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,290
if you're with a group of people that 
are really,

1159
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,100
really close friends like that,
you have this like no fear,

1160
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:58,300
great feeling bond going right,
but you don't have that with people that

1161
00:56:58,301 --> 00:57:00,250
are strangers.
You don't have that with the rest of the

1162
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:01,510
universe,
but it is possible.

1163
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:04,480
So it is possible to achieve with a 
small group of people.

1164
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:07,630
If you come to an understanding and 
you're both completely cool about shit,

1165
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:12,790
you're both completely honest about shit
and you both go through this life like 

1166
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:17,581
you.
This is the attitude is not all about 

1167
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:17,581
me.
It's all about all of us.

1168
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:20,971
It's all about everybody.
It's all about doing the most positive 

1169
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:24,031
that you can into spreading the most 
good vibes that you can and putting out 

1170
00:57:24,031 --> 00:57:24,340
the most fun that you possibly can.
Well,

1171
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:29,341
if you can possibly do that.
This we're not talking about putting a 

1172
00:57:29,341 --> 00:57:30,520
robot on Mars like this is all shit that
I could figure it out.

1173
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:32,330
This is all shit that you can figure 
this out.

1174
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:32,920
I mean,
this is.

1175
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,350
This is stuff that wouldn't be that 
hard.

1176
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:37,450
If you're not in jail and you're not a 
murderer,

1177
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:38,990
a rapist,
you delegate.

1178
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Total complete piece of shit would not 
be that hard to turn your life around 

1179
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,900
and get yourself to a point where 
you're.

1180
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,890
You're not shitty to people.
That's right.

1181
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,700
That's not hard to imagine that people,
even people that have been involved with

1182
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:54,790
petty crime or forgery or whatever the 
fuck it is,

1183
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:59,791
just if they just stopped doing all that
and started treating all the people 

1184
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:02,350
around them as if it was them living 
another life.

1185
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:07,890
That's not that hard to imagine.
It's only hard to imagine if everyone's 

1186
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:10,390
like clawing and scratching and trying 
to make it to where end,

1187
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:14,680
dealing with the effects of a shitty 
childhood,

1188
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:18,670
which is Goddamn almost everything for 
most people.

1189
00:58:18,671 --> 00:58:23,671
It's the number one trip up mind fuck 
programming gone badly from the 

1190
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:27,460
beginning and it's so hard to erase the 
hard drive,

1191
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:31,060
reformat the discs and do it correctly.
So fucking hard.

1192
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:31,440
Dude.

1193
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:37,120
This is why we have therapy,
right?

1194
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,510
That's the like you can like their.
This is why people go to therapy because

1195
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:44,440
those guys are really good at getting 
you to swim down into your childhood and

1196
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:46,660
find the place where you got the.
You know,

1197
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:52,110
you generally you're going to get one of
two teachings.

1198
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,160
You're going to a few different 
teachings from growing up,

1199
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:59,161
but one of the teachings a lot of people
get is that there's not enough milk in 

1200
00:58:59,561 --> 00:59:04,561
the netball.
They get some version of that which is 

1201
00:59:04,561 --> 00:59:04,600
like the food's going to run out.
The loves getting run out.

1202
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:05,350
The,
you know,

1203
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:09,430
this is not a safe environment.
Your mom and I are working really hard,

1204
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:12,400
but we don't have enough money and we 
can't make ends meet and sometimes we're

1205
00:59:12,401 --> 00:59:17,401
not gonna have enough and I can't afford
to get you the stuff the other kids get 

1206
00:59:17,401 --> 00:59:18,820
and I'll tell you why because my boss,
Mr.

1207
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,270
what was the name you gave that guy?
Start what?

1208
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,070
My boss.

1209
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:25,220
Mr Whitmore is a fucking asshole.
Yeah.

1210
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:30,221
Whitmore sort of a bit.
She's given me too many hours and he's 

1211
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:30,770
not giving me a fucking raise and so 
life sucks.

1212
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:32,630
Do you understand it?
Shut up and look at me.

1213
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:35,360
You Little Shit.
Have you been smoking fucking weed?

1214
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,030
Do you not understand how dangerous this
world is?

1215
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,580
A lot of people get that and they come 
out of their,

1216
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,880
their family life,
like somebody you just got flown in from

1217
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:47,060
fucking Afghanistan.
They have a kind of PTSD.

1218
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,900
They don't understand what,
uh,

1219
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:54,460
they don't.
They don't understand that the universe 

1220
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:54,830
is ambivalent.
It's not malicious.

1221
00:59:54,831 --> 00:59:57,380
It's ambivalent.
It's the best.

1222
00:59:57,381 --> 00:59:59,790
It's ambivalent.
And if it's low,

1223
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,230
if the universe is the universe has some
agenda,

1224
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:05,030
will fuck.
Let's just give up.

1225
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:10,060
There's no free will.
But if the universe is just to kind of 

1226
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,870
chamber within,
which we can experiment with manifesting

1227
01:00:11,871 --> 01:00:16,871
whatever our goals happen to be,
then it's not that the universe is out 

1228
01:00:16,871 --> 01:00:17,420
to get you no matter where you're at.

1229
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:22,770
In fact,
your conceptualization of the universe 

1230
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:25,211
is a thing out to get you is only 
reaffirming that awful version of the 

1231
01:00:26,451 --> 01:00:31,451
universe that got crystallized in your 
head a way back when and now you're 

1232
01:00:31,451 --> 01:00:33,230
always trying to be right.
That's another thing.

1233
01:00:33,231 --> 01:00:37,010
People in rough families,
they're always trying to be right.

1234
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,200
They want to be fucking write about 
everything.

1235
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:44,380
You know,
they want to assert their will be right 

1236
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:47,500
in there and because there are a war 
because they feel like if they're not 

1237
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:47,500
right,
then they're vulnerable.

1238
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,730
So the next time,
here's a fun fucking experiment.

1239
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:53,480
I know you already do this man,
but I've been try playing around with it

1240
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,670
the next time someone does something 
wrong to you,

1241
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:01,420
really wrong.
Like someone does something wrong to 

1242
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:03,971
you.
The thing that you're always fighting 

1243
01:01:03,971 --> 01:01:06,191
back against and always being right when
you the next time you've been wronged 

1244
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:11,850
for real,
where you could easily say to the 

1245
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:11,960
person,
this is fucked up what you did to me and

1246
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:12,680
here's why.

1247
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:18,220
Let them be right.
Just play around with losing and not 

1248
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,970
even though you know that you're right,
play around not being right.

1249
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,160
Surrender.
Watch what happens.

1250
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,650
Just love them,
love them and be wrong.

1251
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,750
Let them think they're right.
Love them.

1252
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:28,910
Let let them work through whatever it is
they're working through.

1253
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,890
Watch what happens.
It's the weirdest,

1254
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,970
weirdest thing,
man,

1255
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,930
because it's like all of a sudden this 
into so many people are vengeance based.

1256
01:01:35,931 --> 01:01:38,300
You know I'm going to get you.
Fuck with me.

1257
01:01:38,301 --> 01:01:39,450
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you,

1258
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:40,850
motherfucker.
I'm going to get you one.

1259
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:41,780
I'm going to get you.
You did it.

1260
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,830
Oh,
I got you.

1261
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:44,840
I got you.
Good.

1262
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:48,980
Stopped taking revenge.
The next time you get a chance.

1263
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:51,440
Be merciful even though the person 
deserves it.

1264
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,930
Just be merciful.
It's a really fun experiment.

1265
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:59,200
It's really fun and you'll like the 
weight that gets lifted off of you in 

1266
01:01:59,200 --> 01:01:59,200
that moment.

1267
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,280
I,
I stopped drinking recently and I was 

1268
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,450
drinking too much man.
I was drinking like every night,

1269
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:08,090
a couple of beers and I was like,
yeah,

1270
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:09,650
yeah.
Did it creep up on you?

1271
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,920
Yeah.
Creeped up and I realized know I started

1272
01:02:12,921 --> 01:02:17,840
training with Justin and a quick things 
creep up on you though.

1273
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,070
Yeah,
they creep up.

1274
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,790
You've had a couple of things creep up 
on you.

1275
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:24,540
Right?
Well that's the alcohol like creeped and

1276
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:29,541
all of a sudden I was drinking every 
night and I was kinda getting used to 

1277
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:30,270
the idea of waking up with a hangover 
and like it was bad.

1278
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:32,250
Uh,
so I told me like,

1279
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:35,520
you can't have certain pills around or 
you'll just keep eating.

1280
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:37,180
That's my problem.
That's,

1281
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:42,260
that's actually a problem.
And it's a blessing because like if I 

1282
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:42,770
get addicted to something healthy,
I get really addicted to.

1283
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:48,340
The problem is it's easier to get 
addicted to things that aren't healthy 

1284
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:48,340
for you.

1285
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:48,660
So like,
yeah man,

1286
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:50,070
I realized like,
you know,

1287
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:53,320
I wasn't like Charles Zbikowski,
I wasn't even drinking vodka.

1288
01:02:53,321 --> 01:02:58,321
I was like,
it was just a very subtle thing I was 

1289
01:02:58,321 --> 01:02:58,470
doing where every night I'd have two 
beers,

1290
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,920
maybe three beers,
sometimes it wasn't like I was getting 

1291
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,711
hammered,
but every night I was putting alcohol 

1292
01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:06,711
into my bloodstream with great 
frequency.

1293
01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:07,320
Right.
And so,

1294
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:08,280
you know,
I,

1295
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:13,550
I've been thinking a lot about the 
concept of the human life as being kind 

1296
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:20,661
of out chemical experiment.
Like your body is like a beaker and 

1297
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:25,670
everything that you eat and everything 
that you witnessed and everything that 

1298
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:28,731
you hear,
whatever enters into your sensory input 

1299
01:03:28,731 --> 01:03:31,761
is like an additive that you're in.
You're putting into this mix and the mix

1300
01:03:31,981 --> 01:03:35,760
that you're creating is.
It depends on what you want to create,

1301
01:03:35,761 --> 01:03:39,660
but what you definitely don't want to 
create in that mix is sadness,

1302
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,770
horror,
depression,

1303
01:03:40,771 --> 01:03:41,880
anger,
bitterness,

1304
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:42,570
loneliness.

1305
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,450
For me,
I'd like that mix to be health,

1306
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,020
happiness,
amplification of my ability to love,

1307
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:50,580
forgiveness,
all that kind of stuff.

1308
01:03:50,581 --> 01:03:55,581
So from that Pov,
I was noticing that when I was drinking 

1309
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,580
my ability,
my ego is flaring up a little bit.

1310
01:03:59,581 --> 01:04:01,730
I found myself,
uh,

1311
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:06,090
just kind of in a,
in what if I continued that path,

1312
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:11,540
you know,
if I kept drinking and drinking and 

1313
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:13,371
drinking and drinking,
I could just see where it would take me 

1314
01:04:13,371 --> 01:04:15,120
a and I didn't want to go there.
So anyway,

1315
01:04:15,121 --> 01:04:18,630
I stopped drinking and started doing 
this kind of like observation of the way

1316
01:04:18,631 --> 01:04:20,760
I feel now that I'm not drinking.
Right.

1317
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:25,490
And one thing I've noticed is that when 
I go out to a club or a bar where are,

1318
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:30,510
wherever there's alcohol and I don't 
drink about like 10:00

1319
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:34,890
or 11:00,
my body feels so good.

1320
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,510
Like all of a sudden my body is like,
wait,

1321
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:37,650
why do we feel so good?

1322
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,300
What the fuck is going on?
Man?

1323
01:04:39,301 --> 01:04:41,310
I feel this.
I feel really good.

1324
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:42,990
And I think that like,
why do I feel so good?

1325
01:04:42,991 --> 01:04:43,710
It's like,
oh,

1326
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:46,110
you don't have two beers in your fucking
system.

1327
01:04:46,111 --> 01:04:51,111
Your blood sugar's not thrown off.
You don't have like this like flammable 

1328
01:04:51,111 --> 01:04:54,801
liquid coursing through your body.
That's considered to be one of the most 

1329
01:04:54,801 --> 01:04:56,490
dangerous drugs that currently exists on
the planet that we're on.

1330
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,650
And I feel awesome in the morning.
Oh,

1331
01:04:58,651 --> 01:05:00,210
you wake up,
my God damn man.

1332
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:02,250
What a great night's sleep.
Weird.

1333
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,190
You don't have a flammable fucking 
liquid in your stomach being.

1334
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:06,620
You know what I mean?
Like,

1335
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,270
oh wow.
Not to be disgusting,

1336
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:11,120
but shit man,
my back,

1337
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,800
my fucking shit man has gotten 
healthier.

1338
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:14,780
And then you're like,
oh,

1339
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,950
everything's better.
Oh Wow.

1340
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,610
Weird.
What a shocker.

1341
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:23,611
Huh?
That fucking fermented wheat juice 

1342
01:05:23,611 --> 01:05:24,610
you've been dumping into your fucking 
mouth for the last year,

1343
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,760
five times a week was fucking up your 
body dumbed dum.

1344
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:33,480
And so,
so,

1345
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:36,280
so.
So did we choose.

1346
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:37,990
That's really what it is.
So,

1347
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:38,800
so,
so,

1348
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:43,801
uh,
so it's really cool because not only do 

1349
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:44,140
you get to do that,
but you get to watch what happens to the

1350
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:48,340
fibers of the fermented wheat juices 
that hours of the night tick on.

1351
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,560
And you watch these people,
you know,

1352
01:05:50,561 --> 01:05:55,561
gradually transformed from like really 
fun people into the Goddamn walking 

1353
01:05:55,561 --> 01:05:56,650
dead.
Like you see this very slow,

1354
01:05:56,890 --> 01:06:01,060
weird tumble and do some version of a,
of ego,

1355
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:06,061
you know,
so it's a really fun thing to do all 

1356
01:06:06,061 --> 01:06:06,990
these things as an experiment don't 
take.

1357
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:08,530
You don't have to get all heavy about 
it.

1358
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:09,760
She's like,
I'm going to do an experiment.

1359
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:11,560
I'm going to watch what I'm like when I 
drink.

1360
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:13,720
I'm going to watch what I like when I 
don't drink.

1361
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,520
I'm going to pick which one I liked 
better.

1362
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,830
And right now,
not drinking Dunkin.

1363
01:06:17,831 --> 01:06:21,850
I like a fuck load better than drinking.
So much more fun.

1364
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,970
But to wrap this thing up,
forgive my rant.

1365
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:30,240
What I noticed is if I get my,
that I have an addiction to being right,

1366
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,800
that I have an addiction to getting 
revenge,

1367
01:06:32,801 --> 01:06:36,430
that I have an addiction to making sure 
that like,

1368
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:37,120
uh,
you know,

1369
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:42,121
I'm,
I come out on top of whatever the 

1370
01:06:42,121 --> 01:06:42,121
fucking thing is.
Not In an extreme way,

1371
01:06:42,121 --> 01:06:42,121
but like,
you know,

1372
01:06:42,121 --> 01:06:44,050
if I feel like I've been wronged,
I'm going to let you know.

1373
01:06:44,051 --> 01:06:45,310
Man,
I'm going to let you know.

1374
01:06:45,311 --> 01:06:47,440
Right,
so if instead of doing that,

1375
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:52,441
I stopped that game.
I've stopped that game whenever I 

1376
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:52,870
stopped that game.
Wow.

1377
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:57,930
It's exactly like when I'm not drinking 
like where there normally is a fight 

1378
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,670
where there's normally some bit of 
awkwardness or uncomfortableness or just

1379
01:07:00,671 --> 01:07:04,660
a general diminishing a experience of 
the universe.

1380
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,340
There's this.
Oh Wow.

1381
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,010
I don't have to punish.
You don't have to get you back.

1382
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,770
I don't have to get revenge.
I don't have to say anything.

1383
01:07:11,771 --> 01:07:16,771
I can just sit here and love you and 
this moment will pass and everything 

1384
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:18,850
continues to be cool.
The universe doesn't fall apart.

1385
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:23,620
My belly doesn't get ripped open by the 
clause of my enemy.

1386
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:27,310
I don't have to get revenge.
I don't have to become like the beast of

1387
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:32,311
the field and tear everything apart.
I can actually just love things and in 

1388
01:07:32,311 --> 01:07:37,081
general,
loving them is going to do a hell of a 

1389
01:07:37,081 --> 01:07:39,511
lot more for transforming them into 
something a kinder than me telling them 

1390
01:07:40,361 --> 01:07:40,900
they suck.

1391
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:46,570
I mean,
there are definitely exceptions to this 

1392
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:46,570
rule,
but for the most part,

1393
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:49,490
most exchanges that people have with 
each other,

1394
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:54,380
our our exchanges is two people giving 
out two different personalities,

1395
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:59,410
exchanging expression.
The way they talk to each other is 

1396
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:03,371
dependent upon the way the other person 
reacts and it's the volatile 

1397
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:05,690
combinations are oftentimes more than 
one person's fault.

1398
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:11,050
It's not.
There's not a lot of people have to be 

1399
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:11,900
on board with this for it to really 
work,

1400
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:14,870
but it's absolutely possible that it can
work.

1401
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,010
The idea

1402
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,620
that we're supposed to be constantly in 
conflict with each other.

1403
01:08:18,621 --> 01:08:23,621
Like I can't tell you how many people 
that I know that are in relationships 

1404
01:08:23,621 --> 01:08:25,390
that accept yelling and throwing shit at
each other.

1405
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:30,860
You know,
can you imagine if you had a buddy and 

1406
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:30,860
he just yelled at you all the time and 
threw shit at you.

1407
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:30,920
You'd be like,
dude,

1408
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:36,220
what the fuck man,
you gotTa stop yelling at me and 

1409
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:36,220
throwing shit at me.
Put your fist up.

1410
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:37,520
You're going to hit me like,
I don't want to be around you.

1411
01:08:37,521 --> 01:08:38,470
I don't do that to you.
Like,

1412
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,480
this is crazy.
It's this got to be some sort of a 

1413
01:08:43,821 --> 01:08:48,821
fundamental change in how people look at
each other and until,

1414
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:54,310
until that happens,
we're still going to get tricked by 

1415
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:55,640
being from a certain,
being proud of being from a certain city

1416
01:08:56,030 --> 01:09:01,030
or being proud of being from a certain 
state and then in competition with the 

1417
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:02,750
other states in competition with the 
other cities and the other countries,

1418
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:04,820
they could suck it because look at Toby 
Keith said,

1419
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:06,070
you know,
run,

1420
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,960
you know all that nonsense.

1421
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,330
It's all whole,
all of it.

1422
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,550
This is just,
it's just people,

1423
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:14,540
man,
you know,

1424
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,430
like I'm not necessarily on a team with 
you.

1425
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:21,790
You know,
we're all trapped in this one continent 

1426
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:21,790
together and we should be cool with each
other and we should,

1427
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,710
but we should be on team world.
Is America the shit?

1428
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:29,740
Of course it is.
It's a great place for anybody who says 

1429
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,430
America is not an amazing spot for a lot
of different shit is out of their mind.

1430
01:09:31,431 --> 01:09:36,431
You have to be a hater.
You have to be a hater to not look at 

1431
01:09:36,431 --> 01:09:38,801
the insane amount of accomplishments 
that have come out of this spot that 

1432
01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:39,800
have nothing to do with you or I have 
nothing to do with us.

1433
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:42,380
Just completely objectively.
We didn't even exist.

1434
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:45,980
We were just a computer analyzing be 
human life on this planet.

1435
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:49,520
You would have to say the United States 
is to shit on because if you weren't,

1436
01:09:49,521 --> 01:09:50,180
you'd be lying.

1437
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,670
Okay.
But the idea that somehow or another,

1438
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:54,960
the United States is important and that 
Africa is in,

1439
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,680
is important in Antarctica is,
and,

1440
01:09:56,681 --> 01:09:58,010
and this is important,
but that isn't,

1441
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:00,350
and this is more important than that.
And these people have our land.

1442
01:10:00,351 --> 01:10:01,480
They're like,
whoa,

1443
01:10:01,481 --> 01:10:02,600
Whoa,
whoa.

1444
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:04,760
Who is we?
And they and our,

1445
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:10,030
you know,
there's a human beings interacting with 

1446
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:10,030
each other.
What are you saying?

1447
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:10,030
They can't live here and you can't live 
there.

1448
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:12,980
And what fucking government owned what 
patch of dirt?

1449
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:17,150
And they get to instill Sharia law.
What the fuck are you doing?

1450
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:22,690
God Damn that.
The problem is the organization of all 

1451
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:24,830
these different human beings under 
various groups,

1452
01:10:24,831 --> 01:10:26,780
whether it's the group called the city 
of the group,

1453
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:28,880
call it state of the group called a 
country.

1454
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:33,440
That's where shit gets fucked and then 
you rely on the morals and the intellect

1455
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:38,441
of a handful of leaders to guide the 
entire fucking set of laws that govern 

1456
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:41,780
this patch of land.

1457
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:47,250
Millions and millions of people tend to 
either we let the terminator be the 

1458
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:51,311
governor of California.
That should be enough to and he didn't 

1459
01:10:51,311 --> 01:10:51,500
do a bad job.
Not Bad at all to do a bad job.

1460
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,420
He did a lot better job than other 
folks,

1461
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:56,210
whether I'm not dissatisfied with a 
terminator.

1462
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,500
He was a good governor.
The La River in particular,

1463
01:10:59,501 --> 01:11:03,020
you did some good stuff.
I mean he daddy's got assigned by the La

1464
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:08,020
River,
so I guess that means you did something 

1465
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:08,020
to it.
The way he describes it,

1466
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:10,991
he says like the bureaucracy of 
government was just insanely 

1467
01:11:10,991 --> 01:11:11,600
complicated.
Like there's no way to get through it.

1468
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:13,920
It's like the way they had.
They would say,

1469
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,660
look,
that would be logical,

1470
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:18,090
but we can't do it that way,
so if you bring this up,

1471
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:23,120
I'm going to oppose it because it 
benefits my constituents that I oppose 

1472
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,340
it and then we'll debate and it'll just 
get pushed under the rug and go away and

1473
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:27,630
that's how we do it and they squash 
things that way and they.

1474
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:30,390
And so this is a handful of people that 
are,

1475
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:35,420
that are moving around all these core 
parts of our society and changing weird 

1476
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:41,451
laws and instilling new regulations and 
charging taxes and figuring out all this

1477
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:43,040
weird shit.
Yes,

1478
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:45,450
and this is a fucking.
Are there hundred of them?

1479
01:11:45,451 --> 01:11:46,860
A few hundred of them.
It's crazy.

1480
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:52,130
The idea.
A few hundred people could say it's a 

1481
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:53,400
thousand a thousand people at the top of
the heap in California.

1482
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:58,610
Can,
you can make laws for the other $30 

1483
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,090
million they can.
That's crazy.

1484
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,390
It's fucking nuts,
man.

1485
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:06,800
It's nuts that to imagine that that's 
how that human hive currently is 

1486
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,881
functioning,
is that we assigned various queens and 

1487
01:12:10,881 --> 01:12:10,881
kings,
you know,

1488
01:12:10,881 --> 01:12:13,490
he gave people,
we assigned people out of power and,

1489
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:14,820
and,
and worship.

1490
01:12:14,821 --> 01:12:19,821
Those people and hilarious ways and like
how cops fall into this horrible trap of

1491
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:24,750
being involved in constant conflict,
back and forth,

1492
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:29,751
constant conflict,
and they get used to this position of 

1493
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:32,721
power and they get confused by this 
position of power and this position of 

1494
01:12:32,721 --> 01:12:35,100
being constantly in conflict and then 
they come into things charged.

1495
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:40,570
Somebody.
Government people in government are 

1496
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:40,570
probably a lot the same way.
You get someone,

1497
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:41,280
you give them a position where they're 
in charge.

1498
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:44,300
Like Lyndon Johnson back in the sixties 
when he didn't have.

1499
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:49,450
You weren't really as responsible today 
for every single thing you say or do 

1500
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,670
mean he could get away with a lot of 
shifting shit back then.

1501
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,090
And that guy was a scary dude.
Yeah man.

1502
01:12:57,190 --> 01:13:00,300
That to go back to the beginning,
part of that,

1503
01:13:00,301 --> 01:13:02,390
the cop example,
uh,

1504
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,080
and why cops act the way that they act.
Somebody,

1505
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:12,081
you know,
I was doing a real shrill hippie rant 

1506
01:13:12,081 --> 01:13:13,830
against cops and a man as really being 
self righteous.

1507
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:17,130
And I really got into full,
like trussell shrill,

1508
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:19,890
raspy lesbian.
This is an outrageous thing that airline

1509
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,270
did.
And then somebody said this to me,

1510
01:13:22,271 --> 01:13:22,800
he's like,
Hey,

1511
01:13:22,801 --> 01:13:27,801
I want you to imagine this man.
You have your wife is you have a 

1512
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:34,610
pregnant wife at home and some guy that 
has got bad tags or whose car matches an

1513
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:42,750
amber alert car,
whose car matches the car?

1514
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:47,751
If somebody you killed some people a few
weeks ago drives in front of you,

1515
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,940
and your job is to pull that person 
over.

1516
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,210
That person decides he doesn't want to 
pull over.

1517
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:59,450
So now you've got to chase this fucking 
person because if you don't chase this 

1518
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:03,291
person,
there's a possibility he's going to do 

1519
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,881
something else in the world and you're 
going to have to deal with that guilt 

1520
01:14:04,881 --> 01:14:07,850
for the rest of your life because you 
didn't catch this guy could have been 

1521
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:07,850
this person.
See,

1522
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:08,880
he chased this fucking person.
High speed,

1523
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:12,010
fucking chase down the interstate.
You look down at

1524
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,260
your cell phone for a second.
It's your wife calling.

1525
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:19,470
She's pregnant.
You have a pregnant fucking wife and 

1526
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:21,751
you're driving a hundred and 15 miles 
per hour down the interstate to chase 

1527
01:14:21,751 --> 01:14:26,131
some fucking asshole.
He's not pulling over who very 

1528
01:14:26,131 --> 01:14:29,131
potentially as a weapon and they're 
going to shoot you and your son or 

1529
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,430
daughter is going to grow up without a 
daddy.

1530
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:34,900
So when you finally get that person or a
group of your best friends,

1531
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:39,930
get that person pulled over,
it's going to be safe to say that your 

1532
01:14:39,930 --> 01:14:43,390
adrenaline levels are going to be at 
African bull.

1533
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:48,450
Elephant level off the chart.
Your pulses pounding and you're gonna.

1534
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:53,550
Get out of the fucking car and you're 
not going to think probably unless 

1535
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:55,570
you're a zen master and you have full 
control over yourself.

1536
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,840
Like if you've ever gotten road ridge 
where you've screamed at someone just 

1537
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:00,840
for cutting you off.

1538
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:05,850
Think about the rage you would 
experience once you finally tackle 

1539
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:10,081
somebody who just almost killed you and 
a bunch of innocent people trying to 

1540
01:15:10,081 --> 01:15:12,820
cross the street and a high speed 
pursuit.

1541
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:18,330
You are going to be angrier than you've 
ever been in your fucking life.

1542
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:22,510
And so I mean,
to maintain that kind of like calm,

1543
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:28,050
placid professionalism that you're 
supposed to maintain when every part of 

1544
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:32,581
your body is telling you to kill this 
threat and your life is not exactly the 

1545
01:15:32,771 --> 01:15:36,700
easiest thing ever.
I'm not excusing cop violence.

1546
01:15:36,701 --> 01:15:38,230
I'm just saying if you really look at 
it,

1547
01:15:38,231 --> 01:15:41,560
you can empathize with why you as an 
individual,

1548
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:46,561
if you put yourself in that position,
might not be able to stop your elbow 

1549
01:15:47,021 --> 01:15:52,021
from landing on.
That person's back a little harder than 

1550
01:15:52,021 --> 01:15:52,021
it needed to because you're fucking 
pissed.

1551
01:15:52,021 --> 01:15:54,190
Right?
So somebody explained that to me.

1552
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:55,360
It's like,
oh shit,

1553
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:56,230
of course.
Yeah,

1554
01:15:56,231 --> 01:15:58,210
I do understand that.
You're right.

1555
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:01,630
Still wrong.
Still cops shouldn't beat fucking people

1556
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:04,750
up and a lot of times they do it.
It's obviously associate bath.

1557
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:10,020
He's gotten the job of a cop,
but a lot of times it's somebody who 

1558
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:10,150
really got into the job because they 
were like,

1559
01:16:10,151 --> 01:16:15,151
fuck man,
I don't want to do good things in the 

1560
01:16:15,151 --> 01:16:16,000
world and they're not perfect.
We got to lighten up a little bit.

1561
01:16:16,001 --> 01:16:17,790
I got to lighten up a little bit.
I got like,

1562
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,680
I think it's a job that almost no one's 
qualified to do.

1563
01:16:20,681 --> 01:16:22,930
Right.
I think that you could talk to a guy.

1564
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:26,140
I know a dude who got mugged once and he
has ptsd,

1565
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:28,810
like it freaks them out of kids not 
married one time.

1566
01:16:28,811 --> 01:16:33,811
We got mugged one time and you know he 
has what he calls post traumatic stress 

1567
01:16:33,811 --> 01:16:33,811
disorder.

1568
01:16:33,811 --> 01:16:34,750
It,
it changed his life.

1569
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:40,200
Like you mentioned,
we ain't a fucking cop and every single 

1570
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:40,780
goddamn day you're dealing with a new 
guy who got shot in the face,

1571
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,570
a new woman who got run over by a truck,
a new this,

1572
01:16:43,571 --> 01:16:46,600
a new that,
a new extreme violence,

1573
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,570
a new horrible accidents,
all that shit.

1574
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:54,780
You're constantly dealing with this 
barrage of terror of terror and then 

1575
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,760
you're not even getting paid that much.
Right?

1576
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:58,390
You get,
you get 50 grand a year,

1577
01:16:58,391 --> 01:17:00,010
60 grand a year at the most.
I mean,

1578
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,700
how much does a starting cop in La make 
pretend?

1579
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:08,880
Let's pretend it's 100,000
dollars a year because it's not that 

1580
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,140
you.
Would you be willing to get $2,000

1581
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:13,260
a week for people to shoot at you?
He'd be like,

1582
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,190
how many more weeks can I collect this 
money coming for?

1583
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:21,250
How many more weeks?
How many weeks can you collect that 

1584
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,861
money right before you're dead,
before you get shot in the head by some 

1585
01:17:23,861 --> 01:17:28,210
dude who hates cops has been in jail his
whole life because his fucking parents 

1586
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:31,901
were criminals.
He was born into a criminal 

1587
01:17:31,901 --> 01:17:31,901
neighborhood,
is constantly around crime and violence.

1588
01:17:31,901 --> 01:17:36,761
He was abused from the time he first 
popped out of his mother's pussy and 

1589
01:17:36,761 --> 01:17:40,071
needs just doomed just on doom street 
and you just want to get home to your 

1590
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:40,071
kids.
Good luck.

1591
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:41,360
And that's every day.
That's it.

1592
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:42,120
Yeah,
that's real.

1593
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:45,590
It's fucking really starting.
Pay is 57,000.

1594
01:17:45,591 --> 01:17:47,780
Four hundred and 10.
That's private for taxes.

1595
01:17:47,781 --> 01:17:50,150
I don't know if they pay taxes.
They pay taxes,

1596
01:17:50,151 --> 01:17:50,870
right?
Man,

1597
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,500
it's complete you.
Of course I do that.

1598
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:53,720
They can pay taxes.
They do.

1599
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:58,721
Scientology does.
Galleries there are called the cult of 

1600
01:17:58,721 --> 01:17:58,721
police,
but no,

1601
01:17:58,721 --> 01:17:59,030
but they.
They pay,

1602
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,310
they pay taxes,
but scientology doesn't.

1603
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:03,430
That's hilarious.
That's hilarious.

1604
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,090
That's hilarious.
As a religion,

1605
01:18:05,091 --> 01:18:10,091
as an entity,
obviously the police department as a 

1606
01:18:10,091 --> 01:18:12,431
state to get funded by the state because
I feel like I'm not an anti cop person 

1607
01:18:12,431 --> 01:18:12,440
at all.
Now.

1608
01:18:12,441 --> 01:18:16,430
I know I have a lot of friends that are 
cops procop I 100 percent.

1609
01:18:16,431 --> 01:18:19,070
Am I just as a human?
I don't.

1610
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:24,071
I just don't think most humans are 
qualified to deal with the stress that 

1611
01:18:24,071 --> 01:18:27,761
comes with that job.
There's a few men luke's out there that 

1612
01:18:27,761 --> 01:18:27,761
can fucking handle it.
There's a few clinics.

1613
01:18:27,761 --> 01:18:29,930
What's out there?
The Big John McCarthy,

1614
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:33,590
the guy who the referee for the UFC,
like I seen everything.

1615
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:38,740
He's seen everything.
He'll tell you some crazy fucking 

1616
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:38,740
stories.

1617
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:38,740
Beach,
cool shit.

1618
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:39,880
You can hang with him.
He doesn't have any posttraumatic.

1619
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:40,820
Nothing.
He's fine.

1620
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,220
He just deals with reality,
mean deals.

1621
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:46,040
In reality,
all it means a referee for Nma.

1622
01:18:46,041 --> 01:18:48,440
The best ever in his spare time,
you know?

1623
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:49,970
I mean that's what he does for,
for a goof.

1624
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:52,510
Keep himself occupied.
You know?

1625
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,620
I mean,
that guy's seen fucking everything,

1626
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:59,650
but he's cool shit.
I had breakfast with him the other day 

1627
01:18:59,650 --> 01:18:59,650
in Mexico.
No idea that guy was that.

1628
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:02,090
That's what he did.
Great God damn stories.

1629
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,660
That's my point being he can handle it,
but he's an exceptional dude.

1630
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:07,340
You know?
He's an exceptional.

1631
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:10,070
He's an exceptionally mentally strong 
person too.

1632
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:11,780
For a lot of people.
Man,

1633
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:13,310
it's just too much.
And then on top of that,

1634
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:15,080
you know,
for a lot of people they're dealing with

1635
01:19:15,081 --> 01:19:17,300
that and then their personal life is 
chaotic.

1636
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:19,940
Maybe they married the wrong person,
maybe their families,

1637
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,930
maybe they got a brother that's fucking 
crazy or they got.

1638
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:24,800
Who knows,
who knows,

1639
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:29,830
who knows?
There's so many variables that people 

1640
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:31,841
have to deal with and the idea that you 
would give one civilian who's not a 

1641
01:19:32,511 --> 01:19:37,511
monk,
you haven't reached some 10th level of 

1642
01:19:37,511 --> 01:19:40,451
enlightenment that you could show me 
that you can be completely without 

1643
01:19:40,451 --> 01:19:41,210
judgment and treat everyone with 
kindness and love.

1644
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,200
No,
no.

1645
01:19:42,201 --> 01:19:47,201
You're just a guy who just a regular guy
and then you put in this position where 

1646
01:19:47,201 --> 01:19:50,681
you get a gun,
you get a gun and you get a walkie 

1647
01:19:50,681 --> 01:19:50,681
talkie and you're in a.
you're in a.

1648
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:52,460
it's like a gang.
I mean,

1649
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:57,490
being a cop is like a bean in a positive
gang and you're going out there and 

1650
01:19:57,490 --> 01:20:01,331
you're doing battle with all the 
negative gangs and there's a bunch of 

1651
01:20:01,331 --> 01:20:04,841
them and you know you've got to make 
relationships and sometimes you gotta 

1652
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:04,841
put your foot down some pop.

1653
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:09,280
Sometimes you get a drag.
Someone's fucking ass to jail to teach 

1654
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:09,690
you a goddamn lesson.
Be throwing people in.

1655
01:20:09,691 --> 01:20:14,691
Paddy wagons,
you become in conflict professionally 

1656
01:20:14,691 --> 01:20:18,530
with a group of people who are just 
trying to scratch out survival through 

1657
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:22,521
crime.
The scariest people you could come in 

1658
01:20:22,521 --> 01:20:25,341
contact with ever,
especially if you're some fucking white 

1659
01:20:25,341 --> 01:20:26,730
dude from Pomona with Chubby cheeks and 
you just can't figure out another way to

1660
01:20:26,731 --> 01:20:31,731
make a living and then all of a sudden 
you're involved with really hard people 

1661
01:20:31,731 --> 01:20:36,650
that have grown up in hard neighborhoods
and they will fucking sucker punch you 

1662
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:37,620
and take your gun in a heartbeat and 
that's just.

1663
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,800
You're dealing with the wrong people.
They've already accepted the fact 

1664
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:42,800
they're going to go back to jail.
Do you understand that?

1665
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:43,890
They've been there.
They've been there.

1666
01:20:43,891 --> 01:20:46,530
They went through juvenile hall.
They might've gotten raped in Juvi,

1667
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:51,680
okay,
these are wild people in a lot of 

1668
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:51,680
situations you're dealing with when 
you're dealing,

1669
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:56,391
when you're on a crime call,
like say if you're responding to some 

1670
01:20:56,391 --> 01:20:59,511
home invasion or you're responding to 
someone breaking into some building and 

1671
01:20:59,511 --> 01:20:59,850
looting and robin or something like 
that,

1672
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:02,400
who knows what kind of human beings are 
encountering,

1673
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:05,100
who knows what kind of history they have
in the penal system,

1674
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:10,020
having been tortured and shoved into 
these cages and turn into worse,

1675
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:13,560
scarier criminals and then released 
after time served,

1676
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:17,070
good luck Johnson out there on the mean 
streets of Los Angeles,

1677
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:22,520
you know,
and then you get out there and you got 

1678
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:22,520
to stay in a halfway house.

1679
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,200
Wherever the fuck you have to do and you
don't have any job prospects and next 

1680
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:29,091
thing you know you're involved again and
you've accepted the fact that you're a 

1681
01:21:29,091 --> 01:21:31,671
fucking criminal.
And the cops would come and they didn't 

1682
01:21:31,671 --> 01:21:31,671
hold me off the fucking jail and they 
start shooting.

1683
01:21:31,671 --> 01:21:35,190
The moment they see you,
they think about that time in the cage.

1684
01:21:35,191 --> 01:21:40,191
You think about all the fucking kids 
that raped him in juvenile to think 

1685
01:21:40,191 --> 01:21:43,761
about every horrible thing that's ever 
happened to them and they unload with 

1686
01:21:43,761 --> 01:21:44,940
their gun on you gang gang,
and you're a little trouble.

1687
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:48,570
Chubby Pomona face starts going Pale 
because you're bleeding out.

1688
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,560
Wow.
Yeah.

1689
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:52,350
Your hands on somebody's squad car.
Yeah.

1690
01:21:52,351 --> 01:21:54,450
You eyeballs blown out the back of your 
head.

1691
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:55,500
You realize you have a hole in your 
head,

1692
01:21:55,501 --> 01:22:00,501
but you're still seeing how your left 
eye and you watch your life slip away 

1693
01:22:00,501 --> 01:22:00,501
from you.

1694
01:22:00,501 --> 01:22:01,980
Why?
Because you've got the wrong gig.

1695
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:04,170
Every.
Everybody that's a cop has to think like

1696
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:04,680
that.
Man.

1697
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:08,100
Those possibilities aren't just.
It's not just.

1698
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:10,020
It could happen.
It has.

1699
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:13,230
It absolutely does.
There's so many cops get murdered on the

1700
01:22:13,231 --> 01:22:14,220
job.
So many.

1701
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:16,530
There's so many.
There's so many videos of it.

1702
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:20,330
You know the idea that all these cops 
that have killed people or senior,

1703
01:22:20,331 --> 01:22:25,331
really the problem,
there's a whole big problem and the 

1704
01:22:25,331 --> 01:22:25,331
problem is the way human beings treat 
each other.

1705
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:28,620
The need for cops in the first place is 
the problem.

1706
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,110
Before the idea of cops being the 
problem.

1707
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:36,500
I mean,
everybody wants to look at police 

1708
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,631
violence for good reason.
It's a very important subject right now 

1709
01:22:38,631 --> 01:22:41,810
for all of us,
especially when it has connotations of 

1710
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:44,760
when it's got connections to racism.
It's got connections to sexual issues 

1711
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,250
was also,
you know,

1712
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:50,270
when you,
when you see a man punch a woman in a 

1713
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:51,000
situation where you probably don't think
he would punch a guy,

1714
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:53,910
you know there's.
There's a lot of weird shit that happens

1715
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:56,670
with police officers interacting with 
human beings.

1716
01:22:56,970 --> 01:23:00,960
The idea that anybody is qualified to 
hold that position and have that kind of

1717
01:23:00,961 --> 01:23:03,880
power just by being a regular guy.
Good luck,

1718
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,500
good luck,
good luck,

1719
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:10,360
good luck trying to do that,
but the problem is that it exists at all

1720
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:15,361
that we needed it all.
The problem is that there are all these 

1721
01:23:15,361 --> 01:23:17,911
crimes.
The problem is that we do beat each 

1722
01:23:17,911 --> 01:23:20,041
other up.
You do have domestic violence issues 

1723
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:20,041
where you show up and some guys beating 
his wife up.

1724
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:23,290
Those are real.
You really are going to encounter that.

1725
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:28,470
Those are really the problems.
The fact that we need police at all are 

1726
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:29,890
the problem.
It's these issues,

1727
01:23:29,891 --> 01:23:31,180
these,
these events,

1728
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:31,770
these,
these,

1729
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,630
these patterns of human behavior that 
are horrible,

1730
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:37,600
where were horrible to each other.
Those are the fucking problems.

1731
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:42,750
Everything from that is just the wrong 
solution to deal with that problem.

1732
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:47,600
One of the wrong solutions so that just 
about anybody be a cop and you give them

1733
01:23:47,601 --> 01:23:52,601
a gun and you give them some training 
and you send them with their weak 

1734
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:56,370
fucking character out there in the world
because not everybody's big John 

1735
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:56,830
Mccarthy.
There's a lot of bitches out there.

1736
01:23:57,010 --> 01:24:00,370
There's a lot of dudes that get to be a 
cop and there really are a bitch.

1737
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,720
Right?
And that's a fact.

1738
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:05,170
And if you put that guy in a stressful 
situation where it's all going down,

1739
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,600
he's gonna probably fucking panic.

1740
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:10,560
Like that pool party,
that legendary pool.

1741
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:11,880
You saw that pool party,
right?

1742
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:14,700
Where the cop,
like there's some girl in a bikini,

1743
01:24:14,701 --> 01:24:17,600
throws her to the ground.
He does that barrel.

1744
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:21,090
He comes in with a barrel.
It's so fucking hilarious.

1745
01:24:21,091 --> 01:24:23,280
Like this is his dream.
That is the problem.

1746
01:24:23,281 --> 01:24:27,240
It's like not everybody's becoming cops 
for the exact same reason,

1747
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:32,570
but what you just did,
all of that man is really important 

1748
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:35,460
because it helps people empathize with 
most of them.

1749
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:37,740
And that's the ticket right there,
man.

1750
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:42,800
We've got to learn how to empathize.
They've got to learn how to empathize 

1751
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,071
with us too,
like they've got to understand that a 

1752
01:24:46,071 --> 01:24:46,071
lot of the people that they're 
attacking,

1753
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:49,620
they're attacking them for drug laws 
that shouldn't exist anyway.

1754
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:51,390
And so that's,
that's uh,

1755
01:24:51,391 --> 01:24:52,950
if we,
if we get a lot of it,

1756
01:24:52,951 --> 01:24:54,030
but there's a lot of other shit.

1757
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:57,060
But if we could get that,
if we can get rid of the drug,

1758
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:58,950
if we can get rid of the prohibition on 
drugs,

1759
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:01,260
however we do it,
I don't care.

1760
01:25:01,261 --> 01:25:04,800
But if we can get rid of the prohibition
on drugs so that now cops are just,

1761
01:25:04,801 --> 01:25:08,850
as Graham Hancock points out,
there's already laws in place for people

1762
01:25:08,851 --> 01:25:13,851
doing awful things under the influence 
of drugs or not under the influence of 

1763
01:25:13,851 --> 01:25:16,200
drugs.
We just need to enforce those.

1764
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:18,240
Not the drug laws themselves.
Right?

1765
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:21,330
So if,
if we remove that from the equation.

1766
01:25:21,331 --> 01:25:26,331
So these poor cops aren't being told to 
go out into the world and instead of 

1767
01:25:27,061 --> 01:25:29,310
being heroes,
you've also got a pole,

1768
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:34,640
relatively benign white powder out of 
the pockets of people who have $15 in 

1769
01:25:34,891 --> 01:25:39,891
the bank and only one experience,
a temporary moment of bliss before they 

1770
01:25:39,891 --> 01:25:44,181
pass out.
If you remove that component of their 

1771
01:25:44,181 --> 01:25:47,781
job and just like stop people from 
beating and killing each other and from 

1772
01:25:47,781 --> 01:25:52,521
stealing.
Don't worry about the drugs that now 

1773
01:25:52,521 --> 01:25:54,240
we've got heroes.
Now we've got night's riding through the

1774
01:25:54,241 --> 01:25:59,241
land who are actually doing everything 
they can to make people be cool instead 

1775
01:25:59,761 --> 01:26:04,460
of nights riding through the land.
We want to pull plant matter

1776
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:09,290
out of a 16 year olds pocket and act 
like the kid just assassinated Kennedy.

1777
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:11,590
That's not what we need.
And I think that's the.

1778
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:16,620
Once you.
Once you fucking fix the prohibition on 

1779
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:16,620
drugs,
man,

1780
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:20,171
then I think police officers are going 
to experience the same kind of respect 

1781
01:26:20,171 --> 01:26:21,530
that firemen get.
That's how it should be.

1782
01:26:21,531 --> 01:26:24,260
And one step further,
once they legalized marijuana,

1783
01:26:24,261 --> 01:26:29,261
everyone's going to start smoking pot 
and you're going to get a lot more 

1784
01:26:29,261 --> 01:26:29,261
relaxed.
People,

1785
01:26:29,261 --> 01:26:32,651
yes,
you're going to get people that are a 

1786
01:26:32,651 --> 01:26:32,651
lot more introspective.
Oh,

1787
01:26:32,651 --> 01:26:34,280
what are you saying?
This is what I'm saying.

1788
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:39,310
If you don't believe that a lot more 
people smoking pot would have a 

1789
01:26:39,310 --> 01:26:41,540
significant impact on the way human 
beings interact with each other.

1790
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:44,030
All that means to me is you don't smoke 
pot,

1791
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,400
right?
Because if you smoke pot,

1792
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:48,170
you would know that that's exactly what 
would happen.

1793
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:50,840
People would become more empathetic.
Not across the board.

1794
01:26:50,841 --> 01:26:51,890
Not always.
There's.

1795
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,920
There's always gonna be people that are.
The exception to the rule is always 

1796
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:56,920
going to be people that just don't get 
it yet.

1797
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:57,680
There's always going to be people that 
get it and they don't need.

1798
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,920
They don't need anything.
They just tuned in and they're kind and 

1799
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:03,290
they're on point and they're living in 
the moment and all that good shit,

1800
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:08,560
but then there's other people that 
benefit from those things and you deny 

1801
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,471
those people the opportunity to benefit 
from those things and then you become 

1802
01:27:11,471 --> 01:27:11,471
the enemy.
You become the Fuzz,

1803
01:27:11,471 --> 01:27:15,980
you become the man and then you're a 
fucking glorified revenue collector too.

1804
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,300
What are you really doing?
You're going to get,

1805
01:27:17,301 --> 01:27:20,900
I'm going to get a fine.
I got to go to court and pay the court.

1806
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,150
Fine.
What am I paying?

1807
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:28,150
I'm giving you money.
You need thousands of dollars because I 

1808
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:28,150
like plants.
How about fuck you?

1809
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:33,370
What kind of crazy shit is this?
You can lock me in a cage and charge me 

1810
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:36,230
money because I like plants or you're 
the arbiter of nature.

1811
01:27:36,231 --> 01:27:41,231
You're the one who gets to decide what's
beneficial and what's not with zero 

1812
01:27:41,231 --> 01:27:43,690
evidence behind it whatsoever,
which was one.

1813
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,770
It's one of the most heinous crimes on 
nature.

1814
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:50,950
The illegalization of marijuana is one 
of the most heinous crimes on nature 

1815
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:53,630
that mankind has ever,
ever put forth.

1816
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:58,720
And we're doing it to ourselves.
It's even worse than most of the shit 

1817
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,030
that we do to other planets or to other,
uh,

1818
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:06,040
other animals by torturing them or by 
killing them or by poisoning the lakes 

1819
01:28:07,641 --> 01:28:08,970
and the rivers.
And W,

1820
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:13,980
we're pleasing the consciousness of 
ourselves by not allowing people to have

1821
01:28:14,571 --> 01:28:18,350
freedom to experiment with all sorts of 
different states of consciousness.

1822
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:22,160
You have illegal way to do it through 
yoga.

1823
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:25,460
You have a legal way to do it through 
prescription medication.

1824
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:29,120
You have a legal way to do it through 
alcohol and things that we tax,

1825
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:34,510
but if you decide that you want to try 
to do it in a way that we haven't 

1826
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:36,620
sanctioned and we don't get paid for,
we don't get taxes from,

1827
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:40,870
we'll lock you in a fucking cage for the
rest of your life.

1828
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:42,530
That's right.
For the.

1829
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:48,080
The differences as far as impact,
like the physical danger significantly 

1830
01:28:48,171 --> 01:28:49,730
less than any of the ones that you have 
league.

1831
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,760
Oh yeah.
I get is the one that you can't die 

1832
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:54,760
from.
You can die from aspirin.

1833
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,990
There's not a single fucking person that
wants you to ban aspirin.

1834
01:28:56,991 --> 01:29:01,991
There's no band aspirin movement.
There's no like we've got to take these 

1835
01:29:01,991 --> 01:29:02,250
aspirin or you just eat a of aspirin.
You're fucked.

1836
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,480
Ban.
You're dead.

1837
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:04,410
Right.
If you.

1838
01:29:04,411 --> 01:29:07,380
If you have one of those bare fucking 
aspirins was bigger,

1839
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:09,510
I'd guarantee if you chug that whole 
bottle down,

1840
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:14,511
you'd or pure caffeine.
Don't forget that a kids die all the 

1841
01:29:14,511 --> 01:29:15,180
time from ordering pure caffeine from 
Amazon.

1842
01:29:15,181 --> 01:29:17,430
I don't know if they still sell it,
but they used to sell pure caffeine.

1843
01:29:17,431 --> 01:29:22,431
You hear it all the time,
kid like party takes a teaspoonful of 

1844
01:29:22,431 --> 01:29:24,000
pure caffeine and that's it,
man.

1845
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:25,610
Dead dead meat.
You know,

1846
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:27,810
your heart just flies right out of your 
fucking chest.

1847
01:29:27,811 --> 01:29:29,070
Like a bird.
Yeah,

1848
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:31,890
that's right man.
And how about just water?

1849
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:36,950
I mean there was that woman on a radio 
station in Sacramento or something a 

1850
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:37,530
year,
a few years back.

1851
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:41,790
She was involved in some sort of contest
to see who could drink the most water.

1852
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,090
And if you drank the most water,
you know,

1853
01:29:44,091 --> 01:29:45,450
you got a prize hair member.

1854
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,910
She fucking died.
That's terrible.

1855
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:50,530
She went home to her.
I mean she,

1856
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:55,540
she was,
she was on her way home or something 

1857
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:55,540
like that.
She had a,

1858
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:57,890
she had a daughter.
She was just trying to make some extra 

1859
01:29:57,890 --> 01:29:57,890
money.
Yeah.

1860
01:29:57,890 --> 01:29:58,890
When she died drinking water.
And it's insane.

1861
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,960
It's insane.
But that wouldn't happen to you if you 

1862
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:03,960
smoke too much pot.
That's right.

1863
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:04,410
Wouldn't happen to know if he ate too 
much pot.

1864
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:06,840
Right.
So the idea that they're locking anybody

1865
01:30:06,841 --> 01:30:10,440
up for that is fucking ridiculous.
If you put cops in a position where they

1866
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:14,790
have to enforce a law that they know,
everybody knows is ridiculous,

1867
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:18,690
then that cop is in a bad position in 
society.

1868
01:30:18,691 --> 01:30:23,340
He becomes the enemy from the jump,
the enemy that he can't even agree with.

1869
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:26,760
Most cops you talked to most cops,
they don't give a fuck about pot.

1870
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,330
They don't want to have to enforce that.
Most guys in their thirties,

1871
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:32,910
you'd have to be a total complete piece 
of shit.

1872
01:30:32,911 --> 01:30:37,911
Yeah.
As a human being to be a cop and your 

1873
01:30:37,911 --> 01:30:38,580
thirties and really want to arrest a 
regular person that's not doing anything

1874
01:30:38,581 --> 01:30:39,900
wrong.
Who happens to have a joint on them?

1875
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:44,760
You got to be a piece of shit.
If this guy didn't do anything wrong and

1876
01:30:44,761 --> 01:30:46,380
he has a joint on them and you want to 
arrest him,

1877
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:51,240
you're a cunt.
Yet of beyond all the scripture.

1878
01:30:51,241 --> 01:30:52,270
Adult.
Yeah.

1879
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,590
I mean that's.
That's a problem because that is the law

1880
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:57,960
in most states.
That is the law,

1881
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:01,920
like they're supposed to arrest you for 
that most states most,

1882
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,450
yeah.
Which is insane.

1883
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,500
We,
here we are,

1884
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:09,760
we,
we were sending videos with the sky 

1885
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:09,760
phone to phone.
We're,

1886
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:13,710
we're periscoping and livestreaming and 
driving around in cars that have 

1887
01:31:13,921 --> 01:31:15,600
satellites connected to them.

1888
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,350
They tell you exactly what street you're
on and how when the turns coming up,

1889
01:31:19,351 --> 01:31:23,790
they give you a ding Dong to tell you to
turn exactly where you are.

1890
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:26,090
And yet we still have that.
Yeah.

1891
01:31:26,091 --> 01:31:28,380
But it's changing.
It is changing and it's,

1892
01:31:28,381 --> 01:31:31,590
it just doesn't happen as fast as,
as stones would like it to change.

1893
01:31:31,591 --> 01:31:36,591
Like it seems so obvious.
You want the thing to flip around 

1894
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:39,141
instantly.
It's almost like they can't do that 

1895
01:31:39,141 --> 01:31:39,160
because then they would have to admit 
fault or it's it.

1896
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:44,190
It's almost like there's just a terrible
bureaucratic web that uh,

1897
01:31:45,690 --> 01:31:50,690
it takes time to make things change.
When you're using that bureaucratic web.

1898
01:31:51,121 --> 01:31:52,590
That's the fucking problem,
man.

1899
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:56,790
And things are slow but shit there,
it's happening.

1900
01:31:56,850 --> 01:31:58,770
It is happening.
It's going to become legal.

1901
01:31:58,771 --> 01:31:59,890
We can't stop there.

1902
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:04,440
We've got to get psilocybin a 
prescribed,

1903
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:09,540
at the very least.
MTMA needs to be a prescription 

1904
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:12,571
medication.
All psychoactive substances like Iowasca

1905
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,300
DMT.
All of these things need to be studied,

1906
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:21,360
they need to be researched and then they
need to get into the hands of doctors 

1907
01:32:21,401 --> 01:32:24,190
who could really use them to help 
people.

1908
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:29,910
It could be an incredible tool for 
helping people who are suffering right 

1909
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:32,530
now and the whole thing's all gummed up 
and that is a true tragedy.

1910
01:32:32,531 --> 01:32:36,100
It doesn't stop with marijuana though.
It goes all the way through the spectrum

1911
01:32:36,101 --> 01:32:39,700
of drugs and it also goes to the very 
creepy,

1912
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:45,920
unacknowledged a problem with the 
pharmaceutical companies which are 

1913
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:52,560
releasing heroin on a daily basis into 
the bloodstream of this species and 

1914
01:32:53,201 --> 01:32:55,240
they're not being treated like heroin 
dealers.

1915
01:32:55,241 --> 01:33:00,241
A lot of people are getting addicted to 
super powerful pharmaceutical 

1916
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:04,860
medications and I don't think the 
pharmaceutical companies are being held 

1917
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:08,440
to any kind of tea to anything.
It's just for whatever reason,

1918
01:33:08,441 --> 01:33:13,441
if I.
If your friend gets addicted to oxy 

1919
01:33:13,441 --> 01:33:15,700
cotton because his back was thrown out 
and you hear that story,

1920
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:18,670
you're supposed to feel a little bit 
more empathy towards them.

1921
01:33:18,671 --> 01:33:23,671
Then if you hear somebody,
you got addicted to black tar heroin 

1922
01:33:23,671 --> 01:33:23,671
when it's like,
no,

1923
01:33:23,671 --> 01:33:24,220
it's the same fucking thing.

1924
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:29,240
Thing like wasn't that part of the 
argument with the Silk Road trial was 

1925
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:32,261
that this young man who had run that 
website that allowed people to buy all 

1926
01:33:32,261 --> 01:33:36,941
sorts of illegal drugs,
he had been directly responsible for 

1927
01:33:36,941 --> 01:33:40,571
people overdosing.
He'd been directly responsible for 

1928
01:33:40,571 --> 01:33:43,691
people that may have committed some 
crimes and done some shitty things were 

1929
01:33:43,691 --> 01:33:47,480
on those drugs and you know,
he had to face the parents of people who

1930
01:33:47,481 --> 01:33:52,481
bought drugs and overdosed in some form.
I don't know the specifics of the case,

1931
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:55,660
but that was part of what they were 
charging them for.

1932
01:33:55,870 --> 01:33:57,190
Well,
how come that never gets brought up with

1933
01:33:57,210 --> 01:34:02,210
pharmaceutical companies?
Because I mean think about all the 

1934
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:04,481
different people you're not,
so you're not responsible for your own 

1935
01:34:04,481 --> 01:34:04,890
actions as long as the drugs illegal.
Right?

1936
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:09,910
But you are responsible for your own 
actions if the drugs legal and 

1937
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:11,300
prescribed by a doctor,
but maybe even more addictive.

1938
01:34:11,301 --> 01:34:12,200
Like,
wait a minute,

1939
01:34:12,201 --> 01:34:17,201
what the fuck?
Kinda stupid rules are we abiding by 

1940
01:34:17,201 --> 01:34:17,201
here?
Take Heath Ledger.

1941
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:19,860
Take him,
if he take you to that,

1942
01:34:19,870 --> 01:34:21,380
check them in your eyes.
Take him,

1943
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:26,620
take him.
Take Heath Ledger and imagine if heath 

1944
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:27,340
ledger had oded on heroin.
Remember when God,

1945
01:34:27,341 --> 01:34:28,070
what?
Phoenix.

1946
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:29,540
Phoenix.
Now River Phoenix,

1947
01:34:29,541 --> 01:34:31,450
the great actor.
He sell coal blind.

1948
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:32,560
Seymour Hoffman,
right?

1949
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:32,560
Right.

1950
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:35,440
One of the news stories is how they're 
trying to find his dealer.

1951
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:36,010
Right?
They're like,

1952
01:34:36,011 --> 01:34:38,350
we're going to hunt down the guy who 
sold in this fucking shitty smack,

1953
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:40,510
but when he fletcher,
Oh,

1954
01:34:40,511 --> 01:34:43,570
d's on these fucking pills.
You don't hear anybody being like,

1955
01:34:43,571 --> 01:34:48,571
we're going to find the pharmacists that
gave heath ledger this combination of 

1956
01:34:48,571 --> 01:34:49,600
fucking pills and we're going to take 
this son of a bitch down.

1957
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:50,260
It's just like,
wow.

1958
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:55,280
It was pills.
So it's heath ledger's thought that's 

1959
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,350
not the pharmacist,
but.

1960
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:57,590
So does.
Very good point.

1961
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,910
Yeah.
It's just very,

1962
01:34:58,911 --> 01:35:00,370
very good to take you.
It's like,

1963
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:03,980
let's acknowledge the fact that if you 
are dealing drugs,

1964
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:07,820
you're a drug dealer and whatever the 
drug is that you're dealing,

1965
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:13,170
uh,
whether it's sanctioned by the state or 

1966
01:35:13,170 --> 01:35:13,370
not sanctioned by the state,
whatever that drug is,

1967
01:35:13,371 --> 01:35:13,790
that you're,
uh,

1968
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:14,850
dealing,
uh,

1969
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:19,010
it is the decision of the person who 
buys it from you to take it.

1970
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:22,280
It is their own freewill.
It is human autonomy.

1971
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:26,450
If you decide to take a substance that 
is your right as a human,

1972
01:35:26,451 --> 01:35:30,200
no matter what the fuck it is from God 
damn heroin to marijuana,

1973
01:35:30,201 --> 01:35:35,201
to alcohol,
your right as a human being on this 

1974
01:35:35,201 --> 01:35:35,390
planet is to,
as much as you want,

1975
01:35:35,391 --> 01:35:40,391
alter or transform your particular 
chemical states or psychological states 

1976
01:35:40,551 --> 01:35:45,530
or mood states even if it ends up 
killing you,

1977
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:49,280
but your but,
but under the effects of those things,

1978
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:52,520
you're not allowed to hurt other people.
You're not allowed to do fucked up shit.

1979
01:35:52,521 --> 01:35:57,521
And if you do,
those are the laws and the crimes that 

1980
01:35:57,521 --> 01:35:57,521
you should be.
How the candidates,

1981
01:35:57,521 --> 01:36:01,000
oh,
for Hunter Thompson had a set of rules 

1982
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,220
that he was trying to establish when he 
was running for mayor of Aspen in the 19

1983
01:36:04,221 --> 01:36:07,460
seventies and one of the things was he 
was going to have stock hades.

1984
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:10,790
He was gonna.
He was gonna sign up to all the streets,

1985
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:12,500
like chew up all the concrete,
saw the streets,

1986
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:17,680
and he was going to have stock that he 
would put drug dealers so that he said 

1987
01:36:17,991 --> 01:36:22,991
that any drug worth taking you should 
never buy or sell of rule four rule is 

1988
01:36:26,361 --> 01:36:31,361
what we going to.
What he was going to do was he was 

1989
01:36:31,361 --> 01:36:31,590
gonna.
Well obviously it wasn't really going to

1990
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,840
do that.
I mean it was pros,

1991
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:37,990
but he was saying that he was going to 
have stock hades in front of the 

1992
01:36:37,990 --> 01:36:39,260
statehouse where he would,
or front of the building,

1993
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:40,940
whatever it would be.
Wow.

1994
01:36:41,890 --> 01:36:43,340
He's great man.
Great.

1995
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,950
What is his.
He's got another quote.

1996
01:36:44,951 --> 01:36:46,330
I just read what I just,
I love.

1997
01:36:46,331 --> 01:36:48,520
Which is like,
you don't find lsd.

1998
01:36:48,521 --> 01:36:51,280
LSD finds you when you're ready.
It's true.

1999
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:52,140
It's pretty cool,

2000
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:53,330
man.
I don't believe that.

2001
01:36:53,331 --> 01:36:55,700
I believe that with all psychedelics.
I really do.

2002
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:58,700
It sounds so stupid when you say it.
Like you believe it,

2003
01:36:58,710 --> 01:37:03,710
bro.
You believe it was a plan for 

2004
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:05,711
everything.
It doesn't matter if I believe or don't 

2005
01:37:05,711 --> 01:37:05,711
believe because I really would never 
know if it's true,

2006
01:37:05,711 --> 01:37:07,910
but it's fun to believe it,
so therefore I believe it.

2007
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:13,210
I don't really think that the Hulk Bruce
Banner becomes the hulk and leaps 

2008
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:13,700
through the air and smashes the 
airplanes,

2009
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:18,910
but it's fun.
It's fun to watch it and while it's 

2010
01:37:18,910 --> 01:37:18,910
happening I try to pretend like it's 
really happened,

2011
01:37:19,190 --> 01:37:19,610
man.

2012
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:22,330
Damn right.
That's a problematic.

2013
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:27,350
You know,
I think a lot of skeptics and cynics 

2014
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:30,151
does sound on fun.
They don't understand that it's that 

2015
01:37:30,151 --> 01:37:32,730
like they were.
I believe that I can choose whatever 

2016
01:37:32,730 --> 01:37:33,970
lens I want to use to look through the 
universe.

2017
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:39,010
They're super important to men because 
they dispelled bullshit and then the 

2018
01:37:39,010 --> 01:37:42,620
comforter,
the comfort that you have in balancing 

2019
01:37:42,620 --> 01:37:42,830
on the ledge of truth and fantasy and 
fun,

2020
01:37:43,110 --> 01:37:46,580
and some people do not have that comfort
on that ledge and for them,

2021
01:37:46,581 --> 01:37:50,870
skeptics are hugely important because 
they can disprove a lot of the shit that

2022
01:37:50,871 --> 01:37:55,871
other folks can't see.
Everybody has different vision when it 

2023
01:37:55,871 --> 01:37:56,400
comes to their ability to perceive 
things and some are born shortsighted,

2024
01:37:56,610 --> 01:38:01,610
but we're supposed to pretend that the 
brain is 100 percent equal across the 

2025
01:38:01,610 --> 01:38:03,480
board and everyone can see all the 
bullshit that everyone else can see.

2026
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,100
Well,
that's not always the case.

2027
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:10,340
There's some people that just don't have
good sight and they don't have good 

2028
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:12,570
clarity there.
They just don't and they need help.

2029
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:13,830
Well,
yeah,

2030
01:38:13,831 --> 01:38:15,210
they do.
You're right,

2031
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:17,550
but those people aren't gonna.
Listen to a fucking skeptic.

2032
01:38:17,551 --> 01:38:19,560
I mean data.
If they need a little,

2033
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:21,520
some of them will.
There's,

2034
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:23,760
there's a spectrum of them,
but,

2035
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:26,430
but I do think you are as a skeptic in 
the same way,

2036
01:38:26,431 --> 01:38:31,431
like I will fully admit that many 
fantasies that I have many ideas that I 

2037
01:38:31,431 --> 01:38:36,351
have a completely unprovable and more 
than likely horse shit,

2038
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:40,380
but they're so fun.
They're so fun.

2039
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:43,980
But here's another thing that's 
important to acknowledge is that some of

2040
01:38:43,981 --> 01:38:46,260
the lenses that you look through the 
universe through,

2041
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:51,480
even if the symbols that are within 
those lenses are completely ridiculous,

2042
01:38:51,481 --> 01:38:54,600
like the symbol of Jesus rising from the
dead,

2043
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:58,800
for example,
or the symbol of a ganache or the symbol

2044
01:38:58,801 --> 01:38:59,520
of Honamin.

2045
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:04,850
Uh,
even though the symbols themselves are 

2046
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:07,850
clearly a fantasy,
the effect of gazing through those 

2047
01:39:07,850 --> 01:39:12,681
lenses and the effect that it has on the
decisions that you make quite often can 

2048
01:39:12,681 --> 01:39:15,660
be really profound.
Which is that instead of making selfish,

2049
01:39:15,661 --> 01:39:17,430
stupid,
angry decisions,

2050
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:22,640
you might start making more positive 
decisions because you've connected with 

2051
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:26,511
this architect,
archetypical God of friendship and 

2052
01:39:26,511 --> 01:39:27,020
devotion,
which is who Honamin as you know,

2053
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:32,120
Hanuman's.
This monkey God that represents like 

2054
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:35,010
pure devotion or service and friendship 
at the deepest,

2055
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:38,100
sweetest level to.
And it's beautiful,

2056
01:39:38,101 --> 01:39:43,101
it's beautiful,
and so I can use that symbol if I want 

2057
01:39:43,101 --> 01:39:43,101
to,
uh,

2058
01:39:43,101 --> 01:39:46,730
when I'm thinking about loyalty or when 
I'm thinking about like giving up my 

2059
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:52,680
life for another person's life.
When I think about like giving myself to

2060
01:39:52,681 --> 01:39:57,681
another person with nothing really to 
gain other than giving myself to that 

2061
01:39:57,681 --> 01:39:58,050
person and helping them as I can.

2062
01:39:58,170 --> 01:39:59,760
It's a great symbol.
It works.

2063
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:02,310
Doesn't have to be fucking real.
Do I believe in a monkey?

2064
01:40:02,311 --> 01:40:05,610
God that flies through the sky?
Do I believe in that?

2065
01:40:05,850 --> 01:40:07,770
Do you think that symbols would,
they can be,

2066
01:40:07,830 --> 01:40:12,830
is almost like dedicated,
dedicated thoughts that you can cling 

2067
01:40:13,471 --> 01:40:18,471
onto if you're trying to explain this,
if you're moving through a sea of being 

2068
01:40:21,421 --> 01:40:23,010
a person,
all the variables,

2069
01:40:23,011 --> 01:40:26,470
all the negatives and positives and the,
the,

2070
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:26,770
the,
the,

2071
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:31,771
the changing of the tide,
of your emotions and your happiness and 

2072
01:40:31,771 --> 01:40:31,771
your discontent and your depression 
will.

2073
01:40:31,771 --> 01:40:36,090
But you could have these islands that in
this float you could cling to and one of

2074
01:40:36,091 --> 01:40:37,670
them might be the Buddha.
Yes.

2075
01:40:37,671 --> 01:40:39,990
And when you see the Buddha,
you think of enlightenment.

2076
01:40:39,991 --> 01:40:44,991
You think of yourself at peace and they 
can somehow or another imbibe you imbibe

2077
01:40:45,411 --> 01:40:47,310
view with this,
this,

2078
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:52,110
this cap encapsulization of like you're 
like,

2079
01:40:52,111 --> 01:40:54,190
you're at least your imaginary

2080
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:56,500
idea of what it's like to be 
enlightened.

2081
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:57,640
Damn right,
you clean,

2082
01:40:57,670 --> 01:41:00,100
you clean to that and that I can maybe 
guide you a little.

2083
01:41:00,101 --> 01:41:05,101
You could hold onto that and it'll carry
you down and maybe from there you can 

2084
01:41:05,101 --> 01:41:08,641
get to dry land.
Maybe from there you can get to the 

2085
01:41:08,641 --> 01:41:08,641
island of new ideas,
but these,

2086
01:41:08,641 --> 01:41:10,890
these archetypal things that you claim 
to these,

2087
01:41:10,891 --> 01:41:13,030
these images,
whatever they may be,

2088
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:18,060
the reason why they've existed 
throughout history as that people have 

2089
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:20,641
found value in their memories and 
connecting thoughts and principles and 

2090
01:41:20,641 --> 01:41:23,140
ideas to these symbols and that's why 
they defend them so hard.

2091
01:41:23,141 --> 01:41:25,030
That's why people want to kill you.
If you draw Muhammad,

2092
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,270
if you fuck up their idea of their 
symbol,

2093
01:41:27,530 --> 01:41:30,910
their symbol is so significant to them 
that they're willing to.

2094
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:36,220
If they're willing to lash out and 
caused murder because you violated 

2095
01:41:36,530 --> 01:41:36,670
their.

2096
01:41:36,990 --> 01:41:39,120
They got stuck on the assemble and 
that's the.

2097
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:44,250
That's a problem.
It's like somebody going through the 

2098
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,630
wilderness thinking that the campus is 
the destination and it's,

2099
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:46,440
you know,
that's.

2100
01:41:46,470 --> 01:41:49,800
I don't know how anyone would be that 
dumb to think that and so that's a wrong

2101
01:41:49,801 --> 01:41:51,720
way to put it,
but it's a really.

2102
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:56,770
It's a in the same way literally like 
people who are always fighting over the 

2103
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:59,130
literal g or the historic Jesus,
you know,

2104
01:41:59,131 --> 01:42:01,500
the people are like,
that guy didn't even fucking exist,

2105
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:04,170
and that people that get really caught 
up and disproving Jesus,

2106
01:42:04,410 --> 01:42:09,410
they've also gotten caught up in the 
surface level of that symbol and so 

2107
01:42:09,410 --> 01:42:10,580
they're spending all their time trying 
to prove no,

2108
01:42:10,581 --> 01:42:10,950
no,
no.

2109
01:42:10,951 --> 01:42:15,951
There's never was a historic Jesus or 
the historic Jesus that existed was not 

2110
01:42:15,951 --> 01:42:18,870
the Jesus in the Bible that has blah,
whatever you want to say.

2111
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:20,780
You're damn right you,
I,

2112
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:23,580
I'll buy a shirt.
There was no real Jesus or there was.

2113
01:42:23,581 --> 01:42:28,581
He was one of many people or who knows,
or maybe he wasn't magical or whatever 

2114
01:42:28,581 --> 01:42:30,300
on one level,
fuck yes,

2115
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:33,150
you're 100 percent right.
There's also no Santa Claus.

2116
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:37,590
There's no such thing as ghosts.
There's no such thing as reincarnation,

2117
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:42,860
we're all just a non-differentiated 
aspect of a great mass of Adam's 

2118
01:42:44,311 --> 01:42:49,311
currently being exploded out of an event
13 point 8 billion years ago,

2119
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:51,960
and that's it.
Nothing else.

2120
01:42:51,961 --> 01:42:55,110
That's fucking it.
That's one level and it's totally real.

2121
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,870
There's another level though.
That's the problem.

2122
01:42:57,871 --> 01:43:02,520
There is a completely other level which 
is that the level of the interior self,

2123
01:43:02,521 --> 01:43:05,760
the level of the subjective,
the universe did a big bang.

2124
01:43:05,761 --> 01:43:08,700
It exploded from the.
It did a big bang.

2125
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:13,790
It exploded.
I did a big duty like God is a baby,

2126
01:43:14,881 --> 01:43:19,881
just accidentally shit Outta universe,
but it explodes out and then it ends up 

2127
01:43:19,881 --> 01:43:24,561
turning into human beings and human 
beings end up somehow developing this 

2128
01:43:24,561 --> 01:43:27,530
incredibly advanced for frontal lobe and
the neo cortex.

2129
01:43:28,110 --> 01:43:29,650
Whenever you can throw out that word,
throw it out,

2130
01:43:29,651 --> 01:43:34,651
it makes you seem smart.
Couldn't have a neocortex walked out to 

2131
01:43:34,651 --> 01:43:34,651
me.
I wouldn't know what it looked like,

2132
01:43:34,651 --> 01:43:35,460
but.
But when that happened,

2133
01:43:35,461 --> 01:43:37,530
we.
We gained an interior universe,

2134
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:39,930
which is the universe of symbols,
myth,

2135
01:43:39,990 --> 01:43:41,730
dreams,
stories,

2136
01:43:41,850 --> 01:43:45,180
and that's a real part of the material 
universe.

2137
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:50,300
The material universe has a substrata,
which is the universe of myth and the 

2138
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:52,490
universe of religion and the universe of
fantasy,

2139
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:54,620
and that's another level of the fucking 
thing,

2140
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,020
and if you start tuning into those 
symbols,

2141
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:00,740
it doesn't matter if you're tuning into 
an externalized,

2142
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:05,770
mystical,
super entity or whether you're tuning 

2143
01:44:05,770 --> 01:44:09,131
into a part of your brain that it comes 
from millions of years of evolution.

2144
01:44:09,801 --> 01:44:14,720
You're still tuning into a point where 
from a harmonizing with it,

2145
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:19,340
you can experience an elevated mood 
state and that elevated mood,

2146
01:44:19,341 --> 01:44:21,800
state and whatever way it manifests from
the,

2147
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:27,160
uh,
experience of Samadhi to the experience 

2148
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:30,041
of the passion of the Christ,
the surrender to allowing yourself to be

2149
01:44:31,341 --> 01:44:33,830
destroyed by time and still loving it.

2150
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:38,860
Or a yoga class or a comedy club or 
being the see a concert.

2151
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:44,320
Yeah,
be you see a concert and you seeing 

2152
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,001
someone perform music or someone was 
really good that you really appreciate 

2153
01:44:46,001 --> 01:44:46,730
their art.
It moves you,

2154
01:44:46,731 --> 01:44:48,440
you're holding,
your body feels different,

2155
01:44:48,441 --> 01:44:50,880
your emotions get torn up.
You're like,

2156
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:55,900
wow.
Like people will cry when they hear a 

2157
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:55,900
great song though.
There'll be moved like the like,

2158
01:44:55,900 --> 01:45:00,400
fuck yeah,
they'll throw their hands in the air to 

2159
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:00,400
get nutty.
The body will start moving,

2160
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:04,601
the Kinnaman help it or a mantra or a 
mantra or a mantra or or or any number 

2161
01:45:04,701 --> 01:45:09,701
of things that you can lock into with or
sounds or images or some thing that we 

2162
01:45:09,831 --> 01:45:14,540
have encapsulated that causes us to 
react in this incredible way that we can

2163
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:19,541
replicate shot through the shoe,
gave him a bad name and everybody just 

2164
01:45:24,021 --> 01:45:27,500
goes fucking crazy whether or not you 
agree with Bon Jovi or not.

2165
01:45:27,950 --> 01:45:31,820
That moment where 15,000
freaks go crazy.

2166
01:45:31,821 --> 01:45:33,380
Yeah,
because he sinks,

2167
01:45:33,381 --> 01:45:37,100
shot through the heart and you're to 
blame and they just lose their shit.

2168
01:45:37,101 --> 01:45:40,460
They can't help but they're stomping.
They're hugging each other like,

2169
01:45:40,461 --> 01:45:42,110
oh my God,
they're high fiving each other.

2170
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:47,320
It's the best.
Like it's undeniable that that gave 

2171
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:47,320
those 15,000
people,

2172
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:51,190
you know,
step out of the role of being an art 

2173
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:52,310
critic for a moment and look at what 
happened to those 15,000

2174
01:45:52,311 --> 01:45:53,270
people.
It's like,

2175
01:45:53,271 --> 01:45:54,830
that's how I have to do with the 
grateful dead.

2176
01:45:55,130 --> 01:46:00,130
I've,
I've always had to step outside of the 

2177
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:00,130
role of a music critic and just 
appreciate the.

2178
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:02,300
Some people love the fuck out of them.
Like,

2179
01:46:02,301 --> 01:46:04,090
okay,
I'm missing a gene or something.

2180
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:06,200
No,
you've never taken acid and listening to

2181
01:46:06,201 --> 01:46:10,550
the grateful dead.
You gotta do man,

2182
01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:12,770
take some acid and listening to the 
grateful dead with me.

2183
01:46:12,771 --> 01:46:17,771
You'll understand dude.
I smoked DMT and listened to eco rose 

2184
01:46:17,771 --> 01:46:17,930
with Aubrey.
Wow.

2185
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:23,170
And that.
I don't know if the grateful dead and 

2186
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:25,310
acid is going to be able to fuck with 
eco rose and the DMT experience.

2187
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:27,080
You have to do that.
By the way.

2188
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:29,600
I would like to try.
That is very different.

2189
01:46:29,601 --> 01:46:32,200
The ECO rose thing is very different.
This is what

2190
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:36,860
mechanic was saying that these Shamans,
they sing for things into form.

2191
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:40,160
They did.
You see like a visual representation.

2192
01:46:40,290 --> 01:46:43,590
It's perfectly sinked.
They're one in the same.

2193
01:46:43,591 --> 01:46:47,430
There are two different things that go 
together and buy their own on their own.

2194
01:46:47,431 --> 01:46:49,350
They're are magical.
I mean on own.

2195
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:50,040
Did the ECO

2196
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:55,050
sound fucking amazing?
I listened to them on my way home from 

2197
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:56,040
gigs when I want to see what I want to 
think about things,

2198
01:46:56,041 --> 01:47:01,041
but I also want to hear something 
because I don't know what the fuck 

2199
01:47:01,041 --> 01:47:01,041
they're saying so because I don't know 
what they're saying.

2200
01:47:01,041 --> 01:47:03,630
I can enjoy it without being attached to
the words.

2201
01:47:03,631 --> 01:47:05,040
They're just a bunch of noises.
To me,

2202
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:10,041
the cool noises and I know guys and only
because I know that word Iowasca I have.

2203
01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:13,870
I've got a guy.
It's really we.

2204
01:47:13,871 --> 01:47:15,540
It sounds like a little kid singing 
kind.

2205
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:19,200
It doesn't act like a little kid and the
forest would just be singing that song.

2206
01:47:19,230 --> 01:47:20,610
There's a lot of them that are like 
that.

2207
01:47:20,611 --> 01:47:25,611
Yeah.
There's a lot of them that are really 

2208
01:47:25,611 --> 01:47:25,611
interesting.
What is that?

2209
01:47:25,611 --> 01:47:26,020
Is that blowing the smoke?

2210
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:26,440
Yeah.

2211
01:47:30,410 --> 01:47:33,290
I listen to this one.
I whistle this one.

2212
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:36,410
I find myself like whistling it through 
the day and the other day

2213
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:42,750
I was whistling at the comedy store and 
one of the dudes who works there started

2214
01:47:42,751 --> 01:47:44,520
whistling on.
It was weird.

2215
01:47:44,970 --> 01:47:45,900
He knew it.
Nope.

2216
01:47:46,670 --> 01:47:47,550
Nope.
What?

2217
01:47:47,551 --> 01:47:49,870
I was doing it so much.
I was doing it so much,

2218
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:54,900
it sort of snuck into them,
so the idea behind it,

2219
01:47:54,901 --> 01:47:59,901
according to the Shaman is that the 
plants give them their salt and that as 

2220
01:48:01,351 --> 01:48:06,351
they're cooking up,
the IOWASCA did learn the song and they 

2221
01:48:06,351 --> 01:48:09,270
figured out through this relationship,
this pure relationship that they have to

2222
01:48:09,271 --> 01:48:14,150
the madre because they're a real sharp 
and over the,

2223
01:48:14,570 --> 01:48:16,860
you know,
thousands of years of them doing this.

2224
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:22,220
They found some songs and when you,
when you experienced dmt under the spell

2225
01:48:22,591 --> 01:48:27,591
of the songs is a very,
very strange experience because they,

2226
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:30,840
they belong together.
It's like when you're hearing this,

2227
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,210
every time it changes and there's a 
whistle,

2228
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:37,960
a new chapter,
we'll start a new geometric pattern will

2229
01:48:37,990 --> 01:48:40,950
explode into something completely 
different and dance around you

2230
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:45,890
and there's like a whole series that you
listened to when you're on a trip,

2231
01:48:46,220 --> 01:48:51,220
you start off with one sort of an 
introductory one and you move into the 

2232
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:54,251
other one.
And as it goes deeper and deeper and 

2233
01:48:54,251 --> 01:48:56,591
deeper that the experience changes and 
becomes this like really crazy complex 

2234
01:48:59,210 --> 01:49:02,440
geometrical life form that's all 
encompassing.

2235
01:49:02,441 --> 01:49:05,210
It's everything that's all around you.
That's beautiful.

2236
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:06,520
It's very strange,
dude.

2237
01:49:06,770 --> 01:49:08,690
That gets in the background.

2238
01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:12,150
That's legit as fuck,
man.

2239
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:17,520
This is all recorded during a ceremony,
so this is not just happening like with 

2240
01:49:19,401 --> 01:49:24,401
the guy singing happening,
there's a guy singing with a group of 

2241
01:49:24,401 --> 01:49:27,761
people tripping the fucking balls off 
and he's guiding them and while this is 

2242
01:49:32,251 --> 01:49:37,251
going on,
like it dances all around you and sues 

2243
01:49:37,251 --> 01:49:40,610
you and Tom to you and explained to you,
do you know what even trippier about 

2244
01:49:40,610 --> 01:49:40,890
this

2245
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:45,950
is that that night when you ever was 
lived near this shrimping,

2246
01:49:45,951 --> 01:49:47,150
they're fucking brains.

2247
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:49,630
I bet somebody thought,
man,

2248
01:49:49,631 --> 01:49:53,530
why do I feel like this is gonna get 
transmitted to 10 million people?

2249
01:49:54,610 --> 01:49:59,610
How weird is that?
How weird is it that that's a very 

2250
01:49:59,610 --> 01:49:59,620
strange thing.
That's what technology does because here

2251
01:49:59,621 --> 01:50:04,550
you consider this incredible night.
God knows where that was probably where.

2252
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:06,580
Where do you think that was recorded?
Who the fuck knows?

2253
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:09,130
Somewhere I'll have an experiment that I
want to do what?

2254
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:12,010
I'm going to have crash rig my tank up 
with speakers.

2255
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:15,490
I want to listen to that in the tank 
because I think if I listened to that in

2256
01:50:15,491 --> 01:50:20,491
a tank enough,
I think if I put that on loop for like 

2257
01:50:20,491 --> 01:50:21,250
an hour,
I think I could trip my balls off.

2258
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,230
I think I'm going to try that experiment
to.

2259
01:50:23,580 --> 01:50:25,450
Yeah.
Well you have a tank.

2260
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:28,190
No,
you fucking fucking tag now.

2261
01:50:28,191 --> 01:50:31,210
I got his intent now.
It's so cool.

2262
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:32,790
I'm A.
I'm a zen 10.

2263
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:35,560
Explained to me the situation.
It's in a bedroom.

2264
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:36,580
Well,
yeah.

2265
01:50:36,581 --> 01:50:39,340
What it is is because you know,
like a Cemati tanker,

2266
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:40,930
any of the crashes,
tanks,

2267
01:50:40,931 --> 01:50:44,700
they're fucking crazy giant things and 
take a while to sell.

2268
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:45,820
They're expensive.
Right?

2269
01:50:46,210 --> 01:50:51,210
So yeah,
this is just like a essentially like a 

2270
01:50:51,210 --> 01:50:52,390
reversed waterbed I guess you'd say.
It's like it's a,

2271
01:50:53,450 --> 01:50:55,030
it's a,
it's a tent.

2272
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:59,080
A that how many gallons of water.
I don't know the exact gallons,

2273
01:50:59,081 --> 01:51:04,081
but it's big enough to float and fine.
Like because I floated out in Austin at 

2274
01:51:04,081 --> 01:51:05,500
the Float Institute and the upload is 
amazing.

2275
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:10,560
Amazing.
The presses right up there with crashes 

2276
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:10,560
place and if you done crashes place.
I haven't done that yet.

2277
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,770
Crashes the grandmaster,
but this guy who's got the tank place in

2278
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:16,360
Austin.
Yeah,

2279
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:17,230
Kevin,
what's it called?

2280
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:22,440
Float Float Institute Institute.
He's got his things are built like 

2281
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:25,200
boats,
like the hub of a boat trailer.

2282
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,830
Yeah.
Those things are super durable.

2283
01:51:26,831 --> 01:51:31,831
They don't even know liner there.
They're fucking cool man are super high 

2284
01:51:31,831 --> 01:51:31,831
tech.
Super High Tech.

2285
01:51:31,831 --> 01:51:32,500
But the,
you know,

2286
01:51:32,501 --> 01:51:37,501
the essence of the thing is you've got a
shit ton of salt and water and you only 

2287
01:51:40,241 --> 01:51:42,040
need a certain amount of room,
you know,

2288
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:44,530
based on like the average size of a 
human being.

2289
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:46,600
Plenty of room in the damn things.
But yeah,

2290
01:51:46,601 --> 01:51:51,601
I just uh,
like I didn't realize how much I would 

2291
01:51:51,941 --> 01:51:55,530
enjoy having a float tank in my house.
Like it.

2292
01:51:55,600 --> 01:52:00,600
I had no idea that it would be that 
important to me.

2293
01:52:01,151 --> 01:52:03,370
I've only had it for a few days and 
weeks lived with me.

2294
01:52:03,371 --> 01:52:06,310
You use it all the time and I forget 
exactly.

2295
01:52:06,311 --> 01:52:07,900
But.
And it was awesome to have access,

2296
01:52:07,901 --> 01:52:10,390
but I was so brokenhearted and crazy 
back then.

2297
01:52:10,830 --> 01:52:13,300
Like now it's just like,
you know,

2298
01:52:13,301 --> 01:52:16,270
I've been working out,
I'll go workout at the gym,

2299
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:20,320
come back to the house with sore muscles
and then you're just,

2300
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:25,710
regardless of all the mystical shit,
you're floating in 650 pounds of epsom 

2301
01:52:25,710 --> 01:52:28,210
salt with sore muscles and that feels 
damn good.

2302
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:30,760
No,
it feels like you're charging batteries.

2303
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:34,390
It's really amazing.
And you walk out of the thing every time

2304
01:52:34,391 --> 01:52:39,391
so far,
and I've done 30 minute floats up to 

2305
01:52:39,391 --> 01:52:39,790
like an hour and a half so far.
Every time you get out of the thing,

2306
01:52:39,791 --> 01:52:44,791
it's exactly like the next day after a 
great mushroom trip where colors are 

2307
01:52:44,791 --> 01:52:46,190
brighter,
you just rested.

2308
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:47,720
It's super cool,
man.

2309
01:52:47,770 --> 01:52:49,540
I'm super.
I can't.

2310
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,740
I'm so and I haven't even gotten to the 
point of like,

2311
01:52:51,741 --> 01:52:56,741
all right,
what happens if I take a microdose of 

2312
01:52:56,741 --> 01:52:57,820
some psychoactive in this thing?
I haven't even gotten there yet.

2313
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:58,910
You do that though,

2314
01:53:01,410 --> 01:53:03,090
right?
Way To respond to that question.

2315
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:05,590
My favorite is eating pot.
If I,

2316
01:53:05,591 --> 01:53:07,900
if I ever ate too much pot and I was 
sitting around the house,

2317
01:53:07,901 --> 01:53:09,640
I jumped in and right immediately.
I don't want to waste it.

2318
01:53:10,890 --> 01:53:11,550
Yeah,
man.

2319
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:13,390
That's what I mean.
I guess that's a.

2320
01:53:13,410 --> 01:53:15,070
of course I've been eating pot and going
into.

2321
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:18,030
Of course I'm always eating pot.
Said the other day on stage,

2322
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:21,510
but when you brought me up on stage and 
the night of the ice house,

2323
01:53:21,710 --> 01:53:26,710
I was like,
Duncan is the only guy that will tell 

2324
01:53:26,710 --> 01:53:26,710
me,
man,

2325
01:53:26,710 --> 01:53:26,710
I got.
I fucking did acid.

2326
01:53:26,710 --> 01:53:26,710
I'm not.
I mean I did.

2327
01:53:26,710 --> 01:53:29,070
Emma will do mtms.
I did ecstasy.

2328
01:53:29,071 --> 01:53:30,480
I'm not doing that anymore,
man.

2329
01:53:30,481 --> 01:53:32,340
I'm fucking.
I haven't did anything for awhile.

2330
01:53:32,490 --> 01:53:34,260
She's eating weed everyday.
That's it.

2331
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:39,560
Like basically fucking almost sober.
I consider that.

2332
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:43,470
I know this is.
This is gonna seem like denial.

2333
01:53:43,471 --> 01:53:45,360
I'm sorry.
For those addicts out there.

2334
01:53:45,361 --> 01:53:48,600
Maybe I'm in denial,
but to me it does feel like coffee.

2335
01:53:48,601 --> 01:53:53,601
Like I place it in the same place.
I put coffee so it's not really to me 

2336
01:53:53,601 --> 01:53:55,120
like it does.
It's like something that I,

2337
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:58,800
I don't find to be destructive to my 
life at all.

2338
01:53:58,801 --> 01:54:03,670
I think alcohol was the monster and 
marijuana seems to just be a kind of,

2339
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:06,860
well I'll do it one better.
I worshiped coffee,

2340
01:54:07,170 --> 01:54:08,290
right.
Worship bit.

2341
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:13,390
Coffee is a ritual.
I have a ritual when I write and I have 

2342
01:54:13,390 --> 01:54:14,570
a ritual when I do podcasts and one of 
my.

2343
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:17,300
One of the big parts of my ritual is 
coffee,

2344
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:20,330
not like a monster energy drink.
I mean,

2345
01:54:20,331 --> 01:54:21,700
I don't have anything wrong.
I don't.

2346
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:23,810
Not like red bowls.
They're fine.

2347
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,040
If you just need a pick me up.
I'll drink wine.

2348
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:28,730
If I'm at the store and I know I'm tired
and I have to drive home,

2349
01:54:28,731 --> 01:54:32,030
I'll take a red bull,
but a coffee is like a ritual.

2350
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:35,080
I adore coffee.
I really do like,

2351
01:54:35,081 --> 01:54:40,081
I love to get like a nice warm cup of 
coffee and then I started writing and I 

2352
01:54:40,081 --> 01:54:41,450
do what I do.
A podcast like for me,

2353
01:54:41,451 --> 01:54:45,050
the podcast doesn't seem like it starts 
until I'd take a sip of coffee.

2354
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:46,370
Right.
So I love it.

2355
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:48,230
I love coffee.
I like the feeling,

2356
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:50,000
what it gives to me.
I liked the way it tastes.

2357
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:52,340
I feel the same way about pond.
I love it.

2358
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:52,970
It's.
I don't,

2359
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:54,650
I don't.
Not only do I not think,

2360
01:54:55,310 --> 01:54:57,590
I absolutely don't think it's 
detrimental.

2361
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:01,580
I adore it and I think it helps my life.
I adore it.

2362
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:06,760
I don't have any negatives.
I've figured me and pot of a fucking 

2363
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:10,541
super good relationship and sometimes it
leaves me tired and I can't remember 

2364
01:55:10,541 --> 01:55:14,801
exactly what I just said,
but it provides me with so much 

2365
01:55:14,801 --> 01:55:17,270
inspiration and introspective thinking 
that the,

2366
01:55:17,271 --> 01:55:18,320
the,
the counter,

2367
01:55:18,321 --> 01:55:20,090
like the payoff is huge

2368
01:55:20,810 --> 01:55:21,670
man.
Huge.

2369
01:55:21,710 --> 01:55:25,310
You add to that having a fucking hole in
the universe,

2370
01:55:25,311 --> 01:55:29,420
in your goddamn house.
Get out of town,

2371
01:55:29,421 --> 01:55:30,800
man.
You know what I'm saying?

2372
01:55:30,801 --> 01:55:32,120
I've been saying it forever.
Don't know.

2373
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:36,010
What have I been telling you for years?
You have to take God dammit.

2374
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:36,710
Donkey.
Yeah.

2375
01:55:36,711 --> 01:55:39,020
You would say that to me.
Like when I was like,

2376
01:55:39,021 --> 01:55:41,570
you would say it to me when I car's 
about to get repossessed.

2377
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:42,230
Like,
oh,

2378
01:55:42,260 --> 01:55:43,770
just get a flow.
Okay.

2379
01:55:43,771 --> 01:55:44,000
I

2380
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,570
told you anytime you wanted to get,
use mine,

2381
01:55:45,770 --> 01:55:49,130
you know that know you well yeah,
of course you have the keys to my house.

2382
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:54,150
You can come over 3:00
in the morning and he's my tank anytime 

2383
01:55:54,150 --> 01:55:54,150
you don't wake my kids up fucking 
Weirdo.

2384
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:58,050
How weird would that would be a Weirdo 
come daddy.

2385
01:55:58,051 --> 01:55:59,910
The weirdos here again,
the climate here,

2386
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:02,190
uncle,
Uncle Duncan,

2387
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:03,200
but man that.
Yeah,

2388
01:56:03,201 --> 01:56:05,180
it's a.
it's a beautiful town.

2389
01:56:05,190 --> 01:56:10,190
Beautiful happens and I think they 
should have community centers that have 

2390
01:56:10,190 --> 01:56:10,190
a man.
I mean,

2391
01:56:10,190 --> 01:56:14,211
so there's a lot of people that have 
apartments and in their apartment they 

2392
01:56:14,211 --> 01:56:16,551
have [inaudible].
They have a stationary bike or a 

2393
01:56:16,551 --> 01:56:18,590
treadmill.
They have a little small gym with a 

2394
01:56:18,590 --> 01:56:18,590
television set in there.
You want to have a nice apartment,

2395
01:56:18,590 --> 01:56:20,070
an apartment.
The fucking float tank can use.

2396
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,500
You have someone who maintains it.
People sign up for it.

2397
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:27,620
Don't let just anybody use it.
Make sure that the guy who runs into 

2398
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:30,620
creepers,
I'm going to peek in on chicks whether 

2399
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:30,620
in there naked,
put a lock on the door,

2400
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:32,400
make sure you know these people are 
going to shit in it.

2401
01:56:32,401 --> 01:56:33,510
There's no way around it.
He'll.

2402
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:35,470
You'll know who did it.
They have to sign up,

2403
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:40,540
right the fuck that guy will the victim 
that's you get evicted from the 

2404
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:42,890
apartment complex to fight on top of the
apartment conflict area manager.

2405
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:47,920
So went shit in that water.
It doesn't matter how many times they 

2406
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:47,920
filter it,
you're not getting all this shit out.

2407
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:50,280
You have to take all the water out and 
clean the whole thing that water.

2408
01:56:50,290 --> 01:56:55,290
The next time you climb in and there's 
going to be something in there that 

2409
01:56:55,290 --> 01:56:57,650
bites yet,
what do you think the number is 

2410
01:56:57,650 --> 01:56:58,920
worldwide of people that have taken big 
shifts in isolation tanks?

2411
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:00,280
Thousand Dollars.

2412
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:07,970
Imagine if there was a compilation video
of every person who has ever taken a 

2413
01:57:08,011 --> 01:57:11,180
shit inside the isolation tank and you 
can just watch it happen in real time.

2414
01:57:13,170 --> 01:57:14,250
People are awful.
You would.

2415
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:19,320
You'd be insisting that people are awful
and I think that's one of the real 

2416
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:20,130
problems with judging the human beings 
as a,

2417
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:22,440
as a race.
So there's too many of us.

2418
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:26,190
So if there's 7 billion people it,
while we're saying this,

2419
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:28,200
50 dudes are shitting and tanks right 
now,

2420
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:30,390
for sure,
right?

2421
01:57:30,450 --> 01:57:35,450
This tanks aren't even that common.
There's not that many tanks in the 

2422
01:57:35,450 --> 01:57:38,811
world,
but if people don't like the best over 

2423
01:57:38,811 --> 01:57:41,601
the course of this podcast,
I'll say over the course of this 

2424
01:57:41,601 --> 01:57:43,791
podcast,
and that's a conservative estimate 

2425
01:57:43,791 --> 01:57:43,791
taking how many fucking idiots there 
are.

2426
01:57:43,791 --> 01:57:44,640
That just shit their pants.
How many people are there?

2427
01:57:44,641 --> 01:57:49,641
They're so stupid.
They just shit their pants all the time 

2428
01:57:49,641 --> 01:57:50,070
necessarily a measurement of Iq.

2429
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:52,130
They shit their bed.
They,

2430
01:57:52,131 --> 01:57:52,950
you know,
when I was in,

2431
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:55,550
when I was in,
I had to,

2432
01:57:56,890 --> 01:57:58,300
I had a girlfriend.
I've told this story before,

2433
01:57:58,301 --> 01:58:00,090
but it's very unfortunate.
And her roommate,

2434
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:02,520
um,
used to have anal sex with her boyfriend

2435
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:05,470
and she wrote a letter about it that the
reason why he does it,

2436
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:10,790
he's a little dick and it doesn't feel 
good unless he puts it in her ass and 

2437
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:13,010
like it's very sobering for this poor 
gentleman and found this letter or her,

2438
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:15,090
her diary or whatever,
but shit,

2439
01:58:15,091 --> 01:58:17,190
the bed when they,
they had,

2440
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:21,570
they had anal sex and apparently it 
relaxed her sphincter to the point where

2441
01:58:21,571 --> 01:58:25,050
she just relaxed in bed while sleeping 
and just shat in the bed.

2442
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:30,680
And Yeah.
And like the dude was just standing in 

2443
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:32,631
the hallway like a random,
like I came out of my girlfriend's 

2444
01:58:32,631 --> 01:58:34,050
bedroom and he was there in the hall of 
his hands out.

2445
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:35,910
Like after she had just shit on him.
He was like,

2446
01:58:35,911 --> 01:58:40,911
what the fuck?
I never forget this poor,

2447
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:41,350
poor

2448
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:46,930
what the fuck someone just shit on him 
because he was having anal sex with this

2449
01:58:46,931 --> 01:58:51,880
girl he released.
So what I'm saying is that poor gal,

2450
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:53,970
with whatever damage he did to her 
butthole,

2451
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:57,220
she could probably shit the bed if she 
went to an isolation tank,

2452
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:58,720
you know,
she wasn't paying attention.

2453
01:58:58,721 --> 01:59:00,610
She got a little too relaxed and fell 
asleep in there.

2454
01:59:00,850 --> 01:59:05,850
You can get your bed,
you can shit an isolation tank area can 

2455
01:59:05,850 --> 01:59:06,280
and people shit the bed.
They just do.

2456
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:07,960
They just do.
Yeah,

2457
01:59:07,961 --> 01:59:10,090
I mean they do.
There's no way around it.

2458
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:11,040
I,
I get,

2459
01:59:11,120 --> 01:59:15,190
I guess I think of like if you were in 
there and like you had just blasted some

2460
01:59:15,191 --> 01:59:20,191
academy and into your bloodstream or 
south thing and you were just really 

2461
01:59:20,191 --> 01:59:24,121
gone and maybe your body will just 
evacuate it's bowels because it wanted 

2462
01:59:24,121 --> 01:59:24,190
to,
you know,

2463
01:59:24,191 --> 01:59:27,700
your astral body is,
who knows where you're on Venus,

2464
01:59:27,701 --> 01:59:29,070
you're not even in the float tank.

2465
01:59:29,100 --> 01:59:31,420
You're,
you're just a monkey in there now.

2466
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:32,860
Yeah,
I would imagine that's definitely,

2467
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:35,440
probably happened to somebody that took 
some drug.

2468
01:59:35,860 --> 01:59:36,610
Did you,
um,

2469
01:59:36,730 --> 01:59:39,280
have you talked to Neal Brennan at all?
Do you know Neil?

2470
01:59:39,430 --> 01:59:40,780
I know Neil,
but I haven't talked to him.

2471
01:59:40,870 --> 01:59:42,010
Wait,
I've got to take a leak.

2472
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:43,840
Please go ahead.
Go ahead and do it.

2473
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:46,050
And when you come back,
I'll return to you,

2474
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:48,820
its customer with your priestly priestly
outfit.

2475
01:59:49,300 --> 01:59:54,300
When you return,
I'll tell you about neal Brennan taking 

2476
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:54,300
ketamine for therapy.
Did you know about that?

2477
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:55,780
Come,
come back young Jesus.

2478
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:59,650
What are you a bishop or some shit?
He's a bishop.

2479
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:01,510
Duncan trussell.
Uh,

2480
02:00:01,511 --> 02:00:02,530
Bishop,
uh,

2481
02:00:02,531 --> 02:00:03,370
if you,
uh,

2482
02:00:03,460 --> 02:00:06,610
have never listened at Duncan trussell's
podcasts and you're tuning into this,

2483
02:00:06,611 --> 02:00:11,611
maybe this is the first podcast here,
we listened to the Duncan trussell 

2484
02:00:11,611 --> 02:00:14,431
family hour is for real,
like probably one of the best podcasts 

2485
02:00:14,431 --> 02:00:17,760
in the known universe and Duncan is a,
an oddly articulate and very bizarre 

2486
02:00:18,191 --> 02:00:20,140
character that I don't know anybody like
him,

2487
02:00:20,630 --> 02:00:24,280
you know,
and he has a very interesting and unique

2488
02:00:24,281 --> 02:00:25,240
way of looking at shit.

2489
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:30,600
And one of the reason why I like doing 
podcasts with them because I feel like 

2490
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:33,931
that when Duncan and I get together,
we both pull some weird part out of each

2491
02:00:34,031 --> 02:00:39,031
other.
That's what I felt like when we were 

2492
02:00:39,031 --> 02:00:40,990
doing that stupid Scifi show when we 
were talking to people about bigfoot and

2493
02:00:40,991 --> 02:00:45,991
shit.
But that's how I feel when I do any 

2494
02:00:45,991 --> 02:00:45,991
podcasts with him.
He's just a very,

2495
02:00:45,991 --> 02:00:48,880
very unusual dude.
And His standup is fucking hilarious and

2496
02:00:48,881 --> 02:00:52,750
he will be with me at the comedy store 
this Friday night.

2497
02:00:52,930 --> 02:00:57,930
We're doing the belly room at 10:00.
I don't even think the tickets are 

2498
02:00:57,930 --> 02:01:01,321
available yet,
but this Friday night at the belly room 

2499
02:01:01,321 --> 02:01:01,600
at 10:00,
it would just be me and Duncan.

2500
02:01:01,601 --> 02:01:06,601
That's it.
And it's only like 70 tickets so it 

2501
02:01:06,601 --> 02:01:07,300
sells out very quick.
So,

2502
02:01:07,301 --> 02:01:08,140
uh,
if you're interested in,

2503
02:01:08,141 --> 02:01:10,000
I'm doing Saturday night at the same 
time to,

2504
02:01:10,001 --> 02:01:12,670
at 10:00.
So that's it.

2505
02:01:13,090 --> 02:01:18,090
Fuckers,
Duncan trussell family hour is on 

2506
02:01:18,090 --> 02:01:19,120
itunes.
He doesn't have any standup that you can

2507
02:01:19,121 --> 02:01:24,121
buy unfortunately.
And that's something I've been hounding 

2508
02:01:24,121 --> 02:01:27,211
Dunkin for the longest.
Fucking timely enters his little girl 

2509
02:01:27,211 --> 02:01:30,451
bladder.
It's one thing I've learned about 

2510
02:01:30,451 --> 02:01:32,161
myself,
young Jamie from doing this podcast and 

2511
02:01:32,161 --> 02:01:34,381
I have a manly bladder.
I can drink four cups of coffee and sit 

2512
02:01:34,381 --> 02:01:36,040
here for three fucking hours and not 
bitch out and make them mad.

2513
02:01:36,041 --> 02:01:39,830
Run for the bathroom most days,
most days.

2514
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:41,870
But I've had some,
I've had some bad days,

2515
02:01:41,871 --> 02:01:43,610
I've had some days where I couldn't keep
it together.

2516
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:45,290
Sister,
part of being a person.

2517
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:50,680
So if you can please give Duncan the 
hardest time possible about putting 

2518
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:53,270
together a goddamn comedy specials so 
you all can enjoy his standup,

2519
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:56,130
his brother.
Praise,

2520
02:01:57,990 --> 02:02:00,950
praise,
praise zoo.

2521
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:02,190
Save tour,
man.

2522
02:02:02,191 --> 02:02:03,450
Big Tour.
It's happening.

2523
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:05,840
I can't talk about it.
My amazing agent,

2524
02:02:05,841 --> 02:02:09,030
Joe Schwartz,
the secret.

2525
02:02:09,090 --> 02:02:11,040
They're going to be good though.
It's happening.

2526
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:11,730
It is happening.

2527
02:02:12,610 --> 02:02:17,610
Do.
When were you doing some gigs together 

2528
02:02:17,610 --> 02:02:17,610
again?
We haven't done gigs,

2529
02:02:17,610 --> 02:02:17,610
but we're doing Friday night at the 
comedy store,

2530
02:02:17,610 --> 02:02:19,460
but we got to do some good gigs.
I now go away from Los Angeles.

2531
02:02:19,461 --> 02:02:20,290
Tuck.
Yeah friend.

2532
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:22,020
Let's do travel.
Yeah,

2533
02:02:22,150 --> 02:02:23,480
let's travel.
Love to.

2534
02:02:24,010 --> 02:02:29,010
We need to do something where we do we 
do a series of dates on the road.

2535
02:02:29,570 --> 02:02:30,890
You and I.
This is what I'm thinking.

2536
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:35,060
Go to these different towns and then go 
do cool shit in the town and film it.

2537
02:02:35,270 --> 02:02:36,710
Like,
let's go to an Ashram.

2538
02:02:36,890 --> 02:02:37,330
Let's,
uh,

2539
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:40,010
let's take a yoga class together.
Let's do a bunch of shit.

2540
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:41,840
Is Weird Shit.
Specific to the task.

2541
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:44,000
Let's float tank and every time.
Yeah,

2542
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:49,270
let's go to the Kentucky Derby.
I want to do the Kentucky Derby next 

2543
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:52,210
year and do a standup show in town.
I want to know what the fuck that's all 

2544
02:02:52,210 --> 02:02:54,881
about.
Horse racing was not even about the 

2545
02:02:54,881 --> 02:02:54,881
race,
so at everybody getting fucked up.

2546
02:02:55,010 --> 02:02:56,810
That's what it's about,
right?

2547
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:58,830
My Buddy Cameron hanes went this year 
and you're like,

2548
02:02:58,831 --> 02:03:00,560
Jesus Christ.
He's like,

2549
02:03:00,561 --> 02:03:03,170
it's just people just getting drunk like
everywhere you go.

2550
02:03:03,171 --> 02:03:06,470
Everyone is just plowed by a hunter.
Thompson.

2551
02:03:06,471 --> 02:03:11,471
One of his early pieces of work that got
him notoriety was he did a bit on the 

2552
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:17,740
Kentucky Derby.
The Kentucky Derby is decadent and 

2553
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:17,740
deprived and his store in the Kentucky 
Derby.

2554
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:22,320
It's fascinating because it starts out 
just just describing the heinous people 

2555
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:25,790
around them and then realizing you're 
one of those people.

2556
02:03:25,970 --> 02:03:29,000
At the end he realized he's one of the 
monsters that he's been describing.

2557
02:03:30,350 --> 02:03:33,020
That's awesome,
but it's just one of those things.

2558
02:03:33,021 --> 02:03:38,021
It's been going on forever and it's like
connected to this ancient culture of 

2559
02:03:38,460 --> 02:03:40,580
riverboat gamblers.
You know?

2560
02:03:40,581 --> 02:03:42,110
I mean,
that's what the Kentucky Derby is like.

2561
02:03:42,111 --> 02:03:45,890
The ultimate gambler experience.
Drunken excess.

2562
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:49,070
It's like mint Juleps.
It's that.

2563
02:03:49,071 --> 02:03:51,770
It's getting hammered and it's horse 
races,

2564
02:03:52,220 --> 02:03:55,580
but it's like this,
it's like a social event where people go

2565
02:03:55,581 --> 02:03:58,580
and have a great time and apparently the
vibe there is incredible.

2566
02:03:58,581 --> 02:04:03,581
Like it's like really fun,
like chaotic and people do just get 

2567
02:04:03,581 --> 02:04:07,571
fucking shit faced shit faced and I 
think if we went and got shit faced with

2568
02:04:09,801 --> 02:04:10,490
these people.

2569
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:12,580
Yeah.
That can be super fun man.

2570
02:04:12,581 --> 02:04:15,300
I mean there's places to go get shit 
faced out.

2571
02:04:15,301 --> 02:04:15,740
Right?
Right,

2572
02:04:15,770 --> 02:04:20,770
right.
But I want to experience the Kentucky 

2573
02:04:20,770 --> 02:04:22,860
Derby.
The Kentucky Derby is something that 

2574
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:22,860
I've heard of.
I don't know enough about.

2575
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:22,860
Even like,
yeah,

2576
02:04:22,860 --> 02:04:24,280
sure.
Like why don't we do that man.

2577
02:04:24,281 --> 02:04:29,281
We could just go to burning man.
Isn't that large?

2578
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:34,420
A bunch of horses gallop around 
alcoholics.

2579
02:04:34,510 --> 02:04:39,510
When you go to the middle of the desert 
where there's shooting laser beams into 

2580
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:43,101
space and giant squid tanks are rolling 
by shooting fire or we could do both.

2581
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:46,500
That's impossible.
That's not the.

2582
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:49,530
That's on different dates now.
I know I'm joking.

2583
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:51,210
Can do both.
Yeah.

2584
02:04:51,630 --> 02:04:56,630
That's what we should've done for.
So to you and me looking for a 

2585
02:04:56,630 --> 02:04:59,310
nonexistent unknown primate wandering 
through the woods of the Pacific 

2586
02:04:59,310 --> 02:05:00,870
northwest,
we should have gone to raves.

2587
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:02,520
We should have found real freaks.

2588
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:04,750
I don't understand why,
you know,

2589
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:06,420
I don't understand.
Yeah,

2590
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:11,450
you're right.
There's so many other ways to like 

2591
02:05:11,450 --> 02:05:13,551
analyze the universe.
Like we're as far as science goes or 

2592
02:05:13,551 --> 02:05:18,521
somebody who's going to do a scientific 
investigation if things were pretty far 

2593
02:05:18,521 --> 02:05:22,941
away from the ideal scientist and we 
weren't really doing science and we're 

2594
02:05:22,941 --> 02:05:25,620
looking for bigfoot bullshit detecting 
where you really are doing now.

2595
02:05:25,621 --> 02:05:27,090
But I,
you know what I mean man.

2596
02:05:27,091 --> 02:05:29,460
I think that it's like what,
what ends up happening?

2597
02:05:29,730 --> 02:05:33,270
Because TV shows have got to like having
to wrap everything up.

2598
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:35,220
You got to have a point.
You got to have a thing.

2599
02:05:35,221 --> 02:05:38,340
You can't do what a podcast dies,
which is just whatever you want.

2600
02:05:38,341 --> 02:05:40,410
And I can't they do that.
I don't know.

2601
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,810
I don't know.
I guess I don't know.

2602
02:05:43,811 --> 02:05:46,140
I mean why can't they have like a late 
night show that,

2603
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:48,570
why don't they have a late night show 
look after and I chose over.

2604
02:05:48,570 --> 02:05:51,030
That just goes on for like three hours.
I don't know,

2605
02:05:51,570 --> 02:05:56,570
I'm just.
It's just two dudes talking or whatever 

2606
02:05:56,570 --> 02:05:56,770
and a guest and talk.
No band.

2607
02:05:56,820 --> 02:05:57,780
No,
you're a fucking band.

2608
02:05:57,810 --> 02:06:02,810
Come on.
What are you a baby and I need to play 

2609
02:06:02,810 --> 02:06:04,281
music for you.
I think people would take great comfort 

2610
02:06:04,281 --> 02:06:08,391
in that,
but the problem is you can't do it 

2611
02:06:08,391 --> 02:06:11,150
because of the way TV works.
Every single thing that anybody says on 

2612
02:06:11,150 --> 02:06:14,691
tv,
he's got to go through a filter and 

2613
02:06:14,691 --> 02:06:14,880
that's the,
what do you call it,

2614
02:06:14,881 --> 02:06:18,090
the regulatory bureau that makes sure 
people say that.

2615
02:06:18,091 --> 02:06:23,091
People say things that aren't like curse
words or what's that called?

2616
02:06:23,791 --> 02:06:26,010
There's a name for it.
Standards and practices,

2617
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:30,330
so everything has to run through that.
So I think that the idea of having.

2618
02:06:30,350 --> 02:06:32,730
And you could do it on Hbo,
I guess you'd have to have it on a.

2619
02:06:33,350 --> 02:06:38,350
on a non a public station.
It needs to be a subscription TV 

2620
02:06:38,971 --> 02:06:40,380
station.
You could probably pull that off,

2621
02:06:40,381 --> 02:06:45,381
but you can't do it on NBC.
You can't have people talk for three 

2622
02:06:45,381 --> 02:06:48,561
hours because inevitably somebody is 
going to start really saying the truth 

2623
02:06:48,561 --> 02:06:52,911
or they're going to start saying a truth
that doesn't fit in with selling cell 

2624
02:06:52,911 --> 02:06:53,520
phones in mass,
and that's going to be.

2625
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:57,660
They're not going to like that.
When you do stand up on those shows,

2626
02:06:57,661 --> 02:06:59,100
you've got to show them your set,
right?

2627
02:06:59,370 --> 02:07:01,830
They analyze every line,
every sentence,

2628
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:07,220
every word gets analyzed.
You have to show them like a written 

2629
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:10,911
transcript of things are going to say.
Can you imagine if we tried to show a 

2630
02:07:10,911 --> 02:07:13,230
network this transcript of what we 
talked about here today,

2631
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:15,200
like the notes,
how many I.

2632
02:07:15,201 --> 02:07:20,201
I imagined that we would get over 7,000
pages of notes back.

2633
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:25,460
I bet the notes that we get would be 500
times longer than the episode itself.

2634
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:30,680
Did I ever tell you that?
My friend Amir was a writer on the 

2635
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:30,680
early,
early,

2636
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:35,091
early days of Conan.
Now through a lot of comics wrote for 

2637
02:07:35,091 --> 02:07:35,920
Conan in the early,
early days,

2638
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:38,050
and my friend Amir,
Amir Golan,

2639
02:07:38,051 --> 02:07:39,940
he was,
his name is James Lemur.

2640
02:07:39,941 --> 02:07:42,010
That was a stage name.
Really Funny Dude from Boston,

2641
02:07:42,370 --> 02:07:47,110
he and so I was there for the early,
early filmings when I was like,

2642
02:07:47,111 --> 02:07:50,220
you know,
I guess I was like kind of working maybe

2643
02:07:50,230 --> 02:07:55,230
like just starting to work and go,
well I didn't have any money and I was 

2644
02:07:55,230 --> 02:07:55,230
told scrub,
but I was his friends.

2645
02:07:55,230 --> 02:07:56,650
I went to botch and they,
they all,

2646
02:07:56,651 --> 02:08:01,651
the Andy Richter,
Conan O'brien interactions were 

2647
02:08:01,651 --> 02:08:01,651
scripted.
One hundred percent scripted.

2648
02:08:01,651 --> 02:08:04,120
They had cue cards above them so they 
weren't talking.

2649
02:08:04,630 --> 02:08:07,070
They were fake.
They're fake talking like,

2650
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:09,640
like if you and I,
we're going to talk about this right now

2651
02:08:09,641 --> 02:08:14,641
and it would have all this shit that I 
was going to say already written out and

2652
02:08:15,430 --> 02:08:20,430
it was a sign behind each other,
like a sign behind the Indian guy 

2653
02:08:20,430 --> 02:08:24,451
holding the sign behind Kona because 
we're talking about like 1990 or some 

2654
02:08:24,451 --> 02:08:24,451
shit.

2655
02:08:24,451 --> 02:08:28,320
When did the Conan O'brien show start?
What year did the Conan O'brien show 

2656
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:28,780
start?
I'm going to say like 91 or 92.

2657
02:08:29,170 --> 02:08:32,380
Somewhere around there.
That's if I had to guess at the latest,

2658
02:08:32,381 --> 02:08:35,140
I could think it'd be like 93.
But it was weird.

2659
02:08:35,590 --> 02:08:37,300
Weird.
It's really weird.

2660
02:08:37,301 --> 02:08:40,270
It's like you're watching pirates of the
Caribbean or something,

2661
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:44,260
so it's straight,
but they don't do that anymore.

2662
02:08:44,410 --> 02:08:49,410
Thank God.
But I mean he had to go to fucking tbs 

2663
02:08:49,410 --> 02:08:49,630
to probably get rid of the 93.
There we go.

2664
02:08:50,190 --> 02:08:51,310
That was pretty close.
Yeah.

2665
02:08:51,450 --> 02:08:53,350
I don't get that man.
I mean it's so I,

2666
02:08:53,351 --> 02:08:55,420
I can't wait for that to change.
That's.

2667
02:08:55,450 --> 02:08:57,730
TV's going to get so much better.
They don't do that anymore.

2668
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:58,990
Nobody does.
Nobody does that.

2669
02:08:58,991 --> 02:09:01,840
They did that because he was a writer 
who did that because he was a writer.

2670
02:09:01,841 --> 02:09:06,841
They really didn't have a performance 
background and all of a sudden he was 

2671
02:09:06,841 --> 02:09:09,601
hosting this late night talk show 
because he was so funny because in 

2672
02:09:09,601 --> 02:09:11,710
writer's rooms,
Conan O'brien would just smash.

2673
02:09:11,860 --> 02:09:16,860
He was the guy.
He was so fucking funny and his jokes 

2674
02:09:16,860 --> 02:09:17,830
were so good that in writer's rooms they
will like Jesus Christ,

2675
02:09:17,831 --> 02:09:19,560
you should be a fucking comic.
Like should be.

2676
02:09:19,740 --> 02:09:22,150
You should be the host of a show.
And then the next thing you know,

2677
02:09:22,151 --> 02:09:23,710
a bunch of people got behind him and 
they said,

2678
02:09:23,711 --> 02:09:24,910
listen,
we're gonna bankroll him.

2679
02:09:24,911 --> 02:09:26,520
I'll have him do the guy.
And you know,

2680
02:09:26,830 --> 02:09:29,740
once he loosened up and got used to the 
role,

2681
02:09:29,741 --> 02:09:30,400
I mean,
you know,

2682
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:34,030
he became like one of a lot of people's 
favorite.

2683
02:09:34,860 --> 02:09:37,570
Watching the early show and watching 
them do it.

2684
02:09:37,571 --> 02:09:39,750
Like what a script.
It was very enlightenment.

2685
02:09:39,810 --> 02:09:42,500
What would you do this as a late night 
show to.

2686
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:44,830
I'm sure you've gotten.
Someone has got.

2687
02:09:44,890 --> 02:09:47,560
Must've come to you by now.
This is early morning show.

2688
02:09:47,561 --> 02:09:49,870
It's a late night show.
It's a mid afternoon show.

2689
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:52,630
It's available whenever you want it.
It's 24 hours a day,

2690
02:09:52,631 --> 02:09:53,610
seven days a week.
And.

2691
02:09:54,110 --> 02:09:59,110
But do you ever think about like how,
how often do you think about translating

2692
02:09:59,981 --> 02:10:02,700
it to the TV environment or something?
Never.

2693
02:10:02,950 --> 02:10:04,720
Almost never.
Almost never.

2694
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:06,450
You must get pitched all the time.
No,

2695
02:10:06,490 --> 02:10:07,990
I don't know.
I don't even,

2696
02:10:08,050 --> 02:10:09,250
I don't even take pitches.

2697
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:13,390
I don't want to do anything other than 
what I'm doing right now.

2698
02:10:13,450 --> 02:10:15,320
I've thought about it before and you 
know the,

2699
02:10:15,470 --> 02:10:17,350
the experience of doing the spike TV 
thing,

2700
02:10:17,820 --> 02:10:20,710
the Scifi thing rather.
What was fun was doing with you.

2701
02:10:20,910 --> 02:10:21,730
That's what it was.
Fun.

2702
02:10:21,790 --> 02:10:26,790
That was what was fun,
but it's not fun dealing with all those 

2703
02:10:26,790 --> 02:10:26,830
other people.
Not The people that we worked with.

2704
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:31,860
Although the producers on that side were
great and a lot of people in the 

2705
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:31,860
networks that were great,
but there were so many voices.

2706
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:36,630
It wasn't even that they were bad folks.
You're dealing with too many people in 

2707
02:10:36,630 --> 02:10:39,971
it.
Everybody's got discrepancies and I 

2708
02:10:39,971 --> 02:10:39,971
think it should go like this and maybe 
you should try that.

2709
02:10:39,971 --> 02:10:41,060
Or maybe you can come in here.
Maybe he could dress different.

2710
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:43,790
Maybe you could hold that or maybe you 
could stand there like,

2711
02:10:43,791 --> 02:10:44,780
fuck man.

2712
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:46,670
There's too many of you talking like,
look,

2713
02:10:46,671 --> 02:10:51,671
we're trying to make the best thing,
but you're not the person that's going 

2714
02:10:51,671 --> 02:10:52,160
to like figure me out.
Okay.

2715
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:57,700
I've got a good sense of who I am and if
you want me to wear a suit and tie and 

2716
02:10:57,700 --> 02:11:01,310
you think it's going to change.
If I come in on a parachute or if I step

2717
02:11:01,311 --> 02:11:04,640
out of a fucking flaming Hula Hoop,
we're talking crazy.

2718
02:11:05,060 --> 02:11:07,030
I don't want to do that.
Like if I had,

2719
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:10,490
if I want to sit down with some comedy 
writers and bounce around some ideas,

2720
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:13,940
I don't want a year to many people's 
voices and that.

2721
02:11:13,941 --> 02:11:15,950
I mean it's their prerogative.
I mean if you're,

2722
02:11:15,951 --> 02:11:18,350
if you're on a television show or 
somebody wants to pay for it,

2723
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:19,280
right?
And it's not you.

2724
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:21,230
So it's their prerogative to do that.
But I don't want to be.

2725
02:11:21,231 --> 02:11:26,231
I don't,
I just don't think I operate the best 

2726
02:11:26,231 --> 02:11:26,231
doing that.

2727
02:11:26,231 --> 02:11:28,630
Right.
I don't think this podcast would have 

2728
02:11:28,630 --> 02:11:29,060
ever occurred if I had a boss who would 
have never happened now and most of this

2729
02:11:29,061 --> 02:11:32,810
shit I would've never said and I would 
have to like debate who the guests were.

2730
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:35,730
The idea of debating who the guests are 
make me wants to.

2731
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:40,990
I just want to throw up like the idea of
have to convince someone that Joey Diaz 

2732
02:11:40,990 --> 02:11:42,540
should be on Tuesday.
I've got to convince them.

2733
02:11:42,690 --> 02:11:45,230
I know Joe has been on two months ago,
but it doesn't matter.

2734
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:48,140
You need a black guy.
You need a black woman.

2735
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:49,940
That's what you need on your podcast,
a black woman.

2736
02:11:49,941 --> 02:11:51,770
What we're looking at your diversity 
statistics,

2737
02:11:52,470 --> 02:11:57,470
right?
I'm going to do what the fuck I want to 

2738
02:11:57,470 --> 02:11:58,430
do and do whatever I want to do,
and the only way to do whatever you want

2739
02:11:58,431 --> 02:11:59,600
to do is to do your own thing.

2740
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:01,430
As soon as you start doing it on 
television,

2741
02:12:01,431 --> 02:12:05,410
you're not doing whatever you want to do
unless you become wildly successful like

2742
02:12:05,420 --> 02:12:10,420
south park,
to the point where they just leave you 

2743
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:11,450
the fuck alone and new regimes come and 
go while you're still the king.

2744
02:12:11,810 --> 02:12:14,360
They just,
they don't say shit to Daniel Tosh.

2745
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:17,000
Everybody just shuts the fuck up and 
leaves them alone.

2746
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:20,150
You don't want to fuck that up.
You got a monolithic show.

2747
02:12:20,180 --> 02:12:23,150
Lucky South Park.
It's been going on forever and it's just

2748
02:12:23,151 --> 02:12:28,151
as funny now as it's ever been.
Just stay the fuck away from them or 

2749
02:12:28,151 --> 02:12:28,151
don't talk to them.
Don't ruin anything.

2750
02:12:28,151 --> 02:12:32,660
Are there any examples of a show where 
they let them do whatever they want at 

2751
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:35,910
and the show failed because of it?
I'm sure.

2752
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,270
I'm sure there have been no what it is.
I don't know.

2753
02:12:38,290 --> 02:12:43,290
There's got to be generally always here 
with like Mr show or like a lot of the 

2754
02:12:43,290 --> 02:12:45,360
great sketch groups or like any great 
show.

2755
02:12:45,361 --> 02:12:50,361
One thing you always hear,
it's like they mostly just let us do 

2756
02:12:50,361 --> 02:12:52,300
what we want it and it's the.
It's when the opposite effect happens.

2757
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:53,920
Well,
that's what the Chappelle show.

2758
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:57,400
That's what broke the Chappelle show up.
Dave Chappelle was like,

2759
02:12:57,401 --> 02:13:02,401
fuck this.
There's too many people telling them 

2760
02:13:02,401 --> 02:13:02,710
what to do.
Saying them that he couldn't say certain

2761
02:13:02,711 --> 02:13:03,940
things,
couldn't you know?

2762
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:06,460
There was a lot of money on the line for
that show.

2763
02:13:07,660 --> 02:13:10,150
He's talked about it.
He's talked about.

2764
02:13:10,151 --> 02:13:11,350
They wouldn't let him say the word 
nigger.

2765
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:16,380
Like there was a.
There was a real concern with him 

2766
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:16,380
continuing to say that word.
That's crazy.

2767
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:20,970
And they were saying that if he didn't 
say they could make more money in 

2768
02:13:20,970 --> 02:13:21,280
advertising,
I would love to really sit down with him

2769
02:13:21,281 --> 02:13:23,270
and find out what was.
What was like,

2770
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:26,200
what was the feeling when all that was 
happening?

2771
02:13:26,330 --> 02:13:30,970
What was the feeling of being connected 
to this cultural monster rage?

2772
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:33,620
I was on it twice,
but I didn't.

2773
02:13:33,850 --> 02:13:35,120
I didn't really talk to them about.

2774
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:36,690
It was in the time.
It was just like,

2775
02:13:36,691 --> 02:13:37,680
wow,
this is great.

2776
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:39,810
Dane's got this awesome show.
That's hilarious.

2777
02:13:39,930 --> 02:13:40,680
Holy Shit.
Fuck.

2778
02:13:40,681 --> 02:13:42,030
I'd love to be on it.
It was one of those things.

2779
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:43,350
It wasn't like,
like,

2780
02:13:43,351 --> 02:13:44,680
what is this like for you?
Like,

2781
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:46,860
like now having the podcast.
I'd be like,

2782
02:13:46,861 --> 02:13:51,861
what is it?
What is the feeling of everywhere you 

2783
02:13:51,861 --> 02:13:52,380
go.
I'm Rick James Pitch.

2784
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:53,970
Yeah.
Did that fuck with you?

2785
02:13:53,971 --> 02:13:58,971
Because I know people used to heckle him
with that and it was like a real 

2786
02:13:58,971 --> 02:13:58,971
problem.
Right?

2787
02:13:58,971 --> 02:13:59,970
Like people would heckle.
They would yell that out.

2788
02:13:59,971 --> 02:14:01,110
You know,
everybody was yelling out,

2789
02:14:01,111 --> 02:14:03,540
I'm Rick James Bitch.
It was ridiculous.

2790
02:14:04,110 --> 02:14:06,880
They got to the point where they would 
yell it out and he couldn't even compete

2791
02:14:06,930 --> 02:14:09,400
continuous show because like dumb white 
kids,

2792
02:14:09,401 --> 02:14:11,370
it'd be yelling out,
I'm Rick James Bitch.

2793
02:14:11,730 --> 02:14:14,820
So bad.
It's so fucked up is that.

2794
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:19,820
But obviously he made it through it,
but the point being what a weird 

2795
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:22,710
experience that must have been just to 
be a human being,

2796
02:14:22,711 --> 02:14:27,711
to be at the tip of the comedy spear 
like that for a while and then have a 

2797
02:14:27,711 --> 02:14:32,061
bunch of people fuck with it.
Have a bunch of people just wouldn't 

2798
02:14:32,061 --> 02:14:32,430
make David.
You need to listen to David,

2799
02:14:32,590 --> 02:14:36,300
David two lane.
Uh,

2800
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:40,350
Mr Chappelle thing about all the money 
you're leaving on the table.

2801
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:42,780
How many people telling him what words 
to use.

2802
02:14:42,781 --> 02:14:44,850
And not to say that don't be yourself.
No,

2803
02:14:44,851 --> 02:14:45,180
no,
no.

2804
02:14:45,181 --> 02:14:47,460
We need to do,
to be a little better packaged.

2805
02:14:47,790 --> 02:14:49,630
We're trying to make money here.
David's right.

2806
02:14:49,890 --> 02:14:54,890
We're trying to make money.
And so he walked away like a gangster 

2807
02:14:54,890 --> 02:14:56,520
from some,
like $50 million dollar deal.

2808
02:14:56,580 --> 02:14:58,390
That's right.
Good.

2809
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,700
See Ya.
Integrity.

2810
02:14:59,701 --> 02:15:02,160
That guy's got serious integrity man.
Through his,

2811
02:15:02,910 --> 02:15:07,910
through his pores.
How many people would down a lot of 

2812
02:15:07,910 --> 02:15:08,040
people who would not walk me?

2813
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:13,570
Yeah.
Would be like the n word.

2814
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:15,070
It's unimportant.
You know?

2815
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:18,610
I think bill crosby wants to saying 
that.

2816
02:15:18,611 --> 02:15:19,210
I'm like,
yeah,

2817
02:15:19,211 --> 02:15:24,211
I was thinking I definitely wanted it 
for a second.

2818
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:30,020
What I was thinking for a second,
I was thinking of like other people in 

2819
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:30,020
my mind I'm going to be like,
yeah,

2820
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:32,890
they definitely wouldn't work him.
And I'm like judgmental shit.

2821
02:15:34,420 --> 02:15:36,810
Fucking top of it,
Paul.

2822
02:15:36,811 --> 02:15:40,150
If people walk away,
you as I look,

2823
02:15:40,151 --> 02:15:42,160
I hosted fear factor.
Sure.

2824
02:15:42,161 --> 02:15:43,970
I'll change my name.
What'd you want to call me?

2825
02:15:45,610 --> 02:15:46,380
Yeah,
sure.

2826
02:15:46,390 --> 02:15:49,060
Senior poopy pants shall be senior boot.
Oh yeah,

2827
02:15:49,061 --> 02:15:50,690
I'll share.
I'll go into the float tanks and someone

2828
02:15:50,691 --> 02:15:54,760
just shit it ain't no prob mats me Senor
poopy pants for Citibank.

2829
02:15:54,761 --> 02:15:56,470
Mastercard.
Citibank.

2830
02:15:56,471 --> 02:16:00,060
Mastercard is the best mastercard.
It's the one senior poopy pants.

2831
02:16:00,061 --> 02:16:01,690
Use it.
Why not?

2832
02:16:01,691 --> 02:16:03,740
You know what?
But why he wasn't Chappelle.

2833
02:16:03,741 --> 02:16:04,080
Kind of

2834
02:16:04,190 --> 02:16:06,950
like wasn't,
isn't he?

2835
02:16:07,140 --> 02:16:09,810
I don't know if he's still is busy.
Kind of like an illuminati believer,

2836
02:16:09,811 --> 02:16:12,300
like aren't there interviews with him 
where he kind of talks about,

2837
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:15,450
well look,
I don't know.

2838
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:18,570
I haven't had these conversations with 
him personally,

2839
02:16:18,930 --> 02:16:21,360
so I don't know the full extent of his 
beliefs,

2840
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:24,690
but he believes in some shit that's 
real.

2841
02:16:24,691 --> 02:16:27,180
Like the Bilderberg group,
the fact that these industrial,

2842
02:16:27,181 --> 02:16:30,040
it's really do get together and meet and
try

2843
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:35,040
to figure out how to continue running 
the world the way it's run right now 

2844
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:35,950
because they're extracting massive 
amounts of money from it.

2845
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:39,250
I mean that's real.
We know that the Bilderberg group,

2846
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:43,630
those are real meetings.
We know that the federal bank.

2847
02:16:43,870 --> 02:16:46,720
Okay.
W We know how that works.

2848
02:16:46,990 --> 02:16:48,750
We know that the federal bank isn't 
bank.

2849
02:16:48,840 --> 02:16:53,840
It's not federal.
It's just it's a privately owned 

2850
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:56,641
company.
We know that international banks and as 

2851
02:16:56,641 --> 02:17:01,340
well as well as the banks in this 
country have all done all sorts of 

2852
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:04,291
horrible shit involving laundering money
and gotten little slaps on the wrist and

2853
02:17:04,510 --> 02:17:07,810
a little baby fines and when they're 
about to fall apart,

2854
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:12,700
our own tax dollars are used to step in 
and save these fuckheads.

2855
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:16,270
We all know all that,
yet we all know that.

2856
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:17,550
We just sort of accept it.

2857
02:17:19,060 --> 02:17:21,550
Yeah.
Kennedy shot in broad daylight.

2858
02:17:23,730 --> 02:17:28,730
There's so much of what it is to be a 
person that runs a government that no 

2859
02:17:30,601 --> 02:17:33,420
one other than that person or those 
people is ever going to understand.

2860
02:17:34,170 --> 02:17:39,170
I think it's probably like a helpless 
position where you realize once you get 

2861
02:17:39,170 --> 02:17:39,330
there like,
Oh God,

2862
02:17:39,331 --> 02:17:40,410
this isn't.
Nobody does this.

2863
02:17:40,411 --> 02:17:41,310
Right.
It can't be done.

2864
02:17:41,311 --> 02:17:42,020
Right.
Right.

2865
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:47,080
Literally can't be done.
I'm going to try to do my best to get 

2866
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:47,080
some healthcare pushed through some 
other,

2867
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:48,630
some other things.
Maybe gay marriage,

2868
02:17:49,740 --> 02:17:52,020
gay marriage on the books.
Fuck Yeah,

2869
02:17:52,021 --> 02:17:53,910
man,
that guy's having a great week.

2870
02:17:55,100 --> 02:17:56,610
Great Week.
He really is.

2871
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:57,270
Yeah.
I,

2872
02:17:57,280 --> 02:17:58,280
you know.
Yeah.

2873
02:17:58,290 --> 02:17:59,940
I don't know.
We don't know.

2874
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:05,120
That is the belief that the president 
has a kind of hapless victim that gets 

2875
02:18:06,301 --> 02:18:11,301
pulled into a web of darkness and does 
the best that he can do is certainly 

2876
02:18:11,301 --> 02:18:14,220
more comforting than the other version 
of the story,

2877
02:18:14,221 --> 02:18:19,221
which is that it's just somebody who's a
narcissist to trick themselves into 

2878
02:18:19,221 --> 02:18:22,611
thinking they were some capital is Jesus
and then they're going to walk across 

2879
02:18:22,611 --> 02:18:27,171
the stage of history and create 
incredible changes for the better in the

2880
02:18:27,241 --> 02:18:31,020
world while hoping to God that the 
people you're creating the changes for.

2881
02:18:31,020 --> 02:18:36,020
We'll forget about the countless 
children you've transformed into 

2882
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:36,020
hamburger meat

2883
02:18:36,020 --> 02:18:40,160
from dropping bombs at a drop drawings 
on top of them accidentally and they we 

2884
02:18:40,251 --> 02:18:42,750
do because maybe it is a game.
You start thinking,

2885
02:18:42,751 --> 02:18:47,751
is it.
This is like a game of thrones style 

2886
02:18:47,751 --> 02:18:49,611
universe where you know every decision 
that you make are five percent of the 

2887
02:18:49,611 --> 02:18:54,261
decisions you make are going to result 
in someone dying and someone not dying 

2888
02:18:54,261 --> 02:18:55,530
and you're forced into the predicament 
of saying,

2889
02:18:55,531 --> 02:19:00,531
wow.
I guess if I have to pick between dying 

2890
02:19:00,531 --> 02:19:02,901
and not dying,
I'm going to pick people from the 

2891
02:19:02,901 --> 02:19:04,731
country.
I'm currently the president of over the 

2892
02:19:04,731 --> 02:19:04,900
people from the country.
I'm not the president of.

2893
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:09,920
That's going to be the decision I have 
to make because that's the oath that 

2894
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:10,800
I've sworn.
So yeah,

2895
02:19:10,801 --> 02:19:15,801
from time to time I'm going to,
I'm going to explode some fucking kids 

2896
02:19:15,801 --> 02:19:19,400
and I'm also gonna get gay marriage 
legalized and I'm also going to help 

2897
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:22,540
ease the prohibition on marijuana and 
then once a month while

2898
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:27,840
I will completely destroy a village.
Fuck that.

2899
02:19:32,690 --> 02:19:34,220
Fuck that job.
Indeed.

2900
02:19:36,050 --> 02:19:38,290
Jobs insane.
It's insane.

2901
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:43,840
It's insane.
And being a cop and being a cop's 

2902
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:43,840
insane.
Saul.

2903
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:43,840
Insane.
Well,

2904
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:43,840
yeah.
Well,

2905
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:45,890
jobs are insane,
but you got to suck it back down to your

2906
02:19:45,891 --> 02:19:47,240
job.
Like where you're at,

2907
02:19:47,241 --> 02:19:48,110
man.
I mean that's the thing.

2908
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:52,280
Like my brain will go,
go in those directions so much,

2909
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:53,410
you know?
Uh.

2910
02:19:53,570 --> 02:19:55,900
Did you see Obama or here Obama on 
Marin?

2911
02:19:55,940 --> 02:19:57,950
I absolutely did.
I didn't hear it yet.

2912
02:19:58,430 --> 02:19:59,360
Good.
Oh,

2913
02:19:59,361 --> 02:20:00,530
that's a good interview,
man.

2914
02:20:00,531 --> 02:20:01,760
He did a great job,
man.

2915
02:20:01,761 --> 02:20:06,761
I was super.
One of my favorite part of the 

2916
02:20:06,761 --> 02:20:06,761
interview.
Uh,

2917
02:20:06,761 --> 02:20:10,210
one thing that happened,
I heard Marin on a bunch of interviews 

2918
02:20:10,210 --> 02:20:12,881
afterwards because everybody's like,
what the fuck is that like to get to 

2919
02:20:12,881 --> 02:20:17,350
interview the president?
And he was remarking on how Obama put 

2920
02:20:17,350 --> 02:20:21,491
him at ease,
like how Obama was really good at 

2921
02:20:21,491 --> 02:20:21,491
putting him at ease,
like it's his podcast,

2922
02:20:21,491 --> 02:20:23,960
but Obama,
just this master of like getting them to

2923
02:20:23,961 --> 02:20:27,320
relax and now so that he could do the 
interview and not be nervous because you

2924
02:20:27,321 --> 02:20:29,690
could hear him at the beginning,
just like most people,

2925
02:20:29,691 --> 02:20:34,691
he said he sounded a little nervous as 
you shouldn't use the fucking president 

2926
02:20:34,691 --> 02:20:34,691
were secret service.

2927
02:20:34,910 --> 02:20:37,370
Uh,
all over your goddamn house they have,

2928
02:20:37,550 --> 02:20:42,550
they had to block the window out with 
garbage bags because there was a sight 

2929
02:20:42,550 --> 02:20:44,030
line where there could have been a 
sniper on a roof.

2930
02:20:44,031 --> 02:20:46,460
There's a sniper on the roof of his 
fucking house.

2931
02:20:46,461 --> 02:20:48,560
Man in his intro,
he's like,

2932
02:20:48,561 --> 02:20:51,260
there's a sniper up my roof.
My neighbors hate me.

2933
02:20:51,261 --> 02:20:55,010
They shut off the whole street.
Like they came to his house,

2934
02:20:55,011 --> 02:20:55,880
you know,
it came.

2935
02:20:55,881 --> 02:21:00,881
Why did he do it as house?
What did he just do it at a place where 

2936
02:21:00,881 --> 02:21:01,190
they can secure it gets bad.
That's bad.

2937
02:21:01,191 --> 02:21:03,210
It's a bad ass decision because it's 
about us.

2938
02:21:03,290 --> 02:21:04,580
They must have been like,
you know,

2939
02:21:04,581 --> 02:21:06,830
that they were like,
do we have to do it at your house?

2940
02:21:06,831 --> 02:21:11,831
And he must've been like,
we're going to do it at my fucking 

2941
02:21:11,831 --> 02:21:11,831
house.
He did it.

2942
02:21:11,831 --> 02:21:11,831
He wore his flannel.

2943
02:21:11,831 --> 02:21:16,460
That was another bad decision.
Mark Marin Morris fucking flannel in the

2944
02:21:16,460 --> 02:21:17,300
United States.
No suit,

2945
02:21:17,540 --> 02:21:19,280
no change of attire.
That's,

2946
02:21:19,310 --> 02:21:20,960
that is his attire though.
That's his outfit.

2947
02:21:20,961 --> 02:21:22,670
Much like you're a bishop and I'm a NASA
guy.

2948
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:26,060
That's right.
I will think about what you said.

2949
02:21:26,061 --> 02:21:28,910
He wore his flannel so he puts his out 
sake.

2950
02:21:29,020 --> 02:21:31,940
You were like a grateful dead tee shirt 
or a fucking wife.

2951
02:21:31,941 --> 02:21:33,320
But a lot of people,
they're like,

2952
02:21:33,321 --> 02:21:35,150
I'm in the president,
I'm going to present to the president,

2953
02:21:35,151 --> 02:21:38,930
I'm going to wear a Tuxedo or whatever.
But that dresses in his normal attire.

2954
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:40,670
That was pretty cool.
And then,

2955
02:21:40,671 --> 02:21:43,370
um,
the interview itself was really great.

2956
02:21:43,371 --> 02:21:48,371
It was like,
it was like Obama was very funny and 

2957
02:21:48,371 --> 02:21:51,071
they were,
it was like they're great funny moments 

2958
02:21:51,071 --> 02:21:52,961
and that one of my favorite lines in the
interview was a Obama like mentions like

2959
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:57,860
Mark Marin mentions black helicopters 
and he's like,

2960
02:21:57,890 --> 02:21:59,490
but there's no black helicopters.
Right?

2961
02:21:59,910 --> 02:22:01,730
And Obama was like,
there are black helicopters,

2962
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:05,960
they just are in other countries more 
than we use them here.

2963
02:22:06,230 --> 02:22:07,790
But he did say they're black 
helicopters.

2964
02:22:07,791 --> 02:22:10,430
It's kind of everybody knows that I 
know.

2965
02:22:10,431 --> 02:22:15,431
But it was a funny thing for the 
president to hear it out of the 

2966
02:22:15,431 --> 02:22:15,431
president's mouth and it kind of funny 
way.

2967
02:22:15,431 --> 02:22:16,190
But again,
man,

2968
02:22:16,490 --> 02:22:21,490
you know,
outside of the how incredibly 

2969
02:22:21,490 --> 02:22:23,411
charismatic,
affable and how grateful I am to a lot 

2970
02:22:23,411 --> 02:22:25,140
of the shit the Obama administration has
done healthcare.

2971
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:25,980
And I know a lot

2972
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,930
of people out there fucking hate what 
he's done.

2973
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:33,200
But as somebody who has had cancer,
knowing that if I wanted to get 

2974
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:36,861
insurance,
if my insurance lapsed or something and 

2975
02:22:36,861 --> 02:22:37,470
they're not going to do what they 
usually do,

2976
02:22:37,471 --> 02:22:39,170
which is a uh,
uh,

2977
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:42,540
they would investigate you before you 
couldn't get insurance for days and days

2978
02:22:42,541 --> 02:22:47,541
and days.
They would investigate you to find out 

2979
02:22:47,541 --> 02:22:49,431
if you have previous health conditions 
and you couldn't get insurance so you'd 

2980
02:22:49,431 --> 02:22:49,431
have to,
like,

2981
02:22:49,431 --> 02:22:50,480
you could die or you get shitty 
healthcare.

2982
02:22:50,790 --> 02:22:55,790
Uh,
it's cool to know that a lot of people 

2983
02:22:55,790 --> 02:22:55,790
don't have to deal with that shit.
I think it's cool.

2984
02:22:55,790 --> 02:22:58,140
I know it's not a perfect system and 
from a libertarian perspective,

2985
02:22:58,141 --> 02:23:03,141
I,
I know a lot of you probably have good 

2986
02:23:03,141 --> 02:23:04,761
reasons to really hate it,
but I think there's a lot of good 

2987
02:23:04,761 --> 02:23:04,761
reasons to not hit it too.
So I'm grateful for that.

2988
02:23:04,761 --> 02:23:09,300
Marijuana seems to be becoming legal 
during his administration,

2989
02:23:09,301 --> 02:23:14,301
even though his administration has done 
a lot of shit to obstruct research on 

2990
02:23:14,551 --> 02:23:16,050
marijuana,
things seemed to be changing.

2991
02:23:16,410 --> 02:23:19,470
Gay Marriage is now legal.
That's under his administration.

2992
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:22,170
All those things.
The whistleblower stole that Shit.

2993
02:23:22,290 --> 02:23:23,910
See,
that's the shit that bugs me,

2994
02:23:23,911 --> 02:23:25,230
man.
And asked him about that.

2995
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:27,170
No,
I don't think so.

2996
02:23:27,171 --> 02:23:28,230
I didn't.
I actually,

2997
02:23:28,231 --> 02:23:28,920
I had to.
I didn't.

2998
02:23:28,921 --> 02:23:29,730
I was listening to you.

2999
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:35,200
Well,
I'll have to listen to it to see if he 

3000
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:36,701
did because that's super important 
subject and the idea that someone who's 

3001
02:23:37,761 --> 02:23:42,761
doing what they think is the right thing
for humanity by expressing they have a 

3002
02:23:43,491 --> 02:23:46,520
huge issue with the legality of certain 
actions that are,

3003
02:23:46,610 --> 02:23:49,430
that are commonplace.
It's fucked mean he seen,

3004
02:23:49,460 --> 02:23:54,460
he seen these things happen on a daily 
basis and he thinks they're 

3005
02:23:54,460 --> 02:23:55,010
unconstitutional and now he's hiding in 
Russia,

3006
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:57,150
man,
than how.

3007
02:23:57,420 --> 02:23:58,710
How crazy is that?
To me,

3008
02:23:58,711 --> 02:24:03,711
this is where you get into this problem 
with presidents were and they kind of 

3009
02:24:03,711 --> 02:24:05,520
remind you of like,
Oh fucking uncle,

3010
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:08,280
uncle Jack.
What a cool guy.

3011
02:24:08,281 --> 02:24:09,900
Right?
He's a super sweet guys.

3012
02:24:09,901 --> 02:24:11,940
Really awesome.
He's so fun.

3013
02:24:11,941 --> 02:24:15,060
The kids really love him.
Everybody likes Uncle Jack,

3014
02:24:16,050 --> 02:24:21,050
but there's a car jacker.
You'll either that or he's like 

3015
02:24:21,050 --> 02:24:23,130
molesting someone and you're supposed to
ignore the fact.

3016
02:24:23,131 --> 02:24:28,131
This is in families where I actually was
listening to this great documentary on 

3017
02:24:29,101 --> 02:24:34,101
npr about the phenomena of why that kind
of shit is sexual abuse will happen in a

3018
02:24:35,461 --> 02:24:40,461
family and keep happening in a family 
because to acknowledge it is to implode 

3019
02:24:41,041 --> 02:24:45,600
the family to acknowledge it is to that 
family is done and it happened.

3020
02:24:45,810 --> 02:24:47,030
This is when those.
I don't,

3021
02:24:47,031 --> 02:24:50,160
I don't even know.
I wasn't following the newest thing that

3022
02:24:50,161 --> 02:24:55,161
happened when that weird religious group
of people where there was sexual abuse 

3023
02:24:55,161 --> 02:24:55,161
that happened.

3024
02:24:55,161 --> 02:24:56,160
I can't even remember their names.
So it's in relation to that,

3025
02:24:56,161 --> 02:24:57,720
but the doers,
right?

3026
02:24:58,110 --> 02:25:01,500
So the Duggar's,
so you in a family,

3027
02:25:01,501 --> 02:25:03,420
if you like,
admit that this is happening,

3028
02:25:03,990 --> 02:25:05,820
father,
mother,

3029
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:07,710
uncle,
whoever is doing this thing,

3030
02:25:07,711 --> 02:25:10,440
you will transform the terrain of that 
family permanently.

3031
02:25:10,441 --> 02:25:12,000
Right?
So in the same way with,

3032
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:14,370
with the president,
you know,

3033
02:25:14,371 --> 02:25:19,371
it's,
we're almost being asked to do the same 

3034
02:25:19,371 --> 02:25:20,130
exact thing,
which is like take the good.

3035
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:23,920
He makes great hamburgers,
he gives the gate candy.

3036
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:26,860
He's like really fun.
He's got a slip and slide,

3037
02:25:27,070 --> 02:25:29,050
but for God's sake,
never mentioned the time.

3038
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:32,560
Two years ago when you were standing 
behind the tool shed,

3039
02:25:32,561 --> 02:25:35,440
he slid his finger into your asshole 
because if you do that,

3040
02:25:35,730 --> 02:25:40,730
it's fucking ruined our family in the 
same way we would with like that with 

3041
02:25:41,801 --> 02:25:42,700
Obama.
Man.

3042
02:25:42,730 --> 02:25:46,000
You're not supposed to you.
You just are like,

3043
02:25:46,001 --> 02:25:51,001
all right.
Just ignore the fact that right now 

3044
02:25:51,001 --> 02:25:54,001
we're dealing with for profit prisons.
One of the greatest heroes of our time,

3045
02:25:54,501 --> 02:25:59,501
snowden was a real patriot,
is having to hide in fucking Russia 

3046
02:25:59,891 --> 02:26:02,470
right now because we were supposed to 
ignore the fact.

3047
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:07,500
Even if Obama can't change it,
can he come out at a press conference 

3048
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:10,570
and say,
I support and endorse what snowden did.

3049
02:26:10,580 --> 02:26:10,770
Okay.
I

3050
02:26:10,810 --> 02:26:15,810
can't say that because then people will 
be able to just hack into anything they 

3051
02:26:15,810 --> 02:26:20,581
want and take information that the 
government has distributed all around 

3052
02:26:20,581 --> 02:26:23,110
the world and oh fuck up all sorts of 
counter terrorism activities.

3053
02:26:23,111 --> 02:26:28,111
They're doing fuck up all sorts of 
surveillance that they've got going on 

3054
02:26:28,111 --> 02:26:31,590
with real questionable people.
That might be some fucking isis 

3055
02:26:31,590 --> 02:26:31,590
character.
Yeah,

3056
02:26:31,590 --> 02:26:35,791
but I mean the whole you gotta you're 
supposed to like kind of devil's 

3057
02:26:35,791 --> 02:26:37,120
advocate buddy.
I know you are,

3058
02:26:37,121 --> 02:26:39,010
but and you literally are playing 
devil's advocate,

3059
02:26:39,011 --> 02:26:44,011
but I don't mean to.
I don't mean to like get all 

3060
02:26:44,011 --> 02:26:47,071
constitutional and everything,
but isn't the point of the president to 

3061
02:26:47,071 --> 02:26:51,750
uphold the constitution and isn't,
but I don't think the constitution 

3062
02:26:51,750 --> 02:26:56,050
existed when it was created with the 
understanding of the Internet,

3063
02:26:56,350 --> 02:26:58,540
with the understanding of the 
distribution of information,

3064
02:26:58,541 --> 02:27:00,700
with the understanding of covert 
intelligence,

3065
02:27:00,701 --> 02:27:05,701
with the understanding of terrorism,
with the understanding of a lot of 

3066
02:27:05,701 --> 02:27:05,701
things.

3067
02:27:05,701 --> 02:27:08,050
I think that was a real problem was that
first of all,

3068
02:27:08,051 --> 02:27:13,051
when,
when he did tell everybody that the NSA 

3069
02:27:13,051 --> 02:27:13,420
spying on every fucking American on the 
planet,

3070
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:15,290
they lied.
Right?

3071
02:27:15,430 --> 02:27:17,830
That's bad.
That's a huge problem.

3072
02:27:17,831 --> 02:27:20,140
That's one problem.
And second of all,

3073
02:27:20,141 --> 02:27:25,141
there's no rational justification.
There was no significant number of 

3074
02:27:25,141 --> 02:27:25,170
terrorism events.
They've.

3075
02:27:25,480 --> 02:27:29,800
They've stopped it while compromising 
the privacy of everybody.

3076
02:27:30,250 --> 02:27:35,250
Then they started talking about how I 
was just metadata and that wasn't true 

3077
02:27:35,250 --> 02:27:35,250
either.
It's not just metadata.

3078
02:27:35,250 --> 02:27:39,331
People were going into the the emails of
their ex boyfriends and girlfriends and 

3079
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:43,360
reading their shit and downloading 
pictures on their computers.

3080
02:27:43,510 --> 02:27:48,510
They're doing whatever the fuck they 
wanted to do and they can do whatever 

3081
02:27:48,510 --> 02:27:48,510
the fuck they want to do because they 
have this autonomy.

3082
02:27:48,510 --> 02:27:49,990
They have this power working for the 
NSA,

3083
02:27:49,991 --> 02:27:51,820
but what he was saying was like,
he was like,

3084
02:27:51,821 --> 02:27:56,821
I didn't even graduate from college,
and he goes and I have access to all 

3085
02:27:56,821 --> 02:27:57,820
this stuff and I'm just a normal person.
I'm around a bunch of other people.

3086
02:27:57,821 --> 02:27:59,590
Yeah,
and I got this information.

3087
02:27:59,591 --> 02:28:01,780
I leak.
I got this information out to people.

3088
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:04,540
What's the stop all these other people 
from taking information.

3089
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:09,840
What's to stop them from sharing it with
each other and passing it back and 

3090
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:09,840
forth?
Nothing.

3091
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:14,640
Nothing.
Obviously if he was he able to leak as 

3092
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:14,640
much as he leaked.
What?

3093
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:19,070
What?
What safeguards are in place for 

3094
02:28:19,070 --> 02:28:21,541
People's privacy?
Believe very little and whether or not 

3095
02:28:21,541 --> 02:28:22,040
you're doing anything wrong,
whether or not you need to

3096
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:24,110
worry about it,
that's not the argument.

3097
02:28:24,290 --> 02:28:29,290
The argument is it fundamentally changes
the relationship that you have with 

3098
02:28:29,290 --> 02:28:32,771
another person.
The same way being a cop changes the 

3099
02:28:32,771 --> 02:28:35,201
relationship.
When you're talking to someone that you 

3100
02:28:35,201 --> 02:28:35,480
think is committing a crime,
all of a sudden you have power over that

3101
02:28:35,481 --> 02:28:37,670
person's information.
They don't have any over.

3102
02:28:37,740 --> 02:28:40,310
You could say,
sit down,

3103
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:42,470
put your fucking hands over your head.
You'd be like,

3104
02:28:42,471 --> 02:28:43,160
no,
fuck you.

3105
02:28:43,161 --> 02:28:47,900
You sit down stupid fucking tumble and 
your role with your stupid uniform on.

3106
02:28:47,901 --> 02:28:52,901
Don't put a point a gun at me.
I need to sit down because you're 

3107
02:28:52,901 --> 02:28:55,331
pointing a gun at me.
You're an asshole or you need to put 

3108
02:28:55,331 --> 02:28:58,661
your hands behind your back.
I'm going to handcuff you because I 

3109
02:28:58,661 --> 02:28:58,661
don't trust you pointing a gun at me.
Pay Your bills,

3110
02:28:58,661 --> 02:29:02,951
dude.
I pay your bills and you're pointing a 

3111
02:29:02,951 --> 02:29:02,951
gun at me or my daughter.

3112
02:29:02,951 --> 02:29:02,951
Right,
but no one is going to accept that.

3113
02:29:02,951 --> 02:29:03,830
No one's going to accept that you're not
gonna.

3114
02:29:03,831 --> 02:29:08,420
Accept that because a cop thinks he's a 
cop and it's similar in a lot of ways.

3115
02:29:08,750 --> 02:29:13,750
It's similar.
The idea that someone has access to 

3116
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:13,750
Duncan trussell's email,
but you don't have access to.

3117
02:29:13,750 --> 02:29:18,131
There's no.
You don't even know they're there 

3118
02:29:18,131 --> 02:29:20,080
checking in on you.
They have power over you and observing 

3119
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:20,080
you,
making sure you don't fuck up.

3120
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:21,260
Guess what?
Just like how,

3121
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:22,670
when you're talking about those,
uh,

3122
02:29:22,671 --> 02:29:27,671
those experiments that they do on 
subatomic particles and waves and other 

3123
02:29:27,671 --> 02:29:29,450
quantum shit with the observer changes 
the effect.

3124
02:29:29,990 --> 02:29:34,990
Guess what?
When you fucking follow someone around 

3125
02:29:34,990 --> 02:29:34,990
and observed the shit out of 'em,
uh,

3126
02:29:34,990 --> 02:29:38,711
changes them and changes them similar to
that stupid double blind double slit 

3127
02:29:39,561 --> 02:29:42,650
experiment.
It's a wave and it's a particle.

3128
02:29:42,770 --> 02:29:45,030
You're innocent,
but you're also a criminal for diff.

3129
02:29:45,530 --> 02:29:48,230
Constantly following you trying to look 
yet changes.

3130
02:29:48,231 --> 02:29:53,231
You fucking changes the way you feel if 
someone's hounding you and fucking with 

3131
02:29:53,231 --> 02:29:53,570
you.
It changes you.

3132
02:29:54,090 --> 02:29:54,980
Yeah,
man,

3133
02:29:55,220 --> 02:29:56,120
it's.
Yeah,

3134
02:29:56,121 --> 02:29:57,200
that didn't,
you know,

3135
02:29:57,201 --> 02:29:58,520
that's the thing.
It's like,

3136
02:29:58,700 --> 02:30:01,540
it's such a confused.
It's such a confusing thing to hear.

3137
02:30:01,570 --> 02:30:03,530
I mean,
I hear such an affable,

3138
02:30:03,531 --> 02:30:08,531
cool guy,
done some really great things and to 

3139
02:30:08,531 --> 02:30:10,070
know that this other shit is going on.
It's just kinda sad man.

3140
02:30:10,071 --> 02:30:12,020
It'd be so beautiful if,
uh,

3141
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:13,950
you know,
he,

3142
02:30:14,110 --> 02:30:17,030
he had actually shut down Guantanamo,
like the,

3143
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:18,260
the,
uh,

3144
02:30:18,380 --> 02:30:22,420
staff coming back about either treating 
those poor bastards like raw,

3145
02:30:22,550 --> 02:30:27,550
you know,
they're just like force feeding them 

3146
02:30:27,550 --> 02:30:27,550
even though they want to die so they're 
not even letting them die.

3147
02:30:27,550 --> 02:30:30,810
They're keeping them alive like 
something from the hellraiser dimension,

3148
02:30:30,840 --> 02:30:35,570
just shoving tubes into their throat and
putting protein gel into their bellies.

3149
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:40,840
And a lot of these guys,
I'm sure some of them are not great 

3150
02:30:40,840 --> 02:30:41,780
people,
but I think a lot of them are probably,

3151
02:30:42,020 --> 02:30:43,820
they haven't even been given a trial.
You know,

3152
02:30:43,930 --> 02:30:48,350
there's a lot of them that got 
interested in alternative ways to govern

3153
02:30:48,351 --> 02:30:53,351
and live lives and alternative 
philosophies and religions and our 

3154
02:30:53,351 --> 02:30:57,710
alternative ideologies and maybe even 
militant ideologies that were curious.

3155
02:30:57,740 --> 02:31:02,740
They were curious about.
It doesn't mean that they've committed 

3156
02:31:02,740 --> 02:31:02,740
any crimes.
Doesn't mean that they've.

3157
02:31:02,740 --> 02:31:03,620
I mean they might be,
but they might not be.

3158
02:31:03,980 --> 02:31:08,980
But the idea that all you have to do is 
just be interested in these things and 

3159
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:11,030
they can lock you out a lock you up.
That's there's a thought crime aspect to

3160
02:31:11,031 --> 02:31:12,050
that.
That's really scary.

3161
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:13,220
We got to hold.
The thing is,

3162
02:31:13,250 --> 02:31:14,630
God,
this sounds so cliche,

3163
02:31:14,631 --> 02:31:16,640
but you gotta hold your leaders 
accountable.

3164
02:31:16,641 --> 02:31:19,710
You must hold leaders accountable and we
haven't doing it.

3165
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:20,070
It

3166
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:22,530
doesn't happen and because it doesn't 
happen,

3167
02:31:22,770 --> 02:31:26,610
they keep taking more liberties and the 
problem is we don't know how to hold our

3168
02:31:26,611 --> 02:31:29,130
leaders accountable because they're in 
charge of everything.

3169
02:31:29,131 --> 02:31:34,131
So that's the predicament outside of 
holding them accountable by voting or 

3170
02:31:34,131 --> 02:31:34,200
hold the,
you know,

3171
02:31:34,201 --> 02:31:37,470
that's one way to do it,
but it's a really confusing,

3172
02:31:37,770 --> 02:31:38,310
you know,
again,

3173
02:31:38,311 --> 02:31:40,710
and again,
you hear the term war criminal thrown in

3174
02:31:40,711 --> 02:31:44,550
the direction of the Bush administration
and you know,

3175
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:49,600
I don't know if it's true or not,
but I know there's never going to be a 

3176
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:52,371
trial.
I know that there's never going to be 

3177
02:31:52,371 --> 02:31:52,371
any,
anything,

3178
02:31:52,371 --> 02:31:55,611
even close to a real investigation into 
why we went to war there and what we did

3179
02:31:56,761 --> 02:32:01,761
while we were there and all that shit 
just kind of gets swept down the river 

3180
02:32:01,761 --> 02:32:05,961
of history and you're invited to ignore 
it and look in the direction of the 

3181
02:32:06,180 --> 02:32:08,820
progressive things that are happening 
and they're great,

3182
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:14,060
but then because great things are 
happening does not mean that you ignore 

3183
02:32:14,191 --> 02:32:19,191
all the other dark shit that's happening
and it doesn't mean that you're being a 

3184
02:32:19,191 --> 02:32:22,371
conspiracy theorist or negative or 
pessimistic because you won't let go of 

3185
02:32:23,041 --> 02:32:28,041
the fact that the last few presidents 
who've maybe done some shit that is,

3186
02:32:29,460 --> 02:32:34,460
seems to go directly against the rules 
that were written down and whatever this

3187
02:32:34,630 --> 02:32:36,900
current game of being an American is.

3188
02:32:37,170 --> 02:32:40,020
And everybody's got to be held to those 
rules.

3189
02:32:40,021 --> 02:32:44,250
If everyone's not held to those rules,
then we're all supposed to either wander

3190
02:32:44,251 --> 02:32:48,780
around in a state of denial and pretend 
that everything's cool and it isn't.

3191
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:50,850
Or we have to like,
I don't know.

3192
02:32:50,851 --> 02:32:51,090
What

3193
02:32:51,350 --> 02:32:52,250
did you hear about this?
Uh,

3194
02:32:52,320 --> 02:32:54,350
there's a great article that I tweeted 
yesterday,

3195
02:32:54,351 --> 02:32:58,970
Isis and the lonely young American,
it's about this girl who's a 23 year old

3196
02:32:59,180 --> 02:33:03,620
Sunday school teacher and a babysitter 
and she was a,

3197
02:33:03,650 --> 02:33:06,320
she converted to Islam.
She was lonely.

3198
02:33:06,350 --> 02:33:11,350
She was living with her grandparents.
She converted to Islam and it goes over 

3199
02:33:11,350 --> 02:33:14,291
this long slow sort of story where it's 
just like you,

3200
02:33:14,711 --> 02:33:19,711
you understand like who she is and how 
she got sucked in and she fucking joins 

3201
02:33:19,711 --> 02:33:21,650
isis.
Isis like offers her like some,

3202
02:33:21,740 --> 02:33:26,740
some feeling of belonging and she,
she goes through this process to join 

3203
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:27,770
isis.
I don't want to tell you any more of it.

3204
02:33:27,771 --> 02:33:30,600
I just want people to read it because 
it's really fascinating and it's,

3205
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:34,280
it's.
It also highlights an aspect of adhering

3206
02:33:34,281 --> 02:33:39,281
to ideologies that a lot of people don't
want to admit is that people are 

3207
02:33:39,281 --> 02:33:39,920
extremely vulnerable because we don't 
want to be alone.

3208
02:33:40,310 --> 02:33:45,310
And a lot of times when you see someone 
who is absolutely committed to 

3209
02:33:45,310 --> 02:33:45,310
something,
whether.

3210
02:33:45,310 --> 02:33:49,661
I mean,
how many times did people like seeing 

3211
02:33:49,661 --> 02:33:51,761
that Bob Ross guy committing to painting
and they wanted to become a painter 

3212
02:33:51,761 --> 02:33:53,130
because it's attractive when you see 
someone who's into something you want to

3213
02:33:53,150 --> 02:33:55,250
Julia Child Cook or Anthony Bourdain 
Cook,

3214
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:57,840
you want to cook like God damn,
I don't want to cook too.

3215
02:33:58,070 --> 02:33:59,280
How's exciting?
Well,

3216
02:33:59,330 --> 02:34:03,590
when you see someone who's like really 
into being a Muslim or really into being

3217
02:34:03,680 --> 02:34:05,750
a Buddhist or really into being a lot of
things,

3218
02:34:06,140 --> 02:34:09,950
you get sucked into it.
The archetype of like the Yogi,

3219
02:34:10,100 --> 02:34:13,460
like the people that are like that fake 
bullshit sot nom you know,

3220
02:34:13,461 --> 02:34:14,960
no mas De,
you know those guys.

3221
02:34:14,990 --> 02:34:19,990
It was like an archetype that they sort 
of follow into and they fall into it 

3222
02:34:19,990 --> 02:34:21,280
because when you see it,
it looks like super attractive.

3223
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:21,940
Like,
Oh wow,

3224
02:34:21,941 --> 02:34:24,340
that is like really spiritual.
I want to be like him.

3225
02:34:24,720 --> 02:34:26,380
Well,
there's people that are like that.

3226
02:34:26,381 --> 02:34:31,381
They're alone and they're sad and 
they're vulnerable and being a Muslim 

3227
02:34:31,381 --> 02:34:33,790
looks like a good idea to them.
Or being a Mormon looks like a good idea

3228
02:34:33,791 --> 02:34:38,791
to them being in in some sort of a group
that accepts you and pulls you in the 

3229
02:34:38,791 --> 02:34:41,940
zero.
They're giving you interaction and 

3230
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:41,940
that's this.
This story is really fascinating because

3231
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:46,590
it's something that I've always felt 
compelled by because I felt minorly 

3232
02:34:46,590 --> 02:34:50,431
compelled by all sorts of different 
religions in my life will like I will 

3233
02:34:50,431 --> 02:34:54,391
watch like even speeches are radical 
Islamic speeches when these guys are 

3234
02:34:54,391 --> 02:34:58,711
talking in front of these people,
in other parts of the world that speak 

3235
02:34:58,711 --> 02:35:00,100
English,
but they're giant populations of them,

3236
02:35:00,370 --> 02:35:04,480
but there's something attractive even 
though he's saying nobody shit about.

3237
02:35:04,940 --> 02:35:09,940
It says in the Koran,
you're supposed to stone adulterers and 

3238
02:35:09,940 --> 02:35:10,560
it says in the Koran,
but they're good going over like,

3239
02:35:10,570 --> 02:35:15,570
how could you?
How could you possibly know better than 

3240
02:35:15,570 --> 02:35:15,570
God?
This is the.

3241
02:35:15,570 --> 02:35:19,760
Is this not the greatest answer to this 
problem that God has provided and 

3242
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:20,350
everyone will clap.
He goes,

3243
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:23,410
thank you.
Then exactly like this is Islam,

3244
02:35:23,411 --> 02:35:28,411
and he was going on and that was like 
the confidence that this guy has and 

3245
02:35:28,411 --> 02:35:28,930
what he's saying becomes attractive even
to me.

3246
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:30,160
Even to me,
okay,

3247
02:35:30,161 --> 02:35:34,390
I'm nowhere near joining Islam.
I'm nowhere near joining Isis.

3248
02:35:34,391 --> 02:35:37,350
I'm nowhere near becoming a mormon.
I'm becoming a scientologist,

3249
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:39,100
but you know what I'm saying?
Man,

3250
02:35:39,101 --> 02:35:41,650
I'm watching this,
but I feel the draw.

3251
02:35:41,800 --> 02:35:45,370
Everyone feels a little bit because the 
guy is,

3252
02:35:45,820 --> 02:35:48,910
he's compelling and and a lot of them 
are religious people.

3253
02:35:48,911 --> 02:35:53,911
People that believe in wholeheartedly in
everything that they're saying and they 

3254
02:35:53,911 --> 02:35:55,120
have charisma and they have passion 
behind it.

3255
02:35:55,160 --> 02:36:00,160
Like I don't have those things.
I want to be like him because I feel 

3256
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:02,020
like he's giving off positive,
strong energy and if he's right,

3257
02:36:02,350 --> 02:36:07,350
if he's right about God and God really 
is on the side of the righteous and he 

3258
02:36:07,350 --> 02:36:10,570
will lead us towards God damn.
Guys seem super convinced.

3259
02:36:10,571 --> 02:36:13,000
I'm not convinced of anything like that,
but you get drawn into it.

3260
02:36:13,030 --> 02:36:18,030
I think one thing that you're 
overlooking is the idea that I was at 

3261
02:36:19,571 --> 02:36:20,920
sheldrake.
He talks about,

3262
02:36:21,130 --> 02:36:26,130
I think he used the term ease is the 
term Murrano how like certain belief 

3263
02:36:26,130 --> 02:36:28,630
systems create Ronald's and the time 
space continuum or like they.

3264
02:36:28,740 --> 02:36:33,740
It kind of like like you know,
like in Conan when he's walking around 

3265
02:36:33,740 --> 02:36:37,471
in the wheel,
the wheel and it he like he did like 

3266
02:36:37,471 --> 02:36:40,681
from walking around so many times.
There's actually like a trench that he 

3267
02:36:40,681 --> 02:36:41,680
takes out.
His groove comes to,

3268
02:36:41,681 --> 02:36:46,681
exist in the universe and those grooves 
are the major world religions and so you

3269
02:36:47,041 --> 02:36:52,041
know right now,
not only are people shitting and float 

3270
02:36:52,041 --> 02:36:52,120
tanks,
but right now at this very moment,

3271
02:36:52,450 --> 02:36:57,450
people and mosques in great numbers all 
across the planet or intoning these very

3272
02:36:58,571 --> 02:37:03,571
sacred words that come from a mystical 
book and they're singing them and that 

3273
02:37:04,751 --> 02:37:08,650
creates a resonance that you can tune 
into at anytime that you want to.

3274
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:11,590
And that's the poll that I believe 
you're feeling.

3275
02:37:11,591 --> 02:37:15,710
It's more than just I want to fit in or 
I want to be a disciplined person.

3276
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:21,130
It's like you start by dipping your toe 
in this river of subjective universe,

3277
02:37:22,281 --> 02:37:27,281
which is whatever religion it is that 
you're exploring and then you stick in 

3278
02:37:27,281 --> 02:37:30,221
your foot and then you stick in your 
other foot and the next thing you know 

3279
02:37:30,221 --> 02:37:33,791
that motherfucker will suck you in and 
we'll pull you into the into that 

3280
02:37:35,121 --> 02:37:40,121
particular dance that a group of people 
are doing and it's a very beautiful 

3281
02:37:40,641 --> 02:37:45,641
dance to beautiful thing to watch.
We've talked about this a million times 

3282
02:37:45,641 --> 02:37:49,211
before,
but when you're watching that and 

3283
02:37:49,211 --> 02:37:51,850
credible drift of pilgrims is they're 
moving around that.

3284
02:37:51,981 --> 02:37:54,350
What's the name of the cop that.
What's it called?

3285
02:37:54,351 --> 02:37:55,940
The Kaaba Makkah,
but it's called.

3286
02:37:56,070 --> 02:38:01,070
I don't know what it's called,
but I know we're talking about and it's 

3287
02:38:01,070 --> 02:38:03,071
got a media right in it and his 
beautiful surging ocean of people 

3288
02:38:03,071 --> 02:38:07,271
dressed in white or like touching the 
stone and it's incredible to watch and 

3289
02:38:07,271 --> 02:38:08,660
it's really does help me to write in it.
Right?

3290
02:38:08,870 --> 02:38:10,450
I think it's immediate.
It's a black state.

3291
02:38:10,451 --> 02:38:15,451
I think it's a media.
It's a blackstone hold us up and it's 

3292
02:38:15,451 --> 02:38:18,881
rundown from other fingers touching them
and if you think all those people in 

3293
02:38:18,881 --> 02:38:22,580
that swirl of humanity or isis level,
fundamentalist lunatic assholes,

3294
02:38:22,581 --> 02:38:27,581
you're just tricking yourself because 
you want the universe to be black and 

3295
02:38:27,581 --> 02:38:30,611
white and it's not.
A lot of those people are really very 

3296
02:38:30,611 --> 02:38:34,001
advanced beings who have just been drawn
into the particular way that the 

3297
02:38:34,001 --> 02:38:34,130
universe expresses itself.

3298
02:38:34,590 --> 02:38:39,590
This is not to be trusted because it's 
one of those World News daily report.

3299
02:38:40,001 --> 02:38:41,270
Dr.
Trusted.

3300
02:38:41,740 --> 02:38:43,420
What did they say?
It is Saudi Arabia.

3301
02:38:43,421 --> 02:38:48,421
Blackstone of Mecca.
Blackstone of Mecca revealed to be a 

3302
02:38:48,421 --> 02:38:48,421
media.
Right.

3303
02:38:48,421 --> 02:38:50,650
It's a real problem with that.
Websites were printed though.

3304
02:38:50,740 --> 02:38:52,420
I mean,
I don't know what it is.

3305
02:38:52,421 --> 02:38:54,190
It's.
It's price.

3306
02:38:54,191 --> 02:38:55,870
Something weird though.
Media,

3307
02:38:55,871 --> 02:38:57,100
right.
Worship of the blocks down.

3308
02:38:57,101 --> 02:38:59,180
There's more than one website that says 
that.

3309
02:38:59,240 --> 02:39:03,490
I'm got to go to wikipedia and look up.
Blacks done for some reason.

3310
02:39:03,491 --> 02:39:06,670
Wikipedia Islam's media at the circle.
At the Kaaba.

3311
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:07,810
The Kaaba.
Yeah,

3312
02:39:07,811 --> 02:39:10,990
that's what it's called.
I'm googling it right in front of her.

3313
02:39:12,030 --> 02:39:13,430
Page two.
It says worship.

3314
02:39:13,460 --> 02:39:18,460
It's not what worship are Muslims,
but it is a media right inside that 

3315
02:39:18,460 --> 02:39:20,420
thing though the Capa stone,
but it is.

3316
02:39:20,421 --> 02:39:25,421
Right.
So even if it's not worshiped by 

3317
02:39:25,421 --> 02:39:27,641
Muslims,
it's at the center of their worship 

3318
02:39:27,641 --> 02:39:27,680
spot.
I think that's probably significant.

3319
02:39:28,270 --> 02:39:30,820
Yeah,
that's pretty crazy.

3320
02:39:30,970 --> 02:39:32,920
But you know,
and the other black stone,

3321
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:37,120
do you ever play as it is that it right.
There isn't the only image of blackstone

3322
02:39:37,150 --> 02:39:42,150
or hygiene.
Oral as swabbed is the eastern corner 

3323
02:39:42,150 --> 02:39:43,750
stone of the Kaaba that the agent still 
building,

3324
02:39:43,751 --> 02:39:45,910
located in the center of the Grand 
Mosque in Mecca.

3325
02:39:45,970 --> 02:39:49,180
It is revered by Muslims is an Islamic 
relic,

3326
02:39:49,181 --> 02:39:53,320
which according to Muslim tradition 
dates back to the time of Adam and eve.

3327
02:39:53,490 --> 02:39:58,490
Dude,
go to the Google image search and you 

3328
02:39:58,490 --> 02:39:59,810
can see the actual thing.
It looks like a vagina.

3329
02:40:00,070 --> 02:40:04,730
It's like the vagina of the universe.
Could imagine if that was like that.

3330
02:40:04,731 --> 02:40:08,770
Literally is the vagina of the universe 
more like

3331
02:40:08,770 --> 02:40:10,420
a belly button.
Oh yeah.

3332
02:40:10,421 --> 02:40:14,290
It does have a kind of very vaginal wow.
The region

3333
02:40:14,310 --> 02:40:17,310
there and touching the vagina of the 
universe.

3334
02:40:18,650 --> 02:40:20,990
Well,
I mean if that was a media right.

3335
02:40:21,380 --> 02:40:26,380
Okay,
and that means it came crashing down to 

3336
02:40:26,380 --> 02:40:27,530
earth from the Schuylkill,
smoothly touching it.

3337
02:40:28,920 --> 02:40:30,770
I don't know where you've been buying 
your walnuts.

3338
02:40:30,771 --> 02:40:33,340
I can go to a new place.
Looks like a dragon egg.

3339
02:40:33,950 --> 02:40:35,370
It looks like a vagina.
Goddamn man.

3340
02:40:35,371 --> 02:40:37,100
It's a dragon egg.
It's a vagina.

3341
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:41,810
So if you think about it,
birth life came out of impact.

3342
02:40:41,811 --> 02:40:45,950
If it wasn't for the impact of comments,
we wouldn't have water apparently.

3343
02:40:46,010 --> 02:40:49,610
Is that true?
I believe that water came from comments.

3344
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:52,130
I've heard that.
I don't know if they know that for sure,

3345
02:40:52,370 --> 02:40:55,340
but we do know for sure that if it 
wasn't for the meteor impact that killed

3346
02:40:55,341 --> 02:40:56,840
the dinosaurs,
we'd be fucked.

3347
02:40:57,170 --> 02:40:58,980
We would not have made it.
Okay.

3348
02:40:59,300 --> 02:41:04,300
We've got neat and everywhere you look,
giant fucking dinosaurs have a loss of 

3349
02:41:04,300 --> 02:41:05,030
raptors t rexes.

3350
02:41:05,210 --> 02:41:07,510
You never figured out the airplane.
If there was terra data,

3351
02:41:07,830 --> 02:41:11,680
you are taking too much time.
You fly around a jackie would eat you.

3352
02:41:11,690 --> 02:41:12,320
You'd be like,
fuck,

3353
02:41:12,321 --> 02:41:14,720
we can't fly yet.
We gotta kill all the carryback dose and

3354
02:41:14,721 --> 02:41:17,120
that you'd never get to them because you
can't fly.

3355
02:41:17,210 --> 02:41:19,610
So how are you going to get to them?
You'd have to get to the point where you

3356
02:41:19,611 --> 02:41:24,611
invented the the jet,
like a fighter jet where there was no 

3357
02:41:24,611 --> 02:41:26,120
Tara Dac dolls.
That was the only way,

3358
02:41:26,121 --> 02:41:28,010
and then you have to fly over to where 
the fuck they are.

3359
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:30,390
Make sure you have a big tank of gas and
Jack All.

3360
02:41:30,400 --> 02:41:32,960
Make sure you kill all of them.
Then you can spread air travel.

3361
02:41:33,190 --> 02:41:38,190
Imagine if you had to try and sell 
tickets for American Airlines and you 

3362
02:41:38,190 --> 02:41:39,260
might get taken out by Tara dactyl the 
fuck out of here.

3363
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:44,440
No one's going to fly anywhere.
Most people wouldn't even fly on an 

3364
02:41:44,440 --> 02:41:44,600
airline that has a last name.
Asia,

3365
02:41:44,660 --> 02:41:45,590
right?
At this point,

3366
02:41:45,591 --> 02:41:47,870
people are terrified about things drop 
into the ocean.

3367
02:41:48,260 --> 02:41:51,290
If there was tared axles in the event of
a pterodactyl attack,

3368
02:41:51,291 --> 02:41:55,640
do not panic.
The key is to look like an egg.

3369
02:41:56,630 --> 02:41:59,150
They can't see very well.
The only they don't move.

3370
02:41:59,151 --> 02:42:03,470
They use egg edge detection in the very 
unlikely event of a pterodactyl attack.

3371
02:42:03,740 --> 02:42:04,340
It's like,
well,

3372
02:42:04,341 --> 02:42:09,341
I feel.
I feel like that when I go swimming in 

3373
02:42:09,341 --> 02:42:09,341
the ocean.
It's like,

3374
02:42:09,341 --> 02:42:09,341
you know,
sharks are the terra data.

3375
02:42:09,341 --> 02:42:14,090
How's that see there?
These ancient to mouth that are just 

3376
02:42:14,090 --> 02:42:15,320
monsters grow.
Yeah.

3377
02:42:15,321 --> 02:42:20,321
That one in North Carolina,
like jaws is happening in North 

3378
02:42:20,321 --> 02:42:20,321
Carolina.
Well,

3379
02:42:20,321 --> 02:42:22,940
how about two people got their arms cut 
off inside of the day.

3380
02:42:23,180 --> 02:42:25,690
She's two people an hour apart from each
other.

3381
02:42:25,730 --> 02:42:29,030
Cut Their fucking arms bitten off.
First of all.

3382
02:42:29,031 --> 02:42:34,031
That second dude,
did he know about the first two because 

3383
02:42:34,031 --> 02:42:35,060
that changes everything for a second.
Dude knew about the first dude in new.

3384
02:42:35,061 --> 02:42:37,000
They didn't catch the shark yet.
He's probably like,

3385
02:42:37,010 --> 02:42:42,010
well fuck man is full now.
Swimming in Hawaii when there's shark 

3386
02:42:42,010 --> 02:42:42,480
attacks,
you know,

3387
02:42:42,830 --> 02:42:45,680
on Maui and we were there.
So many d I e deed.

3388
02:42:47,050 --> 02:42:50,740
Sure the kids are listening.
Oh my God.

3389
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:51,580
Yeah.
We had to tell.

3390
02:42:51,620 --> 02:42:54,160
We haven't talked about that.
That did happen when I was there.

3391
02:42:54,250 --> 02:42:55,630
Dude happens all the time.
Yeah,

3392
02:42:55,631 --> 02:42:57,040
sure happens.
Yeah.

3393
02:42:57,640 --> 02:42:59,980
They like to keep that shit on the DL.
You know,

3394
02:42:59,981 --> 02:43:01,120
they'll talk about on the news out 
there,

3395
02:43:01,121 --> 02:43:03,370
but the people on the island,
they're not scared.

3396
02:43:03,700 --> 02:43:04,390
You know?
I mean,

3397
02:43:04,391 --> 02:43:05,560
they just,
that's just life.

3398
02:43:05,770 --> 02:43:06,440
That's,
that's the,

3399
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:08,860
the life that they live,
they don't want to get eaten by sharks,

3400
02:43:08,861 --> 02:43:11,980
but when I was there one time I was 
there and someone and another

3401
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:13,500
time I was there and there was a news 
report.

3402
02:43:13,540 --> 02:43:15,280
Totally different time where this dude 
got jacked.

3403
02:43:15,550 --> 02:43:17,150
He was fucked up.
He was in the hospital,

3404
02:43:17,151 --> 02:43:21,340
his leg was fucking eating apart and he 
was just talking about what it felt like

3405
02:43:21,341 --> 02:43:23,020
and I was friend rescued him and then 
the whole,

3406
02:43:23,370 --> 02:43:28,370
this is a regular occurrence.
I'm talking about two separate trips to 

3407
02:43:28,370 --> 02:43:30,070
Hawaii to fucking shark attacks.
Both took place while I was there.

3408
02:43:30,760 --> 02:43:34,900
I was a little buzzed and almost fell 
down a volcano inside.

3409
02:43:34,930 --> 02:43:37,400
Well not inside,
but like on the far side of it,

3410
02:43:37,401 --> 02:43:42,401
like because there's a fucking damn this
beautiful observation place where you 

3411
02:43:42,401 --> 02:43:43,890
could look at a volcano and yeah man,
I.

3412
02:43:43,900 --> 02:43:47,650
There was a bar and I vote who I like 
had a couple of Margarita is.

3413
02:43:47,651 --> 02:43:49,360
And then we were standing out there and 
like I,

3414
02:43:49,361 --> 02:43:54,361
I kinda stumbled for a second and 
realize I could've just gone sliding 

3415
02:43:54,361 --> 02:43:54,361
down volcanic rock.

3416
02:43:54,390 --> 02:43:57,850
It wouldn't have been into lava.
Which will be a glorious way to die.

3417
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:03,000
No,
you would have broken your legs and 

3418
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,150
starve to death and you'd be on like 
18th youtube videos,

3419
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:09,630
especially if you have a Gopro gopro 
video of the dude who was on the 

3420
02:44:09,630 --> 02:44:11,320
motorcycle got hit by a truck.
Now you haven't seen it.

3421
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:12,940
You saw it.
Does he die?

3422
02:44:12,970 --> 02:44:14,370
Brian showed it to me the other night.
Um,

3423
02:44:14,530 --> 02:44:15,970
no.
He might as well be dead though.

3424
02:44:16,060 --> 02:44:21,060
He's just fucked beyond repair.
This is going fast and he hit on 

3425
02:44:21,060 --> 02:44:22,380
collides with the truck.
God dammit.

3426
02:44:22,450 --> 02:44:23,410
Dude,
that sucks.

3427
02:44:23,750 --> 02:44:25,600
Woo.
It's crazy to watch.

3428
02:44:25,780 --> 02:44:26,830
Do you want to watch it?
Okay.

3429
02:44:28,750 --> 02:44:30,850
Let's see.
Let's add this to the beaker.

3430
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:32,880
Goddammit.
This the tough.

3431
02:44:36,870 --> 02:44:40,300
Are you fucking kidding me dude?
I mean,

3432
02:44:40,301 --> 02:44:43,740
this is a fucking madness.
Uploaded the video he must have.

3433
02:44:44,920 --> 02:44:46,570
So he's okay.
I don't know.

3434
02:44:46,571 --> 02:44:49,840
I mean someone else picks up the Gopro 
and starts filming him.

3435
02:44:49,900 --> 02:44:51,750
He's good enough to upload videos.
No,

3436
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:52,100
no,
no,

3437
02:44:52,101 --> 02:44:52,320
no,
no.

3438
02:44:52,330 --> 02:44:55,120
Someone else picks up the Gopro,
but like,

3439
02:44:55,630 --> 02:44:56,970
stop.
I can't watch this anymore.

3440
02:44:57,350 --> 02:45:01,780
You can't play more than two times.
Well,

3441
02:45:01,810 --> 02:45:04,270
I hope he's doing okay now.
He's much better.

3442
02:45:04,600 --> 02:45:07,280
He might have.
He has nationwide need home insurance.

3443
02:45:07,570 --> 02:45:08,830
Geico.
Which ones?

3444
02:45:08,831 --> 02:45:13,831
Cars.
I'm a saying in my hands are sweating 

3445
02:45:13,831 --> 02:45:15,010
from watching that.
Like feel.

3446
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:17,440
Feel my hand right now.
Feel Jesus Christ.

3447
02:45:17,441 --> 02:45:18,400
Yeah,
I'm soaked.

3448
02:45:18,401 --> 02:45:22,090
Hyperhidrosis.
What does that sweaty lets me,

3449
02:45:22,180 --> 02:45:23,580
dude.
I'm hyperhidrosis.

3450
02:45:23,820 --> 02:45:25,870
Hyperhidrosis.
The Myth of height.

3451
02:45:26,050 --> 02:45:28,300
Hyperhidrosis.
Yeah.

3452
02:45:28,301 --> 02:45:30,430
I get nervous anytime I get nervous.
My hands sweat.

3453
02:45:30,431 --> 02:45:35,431
Like crazy guy.
Mind to my body just thinks like you 

3454
02:45:35,531 --> 02:45:36,220
better run.

3455
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:38,440
Run like no,
we're just about to take a test.

3456
02:45:38,780 --> 02:45:40,120
No fucking run.
Dude.

3457
02:45:40,180 --> 02:45:41,320
Fucking run.
No,

3458
02:45:41,321 --> 02:45:41,560
no,
no,

3459
02:45:41,561 --> 02:45:41,740
no,
no.

3460
02:45:41,741 --> 02:45:43,630
We're just watching a youtube video.
No,

3461
02:45:43,720 --> 02:45:45,250
no.
The fucking truck is coming.

3462
02:45:46,150 --> 02:45:51,150
Fucking run.
I see the bike going towards the truck 

3463
02:45:51,150 --> 02:45:52,960
and my hands start sweating like they 
have to just run away somehow.

3464
02:45:53,230 --> 02:45:54,310
I don't know what's going on with your 
body.

3465
02:45:54,311 --> 02:45:56,310
Like heating up.
Like it thinks it's a.

3466
02:45:56,311 --> 02:45:58,060
it's preparing to burst.
I don't know.

3467
02:45:58,110 --> 02:46:00,910
It's a great question because it doesn't
seem like it's going to help like sweaty

3468
02:46:00,911 --> 02:46:02,050
palms.
It's like worse.

3469
02:46:02,051 --> 02:46:04,900
If you want to grab onto something,
it's going to be harder to do it.

3470
02:46:04,901 --> 02:46:06,280
It seems weird.
I don't worst.

3471
02:46:07,010 --> 02:46:08,980
It's not good for anything.
Yeah.

3472
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:10,060
Your.
Your grip gets

3473
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:15,070
slippery for a pool.
It's like it was always a plague of 

3474
02:46:15,070 --> 02:46:16,360
mine.
I used to actually spray anti perspirant

3475
02:46:16,370 --> 02:46:17,980
I'm a hands.
Oh Wow.

3476
02:46:18,020 --> 02:46:19,490
Yeah,
and then I found this stuff called.

3477
02:46:19,610 --> 02:46:24,610
It's called like hands dry or dry hands 
or something like that.

3478
02:46:25,010 --> 02:46:30,010
It's essentially like antiperspirant for
people that have a problem with the 

3479
02:46:30,010 --> 02:46:30,010
doing something,
need to have dry hands.

3480
02:46:30,080 --> 02:46:32,120
Now it's squirted on my hands and rub 
it,

3481
02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:35,240
rub it all over my hands and then it 
would allow me to play pool better where

3482
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:40,260
I could concentrate on just playing.
I didn't have to worry about my hands 

3483
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:41,510
wiping them down every five minutes like
I used to drink.

3484
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:45,200
I used to bring a wet towel with me that
would wipe my hands with a wet towel and

3485
02:46:45,201 --> 02:46:47,750
then I would drive them off with a dry 
towel and I had to do that over and over

3486
02:46:47,751 --> 02:46:48,230
and over again.

3487
02:46:48,590 --> 02:46:51,860
My hands are sweating for no reason,
no reason.

3488
02:46:51,900 --> 02:46:56,900
It was a stupid game,
knocking the ball into another ball and 

3489
02:46:56,900 --> 02:46:57,890
I'm like life and death.
Life and death.

3490
02:46:57,891 --> 02:47:00,170
My body temperature is changing.
I'm sweating,

3491
02:47:00,590 --> 02:47:03,110
sweating over a fucking game.
Wasn't even for a lot of money,

3492
02:47:03,111 --> 02:47:08,111
you know,
playing a tournament or playing with a 

3493
02:47:08,111 --> 02:47:08,111
buddy and my hands are sweating like an 
asshole.

3494
02:47:08,111 --> 02:47:08,630
Yes.
Sweats.

3495
02:47:08,631 --> 02:47:09,770
Fucking weird,
isn't it?

3496
02:47:09,771 --> 02:47:12,140
What a strange thing that your body just
squirts out.

3497
02:47:12,141 --> 02:47:15,440
Saltwater whenever it gets too hot,
freaks out.

3498
02:47:15,860 --> 02:47:20,860
Well,
I've been on a hot yoga tear last two 

3499
02:47:20,860 --> 02:47:21,200
and a half months.
I got to tell you,

3500
02:47:21,320 --> 02:47:26,320
first of all,
there's two things that have been doing 

3501
02:47:26,320 --> 02:47:26,320
the last two and a half months really 
regularly.

3502
02:47:26,320 --> 02:47:27,110
And I know one of them is not feasible 
for a lot of people,

3503
02:47:27,111 --> 02:47:29,480
so don't complain.
And that's cryotherapy.

3504
02:47:29,900 --> 02:47:32,270
I know that Shit's expensive,
like 60 bucks every time you do it.

3505
02:47:32,630 --> 02:47:34,940
I'm fucking addicted dude.
I do it almost everyday.

3506
02:47:34,970 --> 02:47:37,340
Where do you do it?
I do it down here in woodland hills.

3507
02:47:37,341 --> 02:47:40,610
They have a place on Ventura Boulevard,
cryo healthcare.

3508
02:47:40,611 --> 02:47:44,510
There's another place in la,
but there's a lot of people that do it.

3509
02:47:44,540 --> 02:47:45,410
They just,
um,

3510
02:47:45,670 --> 02:47:47,990
it's not as effective,
but it's pretty fucking effective.

3511
02:47:48,320 --> 02:47:51,680
Just an ice bath.
Just fill up a tank filled with water or

3512
02:47:51,681 --> 02:47:56,681
a tub rather filled with water and a lot
of fucking ice and just climb on it and 

3513
02:47:56,681 --> 02:48:00,381
it's a box,
but there's something that happens when 

3514
02:48:00,381 --> 02:48:04,601
you ice yourself down like that.
The decrease of inflammation makes you 

3515
02:48:04,601 --> 02:48:06,530
feel fucking fantastic and it allows 
your body to heal more effectively.

3516
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:12,040
Like dude,
extreme cold is incredible for 

3517
02:48:12,040 --> 02:48:15,581
inflammation,
so I've done it every day except the 

3518
02:48:15,581 --> 02:48:18,761
weekends.
I didn't do it the weekend he did 

3519
02:48:18,761 --> 02:48:18,761
apparently to do today,
right before the show.

3520
02:48:18,761 --> 02:48:18,790
I do it.
I do it,

3521
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:23,800
try to do it five days a week these days
and I'm doing it five days a week and I 

3522
02:48:23,800 --> 02:48:25,370
fucking feel fantastic.
Fantastic.

3523
02:48:25,400 --> 02:48:28,190
I've heard that all my like little aches
and pains,

3524
02:48:28,191 --> 02:48:30,530
they're all like diminishing 
significantly.

3525
02:48:30,890 --> 02:48:33,560
Everything seems to be like loosening up
and relaxing,

3526
02:48:34,230 --> 02:48:36,410
like what's the mechanics of that?
Like what?

3527
02:48:36,411 --> 02:48:41,411
Explain it.
But the other thing I'm doing is hot 

3528
02:48:41,411 --> 02:48:43,451
yoga and the hot yoga in combination 
with that is very interesting because 

3529
02:48:43,451 --> 02:48:47,621
I've been doing the hot yoga at least 
two days a week and then I'll do like 

3530
02:48:47,621 --> 02:48:50,831
some other stretches,
like a third day a week with my other 

3531
02:48:50,831 --> 02:48:53,261
workouts that I do.
But I'm forcing myself to do two days a 

3532
02:48:53,261 --> 02:48:53,780
week of hot yoga.
It's fucking hard,

3533
02:48:53,781 --> 02:48:57,260
dude.
It's hard to do like surprisingly hard.

3534
02:48:57,470 --> 02:48:59,510
And the.
When the class is almost over,

3535
02:48:59,780 --> 02:49:01,280
I'm fucking exhausted.

3536
02:49:01,280 --> 02:49:04,640
I mean like really exhausted and so hot 
that I want to quit.

3537
02:49:04,850 --> 02:49:09,850
I want to quit.
Like the last 10 minutes is don't be a 

3538
02:49:09,850 --> 02:49:09,850
bitch.
That's the last 10 minutes.

3539
02:49:09,900 --> 02:49:13,170
All the exercises are fairly easy and 
it's just don't leave yet.

3540
02:49:13,350 --> 02:49:14,910
Don't leave yet.
Hang in there.

3541
02:49:14,970 --> 02:49:16,500
Don't leave yet.
Hang in there.

3542
02:49:16,860 --> 02:49:18,790
And your body's like,
dude is too fucking hot near.

3543
02:49:18,870 --> 02:49:21,510
You've got to just deal with it.
Just deal with it and get through.

3544
02:49:21,840 --> 02:49:26,840
And there's this.
I don't know if you've ever seen the 

3545
02:49:26,840 --> 02:49:26,840
podcasts I've done with Dr Rhonda 
Patrick.

3546
02:49:26,840 --> 02:49:28,080
Nope.
I can't wait to talk to her about this,

3547
02:49:28,081 --> 02:49:30,540
but she's just brilliant,
brilliant lady,

3548
02:49:30,541 --> 02:49:35,541
and she wrote a paper about sauna and 
one of the things about Saunas is that 

3549
02:49:35,541 --> 02:49:40,071
they've experienced this radical 
decrease in mortality rates amongst 

3550
02:49:40,381 --> 02:49:45,381
people who take sauna and she was like,
it's a 40 percent decrease across the 

3551
02:49:45,381 --> 02:49:45,381
board.

3552
02:49:45,381 --> 02:49:47,010
Everything with like cancer,
heart attacks,

3553
02:49:47,011 --> 02:49:49,290
all these different things.
There's an effect that's happening.

3554
02:49:49,291 --> 02:49:51,540
You mean like a steam hyper heat?
The Body Saunas?

3555
02:49:51,550 --> 02:49:52,770
Yeah.
You go into a sauna,

3556
02:49:52,771 --> 02:49:57,771
hot sauna.
There's something that happens when you 

3557
02:49:57,771 --> 02:50:00,231
extreme,
when you extremely heat up the body 

3558
02:50:00,231 --> 02:50:02,960
where the body has to respond to the 
heat and then it develops this reaction 

3559
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:05,850
to these extreme temperatures for short 
durations.

3560
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,520
Now I don't know how much time you're 
supposed to sit in a sauna,

3561
02:50:08,850 --> 02:50:12,150
but the time that you sit in a sauna,
whatever happens to your body,

3562
02:50:12,151 --> 02:50:17,151
once you get out and your body cools 
itself down and there is a compensatory 

3563
02:50:17,151 --> 02:50:21,441
mechanism that helps your body in some 
crazy way that they're still trying to 

3564
02:50:21,441 --> 02:50:25,281
understand now,
and the same can be said for Cryo 

3565
02:50:25,281 --> 02:50:26,220
therapy and cryotherapy.
I think it's called sidechains,

3566
02:50:26,370 --> 02:50:31,370
like when you get below 150 degrees,
your body produces these anti 

3567
02:50:31,370 --> 02:50:31,370
inflammatory responses.

3568
02:50:31,370 --> 02:50:35,780
There's Pub Med studies on it.
There's a bunch of different studies 

3569
02:50:35,780 --> 02:50:35,780
explained to her.
I don't understand.

3570
02:50:35,780 --> 02:50:36,390
You don't because you're only in there 
for three minutes.

3571
02:50:36,790 --> 02:50:41,790
Seems like a long time.
Seems like a long time while you're in 

3572
02:50:41,790 --> 02:50:43,971
there too,
but it's enough that you can get out of 

3573
02:50:43,971 --> 02:50:46,101
it.
Like when it gets more than three 

3574
02:50:46,101 --> 02:50:47,481
minutes,
it gets real tricky and you don't have 

3575
02:50:47,481 --> 02:50:47,481
to.
You don't touch anything like your hands

3576
02:50:47,481 --> 02:50:48,420
are in gloves,
surgical mask on your face.

3577
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:51,510
You have earmuffs and the extremities 
are covered.

3578
02:50:51,511 --> 02:50:54,480
Your extremities are covered with gloves
and your toes are covered with socks.

3579
02:50:54,481 --> 02:50:57,780
And then you wear crocs.
So you're standing in rubber crocs,

3580
02:50:57,930 --> 02:50:59,760
so your feet don't touch the out of your
cock.

3581
02:50:59,820 --> 02:51:01,980
Your cock is in your underwear.
Believe it or not,

3582
02:51:01,981 --> 02:51:04,150
the congress doesn't get that cold.
I mean,

3583
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:05,700
I deal with it.
I deal with my cock,

3584
02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:07,370
my legs get cold,
my,

3585
02:51:07,460 --> 02:51:08,130
my,
um,

3586
02:51:08,160 --> 02:51:09,840
my nipples get fucking cold.

3587
02:51:09,930 --> 02:51:12,330
Sometimes I wind up doing this.
I want to cover my nipples,

3588
02:51:12,900 --> 02:51:17,900
but for the most part what's happening 
is your body is freaking the fuck out 

3589
02:51:17,900 --> 02:51:21,380
because it's freezing cold and then 
because the fact that it's not freezing 

3590
02:51:21,380 --> 02:51:24,981
cold anymore,
it releases this burst of these 

3591
02:51:24,981 --> 02:51:27,741
sidechains and this,
this feeling of just warmth and power 

3592
02:51:27,741 --> 02:51:31,620
through your body where everything just 
feels like things are knocked loose.

3593
02:51:31,800 --> 02:51:36,330
It's almost like a river runs through a 
clogged up stream and knocks out all the

3594
02:51:36,331 --> 02:51:39,060
trees and I want to do it man.
Oh please.

3595
02:51:39,061 --> 02:51:40,700
I don't want to take it.
I'll take you tomorrow.

3596
02:51:40,740 --> 02:51:42,450
Want to go tomorrow?
I can't do it tomorrow.

3597
02:51:43,380 --> 02:51:45,780
When can you do it?
I got to look at my youtube.

3598
02:51:45,830 --> 02:51:47,320
Well,
we'll talk about it often off screen,

3599
02:51:47,321 --> 02:51:49,260
but you're going to do the comedy store 
on Friday.

3600
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:51,870
Let's do it before the comments died.
Done.

3601
02:51:52,110 --> 02:51:52,890
That's great.
Well,

3602
02:51:54,470 --> 02:51:57,630
there's one on La Sienna gotta.
Do a workout before that too.

3603
02:51:57,631 --> 02:52:02,631
Is that I will have like,
well sometimes I'll actually like to do 

3604
02:52:02,631 --> 02:52:06,501
it after a freeze.
They like to freeze first and then work 

3605
02:52:06,501 --> 02:52:06,501
out later,
but apparently

3606
02:52:06,501 --> 02:52:11,070
you can't do that with the ice bath.
So they were describing this the other 

3607
02:52:11,070 --> 02:52:11,070
day.
Don't listen to me,

3608
02:52:11,070 --> 02:52:11,500
but this was something that they were 
talking about.

3609
02:52:11,770 --> 02:52:12,550
Uh,
Ryan,

3610
02:52:12,551 --> 02:52:17,551
the guy who runs the woodland hills 
location was telling me that if you was 

3611
02:52:17,551 --> 02:52:22,050
telling somebody else I was 
eavesdropping that if you do an ice 

3612
02:52:22,050 --> 02:52:22,050
bath,
you're done for the day.

3613
02:52:22,050 --> 02:52:26,041
You don't work out today because you're 
sitting in that thing for like 20 

3614
02:52:26,041 --> 02:52:26,041
minutes and it's freezing cold and you 
know,

3615
02:52:26,041 --> 02:52:30,380
you know,
you're apparently you could fuck 

3616
02:52:30,380 --> 02:52:30,380
yourself up if you work out hard after 
that.

3617
02:52:30,380 --> 02:52:31,570
Funny Man.
I'm sorry,

3618
02:52:31,571 --> 02:52:33,790
I didn't mean to cut you off.
You're so fucking cool.

3619
02:52:33,880 --> 02:52:38,880
I just realized that I realized like I'm
sitting talking to a guy and an 

3620
02:52:38,880 --> 02:52:43,290
astronaut suit about going on Friday.
Freeze my body.

3621
02:52:43,660 --> 02:52:46,430
Ice Chamber Bucks.

3622
02:52:48,450 --> 02:52:50,350
Well listen man,
if you can do it,

3623
02:52:50,351 --> 02:52:51,820
you should do it.
It sounds awesome.

3624
02:52:51,821 --> 02:52:56,821
I would want to say,
and even like be the guy that tells 

3625
02:52:56,821 --> 02:52:59,011
people while you're wearing a nasa suit 
that you need to get a trier agentic 

3626
02:52:59,011 --> 02:52:59,770
chamber for 270 degrees below zero for 
three minutes.

3627
02:53:00,200 --> 02:53:01,210
Yeah,
you should do that.

3628

We can do these things.
Yeah.

3630
02:53:10,270 --> 02:53:11,800
You have an isolation tank in your 
house.

3631
02:53:12,100 --> 02:53:14,320
You can do these things.
You have a fucking Mercedes now.

02:53:18,701 --> 02:53:20,440
So you're selling out all over the 
country.

3635
02:53:21,380 --> 02:53:23,260
Ideas broke all the records in Boston 
this weekend.

3636
02:53:23,290 --> 02:53:25,780
Oh good.
That makes a sold out in advance.

3637
02:53:25,781 --> 02:53:27,760
Before I even got there.
The place was packed.

3638
02:53:27,820 --> 02:53:28,370

I haven't done it.

3642
02:53:31,890 --> 02:53:33,130
It's very,
it's very good.

3643
02:53:33,310 --> 02:53:35,770
