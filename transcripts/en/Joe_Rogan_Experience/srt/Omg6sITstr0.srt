1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:01,801
Doo,
Doo,

2
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:02,790
Doo Doo Doo

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,020
two.
All right.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,880
Kyle Kingsbury,
Hawaiian brother.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,950
I'm doing great brother.
I have a present for you.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,520
This is a legit fanny pack.
Look at that because your a fanny pack

7
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:21,740
enthusiast.
He's one of the few manly men than I can

8
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:24,230
count upon to almost always be wearing a
fanny pack.

9
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:25,700
Wow.
Look at that baby.

10
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:28,010
That's a higher primate dotcom special.
Oh,

11
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:30,800
this is phenomenal.
I wanted to get one of these back in the

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,240
day.
And you were out of stock.

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,080
Yeah,
that's right.

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,270
Quite some time because that fucking
sell out of these things.

15
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:38,600
Believe it or not.
I believe that these are made by roots

16
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:43,520
and they have like a.
The pocket is got a higher primate.com,

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,540
like things stamped into it,
but it's fucking high level baby.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,220
I found out about that one from dice
clay came in,

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,660
he's another fanny pack,
enthusiastic.

20
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:53,500
I love dies.

21
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,410
And he had sweatpants on and uh,
he was wearing this beautiful leather

22
00:00:57,411 --> 00:00:59,420
fanny pack and I was like,
where did you get that?

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,710
Oh,
so roots one,

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,460
it's the best.
And they took it off and showed it to me

25
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,400
were like,
you know,

26
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:05,980
girls will like look at each other's
persons.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,330
That's what we were doing.
Oh yeah.

28
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,830
You inspected the pockets.
You wanted to say this is,

29
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,080
where is my wallet?
My cell phone can go.

30
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:14,600
This is where my chapstick will go.
So I bought one.

31
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,850
It's legit as fuck.
And then after I bought it,

32
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,440
um,
I was uh,

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,100
I was so in love with and I was like,
they make these for me and put my stamp

34
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:24,380
on it.
And they said yes.

35
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,600
So the zipper pocket,
if you look at it,

36
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:29,180
it has the higher primates stamp with
the champ of the light bulb above his

37
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:30,014
head.

38
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,580
Pretty Sweet,
Huh?

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,780
Yeah.
This is amazing.

40
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,470
Look with the one you're wearing,
bro,

41
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:35,420
is like,
it screams,

42
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,430
hiker.
Screams hitchhiker.

43
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,370
It is.
I got this pack safe.

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,680
I got this before.
Go into central and South America

45
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,870
because you can lock the zippers so
people can't get into it.

46
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,760
Can't pick pocket.
Yeah.

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,010
Cables on the,
uh,

48
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,800
on the band.
They're like steel cables so they can't

49
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:53,840
cut them.
Rarely do like a lot of slash and grab

50
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:54,800
stuff over there.
I guess.

51
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,450
Jesus Christ.
Let me see this thing.

52
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:58,430
You've got my ma.
I need to change brands.

53
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,800
Survival pack.
It's back.

54
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:02,240
This might travel.
Wait,

55
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:05,210
so you could do curls with the travel.
Wait,

56
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,440
and this has a chords in it when you
feel to have them little cords,

57
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:11,860
you can't cut it.
Heavy duty ratable.

58
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh my goodness.
And when you,

59
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,270
when you click that in there,
there's a three buttons to open it up.

60
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,260
Not your normal two button action.
Oh yeah.

61
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:22,520
One,
two and three.

62
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,010
This is legit.
They got the RF R I r I f,

63
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,190
D Rfd,
Card radio frequency.

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,010
So if you're passing by and some little
hackers on his laptop,

65
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:37,330
he can't steal all your apple pay
information from your iphone and shit

66
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:38,600
like that.
Someone can do that.

67
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,000
Fuck yeah.
Just walking by you.

68
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,310
Haven't you seen rogue nation?
Try not to.

69
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,010
I tried to try to stay as far out of the
loop with all these fucking hacker

70
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:49,611
wipper.
Stanford.

71
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:52,820
What does this bad boy is?
So that's where you click all those

72
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,890
three together.
You put a lock on it.

73
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,070
I see.
Dude,

74
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,760
this is impressive stuff.
They made it out of Calvin bar.

75
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,590
It'd be even better.
Cover your Dick.

76
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,320
You know,
they make clothes now out of Kevlar that

77
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,600
they look like regular clothes,
but you can take a bullet with him,

78
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,650
like how it's going to fall.
It would penetrate you slightly and then

79
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,240
come out and feel awesome.
Yeah.

80
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,060
But it's going to keep the from going
through into your body.

81
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,250
It'll hurt.
What do you think that would feel like?

82
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,880
It depends on the round,
but uh,

83
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,530
it wouldn't feel good.
It's,

84
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,910
I've,
I've talked to people that have been

85
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,670
shot with bulletproof vests that say say
it's like getting punched.

86
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,280
But.
So are these plates like in pants and

87
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,020
shit like that?
Or is this like some type of material

88
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:36,430
that's moveable?
It's both.

89
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,860
They have some of them,
they even have some that prevent you

90
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:41,090
from knife attacks.
They have like a,

91
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,440
a thick Mesh Kevlar that seems more
real.

92
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:47,710
Kind of like a chain mail.
The bad guy wears in commando.

93
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,761
Yeah.
There's a,

94
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,190
uh,
there was a vice documentary or vice

95
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:56,191
piece on this guy who is known for
making bulletproof close.

96
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:59,500
He's a tailor,
I want to say Columbia,

97
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:01,840
I think he's in Bogota,
but he's,

98
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,330
um,
he's known for making like really nice

99
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:06,640
clothes that just happened to be
bulletproof.

100
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,550
Like the whole deal underwear,
everything.

101
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,860
That's pretty bad ass.
That's pretty bad.

102
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,950
That's like the kingsmen guy as I said.
Yeah.

103
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,540
Here you go.
Israeli reporter testing and knife proof

104
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,240
vest ends up getting stabbed.
Well,

105
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,870
well that's not good.
Well,

106
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,450
he actually got stabbed all the way
through or just a little bit.

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,100
Oh Jesus Christ.

108
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,610
This is a commando knife and he's just
gonna fucking stab him with this thing.

109
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,000
Is this guy doing sign language in the
lower left?

110
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,640
Oh,
that's hilarious.

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,730
You wouldn't pick up the stab here.
Penetrating through.

112
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,633
We,

113
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,870
I missed.
He said,

114
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,850
yeah,
fucking dudes going to be bleeding.

115
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,700
That dude downplayed it pretty well for
getting stabbed.

116
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,571
Yeah.
He,

117
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:58,550
uh,
took it.

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,940
He took it quite easily.
Jesus Christ.

119
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,930
I guess it works I guess a little bit.
Yeah,

120
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,770
I mean it's definitely better than not
having that on.

121
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:09,650
He would be dead works sometimes.
It works a little bit.

122
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,890
It was like step me like this.
That'll live in color.

123
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,920
Your stay here to be like this.
Well,

124
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:18,320
you've seen those martial arts
demonstrations with those guys.

125
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:20,000
Do that.
Like come at you with a knife.

126
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,360
The other guy,
the stabbing technique.

127
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,320
Always.
Yeah.

128
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,400
They say that the best way to knife
fight is actually to put your arm

129
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:31,100
forward.
You wrap your clothes or on your arm and

130
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:32,700
put a knife in your back hand.
Meanwhile,

131
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,960
why the fuck do I know what the best way
to knife fight is?

132
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,090
What are the odds you're ever going to
get in a knife fight like you and

133
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:41,840
another guy on the beach like circling
each other with a knife and your jacket

134
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,250
wrapped around your forearm and b,
it starts playing to town.

135
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:45,891
Oh No,
no,

136
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:46,840
no,
no,

137
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:47,470
no,
no,

138
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,201
no.
Yeah,

139
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:49,610
that's right.
They were switchblades right?

140
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,340
They had a little knife fight.
They were tied together.

141
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,170
People just do knife fights in the
movies.

142
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,290
Remember those.
That was a big thing in movies and been

143
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,010
back in the

144
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,570
old musicals.
What was that?

145
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:02,600
A West side story there.
They did Saturday night fever.

146
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,640
Have a knife fight.
It did,

147
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:06,290
right.
They had a knife fight too.

148
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,540
What the fuck is wrong with people back
then?

149
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,150
All the cocaine.
Is that what it was?

150
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,800
I don't know.
What did the cocaine kick can?

151
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,760
It was in the eighties,
right?

152
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,630
I think it was around in the seventies
and it just got giant in the eighties.

153
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,060
Have you watched narcos?
No,

154
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:24,230
but I hear it's awesome to actually.
Eddie Bravo to always talks about how

155
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,370
it's just.
Yeah,

156
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,720
he's hooked.
He got me.

157
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,960
He got me hooked and now I'm hooked.
I'm trying to spread the world,

158
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,150
spread it to the world.
We're looking for new shows.

159
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,070
It's a fucking awesome show,
man.

160
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,600
It's incredible.
It's really,

161
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,060
really nuts.
So it was a documentary style or.

162
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,923
No,
it's um,

163
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,650
there's some real footage of uh,
the actual med,

164
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:46,720
a in cartel and you know,
there's some real footage of like the

165
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,190
different busts and some murder footage.

166
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,230
Some bodies that they really real,
real,

167
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,350
um,
like some of the horrible atrocities

168
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:55,550
they committed.
They,

169
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,090
they show you real footage of that.
But for the most part it just is the

170
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:01,760
story of Pablo Escobar and his rise to
power.

171
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,920
That's right.
It is fucking bad ass dude.

172
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,320
It's so dope.
They just did such a good job.

173
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,150
Netflix just as Netflix.
Yeah.

174
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,250
Okay.
They have so much fucking money,

175
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:11,084
man.
They can,

176
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,140
they can put together these things and
make them like,

177
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,750
like 10 movies,
you know,

178
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,540
it's like ten one hour movies.
That's the best.

179
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,540
I can't really.
We have trouble watching regular tv now.

180
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,970
Like hbo kind of spoiled us.
You watch a show.

181
00:07:23,971 --> 00:07:27,080
I mean even though the beauty of Netflix
is that you get it all at once,

182
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,170
so the whole season,
but even still like we're watching

183
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,010
dexter back in the day or.
And there was really only a few good

184
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:35,440
seasons there,
but you know,

185
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,360
whatever show that's on that,
that you can watch straight through with

186
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,980
no commercials and no fast forwarding.

187
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,600
Yeah.
Night and day better than having to use

188
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:44,950
the dvr and sit through the commercials.
This just,

189
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,030
that's caveman shit's.
It's terrible.

190
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,560
It's old days.
It's terrible.

191
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:50,560
Those are the old days were done with
the commercial.

192
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:52,340
They need to come up with a new way to
sell you shit,

193
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,430
you know,
like interrupting TV shows.

194
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:56,600
It just makes me not want to buy their
stuff.

195
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,930
There was some new comedy on tbs.
I don't know why we were watching it,

196
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:04,670
but they kept showing Ford ads during
the show and they were trying.

197
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,810
They would make like a little chime,
like pong and then they would have this

198
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:12,080
giant Ford.com on the bottom.
Like they were trying to do it so

199
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:16,430
blatant that it was humorous,
but at the same time it was like fucking

200
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:18,590
irking me.
Like what was this ridiculous?

201
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:22,280
It was some new comedy on tbs,
some cheese Dick,

202
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:23,990
a cop show.

203
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,620
So while the show is on the,
the commercials playing over the

204
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:31,430
dialogue and all that stuff would just
go home and then you'd see this thing

205
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:35,610
like superimposed over the bottom of the
screen for Daca and was repeated though.

206
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,473
Like,
I mean,

207
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,880
after the commercials you see this just
pop up and they're like,

208
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,680
this is the future of TV.
Then we're like that.

209
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,470
That's what they're doing to try to
counter dvrs.

210
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,550
Just stick it even more in your face.
It's fucking gross,

211
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,930
man.
Just over the top with it.

212
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,060
So stupid.
It's such a dumb way to advertise.

213
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:59,910
They just have to figure out a better
way to let people know about their shit,

214
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,021
you know?
Just some,

215
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:03,600
some cool way.
That's not the way to do it,

216
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,350
but that's neither here nor there.
No,

217
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,340
I love saying that.
I never get to know their heritage.

218
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,750
So Dude,
I'm on that diet.

219
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,040
I'm on the ketogenic diet now or trying
to get into it and you know,

220
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:21,060
you talking about it with me sort of
inspired me a little bit because one of

221
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,280
the big things a lot of people are
saying you can't be.

222
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,950
You can't do explosive activities.
Bullshit.

223
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,830
Kyle Kingsbury's punk and you fucking
nerds.

224
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,660
Oh,
you nutrition nerds.

225
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,501
I'll tell you what,
man,

226
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:34,530
if you get into any sort of a diet
online or tell people you're gonna,

227
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:39,360
try something.
The fucking experts come so many people.

228
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,580
Even when that's why I deleted my
facebook account,

229
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,280
I just couldn't stand over the years in
the UFC.

230
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:45,390
I just would say,
oh sure,

231
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:46,820
yeah,
I allow you to be friends with.

232
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:47,880
I need to be friends.
That kind of thing.

233
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:51,570
And then over time you've got 5,000
people that think through your pals,

234
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,690
like at least on twitter,
I follow who I want to follow.

235
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,000
That's that.
I'm not subscribed to any of their shit.

236
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,600
You know,
one point 7 million people following you

237
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,580
online on twitter alone,
you know,

238
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,650
you post,
you're going to do this and people come

239
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:07,350
out the woodwork about it.
I would write about like,

240
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,550
oh,
I just read this book.

241
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:09,900
It's phenomenal.
Check it out.

242
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,090
You know?
And then everybody's got to come up with

243
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,330
this.
So here's a article I found online.

244
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:16,440
I will send you the link and this guy's
a total wack job.

245
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,360
He's an idiot.
This like this.

246
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,080
Like this one paragraph somebody wrote,
it's going to totally dispel and throw

247
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:25,110
out the window what this guy spent years
researching and putting together in his

248
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:25,950
book.
Yeah.

249
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:28,440
It's always like Vegan news.com.
You're like,

250
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,650
oh,
Jesus sits on a real source of dare you.

251
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,000
But um,
this,

252
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:33,900
uh,
this diet,

253
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,940
I,
so I've been on it now only for four

254
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:36,410
days.

255
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,090
This is today I think is the fourth,
third or fourth day,

256
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,310
let's call it the third day,
third day,

257
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,980
100 percent.
And uh,

258
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,650
I had headaches unlike the,
somewhere around the second day I

259
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:48,960
started getting a little bit ahead of.
I read that on your instagram,

260
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,850
but it's got a fix for it.
What's the fix?

261
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,460
So a lot of people,
when they transition low carb,

262
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,280
they have,
there's a window before you start

263
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,150
producing ketones on your own,
right?

264
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,330
You can jumpstart that window with
fasting,

265
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,080
which is a total pain in the ass,
especially if you're carbohydrate

266
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,980
dependent or you can cheat it by using
mct oil.

267
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,450
So if you up your MCTs,
the first three days kind of borderline

268
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:14,490
where you might shoot yourself,
then you have,

269
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,240
you totally negate any of that really
feeling like groggy.

270
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:20,120
Like I don't have the energy or fuck
man,

271
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,770
I can't move like you,
you can eliminate that completely with

272
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:23,340
MCTs.

273
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,060
Why does mct oil make you shit yourself?
Because it does.

274
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,190
It does.
And I'm not going to lie.

275
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:32,640
Uh,
I've shipped myself at least five times

276
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:37,641
in the past two years as an adult.
Some drunk milk I don't drink anymore,

277
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,460
but yeah.
What was it?

278
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,560
The mcts.
I got a little cocky,

279
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:46,380
you know,
like I know I measure everything out

280
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:47,900
religiously now.
I mean,

281
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,680
but in this,
everything's fine tuning.

282
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:52,950
It's all personal process.
I had to start with a teaspoon.

283
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,200
Now I'm up to four tablespoons per pot
of coffee.

284
00:11:56,201 --> 00:12:01,201
I make a whole pot blended up with a two
to one ratio of kerrygold butter to the

285
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:04,840
MCT oil.
Then I have my little Stevia drops,

286
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,040
that kind of thing.
If I'm on the road,

287
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,600
I got other stuff,
but I don't.

288
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,460
I used to,
if I was on the road and I'm having

289
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,080
coffee,
I would just take a gulp of mct Nixon.

290
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,190
You bring your own whipping cream here.
What is that heavy cream?

291
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:16,510
Yeah,
you got to get on it bro.

292
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Unless you don't have a.
If you don't have a lot of heavy cream.

293
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,930
Got to get on it,
bro.

294
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,110
You got to Stevia drops here.
Just like Jim Carrey does.

295
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,150
What's the,
just like Jim Carrey,

296
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,350
Jim Carrey has stevia drops a everyone
go check out the.

297
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,300
The coffee.
What does the coffee in cars with

298
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:38,140
comedians.
Oh,

299
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:41,260
he brings Stevia drops or the.
He does it when he's out with Seinfeld.

300
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,900
It's awesome.
So.

301
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,150
So tell me why do you have heavy
whipping cream?

302
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:47,820
Well,
no,

303
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,960
this is,
first of all is mark sisson detail

304
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,700
earlier.
This is grass fed free range.

305
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:54,430
All good stuff.
I don't have a lactose intolerant or a

306
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:55,810
dairy intolerance.
So that's,

307
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,570
let's iron that out right now.
I don't recommend this to anybody who

308
00:12:58,571 --> 00:12:59,340
does.

309
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,840
Um,
but this is a way to get more fat.

310
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,430
And that's really what you're trying to
do.

311
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:10,050
We'd as natural people from a primal
standpoint when in periods of Ketosis,

312
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,510
no matter where we were on planet earth,
so I know you were talking about the

313
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:16,750
other day,
like what is this ancestral diet stuff,

314
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:19,310
that kind of stuff that's based on where
you live.

315
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,360
So if you had ancestors from the Poles,
then you likely had big game and fruits

316
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:28,060
and vegetables and things that grew in
colder climates,

317
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,710
you know,
like Kale and shit like that.

318
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,690
If you were by the equator,
smaller stuff,

319
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,330
smaller live animals like chicken,
fish,

320
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:36,520
those kinds of things and then much more
carbohydrates,

321
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,830
but both,
no matter where you were from,

322
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,010
you had periods where you didn't eat.
So that's someone you'd produce your own

323
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,680
ketones to remain in a ketogenic state.

324
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,940
He really do have to have a much higher
level of fat and people think like way

325
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:51,610
more to where you.
It's counterintuitive,

326
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,560
especially with cholesterol and things
like that.

327
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:56,470
But the research is out.
I mean these guys are putting together

328
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:57,130
things.
Uh,

329
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,740
Dr David Perlmutter wrote Grain Brain in
2013.

330
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,540
He had researched from 2013 and 2012 and
2011 all in the book in Twenty 15.

331
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:08,140
He followed up with brain maker.
Brand new studies are being put in that

332
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:10,990
book.
So this is like the very latest and what

333
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:15,190
they're showing across the board is for
all the mental disorders like

334
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,690
Alzheimer's,
dementia,

335
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,680
Parkinson's,
they all have to do with a really high

336
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,180
blood sugar levels over time.
So one person might manifest as type two

337
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:27,010
diabetes and other person might get
Alzheimer's.

338
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:29,950
It's just your genetic coding.
That's the genetic difference.

339
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,920
Eating like Shit's going to get you to
have that disease,

340
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,200
you know,
manifest itself.

341
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,840
It's just sugar itself seems to be just
really,

342
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:39,310
really bad.
It's a bad deal.

343
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,300
Yeah.
So.

344
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,920
But as you'll find it's really easy to
eat too much protein on the Diet and

345
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:48,880
that can knock you out of ketosis.
So really getting too much protein

346
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:50,320
knocks you out of Ketosis.
There's a,

347
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,220
there's a process the body does called
gluconeogenesis and this is kind of

348
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:56,650
where Atkins failed a lot of people.
Even my dad was,

349
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,493
oh,
dot koons.

350
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,090
I lost weight and what I felt like,
Shit,

351
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:01,040
you know,
I have this pain across my chest and

352
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,790
they call it like Atkins fever.
Feel like flu symptoms,

353
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:05,624
right?
Right.

354
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,750
That comes from what's your,
what's your energy source?

355
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,390
So if people do a low carb diet and they
think,

356
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:12,680
well,
I don't want to have too much fat

357
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:15,770
because that's not healthy and they
don't understand good fats and bad fats.

358
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,521
So they say,
okay,

359
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:19,820
well I'll just stop my protein to fill
up and I'll have a little bit of fat and

360
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:23,120
low carb.
Well now your body has to take protein

361
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:27,440
and turn it back into glucose and that's
what gluconeogenesis does and it's a

362
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:29,000
very you,
your body will do it,

363
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,810
but it's not an easy thing to do.
Fat and carbohydrates are much,

364
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,340
much easier as energy sources.
So if you can keep protein moderate,

365
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:41,210
that's why now modified Atkins or
ketogenic diets,

366
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,970
they'll tell you it's high fat,
moderate protein,

367
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,140
low carb.
So when you say like moderate,

368
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:48,620
like how many grams,
grams of protein do you get in a day?

369
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,050
That's all individual for anybody.
You know,

370
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:54,380
if you're working out how you work out
you about to 20,

371
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,640
something like that.
I went to 25 right now.

372
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:59,510
I probably have,
I don't know,

373
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,720
definitely under 140 grams of protein.

374
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,090
Really?
That's interesting because I'm.

375
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,180
The bodybuilder method was one gram per
pound at least,

376
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,950
and they were doing six,
seven meals a day.

377
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,620
Look the.
So if you're were putting on size,

378
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,990
I'm not going to tilt.
Dorian Yates how to put on size.

379
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,940
Like he,
they,

380
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,240
they eat that way specifically for gains
and that is scientifically proven to

381
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:25,310
help with gains.
You're eating like a child basically.

382
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:27,410
You have a newborn.
They eat every two hours.

383
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,540
They're,
they're eating everything.

384
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,980
Carbohydrates,
protein and fat.

385
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,600
Right?
So when you want to gain size,

386
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,260
that's the way to do it.
But for this you don't necessarily need

387
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,880
that.
And you can employ different methods

388
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:41,840
like intermittent fasting where they
talk about skip breakfast and just eat

389
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,790
between 12 and seven.
You're not that protein window of Oh my,

390
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,280
my nitrogen balance is lowering.
I'm going to lose muscle mass.

391
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,163
It's total crap.

392
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,201
They will tell you,
oh,

393
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:52,170
you skip a meal,
you're gonna,

394
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,790
you're gonna.
Get weak,

395
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,290
bro.
Total crap.

396
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,220
All the hormones that give us,
um,

397
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,150
recovery,
anything like that,

398
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,940
igf one and growth hormone,
they all go through the roof when we

399
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,010
donate.
So the longer we fast the hierarchy,

400
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:09,050
ketone production is the hierarchy.
Anti catabolic hormones are so their

401
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:12,230
muscle preserving.
Now you could do a fast incorrectly and

402
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,120
you know,
you go run a wrong long race or,

403
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,200
or if you did high intensity stuff
fasted then yeah,

404
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,980
you'd be running into problems there
with that because that's autolysis

405
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,750
right?
Your body starts to break down muscle

406
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,130
tissue.
Is that what it's called?

407
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,230
Autolysis because you're working.
Glycolytic.

408
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:29,900
This is all right in there in the primal
endurance book.

409
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:32,240
But Marxist,
I got the pick that up right after it

410
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:33,440
was on the show.
Yeah,

411
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:33,630
I didn't.

412
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,380
Neil Kendall,
I really enjoyed talking to that guy.

413
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,490
That was.
Yeah,

414
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:40,460
that was a really cool conversation and
a very eyeopening.

415
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,160
You know,
one,

416
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,160
one thing that really opened my eyes are
really had me thinking was they've shown

417
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,070
on studies recently on children that
have epilepsy,

418
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:54,660
that putting them in a ketogenic state
seems to stop epileptic seizures or

419
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,380
significantly reduce them.
That's how the Diet was developed in the

420
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:02,520
19 twenties that I think it was John
Hopkins University or hospital,

421
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,110
not university,
Johns Hopkins,

422
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,740
whatever put together.
They had a team of guys there that

423
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:09,180
figured it out.
And um,

424
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,360
there's actually a guy
who was on the Tim Ferriss podcast.

425
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:18,510
Dr Dominic D'agostino,
who is awesome.

426
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:19,680
Yeah,
check him out.

427
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,030
He's out.
I heard that one.

428
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,400
South Florida.
He's fasted for seven days and then left

429
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,720
the house for 15 reps,
did five 85 or single,

430
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:31,770
then gave a lecture to 300 plus people
on fasting and ketogenic diets.

431
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,450
That guy's a trip.
He's,

432
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,140
he's really fascinating.
Super fucking intelligent now,

433
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,380
like you're listening to them talk about
it and how he travels with his own

434
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,860
exogenous ketones that he throws into
his food.

435
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:48,861
Have you tried those yet?
Know how nasty the rocket fuel stuff

436
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,390
that when they first came out with a
liquid.

437
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,920
It is,
it is jet fuel.

438
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,461
I mean,
it'll,

439
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:54,990
it'll make you a quiver.
I mean,

440
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,780
I think that stuff tastes worse than,
than Iowasca.

441
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,400
But uh,
the now the new stuff,

442
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:02,460
they make it with Stevia.
It's all natural flavors like orange,

443
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,500
Quito,
candidates.

444
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,410
It's awesome stuff.
You.

445
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,840
What's the,
what's the thought process between

446
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,800
behind eating exoticness ketones?
How does that work?

447
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,940
Well,
here's what I've noticed.

448
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,360
I'm,
if I'm in a ketogenic state and Keto

449
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:17,160
adapted and I'm producing my own
ketones,

450
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,220
I feel a huge bump from a product like,
like that sergeant in addition,

451
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,573
right?

452
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,070
Uh,
if I'm in a carbohydrate necessary,

453
00:19:27,071 --> 00:19:28,680
you know,
energy system and I haven't been in

454
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:30,970
Ketosis for awhile and then I have like,
oh,

455
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:32,670
okay,
well I'm going to get low sleep tonight,

456
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,030
so I want ketones.
I might feel like a slight difference,

457
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,110
but it's not going to be nearly as
dramatic as if I'm already in Ketosis.

458
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,280
Really?
Yeah.

459
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,740
Which is odd to me.
I don't know the mechanism of how it

460
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:47,250
works or if my body just more in tuned
to use them when there's no

461
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:50,310
carbohydrates there,
but it's night and day.

462
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,190
I think the product is expensive,
like 75,

463
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:58,191
85 bucks for 15 servings probably we're
going so I wouldn't use it every day,

464
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,580
but I'd use it for like a big race.
A Tasha and I are doing a 50 K in Zion

465
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,080
coming up in April.
I'll be using them for that for sure.

466
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,890
You would do it the morning of the race
during the race,

467
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:13,260
during the race,
like 15 minutes beforehand and then

468
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:15,870
every couple hours in for sure.
And now.

469
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,240
How long have you been doing a Ketogenic
Diet?

470
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,780
A man,
at least a year and a half.

471
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,780
I've been in and out.
Obviously I'm not going to.

472
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,670
There is no point where I'll never eat
carbs again.

473
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,100
Yeah,
they're phenomenal.

474
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,450
There's periods of times where I'll do
like a 12 week block,

475
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,700
strict Kurtosis or 16 weeks in a row.
Straight district toast.

476
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,760
What do you find when you do that?
Like what's the difference?

477
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:42,060
The biggest thing that I feel is a
cognitive boost,

478
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,110
it's night and day.
The sharpness I have mentally is a.

479
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:47,790
I mean,
that's,

480
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,930
that's,
that's really what keeps me coming back

481
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:53,180
to it is the mental clarity and focus.
Um,

482
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,550
and then that's really interesting to
lose a little bit of water weight

483
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,600
because glycogen holds water in the
muscles so you don't lose any strength,

484
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,070
but you'll lose some of that water
weight.

485
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,740
And uh,
I just feel more flexible.

486
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:08,800
So when I do yoga and things like that,
like I can get into postures I could

487
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:12,640
never get into when a carbs.
Like I can't get into Lotus when I'm,

488
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,280
when I'm eating carbs,
even if it's only five pounds difference

489
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,100
in my overall body weight,
I can get into ketosis.

490
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,710
Oh yeah.
What the fuck.

491
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,290
So what,
where is it binding in your knees and

492
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,280
your hips?
Like what's,

493
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:27,760
what's holding you back while you're
holding water in for every gram of

494
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:30,070
glycogen,
you hold four grams of water in the

495
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:30,820
muscle.
So.

496
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,570
So it makes sense if you are loading on
carbohydrates and things,

497
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:37,780
even if you're not carb loading,
but if your carb dependent,

498
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,020
your muscles are going to hold more
water than if they weren't.

499
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,080
Is there any benefit to that as far as
utilization of energy or ketones?

500
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,470
I mean this is all coming out of Steve
Finney and Jeff Volek,

501
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,690
they wrote the art and science of low
carbohydrate living in the art and

502
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:56,710
science of low carbohydrate performance
and mark sisson of references them.

503
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,840
They really broke down studies on
athletes in a ketogenic diet and things

504
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:05,080
like that and saw exactly what,
what kind of enhancements that are being

505
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:05,350
done.

506
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,310
And they kind of broke the mold of what
was done before when they ran tests,

507
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,980
you know,
gatorade was running tests and it was

508
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:12,820
coming up like,
hey,

509
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:15,700
if you do this,
you simply aren't going to be able to

510
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,470
outperform somebody who has
carbohydrates.

511
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,690
They weren't looking at somebody that
was keto adapted.

512
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,400
So it does take six to eight weeks to
make your body prefer fat.

513
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,310
Okay.
So what they were doing was just trying

514
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:29,310
it on people.
They put them in a state of Ketosis for

515
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:32,860
like a couple of weeks and then two
weeks exactly two weeks or six to eight

516
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:34,210
weeks,
six to eight weeks.

517
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:36,610
And other people will tell you the
longer the better.

518
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:39,250
So if you were like,
these guys that are winning the western

519
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:40,840
states,
100 is 100 mile race,

520
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,700
um,
they're,

521
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:44,290
they're in it for years.
You know,

522
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:48,180
you do pretty strict for a year and a
half and then you see some,

523
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,770
some significant jumps in fat oxidation
rates.

524
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,740
So how many,
how much can I break down in an hour

525
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,130
while I'm under stress?
That changes dramatically.

526
00:22:57,131 --> 00:23:00,160
The longer you stay in it.
Now when you do that,

527
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,030
is it beneficial to put on some body fat
for a long race like that?

528
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:06,970
Because if you're in a ketogenic state,
your body can burn off that fat.

529
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,900
You would have.
They they've cry can't,

530
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,710
I can't read off numbers off the top of
my head,

531
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:13,180
but I mean when they talk about how
many,

532
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,280
how much calories you can hold from
glycogen stored in the liver and all the

533
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:21,400
carb loading you can do versus how much
fat you have on your body.

534
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,980
You could run for days.
That's why we confessed.

535
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,380
It's literally why.
That's another thing like to dispel a

536
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:30,820
bodybuilder myth on muscle.
If we lost muscle dramatically from

537
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:34,240
fasting,
then how do we chase down the heard

538
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:38,410
three,
four or five days into not having food

539
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,130
like,
right.

540
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:44,130
We for sure evolve to be able to do this
so we could go long periods of time and

541
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,850
have our explosiveness when we needed
it,

542
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,070
you know,
and they weren't jumping on treadmills

543
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:51,020
and doing stupid shit like we have to do
now,

544
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,630
but at the same time,
like it was important for human beings

545
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:57,350
to be able to have energy still in a
fasted state for that long.

546
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,900
And what you're talking about for people
who are unaware,

547
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:03,710
it's called persistence hunting and it's
one of the first methods of hunting that

548
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:08,711
ancient people used to do and still do
in parts of Africa where they'll run and

549
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:11,180
chase down.
Like if an animal like an antelope,

550
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,370
they run very fast for short periods of
time,

551
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:14,960
but they overheat,
they get,

552
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,020
they get hot and they get tired and they
can't run like we can.

553
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:20,360
We can run at a slower pace for way
longer.

554
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,690
We could run all day because we sweat,
they don't sweat.

555
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,070
So they overheat.
And so what ancient hunters would do is

556
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:29,540
just chase them literally until they
dropped and they would stab them.

557
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,930
There's some pretty fucking trippy
videos of guys doing that today in

558
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,430
Africa.
That sounds bad ass.

559
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,160
It's pretty crazy.
They just chase these animals down until

560
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:39,140
eventually they just give up and then
they stab them.

561
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,770
I can't imagine the runner's high have
chasing prey that long.

562
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:43,850
And,
and like your,

563
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,800
that's your food.
It's not like,

564
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,820
Oh hey,
let's spend five grand and go into

565
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,430
safari.
Like that's your food.

566
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,290
You know,
like that must give you the thrill

567
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,143
alive.
Yeah.

568
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,830
Yeah.
I'm gonna bring us back for my family.

569
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,990
This is not something you did while you
were fighting?

570
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,340
No.
Um,

571
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,990
you know,
in fighting at the way I like to word

572
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:05,570
this is a,
I used to play video games and love to

573
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,700
do shit and I'm not knocking video
games.

574
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,820
I'm in a video game coming up here.
It's going to be awesome.

575
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,010
What does the Mafia three by two k
games.

576
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,000
Awesome.
The guy who played like a hitman or some

577
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,140
shit.
I'm the dude.

578
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,060
The dude,
the dude.

579
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,380
It's a one player game that's like a
grand theft auto.

580
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,690
Oh,
but you don't beat up hookers after

581
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,170
banging them.
You do like more a revenge game trying

582
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:32,090
to come after these guys for killing my
family.

583
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,830
Oh.
And I get to do.

584
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,900
I mean the whole thing is motion
capture.

585
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,690
So if you guy farts,
it's me and a suit doing it real.

586
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,610
Anything he does,
it's me doing it.

587
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,900
Wow.
So,

588
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,700
um,
how long did you have to do that for?

589
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,800
We're still working on it.
It's coming out this summer.

590
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,960
It's been,
I've been doing that for since I retired

591
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,710
last year and a half.
It's crazy how intensive video games are

592
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,520
about people working behind it now.
Uh,

593
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,790
grand theft auto,
five grand theft auto five had.

594
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,860
This is,
this is the trailer

595
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,940
mafia three.
Let's see here.

596
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,090
Don't tell,
don't,

597
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:12,090
don't
graphics

598
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,740
videos.
How long has it.

599
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,920
So is this you here with the backpack
dismay the whole way.

600
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,930
I had to do all that shit at the end
here.

601
00:27:17,931 --> 00:27:21,080
I kicked this guy into the creek.
Uh,

602
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,630
the face is different.
It's an actor named Alex from New York.

603
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:26,780
He's awesome.
So the facial scan and the voice

604
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,570
just fucking video.
The video is incredible.

605
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,523
Whoa.

606
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,100
Does it feel bizarre having some dude's
face on your body now?

607
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,590
Because I've met him and he's awesome.
If he was a Douche then I would look at

608
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:01,630
it totally different.
But I love the guy.

609
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,550
He's awesome.
That would suck.

610
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,960
The fucking video.
Graphics are insane.

611
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,140
This is really downplayed too,
just because it's the youtube,

612
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,120
like when you,
when I go in the studio and see what

613
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:15,640
they've done with it and you get to play
the game,

614
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,560
the end game is just,
it's,

615
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,060
it's,
they have whole teams that do the

616
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:20,890
environment,
whole teams that do buildings,

617
00:28:20,891 --> 00:28:23,410
everything you can go into.
There's not a door in the game that you

618
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:27,100
can't walk into and have some type of
environment to play with.

619
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,780
Just like the hair and the,
the grass when they were in nom,

620
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,580
they're flying with the helicopters,
so they look at the fucking grass,

621
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:36,550
the shadows,
and this is incredible.

622
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,420
The facial recognition is the same stuff
that Robert Zemeckis was using in his

623
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:44,110
movies when they walk in.
We flew to La to do it.

624
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,423
It's pretty.

625
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,593
Yeah.

626
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,990
Soundtrack.
Yeah.

627
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,360
Well it's late sixties,
early seventies officers.

628
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:57,410
Some good music to choose from.
This is awesome,

629
00:28:57,411 --> 00:29:00,080
man.
Wow.

630
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:05,380
Well we get fucking some nights gory
kills for people that are into that sort

631
00:29:05,591 --> 00:29:06,424
of thing.

632
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,003
Wow.

633
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,490
Yeah.
It's amazing how like if you want to

634
00:29:13,491 --> 00:29:16,790
talk about people that work hard,
nobody works like why don't say nobody,

635
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,220
but they work some insane fucking long
hours,

636
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:20,960
man.
Putting together a video game with some

637
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:23,000
really time intensive stuff.
It's.

638
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,230
Yeah,
and it's around the clock.

639
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,910
Yeah.
You see these guys when I go,

640
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,510
when I go to the MOCAP studio,
it's real laid back the same place.

641
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:31,910
They do like the web game and the
basketball game,

642
00:29:31,911 --> 00:29:34,700
that kind of thing.
But when you go in and you see the guys

643
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:38,000
that write the code and actually make
the game,

644
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,350
the,
these,

645
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,900
you can tell like they're,
if they're on a deadline,

646
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,930
get you're having to fix bugs and do all
kinds of things and there's just a

647
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:45,970
grind.
Like they're definitely putting in

648
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,800
extreme hours.
Yeah,

649
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,530
it's horrific.
But what I was getting to before I

650
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,690
jumped off on the side there was in,
in fighting,

651
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:58,780
I always had.

652
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,613
I had,
uh,

653
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,600
an idea of what I could do with my time
and if I had a fight coming up and I'm

654
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:08,320
playing video games,
there's nothing like a deadline of this

655
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:10,930
guy's gonna try to knock me out in six
weeks,

656
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,940
five weeks,
four weeks,

657
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,060
three weeks,
every day you start to look at that day,

658
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:18,610
at the end of the day and say,
what did I do today to make myself

659
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:20,740
better?
How did I spend my time?

660
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,850
And if my pie chart had three hours of
entertaining myself,

661
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:28,060
when it could have been learning about
something else to help me,

662
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:30,310
like nutrition or different training
modalities,

663
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:31,720
that kind of thing.
I mean,

664
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:34,240
the choice was made.
I'll just overnight it was like,

665
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:35,860
okay,
I'm done playing video games.

666
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,470
I have a playstation three just
collecting dust.

667
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:40,780
I don't have a new jet.
Next generation I'll probably get one

668
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,070
just to play this game.

669
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,410
But um,
yeah,

670
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:48,100
that really instilled in me a love and a
thirst for knowledge.

671
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,550
And that's when I started reading about.
I've read more books in my fight career

672
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:54,420
than I ever did in college.
That's interesting ever.

673
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,890
I mean,
I have these camps where that's really

674
00:30:56,891 --> 00:31:01,840
how I'd spend my time is just trying to
figure out how to better myself for the

675
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:04,240
flight.
When you were in a strange position too,

676
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:07,660
because you were a guy who came to
martial arts sort of late in life,

677
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,180
so you came into it late in life as a
great athlete who's learning all the

678
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:15,640
different aspects of mma,
all the different martial arts

679
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:20,260
techniques and then competing in the
highest level of the sport,

680
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,820
like pretty much right away.
Yeah,

681
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:22,654
that was pretty dumb.

682
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,790
It could have gotten a lot smarter,
but yeah,

683
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,240
it could have gotten a lot,
lot more intelligently planning a career

684
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:34,150
and things like that,
but really it just all happened by

685
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:35,130
storm.
You know?

686
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,680
I agree that that's not the way to do
it,

687
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,340
but some people can.
John Jones,

688
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,700
you know,
there's a few guys that.

689
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:43,534
Can.
I look at,

690
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,560
talk about Jon Jones or a guy like
Daniel cormier.

691
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:50,230
You look at the wrestling background.
It's not like they were doing something

692
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,600
totally different in martial arts the
whole time,

693
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,000
whether you want to call it that or not.
They're in martial arts their whole

694
00:31:55,001 --> 00:32:00,001
lives and then now they can focus on,
I mean look at corn maze has striking

695
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,140
because he didn't have to focus on.
He didn't have to spend time dividing up

696
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:07,510
that pie chart into wrestling practice
and other things.

697
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,670
Right.
You know,

698
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,490
just a little bit.

699
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,070
We'll keep them sharp there,
but I can really learn these other

700
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:13,990
things and dive into them.
What's also,

701
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:18,610
when you are a master at one of those
things like sort of how Damien Maia is,

702
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:22,870
would you Jitsu such a master at it that
all those other things,

703
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,590
you know,
he,

704
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,470
he just has to be proficient enough so
he can get you in a position where he

705
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:29,530
could use his mastery.
Even look at Verdugo is striking is

706
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,710
really improved over the years because
he always had jujitsu moves back.

707
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,210
Exactly,
exactly.

708
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:37,450
And had it on such a high level than
anybody he gets to the ground with is

709
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:39,530
pretty fucked.
You're in a real bad spot,

710
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,490
but your,
your path was the path of the ultimate

711
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:45,110
fighter.
You know,

712
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,430
that TV show and like in not even
eating,

713
00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:53,090
not just people that are on the TV show,
but people that do well in the smaller

714
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:53,900
circuit,
you know,

715
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,760
smaller shows and then,
you know,

716
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:58,010
they get a couple of fights under their
belt and they start looking good and

717
00:32:58,011 --> 00:32:59,470
then they get the call,
you know,

718
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,920
hey,
we need a fight.

719
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,920
Someone needs to um,
fight this guy on,

720
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,140
you know,
three weeks notice you willing to do

721
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:07,560
this.
That's how a lot of guys getting into

722
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:09,900
the UFC fall outs.
You know,

723
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,380
someone from another organization looks
attractive.

724
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:13,790
They've got something going on,
like,

725
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,100
this guy's got potential.
But to,

726
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,030
to engineer a career correctly,
you would do it the swim,

727
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,870
the sort of the same way they did with
floyd mayweather in boxing or someone

728
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:24,800
along those lines.

729
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,500
You would take them slowly through the
amateur ranks,

730
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,000
develop their skills and then test them
a little bit more,

731
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:34,820
every fight a little bit more.
Give them some fights where they can

732
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:37,310
work on some things.
Give him a guy who was a brawler.

733
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,620
Give them a guy who's a box.
Everybody's feather fisted.

734
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,920
Give them a guy who you know,
who's he hits really hard,

735
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:46,880
but he fades after two or three rounds
and there's all these different sorts of

736
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:51,340
tests that you can give a boxer and know
when they're ready for those tests were

737
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,150
the whole time they're getting their
cages to or reading time in,

738
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,740
getting all that butterflies out.
They're spending more time in the pocket

739
00:33:57,741 --> 00:34:02,741
and inside the old telephone poll booth
up with you.

740
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:05,150
They just fucking put your ass in a
catapult.

741
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,970
Launched you into the deepest part of
the ocean.

742
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,670
It was quick.
Yeah.

743
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,160
Was doubt.
That was never a plan though,

744
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:15,600
right?
It was like something that's Sorta came

745
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:16,770
along.
Well,

746
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,440
football ended at Asu and I was pretty
depressed.

747
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:21,870
I didn't know what I wanted to do.
I knew I didn't want to have it fucking

748
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:23,670
desk job.
And uh,

749
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,120
athletics were really my outlet in life,
you know,

750
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,850
I hadn't discovered psychedelics or
meditation or any of that stuff.

751
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,890
Sorry.
So inappropriate.

752
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,000
No worries.
I had turned it up just so I could hear

753
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:36,090
you.
So,

754
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:38,530
um,
but what led you to,

755
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:40,830
um,
I started training in mixed martial arts

756
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,710
just because I was tired of being a rat
on the wheel,

757
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,570
you know,
treadmills and lifting weights wasn't

758
00:34:45,571 --> 00:34:50,250
doing it for me and 26.
Wow.

759
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,100
No martial arts at all before that.
Uh,

760
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:57,210
I mean I wrestled in high school,
so high school wrestling background ball

761
00:34:57,211 --> 00:34:58,150
for years,
uh,

762
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,700
three years in,
two years in junior high.

763
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,150
I was decent,
not great but um,

764
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,480
but yeah,
so we got into it and then uh,

765
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,560
as I was learning,
there was a local guy down in Arizona

766
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,220
and he ran it like a little sleazy
organization down there and he was like,

767
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:14,641
Hey,
you know,

768
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:17,550
you're big.
And he looked good and I know you played

769
00:35:17,551 --> 00:35:20,190
football at Asu.
Why don't you get in there and fight for

770
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:20,840
me?
And I was like,

771
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,830
I don't know man.
I fought a lot growing up.

772
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:25,830
But it's different.
It's different when you are in the

773
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:28,700
moment and you want to destroy someone
versus some guy who was trained for you,

774
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:30,520
you've never met before.
It's like,

775
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,490
do it,
get your feet wet.

776
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:34,200
If you like it,
do it again.

777
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:35,520
If you don't like it,
never do it again,

778
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:36,870
but at least try one time.
Right.

779
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:37,980
It's like,
okay.

780
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,400
So my first fight,
it was a 29 second victory.

781
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,670
Second fight was the 19 second victory,
both knees to the stomach off of like

782
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,430
three months in Muay Thai training.
And then from there I was,

783
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,270
looked like you knock a guy out,
you know,

784
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,300
that is fucking,
there's no drug like that.

785
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,200
I mean,
you're just like,

786
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,640
just lit up on fire.
And then I started training and really

787
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,320
trying to get more serious about it,
but I fought a lot of fights quickly.

788
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,740
So there was no development in between.
I got to five.

789
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,100
No,
inside five months.

790
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,990
I'm six zero a sign with the king of the
cage after that.

791
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,893
And then,
uh,

792
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,510
yeah,
I was getting $100 a fight.

793
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,520
My first fight fights.
Wow.

794
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,361
And then,
uh,

795
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:20,370
I got a thousand dollars a fight and
king of the cage.

796
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:21,800
And,
uh,

797
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,180
after I took my first loss I was still
training out,

798
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:27,900
kind of doing my own thing in Arizona,
so before Bader and those guys had their

799
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:32,670
own gym and so cain was at ak and I'm
from the bay area.

800
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,640
I was born and raised there,
so it just made sense.

801
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:37,410
Like I knew came from college,
but I didn't,

802
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,960
we weren't pals or anything,
I just knew him when I was playing

803
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:41,220
football and he was wrestling.
I was like,

804
00:36:41,221 --> 00:36:41,731
oh,
it has to.

805
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:45,380
Heavyweight wrestler I hear is bad dude.
And then when I heard he was at k

806
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:50,390
already and you already had cost check
Swick Fitch Thompson Aka was already

807
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:51,810
Aka,
you know,

808
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:52,151
and,
and,

809
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:53,880
uh,
frank shamrock had already been there.

810
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,460
Bob Cook had an in with the UFC,
that kind of thing.

811
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:59,910
So it just made sense to move home and
start training their full time.

812
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:02,490
And that's what I did.
And within I think six months they got

813
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:05,160
me on the ultimate fighter season eight
and the rest is history.

814
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,550
Wow.
Do you ever think of it like,

815
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:10,230
man,
if I had to do it all again differently,

816
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,190
how I would do it slower,
I would,

817
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,600
would take my,
there's a million changes I could have

818
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,460
made to it,
but in the end

819
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,890
I'm,
I'm really happy with what fighting gave

820
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:23,724
me.

821
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,310
Fighting brought me.
It just,

822
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,330
I mean I can't say like,
oh,

823
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,100
I give this all,
all the credit here,

824
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,830
but that doorway opened up other
doorways and those doorways open up

825
00:37:32,831 --> 00:37:37,831
other doorways to me and that really was
a catalyst for me having just deep peace

826
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,180
inside,
you know,

827
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:44,180
and all these things came from that one
little bead in fighting,

828
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,040
you know,
like wanting to do better for myself

829
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:50,400
because the guy was going to punch me
meant learning about meditation,

830
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:54,000
learning about breathwork,
learning about just getting more to

831
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:54,780
life,
you know?

832
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,780
And then,
oh okay,

833
00:37:55,781 --> 00:37:58,290
hey,
the psychedelics can be a teacher as

834
00:37:58,291 --> 00:37:59,000
well,
you know,

835
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,560
those kinds of things all kind of came
to me in,

836
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:05,610
in that same timeline.
So it was sort of like the,

837
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,770
not necessarily anxiety,
but the urgency of knowing that you had

838
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:14,430
to prepare for combat,
that you're constantly trying to better

839
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:18,150
yourself because the consequences of not
doing that are so grave that it sort of

840
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:20,880
like ignited this fuel for improvement
in you.

841
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:21,631
Yeah.
I was like,

842
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:23,280
what the fuck did I do today?
You know,

843
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,540
like you look back at the end of the
day,

844
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:25,500
like,
what did I do today?

845
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,820
Did I do anything to make me better than
I,

846
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,900
you know,
like it's one thing to be a lot of guys

847
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:31,391
are like,
hey,

848
00:38:31,391 --> 00:38:33,210
it only went to the gym twice a train
hard.

849
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,280
I got a massage.
That was my recovery.

850
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,240
I'm good,
I'm good with watching TV and just

851
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:39,220
vegging out and doing whatever.
And that's fine if you're.

852
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:42,460
I mean when you're beat sometimes you
just need to entertain yourself and

853
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:46,330
relax and that's fine too.
But you know that that just fueled

854
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,910
reading.
I'm really became like where I'm going

855
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:51,610
to read and in meditation,
but meditation,

856
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,910
I was like a lot of people.
I didn't get it for a very long time.

857
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:58,390
I just kind of forced myself to do it
and over time we've got a little easier,

858
00:38:58,391 --> 00:39:03,130
but it wasn't until Iowaska that I
really understood meditation and now

859
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:06,130
with Wim Hoff,
I mean he's just added a whole nother

860
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:09,280
layer to meditation for me that I didn't
have before.

861
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,400
Same thing with my wife.
I mean the Wim Hof breathing techniques

862
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:14,290
are just.
They're phenomenal.

863
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,630
Yeah.
He's incredible.

864
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,370
I can't say enough good stuff about that
guy.

865
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,980
He's a fascinating character to.
You know,

866
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,070
what he's been able to do.
It was like the swimming underwater on

867
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:27,190
the blocks of ice,
the in the frozen ocean.

868
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,950
One hundred yards.
We're supposed to swim 50 and he missed

869
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:34,210
the whole and he doubled his distance
and then frozen retinas fucking g

870
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,000
couldn't see because eyeballs froze like
what?

871
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,940
God dammit.
He's incredible.

872
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,940
He's a very unusual human,
but a lot of people use that method.

873
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:44,140
Now,
that method of breathing,

874
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:48,640
I use it before go on stage.
I take these big crazy wim hoff breaths

875
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,840
before I go onstage.
There's something to in letting go.

876
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,700
Yeah.
The way in let her go.

877
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,090
Yeah.
He's.

878
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,810
He's quite a character.
Matt and he's quite a quite an

879
00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:00,100
inspirational guy too.

880
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,910
There's a lot of people that have really
gravitated towards him.

881
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:06,850
His story was amazing and I've heard him
on Ferris.

882
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:11,620
I heard them on up in greenfields
podcast when you've had them on and you

883
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:13,150
correct beers.
He opened up,

884
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,550
you know what I'm saying?
Like you could tell he got comfortable.

885
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,450
You could get more from him than the
vice docket and I love vice,

886
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:22,060
but I thought the vice documentary,
it was shit 40 minutes.

887
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:25,220
This guy is fixing his fucking hair and
I can't tell if people are following

888
00:40:25,221 --> 00:40:28,150
because he's so charismatic or not like
no dude.

889
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,910
That face,
that feeling is believing,

890
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:32,890
right?
The second you feel that charge and your

891
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:35,440
hands three,
four or five rounds deep,

892
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,970
you know,
like he's not full of shit.

893
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,010
Like you're feeling cheat,
you're feeling energy,

894
00:40:39,011 --> 00:40:41,980
you're feeling what you can label it
whatever you want,

895
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:42,700
but I mean you do.

896
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,310
You feel good inside.
That's undeniable.

897
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,440
Well,
inspiration is,

898
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,540
is a type of fuel,
right?

899
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:51,640
I mean when you get inspired,
you fire up.

900
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:54,910
You literally can feel yourself getting,
getting pumped.

901
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:55,560
Right?
Well,

902
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,640
what is that?
If you hear a great song,

903
00:40:57,641 --> 00:41:00,820
were you working out and you're like,
and you just get fucking pumped.

904
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,160
That's a real thing.
Whatever that is,

905
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,220
like whatever that is,
whatever the feeling that you get that

906
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:09,910
comes along with inspiration,
like whether it's a great movie or a

907
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:12,970
great song or something that just really
gets you.

908
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,830
That energy is real.
You know Israel,

909
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,410
where the person's coming from.
Well that's thousands of years.

910
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,250
People have discussed it and know some
people,

911
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,520
oh,
that's woo shit,

912
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:27,400
or what are you going to tell me what my
fucking aura looks like?

913
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,670
I can't see your fucking whore of,
but I do believe we had this energy

914
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:33,800
field and fact there's,
there's books and there's science that

915
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:34,280
backness.

916
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,250
Now I'm Valerie Hunt wrote a infinite
mind.

917
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:41,210
She was a professor at Ucla and they
actually have a place in Ucla where they

918
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:44,960
can conduct studies on the human energy
field and they've mapped this out by

919
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:48,560
changing things.
The electromagnetism they can make

920
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:53,561
people have emotional breakdowns,
lose complete loss of motor control like

921
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:56,480
they have just all of a sudden they have
to sit.

922
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,850
That can't even stand the kid keep
themselves up,

923
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,650
but how are they doing it?
Like with like they're manipulating

924
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,720
through ion?
No,

925
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:02,961
no,
no.

926
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:05,810
That's like a metal to get a giant metal
room,

927
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:09,110
some type of special room that they have
them go in and uh,

928
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:13,910
they just change this thing on a dial
and the field influences your human

929
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:15,350
energy field.
Whoa.

930
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,260
And it's fucking verified that did this
a while ago too.

931
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,950
That's as crazy as it's like they've
known about this seventies,

932
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:23,720
eighties for sure.

933
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,690
This is an incredible radiolab podcast
where,

934
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:27,790
um,
uh,

935
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,040
they,
they put electrodes on this woman,

936
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:35,450
they center through this sniper training
video game thing that they do where you

937
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:38,690
have like a rifle and a,
there's a video game in front of you and

938
00:42:38,691 --> 00:42:41,030
presented with all these different
scenarios,

939
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:43,640
like a hostage takeover.
This terrorist show up.

940
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:46,610
They start shooting at you and you tried
to shoot the terrorist under duress,

941
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:47,450
you know,
you're stressed out.

942
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:51,020
And so they take her through this thing.
She does terrible.

943
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,850
Just her.
Everything's off,

944
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,330
just panicky everything.
And then they do it when they attach

945
00:42:57,331 --> 00:43:00,770
these electrodes tour and stimulate with
electricity.

946
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,270
Parts of her head just on the outside,
like transdermally.

947
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:07,940
I think it's where they doing electrical
stimulation.

948
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:10,760
Certain frequencies when they're trying
to manipulate frequency or it was just

949
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:12,860
trying to work like on frontal lobe or
things like that.

950
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,860
I don't know.
I don't know the exact science behind

951
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:20,420
it,
but she then did it and went like 10 for

952
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:21,680
10,
like killed everybody.

953
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:24,140
Like it was insane.
Like her accuracy went through the roof.

954
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:27,560
Now the kids doing this shit where they
try to make their own at a battery

955
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,240
packs.
Like,

956
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:31,940
Hey,
this is all new science and has been

957
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:34,100
doing this for decades.
We don't know what the ramifications

958
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:36,560
are.
That was the Radiolab podcast sort of

959
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:37,790
focused on some of those people.
Like,

960
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:39,500
oh well I went deaf for a couple of
days.

961
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:43,940
Like fuck you do in your head man,
because they're just taking like nine

962
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:48,620
volt batteries and like taping wires to
their skull and juicing themselves.

963
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:52,370
No fucking clue what they're doing.
If there's something going on and they,

964
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,180
the researchers that are working on it,
I think that they can accentuate

965
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:56,900
learning.

966
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,340
They can accentuate flow states where
you get into some sort of a zen moment

967
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,710
guaranteed if you're familiar with
binaural beats,

968
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,544
right?
Yes.

969
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,550
So a binder that's something that for in
the 19 fifties,

970
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:15,620
they wanted to see what a sound sound
wave therapy could do and things like

971
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:16,401
that.
And basically,

972
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:19,250
um,
so you would wear headphones or earbuds

973
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,960
and the basic concept,
the premise would be I can play

974
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:27,890
something at eight Hertz through your
left and 12 hertz through your right.

975
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:30,290
And your brain will match them in the
middle at 10 hertz.

976
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,040
10 Hertz is the

977
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,840
frequency of Alpha waves.
So our brain produces a wide variety of

978
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:41,190
different waves from zero point five
delta when you're in deep sleep all the

979
00:44:41,191 --> 00:44:43,170
way up to Beta state,
which we're in right now,

980
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,980
drinking coffee and thinking.
In between that you have an Alpha state

981
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,170
which is closer to the earth's
residents,

982
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:52,950
the earth's magnetic field where that's
like a meditative state.

983
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,850
So you could have a flow state there.
And Rob Marcus has spoken about this,

984
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,790
um,
that is the flow state range between

985
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:02,610
like seven point eight to 11,
somewhere in there.

986
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,490
Then below that deep meditation,
state of state,

987
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:07,890
pre sleep,
and then delta and,

988
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:12,150
and there's other other things in there,
but basically through a binaural beats

989
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:14,790
you put on these headphones,
you can listen to whatever,

990
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,790
uh,
the ocean or rain or any of these things

991
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:21,540
and you would have these different
frequencies playing through your years

992
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,910
in,
in that you basically trick your brain

993
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,380
into producing these brainwaves.

994
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,230
And within minutes you feel like,
oh,

995
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:30,360
I just took a really nice nap.
Like I feel good,

996
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,680
I feel refreshed,
that kind of thing.

997
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,930
Wow.
That would probably be great if you were

998
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,850
in like a pool tournament or something
like that.

999
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,760
Like something where you want us to get
into zones and get in the zone.

1000
00:45:38,761 --> 00:45:42,990
Like I would think like archery or darts
or something where you just like,

1001
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,190
or,
or three pointers,

1002
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:45,450
you know,
shooting three pointers.

1003
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:50,040
We just get into that field [inaudible],
whatever that is,

1004
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,010
whatever that flow state is.
Oh,

1005
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,550
you're thoughtless.
Basically,

1006
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:55,190
you know,
when you're in the Beta state that's,

1007
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,590
you were thinking,
your mind is racing.

1008
00:45:56,591 --> 00:45:59,290
That I was in the Beta state two nights
ago when I,

1009
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:03,870
when I had three hours of sleep thinking
of all these possible possible rabbit

1010
00:46:03,871 --> 00:46:05,760
holes,
we'd go down to conversation wise.

1011
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,501
Yeah.
That's,

1012
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:07,940
uh,
that,

1013
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,190
that state of the lack of sleep state
is,

1014
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:13,290
uh,
my shittiest thinking state.

1015
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:17,310
I come up with my worst thoughts when
I'm exhausted or can't turn the mind

1016
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:19,140
off.
A lot of people have that issue.

1017
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,060
Yeah.
Well the,

1018
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:24,120
um,
there's also like some silly creative

1019
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:26,640
ideas though that come up when you're
exhausted.

1020
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:30,210
Like sometimes when I'm exhausted I'll
say the most ridiculous shit and it'll

1021
00:46:30,211 --> 00:46:32,970
turn out to be funny.
Like I have to write it down.

1022
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,350
Like where I'm like,
you know,

1023
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,170
the writers on news radio,
the Sitcom I was back in the day,

1024
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,590
they used to stay up late on purpose.
They wouldn't start writing until two or

1025
00:46:40,591 --> 00:46:44,730
three in the morning and they would get
themselves into like an exhausted stupor

1026
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:48,030
and then they would start writing
because all the running would be like

1027
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:51,360
really hilariously silly because they
were just fucking falling asleep.

1028
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:55,020
They were just there just out of it.
Like there's a state that you get that a

1029
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:59,040
lot of writers to try to trick
themselves into just by like getting

1030
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:00,400
exhausted.
Yeah.

1031
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:03,240
It makes sense.
So when you were,

1032
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,600
when you're fighting,
like what was the first sort of

1033
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:11,340
improvement path that you started upon
diet nutrition right off the bat.

1034
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:12,570
That was the one where I was like,
Hey,

1035
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:16,200
this is something I can control.
It'll help me just recovery,

1036
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:18,120
you know,
how do I recover faster?

1037
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,060
How do I flush metabolic waste?
Um,

1038
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,340
yeah,
there really was it.

1039
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,930
I mean,
I've always been into supplements.

1040
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:26,910
I read the muscle mag since I was a
little kid.

1041
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,830
That kind of thing.
And uh,

1042
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,010
certain

1043
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,510
stuff works,
a lot of stuff doesn't.

1044
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,800
But really,
um,

1045
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,440
what you put in your body has a huge
impact.

1046
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:38,290
I mean,
anybody who's ever cleaned up their diet

1047
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:41,140
and felt differently from it.
When you're listening to red band

1048
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:43,480
talking about the wage loss and how he
has the energy now,

1049
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,950
it just feels happy at it.
Like,

1050
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,960
right.
Well that's in rainmaker also.

1051
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:51,850
He talks about 80 percent of our
serotonin is made in our guts bacteria.

1052
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,660
Eighty percent of our feel good hormone
is made in our guts by bacteria.

1053
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,150
And that's great.
What are you saying?

1054
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,710
Yeah.
How do you think food does it impact

1055
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:02,860
that?
We know every cell of our body is made

1056
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:04,690
from what we put in.
So a lot of people don't think,

1057
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:06,130
oh,
he eat this doughnut and it'll just.

1058
00:48:06,131 --> 00:48:08,860
My body will change it into what it
needs to be changed into bullshit.

1059
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,810
No.
And on top of that,

1060
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:13,740
you influence the microbiome,
but what you put in your body,

1061
00:48:13,741 --> 00:48:15,520
if you putting good stuff,
it's easy to see like,

1062
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:16,750
yeah,
of course you feel better.

1063
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,310
Yeah.
We like to think of ourselves as

1064
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:21,040
independent from our food,
but were actually made out of our food.

1065
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,210
That's completely.
I was uh,

1066
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,240
I had salmon the other night at a
restaurant and um,

1067
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,290
I said to my friend,
I said to Tony,

1068
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,300
Tony Hinchcliffe,
I was like,

1069
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,470
I don't think this is wild salmon.
And he said,

1070
00:48:32,471 --> 00:48:32,951
why?
I said,

1071
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,990
because it's too light.
It's too light colored.

1072
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,630
I don't,
I don't,

1073
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,420
you know,
they said it's a wild line caught

1074
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:39,760
salmon.
And I'm like not really buying it.

1075
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,380
And uh,
I said,

1076
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,230
you know,
when you see wild salmon,

1077
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:45,580
it's more of a dark orange.
And he said,

1078
00:48:45,581 --> 00:48:46,301
well,
why is that?

1079
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:46,721
I said,
well,

1080
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:47,920
it's actually because of what they eat.

1081
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:51,310
It's come on bugs like certain bugs that
they eat or shrimp.

1082
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,730
What the fuck is it shrimper bugs find
on West Santa Ana.

1083
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,040
Read,
ask,

1084
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,190
ask,
ask,

1085
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,330
ask,
ask.

1086
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:02,380
US has sustained,
and I know I'm butchering this asks us

1087
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:07,381
strengthen.
It's like a and t h I n s sold in

1088
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:09,670
supplements.
Sockeye Salmon,

1089
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,860
a salmon flush due to their diet.
Sam,

1090
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:13,840
again,
99 percent or more of their body mass

1091
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:15,070
and the ocean,
the foods they eat,

1092
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:15,490
but blah,
blah,

1093
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:19,720
blah.
I'm the food they eat in the ocean is

1094
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:23,650
high and carotenoids the same pigment
that gives carrots color.

1095
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,390
These pigments are stored in their
flesh.

1096
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:28,990
A salmon approaches their spawning
grounds begin to absorb the scales.

1097
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,853
Huh?

1098
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:34,690
Huh?
They begin to absorb their scales.

1099
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:37,810
A weird.
They,

1100
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:38,830
um,
they get mushy.

1101
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:41,320
Have you ever caught a caught a salmon
when it's dying?

1102
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:42,940
Banners.
We went into,

1103
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:46,150
I had a bachelor party.
My buddy goes up every year to Alaska,

1104
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,880
so we went fishing off the Kenai river,
but we were,

1105
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:53,530
we just fit it in before his wedding,
so we were about a month or two late to

1106
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:57,490
the party.
It was a feast for Seagulls,

1107
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:02,650
like all these old timers that spawned
and they're like swimming along,

1108
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:06,160
like just fucking,
just full layers of skin and scale is

1109
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:08,860
just floating off of them ready to die.
Yeah.

1110
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:11,530
They become mushy.
Their flesh is like difficult to eat

1111
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:12,640
too.
It's like disgusting.

1112
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:13,570
Yeah,
it's nasty.

1113
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:15,670
Like you could eat it if you have to,
if you want to stay alive,

1114
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,090
but they're literally breaking down and
had a little sashimi and that was a.

1115
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:22,390
That was a mistake for sure.
You should never eat salmon Sashimi.

1116
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:23,440
Really?
Yeah.

1117
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,260
Yeah.
It's not a smart move because they have

1118
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:30,740
parasites,
ocean fish or much better in regards to

1119
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:31,400
uh,
being.

1120
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,230
So if you caught the salmon in the
ocean,

1121
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,210
you're cool to do it.
Then he even then,

1122
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:37,730
because they go there,
they go back and forth.

1123
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:42,140
I think is something about fresh water
fish are much more susceptible to,

1124
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,060
um,
southern nasty shit we put in there

1125
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,710
probably.
Yeah.

1126
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,050
I don't even know if it's nasty shit we
put in there.

1127
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:53,051
I think that's just nature.
I think fish in the ocean naturally are

1128
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:58,640
of a higher,
less likely hood of a contracting.

1129
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:02,750
Any sort of parasites or you have a
higher likelihood of getting it from.

1130
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:06,440
I'm a freshwater fish.
Like you should never eat like large

1131
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:08,630
mouth bass.
Like Sashimi.

1132
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:09,543
You shouldn't eat that.

1133
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,680
I don't think.
I really don't think I'm talking out of

1134
00:51:12,681 --> 00:51:14,040
my ass here.
I'm pretty sure of.

1135
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,400
I've read that you're not supposed to
eat salmon Sushi,

1136
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,370
but people do.
Yeah.

1137
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,400
People do and it doesn't.
But anyway,

1138
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:27,580
point being this fish was really kind of
Pale and then we were talking about like

1139
00:51:27,981 --> 00:51:32,450
how weird it is that your food actually
changes the color of your skin.

1140
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:37,730
And we were talking about black bears
that eat blackberries and blueberries,

1141
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,010
like if you eat,
um,

1142
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:39,933
they,
they,

1143
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:45,070
like certain hunters will go after bears
that are in the fall because the fall

1144
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:49,640
bears the gorge on blueberries and their
flesh is just supposed to be

1145
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:52,730
unbelievably delicious.
Like some of the best tasting meat you

1146
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:57,731
can get because they're their flesh.
And then their fat itself is like a

1147
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:03,671
purple color from all the blueberries.
Like it changes their actual physical

1148
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:07,350
flesh and it makes it absorb.

1149
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:10,790
It just makes you think about all these
people that are eating McDonald's

1150
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,100
twinkies and shit.
Like what is their flesh?

1151
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,850
It's just high fructose corn Syrup and
Trans Fats.

1152
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:20,190
Just dog shit.
Just pumping through your testimony in

1153
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,730
college.
Just any calories that can get ahold of

1154
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:25,040
just brutal.
Well,

1155
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,590
you know,
ultimately that stuff breaks down the

1156
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:30,770
protein and water and all the various
aspects of it.

1157
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:35,210
But if that's all you eat,
no wonder why so many people are

1158
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:37,910
depressed.
If you look at the modern American Diet,

1159
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,490
you look at the modern American diet,
the sedentary lifestyle,

1160
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,350
and then you look at the fact that
people feel like shit.

1161
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,360
And what is depression?
Well,

1162
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,400
there's all sorts of different kinds of
depression.

1163
00:52:46,401 --> 00:52:48,650
There's some depression that's
absolutely caused by a chemical

1164
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:50,720
imbalance.
Your brain's sick.

1165
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,940
You know,
just like your liver can get sick and

1166
00:52:52,941 --> 00:52:54,860
your lungs can get sick,
your brain can get sick,

1167
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:00,320
but there's a whole lot of depression
that I guarantee has to do with people

1168
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:02,210
with sedentary lifestyle,
Shitty Diet,

1169
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:06,950
and just no,
no real pushing of the body where your

1170
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:09,170
body never gets to flush it out.

1171
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,580
Never gets to blow those hormones up.
Never gets to get that blood pumping

1172
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:14,211
out.
Argue.

1173
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:17,060
The brain gets sick because you let it
get.

1174
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:19,910
That way.
You stop moving and stop putting good

1175
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:22,520
things in your body.
And then you have this downward spiral

1176
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:26,890
that just snowballs into deep depression
that know your buddy coming over and

1177
00:53:26,891 --> 00:53:29,160
it's going to cheer you up.
Whatever it is,

1178
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:32,190
you're not going to snap yourself out of
that just overnight and you're

1179
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:34,410
definitely not going to get it from
popping a pill.

1180
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:36,040
I mean,
you gotta get off your ass and move and

1181
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:38,730
start getting back out in nature.
Yeah.

1182
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,450
To the pill thing is a weird one because
I know for some people it's been very

1183
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:45,300
beneficial.
I know people that were like severely

1184
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:48,060
depressed,
they got an antidepressants and they

1185
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:51,180
eventually wean themselves off,
but they got happy first.

1186
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,160
So it's like,
what?

1187
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,970
Did they need the pills?
No,

1188
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:56,070
but the pills did help them and I
wonder.

1189
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:57,810
I don't,
I'm not going to indicate that at all,

1190
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,550
but I wonder what lifestyle choices did
they make during that process as they

1191
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:04,060
started feeling better?
Like,

1192
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,670
oh,
I feel a little bit better.

1193
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:07,050
Sure,
let's go for a hike.

1194
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,720
Whatever it is.
Like what did they do in addition to

1195
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:10,980
that?
Right.

1196
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,590
That helped them.
So they don't have the pills now,

1197
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,860
right,
because they're off the pills now.

1198
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:18,300
So how do you get to that point where
you can be like a,

1199
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:19,710
I don't need this anymore.
You know what,

1200
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,330
dudes that I know,
one of them,

1201
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:24,300
he got married,
fell in love,

1202
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,600
started his own business,
his business became very successful,

1203
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:30,270
started doing really well in life,
start feeling better about himself,

1204
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,270
and then it all sort of fell together
and then he said,

1205
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,350
you know what,
I'm going to get off these fucking

1206
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:36,150
pills,
and he slowly weaned himself off and

1207
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:41,151
he's still happy and the other one got
successful and got more confident and

1208
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:45,960
then realize that the pills were
probably like dulling his senses and

1209
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:48,600
some sort of way and then slowly weaned
himself off,

1210
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:51,450
but he hasn't really got into a
exercise.

1211
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,550
The other thing he did was he got off
Propecia,

1212
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:58,050
that propecia shit that dudes do to keep
their hair that took that and college

1213
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:01,710
stuff killed my Dick.
Like a CHT blocker.

1214
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:02,750
Right?
Yeah.

1215
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,580
Dht makes you a man,
makes you bald,

1216
00:55:05,581 --> 00:55:07,920
makes you have body hair.
Don't want to get rid of that

1217
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,650
testosterone to get rid of that.
Well,

1218
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,790
it can depress people.
It can cause severe depression.

1219
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,060
Some people,
you know,

1220
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,100
it didn't in me,
but it definitely killed my deck,

1221
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,520
like a gun.
That would make me depressed just right

1222
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:21,400
then.
That's depressing.

1223
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,650
It doesn't totally kill it,
but it's definitely.

1224
00:55:23,651 --> 00:55:26,850
What beats the fuck out of it.
Come on.

1225
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:28,560
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this to me?

1226
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,430
Yeah.
Well they say that you know,

1227
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,200
there's a,
there's a balance that your hormones

1228
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:37,440
achieve and anytime you fuck with that
balance with something like propecia

1229
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:40,710
that you know that blocks
dihydrotestosterone,

1230
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,910
your body's like,
all right,

1231
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:43,200
well what the hell is going on here?

1232
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:44,700
Why is this block like,
what?

1233
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,810
Wha Wha wha,
wha.

1234
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:49,170
What is our issue here?
And it can cause a cascade of issues

1235
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:54,000
like anytime you'd like to,
to treat the body as anything other than

1236
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,970
a holistic approach.
If you have a holistic approach,

1237
00:55:56,971 --> 00:55:58,860
you look at this guy's depressed.
Okay,

1238
00:55:58,861 --> 00:55:59,910
well let's look at his diet.
No,

1239
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:00,210
no,
no,

1240
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:00,511
no,
no.

1241
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,730
We need to get them on a pill.
Well that doesn't make any sense.

1242
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,250
You need to look at the whole thing.
Like what's his diet like?

1243
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,260
How often does he sleep?
What is he?

1244
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:10,140
Does he drink a lot of water?
Does he have something to get over?

1245
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,480
It's something that was fucking his wife
die.

1246
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,010
His Dad's clean.
His Shit.

1247
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,280
You know what's going on there.
There's sometimes you just have to

1248
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,710
overcome.
You just have to overcome a periods of

1249
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,200
life that just suck.
That's,

1250
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,010
that's real too.
You know what I,

1251
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,010
I mean,
people want to

1252
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,970
fix for that.
Uh,

1253
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,940
give me a bill.
I got to get past the stage of life.

1254
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:30,690
Only you're going to sleep through it.
That's everything though with the,

1255
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:33,130
with the Western medicine.
It's just that I'm broken.

1256
00:56:33,131 --> 00:56:34,390
Fix Me.
Let me go.

1257
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,160
You're the professional and fixed my
knee.

1258
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:39,700
My hip pain medicine is the shit though.
If you break your arm,

1259
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,970
they fixed my shoulder when I was a dumb
ass and had a torn labrum.

1260
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,730
I love it for that.
But what would happen to your shoulder

1261
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:49,780
would you do that?
Was overtraining and uh,

1262
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:54,810
decided to try to Max out on barbell
snatch and missed it with it.

1263
00:56:57,541 --> 00:57:00,610
Didn't feel anything there.
Then I waited a minute and reattempted

1264
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,810
the same weight and then I felt like it
just felt like no strength at all.

1265
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:10,020
So it was a full slap tear came to the
same thing it takes for a.

1266
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,650
you're right,
we've just been talking to people that

1267
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:14,830
have shoulder surgery.
I think I thought I had this dumb ass

1268
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:15,850
idea in my head like,
oh,

1269
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:16,960
you know,
I'll be able to run still.

1270
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:17,560
And I'm like,
no,

1271
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,360
you can't do any of that.
I couldn't even walk.

1272
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:23,860
I had to be very careful with my arm in
a sling for at least the first six

1273
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:27,010
weeks.
Then at six months I could start rehab.

1274
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:29,470
It took me a whole year.
We really did.

1275
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,270
And really I give a ton of credit to
Kelly,

1276
00:57:31,271 --> 00:57:34,660
start a for getting full range of motion
back.

1277
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,060
The becoming a supple leopard guy and
like I had for a long period of time

1278
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,290
thought like this is as far as my arm's
going to go.

1279
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,450
Not quite that.
Not Quite Hail Hitler,

1280
00:57:43,451 --> 00:57:45,460
but you know,
like I had no full range of motion.

1281
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,620
I can get my bicep.
Yeah.

1282
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:51,040
Couldn't get my bicep to my ear and I
knew it was short in certain positions.

1283
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:53,650
Like if you get in grappling,
Jujitsu,

1284
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:55,360
wrestling,
things like that guy sprawls while

1285
00:57:55,361 --> 00:57:58,570
you're holding a single leg that's nine,
that three inches makes all the

1286
00:57:58,571 --> 00:58:00,610
difference in the world.
Like from feeling like,

1287
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,320
Hey,
this guy's putting pressure on me,

1288
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:04,510
I should change positions or my arm's
going to snap.

1289
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,620
Right?
That's the difference.

1290
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,080
If you defending,
looked a head and arm choke on the right

1291
00:58:08,081 --> 00:58:09,910
side and someone tries to straighten
your arm out,

1292
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:12,190
what does that like when he presses up
against your head?

1293
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,530
Everything's fine now.
But initially it was a nightmare.

1294
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,071
Yeah.
Like just,

1295
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:17,710
I couldn't get biceps to ear while I'm
talking to you.

1296
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,230
So for sure if someone's trying to do
that to me,

1297
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,120
then it's going to feel like something's
gonna tear

1298
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:26,440
six months before you can start doing
rehab.

1299
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,070
And that was a process that was,
you know,

1300
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:30,990
just nasty.
So,

1301
00:58:30,991 --> 00:58:33,820
um,
I know now listen to my body,

1302
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,250
don't push the envelope,
nothing.

1303
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:37,930
You know?
And then we slap tear.

1304
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,820
What does that mean?
It's an acronym.

1305
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,960
It's the placement of the.
What is it?

1306
00:58:43,961 --> 00:58:46,660
The placement of will.
The labor room is like the,

1307
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,540
it holds this ball in place.
Right.

1308
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,420
So slap is the position of it.
It's on the front side.

1309
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,430
I've,
if I remember correctly,

1310
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:56,350
it was a few years ago,
but um,

1311
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:58,660
yeah,
it's all placement.

1312
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:02,320
All arthroscopic go in there and sew it
back up.

1313
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:03,280
Is that what they did?
Yeah.

1314
00:59:03,281 --> 00:59:05,350
I have very,
very minimal scarring there.

1315
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,210
But yeah,
it's basically what it is.

1316
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,040
They just go in,
they do everything through the,

1317
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,390
through the vision of the,
the little cameras and it's easy.

1318
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:15,610
It's easy fix for them.
And it had a great guy.

1319
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,910
He's worked on tons of NFL guys I got
and I'm grateful that I have full

1320
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,990
recovery,
but really it's,

1321
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,040
it's a nasty deal

1322
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,920
to have to go through.
Yeah.

1323
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:26,480
Tait Fletcher just went through
something like this weekend.

1324
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:29,750
He went through something.
He just texted me about a.

1325
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:30,980
hold on one second.
It,

1326
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:32,720
uh,
it's something called.

1327
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:34,550
This is really interesting shit,
man.

1328
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:40,030
It's okay.
It's called highland highland x

1329
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,820
injections there.
Site injections,

1330
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:49,030
whether impediments to movement and um,
anything they have with sliding tissue.

1331
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:50,654
Oh,
there it is.

1332
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,690
Highland X.
and uh,

1333
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:54,250
he was saying that,
uh,

1334
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:58,190
it's an enzyme and that they're,
they're testing on people that have

1335
00:59:58,191 --> 01:00:03,020
joint issues and somehow or another it's
supposed to mitigate the issues of

1336
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:08,380
mobility in a joint problems.
I think I need to get my dad in that he

1337
01:00:10,171 --> 01:00:12,680
gave.
He can't open his arms as far as his

1338
01:00:12,681 --> 01:00:14,450
arms go.
How come you could arm bar?

1339
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:16,220
I'm like,
the east got like calcium deposits and

1340
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:19,160
shit in his elbows.
He's had surgery on both of them to him.

1341
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,320
From what?
Uh,

1342
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:23,210
you know,
he's,

1343
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:26,060
he's eating cleaner now,
but for years he ate whatever the hell

1344
01:00:26,061 --> 01:00:30,560
he wanted and he still did.
I mean he got his black belt a year ago.

1345
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,210
So he does.
He's on the mat all the time.

1346
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:36,020
He does a lot of Jujitsu.
I'm how old you done?

1347
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,970
Sixty four.
That's amazing.

1348
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:41,150
Gets his black belt at 63.
What a stud.

1349
01:00:41,151 --> 01:00:46,151
He started at 56 dud.
He was a fat loser with a super,

1350
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,740
super stressed job,
you know,

1351
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,250
sales.
And then when I started fighting,

1352
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,880
he got into Jujitsu.
He did full contact karate,

1353
01:00:55,881 --> 01:00:56,960
boxing,
wrestling.

1354
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,170
So he understood,
striking,

1355
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:58,910
understood.
Wrestling,

1356
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,170
but the second hit the mat,
he was like,

1357
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:01,520
I don't know what the fuck these guys
are doing,

1358
01:01:01,521 --> 01:01:04,040
like have to learn.
And uh,

1359
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:06,620
once he started immediately became
addicted.

1360
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,370
Like anybody who does Jujitsu,
you know,

1361
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:11,330
the feeling you get when you first start
and he lost 50 pounds without even

1362
01:01:11,331 --> 01:01:13,280
changing his diet in the first six
months.

1363
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:17,120
So it was a,
it's been a life changer for them for

1364
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:18,590
sure.
That's fucking great.

1365
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,980
I love hearing that.
Like Anthony Bourdain keeps saying he'll

1366
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:25,460
never get his black belt bullshit.
That guy will get his black belt.

1367
01:01:25,461 --> 01:01:28,850
He started when he was,
I think 57 and he's got his blue belt

1368
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,310
now at 58.
He'll get it for sure.

1369
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:33,230
He'll get it.
He's a maniac.

1370
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:37,460
He takes one private and one full class.
One,

1371
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:40,040
one regular class a day everyday,
everyday,

1372
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:43,470
everyday cheese.
Why not if you've got cheese?

1373
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:44,900
Yeah,
he's got the cheese and he's also got

1374
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,580
the obsession.
And you know,

1375
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,680
it's funny,
I talked to Bj Penn about this.

1376
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:53,720
Bj Penn was hilarious about this.
He was talking to this guy and the guy

1377
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:54,630
was like,
you know,

1378
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,030
uh,
he told you no,

1379
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:59,120
because Bj famously got his black belt
in three years and one day,

1380
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,470
one day,
all three years in,

1381
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:03,110
and this guy had gotten his black belt
somewhere,

1382
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:06,110
I think around four years.
And a Bj was like,

1383
01:02:06,111 --> 01:02:06,831
well,
he goes,

1384
01:02:06,831 --> 01:02:07,491
man.
He goes,

1385
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:08,810
you,
you must be really talented.

1386
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:09,950
And he goes,
no,

1387
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:10,641
man.
He goes,

1388
01:02:10,641 --> 01:02:12,260
I'm obsessed.
He goes,

1389
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:13,670
I'm addicted.
Like you,

1390
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,780
I'm addicted.
And bj started laughing.

1391
01:02:15,781 --> 01:02:16,491
He goes,
I realized,

1392
01:02:16,491 --> 01:02:17,480
yeah,
I was addicted.

1393
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:20,130
I was addicted to like,
you can get

1394
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,540
addicted to good things too.
Oh yeah,

1395
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:24,390
no question.
I mean,

1396
01:02:24,391 --> 01:02:24,820
that's,
that,

1397
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,240
that is runners high.
That's why people would sign up for a

1398
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:28,710
race that's,
wait,

1399
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,570
it's not healthy for you to run that
far,

1400
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:34,110
but it feels good training and preparing
and getting your body ready for that.

1401
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:36,280
And that keeps you coming back for more.
Yeah.

1402
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:40,050
Like 100 mile runs.
Those are fucking terrible.

1403
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,990
Destroy you.
They've got to be bad you.

1404
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:45,060
They've done blood work on people even
not just after a marathon,

1405
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:49,410
which is ridiculous in its own right,
but they would see like borderline

1406
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:52,110
kidney failure,
like your kidneys can barely keep up

1407
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:54,000
with removing metabolic waste.
Yeah.

1408
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:57,390
You don't look after those things and
your piss looks like Coca Cola.

1409
01:02:58,830 --> 01:02:59,663
Well,
I'm out.

1410
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,140
I'm out.
No.

1411
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,230
Oh,
never want to get to the point where I p

1412
01:03:03,231 --> 01:03:06,120
looks like coke.
That's fucking terrible man.

1413
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:09,630
But people like they also get addicted
to pushing themselves.

1414
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,010
That's a big one.
You know,

1415
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,340
like my friend Cameron Hanes,
he's a bow hunter,

1416
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:17,090
but he's also does ultra marathons.
A lot of merit.

1417
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,150
He started getting in shape just so he
could get up the mountains easier.

1418
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,900
Like cars in bowhunting.
There's two things that come into play.

1419
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:27,060
One,
you have to be fit in order to get up

1420
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:29,550
the mountains because all that hiking,
it's exhausting,

1421
01:03:29,551 --> 01:03:33,210
especially at high altitude and two,
you have to be strong to be able to pack

1422
01:03:33,211 --> 01:03:34,590
out.
Like you carry an animal,

1423
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,750
you kill it and you have to get it down
in the mountains.

1424
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:40,200
A lot of work.
So those two things led him down this

1425
01:03:40,201 --> 01:03:43,710
road of starting to do marathons and
lifting a lot of weights and doing all

1426
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:46,560
these different things.
But now he's doing ultra marathons.

1427
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,230
He's doing something called the big foot
challenge.

1428
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:53,100
It's 200 miles.
So I go 100 miles a day and the next day

1429
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:54,140
another hundred miles like

1430
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,800
damn,
I wonder what the cutoff is for that

1431
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:00,290
because sometimes they're right around
like 22 hours.

1432
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,930
Just what do you do?
You take an hour nap and then go right

1433
01:04:02,931 --> 01:04:05,150
back to running.
I don't even know if you sleep.

1434
01:04:05,151 --> 01:04:10,151
I mean you probably in so much agony
after 24 hours of running 200 miles.

1435
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:14,500
That's so stupid.
100 wasn't enough guys.

1436
01:04:14,501 --> 01:04:18,830
It's weed out the policies here and they
get 200 some lady in my neighborhood did

1437
01:04:18,831 --> 01:04:19,350
it.

1438
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,180
She.
She did 200 fucking miles.

1439
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:23,700
She did a mile.
One hundred miles one day.

1440
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:24,840
One hundred miles the next day.

1441
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,240
Bitch is crazy.
Yeah.

1442
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:31,570
I say bitch with all due respect
and admiration.

1443
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:32,731
Damn.
Yeah.

1444
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:35,140
I don't.
I don't mean leslie anything wrong with

1445
01:04:35,141 --> 01:04:36,580
her.
She's just tough as shit.

1446
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:39,300
But they get addicted to like pushing
them.

1447
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:43,030
Sounds like there's a thing that comes
to some people when they get involved in

1448
01:04:43,031 --> 01:04:45,880
these heavy endurance races were part of
the.

1449
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:49,330
The addiction is one more hour,
five more miles,

1450
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:50,380
10 more miles.

1451
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:54,480
Just push your kid into a.
You do get into a flow state and it does

1452
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,210
you.
The longer you go,

1453
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,210
the better it feels.
I mean obviously you can deal with

1454
01:04:59,211 --> 01:05:02,090
ticketek injuries and things like that
or whatever you got to deal with in the

1455
01:05:02,091 --> 01:05:05,180
race.
But at a certain point in time the

1456
01:05:05,181 --> 01:05:09,050
mental chatter quiets down and you just
find your rhythm and you find your

1457
01:05:09,051 --> 01:05:12,320
breathing and that's,
that can be meditative completely.

1458
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:15,530
And the longer it goes,
the better for people like that.

1459
01:05:15,531 --> 01:05:17,060
Once you're in that state,
you know,

1460
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:17,621
I mean,
I've,

1461
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:22,621
I've felt that in half marathons on the
last six miles and finish stronger in

1462
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:25,720
the end than I did in the first half.
You know?

1463
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:26,980
And I'm sure runners be like,
oh yeah,

1464
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:30,520
of course we ran more.
You'd know that dummy for that,

1465
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:33,670
that I get that.
So that's why we sign up for this 50 k

1466
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:35,380
coming up just for the fact like,
all right,

1467
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,410
Kelly started a 50 k at 230 pounds.

1468
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:39,320
It can be done.
Right?

1469
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,410
You know,
and I'm not saying I'm going to make a

1470
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:44,260
regular habit of this,
I don't think it's healthy by any means,

1471
01:05:44,261 --> 01:05:46,770
but I do want to do it.
A 50 is like a mile time,

1472
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,040
right?
A marathon is what?

1473
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:53,070
It's a little bit longer to think.
I think a marathon is 26 point two miles

1474
01:05:53,141 --> 01:05:55,450
and a 50 k's run around 33.
Oh,

1475
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:58,350
okay.
That makes sense to point.

1476
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,210
Jamie would know the powers of,
of Google,

1477
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,450
the powers of Google 31 miles.
Jamie's a runner too.

1478
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,273
So,
um,

1479
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,520
that's um,
so is that what fuels your competitive

1480
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:15,460
desires now?
I like doing different things,

1481
01:06:15,461 --> 01:06:18,130
you know,
like working out with Jesse burdick.

1482
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:20,560
He's the guy who does power,
he's a beast.

1483
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:22,110
Uh,
you know,

1484
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:26,860
so training once a week I'll go up and
train with him and Dublin at CSA and we

1485
01:06:26,861 --> 01:06:28,480
do some heavy,
heavy lower body.

1486
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:30,040
It could be anything.
So we'll squat heavy.

1487
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:33,880
One day we'll do a heavy sumo deadlift,
heavy conventional to whatever,

1488
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,020
you know,
like there's just a,

1489
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:41,400
it's good to train with guys that are
way better than you at whatever their

1490
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:43,570
respective thing is,
you know,

1491
01:06:43,571 --> 01:06:46,600
and I feel like I have,
I can go in there and learn from him and

1492
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:49,150
the guys that got working out there.
That doesn't mean a lot of good and I

1493
01:06:49,151 --> 01:06:51,100
love lifting who doesn't want to be
stronger.

1494
01:06:51,101 --> 01:06:52,690
Like if you,
once you get a taste for that,

1495
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:56,530
that is an addictive thing and I love
lifting heavy weight because I feel

1496
01:06:56,531 --> 01:06:58,530
better throughout the week.
You know?

1497
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,340
I just feel better as a person doing
that.

1498
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,120
When I'm in shape,
I feel better being in shape.

1499
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,700
So going for longer distance runs and
having something,

1500
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,320
you know,
if there's light at the end of the

1501
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:09,400
tunnel,
like April ninth,

1502
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:10,360
I'm running the 50 k.

1503
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:13,930
That makes it easy for me to come home
when I'm tired and say I got to get at

1504
01:07:13,931 --> 01:07:15,670
least three miles in today.
That kind of thing.

1505
01:07:15,671 --> 01:07:17,920
You know,
like I know this event's coming up so

1506
01:07:17,921 --> 01:07:20,710
I'm going to put in some roadwork today
and it doesn't fuck with your shoulder

1507
01:07:20,711 --> 01:07:23,470
at all.
This heavy lifting the shoulders.

1508
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,870
A hundred percent know why and I give
full.

1509
01:07:25,871 --> 01:07:28,060
I can't.
I mean it sound like I'm blowing the

1510
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:29,350
guy,
but Kelly start really.

1511
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:31,540
I have everything to thank from that
guy.

1512
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:36,490
What did you do that he will have his
banded mobility and you can look them on

1513
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:41,260
a mobilitywod.com.
He posted 500 videos on youtube.

1514
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:45,340
He's got a shoulder one that's I think
five minutes long and that long,

1515
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:48,520
but he shows eight different stretches
for the shoulder using one of those

1516
01:07:48,521 --> 01:07:49,870
rogue bands.
Right?

1517
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:53,440
And you spent two minutes in a stretch
minimum.

1518
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:56,410
So there's 20,
32nd hold shit is out the window.

1519
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:59,930
He talks about Fascia in order to
release it really has to be,

1520
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,160
have some time under tension and you
know,

1521
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,640
you distract things.
So I couldn't.

1522
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,360
I wouldn't get the same experience if I
put my hand on a wall and try to stretch

1523
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:08,194
my chest.
Right?

1524
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:12,940
But if I can pull in this band,
it distracts the impingement in my

1525
01:08:12,941 --> 01:08:16,280
shoulder and now the Fascia,
the palm of my hand,

1526
01:08:16,281 --> 01:08:20,640
and my thumb will go all the way to my
ear lobe and open up a.

1527
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:23,930
So I'll feel everything the same way a
foam roller can,

1528
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:27,950
can relax my it band right now.
I can get that for my shoulder and all

1529
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:30,650
these different positions.
And that's what gives me my mobility

1530
01:08:30,651 --> 01:08:32,960
back.
So the basic idea is that hey,

1531
01:08:32,961 --> 01:08:35,690
I can be able to get in this position
cold,

1532
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:36,140
right?

1533
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:39,610
That's what I wrote.
He name is booked at supple Leopard

1534
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:41,660
Leopard's.
You don't see them getting up and having

1535
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,880
to do a five minute warmup guys and
catch up with you in a second.

1536
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,060
You know,
they're not,

1537
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:47,030
you know,
I do downward dog upward dog and then

1538
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:48,260
boom,
they're going right.

1539
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:51,770
So I have that ability,
my shoulder now because of putting in

1540
01:08:51,771 --> 01:08:54,380
that work over time.
Well that's what a lot of fighters are

1541
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:56,840
realizing now.
The importance of softness and

1542
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,990
flexibility and,
and just to be pliable and you have to

1543
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:00,880
be mobile.
Yeah,

1544
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:03,770
you have to be mobile.
And to be rigid and stiff,

1545
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,280
it impedes movement,
like I see it a lot from people when

1546
01:09:07,281 --> 01:09:10,490
they're trying to kick.
When I see guys kicking and I see like

1547
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:15,560
stiffness and like sort of a general
lack of fluidity and the way they move,

1548
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:19,220
I can tell immediately I'm like,
this guy's just not flexible enough to

1549
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:20,030
throw on these kicks.

1550
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:22,760
And there's all this resistance from
their supporting leg.

1551
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:26,030
There's resistance from the kicking leg
and then there's resistance from their

1552
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:28,280
torso.
You could see it all as they start

1553
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:32,270
throwing kicks and then the kick will
come up instead of go across the hip,

1554
01:09:32,271 --> 01:09:35,510
won't be high enough.
That won't be as much a forward movement

1555
01:09:35,511 --> 01:09:37,760
with the hip.
Definitely could be mental too though.

1556
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:39,710
You know,
I always looking back,

1557
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,600
honestly on my career,
I fought stiff,

1558
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:43,260
stiff as fuck,
right?

1559
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,110
Like really stiff.
I never sparred.

1560
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:48,920
I never fought the way I sparred.
Rather look at Luke rockhold and I'm

1561
01:09:48,921 --> 01:09:51,080
like,
that guy fights the way he spars.

1562
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,300
Like he doesn't give a fuck what's
coming at him.

1563
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:56,270
He kicks beautiful.
And with everything is thrown is with

1564
01:09:56,271 --> 01:09:57,080
power,
right?

1565
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,080
Yeah.
So he mentally got to that point where

1566
01:10:00,081 --> 01:10:02,150
he was just like,
I know I'm going to destroy you and I'm

1567
01:10:02,151 --> 01:10:03,020
not worried about what you.

1568
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:07,940
How much difference was there with you
with how you performed in the gym versus

1569
01:10:07,941 --> 01:10:10,130
how much you,
how you performed inside the octagon?

1570
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:13,910
The,
I think it was a fairly big difference.

1571
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:16,280
Like a 30 percent difference.
Twenty percent difference.

1572
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:17,880
I don't know how,
if I could put a number on it,

1573
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:19,130
I just felt like,
you know,

1574
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,800
I mean there's.
Hmm.

1575
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:24,010
I mean it's hard to gauge with a guy
like cain.

1576
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,660
Cain destroyed everyone,
you know,

1577
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:26,361
it'd be like,
Oh,

1578
01:10:26,361 --> 01:10:28,040
you know,
there's this time I sparred Kane and I

1579
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:28,940
got them like,
no,

1580
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,710
you can't whoop my ass every time we
spark.

1581
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:34,580
But there was a point in time where I
did well with Daniel.

1582
01:10:34,581 --> 01:10:37,490
Cormier are times where I did well with
Luke rockhold times where I did well

1583
01:10:37,491 --> 01:10:41,210
with Mike Kyle and,
and pull them Otello and you know,

1584
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:45,410
even in my best fights in the UFC,
like with Ricardo Ramiro,

1585
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:46,400
think those.

1586
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,860
The only time I got to get interviewed
by you afterwards,

1587
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:53,600
it took me like a.
The only reason the fight turned out

1588
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:57,500
that way and I was able to get into the
zone was because I was so sick the night

1589
01:10:57,501 --> 01:10:59,410
before.
I fought like two.

1590
01:10:59,411 --> 01:11:01,760
Oh eight.
Like I had fucking sweat the bed.

1591
01:11:01,761 --> 01:11:03,770
I was rolling around in my sweat,
just soaked a bed.

1592
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:08,870
This worst fever I've ever had and in
the fight I'm walking out and I was

1593
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:10,730
guest.
After two minutes of warming up,

1594
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:13,650
I stopped warming up in the in the
locker room completely gassed and I

1595
01:11:13,651 --> 01:11:16,140
thought like,
I'm fucked if this thing goes longer

1596
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:19,380
than men and I'm done.
And then I realized right then Brian,

1597
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:21,900
when they shut the cage door,
I have to fight.

1598
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:26,930
There's nothing I can do here but fight
and right when I made that realization,

1599
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:29,400
that put me in the zone because there
was no thought.

1600
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:33,600
That's why the fight is 23 seconds.
Whatever it was.

1601
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:37,350
It felt like it was in slow motion and I
could never get back to that point

1602
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:41,550
because they didn't have
the technical skills mentally to do it,

1603
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:44,430
or there's the knowhow of how I got
there.

1604
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:45,990
You know,
like I knew I could look back in

1605
01:11:45,991 --> 01:11:47,070
hindsight and say,
yeah,

1606
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:48,330
that's,
this was the catalyst.

1607
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:52,200
I had my back against the wall and I
just completely let go.

1608
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:56,010
I know from Iowasca ceremonies and
things like that,

1609
01:11:56,011 --> 01:12:00,920
like there's a big lesson in letting go
and surrendering to the process is like

1610
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,500
don't fight it.
Just fucking go with uh,

1611
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,000
but those things didn't transfer the way
I had hoped.

1612
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:07,470
You know,
I talked about that before my last

1613
01:12:07,471 --> 01:12:10,170
fight.
I hoped that the lessons I learned from

1614
01:12:10,171 --> 01:12:14,280
Iowasca of surrender would transfer and
I would have this like,

1615
01:12:14,281 --> 01:12:15,720
I don't give a fuck mentality.

1616
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,770
We're going to do this.
And looking back on that fire,

1617
01:12:18,771 --> 01:12:20,310
I didn't.
I was still nervous to show,

1618
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,640
even though looking at photos online and
you know,

1619
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:25,050
pat's going to punch me.
I wasn't afraid of getting punched.

1620
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,260
No offense to pet cummins.
I wasn't afraid of getting punched by

1621
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:32,040
him.
Not after glover and in MANITOWOC and

1622
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:36,000
I'm still like,
I'm squeezing the low fat,

1623
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:37,440
you know,
right as he's about to hit me.

1624
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:39,840
Like I'm stiff,
rigid tents.

1625
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:45,550
So there wasn't a transfer there of,
of skills from the beauty of Iowasca

1626
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,950
because it wasn't,
you didn't know enough time to process

1627
01:12:49,951 --> 01:12:54,951
it or you needed more of those
experiences or there was a really,

1628
01:12:55,261 --> 01:12:56,190
there's a number,
you know,

1629
01:12:56,191 --> 01:12:57,150
there's a large,
large,

1630
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:59,910
there's a.
everything kind of goes together with

1631
01:12:59,911 --> 01:13:00,721
that.
I think,

1632
01:13:00,721 --> 01:13:01,554
um,

1633
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:04,463
really,
you know,

1634
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:08,320
spending time developing yourself
longer,

1635
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:09,460
right?
Having a,

1636
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:13,270
there's no eight week camp where I'm
going to be as good a wrestler is that

1637
01:13:13,271 --> 01:13:14,360
guy,
period.

1638
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:16,850
It doesn't matter who I'm working with.
Um,

1639
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:19,990
that said,
obviously you can build a game plan and

1640
01:13:19,991 --> 01:13:21,910
work on take down a fence and look it
over in.

1641
01:13:21,911 --> 01:13:24,640
St Louis did great against him.
He was an excellent fight.

1642
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:26,710
So I could,
you know,

1643
01:13:26,711 --> 01:13:28,960
like in hindsight maybe it could have
done it like that,

1644
01:13:28,961 --> 01:13:30,430
you know,
maybe I could have had better footwork

1645
01:13:30,431 --> 01:13:32,920
and done these things and worked on
whatever.

1646
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,170
I don't know.
I don't really put too much thought into

1647
01:13:35,171 --> 01:13:39,490
how I could've done that better now
because I have really accepted the fact

1648
01:13:39,491 --> 01:13:41,980
that I'm done doing that.
You know,

1649
01:13:41,981 --> 01:13:45,130
like the more I would put thought into
how I could've done it better,

1650
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:47,030
the more it makes me want to do it.
Right.

1651
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:50,920
Does that make sense?
What was the big deciding factor to make

1652
01:13:50,921 --> 01:13:53,410
you want to retire?
It really,

1653
01:13:53,411 --> 01:13:56,230
really was a,
a number of things.

1654
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:57,064
But

1655
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:00,190
you know,
I had a second job the whole time I was

1656
01:14:00,191 --> 01:14:01,600
in the UFC.
Even with the fight,

1657
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:03,930
the fight of the nights at to fight of
the nights.

1658
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:08,940
I got to train full time for maybe six
months and then the first loss I had to

1659
01:14:10,001 --> 01:14:13,150
go right back to work.
So bouncing at the titty bar,

1660
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:15,760
bartending,
managing that kind of stuff.

1661
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:19,120
And um,
you need sleep for recovery.

1662
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:24,010
And I had that just felt that window of
I can sleep and train full time and know

1663
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:27,220
what it's like to have full recovery now
it's yanked back away from me.

1664
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,410
Why was it yanked back away?
Because you,

1665
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,240
when you lost,
who made less money?

1666
01:14:31,241 --> 01:14:32,170
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

1667
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:33,010
And,
and well,

1668
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,990
with the fracture to like even take for
example,

1669
01:14:34,991 --> 01:14:38,860
when I had a uh,
one of those fights,

1670
01:14:38,861 --> 01:14:42,250
I got fight of the night with Maldonado.

1671
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:45,400
That was my only fight that year.
So I got an extra 40 grand.

1672
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:48,340
That's when I was getting 10 and 10.
That's 60 grand,

1673
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:51,760
10 percent coaches,
10 percent of management pay the irs.

1674
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:55,240
That's not a lot spread over the year
and it's less than a teacher.

1675
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:57,220
So I needed to work,
you know,

1676
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,260
and then that's Kinda how it goes.
If you have you,

1677
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:03,830
if you,
if you get hurt in a fight and you only

1678
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:06,210
fight that once that year,
that could be the,

1679
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:08,180
the difference.
Yeah.

1680
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,940
It's ridiculous.
When you think about how much risk

1681
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:15,310
versus reward there is in the sport of
fighting,

1682
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:18,940
like at the very high levels.
Like when you're conor mcgregor or Ronda

1683
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:19,121
Rousey,
yeah,

1684
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:20,350
you're going to make millions of
dollars.

1685
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,830
But on the way up to that like,
fuck,

1686
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,170
can you break through,
you know,

1687
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:29,140
that's really what it comes down to.
And at the same time I was,

1688
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:31,960
you know,
becoming familiar with Iowasca was

1689
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:36,430
having a ceremonies where a lot of shit
was getting uncovered.

1690
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:37,670
And I don't mean like,
Oh,

1691
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,310
I've worked through all this baggage and
all.

1692
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:40,240
No,
there was,

1693
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,650
there was V,
I had many,

1694
01:15:41,651 --> 01:15:46,480
many great visions and each ceremony has
its own.

1695
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,500
It's its own thing.
It's completely unique from another same

1696
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:53,110
thing with dmt that it's its own fucking
thing.

1697
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:58,500
And it helped me grow as a person.
I can't say which ceremony made me not

1698
01:15:59,891 --> 01:16:03,730
have that spark.
But over time that spark went away.

1699
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:07,840
The spark to want to destroy another
person slowly left me.

1700
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:11,450
And it doesn't matter what a fighter
tells you on a flight because of this,

1701
01:16:11,451 --> 01:16:12,190
a fight,
because of that,

1702
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:15,490
they all inside them want to destroy
another person.

1703
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:18,940
Deep down inside they want to destroy
something.

1704
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:20,170
Well,
that's what victory is.

1705
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:21,610
Yeah,
you have to want to.

1706
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:24,310
That victory is you submit someone or UK
on them.

1707
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,630
I mean that's the ultimate victory.

1708
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:29,770
You stopped them and that's really
difficult to do.

1709
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:32,410
So the,
the challenge is extremely high.

1710
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,510
And then the reward,
the endorphins,

1711
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:36,580
the rush,
the feeling of accomplishment,

1712
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,220
all those things.
But at the end of the day,

1713
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,760
I think probably what Iowasca and what
dmt would show you is that,

1714
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:46,480
uh,
you know,

1715
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:51,480
you're causing damage.
It's just this destructive thing,

1716
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,120
you know,
there's no way around it even if you

1717
01:16:55,121 --> 01:16:58,900
both sign up for it.
And even if the guy talks shit before

1718
01:16:58,901 --> 01:17:00,030
the fight.
Yeah.

1719
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:02,040
It doesn't matter what he does,
it's,

1720
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,160
it's A.
Yeah,

1721
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:06,040
I dunno,
I bet it would be really hard to handle

1722
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:09,250
if it was a mismatch,
like say if a,

1723
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:12,080
if you took Iowasca and you had this
vision and then you were supposed to

1724
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:13,460
fight somebody who,
you know,

1725
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:17,270
like in your heart was really fucked.
Like maybe they had bad stand up or

1726
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:17,930
something like that.

1727
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:19,460
And you knew they weren't gonna be able
to take you down.

1728
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:22,100
Like this guy is going to get lit up.
Like,

1729
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,940
sorry dude,
you're,

1730
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:28,280
you're under a false illusion of your
abilities.

1731
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,620
You know,
that that would make it very difficult.

1732
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,630
I would just,
I would imagine.

1733
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:34,270
Yeah.
Well,

1734
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,770
I mean,
you still see guys know,

1735
01:17:35,771 --> 01:17:39,200
like they kind of snap out of it when
they have the opportunity to crush

1736
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:42,470
someone whose life lists and the
referees still hasn't stopped them and

1737
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:45,140
then they pull back.
So there's moments there and there's

1738
01:17:45,141 --> 01:17:46,880
also moments where you're just,
you know,

1739
01:17:46,881 --> 01:17:50,240
you got the blinders on and it's like
this guy,

1740
01:17:50,241 --> 01:17:51,770
you know,
I don't give a shit when the rep comes

1741
01:17:51,771 --> 01:17:52,650
in.
Yeah.

1742
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:56,390
So it was,
I was asking you think that started you

1743
01:17:56,391 --> 01:17:57,180
off this,
uh,

1744
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,990
on this trip of retiring because how old
are you now?

1745
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:00,830
Thirty three.

1746
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:03,320
Thirty three.
So you're still athletically,

1747
01:18:03,321 --> 01:18:06,800
you're still in your prime.
I feel better than I've ever felt in my

1748
01:18:06,801 --> 01:18:07,790
life.
Physically,

1749
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:08,900
mentally,
emotionally.

1750
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:12,100
Does it ever like fuck with you every
now and then does there,

1751
01:18:12,101 --> 01:18:13,610
is there ever like a little thing and
signing,

1752
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,453
like,
come on guys.

1753
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:17,300
If I watch,
that's why I stopped striking.

1754
01:18:17,301 --> 01:18:19,250
Like you sharpen the blade,
you want to test it,

1755
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,890
you know,
I still do.

1756
01:18:20,910 --> 01:18:24,050
I'll do Jujitsu the rest of my life,
but I can't strike if I strike,

1757
01:18:24,051 --> 01:18:26,400
I know I'll have that itch really.
You know,

1758
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:29,910
I'll have the itch to spar and from
sparring I'll,

1759
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:32,300
you know,
I'll have a couple of good days and your

1760
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:35,180
who,
who am I testing that against world

1761
01:18:35,181 --> 01:18:38,700
champions.
So if I fucking hang right next shortly,

1762
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:42,290
you should be able to apply this to guys
that don't have a belt wrapped around

1763
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:42,650
their waists.

1764
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:44,600
Yeah.
But uh,

1765
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:47,360
you know,
the more I've learned on a living,

1766
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:50,660
listen to like Dr Rhonda,
Patrick and people like that I've had my

1767
01:18:50,661 --> 01:18:55,661
face broken twice to act like that
doesn't have permanent effects.

1768
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,840
I mean,
it's ridiculous to think like,

1769
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:00,411
Oh,
you know,

1770
01:19:00,411 --> 01:19:01,740
it's just an orbital fracture.
No,

1771
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,940
the guy fucking smashed my face.
Like there's for sure longterm damage

1772
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:08,210
there that I'm not.
Maybe not feeling it right now,

1773
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:12,980
but that's an issue I have to address.
And the guys only a couple of years

1774
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,240
older.
I'm 33,

1775
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:17,450
35,
36 and they start to slow down a little

1776
01:19:17,451 --> 01:19:21,440
bit or a.
sorry I was getting audio and just one

1777
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:24,050
of your new.
Did it pop off sometimes I think

1778
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:27,380
disconnects a little bit.
See where the connection is.

1779
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,390
There we go.
Okay.

1780
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,660
Um,
yeah,

1781
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:34,940
you see if I can notice it in other
people who are just a couple of years

1782
01:19:34,941 --> 01:19:38,600
older than I know that's what's going to
happen because it's not.

1783
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:40,220
I mean,
you watch a guy like randy couture fight

1784
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:40,851
and you're like,
oh,

1785
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:43,760
that he's in everyone's face and suck
grinded on dudes.

1786
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:47,450
He even with always been knocked out and
things like that.

1787
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,280
He didn't stand in Bang with a lot of
people.

1788
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,760
Like there's not,
I can't think of many fights.

1789
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:57,680
Even when when bonner crushed me for 15
minutes and laid on me and didn't

1790
01:19:57,681 --> 01:20:00,950
attempt much,
I just took a beating in that fight.

1791
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:01,640
You know,
when I,

1792
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,380
when I fought glover,
I had no broken bones,

1793
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:07,800
but that's the only fight where I was
lost leaving octagon.

1794
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,720
Bob Bob left and I didn't know how to
get back to the locker room and I didn't

1795
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:15,420
want to ask anyone because I didn't want
a longer suspension,

1796
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:20,280
a medical suspension.
I mean he fucking buried two hooks after

1797
01:20:20,281 --> 01:20:23,340
slipping my left right Combo,
one left hook.

1798
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:27,120
Then I throw it again.
He slips berries.

1799
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:30,120
That same exact spot in the temple.
And I mean,

1800
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:33,660
that's the only fight where I literally
did not know where the locker room was

1801
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:36,240
and I was wandering around talking to
people,

1802
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:37,230
making small talk.
Like,

1803
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:37,681
oh,
hey,

1804
01:20:37,681 --> 01:20:38,281
how's it going?
Yeah,

1805
01:20:38,281 --> 01:20:40,290
that was a tough fight.
Oh yeah.

1806
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,720
But I didn't know.
I didn't know where anything was.

1807
01:20:42,721 --> 01:20:43,770
And then I finally made have been.
I was like,

1808
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:45,690
Oh fuck dude,
that's bad.

1809
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:48,540
That's really bad.
So you didn't want to ask anybody

1810
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:51,300
because you didn't want a longer medical
suspension.

1811
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,160
Yeah.
Whoa.

1812
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:56,520
So that I felt the effects there on the
brain.

1813
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:59,460
I didn't feel the effects from the
orbital fractures,

1814
01:20:59,461 --> 01:21:01,290
but I could see the effects.
Right.

1815
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:02,370
And then,
you know,

1816
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:04,650
you see a couple of guys just a couple
of years older,

1817
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:10,220
slowing down a little bit and you learn
about health and being holistic and

1818
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:11,220
nutrition.

1819
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:13,560
And what am I doing for myself to be a
better person?

1820
01:21:13,561 --> 01:21:15,150
How can I live,
get more out of life?

1821
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:16,740
Where's my quality of life?
Right.

1822
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:19,870
Well,
if I'm doing that and then that's where

1823
01:21:19,871 --> 01:21:20,704
I could drink.
And

1824
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,930
if I want to alter my consciousness,
there's a better way to do it than with

1825
01:21:24,931 --> 01:21:26,160
that shit.
Right.

1826
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:30,030
And there shouldn't.
It shouldn't be a double edged sword.

1827
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,870
When did you quit drinking?
A January sixth.

1828
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:36,750
The last time I drank of this year,
last year in Peru.

1829
01:21:36,751 --> 01:21:41,030
Hold last year I was a,
I did a ceremony in Columbia and uh,

1830
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:46,170
the guy was talking about addiction to
things and I never felt addicted at all

1831
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,540
to drinking,
but I definitely drank like an asshole

1832
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,550
for sure many,
many times.

1833
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:52,800
Uh,
you know,

1834
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:56,580
but he,
he had mentioned next time you drink,

1835
01:21:56,581 --> 01:21:59,370
ask what you were feeding.
Everything we put in our body is feeding

1836
01:21:59,371 --> 01:22:00,630
something,
ask what you're feeding.

1837
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:03,510
And it just didn't hit me then,
but later on in the ceremony,

1838
01:22:03,511 --> 01:22:05,370
it really stuck in like I could see all
the,

1839
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:08,400
the destructive behavior of,
Oh yeah,

1840
01:22:08,401 --> 01:22:09,660
let's party.
Let's go balls to the wall.

1841
01:22:09,661 --> 01:22:10,300
And you're like,
hey,

1842
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,520
yeah,
slapping five and just,

1843
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:12,720
you know,
college,

1844
01:22:12,721 --> 01:22:15,240
Spring Breaker,
Asu type Jock,

1845
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:16,141
meathead,
you know,

1846
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:17,250
more and more and more and more,
more.

1847
01:22:17,251 --> 01:22:19,740
And then just the destruction,
the toll it was taking on me,

1848
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,450
you know,
especially as you get older,

1849
01:22:21,451 --> 01:22:23,190
like you can drink like that when you're
young,

1850
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,640
but you get to 30 something stops
working,

1851
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:28,980
you're hangovers last a little longer,
you know,

1852
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:30,800
everything.
It's harder to keep up with,

1853
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,460
you think it's also,
you're aware,

1854
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:35,880
I think when you're young,
like I remember being hung over when I

1855
01:22:35,881 --> 01:22:39,900
was young,
but I was so unaware of how that,

1856
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:44,220
like what I put in,
how it affected my body.

1857
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:47,760
Um,
I just thought of myself as I was in

1858
01:22:47,761 --> 01:22:50,250
such a fog of confusion when I was
young.

1859
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:53,910
Just trying to get through life that I
don't think I was aware of my body.

1860
01:22:53,911 --> 01:22:56,720
Like I am aware of now.
Like now if I do things like just

1861
01:22:56,730 --> 01:23:00,780
changing my diet,
I'm like really tuned into what kind of

1862
01:23:00,781 --> 01:23:02,130
effect it's happening,
if any.

1863
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,800
I'm trying to figure it out.
I'm much more aware.

1864
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:09,580
When I was in my twenties,
I don't know if I necessarily recovered

1865
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:13,690
from hangovers better,
but I didn't notice it as much because I

1866
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:15,340
was just dumb.
Yeah.

1867
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:16,180
Well yeah,
there's a,

1868
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:18,460
what are we doing now?
Let's get pizza,

1869
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:19,610
you know,
cracked another beer.

1870
01:23:19,611 --> 01:23:20,330
It,
get rid of that,

1871
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:21,490
whatever that.
Yeah,

1872
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,980
I'm with you on that.
I do feel like there are,

1873
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:26,890
as you age,
your organs just don't keep up the same,

1874
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:29,880
you know,
and I feel like that was a big can,

1875
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:32,860
but really just the,
the reflection for me of seeing how I

1876
01:23:32,861 --> 01:23:37,630
behaved with that versus like if I wanna
if I want to feel different,

1877
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:41,980
thanks to the wonderful people in
California that allow medical cannabis,

1878
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:43,430
I can feel different,
right?

1879
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,630
I could sleep like a baby and I can wake
up with zero hangover.

1880
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,610
Yeah.
And I'm not going to get fat from it.

1881
01:23:48,611 --> 01:23:51,370
I'm not going to feel like shit.
I'm not going to underperform the next

1882
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:52,870
day.
Mentally or physically.

1883
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,770
You also get benefits from it.
Like many bins.

1884
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:59,560
The antiinflammatory benefits,
the mental benefits of it,

1885
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:03,640
the sensitivity benefits,
the comradery that it sort of

1886
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:07,060
stimulates.
There's a lot of sense of community that

1887
01:24:07,061 --> 01:24:10,750
comes with smoking cannabis.
It makes you like a more generous and

1888
01:24:10,751 --> 01:24:14,380
nice person and a lot of ways.
But alcohol

1889
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,340
man,
it has its place.

1890
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:20,560
I mean I think it's fun in a lot of
ways,

1891
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:23,620
but boy,
it's so abused,

1892
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:25,750
but in,
in this culture and our culture,

1893
01:24:25,751 --> 01:24:28,180
it's so.
It's so commonly abused by so many

1894
01:24:28,181 --> 01:24:33,181
people and they don't even consider it.
They just pound them just fucking abuse

1895
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:36,100
pot too.

1896
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,050
There's no doubt about that.
When I was in college,

1897
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:40,780
I abused pot actually here in Graham
Hancock.

1898
01:24:40,781 --> 01:24:44,350
Talk about his relationship under
podcast with cannabis and how Iowasca

1899
01:24:44,351 --> 01:24:47,770
showed him that and he quit for awhile
until coming back on the podcast and

1900
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:48,830
spoken with you.
But yeah,

1901
01:24:48,831 --> 01:24:52,340
that was great because evil kind kinda
do the same thing for me.

1902
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:56,890
It didn't show me my relationship with
weed that way.

1903
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,470
It actually reversed it,
but it showed me that my relationship

1904
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:01,630
with alcohol that way and I don't need
it,

1905
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,120
but it also showed me like,
hey,

1906
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:08,950
cannabis is a plant cannabis.
A Dan Hardee said in one of his visions

1907
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,420
when he asked,
I have asked about cannabis.

1908
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:14,890
Cannabis is my sister was the answer.
Like this is another one of these is

1909
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:16,210
another teacher.
This is another tool.

1910
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:17,380
This is here for you,
use it,

1911
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:21,190
right,
and I think that if you treat it with

1912
01:25:21,191 --> 01:25:24,790
respect and you have an intention and a
reason why you're doing it and it's not,

1913
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:26,540
there's a time and a place for a man.

1914
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:30,040
I just want to get bombed and feel out
of this world or I'm going to push the

1915
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,770
envelope and maybe do a mega dose and
jump into a float tank,

1916
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,140
which I still need to try.
But uh,

1917
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:38,290
you know,
for the most part you can have

1918
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:41,710
relatively small amounts of things like
that and completely improve your quality

1919
01:25:41,711 --> 01:25:44,130
of life with zero repercussion.
Yeah,

1920
01:25:44,230 --> 01:25:47,350
because you put in the time and you have
the right intention of this is what I

1921
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:48,350
want to use it for.
Right?

1922
01:25:49,230 --> 01:25:51,190
Yeah.
Repercussions that it is something you

1923
01:25:51,191 --> 01:25:53,920
have to weigh action versus
repercussion.

1924
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:56,200
And with alcohol,
the repercussions are just fucking

1925
01:25:56,201 --> 01:26:00,760
devastating over time.
It's just such a fucking unfortunate

1926
01:26:00,761 --> 01:26:02,320
one.
They think they've figured out a way to

1927
01:26:02,321 --> 01:26:04,060
create alcohol without any

1928
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,220
hangover.
There's been some new research on

1929
01:26:07,221 --> 01:26:09,640
something that gives you like an
alcoholic effect,

1930
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:14,090
but it doesn't give you a hangover.
I hope it's not like synthetic weed or

1931
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:16,700
something isn't right.
That weirdo knockout shit.

1932
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:21,760
I always wonder what effects on internal
organs fighting has not just done the

1933
01:26:22,401 --> 01:26:24,740
kidneys,
which we know get really fucked up.

1934
01:26:24,741 --> 01:26:25,610
Overweight,
cutting.

1935
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:29,960
It's really bad for you.
A kidney stones are one side effect that

1936
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:32,570
some people seem to suffer from
dehydration,

1937
01:26:32,571 --> 01:26:35,720
from weight cutting.
I know all those had some kidney stones.

1938
01:26:35,721 --> 01:26:37,350
A lot of fighters have had kidney stones
there.

1939
01:26:37,351 --> 01:26:39,140
They're really common for guys who cut a
lot of weight,

1940
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:43,850
but also I would just wonder just body
kicks and knees the body and punches.

1941
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:49,040
I mean how many times he get kicked in
the liver before it does damage to your

1942
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:51,710
liver.
I mean if alcohol is bad for your liver,

1943
01:26:51,711 --> 01:26:53,360
what does a Shin do to it?

1944
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:55,970
You know,
what is what is a fucking vicious left

1945
01:26:55,971 --> 01:26:58,190
hook to the liver?
Just getting by lasted.

1946
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:00,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

1947
01:27:00,201 --> 01:27:02,410
I wonder,
I don't know if there's any mean.

1948
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:07,370
We constantly consider the stress on the
brain and the damage to the brain from

1949
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:10,970
head impacts and brain trauma,
but what about body trauma?

1950
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:16,080
I always wonder about that because I've
seen guys get fucking blast today.

1951
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:17,510
Good.
We know that.

1952
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:21,830
It's like you watch a guy eat a liver
shot and the fights over from a body

1953
01:27:21,831 --> 01:27:23,530
kick it.
Oh,

1954
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:24,373
he's,
yeah.

1955
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,720
Rub some dirt on it and he's fine.
No,

1956
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,890
just ended the fight.
No.

1957
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:35,590
So when you look back at your career and
you look back at all these wars and all

1958
01:27:35,691 --> 01:27:38,120
these crazy fights that you got in,
do you,

1959
01:27:38,121 --> 01:27:40,730
um,
do you think about the damage?

1960
01:27:40,731 --> 01:27:43,220
Do you,
is it something you just like put aside

1961
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:47,420
and you know,
that there probably was some done and

1962
01:27:47,421 --> 01:27:52,310
just just move forward and stay positive
and be healthy from here on out and I

1963
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:54,830
don't.
Here's one thing that I disagree with

1964
01:27:54,831 --> 01:27:55,800
people when they say,
like,

1965
01:27:55,801 --> 01:27:58,070
you know,
when we grew up they said,

1966
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:01,550
oh hey,
you have a set number of brain cells and

1967
01:28:01,551 --> 01:28:03,410
whatever you lose,
you're not going to get back.

1968
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:06,050
And so,
so we now know that's bullshit.

1969
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:10,490
Like our brain can create new cells.
Neurogenesis happens and the more you

1970
01:28:10,491 --> 01:28:11,900
do,
the more new stuff you do,

1971
01:28:11,901 --> 01:28:15,620
whether it's learning an instrument or a
new language or taking a different trail

1972
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:16,760
to hike,
whatever,

1973
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,070
that helps strengthen these new
pathways.

1974
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:20,810
Right,
and make you smarter and just keep your

1975
01:28:20,811 --> 01:28:22,060
brain young.
Yeah.

1976
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:25,730
I don't think for one second that
anything that I'd done in my career

1977
01:28:25,731 --> 01:28:30,731
can't be overcome or that I can't really
feel like from diets like this and

1978
01:28:30,741 --> 01:28:32,720
supplementing with mcts and different
things like that.

1979
01:28:32,721 --> 01:28:37,721
I feel quicker now in sharper now than I
ever have in my life mentally so that

1980
01:28:38,031 --> 01:28:39,290
that's good,
but that said,

1981
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:41,000
I don't.
I don't look back and say,

1982
01:28:41,001 --> 01:28:41,900
oh,
this did this to me.

1983
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:43,970
I look back and say,
I don't want to do more of that.

1984
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:45,230
Right.
Yeah.

1985
01:28:45,231 --> 01:28:48,150
That's a good way of looking at it.
I'm A.

1986
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:50,840
I've talked about this in the podcast
when you heard about Bill Roman Polanski

1987
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,740
created that neuro one supplement
specifically because of his football

1988
01:28:54,741 --> 01:28:56,600
career,
because all the head impacts that he had

1989
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:59,810
seven memory issues,
a bunch of issues with his brain.

1990
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,740
I wonder what's in it.
You know what the product is,

1991
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,120
I don't have it here,
but uh,

1992
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:05,940
the uh,
sent me a couple of tubs of it because I

1993
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:09,750
talked about it a bunch of times and um,
it's not something that we sell at on

1994
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:10,950
it.
It's just something I love.

1995
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,810
It's just good.
Uh,

1996
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,480
and uh,
it's the first neutral pick ever tried

1997
01:29:15,481 --> 01:29:18,030
before we created Alpha brain.
And um,

1998
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:19,730
do you stack them now?
No,

1999
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:22,560
I just,
I rarely try neuro one,

2000
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:24,510
but I liked to do different things.
I like to do.

2001
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:29,870
I like to occasionally try Prasad,
I'm way into nootropics.

2002
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:32,530
Yeah.
You tried to interest the Tamar Roxy

2003
01:29:32,531 --> 01:29:33,361
arrested him?
Yes,

2004
01:29:33,361 --> 01:29:34,800
I have.
How do you like the difference?

2005
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,780
Um,
it's hard to tell,

2006
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,580
you know,
that's one of the things about like I

2007
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:40,710
had a conversation with a dude last
night at the comedy store.

2008
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,270
It was really funny because it was
hilarious because the dude was hammered,

2009
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,261
right?
He's like,

2010
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:49,010
man,
I fucking tried off a brain,

2011
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:50,700
but uh,
shit,

2012
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:51,990
I don't know if it worked,
like,

2013
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:55,140
okay,
define worked.

2014
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:59,020
Like what are you doing?
It's just fucking hanging,

2015
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,080
hanging out man.
But I don't if it didn't feel any

2016
01:30:01,081 --> 01:30:01,621
difference,
I go,

2017
01:30:01,621 --> 01:30:03,330
okay,
it's not,

2018
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,890
it's not like going to make you smarter
with the idea behind it is if you're,

2019
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:11,250
if you're involved in a task.
Like for me,

2020
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:15,900
here's Alpha brain in nootropics are
really critical for me because I rely on

2021
01:30:15,901 --> 01:30:18,540
my memory a lot.
Like when I'm doing the UFC it's a big

2022
01:30:18,541 --> 01:30:21,330
factor.
I'm constantly bringing up past fights

2023
01:30:21,331 --> 01:30:25,800
and I'm constantly talking about
different situations and transitions and

2024
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,560
you know,
this happens when you do that and it,

2025
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,360
all these connections that I have to
make my brain.

2026
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,670
So verbal memory,
recalling fights,

2027
01:30:32,671 --> 01:30:35,340
things like that.
New nootropics are critical for that

2028
01:30:35,341 --> 01:30:37,740
kind of thing.
But if you don't have anything that

2029
01:30:37,741 --> 01:30:40,740
requires your memory,
how do you know if it's working?

2030
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:44,460
If you don't have anything that requires
you to form sentences on the fly,

2031
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:46,440
how do you know if it's working?
Like so?

2032
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:50,220
I think he just had a silly idea.
I think he thought that he was going to

2033
01:30:50,221 --> 01:30:51,570
take this stuff and all of a sudden he's
like,

2034
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:53,730
man,
I know what I'm doing with my life.

2035
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:58,370
Like the fucking light bulb goes,
got uploaded from the matrix with some.

2036
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,600
I get it.
I get it all,

2037
01:31:00,601 --> 01:31:01,570
man.
I didn't feel it,

2038
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:04,050
but it was hilarious because he was
fucking hammered.

2039
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:05,370
Dude was hammered.
He's like,

2040
01:31:05,371 --> 01:31:06,840
I don't know if I felt it.
I'm like,

2041
01:31:06,841 --> 01:31:08,940
okay dude.
First of all,

2042
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,710
how?
How Shit faced?

2043
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:11,550
Are you right now?
He's like,

2044
01:31:11,551 --> 01:31:12,400
I'm poor.
Junk.

2045
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:14,791
Like,
well,

2046
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:16,740
this conversation is going to be weird
anyway.

2047
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:18,240
You know,
you're probably not going to remember

2048
01:31:18,241 --> 01:31:20,610
what I'm saying,
but if you had to do something,

2049
01:31:20,611 --> 01:31:25,020
it was important and I explained all the
different things that has been shown

2050
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:29,460
clinically in double blind placebo
controlled studies to improve on like

2051
01:31:29,461 --> 01:31:32,970
these statistics like you can.
You can show it when you can show with

2052
01:31:32,971 --> 01:31:36,420
60 people and you could show that the
people that take it have these effects

2053
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:38,960
versus the people that don't take it
like this is.

2054
01:31:38,961 --> 01:31:40,650
This is where it will help you,
but it's not.

2055
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:44,400
It's not going to just make you smarter.
But for someone who relies on their mind

2056
01:31:44,401 --> 01:31:47,640
a lot,
whether it's for creativity or for me,

2057
01:31:47,641 --> 01:31:49,760
I like to take it now even before I work
out.

2058
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:53,400
I started doing it before a workout now
and I'm noticing less fatigue.

2059
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:57,660
My mind stays fresh longer,
like in grueling longterm workouts,

2060
01:31:57,661 --> 01:32:00,460
like,
like a long series of pad workouts.

2061
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:03,220
I can,
I can maintain my concentration like

2062
01:32:03,221 --> 01:32:06,790
deep into the seven,
eighth and ninth round of hitting pads.

2063
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:09,670
I don't fade off as much.
Like where I can't remember the

2064
01:32:09,671 --> 01:32:10,810
combinations,
you know,

2065
01:32:10,811 --> 01:32:12,220
you get so tired,
you're like okay,

2066
01:32:12,221 --> 01:32:14,140
what is it again?
Double Jab,

2067
01:32:14,141 --> 01:32:15,310
right hand,
left hook,

2068
01:32:15,311 --> 01:32:16,600
right kick step,
knee.

2069
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:18,010
Got It.
And then you know,

2070
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,450
you're into the left hook and you're
like,

2071
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,970
what the fuck is next?
Because you're so tired,

2072
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:26,860
your brain doesn't work that good.
So I think mental fatigue can contribute

2073
01:32:26,861 --> 01:32:31,450
to physical fatigue or 100 percent
that's in the his book also talk about

2074
01:32:31,451 --> 01:32:33,970
how ketones are,
are pretty much the steady fuel.

2075
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:37,330
So your brain doesn't bonk because
there's an unlimited stream of energy

2076
01:32:37,331 --> 01:32:40,450
coming in at all times.
You don't hit the window where you run

2077
01:32:40,451 --> 01:32:44,500
out of glycogen in your brain as the
master regulator says,

2078
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:45,180
wait a minute.

2079
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:45,431
No,
no,

2080
01:32:45,431 --> 01:32:45,570
no,
no,

2081
01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:45,820
no,
no.

2082
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:47,650
We,
we have a very low supply here.

2083
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:49,930
It's finite.
Nothing else is coming in.

2084
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:54,280
So we're going to downregulate
everything and make you perform like

2085
01:32:54,281 --> 01:32:56,830
shit right now in an effort to hold onto
what we have.

2086
01:32:57,490 --> 01:33:00,010
You know,
you don't ever hit that wall with the

2087
01:33:00,011 --> 01:33:01,390
ketones present in the blood.
Well,

2088
01:33:01,391 --> 01:33:03,280
I've never been in the key to genic
state.

2089
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:07,630
I don't think I've don't.
Do you ever fasted for anything?

2090
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:09,880
Yeah,
maybe.

2091
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:13,390
Maybe like 12 hours.
I've never done that leg work several

2092
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:14,223
days.
No.

2093
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,300
I mean even like fasting is just
deciding.

2094
01:33:16,301 --> 01:33:17,780
I don't feel like eating right now,
you know,

2095
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:21,460
I've never consciously decided to fast.
It's just pretty cool.

2096
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,260
Yeah.
This is an interesting experiment

2097
01:33:23,261 --> 01:33:24,094
because,
um,

2098
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:25,510
I just said,
well,

2099
01:33:25,511 --> 01:33:26,650
you know,
there's nothing to lose.

2100
01:33:26,651 --> 01:33:29,830
Here is nothing is going to fuck me up.
I'm just going to give this a shot and

2101
01:33:29,831 --> 01:33:30,664
see what happens.

2102
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:33,760
I was a little flat yesterday,
like trying to push through.

2103
01:33:33,761 --> 01:33:36,190
I'm a elliptical workout was a little
flat,

2104
01:33:36,490 --> 01:33:41,490
but nothing huge.
Just a required a little more grit,

2105
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:44,420
you know,
just required me to dig down what I

2106
01:33:44,421 --> 01:33:46,450
would rather just get off that fucking
thing.

2107
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:49,960
And around the 35 minute mark,
like the last 10 minutes were pretty

2108
01:33:49,961 --> 01:33:52,270
rough,
but other than that,

2109
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,760
my brain doesn't seem too foggy.
That was one of the things I was

2110
01:33:54,761 --> 01:33:57,490
concerned with that I go on stage and
I'd just be stupid.

2111
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:00,280
Like my brain doesn't work that good.
I'd forget what I was talking about,

2112
01:34:00,281 --> 01:34:01,720
but what do you do you blend.
I mean,

2113
01:34:01,721 --> 01:34:06,280
do you do bulletproof style where you
blend butter and it just says,

2114
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:07,173
okay.
Yeah,

2115
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:10,960
this is at least some help.
I want to check you out.

2116
01:34:10,961 --> 01:34:13,660
Actually I brought in what's check you
out,

2117
01:34:13,661 --> 01:34:15,910
bro Bro.
I know I've told you about this briefly

2118
01:34:15,911 --> 01:34:16,271
here.
Yes,

2119
01:34:16,271 --> 01:34:16,851
you did.
What is,

2120
01:34:16,851 --> 01:34:19,840
if you're not,
if you're not checking your guessing.

2121
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:23,080
So one of the things about these
ketogenic diets is you gotTa,

2122
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:26,470
you gotta act like you're diabetic,
you get a blood ketone monitor

2123
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:31,040
these strips her finger or something.
Yeah,

2124
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:32,680
I'm going to.
I'll give you a fresh one here so you

2125
01:34:32,681 --> 01:34:34,770
don't need my Yo.
Could I get aids from you?

2126
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:37,810
Maybe from Jenny trip.
Jenny high five.

2127
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:45,550
All right.
So what he's got here is some little

2128
01:34:45,610 --> 01:34:47,770
thing that you.
Little pricker.

2129
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:50,730
So what is it like a needle or something
joe?

2130
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:52,560
My little prick.
It's A.

2131
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:54,110
Does it matter lance?
It,

2132
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:55,900
I think is what they call it doesn't
matter.

2133
01:34:55,901 --> 01:34:58,280
No.
So what we have here is a blood ketone

2134
01:34:58,281 --> 01:34:59,114
strip.

2135
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:05,740
Oh yeah.
You're nice and hot.

2136
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:10,920
Well,
what you want there to be warmth in your

2137
01:35:10,921 --> 01:35:13,530
hands or otherwise it's a motherfucker.
Did that make blood?

2138
01:35:13,531 --> 01:35:14,880
I didn't even feel that.
That's so weird.

2139
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,690
I didn't feel bro.
So tough.

2140
01:35:18,691 --> 01:35:20,590
I am Bro.
Little blood on it up.

2141
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:22,350
Well you're going to have to feel
another one here.

2142
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:24,420
God dammit.
I'm going to feel this one now.

2143
01:35:24,421 --> 01:35:27,870
I was talking shit.
So what he's got is this little punch

2144
01:35:27,871 --> 01:35:29,490
thing.
Almost like little state board move.

2145
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:35,230
Not One.
I didn't feel at all like the other one.

2146
01:35:35,231 --> 01:35:37,750
I felt it touched my finger.
That one didn't work.

2147
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:39,700
That's why.
Let me give you a brand new one here.

2148
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:43,120
What's my skins to dick,
bro?

2149
01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:45,940
I got double skin thick.
It's not,

2150
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:48,950
you know,
all those years of training and the Maki

2151
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:51,040
Warrah board.
I do a lot of,

2152
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:54,520
a lot of work.
You know what Mackey Juarez folks,

2153
01:35:54,521 --> 01:35:59,470
if you don't know karate guys,
they take up a board and it's like sort

2154
01:35:59,471 --> 01:36:04,471
of a nailed to the ground or dug into
the ground and sort of locked in place

2155
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:09,340
and the board will give a little bit and
they wrapped the board up with a rope so

2156
01:36:09,341 --> 01:36:13,390
it's really hard.
And then he punch it and develop these

2157
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:16,030
callous,
these thick calluses on their knuckles

2158
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:19,230
and then they would go from that to
brick work.

2159
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:23,610
My friend John Lee back in Boston,
he used to have his,

2160
01:36:24,030 --> 01:36:27,310
his right,
his index finger and his fuck you finger

2161
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,220
than knuckles to those fingers were
fused.

2162
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:33,400
It would be.
It was one big fat rhino.

2163
01:36:33,401 --> 01:36:36,820
Not Goal and it was all just from one
big knuckle.

2164
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:39,160
Yeah,
it was all from him punching shit.

2165
01:36:39,230 --> 01:36:41,590
That is the last guy you wanted punching
you.

2166
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:44,720
He's punching through bricks and shit.
You know,

2167
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:48,580
your pussy little needle things are not
working on my fucking savage skin.

2168
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:52,540
Is it working this time?
God debit.

2169
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:56,430
Well you got some bitch ass needles you
need to get here.

2170
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:59,440
So basically bro,
I have to figure this out.

2171
01:36:59,441 --> 01:37:02,470
Sorry.
So does it work different on different

2172
01:37:02,471 --> 01:37:04,780
people's that what's going on for real,
like no bullshit.

2173
01:37:04,781 --> 01:37:08,630
Just do people have thicker skin wise
here we can go deeper but I'm,

2174
01:37:08,631 --> 01:37:11,710
I'm trying not to be a Dick and put it
on the highest setting and punches into

2175
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:15,490
your setting.
I'm going to flex while you do it.

2176
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:22,200
It's actually the stress of you.
Um,

2177
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:25,690
there's hold on to my hand and shoving
that thing over and over again with no

2178
01:37:25,691 --> 01:37:27,880
pain.
I'm like eventually I'm going to feel

2179
01:37:27,881 --> 01:37:30,190
pain.
So it's like if I just felt pain the

2180
01:37:30,191 --> 01:37:35,080
first time but it'd be very minimal.
We've got now you got a razor blade in

2181
01:37:35,081 --> 01:37:36,790
there.
I'm putting it in a new test strip.

2182
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:41,800
Just to double check here and explain to
me what this thing is testing for.

2183
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,330
There's a little blood on my fingers.

2184
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:45,270
Yeah,
we want more.

2185
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,840
Did he feel that?
Barely.

2186
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:50,213
Damn.

2187
01:37:51,190 --> 01:37:53,140
Go deep son.
Don't be scared.

2188
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,620
I do.
Double check.

2189
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:55,530
Ryan.
I'll Jamie,

2190
01:37:55,531 --> 01:37:56,070
she added in

2191
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:56,903
there.
Hey,

2192
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:03,440
I don't like that phrasing
is not working.

2193
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:05,630
Huh?
A goddamn.

2194
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:08,810
It'll allow you to just fucking tapped
this thing.

2195
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:10,760
Okay.
What do you do?

2196
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:12,530
We don't want you to just tap it.
Well,

2197
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:14,480
what is it?
It's a fucking little needle.

2198
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:15,860
Alright,
I'm just shove it in there.

2199
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,690
There you go.
Shove it in there.

2200
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:18,411
Pull it out.
Now.

2201
01:38:18,411 --> 01:38:21,410
Make yourself bleed a bit.
Give me a drop.

2202
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:23,860
Put her on this bad boy.
So good.

2203
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:29,860
Could be
man.

2204
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:34,190
I shoved that all the way in.
Yeah.

2205
01:38:34,191 --> 01:38:35,690
I want you to.
You did.

2206
01:38:35,930 --> 01:38:36,763
Oh,
there we go.

2207
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:39,890
That's okay.
Don't worry folks.

2208
01:38:39,891 --> 01:38:40,724
Okay,
now we got it.

2209
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,310
We got some sweet blood.
Now we've got a countdown here.

2210
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:46,190
Ten seconds.
It's going to tell us your blood

2211
01:38:46,191 --> 01:38:48,770
ketones.
So basically you want to be between zero

2212
01:38:48,771 --> 01:38:49,604
point five.

2213
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:51,990
Oh,

2214
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:53,450
what does it say?
Low.

2215
01:38:53,930 --> 01:38:54,763
Low.
What does that mean?

2216
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:58,940
Low battery.
Low battery or low key ketones.

2217
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:00,110
Me?
Yeah.

2218
01:39:00,410 --> 01:39:02,180
Really?
It doesn't make sense.

2219
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:04,190
Let's do another show.
I'm bleeding.

2220
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,170
I know we got you.
I got some good blood here,

2221
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,190
another strip.
Keep it up.

2222
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,640
Keep the bloodline open.
Squeezes bitch.

2223
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:14,620
Fucking junk science or go.
Is this bro?

2224
01:39:14,630 --> 01:39:15,860
Science Bro.
Bro.

2225
01:39:15,861 --> 01:39:18,070
Science bro,
bro Bro.

2226
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:20,690
Alright,
one more test here.

2227
01:39:20,691 --> 01:39:21,524
Okay.

2228
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:26,800
Three,
two,

2229
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:31,240
one.
Zero point one.

2230
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:33,550
What does that pathetic.
That's terrible.

2231
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:37,990
You want to be between zero point five.
About three point.

2232
01:39:37,991 --> 01:39:39,460
Oh,
and you can go higher than that if

2233
01:39:39,461 --> 01:39:44,140
you're like in a really extended fast or
if you take exogenous ketones.

2234
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:45,970
Right?
And then you go above three point.

2235
01:39:45,971 --> 01:39:48,070
Oh,
but basically zero point five,

2236
01:39:48,071 --> 01:39:50,410
you're in nutritional ketosis given one
more test.

2237
01:39:50,411 --> 01:39:52,930
Just to be sure that this isn't bullshit
because I'm not certain.

2238
01:39:52,931 --> 01:39:57,931
I believe you're fucking stupid machine.
If it varies,

2239
01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:00,670
that's a problem,
right?

2240
01:40:00,671 --> 01:40:03,430
If you do it again and you get a
devastating yeah,

2241
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:08,490
that would be a problem.
I don't know that I'm going to get it.

2242
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:13,130
Why is that was about all that blood to
step well,

2243
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:18,180
because it's got to come in a little dry
just to have it again.

2244
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:32,120
What's the negative of being where he's
at at point one?

2245
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,650
I'm going to stab it again.
Well,

2246
01:40:33,651 --> 01:40:36,470
he's in no man's land,
so he doesn't have carbohydrates coming

2247
01:40:36,471 --> 01:40:39,680
in right to fuel his body and he's not
producing ketones.

2248
01:40:39,681 --> 01:40:41,900
So did you work out beforehand?
Yeah,

2249
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:44,960
that's why is that just fucking saw.
Should have asked beforehand.

2250
01:40:45,590 --> 01:40:48,860
So whatever ketones you have from the
mcts your body's using.

2251
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:51,260
Oh,
that's why your blood ketones aren't

2252
01:40:51,261 --> 01:40:53,000
high.
I worked out right before I got it.

2253
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:54,190
That's exactly.
Yeah.

2254
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,350
It's going to confirm it here,
but that's exactly why.

2255
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,230
So I've,
I've tested,

2256
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:03,190
I've been in Ketosis for awhile and
tested and seen like zero point three

2257
01:41:03,191 --> 01:41:04,240
and I'm like,
what the fuck?

2258
01:41:04,241 --> 01:41:05,890
And then I listened to dominic
d'agostino.

2259
01:41:05,891 --> 01:41:09,830
Talk about that your body will use with
the ketones out.

2260
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:11,950
That's why you're producing.
It's an energy source.

2261
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:15,070
So you work out.
That's going to go to fill your body the

2262
01:41:15,071 --> 01:41:18,490
way the blood glucose would have prior
to that.

2263
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:21,760
What is [inaudible]?
It means it's cold.

2264
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:24,790
You know what I'm saying?
What does that mean machine?

2265
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:25,653
I don't know.

2266
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:30,970
It's too cold.
I guess it's too cold machine.

2267
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:32,440
The machine.
The machine is cold.

2268
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:35,320
So what do you do?
Do you heat it up?

2269
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:37,780
Put it in the microwave.
I stick it in my armpit when I'm getting

2270
01:41:37,781 --> 01:41:38,860
ready.
The machine?

2271
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:40,103
Yeah,
just right here.

2272
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:41,553
Boom.
Okay.

2273
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:42,510
So warmer,
but it's.

2274
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:45,010
I just prepped myself for nothing that
you did.

2275
01:41:45,011 --> 01:41:47,350
Pick yourself for nothing.
What are all these things that you're

2276
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:48,760
sticking in there?
What are all those things?

2277
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:50,860
But these are all the.
The.

2278
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:53,170
This is your trash actually.
That's your little.

2279
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:54,520
I don't know where you've been.
Basket.

2280
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:56,680
That's a.
What are those things in there?

2281
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:59,800
Those are the bits that poke you and
then the test strips,

2282
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,690
but any ways you would do this at night
before?

2283
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:05,830
Usually before dinner,
if you're going to have the highest

2284
01:42:05,831 --> 01:42:09,190
ketones,
then if you have a night workout then

2285
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,500
have at least a couple of soft right now
so I could see what you get.

2286
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:12,940
I'm out.
You're out.

2287
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:15,040
You put the last one,
the last trip to you.

2288
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:16,200
Oh sorry.
You got the written.

2289
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:17,113
Ah,
it's all good.

2290
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:18,460
I've got more at the house,
but.

2291
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:22,000
So you carry these around.
You just do it once a day or how many

2292
01:42:22,001 --> 01:42:24,100
times do they do?
There are a few bucks a piece,

2293
01:42:24,130 --> 01:42:26,200
so I usually just do them at night.
Um,

2294
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:29,440
when the ketones are highest just to
make sure that I'm nutritionally,

2295
01:42:29,441 --> 01:42:33,790
they're a mct oil.
It's usually worn off by that point,

2296
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:36,550
so I can tell like,
am I producing my own ketones as opposed

2297
01:42:36,551 --> 01:42:38,830
to just getting it artificially raised
from the MCTs.

2298
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:40,120
Oh,
I see.

2299
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:43,720
Okay.
It doesn't need to be three point zero.

2300
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:45,400
If it's zero point five,
I'm good,

2301
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:48,460
but I will feel the difference when I
reached the one point.

2302
01:42:48,461 --> 01:42:49,450
Oh,
between one point.

2303
01:42:49,451 --> 01:42:50,021
Oh,
and two point.

2304
01:42:50,021 --> 01:42:51,160
Oh,
one point.

2305
01:42:51,161 --> 01:42:51,881
Oh,
and two point.

2306
01:42:51,881 --> 01:42:53,560
Oh One,
I zero point one.

2307
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:54,550
Zero point one.
Yeah,

2308
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,680
that's dog shit.
But it doesn't mean anything because you

2309
01:42:56,681 --> 01:42:58,120
just worked out.
I'm depressed.

2310
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:04,990
Okay.
So what I'm shooting for though is a

2311
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:07,170
zero point five or higher.
Anything above that,

2312
01:43:07,171 --> 01:43:09,190
five or higher.
But you've gotten to one or two.

2313
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:11,140
I've been above three point.
Oh,

2314
01:43:11,141 --> 01:43:16,141
from fasting or from exogenous ketones.
But if I'm on a daily basis between one

2315
01:43:16,841 --> 01:43:17,790
point.
Oh and two point.

2316
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:20,020
Oh,
then I'm doing good and that means the

2317
01:43:20,021 --> 01:43:25,021
foods I'm putting in my body.
I haven't exceeded my protein limits and

2318
01:43:25,181 --> 01:43:27,540
Claus Gluconeogenesis or any of these
things like I'm.

2319
01:43:27,610 --> 01:43:30,640
I've dialed in my nutrition over time
and that's what it is.

2320
01:43:30,641 --> 01:43:31,890
It's just fine tuning.
Right?

2321
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:36,340
Like women can process much more
carbohydrates than weekend on a

2322
01:43:36,341 --> 01:43:37,800
ketogenic diet.
Really more.

2323
01:43:37,830 --> 01:43:38,561
Yeah,
way more.

2324
01:43:38,561 --> 01:43:41,470
I don't know if it's because of the
hormones and the menstrual cycle or

2325
01:43:41,650 --> 01:43:43,150
because they're evil.
I have no idea,

2326
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:45,910
but they can get away with way more.
Could it be evil?

2327
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:47,620
Just some.
Some food.

2328
01:43:48,310 --> 01:43:49,940
That's interesting.
I wonder what that has meant.

2329
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:54,990
Wonder if it's because they have to
maintain a higher body fat to make lacto

2330
01:43:56,030 --> 01:43:59,210
to make milk and to.
It's possible feed the baby and grow.

2331
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:01,010
Titties.
Tossed.

2332
01:44:01,150 --> 01:44:03,170
Yeah.
Tosh was in Ketosis the whole time

2333
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:06,380
during the pregnancy and she still had
plenty of carbohydrates.

2334
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:09,680
That's interesting.
And this was so it was a conscious

2335
01:44:09,681 --> 01:44:12,230
decision to,
to reach that state during the

2336
01:44:12,231 --> 01:44:13,340
pregnancy?
Not at all.

2337
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:13,661
No,
no,

2338
01:44:13,661 --> 01:44:14,181
no.
She was,

2339
01:44:14,181 --> 01:44:15,230
she.
She asked me like,

2340
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:17,000
Oh hey,
he would see where I'm at and I'm like,

2341
01:44:17,001 --> 01:44:21,650
I'm going to waste $3 on you right now.
You're at zero point zero.

2342
01:44:21,651 --> 01:44:22,940
I just told you what you're at.
Right?

2343
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:23,361
It's like,
no,

2344
01:44:23,361 --> 01:44:24,980
seriously.
I want to see like I feel good.

2345
01:44:24,981 --> 01:44:26,100
You know,
it's okay.

2346
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:28,430
So we did it and she was higher than I
was.

2347
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:29,540
Whoa.
I was like,

2348
01:44:29,541 --> 01:44:31,190
what the fuck?
But it makes perfect sense.

2349
01:44:31,191 --> 01:44:34,760
I mean if you're sending resources to
build a human right,

2350
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:37,250
you know,
and you want that steady flow,

2351
01:44:37,251 --> 01:44:39,080
it makes sense.
The body would produce that in a

2352
01:44:39,081 --> 01:44:41,840
situation like that just in case you ran
out of carbohydrates.

2353
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:45,230
It is interesting because women,
oftentimes when they're pregnant,

2354
01:44:45,231 --> 01:44:48,170
they crave a really fatty foods,
like the crave ice cream and things

2355
01:44:48,171 --> 01:44:50,270
along those lines,
but that's not ketogenic,

2356
01:44:50,271 --> 01:44:52,280
right?
Because it has a lot of sugar in it.

2357
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:53,271
Well,
there's sugar in that.

2358
01:44:53,271 --> 01:44:54,410
Yeah.
Your cravings,

2359
01:44:54,411 --> 01:44:56,600
your cravings,
but you want to.

2360
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:59,000
If there's a,
if there's a calling to have more fat,

2361
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:00,990
you want more fat,
that doesn't necessarily mean it's going

2362
01:45:00,991 --> 01:45:04,730
to put you in ketosis right now.
If you say,

2363
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:08,660
if you're in this key to genic state and
you eat some carbohydrates,

2364
01:45:08,661 --> 01:45:12,650
you eat like a big bowl of pasta,
how much does it whack you out of that

2365
01:45:12,651 --> 01:45:14,060
ketogenic state?
Three to four.

2366
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:18,430
Three to four days is typically what it
would take to get back in bed.

2367
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:22,400
Put it this way.
I mean because I've been in and out of

2368
01:45:22,401 --> 01:45:25,310
it for as long as I have and because I
work out the way you work out,

2369
01:45:25,311 --> 01:45:27,200
you know,
high intensity stuff with kettlebells or

2370
01:45:27,201 --> 01:45:29,990
I'll go for a distance from whatever and
then still train on the mat.

2371
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:31,670
That's high intensity when you're
grappling.

2372
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:37,640
I had a Saturday.
We went off the deep end.

2373
01:45:37,641 --> 01:45:41,330
I had to gluten free pizzas with Tosh
and we had a bunch of gluten free

2374
01:45:41,331 --> 01:45:46,331
cookies and the fricking leader of this
awesome grass fed milk loaded with carbs

2375
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,610
and I probably had 500 grams of
carbohydrates.

2376
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:53,240
Grass fed milk is loaded with carbs.
Milk for sure.

2377
01:45:53,241 --> 01:45:55,500
Milk is long period.
Doesn't matter if it's aggressive.

2378
01:45:55,670 --> 01:45:57,380
It matters if it's grass fed or grain
fed,

2379
01:45:57,381 --> 01:46:01,070
but not from a carbohydrate standpoint.
Nobody would think that milk would be a

2380
01:46:01,071 --> 01:46:02,560
source of carbohydrates.
What?

2381
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:05,770
Nine to 12 grams per cup,
so if you have a leader in your,

2382
01:46:05,771 --> 01:46:09,020
you have four cups,
which is easy to do and read and cookies

2383
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,840
that you just had 50 grams of carbs just
from the milk.

2384
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:13,490
Whoa.
How many grams of carbs?

2385
01:46:13,491 --> 01:46:18,440
You're supposed to have a day in a in a
ketogenic diet between 30 and 50 during

2386
01:46:18,441 --> 01:46:21,410
the Keto adaptation phase,
which is six to eight weeks,

2387
01:46:21,411 --> 01:46:24,500
and then after that you can play,
but that's the whole reason you check

2388
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:27,490
because if you're doing 50 grams a day
thinking,

2389
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,270
Hey,
I'm going within my limit and you're

2390
01:46:29,271 --> 01:46:32,390
still at point three,
point four and fuck with somebody else

2391
01:46:32,391 --> 01:46:34,430
tells you that's when it's time to dial
it down a bit.

2392
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:36,050
Or maybe my,
my,

2393
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:38,750
my carbohydrates are fine,
but I'm still not in Ketosis.

2394
01:46:38,751 --> 01:46:41,960
That means you're eating too much
protein or maybe I need to add more fat

2395
01:46:41,961 --> 01:46:44,840
to my meals.
So the ratio is there and they talked

2396
01:46:44,841 --> 01:46:45,830
about it.
John Hopkins,

2397
01:46:45,831 --> 01:46:47,900
they were talking about for the,
for the kids with epilepsy,

2398
01:46:48,210 --> 01:46:52,350
four to one ratio of fat to protein and
carbohydrates combined.

2399
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:55,550
Now that's pretty.
It's pretty hard to do if you think of

2400
01:46:55,551 --> 01:46:58,920
how many you eat a steak,
there's 50 grams of protein and there's

2401
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:00,300
equal amount of fat.
Let's say,

2402
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:04,800
now I have to multiply that by four and
if there's any carbohydrates to add to

2403
01:47:04,801 --> 01:47:07,230
that,
then add that to the total for the four

2404
01:47:07,231 --> 01:47:10,560
to one ratio,
so you're going to have just ridiculous

2405
01:47:10,561 --> 01:47:14,930
amounts of fat to to accomplish that.
What is that device called that you just

2406
01:47:15,230 --> 01:47:17,070
use?
It's a blood ketone meter.

2407
01:47:17,190 --> 01:47:19,470
I use the Nova Max.
One is the cheapest.

2408
01:47:19,471 --> 01:47:22,230
There's a couple other ones that are
five or $6 a strip.

2409
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:27,030
You can get that on Amazon.
The meter itself is only like 20 bucks

2410
01:47:27,031 --> 01:47:30,330
and then the strips are a little bit
more and so the strips,

2411
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:32,820
you have to use blood.
Is there another way to do it?

2412
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:35,850
There is a piss test,
which doesn't work at all.

2413
01:47:35,930 --> 01:47:38,610
Um,
the problem with that is once your body

2414
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:41,790
becomes keto adapted,
it learns how to better use these things

2415
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:45,060
so they're not excreted in the urine.
So when it tests for acetone,

2416
01:47:45,061 --> 01:47:47,880
I think is a cdot Acetate,
something like that,

2417
01:47:47,881 --> 01:47:51,390
it's one of the less prominent ketones
to begin with.

2418
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:55,290
So when we convert fat into Ketones,
we have three major ketone bodies.

2419
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:59,460
Beta hydroxy butyrate is the one that
you test for with the blood strip that's

2420
01:47:59,461 --> 01:48:02,340
the most 80 percent most abundant in the
blood.

2421
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:06,180
If you do the urine strip and your
body's becoming Keto adapted,

2422
01:48:06,210 --> 01:48:07,800
well,
you're not gonna piss anymore out.

2423
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:11,460
So you could be completely in
nutritional ketosis and use a strip and

2424
01:48:11,461 --> 01:48:12,061
be like,
hey man,

2425
01:48:12,061 --> 01:48:13,710
I'm not in Ketosis.
What's going on?

2426
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:16,560
And it's not that at all.
It's just that your body's not wasting

2427
01:48:16,561 --> 01:48:20,940
any out of the urine anymore.
Then they have breast strips or breath.

2428
01:48:20,941 --> 01:48:24,120
The breath meter you can blow into and I
can't stand the thing.

2429
01:48:24,121 --> 01:48:26,280
I used it for awhile.
I tried to get into it because it's

2430
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:30,090
obviously you can reuse it at 100,000
times and it's still going to be the

2431
01:48:30,091 --> 01:48:31,980
same cost,
but uh,

2432
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:35,070
it shows like a,
on a gliding scale,

2433
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:39,660
like an led light.
So green is not in Ketosis,

2434
01:48:39,661 --> 01:48:41,040
red is in Ketosis,
whatever.

2435
01:48:41,041 --> 01:48:44,340
And then in between you have like green,
yellow and yellow,

2436
01:48:44,341 --> 01:48:46,050
orange.
It's all,

2437
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:48,570
it's so fucking hard to read and then
you're trying to figure out,

2438
01:48:48,571 --> 01:48:49,560
well I feel,
you know,

2439
01:48:49,580 --> 01:48:50,520
it's no,
no,

2440
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:51,030
no,
no.

2441
01:48:51,030 --> 01:48:52,410
Just to do the blood,
get,

2442
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,480
get me to the 10th.
Exactly where I'm at.

2443
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:58,590
And then you get to all the guests
workout and what exactly is it

2444
01:48:58,591 --> 01:49:00,670
measuring?
Like when you say blood ketones.

2445
01:49:00,671 --> 01:49:05,671
So what is the number represent?
One millimolar is a measurement of the

2446
01:49:06,811 --> 01:49:10,440
Beta hydroxybutyrate ketone millimolar
millimolar.

2447
01:49:10,870 --> 01:49:12,270
Hm.
Wow.

2448
01:49:12,470 --> 01:49:14,610
So you've been doing this for awhile.
Yeah,

2449
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:16,920
I've read a ton of books on it.
And the thing is,

2450
01:49:17,190 --> 01:49:18,600
you know,
most diets people,

2451
01:49:18,601 --> 01:49:21,890
I've tried a ton of different diets.
This one you feel good.

2452
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:24,360
You can eat as much as you want.
Like when Dave aspery talks about eating

2453
01:49:24,361 --> 01:49:26,910
4,500 calories a day and working out
whatever he said,

2454
01:49:26,911 --> 01:49:29,760
15 minutes of fucking month or whatever.
Some nonsense.

2455
01:49:29,761 --> 01:49:32,010
Yeah,
here you are going to lose weight.

2456
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:35,280
I'm a better example in the four hour
body,

2457
01:49:35,281 --> 01:49:37,560
Tim ferriss talks about the study they
did on calories in,

2458
01:49:37,561 --> 01:49:38,190
calories out.

2459
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:40,140
I love this study.
Three,

2460
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:43,620
three groups of people had 2000 calories
a day.

2461
01:49:44,190 --> 01:49:47,130
One group a 90 percent carbs,
groupie 90 percent,

2462
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:48,940
Group C,
90 percent fat,

2463
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:54,280
not Shaked out.
Carbohydrate group gained one and a half

2464
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:57,460
pounds a day.
Protein group lost a quarter pound a

2465
01:49:57,470 --> 01:49:59,620
day.
Fat Group lost a pound a day,

2466
01:49:59,950 --> 01:50:04,600
90 percent fat in their diet and they
lost a pound a day up on the same 2000

2467
01:50:04,601 --> 01:50:07,420
calories.
Keep an think about that.

2468
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:08,770
2,000 colors,
not a lot.

2469
01:50:08,771 --> 01:50:11,770
So if you had 200 calories of
carbohydrates and you're going to gain

2470
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:14,440
weight from that and you can gain weight
from 2000 calories a day.

2471
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:16,060
Yeah,
that's incredible.

2472
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:18,370
So there's other factors and things like
that,

2473
01:50:18,371 --> 01:50:23,371
but there's that just dispels this
concept of all count count calories.

2474
01:50:23,741 --> 01:50:24,970
They're all the same,
they're not the same,

2475
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:28,630
they're not the same at all.
How they impact hormones is not the same

2476
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:30,070
hormonal function.

2477
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:33,820
Insulin response when our bodies,
what does insulin do?

2478
01:50:33,821 --> 01:50:35,260
Well,
it stores it shuttles things,

2479
01:50:35,261 --> 01:50:38,200
right?
So if we are constantly inundating

2480
01:50:38,201 --> 01:50:41,080
ourselves with carbohydrates and in this
store mode,

2481
01:50:41,081 --> 01:50:43,080
any excess is getting put on,
right?

2482
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:46,060
How do you tell your body to burn fat,
which takes a longer,

2483
01:50:46,061 --> 01:50:49,360
harder process when you have this easy
super rapid thing,

2484
01:50:49,361 --> 01:50:52,870
it can break down and then use collect.
Politically it doesn't make sense,

2485
01:50:52,930 --> 01:50:55,810
but when they talked to the instagram
wizards,

2486
01:50:56,110 --> 01:50:56,800
these,
these,

2487
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,950
these dieticians in training,
they'll tell you,

2488
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:02,290
bro,
you need fucking carbohydrates to

2489
01:51:02,291 --> 01:51:03,640
operate your brain,
bro.

2490
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:04,720
Yeah,
all the science.

2491
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:08,590
I love this too,
and you talk about science and Eddie

2492
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:11,050
Bravo would probably like this to Mr.
conspiracy theory guy.

2493
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:14,800
I love him.
Who pays for that fucking carbohydrate

2494
01:51:14,801 --> 01:51:16,600
research?
Gatorade,

2495
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,250
Gatorade,
Sports Science Institute,

2496
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:22,300
Gatorade Sports Science Institute has
done a majority studies.

2497
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:27,430
Nestle skates,
gatorade is gatorade that's doing a lot

2498
01:51:27,431 --> 01:51:29,290
of the studies on carbohydrate
performance.

2499
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:31,460
They're the guys that also proved,
oh,

2500
01:51:31,470 --> 01:51:35,020
this is the tipping point for fat
oxidation and an hour even though they

2501
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:38,290
use people that have been in Ketosis for
two weeks instead of two years.

2502
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:43,690
So when you talk about guys like Jeff
and Steve Volvo Cuban doing this

2503
01:51:43,691 --> 01:51:47,470
research now since the eighties and
using athletes that have been keto

2504
01:51:47,471 --> 01:51:49,270
adapted for awhile,
that's when you really begin to see

2505
01:51:49,271 --> 01:51:50,104
like,
Oh shit,

2506
01:51:50,530 --> 01:51:51,670
okay,
this can work.

2507
01:51:51,671 --> 01:51:53,620
And not just from a physical standpoint.
Like I said,

2508
01:51:53,621 --> 01:51:56,110
the thing that I get mostly from it is
the mental.

2509
01:51:56,410 --> 01:51:57,760
It's the,
it's the sharpness.

2510
01:51:58,090 --> 01:52:00,310
And uh,
dominic d'agostino was talking about how

2511
01:52:00,311 --> 01:52:04,660
you can go on way less sleep,
but there's some type of thing that

2512
01:52:04,661 --> 01:52:08,140
ketones do with the brain where you
actually are more rested.

2513
01:52:08,410 --> 01:52:10,630
Even if you had,
if you were sleep deprived.

2514
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:12,370
So if you had five or six hours of
sleep,

2515
01:52:12,371 --> 01:52:15,850
you can still wake up feeling refreshed
and have your sharpness in the morning

2516
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:18,810
rather than being on a heavy
carbohydrate intensive diet.

2517
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:22,210
Exactly.
So they're not sure the mechanism for

2518
01:52:22,211 --> 01:52:23,044
that yet.
That's one.

2519
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:25,750
That's why they got these,
these geniuses studying these things,

2520
01:52:25,751 --> 01:52:29,590
but I think that there's nothing more
important than when you try something

2521
01:52:29,591 --> 01:52:32,320
and you actually feel the difference.
And that's not me saying like,

2522
01:52:32,321 --> 01:52:33,154
Oh,
you know,

2523
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:35,350
if you're Vegan,
whatever.

2524
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:38,740
If you're Vegan and you feel awesome,
fucking awesome,

2525
01:52:38,741 --> 01:52:40,450
dude.
I'm not going to tell you to change.

2526
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:41,020
I'm going to say,
well,

2527
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:42,100
you should've had this dude.
No,

2528
01:52:42,101 --> 01:52:42,630
dude,
you've,

2529
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:44,410
you've dialed it in.
Everyone's different,

2530
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,070
but this for me has worked

2531
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,090
wonders.
Well,

2532
01:52:47,091 --> 01:52:49,550
there's also awesome and then there's
better than awesome.

2533
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:50,560
You know,
like some,

2534
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:51,650
some people say like,
Hey,

2535
01:52:51,651 --> 01:52:53,810
I've been on this diet and I feel
fantastic,

2536
01:52:54,050 --> 01:52:55,850
so I'm just going to keep it the way it
is.

2537
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:58,700
But meanwhile,
if you added a certain thing to your

2538
01:52:58,701 --> 01:53:02,030
diet or added a little bit more vitamin
D or adding a little bit more,

2539
01:53:02,090 --> 01:53:03,400
you might feel actually better.
Yeah.

2540
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:07,080
I like your idea of what awesome is.
I think a lot of times it's like if you

2541
01:53:07,081 --> 01:53:09,440
ever have water in your ear and you
think everything's okay,

2542
01:53:09,710 --> 01:53:10,970
like Ah,
this is how I hear,

2543
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:12,440
and then you know,
like pop,

2544
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:13,730
it pops and you go,
oh,

2545
01:53:13,731 --> 01:53:17,070
I could hear like this.
Like you weren't even considering that

2546
01:53:17,071 --> 01:53:18,440
you,
you were hearing like shit.

2547
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:22,630
That's what cracks me up about when
people taught and by no means of my,

2548
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:25,010
some type of psychedelic pusher or
anything like that.

2549
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:26,900
But you know,
when I first did Iowaska I was,

2550
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:30,620
it consumed my mind,
Holy Shit,

2551
01:53:30,621 --> 01:53:32,750
I want to stand on a mountain top and
tell people about this.

2552
01:53:32,751 --> 01:53:34,730
I want every one of my friends to know
about it.

2553
01:53:34,731 --> 01:53:36,050
My family,
I want them to try this.

2554
01:53:36,051 --> 01:53:38,270
I want them to see what I've seen.
Like I don't want them to experience

2555
01:53:38,271 --> 01:53:40,460
this.
And then over time you realize like,

2556
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:43,430
Oh,
you've listened to people tie like,

2557
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:45,470
no,
I really don't want like,

2558
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:48,760
life's just so good right now.
I don't really need to change anything.

2559
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:51,050
Like,
are you a fucking finished product?

2560
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:52,770
You can't improve your life.
You,

2561
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:54,740
Mr. Perfect.
I'm Mr Manhattan.

2562
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:58,400
I'm Dr Manhattan,
like there's no room for getting better.

2563
01:53:58,401 --> 01:54:01,400
There's no room for,
for enjoying life more improving really,

2564
01:54:01,401 --> 01:54:02,061
whatever,
you know.

2565
01:54:02,061 --> 01:54:04,150
And that was just funny to me.
Uh,

2566
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:06,530
that dynamic,
you know,

2567
01:54:06,531 --> 01:54:08,930
there are a lot of people that just say
to themselves like,

2568
01:54:08,931 --> 01:54:11,030
I'm comfortable.
Why Change?

2569
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:15,140
Yeah,
well people don't like feeling like shit

2570
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:18,950
and they don't like feeling like their
houses in disarray.

2571
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:21,200
And so if they get to a state where they
go,

2572
01:54:21,201 --> 01:54:21,690
I,
I'm,

2573
01:54:21,690 --> 01:54:23,450
I'm happy right now.
Everything's good.

2574
01:54:23,451 --> 01:54:24,850
I'm happy right now.
Like,

2575
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:26,360
uh,
I'm happy being chubby.

2576
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:29,210
Like I've heard that before.
There's nothing wrong with being chubby.

2577
01:54:29,211 --> 01:54:31,760
I'm happy.
I'm happy right now with the way I am.

2578
01:54:33,370 --> 01:54:35,410
You know,
some people will convince themselves all

2579
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:37,840
they mean.
I oftentimes read things that people

2580
01:54:37,841 --> 01:54:39,040
write and I go,
God damn it.

2581
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:42,580
I wonder if this person is expressing
themselves honestly or if they're trying

2582
01:54:42,581 --> 01:54:46,000
to get other people to be convinced that
they're okay.

2583
01:54:46,810 --> 01:54:49,240
You know how I would lean towards that.
Yeah.

2584
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:52,630
How happy I brought this article up more
than once,

2585
01:54:52,631 --> 01:54:56,030
but I read this article written by this
woman who's 70 years old,

2586
01:54:56,070 --> 01:55:01,070
struggled with weight her whole life and
she was promoting fat acceptance and

2587
01:55:01,631 --> 01:55:05,230
that people are prejudice towards people
that are overweight,

2588
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:09,190
but in fact she's incredibly healthy and
she's so active and she does all these

2589
01:55:09,191 --> 01:55:10,210
things.
She's just always,

2590
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:12,100
always been heavy and I'm like,
hmm,

2591
01:55:12,670 --> 01:55:14,860
see scientifically that doesn't make any
sense.

2592
01:55:15,070 --> 01:55:18,100
It just doesn't like if you're.
If you're eating healthy foods and your

2593
01:55:18,101 --> 01:55:20,860
body's healthy,
you shouldn't be storing that much extra

2594
01:55:20,861 --> 01:55:22,150
fat.
Just doesn't make any sense.

2595
01:55:22,450 --> 01:55:25,290
But she's promoting it in this article,
like if you didn't know any better and

2596
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:27,220
just took this article is like,
well,

2597
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:29,680
this is this one woman's account of her
life.

2598
01:55:29,681 --> 01:55:32,980
And by her accounts she's incredibly
healthy.

2599
01:55:33,250 --> 01:55:36,730
She's hiking and she's so active and
she's eating healthy,

2600
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:37,840
but she's just fat.

2601
01:55:39,570 --> 01:55:41,340
Not,
not really make sense?

2602
01:55:41,370 --> 01:55:43,030
It doesn't know something's missing
there.

2603
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:44,100
What

2604
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,230
is it?
Well,

2605
01:55:46,290 --> 01:55:50,640
I mean,
I actually had this as one of my first

2606
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:54,480
first breakthroughs and my very first
ceremony I was uh,

2607
01:55:55,980 --> 01:56:00,980
I was hearing people violently puke
around me and I thought I was like in a

2608
01:56:01,111 --> 01:56:03,990
war zone and this is just starting to
kick in and see me.

2609
01:56:03,991 --> 01:56:07,650
I've taken the Second Cup Iowasca and it
sounds like people are dying.

2610
01:56:08,370 --> 01:56:09,600
And I realized,
oh,

2611
01:56:09,601 --> 01:56:11,610
they're puking.
And then I thought,

2612
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:14,670
oh,
that's because these fuckers didn't do

2613
01:56:14,671 --> 01:56:16,470
the data.
They didn't eat clean.

2614
01:56:16,471 --> 01:56:18,450
Like you have to eat a certain way prior
to it not,

2615
01:56:18,750 --> 01:56:19,830
oh,
I eat clean,

2616
01:56:19,831 --> 01:56:22,590
I take care of myself.
These people don't take care of

2617
01:56:22,591 --> 01:56:25,020
themselves.
And like all that kind of snowballed

2618
01:56:25,021 --> 01:56:29,010
into this feeling that I had about fat
people in general.

2619
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,810
Like they didn't.
You're not taking care of yourself.

2620
01:56:30,811 --> 01:56:32,280
What are you doing?
Why would you do that to yourself?

2621
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:33,730
What would you do to your body?
You know,

2622
01:56:33,731 --> 01:56:38,731
like I've always been thin and athletic
and it was easy for me to do these

2623
01:56:39,421 --> 01:56:40,370
things.
So when I'm,

2624
01:56:40,371 --> 01:56:42,840
when I'm feeling this and I just started
to notice like,

2625
01:56:42,841 --> 01:56:44,430
Holy Shit,
what do I feel this way,

2626
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:47,040
why would damn this is getting worse and
worse,

2627
01:56:47,041 --> 01:56:51,570
and then I jumped up and grabbed the
bucket and puked my brains out like I'd

2628
01:56:51,571 --> 01:56:54,510
never puked before and it came out of
me,

2629
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:58,350
this feeling,
this animosity towards people and I

2630
01:56:58,351 --> 01:57:01,200
understood right then like they don't
know any better.

2631
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:06,950
I don't know how they got there,
but I do know that they don't know any

2632
01:57:07,261 --> 01:57:09,210
better.
I don't know how to get out of that.

2633
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:12,630
Then even if they do know
intellectually,

2634
01:57:12,631 --> 01:57:15,570
they haven't internalized it.
They haven't adjusted.

2635
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:17,400
Right.
There's plenty of things that you can

2636
01:57:17,401 --> 01:57:18,470
take at face value.

2637
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:20,220
You here resonates with you and you're
like,

2638
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:21,930
oh yeah,
that makes perfect sense.

2639
01:57:22,230 --> 01:57:24,000
Right.
But you don't assimilate it.

2640
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:26,910
Put it into action.
And I think for them,

2641
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:29,100
I don't know,
maybe every time their mom and dad

2642
01:57:29,101 --> 01:57:31,400
fought,
they took them to get ice cream cones

2643
01:57:31,401 --> 01:57:32,580
and McDonald's.
Oh that's okay.

2644
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:33,210
You know,
come on,

2645
01:57:33,210 --> 01:57:35,010
we'll go for a car ride.
It'll be fine.

2646
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,860
Here's an ice cream cone.
And then now anytime that under stress

2647
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:40,980
fucking eat ice cream and they don't
even think about it or maybe they do

2648
01:57:40,981 --> 01:57:42,870
know and they still say,
I don't care,

2649
01:57:42,871 --> 01:57:44,460
I know those ice cream I was going to
make me feel better,

2650
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:46,350
or whatever it is.
I don't know.

2651
01:57:46,351 --> 01:57:48,210
That's not my place to be like,
hey you fat,

2652
01:57:48,211 --> 01:57:49,050
fuck you.
You know,

2653
01:57:49,051 --> 01:57:52,830
like that helped me grow from that.
And that was a huge.

2654
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:54,090
That was like,
oh,

2655
01:57:54,090 --> 01:57:55,440
how could puking be good?

2656
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:58,530
And that puking is amazing when you're
getting rid of something like that.

2657
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:01,050
Right?
Like you're letting go of a thought that

2658
01:58:01,051 --> 01:58:03,120
you had like this attachment that you
had.

2659
01:58:03,630 --> 01:58:04,140
Yeah.
There's,

2660
01:58:04,140 --> 01:58:09,060
I mean there's a certain holier than
thou attitude that certain people with

2661
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:14,080
great metabolisms and active lifestyles
will have towards people that maybe they

2662
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:15,750
just,
when they grew up,

2663
01:58:15,751 --> 01:58:19,380
they weren't led towards athletics.
They maybe they were bullied.

2664
01:58:19,381 --> 01:58:20,214
Maybe they,
you know,

2665
01:58:20,230 --> 01:58:23,370
they had poor diets in the home and they
didn't know any better.

2666
01:58:23,610 --> 01:58:28,230
And now here they find themselves x
amount of years later a product to a

2667
01:58:28,231 --> 01:58:30,990
whole series of things.
I think of the impact it would have

2668
01:58:31,050 --> 01:58:33,740
always get picked last for kickball or
something,

2669
01:58:33,741 --> 01:58:36,420
handball or any of that stupid dumb
playground games.

2670
01:58:36,421 --> 01:58:39,420
You're always picked last.
You don't want to play them anymore.

2671
01:58:39,690 --> 01:58:41,180
You're not interested in that.
Yeah.

2672
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,200
It's an associate them

2673
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:45,640
with bad feelings.
I was having a conversation about this

2674
01:58:45,641 --> 01:58:50,641
with a friend of mine.
She was talking about like how there's

2675
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:56,500
like women that are like angry feminists
that get that truly don't like men.

2676
01:58:56,831 --> 01:58:58,900
They hate men and they don't like
masculinity.

2677
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:02,410
She was trying to figure out what that's
all about and I was like,

2678
01:59:02,411 --> 01:59:04,450
well,
the parallels got to be.

2679
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:08,020
There's certain men that I know that
don't like women.

2680
01:59:08,021 --> 01:59:10,930
They hate women and one of the reasons
why is because they've been rejected by

2681
01:59:10,931 --> 01:59:13,990
women their whole lives.
So they associate women with a negative

2682
01:59:13,991 --> 01:59:16,570
feeling.
They associate women with rejection.

2683
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:20,500
They associate women with the women,
like as cold hearted leaves them.

2684
01:59:20,501 --> 01:59:23,470
It goes with another guy.
Negotiation do that to me,

2685
01:59:23,471 --> 01:59:24,770
that bitch.
Well,

2686
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:26,170
it's.
She doesn't owe you.

2687
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,150
She's not attracted to you like you've
got.

2688
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:32,320
For whatever reason the universe dealt
you and extremely shitty deck of cards

2689
01:59:32,650 --> 01:59:37,650
and that's just the way it is,
but so forever this person that I know

2690
01:59:37,991 --> 01:59:42,550
that that has this issue,
his association with women is of women.

2691
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:45,640
The use him,
they want things from him.

2692
01:59:45,641 --> 01:59:47,980
His money,
they don't want him and they treat him

2693
01:59:47,981 --> 01:59:50,410
badly and he feels like shit and
hateful.

2694
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:55,560
Whereas I have friends that are good
looking guys that for no,

2695
01:59:56,770 --> 01:59:59,170
there's no reason.
They were just born good looking.

2696
01:59:59,350 --> 02:00:02,230
They just got great bone structure and
you know,

2697
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:06,070
they happen to look good and women are
attracted to them and their ideas of

2698
02:00:06,071 --> 02:00:08,670
women are totally different.
Their ideas of women are.

2699
02:00:08,700 --> 02:00:11,620
The chicks are fun.
The grade don't get tied down though,

2700
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:12,454
Bro.
You know,

2701
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:13,830
keep,
keep it moving.

2702
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:16,690
You know,
like their ideas of women are much more

2703
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:20,230
light and like women are there.
They're a gift.

2704
02:00:20,370 --> 02:00:23,420
There are a great thing in life.
They're not this evil to.

2705
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:28,620
So there's like this association can
often be correlated by what kind of a

2706
02:00:29,711 --> 02:00:32,290
relationship do you have with the
opposite sex.

2707
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,900
Like if you're a woman and you're
overweight and you're,

2708
02:00:35,230 --> 02:00:36,910
you know,
you've always been fat,

2709
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:42,040
your whole life has been like a series
of drunken moments with men who felt

2710
02:00:42,041 --> 02:00:45,700
sick after they were with you and you
were rejected and any man that you were

2711
02:00:45,701 --> 02:00:48,040
attracted to at wanted to have nothing
to do with you.

2712
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:53,160
So your feelings about men are just as
the angriest assholes.

2713
02:00:54,161 --> 02:00:58,050
These Bros,
these douchebags not taking into

2714
02:00:58,051 --> 02:00:59,340
consideration like,
well,

2715
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:01,630
what?
What is this relationship you have with

2716
02:01:01,631 --> 02:01:04,780
them and what's the root cause of it?
Some of it is outside of your.

2717
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:08,440
If it's just genetics completely outside
of your control,

2718
02:01:08,441 --> 02:01:12,430
there's nothing you can do about the way
your face looks or how tall you are,

2719
02:01:12,431 --> 02:01:13,710
how short you are,
how,

2720
02:01:14,070 --> 02:01:15,730
how big your feet are.
You know,

2721
02:01:15,731 --> 02:01:20,731
there's nothing you can do about that,
but the relationship between how,

2722
02:01:21,070 --> 02:01:24,610
what you look and how physically
attractive you are sexually,

2723
02:01:24,730 --> 02:01:26,770
like people's desire to reproduce with
you.

2724
02:01:26,770 --> 02:01:29,290
It really comes down to that in a lot of
ways.

2725
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:32,710
Like what is the relationship you have
with the opposite sex?

2726
02:01:32,980 --> 02:01:35,290
Because boy,
when you,

2727
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:39,040
when you go in and really pay attention
to like hardcore,

2728
02:01:39,830 --> 02:01:44,830
what you find is a lot of older
successful women and women that are

2729
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:48,800
overweight and not attractive and you
find,

2730
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:51,590
you know,
all sorts of different people in between

2731
02:01:51,591 --> 02:01:54,080
there,
but there's an overwhelming number of

2732
02:01:54,081 --> 02:01:57,350
people that have not had good success
with the opposite sex,

2733
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:02,560
both from women hating men and for men
hating women and it's like this is an

2734
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:05,170
extremely unfortunate,
you know,

2735
02:02:05,171 --> 02:02:07,460
if you look at it that way,
it's extremely unfortunate.

2736
02:02:07,461 --> 02:02:11,300
Like taking out gender inequality,
financial issues,

2737
02:02:11,301 --> 02:02:16,301
all sorts of issues that also come with
being a male men's rights advocate or a

2738
02:02:16,701 --> 02:02:19,010
woman's rights advocate,
a feminist.

2739
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:20,590
There's a,
there's an,

2740
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:25,220
an overall attitude that people have an
issue with when it comes to someone who

2741
02:02:25,221 --> 02:02:29,270
identifies with one gender or another
gender and despise the other gender.

2742
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:33,380
Oftentimes it's because their
associations and relationships with that

2743
02:02:33,381 --> 02:02:36,590
gender have been negative due to the
fact that they're not desired.

2744
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:39,620
That it's really.
It comes down to them.

2745
02:02:39,770 --> 02:02:42,740
And so what are,
what are you doing for yourself?

2746
02:02:43,730 --> 02:02:44,980
What is your relationship with that
part?

2747
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:47,300
With the opposite,
sex certainly has to do with that,

2748
02:02:47,301 --> 02:02:51,260
but what is your relationship in life?
Do you have this assumption that all

2749
02:02:51,261 --> 02:02:56,261
dudes are dicks and they all behave the
same way and in that it's kind of your

2750
02:02:57,111 --> 02:03:00,050
mindset can keep you stuck in that whole
just the same.

2751
02:03:00,250 --> 02:03:02,690
If you're always thinking like,
this is exactly how they are,

2752
02:03:02,691 --> 02:03:04,310
this is it.
This is exactly what it's going to

2753
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:06,440
reciprocate itself over and over and
over again.

2754
02:03:06,980 --> 02:03:09,080
So you're always correct.
Yeah,

2755
02:03:09,081 --> 02:03:11,300
there's that,
but then there's also the reality,

2756
02:03:11,301 --> 02:03:13,790
like my friend who doesn't live was not
my friend anymore,

2757
02:03:13,940 --> 02:03:15,380
but who doesn't like women?

2758
02:03:15,590 --> 02:03:18,710
He's an ugly dude,
so he's gonna be an ugly dude.

2759
02:03:19,150 --> 02:03:20,670
He'd see like porn.
Does he like,

2760
02:03:21,250 --> 02:03:22,750
does he like.
No,

2761
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:25,070
it's not like he doesn't like,
he gets angry,

2762
02:03:25,370 --> 02:03:26,330
he gets angry.
He's like,

2763
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:29,150
it never has a girlfriend.
He's never been married.

2764
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:33,230
He's just like always like that.
It sounds to me like a guy who used to

2765
02:03:33,231 --> 02:03:34,420
work on himself.
Oh,

2766
02:03:34,421 --> 02:03:37,850
he definitely does,
but it's also like the girls that he

2767
02:03:37,851 --> 02:03:39,650
likes,
they'd never really were into.

2768
02:03:39,660 --> 02:03:44,660
I'm just just not attractive.
It's got to shit roll the dice is roll

2769
02:03:45,330 --> 02:03:48,560
the dice sucks.
Don't know where I'm going with this.

2770
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:49,921
Well,
but uh,

2771
02:03:49,921 --> 02:03:53,090
what I'm trying to say is I'm not trying
to say anything,

2772
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:56,000
but if I was trying to say anything I
would try to say like there's,

2773
02:03:56,050 --> 02:04:01,050
there's a lot of complex issues that are
going on with how people feel about

2774
02:04:01,911 --> 02:04:04,190
themselves and how they feel about other
people.

2775
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:08,540
And oftentimes what they blame other
people for is really some shit that's

2776
02:04:08,541 --> 02:04:11,300
going on with them.
Like they find enemies out there

2777
02:04:11,301 --> 02:04:15,500
external enemies to distract themselves
from their internal problems and

2778
02:04:15,501 --> 02:04:20,180
failures and shortcomings big time.
Like you find that a lot with haters.

2779
02:04:20,390 --> 02:04:24,440
I'm sure you found that when you've read
like horrible shit that people write

2780
02:04:24,441 --> 02:04:27,800
about you online like after fights.
Like dude,

2781
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:31,850
I mean look,
the kind of hate that is available to

2782
02:04:31,851 --> 02:04:36,851
fighters is some of the most fucking
vicious and personal and emotional.

2783
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:40,980
The people that go after them,
like quote unquote fans.

2784
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:43,350
Yeah.
Every one of them is a loser.

2785
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:45,630
Every one of them,
every one of them.

2786
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:50,840
Every fucking evil nasty Douche bag that
seeks you out to say mean shit to you

2787
02:04:52,291 --> 02:04:55,200
after a loss and tweets at you.
You know,

2788
02:04:55,201 --> 02:04:58,410
and so,
I mean I've seen some horrific shit that

2789
02:04:58,460 --> 02:04:59,160
guy's right.

2790
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:04,050
Two fighters directly after a loss both
on facebook and on instagram,

2791
02:05:04,140 --> 02:05:04,980
twitter,
everything.

2792
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:08,850
Those people are all unsuccessful.
They're all failures.

2793
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:10,950
All of them.
That's the only reason why they would do

2794
02:05:10,951 --> 02:05:12,240
that.
It's one thing to say,

2795
02:05:12,241 --> 02:05:14,040
man,
you know that fucking guy,

2796
02:05:14,070 --> 02:05:15,860
he got killed or man,
you know,

2797
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:18,420
that guy got tapped quick or how good is
this guy?

2798
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:20,400
Man,
I can't believe he ran through that guy

2799
02:05:20,401 --> 02:05:24,120
like this.
Those are like almost a analytical

2800
02:05:24,121 --> 02:05:27,000
discussions that you have with people
where things happen and you didn't see a

2801
02:05:27,001 --> 02:05:28,230
comment like,
okay,

2802
02:05:28,231 --> 02:05:32,280
Ryan Bader versus rumble Johnson like
that fight without saying anything

2803
02:05:32,281 --> 02:05:34,560
horrible about Ryan Bader.
You'd go,

2804
02:05:34,561 --> 02:05:36,210
fuck man,
rumble Johnson.

2805
02:05:36,211 --> 02:05:38,520
Jesus crushed you.
Just random over man.

2806
02:05:38,670 --> 02:05:40,800
Fuck who can take that guy shots and
you,

2807
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:45,150
that's a got a non asshole way of
approaching it.

2808
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:48,810
But good Lord,
I read some Shit online that people

2809
02:05:48,811 --> 02:05:51,540
tweeted to him to bader and like,
you fucking,

2810
02:05:51,541 --> 02:05:52,980
you should be in a jail somewhere.

2811
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:54,650
You're a monster.
Like you're,

2812
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:59,370
you're looking at this guy like here's a
downed wounded thing and I'm going to

2813
02:05:59,371 --> 02:06:01,350
just piss on him.
I'm going to find a spot,

2814
02:06:01,351 --> 02:06:03,690
a soft spot,
and I'm a jab him with sticks.

2815
02:06:03,990 --> 02:06:05,700
I'm going to see if I could fuck with
his head.

2816
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:07,530
You know,
and anybody who does that,

2817
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:09,360
those people that are doing that,
those haters,

2818
02:06:09,690 --> 02:06:12,120
they're all losers.
It's the saddest thing about it.

2819
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:16,680
It's like they're looking at this one
person,

2820
02:06:16,681 --> 02:06:18,180
this one thing,
this,

2821
02:06:18,181 --> 02:06:22,980
this object that they can attack and
they're externalizing all the issues

2822
02:06:22,981 --> 02:06:26,310
they have with themselves,
the imbalances they have,

2823
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:30,510
and then this new ability that we have
to reach people and communicate with

2824
02:06:30,511 --> 02:06:32,400
people that really don't want to have
anything to do with you.

2825
02:06:32,810 --> 02:06:33,960
You know,
in the real world.

2826
02:06:33,961 --> 02:06:35,940
Ryan Bader doesn't give a fuck about
this guy's opinion.

2827
02:06:35,941 --> 02:06:37,320
He doesn't know I'm in the real world.

2828
02:06:37,330 --> 02:06:39,410
Nobody's saying shit to his face.
Like,

2829
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:40,920
oh my God,
I think that's Ryan Bader.

2830
02:06:40,950 --> 02:06:42,950
They run up to him and just blow him
right there.

2831
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:44,490
So cool.
You're so fucking awesome.

2832
02:06:45,050 --> 02:06:45,990
You know?
Serious.

2833
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:48,150
Same exact guy.
Same exact guy.

2834
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:49,800
Boy.
Some hateful people out there,

2835
02:06:49,801 --> 02:06:52,470
man.
I know so many fighters just don't go on

2836
02:06:52,471 --> 02:06:55,140
social media now because of it.
You know,

2837
02:06:55,220 --> 02:06:56,830
you would think photos are tough.
They should feel.

2838
02:06:56,831 --> 02:06:57,664
Could toughen up.
Like

2839
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:01,620
maybe you're just a con.
Maybe it's not.

2840
02:07:01,621 --> 02:07:03,900
Fighters are tough and they should just
toughen up.

2841
02:07:04,110 --> 02:07:06,090
Maybe it's like what you're doing,
you're,

2842
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:08,160
you're being shitty to someone you don't
even know.

2843
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:11,340
Again,
where am I going with this?

2844
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:13,170
I don't know.
I completely agree.

2845
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:15,870
I've even when I,
when we forget who it was,

2846
02:07:15,910 --> 02:07:20,850
green flower media did a thing on me
talking about cannabis and cbd and how

2847
02:07:20,851 --> 02:07:23,110
many guys in the sport use and just,
you know,

2848
02:07:23,210 --> 02:07:25,560
not naming names and Jose conseco
showing it,

2849
02:07:25,561 --> 02:07:29,640
but talking about a lot of smoke pot,
like it helps us sleep at night helps

2850
02:07:29,670 --> 02:07:32,820
turn off our brain when we're
overthinking shit and you got something

2851
02:07:32,821 --> 02:07:37,821
big coming up.
I'm more than obviously now with Usada

2852
02:07:38,010 --> 02:07:39,400
and things like that.
There's a lot less,

2853
02:07:39,401 --> 02:07:40,390
but back in the day.
Yeah,

2854
02:07:40,460 --> 02:07:43,330
fucking,
there was a lot of us out of

2855
02:07:43,370 --> 02:07:44,500
competition.
You,

2856
02:07:44,510 --> 02:07:48,070
you,
you can smoke pot and in competition

2857
02:07:48,071 --> 02:07:50,920
like you can smoke pot up until like the
week of the fight.

2858
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:53,590
And this is good news for me to tell to
tell people.

2859
02:07:53,650 --> 02:07:54,461
Yeah.
But yeah,

2860
02:07:54,461 --> 02:07:58,180
we did that video and then sure enough,
I didn't know it was going to get

2861
02:07:58,510 --> 02:08:00,280
decent.
Not that it went big,

2862
02:08:00,281 --> 02:08:04,540
but Bj Penn Dot com ran it and it made
it bigger than it was.

2863
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:06,940
And of course,
and the bottom of the video,

2864
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:09,770
everyone's comments.
I got like two or three guys.

2865
02:08:09,771 --> 02:08:10,920
I was like,
oh no,

2866
02:08:10,921 --> 02:08:14,590
this is a site.
Oh No.

2867
02:08:15,150 --> 02:08:16,320
It didn't help him.
Uh,

2868
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:19,300
with Jimmy men will pay a,
smashed his face and did it.

2869
02:08:19,301 --> 02:08:20,470
He wasn't smoked that,
you know,

2870
02:08:20,471 --> 02:08:21,430
it's like,
Oh God,

2871
02:08:21,431 --> 02:08:22,800
like how does this have anything to do
with,

2872
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:25,600
with what we're talking about here has
nothing to do with anything.

2873
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:26,890
But it's funny.
It's like,

2874
02:08:26,891 --> 02:08:28,570
Oh,
let me allow me to,

2875
02:08:28,571 --> 02:08:30,910
uh,
allow me to knock it down here.

2876
02:08:30,911 --> 02:08:32,110
A couple,
a couple of pegs.

2877
02:08:32,111 --> 02:08:33,460
Well,
while we're talking,

2878
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:35,290
you know,
well there's also people that don't

2879
02:08:35,291 --> 02:08:38,170
recognize what they're doing and they
just,

2880
02:08:38,410 --> 02:08:39,730
they're just talking,
you know,

2881
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:42,460
just making noises and they're not even,
they're not evil,

2882
02:08:42,490 --> 02:08:47,380
they just don't realize what they're
saying is hurtful or stupid or idiotic

2883
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:51,220
because they've been given this access
to people that's unprecedented.

2884
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:53,460
There's no training for this.
Like no one,

2885
02:08:53,490 --> 02:08:56,050
no one had anything like social media
and our parents' days.

2886
02:08:56,051 --> 02:08:59,500
It just didn't exist.
So they never taught us about it.

2887
02:08:59,501 --> 02:09:02,230
That's one thing,
thinking about having kids,

2888
02:09:02,260 --> 02:09:04,870
like I look at bear now and I'm like,
fuck dude,

2889
02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:08,680
we,
we grew up when you had wired telephones

2890
02:09:08,710 --> 02:09:12,190
and then we saw a giant,
Zach Morris cell phones come into play

2891
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:14,950
and we had the car phone and like things
like that,

2892
02:09:14,951 --> 02:09:17,290
you know,
and then just this evolution over time,

2893
02:09:17,291 --> 02:09:20,590
like they're born,
they're not knowing a world without

2894
02:09:20,591 --> 02:09:22,780
internet,
without instant access.

2895
02:09:22,970 --> 02:09:24,550
Grandparents,
same thing.

2896
02:09:24,551 --> 02:09:25,231
They were like,
Bar,

2897
02:09:25,231 --> 02:09:27,700
remember when you,
how to take a boat to get here from

2898
02:09:27,701 --> 02:09:28,960
Europe.
And then,

2899
02:09:28,961 --> 02:09:31,200
you know,
we grew up in a much more technically

2900
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:34,150
technologically advanced era,
but our kids are going to grow up in an

2901
02:09:34,151 --> 02:09:39,151
era that's mind blowing to us,
but their kids are gonna grow up in an

2902
02:09:39,191 --> 02:09:42,280
era of virtual reality that makes this
look like a joke.

2903
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:45,160
It makes our video games like stupid,
you know?

2904
02:09:45,161 --> 02:09:47,050
Yeah.
My Dad's always brag about how awesome

2905
02:09:47,051 --> 02:09:48,460
mafia three was.
Listen,

2906
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:51,220
you know,
I had to sit in front of a box like I'm

2907
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:53,180
in the fucking Star Trek Room,
right?

2908
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:55,210
Surrounded by killers right now.
Yeah.

2909
02:09:55,211 --> 02:09:58,780
We're probably going to go to places
just like those old swartz and egg or

2910
02:09:58,781 --> 02:10:01,180
movies or any of those movies.
You're going to probably go to a place.

2911
02:10:01,330 --> 02:10:04,270
You're going to lie down,
they're going to clamp some shit down on

2912
02:10:04,271 --> 02:10:05,980
the side of your head and you go,
are you ready,

2913
02:10:05,981 --> 02:10:09,910
Mr Kingsberry give me the thumbs up.
If you're ready to launch and you give

2914
02:10:09,911 --> 02:10:12,610
the thumbs up.
And usually you're in the avatar world

2915
02:10:12,790 --> 02:10:14,980
and you're riding a fucking dragon.
You know what I mean?

2916
02:10:15,010 --> 02:10:18,820
That's Gunna happen inside of the next
hundred years.

2917
02:10:18,850 --> 02:10:22,540
It's a 100 percent going to happen.
It's just a matter of time.

2918
02:10:22,570 --> 02:10:24,880
If they keep going,
we don't blow ourselves up.

2919
02:10:24,881 --> 02:10:27,880
We don't get hit by an asteroid.
They're going to come up with artificial

2920
02:10:27,881 --> 02:10:31,390
reality that is indistinguishable from
this reality and all of our

2921
02:10:31,391 --> 02:10:33,070
entertainment is going to be a joke.
Like,

2922
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:37,430
why would you actually jump out of a
plane and go skydiving when you can get

2923
02:10:37,431 --> 02:10:41,060
the skydiving experience with this thing
on your head.

2924
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:44,690
It's gonna make you feel like you did.
That was that movie a

2925
02:10:46,370 --> 02:10:47,900
total recall?
Strange days.

2926
02:10:48,110 --> 02:10:49,340
Oh yeah,
that's right.

2927
02:10:49,341 --> 02:10:50,720
Right.
You could fit into it and they had like

2928
02:10:50,721 --> 02:10:55,721
snuff videos where a guy would actually
kill somebody and you felt what he felt

2929
02:10:55,731 --> 02:10:58,530
when he killed another person,
like you felt all the neurotransmitters.

2930
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:02,570
Everything was going through your brain
to the heart racing feeling of actually

2931
02:11:02,571 --> 02:11:05,780
ending someone's life and you know,
that was the illegal portion of it.

2932
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:09,170
Then they had the legal portion would be
like sex with your loved one or

2933
02:11:09,171 --> 02:11:09,620
whatever.

2934
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:12,770
Those kinds of things,
but you could actually tap into the

2935
02:11:12,771 --> 02:11:15,830
consciousness of someone's memory as
long as that was recorded.

2936
02:11:16,670 --> 02:11:19,580
I think that's going to happen.
I think it's definitely gonna happen.

2937
02:11:20,190 --> 02:11:22,880
Uh,
it's just a matter of time if they keep

2938
02:11:22,881 --> 02:11:27,200
going,
it's a matter of one invention and one

2939
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:31,850
discovery makes way for another
intervention and another discovery that

2940
02:11:31,851 --> 02:11:34,190
compound on each other.
They build on each other.

2941
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:37,430
And next thing you know,
reality is unrecognizable.

2942
02:11:37,490 --> 02:11:39,560
Like the reality that we experience
today.

2943
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:41,510
No,
we're talking about these primitive

2944
02:11:41,511 --> 02:11:44,590
diets,
primal existence and you know,

2945
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:47,150
how our bodies,
the idea behind all of this is obviously

2946
02:11:47,151 --> 02:11:50,360
that our bodies,
it takes thousands of years.

2947
02:11:50,361 --> 02:11:54,620
They say about 10,000 years for your
genes to totally change and adapt to new

2948
02:11:54,621 --> 02:11:55,790
diet,
new environment,

2949
02:11:55,791 --> 02:11:59,300
new lifestyle.
And so we're dealing with bodies that

2950
02:11:59,301 --> 02:12:03,950
are primarily adjusted to a hunter
gatherer lifestyle and all this other

2951
02:12:03,951 --> 02:12:06,020
stuff that we've added into it over the
last 10,

2952
02:12:06,021 --> 02:12:08,240
20,000 years or whatever,
agriculture,

2953
02:12:08,270 --> 02:12:11,420
grains,
growing different foods that you could

2954
02:12:11,930 --> 02:12:14,450
keep them in storage bins and things
like that,

2955
02:12:14,451 --> 02:12:15,380
like grain silos.

2956
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:18,500
That's all fairly reason.
It's and you know,

2957
02:12:18,501 --> 02:12:20,540
yes,
you can live like that for sure.

2958
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:21,650
Yeah.
Grains or.

2959
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:22,663
Yeah,
he can eat it,

2960
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:25,880
but what is your body like optimized
for?

2961
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,160
What is,
what is your body exists with the least

2962
02:12:28,161 --> 02:12:30,110
amount of hiccups?
Well,

2963
02:12:30,111 --> 02:12:32,360
it's probably the stuff that's like
super,

2964
02:12:32,860 --> 02:12:36,950
like clean and normal like fish,
vegetables,

2965
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:38,180
chicken,
meat,

2966
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:41,420
things along those lines.
The stuff that we haven't fucked with

2967
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,190
farm raised this and that.
No,

2968
02:12:43,580 --> 02:12:43,910
no,
no.

2969
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:47,570
Farm raised fish.
Eating genetically modified soybeans and

2970
02:12:47,571 --> 02:12:48,404
whatever,
you know,

2971
02:12:48,450 --> 02:12:51,830
just what's the most realist food we can
put on our body.

2972
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:52,721
Well,
you,

2973
02:12:52,721 --> 02:12:54,620
you,
you probably go camping and shit too,

2974
02:12:54,621 --> 02:12:55,220
right?
Do you?

2975
02:12:55,220 --> 02:12:56,053
Yeah.
Yeah.

2976
02:12:56,150 --> 02:12:58,880
You know that feeling you get when
you're out in the woods when you don't,

2977
02:12:58,881 --> 02:13:03,350
you don't have any cell phone signal
with any ala mushrooms that too.

2978
02:13:03,620 --> 02:13:05,030
Well that's,
that's extreme.

2979
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:07,730
But just even being alone,
like you hear the

2980
02:13:09,620 --> 02:13:11,240
nothing,
you have nothing.

2981
02:13:11,241 --> 02:13:13,970
You hear the real nothing.
The real nothing of the woods.

2982
02:13:14,270 --> 02:13:18,890
It's almost like scary because you
realize like,

2983
02:13:18,891 --> 02:13:21,440
this forest doesn't give a fuck about
me.

2984
02:13:21,670 --> 02:13:24,170
If a tree falls in your head and you die
right there,

2985
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:27,980
the forest doesn't skip a beat.
The squirrels and chipmunks keep running

2986
02:13:27,981 --> 02:13:28,820
around.
The birds.

2987
02:13:28,821 --> 02:13:30,590
Keep flying.
The deer keep running.

2988
02:13:30,770 --> 02:13:33,410
It's the same.
It literally does not matter does it?

2989
02:13:33,450 --> 02:13:36,000
It's been like this before you.
It will be like this.

2990
02:13:36,001 --> 02:13:38,280
Unless we fuck it up.
It'll be like this after you.

2991
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:40,290
This is just the way.
If we fuck it up,

2992
02:13:40,291 --> 02:13:43,650
it'll go back to that at some point or
something different and it'll become

2993
02:13:43,651 --> 02:13:46,200
something different.
Some some new form of nature,

2994
02:13:46,770 --> 02:13:51,770
but you go from that to like cities and
cities have this bizarre,

2995
02:13:52,351 --> 02:13:53,700
strange,
different kind of life.

2996
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:56,730
Like I was in Manhattan last weekend.
It's fucking awesome.

2997
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,180
It's awesome to visit.
He'd go there.

2998
02:13:59,190 --> 02:14:01,890
You're like,
you're going from one place to another

2999
02:14:01,891 --> 02:14:06,480
in this restaurant that building and
look at this view and Holy Shit and get

3000
02:14:06,481 --> 02:14:11,100
on a subway and you're cruising along
under the buildings and it's awesome,

3001
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:13,770
but it's awesome in a completely
different way.

3002
02:14:13,771 --> 02:14:15,120
It's awesome.
In this new way,

3003
02:14:15,121 --> 02:14:17,670
this new bizarre way that we're sort of
adapting to,

3004
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:22,020
you know,
and this new way is available to us and

3005
02:14:22,021 --> 02:14:24,060
wasn't available to people 10,000 years
ago.

3006
02:14:24,061 --> 02:14:27,810
This was a mindblower if you took
someone from 10,000 years ago and

3007
02:14:27,811 --> 02:14:32,811
brought on a Manhattan and just put them
in like the 72nd floor of one of those

3008
02:14:32,881 --> 02:14:35,550
apartment buildings with the crazy view.
Just look out,

3009
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:36,930
look out at the city.
Be like,

3010
02:14:37,350 --> 02:14:40,350
what in the fuck am I seeing?
You know,

3011
02:14:40,710 --> 02:14:42,810
like you've been to vegas.
You ever been like the top of,

3012
02:14:42,811 --> 02:14:44,430
uh,
the Mandalay bay,

3013
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:48,060
that bar that's up there that has the
crazy view and the glass floor.

3014
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:49,710
Oh yeah.
Fuck.

3015
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:52,410
He just look out at the top of that
building.

3016
02:14:52,420 --> 02:14:53,540
You're like,
God,

3017
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:56,190
this is insane.
This is like some,

3018
02:14:56,790 --> 02:14:57,860
oh shit.
Yeah.

3019
02:15:00,090 --> 02:15:03,480
We're experiencing something that no,
no cultures ever experienced.

3020
02:15:03,481 --> 02:15:06,930
We're experiencing something that no
generation has ever experienced this.

3021
02:15:06,931 --> 02:15:10,860
The technological heights that we're
living in and this ain't shit compared

3022
02:15:10,861 --> 02:15:12,150
to what our kids are going to
experience.

3023
02:15:12,210 --> 02:15:12,661
Well,
the,

3024
02:15:12,661 --> 02:15:16,550
hopefully there are intelligent people
like Marxists on another,

3025
02:15:16,580 --> 02:15:20,100
guys that continue to push the envelope
to reconnect.

3026
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,950
You know,
like there is a reason that we feel

3027
02:15:22,951 --> 02:15:26,100
amazing at the beach.
Not everyone has access to the beach,

3028
02:15:26,101 --> 02:15:29,580
but there's a reason we feel amazing at
the beach and scientifically they're

3029
02:15:29,581 --> 02:15:32,220
showing now with negative ions and the
energy,

3030
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:35,850
the energy of the earth like it.
It has an impact on how we feel the

3031
02:15:35,851 --> 02:15:38,670
beach does.
The ocean does for sure.

3032
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:42,650
The wind coming off the ocean does.
So even if you were on a boat out over

3033
02:15:42,660 --> 02:15:45,240
the water,
you're going to feel better just from

3034
02:15:45,241 --> 02:15:46,074
doing that.

3035
02:15:46,110 --> 02:15:48,330
What does it do?
Like what specifically does it do to

3036
02:15:48,331 --> 02:15:51,900
you?
From what I read and I understand there

3037
02:15:52,110 --> 02:15:55,440
are an abundance of negative ions,
so from an electrical standpoint,

3038
02:15:55,470 --> 02:16:00,470
you're talking again about the human
energy field and auras and shallcross

3039
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:03,390
bro.
Chakra here.

3040
02:16:03,391 --> 02:16:05,730
Just going to feel more alive like
every,

3041
02:16:05,731 --> 02:16:09,480
every part of you.
I can't describe like from a feeling

3042
02:16:09,481 --> 02:16:11,340
standpoint,
everyone has their experience at the

3043
02:16:11,341 --> 02:16:13,800
ocean,
but from an electrical standpoint you

3044
02:16:13,801 --> 02:16:16,680
would say like you are,
you're clearing out blockages from your

3045
02:16:16,681 --> 02:16:18,540
ci,
from a Chinese medicine standpoint,

3046
02:16:18,541 --> 02:16:22,620
from a Kundalini and yoga standpoint,
you're going to clear out blockages the

3047
02:16:22,621 --> 02:16:26,370
same way and you're just are those
blockages are the is this is a really a

3048
02:16:26,371 --> 02:16:31,371
blockage or you just experiencing from
the ocean and it feels good.

3049
02:16:32,530 --> 02:16:34,390
Maybe both.
Maybe there is no blockage,

3050
02:16:34,420 --> 02:16:38,680
but I'm willing to bet from somebody who
sits too long or has stressed,

3051
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:40,030
you know,
and different things like that.

3052
02:16:40,030 --> 02:16:44,920
Like they're very much can be a physical
attachment to emotion and if you've ever

3053
02:16:44,921 --> 02:16:48,310
had like bodywork done or somebody you
have a,

3054
02:16:48,570 --> 02:16:50,140
you know,
somebody is working to and not and you

3055
02:16:50,141 --> 02:16:53,380
all of a sudden start thinking of this
thing that's been bothering you in your

3056
02:16:53,381 --> 02:16:55,360
head,
a relationship,

3057
02:16:55,361 --> 02:16:58,090
whatever.
That there is physical attachments to

3058
02:16:58,180 --> 02:17:00,580
mental and emotional things that go on
in your,

3059
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:02,140
in your head.
So.

3060
02:17:02,170 --> 02:17:07,120
So when you get a massage and like the
of like a knot and they work through it,

3061
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:09,070
you think there's emotions tied up in
that?

3062
02:17:09,071 --> 02:17:10,030
Not.
Not always,

3063
02:17:10,090 --> 02:17:11,170
but sometimes.
Really?

3064
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:12,190
Yeah,
sure.

3065
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:14,230
How's that work?
I don't know how it works.

3066
02:17:14,650 --> 02:17:16,950
I don't know why.
I don't know why it would manifest

3067
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:19,930
there.
I don't know why we have an electrical

3068
02:17:19,931 --> 02:17:24,100
field that we do.
I don't believe that there's emotions

3069
02:17:24,101 --> 02:17:26,980
tied up in knots in your body.

3070
02:17:26,980 --> 02:17:30,640
I think when you get rid of those knots,
it relaxes you and that helps you deal

3071
02:17:30,641 --> 02:17:32,590
with emotions better.
Okay.

3072
02:17:32,650 --> 02:17:34,730
Maybe we went down the wrong path there.
Does that make sense?

3073
02:17:34,750 --> 02:17:36,130
Say Yes.
I agree with that.

3074
02:17:36,550 --> 02:17:39,950
From a feel good standpoint,
feeling better at the ocean might just

3075
02:17:39,970 --> 02:17:42,190
be the view.
But from an electrical standpoint,

3076
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:44,380
there are.
And this one goes back to the studies

3077
02:17:44,381 --> 02:17:46,780
done at Ucla,
there very much is an electrical

3078
02:17:46,781 --> 02:17:50,980
standpoint that that changes from the
ionic energy coming from the waves

3079
02:17:50,981 --> 02:17:53,440
coming from the water coming from the
wind that's above the water,

3080
02:17:53,710 --> 02:17:55,840
right?
Because like yoga talk,

3081
02:17:55,841 --> 02:17:58,780
they'll say shit to you.
Like this hip opener is gonna.

3082
02:17:58,810 --> 02:18:01,360
Make you feel,
feel better about your childhood.

3083
02:18:01,361 --> 02:18:03,750
It's gonna.
Open up emotional blockages and you're

3084
02:18:03,751 --> 02:18:06,070
like,
I'm pretty sure we're just stretching.

3085
02:18:06,220 --> 02:18:08,290
Yeah,
well that's just talking about root

3086
02:18:08,291 --> 02:18:11,020
Chakra and exactly how the different
Chakras work,

3087
02:18:11,021 --> 02:18:12,730
what they correlate to and things like
that.

3088
02:18:12,760 --> 02:18:17,380
I don't know necessarily in a visionary
state.

3089
02:18:17,470 --> 02:18:19,930
I can see energy.
I don't see colors.

3090
02:18:19,931 --> 02:18:20,830
I don't see like,
Oh,

3091
02:18:20,831 --> 02:18:22,600
here's my heart Chakra or something like
that.

3092
02:18:22,601 --> 02:18:25,180
But I have seen trees communicate to one
another,

3093
02:18:25,950 --> 02:18:29,740
like vibrations coming from the treetops
as they were talking to one another.

3094
02:18:29,890 --> 02:18:31,150
What is it like?
What does it look like?

3095
02:18:31,670 --> 02:18:33,550
I'm like,
ripples and water,

3096
02:18:34,990 --> 02:18:39,580
but it's the air that's rippling and you
could see like perfect circles coming

3097
02:18:39,610 --> 02:18:41,950
from the tops of the tree tops.
There was something I tweeted the other

3098
02:18:41,951 --> 02:18:42,784
day.
They,

3099
02:18:43,190 --> 02:18:47,200
they found that Venus fly traps do
calculations.

3100
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:53,040
They count like for some study they
figured out some,

3101
02:18:53,410 --> 02:18:56,770
uh,
some method of measuring the fact that

3102
02:18:56,830 --> 02:19:01,830
they actually count things there.
They're doing calculations like that.

3103
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:03,570
They're not smart.
They're,

3104
02:19:03,590 --> 02:19:06,050
there is an intelligence plants.
That's just,

3105
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:08,910
that's what I left at.
The argument from vegans on,

3106
02:19:08,950 --> 02:19:12,940
from from a consciousness standpoint,
whatever spark we have,

3107
02:19:12,970 --> 02:19:15,890
call it soul,
call it whatever plants have it,

3108
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:16,833
whatever.

3109
02:19:16,930 --> 02:19:20,860
Whatever animates us and gives us
us.

3110
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:22,810
It's in them too.
Yeah,

3111
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:24,100
for sure.
For sure.

3112
02:19:24,101 --> 02:19:24,934
Is this.
It's.

3113
02:19:25,140 --> 02:19:27,500
They don't.
They can't communicate in a that we can

3114
02:19:27,501 --> 02:19:29,360
clearly understand.
They don't bark at us,

3115
02:19:29,510 --> 02:19:31,610
they don't look at us with sad puppy dog
eyes,

3116
02:19:32,030 --> 02:19:36,680
but there's something alive in them.
Some strange way that they communicate

3117
02:19:36,681 --> 02:19:40,910
and that they absorb energy and life and
that you get that from them.

3118
02:19:40,911 --> 02:19:42,440
Let me.
Life eats life.

3119
02:19:42,650 --> 02:19:45,860
But that said,
I know many people that have had a

3120
02:19:45,890 --> 02:19:48,350
visionary experiences and became Vegan
afterwards.

3121
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:49,490
Yeah,
that's actually,

3122
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:56,360
that's actually really common,
especially in people that do multiple

3123
02:19:56,361 --> 02:20:00,100
Iowaska ceremonies and I had a vision.
My only vision I've ever had a bears.

3124
02:20:00,110 --> 02:20:04,970
I had a vision of seeing a panda bear
eats bamboo and then I saw a black bear

3125
02:20:04,971 --> 02:20:06,530
eating berries and I was like,
Oh fuck,

3126
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:07,393
am I going to be Vegan?

3127
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:10,610
And then I saw grizzly snatch and salmon
out and I was like,

3128
02:20:10,611 --> 02:20:13,610
oh.
And it was just the eat the natural,

3129
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:15,440
whatever it is.
There's no right or wrong,

3130
02:20:15,441 --> 02:20:17,720
but eat,
take from take from me.

3131
02:20:17,780 --> 02:20:19,760
This is mother earth talking to me.
Take from me.

3132
02:20:20,510 --> 02:20:22,010
Yeah.
So that's what it was.

3133
02:20:22,011 --> 02:20:22,910
It wasn't.
This is right.

3134
02:20:22,911 --> 02:20:25,280
That's wrong.
Every animal needs different things.

3135
02:20:25,281 --> 02:20:29,390
You know,
there's always these front of Erin

3136
02:20:29,390 --> 02:20:33,030
Simpson for I think he posted a giant
gorilla and he's like,

3137
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:34,550
no,
no enough protein in my diet,

3138
02:20:34,551 --> 02:20:37,070
bro.
This 800 pound gorilla,

3139
02:20:37,360 --> 02:20:38,060
you know.
And it's like,

3140
02:20:38,060 --> 02:20:40,700
hey look,
there's no,

3141
02:20:40,970 --> 02:20:43,250
there's no right or wrong here.
Like you're not going to go to the,

3142
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:44,540
to the line and say,
Oh,

3143
02:20:44,541 --> 02:20:46,460
you're doing this all wrong.
Lion here.

3144
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:48,040
Eat some grass instead.
Like,

3145
02:20:48,110 --> 02:20:48,943
come on.
No,

3146
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:51,020
it's fine.
As long as it's from nature,

3147
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:54,050
besides take it is a totally different
animal.

3148
02:20:54,250 --> 02:20:55,880
It's not a person like,
you know,

3149
02:20:56,120 --> 02:20:59,330
they have a chemical standpoint,
they're going to break down things.

3150
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:02,450
We can't break down with that.
They just depends on added to our debt

3151
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:04,730
so that people love that argument.
Look,

3152
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:09,800
strong grills are bro Roots Shit.
Why don't you go pull shit out of a

3153
02:21:09,801 --> 02:21:11,720
swamp?
And eat the stem,

3154
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:14,990
like the chew on stems.
What else do they do?

3155
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:17,330
They also have one inch dicks about
that.

3156
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:19,950
A lot of bad things about being a
gorilla.

3157
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:23,010
I Dunno,
I just think that um,

3158
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:27,560
factory farming is something that people
recognize a lot when they have

3159
02:21:27,561 --> 02:21:31,580
psychedelic experiences.
The connection between the suffering of

3160
02:21:31,581 --> 02:21:33,830
their food.
And that's real.

3161
02:21:33,950 --> 02:21:36,350
I've had multiple versions of that for
sure.

3162
02:21:36,710 --> 02:21:38,090
That's as real as it gets.
Multiple.

3163
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:40,400
And that's not fun.
It's not like you watched that and

3164
02:21:40,401 --> 02:21:41,660
you're like,
oh,

3165
02:21:41,661 --> 02:21:42,650
like you're watching a movie.

3166
02:21:42,650 --> 02:21:44,540
It's not like watching the cove and then
Washington,

3167
02:21:44,541 --> 02:21:47,090
the cove is hard enough.
But when you experience it,

3168
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:49,850
you feel what it's like.
You embody that consciousness.

3169
02:21:49,970 --> 02:21:51,410
Yeah.
And you know,

3170
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:55,190
they know they're all fucking aware.
They're not just these dumb things like

3171
02:21:55,350 --> 02:21:58,580
we're going to need some whatever they
provide for me.

3172
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:01,100
Oh you know,
like my buddies on the chopping block,

3173
02:22:01,101 --> 02:22:02,630
like I'm stuck here shoulder to
shoulder.

3174
02:22:02,631 --> 02:22:04,700
Like you feel you can feel that and tap
into that.

3175
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:08,630
And I don't know how that's going to
stop that.

3176
02:22:08,750 --> 02:22:13,750
That seems to be ingrained in our idea
of feeding cities.

3177
02:22:14,210 --> 02:22:19,210
It seems like the only way they can
produce enough meat to feed all these

3178
02:22:19,551 --> 02:22:22,970
fucking people in these cities,
the way they're doing it now is to

3179
02:22:22,971 --> 02:22:27,730
continue this factory farming method.
It's just terrific.

3180
02:22:27,790 --> 02:22:32,400
In the movie food inc.
Awesome documentary and the end is hey,

3181
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:33,480
like,
yeah,

3182
02:22:33,510 --> 02:22:34,320
it's fucked.

3183
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:35,850
WhAt do we do?
What do we do now?

3184
02:22:35,851 --> 02:22:39,540
You do vote with your dollar,
so every time you say,

3185
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:43,890
I can't even taste the difference
between free range eggs and these caged

3186
02:22:43,891 --> 02:22:45,300
eggs,
I'm going to save a few bucks.

3187
02:22:45,780 --> 02:22:48,630
You vote with your dollar.
Like if you spend a little extra,

3188
02:22:48,690 --> 02:22:52,170
you're going to feel better from it,
but also you're going to help change the

3189
02:22:52,171 --> 02:22:55,770
culture and they show walmart show
having a organic,

3190
02:22:56,180 --> 02:22:59,160
a yogurt or something on the shelves.
Just because there's demand there.

3191
02:22:59,180 --> 02:23:01,110
I mean if you go into costco,
here in California,

3192
02:23:01,470 --> 02:23:06,470
they have all kinds of organic shit and
costco and mass produced widescale for

3193
02:23:07,681 --> 02:23:11,550
cheap because there's a demand for it.
you go there and Arizona and Nevada

3194
02:23:11,610 --> 02:23:13,010
maybe not the same,
you know,

3195
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:14,520
like whole foods is going to have whole
foods,

3196
02:23:14,521 --> 02:23:19,140
but from,
from giant companies like that they're

3197
02:23:19,141 --> 02:23:22,500
listening and it's just a matter of
money that people are willing to spend

3198
02:23:22,501 --> 02:23:23,790
it and this is what they want.

3199
02:23:23,790 --> 02:23:24,900
They're going to supply it,
period.

3200
02:23:25,380 --> 02:23:28,200
Yeah.
But there's also those ag ag gag laws

3201
02:23:28,201 --> 02:23:31,560
that keep people from filming factory
farms where they,

3202
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:34,200
you know,
they pack these chickens and these

3203
02:23:34,201 --> 02:23:37,860
horrible living conditions and you can't
film it if you film it,

3204
02:23:37,861 --> 02:23:40,560
you can get in deep trouble.
Like they did a drone video,

3205
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:43,440
uh,
a pig farm and the pig farm and

3206
02:23:43,441 --> 02:23:46,620
carolina,
that Was a motherfucker nasty.

3207
02:23:46,621 --> 02:23:50,740
And they show that they were,
they had next to and they interview the

3208
02:23:50,790 --> 02:23:54,090
people that are living by their and they
just smell it constantly.

3209
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:55,270
Oh yes.
Funk,

3210
02:23:55,750 --> 02:23:57,870
death.
Just death and methane.

3211
02:23:58,200 --> 02:23:58,831
I mean the,
the,

3212
02:23:58,831 --> 02:24:02,910
that river of piss and shit that comes
out of the bottom of that place and

3213
02:24:03,270 --> 02:24:05,150
settles into that little lake that they
had.

3214
02:24:05,151 --> 02:24:07,860
And that's not normal piston shit that
is the worst,

3215
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:12,920
most diseased piss and shit.
That's I imagine just living there,

3216
02:24:13,670 --> 02:24:15,830
working there rather like someone who
works in there,

3217
02:24:15,860 --> 02:24:19,950
like that's the sadness you feel every
day in the smells that you take in

3218
02:24:19,951 --> 02:24:20,640
through your nose.

3219
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:23,160
Every day.
Peta was shown a video probably one of

3220
02:24:23,161 --> 02:24:27,150
the worst that I actually had the balls
to watch of a how folk was made in

3221
02:24:27,151 --> 02:24:30,030
France.
You seeing this just brutal like they

3222
02:24:30,310 --> 02:24:33,390
have people are working there and
they're tossing in the chicks.

3223
02:24:34,270 --> 02:24:38,400
That's their job to them in the meat
grinder of humans that actually have to

3224
02:24:38,401 --> 02:24:41,100
be a part of that process.
So the ones that they don't,

3225
02:24:41,170 --> 02:24:43,780
they don't want to like was it males or
something like that.

3226
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:46,350
They get rid of to the female one or the
other,

3227
02:24:46,610 --> 02:24:47,430
but it's.
Yeah,

3228
02:24:47,430 --> 02:24:49,530
the folk want.
We know what's interesting about fog

3229
02:24:49,540 --> 02:24:52,410
wise,
they actually gravitate towards that

3230
02:24:52,411 --> 02:24:54,000
feeder.
It's really strange.

3231
02:24:54,001 --> 02:24:55,800
I had a farmer explained it to me
before,

3232
02:24:55,801 --> 02:24:58,080
like they actually want to be fed like
that.

3233
02:24:58,100 --> 02:25:01,940
Go to that feeder and you can grab them
and stick it in their mouth and we.

3234
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:04,770
It looks awful when they force feed them
bum up.

3235
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:06,810
Yeah,
they forced feeding with and just pour

3236
02:25:06,811 --> 02:25:09,720
it down their throat,
but apparently it's not that bad for

3237
02:25:09,721 --> 02:25:13,000
them.
It's just perception is as far as like

3238
02:25:13,070 --> 02:25:16,560
were fattening them up for slaughter and
what if that was you and they put your

3239
02:25:16,561 --> 02:25:19,380
mouth around this metal pipe and it's
quality of life,

3240
02:25:19,450 --> 02:25:21,390
you know,
but seeing these guys go through the

3241
02:25:21,391 --> 02:25:25,300
meat grinder and some of them don't die.
The grinding up of the chicks,

3242
02:25:25,301 --> 02:25:28,510
they get ground up and some come out the
other side still alive.

3243
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:32,590
She fog though.
They do that with a lot of roosters.

3244
02:25:32,830 --> 02:25:35,380
That's just a fact.
They just grind them up.

3245
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:36,760
Yeah,
it's a fuck deal.

3246
02:25:36,850 --> 02:25:38,340
It's a deal.
You know,

3247
02:25:38,350 --> 02:25:41,860
I was on the highway once I pass this
truck and it was stuffed with chickens.

3248
02:25:41,861 --> 02:25:43,150
It was just madness.

3249
02:25:43,480 --> 02:25:45,250
I was looking at this truck,
it was like,

3250
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:47,530
you know,
there were some openings where the

3251
02:25:47,531 --> 02:25:50,870
chickens could breathe like some small
holes in the side of the truck and you

3252
02:25:50,890 --> 02:25:55,890
just realizing this is like a,
a thing that's packed with life as being

3253
02:25:56,111 --> 02:25:59,800
treated like a commodity,
like stacked rocks.

3254
02:26:00,100 --> 02:26:01,750
You know?
It's bizarre.

3255
02:26:02,050 --> 02:26:04,910
It's bizarre to see a truck just driving
doWn the road.

3256
02:26:04,911 --> 02:26:09,911
It's just stacked bottom to top with
living things that are just going to get

3257
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:15,030
either ground up or chopped up or you
know,

3258
02:26:15,460 --> 02:26:17,710
doesn't matter.
Going off to death.

3259
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:21,010
Well it's what happened when we made
these city things.

3260
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:23,350
This is also something that didn't exist
10,

3261
02:26:23,351 --> 02:26:27,280
20,000 years ago when they had any kind
of agriculture back then.

3262
02:26:27,281 --> 02:26:29,470
You grew some livestock,
he killed those animals.

3263
02:26:29,471 --> 02:26:32,380
You knew where they lived,
he knew what they ate or you knew the

3264
02:26:32,381 --> 02:26:34,930
guy who raised them and it was real
simple.

3265
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:37,480
And then somewhere along the line
someone said,

3266
02:26:37,481 --> 02:26:42,481
we need like a costco of farming.
We need to get a big place and stuff.

3267
02:26:42,671 --> 02:26:46,570
Everything in there and close it to the
general public so nobody could see and

3268
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:50,980
jab these fuckers with needles and fill
them up with antibiotics so they don't

3269
02:26:50,981 --> 02:26:53,230
get sick for all this crazy food we're
giving them.

3270
02:26:53,231 --> 02:26:56,110
And boy,
that changed from that.

3271
02:26:56,350 --> 02:27:00,070
People are much more aware now and
they're asking for free range food and

3272
02:27:00,071 --> 02:27:04,480
antibiotic free food and you know,
grass fed meats and things along those

3273
02:27:04,481 --> 02:27:07,300
lines,
but most people can't afford it.

3274
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:10,030
A lot of people can't afford it is a
difference between,

3275
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:13,090
I think I spent a shit ton of money on
that.

3276
02:27:13,091 --> 02:27:14,980
I really do it.
A lot of money goes there.

3277
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:18,670
I think knowing where to get your food
from,

3278
02:27:18,700 --> 02:27:20,290
like there's certain things you got to
go like,

3279
02:27:20,291 --> 02:27:20,891
okay,
hey,

3280
02:27:20,891 --> 02:27:22,240
I can't afford that.

3281
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:25,360
To this day.
I don't buy grass fed filet mignon,

3282
02:27:25,361 --> 02:27:28,540
it's $25 a pound,
but I can afford grass fed burger,

3283
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:30,190
right?
And free range chicken.

3284
02:27:30,191 --> 02:27:33,310
TheY sell free range chicken free range,
organic chicken at costco now,

3285
02:27:33,400 --> 02:27:36,370
so I can get it for three 99 a pound.
What does that mean though?

3286
02:27:36,730 --> 02:27:41,230
When they say free range organic or they
lie down a field they're allowed to go

3287
02:27:41,231 --> 02:27:43,210
around.
Now there's varying levels of that

3288
02:27:43,211 --> 02:27:44,470
obviously.
Um,

3289
02:27:44,650 --> 02:27:48,280
and it's certainly on a mass scale,
you're probably not going to be the same

3290
02:27:48,281 --> 02:27:51,130
as farmer john down the street who's
doing it all natural.

3291
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,130
Organic is still going to be organic
feed,

3292
02:27:54,830 --> 02:27:56,770
you know,
they can't do any antibiotics and they

3293
02:27:56,771 --> 02:27:59,980
can't feed them gmo food.
From what my understanding is.

3294
02:28:00,060 --> 02:28:03,220
Well what's interesting to me is that
we're having these conversations now

3295
02:28:03,221 --> 02:28:05,830
very frequently.
There's a lot of these documentaries

3296
02:28:05,831 --> 02:28:08,770
where it's food inc or king corn or
cowspiracy.

3297
02:28:08,771 --> 02:28:11,680
There's a bunch of these documentaries
where people are examining how food is

3298
02:28:11,681 --> 02:28:15,000
made and prepared and where it's coming
from and how they're growing it and,

3299
02:28:15,490 --> 02:28:17,680
and we're more aware of it now than ever
before.

3300
02:28:17,681 --> 02:28:19,780
so some people,
at least some people,

3301
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:22,370
there's a movement to more conscious
choices

3302
02:28:22,610 --> 02:28:25,340
and this wasn't around when our parents
were around,

3303
02:28:25,550 --> 02:28:29,540
but I don't think factory farming was
around when they were around either.

3304
02:28:29,910 --> 02:28:31,970
Was also the difference in the amount of
people.

3305
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:37,160
I mean I've read something about the 19
seventies if there was like a hundred

3306
02:28:37,160 --> 02:28:40,190
million plus less people in America in
the 19 seventies.

3307
02:28:40,610 --> 02:28:43,670
I mean that's inside my life.
A $100,

3308
02:28:43,671 --> 02:28:47,150
million plus more people just here in
the United States.

3309
02:28:47,690 --> 02:28:49,400
Go research that.
Jamie,

3310
02:28:50,360 --> 02:28:55,360
pull that up is a wizard with this shit.
Nineteen 77.

3311
02:28:55,540 --> 02:28:58,070
He was around $203 million.
Yeah,

3312
02:28:58,250 --> 02:28:59,960
so It's $100.
Million difference.

3313
02:29:00,350 --> 02:29:02,740
That's crazy.
Boy,

3314
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:05,510
we've lucked the fuck.
We just love making babies.

3315
02:29:05,960 --> 02:29:07,550
Baby boomers.
All the baby boomers,

3316
02:29:07,551 --> 02:29:10,260
kids have kids and you're a part of the
problem now to allow me to.

3317
02:29:11,160 --> 02:29:13,230
Yeah,
the good news is the good.

3318
02:29:13,330 --> 02:29:14,750
The good news is we were like,
oh,

3319
02:29:14,751 --> 02:29:15,590
you know,
three,

3320
02:29:15,591 --> 02:29:16,460
four.
Who knows?

3321
02:29:16,670 --> 02:29:18,380
Right.
Then if you do that first six months and

3322
02:29:18,390 --> 02:29:20,000
you're like,
he might be an only child,

3323
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:24,560
what the fuck did we do?
What do we get ourselves into?

3324
02:29:25,020 --> 02:29:26,540
We were talking about this before the
podcast.

3325
02:29:26,580 --> 02:29:29,180
Once they start talking about it's a
totally different world,

3326
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:31,430
it gets it,
it all gets way better.

3327
02:29:31,460 --> 02:29:34,030
It gets way more easy,
but when they start talking,

3328
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:36,350
they become like your little friends,
you know,

3329
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:37,820
like it's,
it becomes like,

3330
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:40,370
I can't wait to see my kids.
Like after this podcast,

3331
02:29:40,371 --> 02:29:42,650
I'm gonna go hang out with them.
And it becomes amazing.

3332
02:29:42,980 --> 02:29:45,260
It is amazing.
And they hug you and they talked to you

3333
02:29:45,261 --> 02:29:47,510
about school.
And my daughter had this thing today at

3334
02:29:47,511 --> 02:29:48,470
school.
She had this little,

3335
02:29:48,690 --> 02:29:50,540
um,
you know,

3336
02:29:50,541 --> 02:29:52,460
like,
what do they call them?

3337
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:55,610
I want to say a recital assembly.
Thank you very much.

3338
02:29:55,611 --> 02:29:57,740
Jamie.
They had a little assembly and all the

3339
02:29:57,741 --> 02:30:01,250
kids do their little thing and she had
this big thing that she was really proud

3340
02:30:01,251 --> 02:30:04,820
of because she had announced something
and say a part of this little thing that

3341
02:30:04,821 --> 02:30:05,960
they were going to do part of the song.

3342
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:10,250
They're doing a song about a different
languages and speaking french speaking

3343
02:30:10,251 --> 02:30:13,340
spanish and so she,
she has to go up and do this little

3344
02:30:13,341 --> 02:30:15,170
thing.
It's just like this little proud moment

3345
02:30:15,500 --> 02:30:18,080
and afterwards she's like beaming and
she's so happy.

3346
02:30:18,081 --> 02:30:21,950
She's five and she runs up to me and
jumps in my arms and gives me this big

3347
02:30:21,951 --> 02:30:24,140
hug.
The love that you get from that,

3348
02:30:24,141 --> 02:30:27,830
the feeling that you get of,
of warmth and of love and connection

3349
02:30:27,831 --> 02:30:30,950
with this little tiny,
beautiful human boy is like nothing else

3350
02:30:30,951 --> 02:30:32,920
like it.
And then you also recognize,

3351
02:30:32,921 --> 02:30:35,240
and this was one of the big ones for me
as I,

3352
02:30:35,300 --> 02:30:40,280
as my chIldren got older and I started
putting it all started of trying at

3353
02:30:40,281 --> 02:30:42,260
least to put the pieces of it all
together.

3354
02:30:42,470 --> 02:30:45,950
I started looking at people like they're
babies.

3355
02:30:46,250 --> 02:30:46,671
Like,
oh,

3356
02:30:46,671 --> 02:30:51,320
this fucked up dude who's angry at the
world and just devastated.

3357
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:54,230
And just emotionally a wreck.
That was a baby.

3358
02:30:54,410 --> 02:30:59,410
That was a baby that just didn't get the
love that he needed or a baby that was

3359
02:30:59,481 --> 02:31:03,410
abused or a baby that was neglected or a
baby that was rejected,

3360
02:31:03,411 --> 02:31:06,590
like whatever.
It was a fucked up person.

3361
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:11,090
Now in my mind became a baby like crazy
people.

3362
02:31:11,091 --> 02:31:12,360
Like I'd see a girl,
you know,

3363
02:31:12,450 --> 02:31:17,450
on top of a bar with a fucking chop off,
ooh,

3364
02:31:17,690 --> 02:31:20,550
that's a baby.
That's a baby that became that.

3365
02:31:20,610 --> 02:31:22,820
Any asshole guy,
you know,

3366
02:31:22,821 --> 02:31:25,560
it was fucking screaming at people at
traffic and pointing up,

3367
02:31:25,561 --> 02:31:28,120
you'll fuck full.
You're fucking hills.

3368
02:31:28,500 --> 02:31:31,240
That's a baby.
That's a baby that became this asshole.

3369
02:31:31,241 --> 02:31:36,150
Like it's,
it's just this developmental process

3370
02:31:36,151 --> 02:31:39,300
that goes off the rails and into the
forest.

3371
02:31:39,301 --> 02:31:43,980
And it's fucked up.
And to get it back on track is insanely

3372
02:31:43,981 --> 02:31:45,420
difficult,
insanely.

3373
02:31:45,470 --> 02:31:49,950
And the work that's required,
most people are not willing to do dmt.

3374
02:31:50,220 --> 02:31:52,320
Most people are not willing to,
you know,

3375
02:31:52,321 --> 02:31:56,460
to change their diet and to take yoga
every morning and to fucking get up

3376
02:31:56,461 --> 02:32:00,120
early and meditate for 20 minutes every
day to try to be mindful.

3377
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:03,780
Most people are just acting on momentum.
Just scrambling.

3378
02:32:03,781 --> 02:32:08,140
And how can I distract myself?
What can I put in front of my face that

3379
02:32:08,141 --> 02:32:10,590
will make me think of something else
than what I have to deal with.

3380
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:14,760
That's whY I like talking to people like
you because I know that you're this on

3381
02:32:14,761 --> 02:32:18,750
this constant search for improvement and
this constant search for growth.

3382
02:32:18,751 --> 02:32:22,110
And I think that talking to people like
you and talking to people that are

3383
02:32:22,111 --> 02:32:26,910
filling themselves with knowledge and,
and constantly trying to evaluate their

3384
02:32:26,911 --> 02:32:29,100
perspective and maybe enhance their
perspective,

3385
02:32:29,610 --> 02:32:31,170
that's inspiring.
And um,

3386
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:31,840
it,
it,

3387
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:33,000
it,
it aLso,

3388
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:35,910
it gives fuel to other people that want
to do the same.

3389
02:32:36,330 --> 02:32:38,940
You know,
like people will hear this podcast and

3390
02:32:38,941 --> 02:32:40,080
they'll go,
fuck man,

3391
02:32:40,110 --> 02:32:42,810
I want to try some of that shit that
kyle kingsbury tried.

3392
02:32:43,050 --> 02:32:45,420
Maybe I want to do iowasca.
Maybe I want to read some of the books

3393
02:32:45,421 --> 02:32:47,040
that he read.
Maybe I want to try some of the

3394
02:32:47,041 --> 02:32:49,620
meditation techniques he's tried.
Maybe I want to do this,

3395
02:32:49,621 --> 02:32:52,530
maybe I want to do that.
And I think in doing that,

3396
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:57,270
like in like one person like you who's
seeking these things,

3397
02:32:57,420 --> 02:33:00,630
you can start like this cascade.
You start this,

3398
02:33:01,020 --> 02:33:05,030
this effect and you started the cascade.
I mean it have to fit.

3399
02:33:05,190 --> 02:33:07,380
I've listened to so many podcasts where
I was like,

3400
02:33:08,070 --> 02:33:09,780
fuck that guy.
Alright,

3401
02:33:10,260 --> 02:33:13,340
let me do that.
I mean even just wim hoff just in that

3402
02:33:13,340 --> 02:33:15,080
weeks I heard him,
I don't know,

3403
02:33:15,090 --> 02:33:18,080
maybe a couple of weeks after he was on,
I was doing breathwork at the beach and

3404
02:33:18,081 --> 02:33:18,960
my buddy was like,
man,

3405
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:20,610
he looked well.
We also had a little,

3406
02:33:20,611 --> 02:33:25,611
a laser disc will will say,
we watched the laser disc watched the

3407
02:33:26,650 --> 02:33:29,280
laserdisc.
How do I put this in?

3408
02:33:32,220 --> 02:33:34,470
Trying to figure out what to read
between the lines here.

3409
02:33:34,520 --> 02:33:39,350
I'm tribals syllables.
Laser ll.

3410
02:33:40,170 --> 02:33:41,480
There we go.
Okay.

3411
02:33:41,790 --> 02:33:43,710
You're talking about mushrooms and I was
like,

3412
02:33:43,711 --> 02:33:45,630
this is all this shit.
We've got to keep under wraps.

3413
02:33:46,020 --> 02:33:47,490
That's true.
Laser disk.

3414
02:33:47,491 --> 02:33:48,900
I get it.
I didn't understand that.

3415
02:33:49,230 --> 02:33:51,130
That's something I've never done.
See?

3416
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:53,400
Yeah.
Well

3417
02:33:55,830 --> 02:33:58,410
people keep telling me.
Some woman was yelling at me I to show

3418
02:33:58,411 --> 02:34:01,430
the other night.
I think

3419
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:08,160
I was listening to you and red band
talked about this and mescalin and

3420
02:34:08,161 --> 02:34:09,930
things like that and pod.
And I was like,

3421
02:34:09,931 --> 02:34:11,850
man,
I can't believe with having tried other

3422
02:34:11,851 --> 02:34:13,470
things that you didn't try that.
Yeah,

3423
02:34:13,471 --> 02:34:15,630
there's a bunch of shit I haven't tried.
I heard,

3424
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:18,250
um,
jim fadiman,

3425
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:19,630
who wrote the psychedelic explorer's
guide,

3426
02:34:19,640 --> 02:34:22,360
heard him on ferris's podcast.
God his book read it,

3427
02:34:22,540 --> 02:34:25,870
and then I saw that maps was doing the
multidisciplinary association of

3428
02:34:25,871 --> 02:34:29,680
psychedelic studies was doing a
presentation in palo alto down the

3429
02:34:29,681 --> 02:34:32,830
street from me and rick doblin,
the head of maps was going to be there

3430
02:34:32,831 --> 02:34:35,700
presenting with jim fadiman like,
oh,

3431
02:34:35,710 --> 02:34:36,850
this is amazing.
I got to go.

3432
02:34:37,480 --> 02:34:41,140
And once you've had a breakthrough
second delegate experience,

3433
02:34:41,320 --> 02:34:43,660
it's amazing.
It can be life changing or it can fuck

3434
02:34:43,661 --> 02:34:46,210
you up,
whatever you can take that for what it

3435
02:34:46,211 --> 02:34:48,550
is.
A large portion of his book was on

3436
02:34:48,551 --> 02:34:52,990
microdosing and in microdosing they were
talking about taking a sub,

3437
02:34:54,850 --> 02:34:57,820
sub perceptual breakthrough level.
So meaning like,

3438
02:34:57,880 --> 02:35:00,850
I don't see shit,
I just feel and think differently.

3439
02:35:01,510 --> 02:35:04,420
Right?
And he said that's really the future of

3440
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:07,360
psychedelic research.
And that's exactly what hoffman was

3441
02:35:07,361 --> 02:35:09,550
doing until he died at 100,
two years old.

3442
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:11,830
The guy who developed lsd.
Um,

3443
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:14,710
so we went and I listened to these guys
speak.

3444
02:35:14,711 --> 02:35:19,600
And since then I have tried microdosing
with lsd and it is phenomenal.

3445
02:35:19,660 --> 02:35:21,640
Like it's almost like a smart drug in
itself,

3446
02:35:21,670 --> 02:35:23,530
but you feel good,
you have energy,

3447
02:35:23,531 --> 02:35:27,160
you can see why people might do it at a
festival or a concert.

3448
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,670
Everything sounds a little more clear.
Like a music sounds better.

3449
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:33,340
If I could,
I could see myself running on it like a,

3450
02:35:33,341 --> 02:35:34,630
you really can,
can,

3451
02:35:34,750 --> 02:35:36,670
you could still interact.
I can talk to cops on it.

3452
02:35:36,671 --> 02:35:39,100
Like you were fine to communicate and to
be,

3453
02:35:39,101 --> 02:35:41,980
but you do think differently.
You are connected in a different way.

3454
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:45,040
That's all the rage in silicone valley.
Yeah,

3455
02:35:45,070 --> 02:35:45,641
yeah,
yeah,

3456
02:35:45,641 --> 02:35:47,710
exactly.
And I was talking to you right when I

3457
02:35:47,711 --> 02:35:49,660
was here and I was like,
oh man.

3458
02:35:49,690 --> 02:35:52,390
Oh man.
That down with a mescalin not down with

3459
02:35:52,391 --> 02:35:53,200
the lsd.

3460
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:54,490
Huh?
Not that I'm not down.

3461
02:35:54,700 --> 02:35:57,730
The problem with acid is the people that
want to do acid with you.

3462
02:35:57,731 --> 02:35:59,450
You don't want to do acid with them,
you know,

3463
02:35:59,460 --> 02:36:00,011
like,
yeah,

3464
02:36:00,011 --> 02:36:03,880
I gotta go dude.
It's all these weird people that are

3465
02:36:03,881 --> 02:36:06,460
pushing it and they want it.
Like dunkin is the only guy that I know

3466
02:36:06,461 --> 02:36:10,420
that gets real acid and we've sort of
made a loose commitment to me and him

3467
02:36:10,421 --> 02:36:12,790
getting together and doing it one day.
I want to hear about that,

3468
02:36:12,800 --> 02:36:13,633
that's for sure.
Awesome.

3469
02:36:13,660 --> 02:36:15,130
I'll definitely talk about it.
But,

3470
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:16,640
um,
the,

3471
02:36:16,740 --> 02:36:18,850
the,
the thing that I've been really into

3472
02:36:18,880 --> 02:36:23,880
that I get these big breakthrough,
I'm objective moments.

3473
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:29,230
Introspective moments is edible pot and
psych and um,

3474
02:36:29,590 --> 02:36:30,790
um,
flotation,

3475
02:36:30,791 --> 02:36:33,400
flotation chambers.
There's something about sensory

3476
02:36:33,401 --> 02:36:38,401
deprivation with the edible pot.
It creates this bizarre sort of,

3477
02:36:39,791 --> 02:36:42,640
um,
hallucinogenic state,

3478
02:36:42,730 --> 02:36:47,440
visionary state that's very unusual,
very unusual from a visionary

3479
02:36:47,441 --> 02:36:48,274
standpoint.

3480
02:36:48,430 --> 02:36:50,530
Do you,
when you see obviously you're in pitch

3481
02:36:50,531 --> 02:36:52,480
black,
so anything you see in your mind's eyes

3482
02:36:52,481 --> 02:36:55,780
What you're seeing,
would you say you see like more of the

3483
02:36:55,810 --> 02:36:59,560
sacred geometry or the kaleidoscope of
shapes and things that you do from dmt

3484
02:36:59,561 --> 02:37:04,561
or do you just see like a memory or you
relive something or maybe you see

3485
02:37:04,691 --> 02:37:08,890
something from that's been on your mind
and you live that moment for a second

3486
02:37:08,891 --> 02:37:10,600
and then pull back out of it?
well,

3487
02:37:10,601 --> 02:37:14,020
that's one of the fascinating things
about it is the experience is incredibly

3488
02:37:14,021 --> 02:37:16,280
flexible.
Whereas like the experience

3489
02:37:16,280 --> 02:37:18,680
of dmt,
although it varies,

3490
02:37:18,740 --> 02:37:22,420
it's also very dmt.
Like when you do dmt,

3491
02:37:22,430 --> 02:37:23,263
like,

3492
02:37:23,340 --> 02:37:26,310
aw,

3493
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:29,980
reality dissolves and you're there.
Like the last one that I had was very

3494
02:37:29,981 --> 02:37:32,230
strangely,
there was these gestures that were

3495
02:37:32,231 --> 02:37:34,420
giving me the finger.
They kept giving me the finger.

3496
02:37:34,421 --> 02:37:35,650
I'm like,
what is this about?

3497
02:37:35,890 --> 02:37:38,590
And then I was trying to figure out like
what are they trying to tell me?

3498
02:37:38,650 --> 02:37:40,800
And one of the things that were trying
to tell me is,

3499
02:37:40,801 --> 02:37:41,634
uh,
it,

3500
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:46,760
it was almost like a reaction to not
worrying what other people think of you

3501
02:37:50,201 --> 02:37:53,580
or not worrying about people fucking
with you or not.

3502
02:37:53,770 --> 02:37:55,540
It was almost like,
what do you care?

3503
02:37:55,630 --> 02:37:57,000
What do you care?
I'm doing this to youtube,

3504
02:37:57,010 --> 02:37:58,360
what do you care?
What do you care?

3505
02:37:58,570 --> 02:37:59,020
Like,
why,

3506
02:37:59,020 --> 02:38:03,070
why are you tripping about this?
And then I kind of got it in the trip

3507
02:38:03,071 --> 02:38:04,660
and then they'll like shaking their
head.

3508
02:38:04,690 --> 02:38:08,500
Yeah.
And there's this weird fractal thing

3509
02:38:08,501 --> 02:38:11,830
that's constantly going on,
but every time I do it,

3510
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:17,160
it seems like these lessons that are
wrapped up in these visions with

3511
02:38:18,340 --> 02:38:20,860
communicating entities,
whatever the fuck they are,

3512
02:38:20,861 --> 02:38:22,450
where they're figments of your
imagination,

3513
02:38:22,451 --> 02:38:24,640
whether they're real,
there's always lessons in there.

3514
02:38:24,970 --> 02:38:29,890
And these lessons are always pertaining
to either a personal hiccup that I got

3515
02:38:29,891 --> 02:38:34,600
going on or something that I'm
struggling with or trying to overcome or

3516
02:38:34,720 --> 02:38:38,140
something that I'm constantly focusing
on and trying to understand better.

3517
02:38:38,260 --> 02:38:39,760
So it's like,
let me help you out there,

3518
02:38:39,761 --> 02:38:41,620
dude,
fuck you.

3519
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:43,330
And you're like,
these gestures,

3520
02:38:43,331 --> 02:38:44,240
we're all going,
fuck you.

3521
02:38:44,241 --> 02:38:45,460
It was like,
why are they going to fuck you?

3522
02:38:45,710 --> 02:38:48,390
I was trying to figure out what it is.
It's like it's almost a,

3523
02:38:48,630 --> 02:38:52,000
an,
an inoculation to hostility.

3524
02:38:52,390 --> 02:38:55,420
Like their like letting you like what?
Why are you even taking this in?

3525
02:38:55,750 --> 02:38:56,590
Like you know,
what,

3526
02:38:56,591 --> 02:38:58,690
what,
why are you even concentrating on that?

3527
02:38:58,900 --> 02:39:00,880
This is pointless.
There's so much more.

3528
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:06,000
And then when you get past that level,
the experience in blossoms into some new

3529
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:10,030
level of experience.
So the dmt state is very dmt like.

3530
02:39:10,960 --> 02:39:14,770
But the cannabis,
the edible cannabis to the 11 hydroxy

3531
02:39:14,771 --> 02:39:17,200
metabolite state that you get from
edible cannabis,

3532
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:21,310
which is dose per dose,
five times more psychoactive than thc.

3533
02:39:21,310 --> 02:39:23,650
That's why people when they eat it,
they trip out and like,

3534
02:39:23,660 --> 02:39:26,800
oh my god,
so many laced it with something.

3535
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:29,560
No,
it's very much like an intense

3536
02:39:29,561 --> 02:39:33,400
psychedelic when you eat it.
That's why you got to be careful and not

3537
02:39:33,401 --> 02:39:35,650
eat too much.
Like people that fucking freak out and

3538
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:38,710
panic attacks.
It's because it's strong as shit when

3539
02:39:38,711 --> 02:39:40,720
you eat it.
But in the tank,

3540
02:39:41,230 --> 02:39:44,910
sometimes I go on these Journeys that I
like,

3541
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:49,690
I'm in the forest and I can hear other
languages and I understand them and I

3542
02:39:49,691 --> 02:39:54,691
don't know what the fuck they are and
sometimes I'm a part of a like a ball of

3543
02:39:54,791 --> 02:39:59,791
yarn that the universe is made out of
and each individual fiber that's in this

3544
02:40:00,761 --> 02:40:05,761
gigantic strand that's a part of this
wrapped up ball of yarn is all the

3545
02:40:06,430 --> 02:40:11,430
individual atoms that make up being a
person or a tree or a book or a rock and

3546
02:40:13,411 --> 02:40:18,000
all these different things are
intertwined and it shows you the fractal

3547
02:40:18,001 --> 02:40:23,001
nature of reality from the lowest
subatomic particle to the biggest planet

3548
02:40:23,671 --> 02:40:26,970
in the solar system to the biggest
galaxy in the universe.

3549
02:40:26,970 --> 02:40:31,970
And it just goes out there and this very
strange and humbling and bizarre like a

3550
02:40:32,641 --> 02:40:36,150
volt vulnerable vulnerability inducing
state.

3551
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:41,190
And then it'll go from that to cartoons.
Fucking like would to been like neon

3552
02:40:41,191 --> 02:40:44,460
cartoons banging each other and
producing a bunch of other neon

3553
02:40:44,560 --> 02:40:45,750
cartoons.
Cartoons.

3554
02:40:45,751 --> 02:40:48,060
Fucking dude.
This is not just cartoons fucking,

3555
02:40:48,061 --> 02:40:51,300
but they're like neon.
They're like made out of like neon

3556
02:40:51,301 --> 02:40:53,760
lights.
And they're banging each other and

3557
02:40:53,761 --> 02:40:56,490
they're,
they're becoming other ones that having

3558
02:40:56,491 --> 02:41:00,360
that god damn thing in my basement is a
blessing and a curse at the same time

3559
02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:01,800
because,
uh,

3560
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:03,990
it's,
it's a blessing and that it's great that

3561
02:41:03,991 --> 02:41:08,530
I can go in there anytime I want,
but sometimes one crazy trip,

3562
02:41:08,531 --> 02:41:11,730
I'll just leave me like baffled for
days,

3563
02:41:13,860 --> 02:41:17,580
but the relaxation aspect of it too.
So sometImes I'll go in there on the

3564
02:41:17,850 --> 02:41:21,300
couch and just chill out and just float
and I get out of there.

3565
02:41:21,300 --> 02:41:23,640
Man.
I feel like I'll be in there and while

3566
02:41:23,641 --> 02:41:26,250
I'm in there floating,
I like push down to my hips and my back

3567
02:41:26,251 --> 02:41:27,480
would go pop,
pop.

3568
02:41:27,810 --> 02:41:30,870
Like everything's like loosening up
because of all the,

3569
02:41:31,350 --> 02:41:35,490
all the epsom salts in it has magnesium
and magnesium is great for your body.

3570
02:41:35,491 --> 02:41:38,610
It's one of the best ways to absorb
magnesium is through the skin.

3571
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:43,860
That's why an epsom salt bath is so good
for your musCles and there's no epsom

3572
02:41:43,861 --> 02:41:47,790
salt bath can fuck with the tank.
Not even close that thousand pounds of

3573
02:41:47,791 --> 02:41:49,950
salt.
No massage can fuck with the tech.

3574
02:41:49,980 --> 02:41:50,730
Yeah,
go ahead.

3575
02:41:50,730 --> 02:41:53,040
Amazing massages.
But when you come of the tank,

3576
02:41:53,041 --> 02:41:56,760
you do feel like you're floating four
hours after you just feel high.

3577
02:41:57,060 --> 02:41:59,280
So you've been in the tank,
you just haven't been in a tank on

3578
02:41:59,281 --> 02:41:59,580
anything.

3579
02:41:59,580 --> 02:42:01,950
I haven't done anything in the tank.
Not yet.

3580
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:05,820
And that's like a smoke a little.
Just a little sister.

3581
02:42:05,830 --> 02:42:08,610
My brother,
my brother have a good now there's

3582
02:42:08,611 --> 02:42:10,620
plaCes available in the bay area.
See,

3583
02:42:10,650 --> 02:42:13,590
back in the day there was a lady in los
gatos so it wasn't far from me and she

3584
02:42:13,591 --> 02:42:17,070
sponsored me for fight camps,
so I would go in once a week or twice a

3585
02:42:17,071 --> 02:42:19,400
week leading up to a fight.
Oh really?

3586
02:42:19,410 --> 02:42:20,490
Interesting.
And it was amazing.

3587
02:42:20,550 --> 02:42:23,790
It was a great.
That really got me into flotation and

3588
02:42:23,791 --> 02:42:26,910
then she ended up moving down to santa
cruz,

3589
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:30,630
which is a little hike for me.
So I have been an oakland different

3590
02:42:30,631 --> 02:42:33,600
places.
They have them set up now and um,

3591
02:42:34,140 --> 02:42:36,840
there's a couple places that allow the
bin night run,

3592
02:42:36,870 --> 02:42:39,210
so you can go in at midnight and stay
overnight.

3593
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:43,020
So you do it overnight,
float all the way until 6:00 AM or 8:00

3594
02:42:43,020 --> 02:42:43,380
AM.

3595
02:42:43,380 --> 02:42:44,970
Yeah.
Someone's in there with you.

3596
02:42:45,270 --> 02:42:46,710
Oh,
they have someone working there,

3597
02:42:46,740 --> 02:42:47,460
but you're,
you know,

3598
02:42:47,460 --> 02:42:50,400
you can go in there and ben just
sleeping it basically so crazy.

3599
02:42:50,401 --> 02:42:52,260
Hippy.
They think they know what's up.

3600
02:42:52,261 --> 02:42:53,900
I think they know what time it is.
Oh,

3601
02:42:53,910 --> 02:42:57,840
so it's just a matter of what um,
you know,

3602
02:42:57,870 --> 02:42:59,130
what do I.
That's why I was like,

3603
02:42:59,131 --> 02:43:00,450
I was curious.
I wanted to ask you about that.

3604
02:43:00,451 --> 02:43:01,980
Like what do you,
what,

3605
02:43:02,130 --> 02:43:03,720
when you say visionary state,
what are you getting from that?

3606
02:43:03,721 --> 02:43:04,580
Well,
when you say like,

3607
02:43:04,740 --> 02:43:06,090
sometimes I'm in the woods.
There's this,

3608
02:43:06,650 --> 02:43:09,180
that's all the answer that I need.
That's for sure going to happen.

3609
02:43:09,270 --> 02:43:13,150
I've done mushrooms in them.
That's pretty intense to how many grams

3610
02:43:13,660 --> 02:43:14,351
now?
That many.

3611
02:43:14,351 --> 02:43:16,060
Like three.
Okay.

3612
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:17,370
See,
I found like,

3613
02:43:17,530 --> 02:43:19,780
I mean that's a lot,
but not like.

3614
02:43:19,960 --> 02:43:20,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

3615
02:43:21,100 --> 02:43:23,380
I feel like between a,
a,

3616
02:43:23,381 --> 02:43:28,381
one gram to four gram dose,
I get a lot of feeling from it,

3617
02:43:30,040 --> 02:43:33,190
but I don't necessarily get to a
visionary state of five grams,

3618
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:35,470
but do it in silent darkness.
Like where do you,

3619
02:43:35,471 --> 02:43:36,304
where are you doing it?

3620
02:43:38,370 --> 02:43:38,860
I,
yeah,

3621
02:43:38,860 --> 02:43:41,560
if I guess it would be,
it would be different there.

3622
02:43:41,650 --> 02:43:45,340
The visionary state,
to me it occurs with the eyes closed.

3623
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:48,160
That's where the real visions Come and
most of the time when people are doing

3624
02:43:48,161 --> 02:43:50,110
it,
they're out in nature and they were like

3625
02:43:50,140 --> 02:43:53,530
the first time I ever did mushrooms we
did it like in the woods and his

3626
02:43:53,531 --> 02:43:58,090
beautiful manage felt he felt like the
vibrations of the earth as if it was

3627
02:43:58,091 --> 02:44:02,950
like loving you and breathing and like,
like it was you felt like connected to

3628
02:44:02,951 --> 02:44:05,470
it in a way that I'd never felt before,
but there was no,

3629
02:44:05,560 --> 02:44:08,380
not much visions because you're out
there.

3630
02:44:08,381 --> 02:44:11,560
I mean it seemed like alive and
everything seemed strange,

3631
02:44:11,790 --> 02:44:14,950
kind of pixelated and everything sort of
had like a,

3632
02:44:14,951 --> 02:44:19,180
like a geometric pattern to it in a
weird way that you never experienced.

3633
02:44:19,240 --> 02:44:23,680
Tasha and I did have had him at the
beach and we had a monster dose one time

3634
02:44:23,681 --> 02:44:28,681
after iowasca is really kind of improved
other psychedelic experiences for both

3635
02:44:29,771 --> 02:44:31,090
of us because we can let go.

3636
02:44:31,270 --> 02:44:33,280
Yeah.
Like some of those lessons of not trying

3637
02:44:33,281 --> 02:44:34,210
to control it,
you know,

3638
02:44:34,211 --> 02:44:36,580
just going with the flow and,
and um,

3639
02:44:37,470 --> 02:44:41,050
and then also from a stomach standpoint,
like a lot of people that eat mushrooms,

3640
02:44:41,480 --> 02:44:43,750
it fucks her stomach up.
It used to fuck my stomach up,

3641
02:44:43,751 --> 02:44:47,560
but after you've purchased from iowasca,
like it's nothing for me to have a bunch

3642
02:44:47,561 --> 02:44:49,720
of mushrooms and my stomach's never did
that to me,

3643
02:44:49,810 --> 02:44:52,300
to my stomach.
I don't know why this is really is.

3644
02:44:52,301 --> 02:44:53,920
It's,
I think it's very personal deal.

3645
02:44:54,220 --> 02:44:57,310
But uh,
we had seven grams each on the beach and

3646
02:44:57,311 --> 02:45:01,270
that's the most we've ever taken.
And I went when I was face up,

3647
02:45:01,930 --> 02:45:04,600
she's 110 pounds too.
So she's the real trooper.

3648
02:45:04,601 --> 02:45:08,320
But when I was face up you could see
things that I wouldn't normally see

3649
02:45:08,321 --> 02:45:08,831
like,
like,

3650
02:45:08,831 --> 02:45:11,350
uh,
seagulls in a v formation I could see

3651
02:45:11,530 --> 02:45:13,540
like laser beams connecting their wings.

3652
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:17,470
And then it was like fractal,
like you would from a dmt trip.

3653
02:45:17,800 --> 02:45:21,340
but every color of the light spectrum
was connecting their wings as they

3654
02:45:21,341 --> 02:45:25,420
flowed through air.
And then the sound of the ocean is

3655
02:45:25,421 --> 02:45:28,050
different.
But then when I went face down and bears

3656
02:45:28,090 --> 02:45:31,650
buried my face in the sand,
then I had complete visionary state just

3657
02:45:31,651 --> 02:45:34,780
like dmt or or iowasca even.
Yeah,

3658
02:45:34,781 --> 02:45:37,630
I would imagine.
And probably last a long ass time to

3659
02:45:37,670 --> 02:45:41,680
long time.
That was a long day at the beach.

3660
02:45:43,420 --> 02:45:46,180
It's probably a couple solid hours of
visions then,

3661
02:45:46,181 --> 02:45:47,350
right?
With that kind of dose.

3662
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:48,520
Yeah.
On and off.

3663
02:45:48,730 --> 02:45:49,980
There were some.
Yeah,

3664
02:45:50,530 --> 02:45:52,180
there.
I kept seeing that initially I kept

3665
02:45:52,181 --> 02:45:55,990
seeing like this,
like a group of people like kind of

3666
02:45:55,991 --> 02:45:59,170
eyeball on us that I was thinking like,
are they going to take our shit?

3667
02:45:59,410 --> 02:46:01,750
Like are they going to try to steal or
am I going to have to fight someone?

3668
02:46:01,750 --> 02:46:04,360
Like this is weird.
This is a place not a lot of people go

3669
02:46:04,361 --> 02:46:06,790
to.
And I kept seeing that and then I had to

3670
02:46:06,791 --> 02:46:11,000
take a deep breath
and tosca You like feel me,

3671
02:46:11,001 --> 02:46:12,420
you know,
feel like my energy.

3672
02:46:12,421 --> 02:46:13,520
She could feel what's going on.
She's like,

3673
02:46:13,521 --> 02:46:17,450
are you okay?
Like somebody kind of come know whAt do

3674
02:46:17,460 --> 02:46:18,410
you,
what are you talking about?

3675
02:46:18,460 --> 02:46:20,600
She's like playing fucking sea turtle
bugs.

3676
02:46:20,660 --> 02:46:21,081
Shit.
Whatever,

3677
02:46:21,081 --> 02:46:22,940
you know,
like she just doesn't have it,

3678
02:46:22,941 --> 02:46:25,380
you know,
and she's looking over at me and am I

3679
02:46:25,381 --> 02:46:26,240
okay?
And she's like,

3680
02:46:26,480 --> 02:46:27,500
seriously,
you're fine,

3681
02:46:27,570 --> 02:46:28,760
don't worry,
you're fine.

3682
02:46:28,790 --> 02:46:29,623
I was like,
okay.

3683
02:46:29,950 --> 02:46:32,190
And I put my head back down and it kept
seeing.

3684
02:46:32,191 --> 02:46:34,520
Didn't like this young kid kind of comes
through the crowd,

3685
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,310
like he's going to challenge me and he
walks down like,

3686
02:46:38,210 --> 02:46:39,410
oh fuck,
I got a defender.

3687
02:46:39,430 --> 02:46:41,210
So I got to fight and I know how fucked
up I am.

3688
02:46:41,210 --> 02:46:42,560
Like I can't believe we had to defend
myself.

3689
02:46:42,590 --> 02:46:45,980
And I'm like,
it's playing out in my mind all the ways

3690
02:46:45,981 --> 02:46:47,360
that I'm going to have to fight this
guy.

3691
02:46:47,750 --> 02:46:49,990
And I realized right then like I stand
up open.

3692
02:46:49,991 --> 02:46:50,751
I was like,
oh fuck,

3693
02:46:50,751 --> 02:46:51,950
it's just a vision.
And I was like,

3694
02:46:52,920 --> 02:46:54,020
my heart's raciNg.
And I'm like,

3695
02:46:54,021 --> 02:46:57,560
why would I think that?
And then I realized every fucking day of

3696
02:46:57,561 --> 02:47:00,890
my life since I was a little kid,
I played that out.

3697
02:47:01,970 --> 02:47:06,710
Anytime someone gives me a dirty look or
it says like we're from whatever being

3698
02:47:06,711 --> 02:47:08,390
picked on as a kid,
bullied that kind of shit.

3699
02:47:08,420 --> 02:47:11,120
Like I always play that out,
like how am I going to have to fight

3700
02:47:11,121 --> 02:47:13,520
this guy?
Am I going to have to fucking defend

3701
02:47:13,521 --> 02:47:15,350
myself?
How's it going to play out?

3702
02:47:15,410 --> 02:47:18,170
Oh he's,
he's got a long fucking neck,

3703
02:47:18,171 --> 02:47:19,550
I'm going to take us back and choke them
out,

3704
02:47:20,090 --> 02:47:20,601
whatever,
you know,

3705
02:47:20,601 --> 02:47:20,870
what I'm saying?

3706
02:47:20,870 --> 02:47:23,140
But,
but it just showed me how silly this

3707
02:47:23,150 --> 02:47:27,140
dumb ass mind game that I would play and
I would go down the rabbit hole on a

3708
02:47:27,141 --> 02:47:28,930
fucking daily basis sometimes.
Like,

3709
02:47:28,970 --> 02:47:33,740
like just playing into this thought of
negativity that had no space for me and

3710
02:47:33,741 --> 02:47:35,330
it does me no good to play that out.
Like,

3711
02:47:36,170 --> 02:47:37,730
that's fine because then I'll do this.
No,

3712
02:47:37,731 --> 02:47:38,180
no,
no,

3713
02:47:38,180 --> 02:47:41,150
none of that shit.
I'm wasting time and becoming

3714
02:47:41,151 --> 02:47:44,150
emotionally attached to those thoughts.
It's not just,

3715
02:47:44,180 --> 02:47:45,530
oh,
I'm thinking about this.

3716
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:48,050
I'm feeling like I'm going to fight
right now.

3717
02:47:48,470 --> 02:47:51,440
That fucks you up.
That turns you into not your best

3718
02:47:51,441 --> 02:47:54,940
version of yourself.
So that vision from mushrooms was just a

3719
02:47:54,970 --> 02:47:58,610
fucking game changer.
It doesn't stop me from having those

3720
02:47:58,611 --> 02:48:01,550
thoughts,
but it allows me to catch myself.

3721
02:48:01,580 --> 02:48:04,100
I'm aware of it.
You know the pattern still exists,

3722
02:48:04,101 --> 02:48:05,100
you just don't entertain it.

3723
02:48:05,250 --> 02:48:07,280
I don't entertain it.
I can see it and let it go.

3724
02:48:07,281 --> 02:48:08,450
Like when they talk about meditating,
oh,

3725
02:48:08,470 --> 02:48:10,550
if you have a thought,
just recognize the thought and let it

3726
02:48:10,551 --> 02:48:12,170
go.
That's easier said than done.

3727
02:48:12,200 --> 02:48:17,090
Now I've had time to digest and
assimilate that and especially bouncing

3728
02:48:17,091 --> 02:48:19,100
or bartender and the guy's being a dick
or whatever.

3729
02:48:19,250 --> 02:48:21,170
It's very easy,
much easier for me to be like,

3730
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:23,270
I don't have to entertain.
The guy swings at me.

3731
02:48:23,271 --> 02:48:25,850
Then it happens.
That's worried about you're not going to

3732
02:48:25,851 --> 02:48:29,460
not know when it's getting there,
but there's no need sometimes.

3733
02:48:29,470 --> 02:48:31,700
The things.
I always say that about cops,

3734
02:48:31,910 --> 02:48:36,650
like sometimes I bet certain people,
whether it's the people that deal with

3735
02:48:36,651 --> 02:48:38,690
the cops or certain people that are
cops,

3736
02:48:39,080 --> 02:48:44,080
things happen that don't need to happen
because people have these ideas or have

3737
02:48:44,391 --> 02:48:47,990
these patterns that are playing on in
their head and for a comp I would

3738
02:48:47,991 --> 02:48:50,960
imagine it's got to be incredibly
difficult because you're dealing with

3739
02:48:50,961 --> 02:48:55,180
all these people that are constantly
breaking laws and violating things and

3740
02:48:55,181 --> 02:48:57,770
you're supposed to enforce them and
you're constantly worried about getting

3741
02:48:57,771 --> 02:49:00,710
shot and getting home to your family.
You're constantly worried about pulling

3742
02:49:00,711 --> 02:49:03,230
some guy over and he's got fucking 20
pounds of coke in the back of the

3743
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:06,020
machine gun in his front seat and you
don't know because there's windows are

3744
02:49:06,021 --> 02:49:08,130
tinted elixir.
Roll down your window

3745
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:09,330
and you get your hand on your gun.
You're like,

3746
02:49:09,331 --> 02:49:12,900
what the fuck am I getting into here?
And then these patterns that people

3747
02:49:12,901 --> 02:49:15,210
have,
whether it's as a police officer,

3748
02:49:15,211 --> 02:49:19,590
as a person getting pulled over by cops,
they can change the way you interact

3749
02:49:19,591 --> 02:49:24,210
with people and change the circumstances
of the day and and turned a tragedy into

3750
02:49:24,211 --> 02:49:27,570
a nothing or nothing into a tragedy.
That's the lens.

3751
02:49:27,571 --> 02:49:31,230
That's the filter you see through all
your interactions come out of that

3752
02:49:31,500 --> 02:49:32,460
patterns,
man.

3753
02:49:33,150 --> 02:49:36,810
And sometimes the beautiful thing about
psychedelics is that it allows you to

3754
02:49:36,811 --> 02:49:40,110
get outside of you and look at the
ridiculousness of you.

3755
02:49:41,040 --> 02:49:42,470
that's one of the biggest.
yeah,

3756
02:49:42,570 --> 02:49:45,030
that's it.
You're talking about change and

3757
02:49:45,031 --> 02:49:50,010
transformation and things like that.
That's been my biggest catalyst and

3758
02:49:50,011 --> 02:49:52,450
seeing the way I behave and that doesn't
mean that I'm mr.

3759
02:49:52,530 --> 02:49:54,300
Perfect.
And then I don't get angry or I'm not a

3760
02:49:54,520 --> 02:49:55,430
like,
yeah,

3761
02:49:56,400 --> 02:49:58,530
no sleep for six months with a child.

3762
02:49:58,680 --> 02:49:59,970
We've,
we've touched it.

3763
02:49:59,980 --> 02:50:01,140
I've had though.
That's the.

3764
02:50:01,230 --> 02:50:02,540
Anybody who's had a kid.
No.

3765
02:50:02,541 --> 02:50:04,380
It's like that's fucking a real
struggle.

3766
02:50:04,740 --> 02:50:06,480
There's no perfect people,
man.

3767
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:09,960
This doesn't exist.
That's this idea that there's a perfect

3768
02:50:09,961 --> 02:50:11,820
person.
This is an enlightened being.

3769
02:50:12,240 --> 02:50:17,240
There are people that choose to go down
certain paths that will lead to them

3770
02:50:18,421 --> 02:50:22,110
making better decisions,
lead to them living a more harmonious

3771
02:50:22,111 --> 02:50:24,270
life,
but you're just a monkey.

3772
02:50:24,870 --> 02:50:28,860
You just some fucking talking ape that's
on this planet filled with

3773
02:50:28,861 --> 02:50:32,820
contradictions and chaos and you're
trying to get through like all of us are

3774
02:50:33,090 --> 02:50:36,870
and who's going to be interrelationship
drama in work,

3775
02:50:36,871 --> 02:50:40,470
drama on and fucking community drama,
neighborhood drama,

3776
02:50:40,740 --> 02:50:43,890
and you're gonna.
Sometimes you'll be too stressed out or

3777
02:50:43,891 --> 02:50:48,080
too tired or too distracted or two too
overworked or whatever the fuck it is.

3778
02:50:48,081 --> 02:50:49,590
You're going to have a bad reaction to
those things.

3779
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:52,710
It doesn't define you.
That's a real problem that people have

3780
02:50:52,711 --> 02:50:54,570
though,
is one bad reaction.

3781
02:50:54,571 --> 02:50:56,070
Like you yell at your neighbor and your
neighbor,

3782
02:50:56,080 --> 02:50:58,020
fuck you and the cops come you piece of
shit.

3783
02:50:58,021 --> 02:51:00,490
I'm going to slash your tires and fuck
you and these things that have.

3784
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:03,150
I got a buddy of mine last night,
explained to me something that he got

3785
02:51:03,151 --> 02:51:07,620
into his with his neighbor and uh,
he accuses neighbor of slashing his tire

3786
02:51:07,950 --> 02:51:10,190
and he,
he fucking know,

3787
02:51:10,191 --> 02:51:11,100
like,
yelled at his neighbor.

3788
02:51:11,250 --> 02:51:14,790
And then he got his car picked up by
aaa,

3789
02:51:14,970 --> 02:51:15,890
they changed the tire.
they go,

3790
02:51:15,891 --> 02:51:16,890
no,
you hit a curb,

3791
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:22,890
curb and deflated his tire.
And he was blaming his neighbor,

3792
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:24,690
pull the spear out of your mouth right
now.

3793
02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:26,790
Created this whole fall.
And he was like.

3794
02:51:26,910 --> 02:51:28,200
And I was like,
he's a comic.

3795
02:51:28,201 --> 02:51:29,280
I was like,
are you going to talk about this on

3796
02:51:29,281 --> 02:51:29,550
stage?

3797
02:51:29,550 --> 02:51:30,331
He was like,
I can't.

3798
02:51:30,331 --> 02:51:33,120
I'm too embarrassed now.
I'm not ready to like,

3799
02:51:33,150 --> 02:51:34,210
this isn't funny to me.
Yeah.

3800
02:51:34,211 --> 02:51:35,670
He's like,
he's telling me because we're friends,

3801
02:51:35,910 --> 02:51:37,110
we're both laughing.
I'm like,

3802
02:51:37,111 --> 02:51:39,070
fuck man.
Did you apologize to emulate?

3803
02:51:39,440 --> 02:51:40,720
Not yet.
IT was like,

3804
02:51:40,740 --> 02:51:42,150
god damn it,
I don't know what to do.

3805
02:51:42,420 --> 02:51:45,270
Like because his neighbor would get
pissed because he parked in front of his

3806
02:51:45,330 --> 02:51:48,420
house and the guy had trash cans and
he's like,

3807
02:51:48,421 --> 02:51:50,920
you park it too close to my trash cans.
I can't get my trash cans.

3808
02:51:50,921 --> 02:51:52,020
And I was like,
what?

3809
02:51:52,320 --> 02:51:55,020
And so he goes out,
he finds this note on his car and his

3810
02:51:55,021 --> 02:51:57,600
tires flat.
And he assumed that the guy wrote the

3811
02:51:57,601 --> 02:52:00,560
note tire.
Yeah,

3812
02:52:01,560 --> 02:52:03,600
he's a good guy.
But he fucked up,

3813
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:05,320
you know,
like fuck ups,

3814
02:52:05,410 --> 02:52:07,930
but if you took those fuck ups and you
like,

3815
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:10,000
it's all,
you concentrate on your whole life all

3816
02:52:10,001 --> 02:52:10,960
the times you fucked up.

3817
02:52:11,050 --> 02:52:11,861
Like you're like,
oh my god,

3818
02:52:11,861 --> 02:52:13,480
I'm a fuck up.
Like no,

3819
02:52:13,481 --> 02:52:16,180
you just a person man did.
That shit will repeat itself.

3820
02:52:16,190 --> 02:52:20,740
Like you will fall into the path of that
instead of having the humility or at

3821
02:52:20,741 --> 02:52:24,700
least getting a little help from an
outside source that allows you to take a

3822
02:52:24,701 --> 02:52:26,920
step back,
pull the blinders off and see what's

3823
02:52:26,921 --> 02:52:28,150
going on and be like,
you know what man,

3824
02:52:28,240 --> 02:52:31,420
I fucked up.
That's also whY objectivity is so

3825
02:52:31,421 --> 02:52:35,890
important and introspective thought is
so important because sometimes people

3826
02:52:35,891 --> 02:52:38,200
just make excuses for everything they
do.

3827
02:52:38,410 --> 02:52:40,600
Everything they do,
they have a fucking excuse for.

3828
02:52:40,601 --> 02:52:43,210
So you never get the lessons and you
never get the growth.

3829
02:52:43,510 --> 02:52:45,100
He never learned.
You just,

3830
02:52:45,101 --> 02:52:48,550
you just constantly repeat,
constantly repeat.

3831
02:52:48,551 --> 02:52:53,270
And then one day you're a Bitter old man
yelling at these kids to stop what

3832
02:52:53,271 --> 02:52:56,920
they're fucking rock and roll music and
your goddamn car.

3833
02:52:56,920 --> 02:53:00,790
Driving down my street,
we got loud muffler and that's the same

3834
02:53:00,791 --> 02:53:03,140
shit.
He knows his patterns stayed.

3835
02:53:03,150 --> 02:53:04,960
They fall into these patterns and then
they die.

3836
02:53:05,260 --> 02:53:08,050
And these never,
never corrected enough.

3837
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:08,780
Never.
Never.

3838
02:53:08,780 --> 02:53:10,600
Just never got it.
Never got it right.

3839
02:53:10,780 --> 02:53:12,700
No introspection.
If there's no quiet time.

3840
02:53:12,940 --> 02:53:14,200
Yeah,
we're running out of time.

3841
02:53:14,320 --> 02:53:16,270
What's it sober called?
Kingsborough.

3842
02:53:16,271 --> 02:53:17,560
You bad motherfucker.
This is fun,

3843
02:53:17,561 --> 02:53:18,490
man.
Fuck yeah,

3844
02:53:18,491 --> 02:53:19,420
we did this.
I loved it.

3845
02:53:19,630 --> 02:53:23,500
so I gotta get one of those bad boys and
get my millimolAr millimeters.

3846
02:53:23,590 --> 02:53:25,510
What does it millimolar.
Chella mowers.

3847
02:53:25,511 --> 02:53:28,660
Checked and blood.
The blood ketone meter.

3848
02:53:29,230 --> 02:53:31,720
So let's do this again man.
I think we could probably do this for

3849
02:53:31,721 --> 02:53:34,750
fucking hours and hours and hours to
come back again.

3850
02:53:35,050 --> 02:53:38,020
One more time.
A king's bu on twitter.

3851
02:53:38,021 --> 02:53:42,190
If you want to get ahold of cow.
I put that on my twitter and uh,

3852
02:53:42,280 --> 02:53:43,270
that's it.
Thanks brother.

3853
02:53:43,300 --> 02:53:44,950
Appreciate it man.
Thank you very much brother.

3854
02:53:45,070 --> 02:53:47,080
Alright my friends,

3855
02:53:47,110 --> 02:53:48,850

3856
