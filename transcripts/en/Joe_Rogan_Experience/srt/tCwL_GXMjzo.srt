1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,180
The Joe Rogan experience,
a lot of people believe it's a

2
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:06,150
controlled demolition.
I don't think necessarily she is saying

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:08,910
that it is or it isn't and I certainly
am not.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,490
I don't know.
I don't understand that.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,930
You know what I believe more.
It was a controlled demolition.

6
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:14,460
Yes.
But with it by us.

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,530
Yes.
You know?

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,580
Yeah.
I mean I think that's always been the

9
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:18,870
case of the.
The argument,

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,520
they don't think it was done by the
terrorists.

11
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,170
They think see building the tear.
What?

12
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,450
No.
What if the terrorists.

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,870
Oh,
they did a controlled demolition.

14
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:30,420
Yeah.
It wasn't like if somehow they had.

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,970
Because terrace probably could easily.
I think that would probably be before

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,150
hijacking planes and flying them into
buildings before that would be putting a

17
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:40,520
bomb into building.
Yes,

18
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,200
but it's not that easy.
See,

19
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:47,010
like when will you see what happened in
Oklahoma City that was multiple bombs?

20
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,690
You know,
in Oklahoma City they actually,

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,580
there was all these reports of the FBI
removing bombs from the building like

22
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:56,520
that didn't explode.
And if you talk to these guys that are

23
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:58,260
demolition experts,
they say there's no way.

24
00:00:58,261 --> 00:01:00,990
That was a fertilizer bomb.
There's no fucking way.

25
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,960
They said that.
If you look at the amount of damage that

26
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:08,520
did and look at where the blast radius
is from the way it blows out,

27
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,390
it doesn't blow.
They're not designed to.

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,340
You're saying this building because
we've all seen the loose change where

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,900
you watch the lights go off around the
building one floor by one.

30
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:20,430
It's like,
yeah,

31
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:23,520
but see they don't see.
They don't know what that means though.

32
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:27,870
That also could be.
If the ceiling is coming in and slamming

33
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,750
into the floor,
all the windows would do that.

34
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,130
They don't know that that's explosions.
If it really was collapsing like that.

35
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,740
See no one's ever seen a building
collapsed like that.

36
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:40,740
So when they say that those are blips
and those are squibs,

37
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,460
I don't like that because then you're.
You're saying you know for sure what

38
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:46,590
that is and I'm saying the fuck you do.
I don't know.

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,890
Even though there's just because someone
has to know.

40
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:52,080
I'm not saying it was as.
I'm not saying it was an inside job.

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,760
It just seems odd ergonomically that you
would design a building that if impacted

42
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:59,400
at a certain point the entire thing
would demolish.

43
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:02,190
Like what structurally?
What purpose does that serve?

44
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:02,760
Well,
the.

45
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,990
Yeah,
the weird.

46
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,580
Well,
it could just be in competence.

47
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:07,230
That's possible.
If you look at humans,

48
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:08,730
that's our most likely option,
right?

49
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:11,880
I mean when did they make the world
trade center so fucking long ass time

50
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,820
ago to get so cocky to build a building
that's 100 God damn stories high.

51
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,560
And how long did they think that was
gonna stay up there for you know,

52
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,300
what if it started falling apart in a
rotting,

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,730
what it was,
it was just so just a wonky piece of

54
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:25,480
shit by the time I got hit by those
planes.

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,680
That's totally true.
I mean fucking thing was oldest shit.

56
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,720
That thing was around as black and white
television.

57
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,330
Jessica Lange,
King Kong.

58
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,350
I mean.
Yeah,

59
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,520
but what's retrofitting the cheapest
goddamn floor and the cheapest guy.

60
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,380
A bitter,
you know that to do that.

61
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,490
How many floors was treated with bombs
maybe?

62
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,240
Well,
that's the crazy idea.

63
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:47,430
What we're,
what we're saying about a building seven

64
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:49,530
or or the other building that terrorists
could have done it.

65
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,530
I mean I guess they could have,
but how the fuck are they going to get

66
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:54,180
in there and put all those explosives
in?

67
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:57,330
It's like dynamite up a time.
Those red sticks of dynamite.

68
00:02:57,331 --> 00:03:00,580
One tying up your ass.
You're working the fucking thing.

69
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,030
Five years everyday.
Fucking putting it into this closet.

70
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,770
So funny.
Back then they didn't have security

71
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,740
department sticks.
You're walking down the hallway and you

72
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:14,020
just smell shit.
Open this door.

73
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:17,950
What's in this smells like shit and it
says shitty dynamite sticks.

74
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,690
It's like a fucking log house built with
shit dynamite sticks and little hairs.

75
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,240
A Cat pee mattress.
