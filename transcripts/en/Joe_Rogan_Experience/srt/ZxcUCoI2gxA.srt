1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,150
A video game was pretty intense
to the new UFC game on ps a.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,120
And I know it sounds
like I'm plugging but it,

4
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:10,391
no,

5
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:10,990
it was cool.

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,450
We would yelling me and my
me and my friend like God,

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,330
like it was that intense cause it was,

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:16,661
you know,

9
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:19,960
there's parts where you almost about to
knock the guy out and then it's a good

10
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:20,350
game.

11
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,430
It's a very good game.

12
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,000
I have fun so I can
attest to it because uh,

13
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,390
I had to do the commentary for that game.

14
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:27,730
Yeah.

15
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,240
Like the,

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,800
when you hear that EA sports game,

17
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:31,570
that's not commentary from actual fights.

18
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:31,990
Right.

19
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,780
That's commentary.

20
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,170
Just me doing pretend and
Goldberg don't pretend.

21
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,790
And Dude,

22
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,670
we did a fuck load of hours.

23
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,710
I mean it was hours and hours and hours
and hours and it was a over a long,

24
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,551
and I'm not complaining,

25
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:49,490
I'm just saying you got to the
APP stuff and there's main man.

26
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,813
What scan?

27
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,320
Oh

28
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,630
Yay.

29
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,841
Yeah,

30
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:55,411
I'm in the game.

31
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:56,440
You have to um,

32
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,590
have a secret.

33
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,420
I got to have a code like the Konami Code.

34
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,283
Oh,

35
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,441
I did this.

36
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,530
So I can get out of doing more commentary

37
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,860
because there was so much to do.

38
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:08,130
Tim,

39
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,060
I wish I looked that good.

40
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,590
There was so much to do,

41
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,200
uh,

42
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,033
as though it was,

43
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,480
it was a constant grind,

44
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,370
but I put my app,

45
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,110
my full effort into it.

46
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:20,730
Like I really wanted it to be good.

47
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh,

48
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,910
I was thinking if I was a kid
and I was playing this game,

49
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,250
I would want it to sound like,

50
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,870
like a guy really got head killed.

51
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,743
It's,

52
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,370
it's intense man.

53
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,530
Like we are here.

54
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:30,811
It is,

55
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:30,990
man.

56
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,330
It,

57
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:31,560
it was,

58
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,280
it was a fun.

59
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,120
It was like,

60
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,800
I want to see me get beat the fuck up.

61
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,023
Just Jamie.

62
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,820
Jamie shown a video of me about
to get my ass kicked by Nick Diaz.

63
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,470
How you get destroyed
really fast with a mansion.

64
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,940
If the game's realistic,

65
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,893
pull it up.

66
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,290
Come on,

67
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:46,430
Hajj.

68
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,030
And I get fucked up
people who want to see it.

69
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,420
But they might have used to
show you a secret character.

70
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:52,021
They might have.

71
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,880
You got some bullshit skills.

72
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,050
Might have you juiced up.

73
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,041
I got,

74
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,191
it.

75
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:56,641
Doesn't matter.

76
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:57,980
I got some bullshit with pills.

77
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,010
Let's hear Mike,

78
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,421
cause you know what,

79
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:00,770
I'm super casual fans.

80
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:01,650
So my commentary,

81
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,380
no bra with the leg kick.

82
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:04,560
I've never heard this before.

83
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,453
Oh it wasn't?

84
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,020
Oh Broga.

85
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,960
Good with the leg kicks.

86
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,910
Row Rogan got kicked in the face.

87
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,803
Oh good.

88
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,830
With the kicks.

89
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,300
Diaz is backing it up.

90
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,290
Rogan missed.

91
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,330
Oh really?

92
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,210
Kicked in the chest.

93
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,380
Tattoos.

94
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,213
Accurate.

95
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,083
Look at that.

96
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,333
Holy Shit.

97
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,063
Oh,

98
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,780
oh.

99
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,970
Oh Rob isn't that can about
the high disadvantage.

100
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,040
Oh Oh oh.

101
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,150
[inaudible] is in danger.

102
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,320
Let's see what Rogan's
ground game is like.

103
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,563
Not Good.

104
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,270
Diaz is about the

105
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,740
dark shit off my back.

106
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,200
Will Rogen be able to pull off
a submission from this position.

107
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,160
Oh rogue is it?

108
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,313
Oh,

109
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,300
let them turn around.

110
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,870
It's called a sweep this amount.

111
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,793
Oh Man,

112
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,630
I let him up.

113
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,463
Wow.

114
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,363
Good kid.

115
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,130
Roll it back up.

116
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,160
Oh ooh.

117
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,140
This should be illegal.

118
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,120
Oh,

119
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,130
rolled it should be illegal back.

120
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,100
And two people fake fight when you know
one dude would beat the fuck out of me.

121
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,850
I said may so did not leave
any and he gives the illusion.

122
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,950
Oh this is so stupid

123
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,533
staff.

124
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,860
He's out.

125
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,140
Oh Shit.

126
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,160
Oh wait,

127
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,840
why are they let me punch him in
the head when he was unconscious?

128
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,850
Why don't they stop the fight quick and
that does fake me rather than the fake

129
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:37,684
ham.

130
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,321
How'd that feel?

131
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:38,690
Weird,

132
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,523
but felt weird.

133
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,320
You know what bothered me the most?

134
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,640
The last two punches?

135
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,863
Because it wasn't,

136
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,430
he was already unconscious.

137
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,600
The fake him.

138
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,680
Gotcha.

139
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,490
Oh,

140
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,740
did you know how hard Nick
Diaz would fuck me up?

141
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,920
Like this is an embarrassment to humanity.

142
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,890
This is allowed to be
a visual image of me.

143
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:58,370
Beaten Nick Diaz his ass.

144
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,580
I've dumped all the brown James before.

145
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,150
I do enjoy shit,

146
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:02,984
man.

147
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,450
That's what,

148
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:04,960
that's what?

149
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,321
That's what,

150
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,154
it's an escape.

151
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:15,690
Okay.
