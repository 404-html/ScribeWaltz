1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,180
Doom,
doom,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:02,731
dum,
dum,

3
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:03,840
dum,
three,

4
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,460
two,
one.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,390
Oh,
ladies and gentlemen,

6
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:12,270
we've got a sweet show today.
Cameron Hanes is in the building.

7
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:13,650
Ladies and gentlemen,
Cameron Hanes.

8
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,603
So what's up brother Scott?
Motherfucking eastwood is in the House 

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,043
and if you can't see me it's because I'm
wearing this sweet underarmour cammo 

10
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:23,130
shirt and I do tend to blend into the 
background.

11
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:25,110
So if you get confused and go where it 
was,

12
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,970
Joe's head just floating in the air like
that.

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,190
But if you,
if you could see it,

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,083
you'd be,
you'd noticed you look Jack Jack's 

15
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,950
right.
Is tight form formed into an appealing a

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,040
tail on it.
It's a floating head.

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,320
So a cams in town were shooting both 
today.

18
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:41,820
And I know he gave you a bowl yesterday.

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,730
Yeah,
yeah,

20
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,181
yeah.
He,

21
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:43,710
uh,
we,

22
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,543
we went down to riverside,
riverside our tree and to check out a 

23
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,050
show me throw me a blow by blow.
So that was

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,080
cool.
You had an old,

25
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,240
had an old bow.
We'd,

26
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,080
we had an upgrade.
Didn't way.

27
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,720
What was the old bell?
It was an old Ross.

28
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:03,410
It was Ross probably from like,
yeah,

29
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,480
same company.
No,

30
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,070
I didn't,
I didn't even hurt.

31
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:09,050
Is Ross in archery company a big archery
company?

32
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:10,400
No.
Small.

33
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,140
Yeah,
it's small.

34
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,973
I don't know.
I'm not even sure if they still don't 

35
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,560
make them anymore.
This was like a secondhand Bo.

36
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:16,394
I bought off somebody a years ago.
So is this something you wanted to do 

37
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:21,590
for awhile and somehow or another you've
got to hold the cam?

38
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,480
Uh,
I don't remember how we got connected.

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,110
Did we instagram?
He likes to say I slid them a dad.

40
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,610
Desperate girl.
I think.

41
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,503
I mean I always put up hunting stuff 
obviously and I think you commented 

42
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:39,044
maybe or something.
So it wasn't like an unsolicited dom 

43
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,560
like,
hey,

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,030
I'd like to get to know you a little 
better,

45
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,250
but I think it was a little bit okay 
too,

46
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:49,160
you know,
if you know,

47
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,860
it's all good.
I mean it's 2017.

48
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:56,630
Everybody's free to express themselves.
So if something like that built on.

49
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:57,464
And then we just started archery and are
talking to archery than hunting and you 

50
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:00,590
know,
he,

51
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,423
he grew up in hunt his hunted and had 
the bow and so he got done with this 

52
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:08,210
movie stuff and was here and thought,
hey,

53
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,680
let's get together.
Also

54
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,140
the public land stuff to uh,
you know,

55
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,040
been noticing you guys both been talking
about that.

56
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,730
And so I was really interested in that.
So I started reading up about it and,

57
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,260
and I just said,
you know,

58
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,340
hey,
how can I help?

59
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,980
How can I get involved because this 
means a lot to me.

60
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:25,760
I'm a native Californian and I grew up 
going to yosemite,

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,460
you know,
going hunting and fishing,

62
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,200
uh,
using the public lands.

63
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,510
And so it was really important to me.
You know,

64
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,120
my dad was a state parks commissioner.
Uh,

65
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,310
most people don't know that.
So when was this?

66
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,083
This was,
this was gonna be before he was the 

67
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:41,601
mayor?
No,

68
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:42,150
no,
no,

69
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,471
no,
no.

70
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:43,304
After this.
Really?

71
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,390
Yeah.
This was after.

72
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,010
So fairly recently then?
Yeah,

73
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,810
probably in the last,
I would say 15 years.

74
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,930
I know he,
he,

75
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,200
he,
he did it for awhile and then got out.

76
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,910
Um,
but you know,

77
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:54,560
he was,
he was big and um,

78
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,420
in the,
uh,

79
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,690
do you remember the toll road going 
through the

80
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,550
San Clemente?
No,

81
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,470
I'm not aware of that.
Yes.

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:02,990
So they,
they,

83
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,620
they were proposing a,
this was an arnold Schwarzenegger was a,

84
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,543
was an office and they were proposing a 
toll road to go through San Clemente 

85
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:13,650
which goes through a trestles,
which is a popular surf break and uh,

86
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,071
he was,
you know,

87
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:15,880
everyone,
you know,

88
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,340
got behind it,
um,

89
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,613
surfrider foundation because he didn't 
want it because it was going to destroy 

90
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:23,470
the wave and ultimately destroy the 
national park there.

91
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,940
And so he was big on that kind of stuff.
And so I've always been,

92
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,343
you know,
sort of following in his footsteps and 

93
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:31,904
hang on,
we gotta we gotta get in front of this 

94
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:36,650
problem.
Did you dad's clint eastwood crazy.

95
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,440
Yeah.
That is so crazy.

96
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,570
What is it like having Clint Eastwood as
a dad?

97
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,240
What's Your Dad do?
My Dad is clinics would bitch would just

98
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,290
be like,
oh shit.

99
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,720
He just walk away confused like what 
happened to me.

100
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:54,721
I just got hit with a rock and you look 
like a weird,

101
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,523
like when I'm looking at you,
I see your dad like from the old outlaw 

102
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:00,780
Josey Wales days.
Yeah,

103
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,391
yeah,
yeah.

104
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,224
It's,
you know what's crazy is looking at 

105
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,360
photos of him when he was 12 and I was 
12 a,

106
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,730
you cannot tell the difference.
You put them in both in black and white.

107
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,350
You can't tell the difference.
Wow.

108
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,520
Yeah.
That's a trip.

109
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,553
Yeah.
What was it like growing up with him as 

110
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,120
a dad?
When did you realize like,

111
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:20,920
Holy Shit,
I think I realized I'm 31,

112
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:23,800
so I'd probably realized when I was 
about eight,

113
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,870
I watched unforgiven.
Yeah,

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,420
he let you watch that when you were 
eight.

115
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,523
That's my favorite movie ever.
That high plains drifter is right up 

116
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:34,864
there too.
Wow.

117
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,140
I don't know.

118
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,580
It's,
it's hard to lock them down,

119
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,200
but the unforgiven is a dark movie man.
It's dark money.

120
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,210
William money killer of women and 
children.

121
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,940
That's a dark movie,
man.

122
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:48,310
Y'All got to come in.
What he says in that,

123
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:49,144
when I learned that I'm just like 
probably one of the most realistic 

124
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,234
killers too,
like the way handled stuff and the way 

125
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:57,250
everybody else was like falling apart.
You never saw that in those movies.

126
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,300
What was it about regret?
It was about a,

127
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,480
a life filled of,
uh,

128
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,323
of regret and filled the things that you
did wrong that you wish you could have 

129
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,580
done better.
And um,

130
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,723
you know,
it was sort of a last one last ride to 

131
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,350
be,
to do something better for his kids,

132
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,300
you know,
so that,

133
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,610
I think that was sort of interesting.
It was,

134
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:19,210
it was sort of a final culmination of 
all his westerns.

135
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,223
It really was.
And almost like he updated the mall too 

136
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,020
because like in the old movies,
like you'd have cowards,

137
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,550
you need to have heroes and stuff like 
that.

138
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:31,700
But in the unforgiven he took it to a 
totally different level.

139
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:33,730
Like psychologically,
you know,

140
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:34,564
like even the way he,
like the switch goes off when he starts 

141
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:41,260
drinking and then he started just 
fucking merch and everybody like the way

142
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:44,350
it was handled,
it seemed so realistic the way everybody

143
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:47,620
would fall apart and gunfights and the 
way you get to watch it again now.

144
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,870
It's been awhile now.
I'm like,

145
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,240
that sounds awesome.
Fucking great.

146
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,550
That's fucking great movie.
I remember seeing it.

147
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,653
I remember the movie I want to see in 
the movie theater and when the credits 

148
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:57,980
roll at the end,
I

149
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,980
just want to do this powerful one.
Yeah,

150
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,530
it's intense movie man.
Fucking intense.

151
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,350
So when you're eight you figured it out 
like that movie,

152
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,610
right?
It right around then.

153
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,444
Yeah,
I remember watching it and I'm not sure 

154
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:16,310
if I watch it with him or shortly after 
he had made it.

155
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,550
Um,
and just thinking,

156
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:19,384
you know,
that is the coolest thing and I want to 

157
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:22,700
do that.
You know,

158
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:26,060
I wanna I want to be in movies.
I want to tell stories like that.

159
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,220
Wow.
So how many,

160
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,940
and you have brothers and sisters and so
how did all that work?

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,691
Uh,
yeah,

162
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:33,524
I've got,
I've got a few sisters and my dad was a 

163
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,880
busy guy.
How many kids in the family?

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,070
Uh,
how many wives?

165
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,001
Uh,
yeah,

166
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,830
let's just go with that.
There's a,

167
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,310
he's only had two wives,
but he had a few,

168
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,080
few girlfriends,
few babies.

169
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,570
Mamas.
Yeah.

170
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,120
So did you live with him?
I did,

171
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,810
I did.
Uh,

172
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,150
I would bounce back and forth.
I lived with my mom.

173
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,940
I live with my mom in California until I
was about a seven or eight.

174
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,090
And then I lived.
Then we,

175
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,963
did she move,
she packed up this kind of run the time 

176
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,970
when they split,
was your mom and actress to.

177
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,710
No,
no,

178
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,931
no,
no,

179
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,550
no.
She was just a normal person.

180
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:11,480
Yeah,
flight attendant.

181
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,500
Uh,
she had two kids with my dad and uh,

182
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,140
we,
we,

183
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,973
she packed up,
I think when they sort of split and she 

184
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,374
moved to Hawaii,
she had lived there when she was a lot 

185
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:21,764
younger and so she had always loved 
Hawaii and so I had gone to Hawaii to 

186
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:26,054
live,
uh,

187
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,170
probably from about eight to about 16.
Wow.

188
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,050
Yeah.
And then they ultimately moved back with

189
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:36,410
my dad for like the last couple of years
of high school.

190
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,140
And so yeah,
it was,

191
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,370
it was an interesting upbringing,
right?

192
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,030
I mean,
you know,

193
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,790
one hand,
I was with my dad for some time and when

194
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,270
I was in Hawaii,
a living there and you know,

195
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:50,420
if you know anything about Hawaii as,
as a white boy growing up,

196
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,210
uh,
you're,

197
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:54,090
you're the minority.
Yeah.

198
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,310
So it was,
it was a lot of,

199
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:56,144
um,
a lot of fist you just show up with a 

200
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:00,240
Harley tee shirt on.
Rewarding.

201
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,570
I mean,
that's,

202
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,150
that's,
you know,

203
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,670
a lot of people don't realize that it's 
pretty,

204
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:05,504
you know,
Hawaii's very from like a warrior 

205
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,940
society still.
And,

206
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:12,290
and that's a great thing kind of because
it's still,

207
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,560
it's very primal.
Uh,

208
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,880
and it's also,
you know,

209
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,400
sort of,
it's one of those things where,

210
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,503
um,
there's not a lot of tolerance for 

211
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,970
someone that you don't know or part of 
your family.

212
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,460
Um,
and so,

213
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,211
you know,
for me it was,

214
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:27,080
it was,
it was tough.

215
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,160
It was,
it was.

216
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,900
Did they accept you eventually?
You know,

217
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,550
sports,
Sports,

218
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,990
sports really bridged that gap.
A football.

219
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,970
I played football and that was,
that really.

220
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,950
It was tough because the first year they
were like,

221
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,090
no,
they were like,

222
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,670
no,
get the fuck outta here.

223
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,030
Suck.
Um,

224
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,781
yeah,
you know,

225
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:49,570
I was,
I was a kid then I was probably,

226
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,803
I don't know,
I can't remember 10 or so playing pee 

227
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:53,714
wee football.
Right.

228
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,640
And then as,
as you know,

229
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,520
as I would,
you know,

230
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,570
prove myself that I was down for hard 
work and uh,

231
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,630
you know,
down to throw hits that,

232
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,770
you know,
that sort of,

233
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,843
you know,
a bridged the gap and then ultimately 

234
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,260
they were part of my team and then so we
would go to other schools and play other

235
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:16,740
schools and then I was still the,
the Halle boy to everybody else,

236
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,090
but they had my back now.

237
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,680
So that was cool to be a bizarre time 
man,

238
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:25,050
to be a 10 year old and all of a sudden 
be in that environment.

239
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,040
Sure,
sure.

240
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:26,700
That was,
um,

241
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,960
it was different.
It was A.

242
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,513
Yeah,
I didn't know any better,

243
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,050
so I'm going,
okay,

244
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,690
well this is what I got to deal with now
is the cards are got dealt,

245
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:36,660
so they're going to man up.
Yeah.

246
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,000
I have a bunch of buddies live in Hawaii
and you know,

247
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:41,380
they say that if you're respectful and 
you're,

248
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,214
you know,
you're not a Douche bag like after 

249
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:45,030
awhile you just fit right in and 
everybody's cool with it.

250
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,140
Yeah,
I mean it's,

251
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,700
it's,
it's uh,

252
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,510
I grew up also as a surfer,
you know,

253
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,413
as grownups,
grownups surfing and so there's 

254
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:53,274
definitely a pecking order and a respect
there that you have to learn or you're 

255
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:57,840
going to learn the hard way.

256
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,010
Um,
and,

257
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
and that's,
I think that was a good thing,

258
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,634
you know,
ultimately because it kind of humbles 

259
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:07,020
you and makes you,
makes you know your place,

260
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,120
which is good.
Did you start training Jujitsu there?

261
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,830
Uh,
I started,

262
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,341
uh,
you know,

263
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:17,580
actually I'm not.
One of my good buddies who passed away,

264
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:20,350
Paul Walker got me into a Jujitsu.
Um,

265
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,900
he got me about six years ago.
Six maybe,

266
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,230
maybe more now.
Yeah.

267
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:26,280
He was like a purple belt.
Right,

268
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:28,710
or a brown belt,
brown belt when he died.

269
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,110
Um,
and so yeah,

270
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:31,944
he,
he was,

271
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,330
I mean he was a diehard.
I mean he had a place in Hawaii actually

272
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:36,690
and he had uh,
he would,

273
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,230
he would go get matt and he would get 
his place outfitted so he could practice

274
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,440
at home.
I don't know.

275
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,230
Um,
and he got me,

276
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,330
he got me involved and that's,
you know,

277
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:48,090
that's another thing that's great about 
a over there.

278
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,710
It's like you really realize like 
obviously,

279
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:53,790
you know,
a jets is like the ultimate humbling,

280
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,113
you know,
for people especially for I think for 

281
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:59,710
men carry a lot of ego around or carry a
lot of,

282
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,800
you know,
you know,

283
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,110
I think as men we're trying to figure 
out who we are,

284
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:04,944
especially when we're young,
it really calms your ego down because 

285
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:09,840
you always know,
you know,

286
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,450
I'm going to choke some people out and 
people are going to choke me out.

287
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,790
And it's just,
no matter what level you're at,

288
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,130
you also get it out of your system.
Like the one,

289
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,003
the big part of what men do,
they puff their chest up because they 

290
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:23,430
weren't prove themselves and they 
haven't yet and they don't know.

291
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:24,950
And so they want to like put up this 
air,

292
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,540
like there's some bad mother fucker 
because they're insecure,

293
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,410
they don't know.
And once you've done it a bunch of times

294
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:33,540
and you know,
trained for a few years,

295
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,740
it just,
it all comes down.

296
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,020
Yeah.
You notice all the,

297
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,290
all the guys who do it consistently or 
the high level guys,

298
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,410
just Socom,
socom.

299
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,790
And that's actually one thing I noticed 
about cameron too.

300
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,803
He's like,
he's a calm motherfucker because he's 

301
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,290
spends a lot of time out in the 
wilderness and I think that as a big,

302
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,400
uh,
you know,

303
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:56,110
with the world we live in now,
today.

304
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,090
Yeah,
we were.

305
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,270
Yeah.
And we talked about,

306
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,250
we talked about this,
some,

307
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,560
some of the experiences,
the stressful experiences and the hard,

308
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,830
I mean,
life here is never hard.

309
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,420
Really the challenges we face in the 
regular everyday traffic dude,

310
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,210
sometimes the line at starbucks is huge.
I know that.

311
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:15,044
Okay,
that's hard.

312
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,220
Okay.
So aside from that tough cam with a k,

313
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,220
right,
but so I mean it puts it in perspective,

314
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:23,750
it's just Kinda like what you're saying.
But yeah,

315
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:24,584
you need to experiences like that.
Just you kind of simulate those in 

316
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:28,570
training or,
and you know,

317
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,300
the hunts that I do or the races that I 
do and it keeps it in perspective so you

318
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:34,400
don't get wound up over the little 
stuff.

319
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,263
It's like no Biggie,
but it's also like there's a humbling 

320
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,450
just being in the woods.
Yeah.

321
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,200
You just realize like,
oh this,

322
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,710
this doesn't matter if I never existed 
now,

323
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,583
like if human beings would never 
invented these woods would be exactly 

324
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:48,950
like this.

325
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,783
Now that I've thought about that a lot,
I've been in the mountains and united 

326
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:54,920
say if something happens,
if you know,

327
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,870
who knows,
you die for whatever reason,

328
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,540
nothing,
their changes and I oda,

329
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,350
I mean it's nothing.
So it's like your existence doesn't even

330
00:13:03,351 --> 00:13:08,090
matter and I think we need to,
we feel too self important sometimes.

331
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:08,924
I think some people do.
And so in that situation and you're 

332
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:12,500
like,
okay,

333
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,450
this I'm,
I'm,

334
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,680
you know,
nothing really.

335
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,630
My friend Ryan Callahan,
you know Ryan from firstlight?

336
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,533
Yeah.
He was out in the woods with a two 

337
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,240
friend of his and they,
uh,

338
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,343
they,
they work for the park rangers or 

339
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:29,960
something and they found a human skull 
and they're like,

340
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:31,250
whoa.
And it just,

341
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,593
just puts it all in perspective,
like deep deep in the back country and 

342
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:38,840
you find a human skull and it's just 
like,

343
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:39,501
okay,
yeah,

344
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:40,334
this is real,
this was a person and something went 

345
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,140
wrong and they just never really ever 
found them.

346
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:47,600
And you know,
just happens to be a bear.

347
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:49,490
Could be a cat,
could be a tricky one.

348
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

349
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,340
I mean lightening happens a lot to 
people.

350
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:53,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

351
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,610
But

352
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,570
I was,
I was uh,

353
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,850
I was telling you the other day,
Cameron about a,

354
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,640
I've been here a lot of reading about,
um,

355
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,920
about like circadian rhythms and in our 
inner body because a,

356
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,900
I've had chronic,
a sleepwalking chronic night terrors,

357
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,310
uh,
since I was a little kid.

358
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,233
What does night terrors,
what's the difference in night terrors 

359
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:12,580
and sleep parking?
Uh,

360
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,170
I dunno,
I mean I've had both.

361
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,450
So what is the night terrors?
Night terror would be,

362
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,513
you know,
sort of,

363
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,020
you wake up in the middle of night to 
scream,

364
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:20,880
yelling,
well,

365
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,930
that's in the middle of the bedroom.
Um,

366
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,500
uh,
and they can sort of,

367
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,040
I think they can coincide with 
sleepwalking probably,

368
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,400
you know,
so stress related.

369
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,230
I think so,
um,

370
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,160
it's hard to say I got him,
uh,

371
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,280
when I was young,
when I started getting them.

372
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,440
Uh,
I think when I was about in sixth grade,

373
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,890
um,
so I don't know if it was,

374
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,370
if it was a,
if a stress related or what it was,

375
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,200
um,
but I started getting them and then,

376
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,590
um,
you know,

377
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,780
I've had,
I've had them in 31 now.

378
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,003
And so I've been reading a lot about 
that and I obviously listened to your 

379
00:14:58,341 --> 00:15:00,610
podcast a lot about,
um,

380
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,070
just about the way humans are supposed 
to operate in the natural life cycle.

381
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,660
Right?
And you know,

382
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,493
you,
you wake up in the morning because it 

383
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:10,454
gets light and you go to bed because it 
gets dark and we're screwing it all up 

384
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:18,680
with the TVS and the phones and,
and all the stuff.

385
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:19,514
And anytime I've ever been willingness 
to do a lot of backpacking and been a 

386
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,350
lot of hunting trips and fishing and 
stuff,

387
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,830
it's,
it really calms my body down a lot.

388
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,453
And uh,
what they said was in all the reading 

389
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:35,000
I've done is,
is that um,

390
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,343
your,
your creation of Melatonin is in your 

391
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:42,260
optics because of assimilation of light.
So when it gets dark,

392
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,123
you're,
your mind supposed to create more 

393
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:47,300
Melatonin,
which obviously puts you to sleep.

394
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,260
But because we don't have that or we're,
we're manipulating that,

395
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,090
it's uh,
it's changed everything.

396
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,970
That's why they invented ambien.
Yeah,

397
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,520
works great.
I mean,

398
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:58,354
it's just a lot of people out there that
are taken pills that just knocked them 

399
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:01,954
out just nor to deal with the fact that 
we're constantly surrounded by lights 

400
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:06,694
and staring at your phone before you go 
to bed and watching TV and go to the 

401
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:11,890
bathroom and the light's bright.
Your body doesn't know what that is.

402
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,520
And that's when we were talking about 
this yesterday.

403
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:16,480
It's,
like I said,

404
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:17,314
I've never been born at peace and 
relaxed and slept as well as I have in 

405
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:22,480
the mountains.
You know,

406
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,430
once there's an adjustment period,
it seems like,

407
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,840
sure.
But once I'm there,

408
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,703
it's just like I've never been at a,
I don't want to make it sound like 

409
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:33,730
anything bad at home,
but I've never been more.

410
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,770
Uh,
I don't.

411
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:38,710
I don't know if it's happy or just more 
content content.

412
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,710
That's exactly right.
More content than I am in the mountains.

413
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:45,100
It feels like that's just natural.
That's how it's supposed to be.

414
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,173
Well,
people really are supposed to interface 

415
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:48,634
with the wild,
with the wilderness the same way all 

416
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:51,724
animals are.
We've just created these weird 

417
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:53,704
structures over the past few thousand 
years when you really think about 

418
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:59,620
civilization that we only figured out 
how to talk 40,000 years ago,

419
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,800
you know,
either we'll write.

420
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,820
That was,
you know,

421
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,950
I'm in.
Yeah,

422
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,930
I think the wheel is five.
10.

423
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,890
No.
Yeah,

424
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,940
it's a little little longer than that.
At somewhere around 6,000 years ago.

425
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:16,190
They figured out the wheel,
which is just hilarious with here's,

426
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,890
here's the best way to put that in 
perspective.

427
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,863
Like,
so let's say it's 50 slash 500 years 

428
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:21,154
ago.
That's essentially a person lives to be 

429
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:25,060
100.
That's 55 people.

430
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,360
50th five people go.
They were just dragging shit around.

431
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,210
That's.
That's insane.

432
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,430
That's insane.
Yeah.

433
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,320
People go and then before that,
you know,

434
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,620
you just go back a few more people and 
they were grunting.

435
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,621
Yeah.
I mean they,

436
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:40,454
they,
they hadn't even figured out how to 

437
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,850
write things down.
They know it's really important

438
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,070
even,
you know,

439
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,903
what's,
what's even crazier to think about is 

440
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,160
how we've taken airplanes and perfected 
that in the last

441
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,570
50 years.
You know,

442
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,920
before that it was,
you know,

443
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:54,870
you didn't,
you couldn't just get on an airplane and

444
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,330
be anywhere in the world in 24 hours.
Oh yeah.

445
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,190
Totally.
Parents 19.

446
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,024
Oh three.
You want to hear the craziest fucking 

447
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:02,100
statistics.
Emer.

448
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,063
Okay.
Between the time that plane was 

449
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:06,050
invented,
the,

450
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:06,884
between the invention of the airplane 
and someone dropping an atomic bomb out 

451
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:11,280
of the airplane,
it was less than 50 years.

452
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,710
Yeah,
that's crazy.

453
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:14,544
What we do to each other.
It was like somewhere like 44 years or 

454
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:21,540
something like that.
Between the invention of the airplane by

455
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,374
the Wright brothers.
The first flight and then a bomb 

456
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,360
dropping on Hiroshima.
Yeah.

457
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,720
And then now they're fast and furious.
Eight bombs wise plug.

458
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,650
There is good.
You should go.

459
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,840
Just totally unrelated.
Just thought of that.

460
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,570
How many of those have you done?
No,

461
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,290
this is the first one that I've done.
This is the first one.

462
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,430
Yeah,
this is the eighth.

463
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,560
This will be the eighth one and they're 
going to do 10.

464
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,394
Right.
So they're doing them back to back 

465
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:51,940
because what they're doing,
I didn't.

466
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,830
That's the plan.
Uh,

467
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,610
you know,
I'm not,

468
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,630
I'm not sure.
Vin,

469
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,940
vin diesel and the producers have,
you know,

470
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,080
the plan set.
But I mean that's the whispers.

471
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:04,840
I hear that we do a couple more.
I think we have tended to be cool.

472
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,990
We made it this far.
Might as well go to 10 right now.

473
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,880
Can you tell us,
does your character survive?

474
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,410
Can you give us a spoiler alert?

475
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,500
I saw the movie.
He said,

476
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,353
you can tell us then you're not 
obviously if you didn't have to sign 

477
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:17,484
anything.
Did you?

478
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,440
Was it was good last night.
I mean,

479
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,070
Scott had a big role.
It was,

480
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,940
it was cool because I didn't know,
you know,

481
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,650
you never know,
didn't,

482
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:26,880
didn't ask,
didn't anything.

483
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:28,830
But yeah,
he's all over it the whole time.

484
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:29,990
So it was cool.
He did a good job.

485
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,640
Let's just say it's a good one and 
everyone will like it.

486
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,500
Or you also car guide.
Do you like muscle cross?

487
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,250
Yeah,
I'm a,

488
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,610
I'm a classic car guy.
I like classics.

489
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,444
I love the old sixties Ferrari between 
Ferrari and for that whole rivalry back 

490
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:46,650
then.
So the GTS.

491
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,150
Exactly,
exactly.

492
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:48,984
I'm actually getting a,
getting the opportunity to purchase a 

493
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,230
one of the new GTS,
a coming out in 2017.

494
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,720
Really do that thing looks insane.

495
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,640
Insane.
And they're making only 100 this year.

496
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,970
Punch I hundred,
100.

497
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,293
One hundred and 7 billion people.
You're gonna make 100 cars as 

498
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,850
collectibles.
Well what so,

499
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,090
so what?
I mean,

500
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:15,120
how much do they charge for those?
For 100 bucks or 100 of them or.

501
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:18,450
I mean,
I think the price is about three.

502
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,590
Three slash 50.
Three hundred $50,000 collected.

503
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,650
It's a beast.
Look at that thing.

504
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,940
That's the new one.
Sanity configurator,

505
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:32,000
you can fit why they let and you 
configure it.

506
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,150
If you can't even fucking buy it.
Just bunch of teases forward.

507
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,690
What are you doing that doesn't even 
look like a Ford?

508
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,780
I mean that looks.
That looks like a Ford on planet Mars.

509
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,210
Change in the code that lets you can 
crap.

510
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,710
It was better than a Ferrari.

511
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,630
You know?
That sounds bad.

512
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:51,400
Ass Car.
Let me see the.

513
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,380
See if you got some other angles on it.
Is there any other angles?

514
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,370
We'll look at a pretty good.
Oh my God.

515
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,400
So cammo on reaper option.
Look at that.

516
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:08,200
Fucking God.
Oh my God.

517
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:11,050
What a beast.
I think I might get one to actually.

518
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,930
Wow,
go for it dude.

519
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,660
Go for it.
My whole life of a salary,

520
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,793
but that's $350,000.
But meanwhile the way they're making 

521
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:24,910
cars today,
that thing is going to be insane.

522
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,080
But that'll be like a piece of art.
You know that that will be,

523
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,890
you know,
like the GTA,

524
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:34,240
knowing the older gts that have gone up 
in value because they just don't,

525
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,460
you know,
it's hard to say that.

526
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,190
What about new cars though?
So much plastic and stuff.

527
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:41,860
They just don't seem to.
People don't want them.

528
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,560
You know,
like if you get a 19 sixties car,

529
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,990
it's worth a shitload of money today.

530
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,830
But in the 19 nineties,
current worth shit.

531
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,183
You know what I mean?
It's like there's no classics from 

532
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,500
Nineteen Ninety is a couple Porsha's 
like 99,

533
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,830
six floors from the nineties or the last
of the air cooled cars.

534
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:01,870
They're still worth some money there.
They're classics,

535
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,943
but that's kind of it.
Like maybe a few classic Ferrari's from 

536
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:08,080
that day,
but like a Camaro from 1990.

537
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:13,300
Push that thing off a cliff and shoot at
it while it's on its way down.

538
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,640
Hey,
don't let your girl drive that car.

539
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,190
She got issues were saying before she 
crashes things.

540
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,260
A little bit of a history of a long 
history.

541
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,470
Let's leave it at that.
Listen,

542
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,530
people can't be great at everything,
you know?

543
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,430
That's true.
Have you seen the new Acura Nsx?

544
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,290
No.
Jesus Christ.

545
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,940
Look at this thing.
Jamie.

546
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,320
Pull that up.
If you're into cars,

547
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,860
you know,
accurate built the last Nsx in 2005.

548
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,980
So there's like 12 years off before the,
they came out with a new one,

549
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,300
they just came up with a new one this 
year.

550
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,250
It's just this spaceship,
this monster,

551
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:50,900
a spaceships.
You'll find a silver one.

552
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:55,020
So I that when they do that with cars,
they sort of wait a long time to get,

553
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:57,130
you know,
come up with a whole new concept.

554
00:22:57,131 --> 00:23:00,150
Not just a every three or four years.
Four wheel drive.

555
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,090
Yeah,
totally.

556
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:01,661
Yeah.
No,

557
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:06,580
I like it to four wheel drive,
electric wheels on the front.

558
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,240
It's at.
It's tough looking at that one.

559
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:12,940
After the Ford is.
Well that's not a good angle.

560
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,860
Same Angle here with Ford,
but no,

561
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,300
love that for.
What are you talking about?

562
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,980
Get off the site,
the site bullshit.

563
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,680
They get you with the Kelley Blue Book.
That's it.

564
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,593
Click save.
You can see a three quarter view in the 

565
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,370
upper left hand side right there.
Nope.

566
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,110
Yeah,
look at that too.

567
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,300
Dope car man.
When you see one in real life,

568
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,460
it looks like a spaceship.
It really does.

569
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,630
Yeah.
It looks cool.

570
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,040
This first today,
ma'am.

571
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,550
But that's like looking at,
uh,

572
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,690
the new hoyt,
then looking at the Ross,

573
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,543
Beau,
really you think that you don't think 

574
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,940
that looks as good but not as good as a 
four?

575
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,300
Does it pretty close?
I don't know,

576
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:51,134
Dude.
Everybody's got different tastes 

577
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:52,634
campaigns.

578
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,723
I just can't wait for the self driving 
because people just are terrible 

579
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:02,180
drivers.
So let's just,

580
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:04,430
let's just get on with that.
We've figured that out.

581
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:06,110
Everyone's talking about these kinds of 
cars.

582
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,150
Well that's fine.
Just let him be self taught or you know,

583
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,490
that's not going to be self driving.
They'll be ridiculous.

584
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,890
Imagine if you have a car like that,
like a Ford gt,

585
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:15,860
but it's self driving.
Unless you're on a race track,

586
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,850
you'd be like,
what am I going to live on a race track?

587
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,793
So stupid.
There's something that happening as 

588
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:22,544
we're making things autonomous,
we're going to lose a little bit of 

589
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:25,640
something.
Sure,

590
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,593
sure.
Sort of the one of the reasons why 

591
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:28,034
people like handmade stuff now,
like you'd get a pair of handmade boots 

592
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:31,300
or something like that.
It was like,

593
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,420
Ooh,
it feels different.

594
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,703
You know,
I got,

595
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,520
these are handmade.

596
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Lou Casey's Casey's handmade.
They know me like 11 days to do,

597
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,260
to do from start to finish.
Well,

598
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,710
not the lettering and stuff they do.
I mean they do at different stages,

599
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,993
but I mean they're the best place in the
market and it doesn't that feel 

600
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:50,030
different.
Like when you have them,

601
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,950
like there's something knowing that 
person made it too.

602
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,590
Yep.
Well they're just so comfortable.

603
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,770
Yeah.
I made cowboy boots.

604
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,070
Cowboy boots normally aren't that 
comfortable,

605
00:24:58,071 --> 00:25:00,550
but those.
That's what my boots were yesterday too.

606
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,230
So Nice.
I was reading this podcast,

607
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,270
reading a podcast or listening to 
podcasts,

608
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,380
listening to a book about a horseback 
riding,

609
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:12,614
and this guy was explaining how people 
try to wear like hiking boots when they 

610
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:17,840
go horseback riding and they jam their 
fruit.

611
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,973
He's like,
there's a reason why cowboy boots fall 

612
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:21,254
off so easy.
It's so you don't get dragged behind a 

613
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:25,730
frightened horse like it's supposed to 
happen that way.

614
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,310
That's why they're pointed.
So they slide in and slide out.

615
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,980
They slide in and slide out and they 
slip right off your feet.

616
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,843
Yeah.
Yep.

617
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,380
And you have,
you get a good pair of these.

618
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:36,200
I mean they'll last 10,
20 and it lasts a lifetime.

619
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,430
You know what I mean?
It could.

620
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,750
I just bought,
I got my,

621
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,643
the ones I had yesterday which were like
a thousand bucks and I just got them 

622
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,140
resoled because I'd worn them so much.
Seventy,

623
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,410
70 4:50 brand new soles on.
I mean brand new boots.

624
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,950
I've heard that since you have your own 
under armour sneaker,

625
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,720
that you're the Kanye west of bad 
assets.

626
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,350
Is this true?
I don't know what that means.

627
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,770
None of the Kanye west of bowhunting.
Oh,

628
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,140
well,
because Kanye West has yeezys.

629
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,890
Do you know what Yeezys on his shoe?
Jamie buys them.

630
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,780
Look,
he's on yet.

631
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,380
He's such a Weirdo.
He's got like five pairs on this Weirdo.

632
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,480
So I don't even know what.
Hey,

633
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,530
see,
that's what the kids are.

634
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,260
Gaming aren't.
Those are a lot like expensive,

635
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,250
stupid,
expensive.

636
00:26:20,251 --> 00:26:21,740
He can't get them when they come on 
sale.

637
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,080
They are a lot like how much are they 
reading the gate?

638
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,943
Uh,
the ones that are going to resale that 

639
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:28,250
come out this month,
they're reselling for 2000 right now.

640
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:29,084
They're 200 retail,
200 retail and they sell for $2,000 

641
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,210
because they make what,
100 pair like that.

642
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,370
Goddamn.
You can get a free one with the Ford Gt.

643
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:39,800
Yeah,
so I think so.

644
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,673
Anyway.
I think that's how Brendan's references 

645
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,670
tied.
It's shoot Kanye shoe.

646
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,690
Yes.
That's what it is.

647
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,653
Yeah.
It's not that you're an egotistical 

648
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:51,480
autistic rapper.
Not that I see him at.

649
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,250
He was at the UFC fight.
I don't know.

650
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,230
I was at college there.

651
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

652
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,360
I don't know which one it was,
but yeah,

653
00:26:57,361 --> 00:26:58,194
that's right.
He was there with a boyfriend that j lo 

654
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:05,010
dumped because he went to the UFC.
It was one of conner's fights.

655
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:05,780
Oh,
was it?

656
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,930
That's what it was.
Yeah.

657
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,793
The boyfriend wanted to go to the,
to the Mcgregor fight and Jayla was 

658
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:10,764
like,
fuck that.

659
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,090
She's staying with me.
Jamie got a picture with them.

660
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,360
Kanye hearsay.
But here's Kanye West.

661
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,330
Even at the UFC fight just like this.
Well,

662
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:23,640
I saw him smile a few times when you met
some people.

663
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,300
Really?
Yeah,

664
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,790
but he's.
He needs a hug.

665
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,650
A smile.
Did Dee did you.

666
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,240
What'd you do?
He didn't smile.

667
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,910
Not your picture.
Did he pulled up?

668
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,580
What'd you do to get them to smile or to
go?

669
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,480
Well,
he's uh,

670
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,330
he needs a hug.
That's what I think needs a hug and some

671
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:40,164
good friends.

672
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,240
Something to calm them down.
I think so,

673
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:43,051
yeah.
Settled down.

674
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:45,090
Dude.
When we talk to you about your Prenup,

675
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,400
you got one right?
That's what I would say.

676
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,570
Areas that is not smile will smart.
No,

677
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,720
not really.
No,

678
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:53,923
it's not.
You're just the smile from Tony 

679
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,650
Hinchcliffe is bouncing off.
You didn't smile.

680
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,390
So he was like,
why am I fucking smile off?

681
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:03,000
This dude isn't smiling.
You didn't even happen to meet me.

682
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:03,834
Fuck why even taken a picture?
Hashtag blessed at least he's got to 

683
00:28:09,281 --> 00:28:10,920
clock on his,
on his shirt.

684
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,350
He's got 10 minutes in that regard.
That's the best thing about that.

685
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:15,000
Other than Jamie and Tony.
Yes,

686
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,320
I agree.
The Tupac shirts.

687
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,700
Good move.
Good move.

688
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,813
If you're,
you know,

689
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,723
I don't know.
The rapper world is a very fucking 

690
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:23,670
strange world.
I can't even imagine.

691
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,610
I can't even imagine now.
But Hey,

692
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,330
I did want to ask something.
So when you were growing up,

693
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,910
was there a pressure because your dad 
was Clint Eastwood,

694
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,163
did you get,
and then you said you wanted to be an 

695
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,750
actor,
you knew was that,

696
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,630
was that we're going back to it,
but I just want.

697
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,710
It's good.
Good question.

698
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,120
Well,
I think,

699
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,520
I think I always wanted to be a tell 
stores.

700
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:46,620
I don't know if I necessarily knew I 
wanted to be an actor.

701
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,840
I think as I get older I realize it's 
more about telling stories.

702
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,750
Um,
I just sort of fell into the acting.

703
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:55,201
I was like,
okay,

704
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,570
well this could be a way I could get in.
I could,

705
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,003
I could go into that.
You just enjoy the entertainment 

706
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:01,854
process,
like creating something that people are 

707
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,350
entertained by and enjoy.
Yeah,

708
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:05,184
exactly.
Telling a story that people can relate 

709
00:29:07,261 --> 00:29:08,160
to,
laugh,

710
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:09,090
cry,
whatever.

711
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:09,983
Do you think you'll go the route of your
dad and maybe do some directing and 

712
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,900
writing things on the plan.
That's the plan.

713
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,500
That's the plan.
You know,

714
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,830
taking control of your own career,
uh,

715
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,850
is,
is good.

716
00:29:21,851 --> 00:29:23,510
And it's also,
you know,

717
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,403
you tell the stories you want to tell 
and we were talking about this before 

718
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,264
the podcast that the world of the actor,
it's very difficult and a lot of people 

719
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:30,864
like accused actors of being fake.
And I think one of the reasons for 

720
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:35,290
narcissistic,
yeah,

721
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,663
that for sure,
but one of the reasons for the accusing 

722
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:42,130
them of being fake is that they always 
have to put on

723
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,963
the best show,
like as far as their behavior and the 

724
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:45,724
way they act and think and their 
opinions because they're constantly 

725
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:51,520
trying to get cast in things and it's 
all about getting people to like you and

726
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:52,780
politicking.
And,

727
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:53,763
and we were talking also about like,
you kinda have to have liberal 

728
00:29:56,381 --> 00:30:01,180
sensibilities like in this town if you,
if you are a right going together,

729
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,420
does that even make sense?
It seems like they contradict each other

730
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,570
a liberal sensibilities as well.

731
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,730
The reason I moved,
uh,

732
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,030
moved out to La is,
you know,

733
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,180
years ago,
uh,

734
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,380
I just,
I got sick of either are great.

735
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,080
They're great people in La,
you know,

736
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,560
I'm,
I'm from California,

737
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:21,450
so I feel have a,
you know,

738
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,390
as a place in my heart here.
Um,

739
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,080
but I got to la because,
you know,

740
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:27,914
if you meet 100 people in La,
you might meet in [inaudible] 95 that 

741
00:30:30,381 --> 00:30:32,280
are full of Shit and you know,
five good ones.

742
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,510
Uh,
and,

743
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,230
and that

744
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,050
generous that.
Yeah,

745
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,913
it's a problem.
Right?

746
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,180
And everyone's always.

747
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,493
I always judge it when,
when I meet somebody and I'm having a 

748
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:44,220
conversation with them and I asked how 
they're doing,

749
00:30:44,221 --> 00:30:45,840
you know,
meet an actor or something.

750
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,960
How have you been working on a cool.
And you know,

751
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,880
a lot of times they're just waiting for 
their turn to talk.

752
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,150
You're not even listening to you,
you're just sort of,

753
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,991
you know,
did you,

754
00:30:53,991 --> 00:30:55,620
you know,
they're not going to return that and say

755
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,850
hello,
what are you doing?

756
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:57,684
What you know,
what's going on?

757
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,603
Yeah.
You don't feel like it's sincere 

758
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:00,914
conversation?
No,

759
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,610
not,
not at all.

760
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,443
Yeah.
That's a big issue with people in 

761
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:05,540
general.
But in la it's,

762
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,860
I think this is the magnet for all the 
narcissists and all the people that want

763
00:31:09,861 --> 00:31:12,260
attention and the people that have a 
whole,

764
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:13,094
they have a whole,
they need to fill up for whatever their 

765
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:16,370
childhood,
whatever,

766
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,140
whatever the fuck it is.
And they,

767
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,520
they gravitate here and then they just 
communicate with each other the same way

768
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,120
and everybody kinda like pretends to be 
someone who they're not.

769
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,283
And then hopefully they make it and then
once they make it then they just become 

770
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:32,650
some fucking Weirdo.
Just,

771
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,703
it's,
it's weird how many of them are like 

772
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:36,410
almost like cookie cutter.
Like,

773
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,240
Oh,
I've met that guy before.

774
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,030
He just looked different.
You know what I mean?

775
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:41,864
It's like,
it's like the same person living a 

776
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:44,390
different life.

777
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:49,390
I know this assembly line before they 
fell asleep or something,

778
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,243
but the actor world is like,
I've met a lot of comedians that are 

779
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:55,430
similar,
but there are a lot.

780
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,830
They're very so much.
But the actors,

781
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,200
boy,
there's a lot that are super similar.

782
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,870
Just a lot of you know.
But then again,

783
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:03,704
you'll meet some of them who've like 
figured it out and made it through and 

784
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:06,404
they're super normal and real.
Like Adam Sandler is one of the nicest 

785
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:10,670
guys you've ever met.
Your lovely.

786
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,490
Oh my God.
He couldn't be nicer.

787
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,553
Totally.
Like if you didn't know he was Adam 

788
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,270
Sandler and you met him,
you'd be like,

789
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:17,180
ah,
someone's dad.

790
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,180
Fucking super normal dude.
Yeah.

791
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,250
Tom Hanks,
you said super normal.

792
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:23,480
That's what people say,
you know,

793
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:24,710
like,
because they asked me,

794
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,060
Oh,
how's Scott?

795
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,920
You know,
seems normal.

796
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,970
So that's why.
That's why.

797
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,690
So you must not know me yet because it 
actor is like,

798
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,260
I don't know who am I to say who's 
normal?

799
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,960
Right.
But to me it seems like a normal guy.

800
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,480
And you said Adam Sandler over 
completely normal.

801
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:49,100
So that's Kinda puts it in perspective.
My normal is like the,

802
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,720
you could talk to them and they're 
really,

803
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,150
they're,
they're real sincere.

804
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,683
The president president having a real 
conversation with you and there's a lot 

805
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:57,524
of people that just don't do that.
You talked to them and they're just 

806
00:32:59,121 --> 00:32:59,954
putting on some.
He definitely no trust people who are 

807
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,450
too nice.
I'm like,

808
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,510
why are they so nice like this?
This isn't right.

809
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,260
It's just a tough world for these people
anyway,

810
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:14,150
especially with the ones that haven't 
made it out here.

811
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:14,984
It's so psychologically devastating 
because you're constantly going on 

812
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:20,480
auditions and you constantly getting 
rejected so you're insecure in the first

813
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:21,314
place and then you are hoping someone 
likes you so you'd go to this thing and 

814
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,950
you're kind of like putting on your best
behavior and you're dressing good.

815
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,220
Like hi,
pleased to meet you a nice.

816
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,240
Alright.
Alright.

817
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,751
Hey.
Hey,

818
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:34,310
thanks guys.
Thanks for the opportunity.

819
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:37,060
And we've like,
you know,

820
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,870
like they said you sucked at the 
audition.

821
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,710
I didn't suck.
Yeah,

822
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,280
they just really didn't like you.
They said you didn't make eye contact.

823
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:47,300
Fuck man.
People get weirder and weirder.

824
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:49,910
And if you meet an actor,
say like,

825
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:50,744
uh,
like one year and then you meet them 10 

826
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:54,410
years later and they're still swinging 
and nothing's happening.

827
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,920
They might be like,
almost ready to crack.

828
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,013
Like right at that,
falling down with that Michael Douglas 

829
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,180
when he's fucking and he's got the 
briefcase and he goes and traffic starts

830
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,080
shooting people like that,
like a couple of days before the.

831
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,510
They're like,
take it anymore.

832
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,100
It's a fucking devastating business.
Right.

833
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,550
It's tough.
It's tough.

834
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,620
But you know,
like,

835
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,430
I mean we were talking about before,
it's,

836
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,693
it's all,
it's all built on hard work and your 

837
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:25,420
reputation.
Yeah.

838
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,660
Because like you said,
you know,

839
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:29,150
and you can get a reputation for being 
an asshole or,

840
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:32,140
or you know,
showing up late to work or this down the

841
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:33,980
other and you know,
everyone's gonna know about it.

842
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:37,150
So it's a small place.
La or being a diva in a diva.

843
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,621
That's a big one.
Right.

844
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:41,100
That's not a good.
That's not a good additive for.

845
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,430
Can't shake that one.
Yeah.

846
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,590
That happens to people.
Like in Hollywood,

847
00:34:44,591 --> 00:34:46,780
they'll be doing a lot of big movies and
you hear like,

848
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,580
oh,
she's difficult to work with.

849
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,060
They just fucking disappear.
Sure.

850
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,663
And it's almost seems like Hollywood 
delights and shutting those people out 

851
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,550
there.
They're written for you to fail.

852
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:58,970
Yeah.
They kinda.

853
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,063
But one you prove to be like ungrateful 
in some way or like here's a perfect 

854
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:07,300
example where he kind of made it on 
television,

855
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:08,134
but you remember David Caruso when David
Caruso was on Nyp de blue and what he 

856
00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:12,071
was like,
wow,

857
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:15,760
this guy's a great actor.
And then he quit and ypd blue and it was

858
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:16,594
this massive hit show and then went and 
started doing like some real shitty 

859
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:21,664
movies and everybody was like,
why the fuck would you quit a big show 

860
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,920
like Nyp de blue and do a bunch of 
movies.

861
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,000
Like boy,
I hope he fails.

862
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,160
And then the movies failed.
And then everybody's like,

863
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:34,620
Yay.
And then never did a movie again.

864
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,463
You never saw him in a good mood.
Like he like had this of this amazing 

865
00:35:38,251 --> 00:35:39,090
career.
Yeah.

866
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,013
Danny became this caricature because 
then he was doing that stupid cop show 

867
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:47,280
where we take his glasses off and say 
some stupid pun.

868
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,140
Well it looks like he got nailed in your
tickets.

869
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:51,923
Remember that?
It was like CSI Miami or something like 

870
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:57,900
that.
And it was a fucking caricature of a cop

871
00:35:57,901 --> 00:35:58,734
show.
Whereas nyt PD blue when he was on it 

872
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,180
was groundbreaking.
I mean,

873
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:05,340
it was fucking fantastic.
So what happened?

874
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,820
It just became an,
I don't know,

875
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,280
I don't know who he is being recognized 
as a diva,

876
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:13,920
whether or not he was actually a diva.
I don't know the guy,

877
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,670
you'd have to meet him and talk to them 
and hang out with them,

878
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,710
but he had that stink and you get that 
steak on it.

879
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,870
That's the other thing too,
is it's not even,

880
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,723
you know,
in Hollywood is not even what's true 

881
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:25,500
sometimes it's just perceived.
It's so,

882
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,080
it's [inaudible].
My Dad used to always say he say,

883
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,560
uh,
believe half of what you see and none of

884
00:36:30,561 --> 00:36:32,190
what you're here.
And,

885
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,140
and that always stuck with me because,
you know,

886
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,850
you sit down with people in the industry
or whatever and you just hear,

887
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,230
know a lot of Hollywood gossip,
right?

888
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,064
It's a full of gossip queens.
Everybody wants to talk shit about 

889
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,720
someone they worked with or tell some 
story,

890
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,120
tell how difficult somebody was or this,
that.

891
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,610
And you don't even,
you know,

892
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:53,370
it's a business built on,
you know,

893
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:55,290
it's a,
it's just a house of cards,

894
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,251
you know,
you're like,

895
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:58,320
well that how didn't even know that 
that's even true,

896
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,420
you know,
so it's Kinda fucked up.

897
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,260
It's,
you know,

898
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,103
I mean,
I don't feel like that happens in other 

899
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:05,010
businesses,
but may,

900
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,300
May.
Maybe it does with coworkers.

901
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:06,650
I don't know.

902
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,640
I don't.
Maybe it does.

903
00:37:07,641 --> 00:37:08,474
It's also,
there's a weird thing because when 

904
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:13,910
you're a movie star like yourself in,
you're on the screen,

905
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,850
like you get all the adulation and all 
the love.

906
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:19,070
There's a whole crew of people behind 
you.

907
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,640
This special effects people and lighting
and sound and its directors and Jamie,

908
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,953
Jamie,
Jamie is 100 people to everyone that's 

909
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:32,530
on the screen.
Right?

910
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,210
And so,
and they get no love,

911
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,973
right?
They get no,

912
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,043
they're going to 11.
And that's where the business side of 

913
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:40,754
the businesses.
So delusion because the agents and the 

914
00:37:43,191 --> 00:37:44,024
people around us,
they're not the ones they're putting in 

915
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,870
the sweat every day for five months to 
make a film,

916
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,390
you know,
pulling the creative ideas,

917
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,590
pulling the hard work.
You know,

918
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:55,240
the,
the,

919
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,420
the grips and all the,
all the guys who are underpaid in or you

920
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,360
know,
working just to make money to feed their

921
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:03,550
families.
Uh,

922
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,130
so it's,
it's interesting because I saw it from a

923
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:10,010
very different Lens.
I saw it from my father's Lens,

924
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:10,930
which is,
you know,

925
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,920
my,
my dad show up on time,

926
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,510
get the movie done,
shoot a fast,

927
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,733
treat everybody good and you know,
work with the same people over and over 

928
00:38:18,591 --> 00:38:20,960
again.
You'll do the right thing by people have

929
00:38:20,961 --> 00:38:25,961
integrity,
whereas people don't see that side of,

930
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,640
of,
of the business.

931
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:30,510
There's so much other stuff that you 
never.

932
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,930
The people never get love for.
And in the film industry.

933
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,970
Yeah.
Well the long hours.

934
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,070
That's another thing that people don't

935
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,750
understand.
If you're on a film set,

936
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:42,010
like what's an average day for you?
It could be a short days of 12 hour day.

937
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,020
So it's 12 to 16.
And how many days a week you work in?

938
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:46,931
Five.
Six.

939
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:48,670
I mean,
when you're on location,

940
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,630
you're usually,
you can be in a movie that's doing a six

941
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:54,640
day work week or you could be doing a 
five day,

942
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:57,970
but by the end everyone's doing a six 
sometimes even,

943
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,440
you know,
you're just putting in full.

944
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,090
You're full throttle to get the movie 
done.

945
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,043
Now when you're on location,
do you have to squeeze a workout in to 

946
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:06,040
keep your brain?
Oh yeah,

947
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:06,931
yeah,
yeah,

948
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:09,010
yeah.
How do you do that in a 16 hour day?

949
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,540
I try to do it during lunch because I 
find that if you go to lunch,

950
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,713
you,
you get sluggish after lunch and then 

951
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,580
you're going,
oh shit,

952
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:21,040
I got to get back in there and do this.
I gotta now.

953
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:21,874
I gotta hit the coffee.
I get hit the whatever to get 

954
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:25,750
stimulated.
That's what you're saying.

955
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:32,460
Are you a math guy?
Or mostly just a bumpy get the history.

956
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,910
Um,
but yeah,

957
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:37,744
so I think working out during lunch it 
seems to be the best thing for me 

958
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:44,050
because I don't do well in the mornings 
for workout because I feel stiff.

959
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:48,070
So I like to get the blood going first.
If I could hit it during lunch,

960
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,670
uh,
even if I'm on set I'll do whatever,

961
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,311
dumbbells,
this,

962
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:53,080
that,
and the other and then I'll have,

963
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,720
I'll get some endorphins kicking.
Yeah.

964
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:58,270
I used to,
I used to do that too.

965
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,450
But now lately over the last,
like not even lately,

966
00:40:01,451 --> 00:40:03,940
but over the last like five or six years
I'd like to get up.

967
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:04,774
And the first thing I do work out,
especially like if I was doing Jujitsu 

968
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,200
in the afternoon and I needed to do a 
lifting session,

969
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,483
I want as much space between the lifting
and the Jujitsu is possible so I can 

970
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:16,510
recover.

971
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:20,110
So for me it's like just get up and even
though I don't feel good in the morning,

972
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,480
once the blood starts pumping and the 
sweat,

973
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,740
you got to just remind yourself like 
does A.

974
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,840
Yeah,
I know you feel like shit.

975
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,380
Just do the few reps get that blood 
going and then once,

976
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,170
once you're sweating you're sweating.
It's all the same,

977
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,300
you know?
Seems to be.

978
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,143
I do not do in the morning too.
And I worked out this morning and plus 

979
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:36,844
math,
but I just that that helps me feel the 

980
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:40,330
same.
So in the movie,

981
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,820
fast eight made a lot of sleeveless 
shirts,

982
00:40:42,821 --> 00:40:44,230
which I.
that's awesome.

983
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:46,990
You're a big fan of the other big fan.
That's why I slipped me a DM.

984
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,190
Stuff going on.
I'm sure about the connection.

985
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,680
He's confused right now.
I just know what we're talking about it.

986
00:40:56,681 --> 00:41:00,580
But he'll press on.
So do those guys.

987
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,460
So rock,
state them,

988
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:05,410
mother to do we have to do pushups in 
there to keep that pump for the,

989
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,120
for the scenes to.
Very good question.

990
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,860
Look everybody's.
I mean,

991
00:41:08,861 --> 00:41:10,560
I think everybody wants to be on the,
on the,

992
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,650
you know,
at the tip of the spear.

993
00:41:11,651 --> 00:41:13,570
Right?
And then you got shirt off,

994
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,770
tank off stuff.
So let's,

995
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,020
you know,
let's get the pump on.

996
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:19,150
That's where a guy like me,
I'm very,

997
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,220
very modest.
So if I was there,

998
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:24,200
I would be the opposite with your skin.
Tight muscle barriers.

999
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,410
I would try to slump maybe perhaps,
or hide my definition.

1000
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,820
One of the first thing I noticed when I 
walked out,

1001
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,381
I said,
oh,

1002
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:34,730
he's.
He really works on his posture.

1003
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,100
I do do a lot of yoga.
I do a lot of yoga.

1004
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,730
Very good posture.
You notice this cam,

1005
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,770
you don't even notice,
Bro.

1006
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,890
That wasn't even my friend.
Never commented on my posture.

1007
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:43,983
That was.
That was one of one of the first things 

1008
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:47,780
when I.
I guess I got to yoga about 10 years ago

1009
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,090
and it's changed my life.
It's amazing,

1010
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,410
right?
It changed my life.

1011
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,230
No pumping yoga.
There's no pump at yoga.

1012
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,073
We've just got to Kim,
like sleeveless shirts and getting this 

1013
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:01,510
pump on.
It doesn't like touching his toes and so

1014
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,980
that's a struggle I can do.
I can do this.

1015
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:05,110
So knees bent.
Yeah,

1016
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,533
but I think that's.
That was the one of the first thing a 

1017
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,210
guy told me when I was getting into it,
he said,

1018
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,010
you really got to work on your posture.

1019
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:13,910
He goes,
you're gonna.

1020
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,490
You know,
look at,

1021
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,590
look at guys who were,
you know,

1022
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,890
90 walking around on the street who are 
slumped over.

1023
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,810
He goes,
do you want to be like that?

1024
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,540
I mean it,
it Kinda got me quick.

1025
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,130
I was like,
settle the fuck down.

1026
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:27,100
I'm 31 years old.
How about you relaxed,

1027
00:42:27,101 --> 00:42:27,934
pow.
He's got such a better attitude because 

1028
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:30,764
I would've said worry about yourself,
but I'm used to getting critiqued on 

1029
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:37,880
line and so maybe I'm just a little 
defensive.

1030
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,153
Well these,
these seats that we're sitting in or 

1031
00:42:40,331 --> 00:42:42,950
that he's,
these are these called Ergo depot,

1032
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,410
uh,
is the name of the company and their,

1033
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,500
it's called a cup pisco.
And what it is,

1034
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:47,334
is they're comfortable but they make you
sort of sit and support yourself with 

1035
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:52,004
your spine.
Whereas a lot of times people just kind 

1036
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:54,410
of slump and chairs.

1037
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,320
Sure.
It's just terrible for your spine.

1038
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,340
Terrible.
Swamping is terrible.

1039
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:00,500
All that stuff's terrible.
And when you order,

1040
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:05,640
put in Rogan has order and save $10,
not a company sponsor.

1041
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,260
Jose,
are you plugging every companies?

1042
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,460
Coca Cola,
Pepsi,

1043
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,910
if you,
if you do do yoga though,

1044
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,120
like you will notice a difference in 
your posture and the like,

1045
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:20,660
the lack of like back aches and pains 
and stuff like that.

1046
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,710
Everything,
but it's just,

1047
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:25,670
it's hard for people because it's not 
necessarily fun,

1048
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:28,940
like the results are excellent,
but why you're there and you're sweating

1049
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:32,240
your dick off and you're stretching and 
you got to quiet your mind.

1050
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,103
That's.
I think that's the hardest thing for 

1051
00:43:34,401 --> 00:43:34,941
people,
right?

1052
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:35,700
Is,
is,

1053
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,533
is that the meditation aspect of it is 
so it's so hard for people to go to get 

1054
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:43,160
out of their own way,
but once you do it for awhile,

1055
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,260
you realize you're like,
now I crave it.

1056
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,690
I can't go.
I can't go a few days without.

1057
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,390
I go,
I start getting antsy and I go,

1058
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,660
I gotTa Kinda Yoga,
you know?

1059
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,870
Yeah.
It's also a very pretentious thing.

1060
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,670
Not really,
but it sounds like it is like,

1061
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,080
I'm going to do yoga.
I'm better than you do yoga.

1062
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,860
Then I'm going to have hummus,
you know,

1063
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:01,490
like,
Oh,

1064
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:02,600
I hate this guy.
Well,

1065
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:05,360
you know what the thing was when I 
started 10 years ago,

1066
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,650
a buddy brought me in.
It was 98 percent female.

1067
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:14,000
Now I've noticed it's a 50 slash 50.
You got to go to a different class.

1068
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,083
Reason not to go.
What if there's a guy in front of you 

1069
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:20,350
and as you've both been Dover's of guy 
sack,

1070
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,740
like that's not what I'm trying to say 
is I think that it was for,

1071
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,790
for a long time it was state.
Yeah,

1072
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:26,893
frowned upon,
right?

1073
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,290
For men to go to yoga and I know I even 
had those thoughts.

1074
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:31,124
I was saying,
well,

1075
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:31,891
you know,
Yoga,

1076
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:31,980
I

1077
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,160
want to go hit the gym and get,
you know,

1078
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:35,100
get a pump on Jack,
get checked.

1079
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,120
But now I'm going,
well,

1080
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:38,963
you know,
you see all the benefits and everything 

1081
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,000
to incorporate that with,
uh,

1082
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,830
with the pump.
For Jujitsu,

1083
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:44,664
it's huge because range of motion is one
of the most important things that you 

1084
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:50,070
Jitsu and flexibility,
especially when you have a good guard.

1085
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,660
And I got into yoga for the most part 
because of Hickson,

1086
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,770
Hickson,
gracie.

1087
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:01,130
And I remember in 1994 I saw a video of 
Hixon gracie doing yoga.

1088
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:02,610
And I was like,
oh,

1089
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,653
because I was like,
everybody would always say that Hickson 

1090
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:05,664
was like,
there was all these great gracie family 

1091
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:08,700
members.
Hands was great,

1092
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:11,160
high end was great.
All these guys were great health,

1093
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,880
but Hickson was always thought to be 
number one and I was like,

1094
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:15,743
well why?
Why is he so much better than everybody 

1095
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:17,480
else?

1096
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,810
And then I realized,
oh,

1097
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,910
he's got like the full package like he 
has.

1098
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:21,923
His Dad is Helio Gracie,
so his dad was like one of the 

1099
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:27,420
originators of Brazilian Jujitsu.
So he grew up with it.

1100
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:30,780
It's in his DNA.
He trained his whole life under the best

1101
00:45:30,781 --> 00:45:31,614
teachers in the world.
And then yoga in training and exercise 

1102
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:35,694
like Hixon does balance beams,
which stands on a balance beam and does 

1103
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:39,294
a full split.
Standing up holds his foot over his 

1104
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:43,620
head.
I mean it's fucking freaky to watch.

1105
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:45,810
He's just got incredible control of his 
body.

1106
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:46,883
So the dexterity and the control of the 
body along with the strength and 

1107
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,640
Jujitsu.
Like that's what made Hickson who is,

1108
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,770
you know,
I'm sure it's just,

1109
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,450
it's again,
it's one of those things,

1110
00:45:57,451 --> 00:46:00,270
it's not as cool as telling someone you 
dead lift 600 pounds,

1111
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,593
you know,
either what are you doing to deadlift 

1112
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,750
and 600,
five,

1113
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:04,370
six,
zero,

1114
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,203
five three.

1115
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,390
Yeah,
put chains on it.

1116
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,500
Cause it's not hard enough,
that kind of stuff is going to,

1117
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,820
that's going to catch up at the end,
at the end of your life,

1118
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:15,380
you know,
that's,

1119
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,750
that's tough.
You know,

1120
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:18,300
it's,
if you're not careful,

1121
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:22,950
you too much of that.
I feel like it's really going to cause a

1122
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:25,350
lot of pain in your later life.
It can,

1123
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,270
but man,
if you just do yoga,

1124
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:29,010
you look like a,
like a month course.

1125
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,800
No,
you've got to get jacked as well.

1126
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,420
That's a little bit.
I don't know.

1127
00:46:34,421 --> 00:46:35,580
I mean depends on what you're trying to 
do.

1128
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,940
But I agree with you that it does give 
you a calming thing.

1129
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,830
Charms you down or away.
Yeah.

1130
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:44,670
And I think there's Hixon look at that 
picture of him on the beach,

1131
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,830
you know,
I can't do that.

1132
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,990
Oh,
he's unbelievably flexible.

1133
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:49,920
You've got to get into it.

1134
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,240
You got to do it.
Yeah.

1135
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,083
I mean Hixon mean there's just not a 
whole lot of human beings that I can do 

1136
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:56,004
that.
But forget about like world class black 

1137
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:58,600
belt.
Yeah.

1138
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,970
Yeah.
He's a frequent combination.

1139
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,360
Okay.
Wait,

1140
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,670
so I got to go back to the fanboy stuff,
so I just want to ask.

1141
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:07,983
So.
So you started off acting with like 

1142
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,580
smaller movies,
right?

1143
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,090
Sure.
Then now you've been.

1144
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,490
And tell me if I'm,
I know you were in fury.

1145
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:18,703
Yeah,
I didn't remember until that's started 

1146
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,030
to know who you were.
This fury fury was with Brad Pitt.

1147
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,500
Right?
Which one was a world war?

1148
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,910
David Air.
Oh,

1149
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:28,110
that's right.
Yeah.

1150
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,070
And then now feels like you've,
now

1151
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,870
you're in the,
the big movies.

1152
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:34,480
Well look,
I started 14,

1153
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:37,240
15,
almost 15 years ago now doing it.

1154
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,173
It's hysterical.
And people first SORTA got a couple of 

1155
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,090
movies happening overnight.
Success.

1156
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,680
I know.
It's not always.

1157
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,740
What the fuck you talking about?
I've been at it for 10 years,

1158
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:48,574
you know,
at that point.

1159
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,280
Um,
but yeah,

1160
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:50,870
I started.
Yeah,

1161
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,530
doing a tiny one liners,
you know,

1162
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:58,030
any chance I got just to,
just to get onset a play.

1163
00:47:58,031 --> 00:47:58,660
Any,
any,

1164
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,010
any role,
do any lines,

1165
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:01,000
whatever.
Just learned,

1166
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:02,530
soak it up.
And um,

1167
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,910
yeah,
I was doing that for years.

1168
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:05,230
I mean,
I was doing that for seven,

1169
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:06,940
eight years,
you know,

1170
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:09,700
Allah was bartending a while.
I was,

1171
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,200
you know,
valet parking cars,

1172
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,940
anything to,
you know,

1173
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:14,403
pay the bills.
Right.

1174
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,303
How important is that that you actually 
worked your way through it even though 

1175
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:18,120
your Clint Eastwood son?

1176
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,073
Right.
That's what I was interested in is that 

1177
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,830
it didn't feel like he helped use and I 
don't know,

1178
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:24,664
maybe he did,
but.

1179
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:25,630
No,
no,

1180
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:26,381
have you?
Anyone who knows,

1181
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:28,680
my dad would just laugh at it.
They,

1182
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,310
you know,
they're,

1183
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:30,400
they would say,
oh yeah,

1184
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:33,230
I mean my dad is very old school and 
he's,

1185
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,870
he's very,
very tough on his sons.

1186
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,760
He has an older brother,
um,

1187
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:38,823
and it's,
it just doesn't happen like that in our 

1188
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:41,020
family.
Uh,

1189
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:43,240
there's no handouts and you want 
something,

1190
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:44,103
you got to go get it.
And I can't thank him enough for that 

1191
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:50,290
because it never gave me any,
a backup,

1192
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:50,550
a,
it,

1193
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,383
it,
it didn't,

1194
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,700
it didn't make me go well and I can just
sort of sit around or you know,

1195
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,000
it created drive,
created,

1196
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,880
you know,
hard work and driving.

1197
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:03,670
Those are all the things that take to 
make somebody successful yet like if you

1198
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:07,150
were 22 and he made you a star of his 
big movie,

1199
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:08,900
that would been something that would've 
looked.

1200
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,660
It would've looked.
It looked really bad on him.

1201
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,950
Yeah.
It was so and yeah.

1202
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,100
I mean he could do that I guess when in 
his movie,

1203
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,590
but I think the common thing is,
well you had,

1204
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:19,240
you know,
had it easy because you know,

1205
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:20,074
somebody,
he can't just pick up a phone and call 

1206
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,250
some big director and tell him who he 
should cast.

1207
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:26,120
And if he did it would be a mess.
Yeah.

1208
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,420
I mean for the director probably tell 
him,

1209
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,070
you know,
thank you clint.

1210
00:49:30,071 --> 00:49:31,140
But uh,
I keep not,

1211
00:49:31,141 --> 00:49:32,600
not doing that,
you know,

1212
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:36,040
it was my movie and I don't even know 
who your son is when he went,

1213
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,010
when he went on TV and did that like 
thing where he had a,

1214
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,770
a s like a seat next to him and talked.
You talked to the empty chair.

1215
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:46,330
We did.
You call them up and dad go,

1216
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:47,710
what the fuck,
Dad,

1217
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,180
what are you doing?
No,

1218
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,240
I stay out of politics.
I don't even,

1219
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,380
I don't,
I don't give two shits about politics.

1220
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:54,830
I,
that wasn't even politics.

1221
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,650
I was just like a play and he was like 
a,

1222
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:00,280
like a puppet show with no puppet.
Yeah,

1223
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,430
I did like the intent though because I 
hate,

1224
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:04,720
well,
whatever.

1225
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,980
Yeah,
it was good with it.

1226
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,873
I get it.

1227
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,240
But a straight Ho tongue and pen.
Hey,

1228
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:18,100
didn't you try out or I'll let her know 
how to but didn't audition this my wheel

1229
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,370
wheelhouse.
But for American sniper I did.

1230
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,600
And that was his,
that was his movie,

1231
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:26,240
right?
That was.

1232
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,860
So how'd go,
what happened?

1233
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,780
Uh,
yeah,

1234
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,470
I,
you know,

1235
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:30,303
I auditioned and I remember actually 
talking to I new Bradley Cooper and I 

1236
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:34,071
said,
hey,

1237
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:35,420
you know what,
I love to play your Bra.

1238
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,410
I'd read the script,
I read the script and you know,

1239
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,870
I was already doing my own thing at this
point.

1240
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:39,704
I was working for a long time,
but I go in periodically and audition 

1241
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:44,020
for his films.
Uh,

1242
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:47,870
because there clint eastwood films get 
an opportunity to audition.

1243
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:48,990
Great.
And,

1244
00:50:48,991 --> 00:50:49,824
and you know,
when I said that I loved to play your 

1245
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:52,630
brother and interesting,
you know,

1246
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,920
one of those roles and he proudly kind 
of looked at me like,

1247
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,230
eh,
I don't know,

1248
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:56,510
maybe.

1249
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:57,320
Okay,
cool.

1250
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,180
Kind of brush it out with her.
I was friends with them.

1251
00:50:59,420 --> 00:50:59,961
And then,
so,

1252
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:01,430
you know,
I sort of said,

1253
00:51:01,431 --> 00:51:02,264
hey,
can I get an audition to go edition for 

1254
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:05,474
this,
uh,

1255
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,180
through my dad's company.
And so I went and put myself on tape.

1256
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,253
Uh,
it's pretty simple when you go audition 

1257
00:51:10,521 --> 00:51:11,510
for him.
He's not,

1258
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,130
he's not there,
no one's there anything.

1259
00:51:13,131 --> 00:51:15,500
You just go put yourself on tape with a 
casting director.

1260
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,490
Okay.
And then,

1261
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:16,881
uh,
you know,

1262
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:18,890
either either hear something back or you
don't.

1263
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,060
Yeah.
And that's sort of the,

1264
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,940
that's the end of it.
And a lot of times you'll never do.

1265
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:23,331
I mean,
that's,

1266
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:24,850
that's how it goes for actors.
Yeah.

1267
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,310
So that's what happened with that.
You,

1268
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,550
you put it on tape and then didn't hear 
back,

1269
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,413
you know?
No.

1270
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:32,030
You didn't say what dad would say.
Oh,

1271
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,390
it didn't work like that in my family.
Really Nice.

1272
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:35,263
He's too old school.
I would never even dare to bring up 

1273
00:51:36,171 --> 00:51:38,350
something like that back to.
Yeah,

1274
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,193
that's.
I mean,

1275
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:42,290
that's probably why you're so normal.
Me.

1276
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,193
Yeah.
Because those people that are in those 

1277
00:51:44,591 --> 00:51:47,740
sheltered families where he's not good,
it's not good.

1278
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,753
It's not good for you.

1279
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:49,683
No it,
you know,

1280
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,570
you don't have the value for a dollar.
The value for hard work,

1281
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:55,020
you don't have.
Everything becomes

1282
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,890
blurred.
Yeah.

1283
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:00,720
I think that's the same way with 
inheritance.

1284
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,980
I mean it's very rare that someone 
inherits a shitload of money early on in

1285
00:52:04,981 --> 00:52:07,500
life and then winds up having character 
and being.

1286
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:10,650
They say that Donald trump is like that,
that he's a cool guy.

1287
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,860
Like everybody I know that's met him.
I know he gets a lot of weird press,

1288
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:14,963
but the guys that I know that know him 
say he's a really nice guy really down 

1289
00:52:18,121 --> 00:52:19,350
to earth,
really normal,

1290
00:52:19,351 --> 00:52:22,140
really healthy and I've heard that.
I bought a lot of trump's kids,

1291
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,080
which is really strange because he like,
he's this crazy,

1292
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:25,980
you know,
I'm the best.

1293
00:52:25,981 --> 00:52:27,990
I do the best things,
my ratings of the best.

1294
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:31,710
But you would think that he would be 
like this Dickie Dad,

1295
00:52:31,711 --> 00:52:33,990
but apparently he's done a great job as 
a dad,

1296
00:52:33,991 --> 00:52:34,824
which is very strange.
But that's what I hear about Donald 

1297
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,000
Trump Jr.
Yeah,

1298
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,930
that's,
I've heard that too.

1299
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,990
And he so he does got to be cool.
She's got that goal.

1300
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,570
MaYbe that's why he's cool.
I mean maybe that's probably it.

1301
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:47,730
I mean it might have something to do 
with it for real.

1302
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,550
It just,
all those experiences in the wild.

1303
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,271
Well,
no,

1304
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:53,280
and we just today,
so we've shot a lot of.

1305
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,680
I mean I've been doing this for 30 
years.

1306
00:52:55,681 --> 00:52:59,460
You've been doing this for years now and
still it's so humbling.

1307
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:00,780
Yeah,
there's,

1308
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,480
you know,
It's not easy making a good shot.

1309
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,373
Yeah.
Every now and then one goes right into 

1310
00:53:05,221 --> 00:53:07,200
the neck of the target and you're like,
what the fuck?

1311
00:53:07,201 --> 00:53:11,490
I've been doing this all day one just 
goes wrong.

1312
00:53:11,491 --> 00:53:12,324
You talk about ego checks.
I meAn anytime you think you're good at 

1313
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,450
archery for sure.
There's a,

1314
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,890
there's a wake up call.
Yeah.

1315
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:21,600
I mean it is not easy.
It's not an easy thing to do.

1316
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,540
And then also it's like waiting,
waiting,

1317
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:25,710
waiting,
waiting,

1318
00:53:25,711 --> 00:53:26,461
waiting,
stocking,

1319
00:53:26,461 --> 00:53:27,330
stocking,
stocking.

1320
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,880
And then all of a sudden here comes a 
time.

1321
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:30,690
Ready,
get ready,

1322
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,550
pull shot.
Now is it really happening?

1323
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:33,384
Is it really?
And then you have to execute a great 

1324
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:35,934
shot under this insane.
The adrenaline is pumping and you have 

1325
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:41,040
you done bowhunting yet yet?
What have you bow hunted deer.

1326
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,470
Have you been successful?
Have,

1327
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,060
that's a nice thing,
huh?

1328
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,600
Yeah.
Well what kind of blacktail?

1329
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:49,110
What'd you went to?
California.

1330
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:49,980
Oh,
okay.

1331
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,180
Um,
and it'S,

1332
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,400
it is like very.
It's very,

1333
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:54,750
uh,
like you said,

1334
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:55,584
it's totally in the pocket.
All of a sudden it's now an adrenaline 

1335
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:01,770
adrenaline and then you're,
you know,

1336
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,610
it's over because either missed the shot
are you,

1337
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,230
you know,
you,

1338
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,150
you didn't take it.
And you're like,

1339
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,650
you know what they say cam,
that there's a direct corelation between

1340
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:15,450
lower heart rate and good archery that 
there's actually been studies done,

1341
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:16,110
you know,
like in,

1342
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:18,750
in these european circles where their 
target archers.

1343
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,210
And one of the things that they've found
to improve.

1344
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,370
Dudley was talking about this on his 
podcast,

1345
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,140
knock on,
on his podcast.

1346
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:25,974
He was talking about that running in 
particular is really good at lowering 

1347
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:35,760
your heart rate obviously,
but then also the side effect of that is

1348
00:54:35,761 --> 00:54:36,594
it iMproves archery and improves your 
ability under pressure to keep your 

1349
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:42,270
heart rate down because your heart ways 
naturally lower.

1350
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:43,051
Right.
You know,

1351
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:43,884
like your,
your resting heart rate's got to be 

1352
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:45,750
stupid law.
Like what is it?

1353
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:46,950
I don't know.
Forties,

1354
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:48,323
forties.
Wow.

1355
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,313
yeah.
So I thought mine was good in the 55 or 

1356
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:52,230
something.
That's crazy.

1357
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,630
Yeah.
You know what michael bisping's is 34.

1358
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:55,950
Yeah,
she Is.

1359
00:54:55,951 --> 00:54:56,784
Yeah.
Nor most good marathon runners or low 

1360
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:01,750
forties,
you know,

1361
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,330
upper thirties.
Yeah.

1362
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,313
So when you have that going for you,
like say if your heart rate gets jacked 

1363
00:55:07,951 --> 00:55:08,784
up and you calm it down,
you're probably still going to be like 

1364
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:12,570
within the sixties or seventies.

1365
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:13,703
Whereas a guy who's like some fucking 
baba with some big sloppy gut and you 

1366
00:55:17,701 --> 00:55:18,534
know,
and he's taken rip fuel just so he can 

1367
00:55:20,431 --> 00:55:21,264
get up to the top of the mountain when 
he gets up there and see some of these 

1368
00:55:23,341 --> 00:55:25,770
book,
he's tired,

1369
00:55:25,771 --> 00:55:26,604
he's winded.
His heart rates already jacked and it's 

1370
00:55:28,831 --> 00:55:31,560
harder to execute a good shot and under 
those conditions.

1371
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,473
Yeah,
and I mean just like with running and 

1372
00:55:33,661 --> 00:55:34,494
exercising,
you recover faster the better shape 

1373
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:36,640
you're in.
So yeah,

1374
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,730
that's kind of why,
I mean it can go,

1375
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,370
it can peak,
but then it's back low,

1376
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,204
normal and then you're more composed.
So I mean it takes a while for those 

1377
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:45,924
guys to recover if they're not in shape.
After all my years of exercIsing have 

1378
00:55:50,641 --> 00:55:53,040
just started running,
running.

1379
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,110
We're running today.
We're running the trails today.

1380
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,140
After this I'm going to keep.
I'm trying to keep up with him.

1381
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,710
Ridiculous.
It's crazy for me buddy.

1382
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,110
Doing jujitsu with hixon.
You know you're going to get killed.

1383
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,140
Just go out there and do it.
Don't be a pussy.

1384
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,590
How many miles are you going to do 
today?

1385
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,530
I'll probably 20 or 30 if he can make 
that.

1386
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,650
Just kidding.
You're kidding.

1387
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:13,560
Scott.
Weird.

1388
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,840
Choose honestly.
Sears.

1389
00:56:14,841 --> 00:56:17,520
Addy,
if you're training for the 230,

1390
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:19,720
how many do you do a day?
Well,

1391
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,210
you can do a marathon everyday,
right?

1392
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,000
You'd kill yourself.
He was doing a half marathon every day.

1393
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,213
At least

1394
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,200
you know there's,
there's days or.

1395
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:27,034
I mean there's weeks getting ready for 
the big foot that I had ran 130 140 

1396
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:31,474
miles,
so that's almost 20 miles a day in the 

1397
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:36,250
big foot is 200.
five miles over.

1398
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:37,061
Said.
What'd you do?

1399
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,550
Seventy eight hours.
Seventy eight.

1400
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:40,480
Fifty six.
Did you see that?

1401
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:44,590
A ultra marathon guy who finished six 
seconds passed the deadline.

1402
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,560
Oh,
barcelona at the barkley marathon.

1403
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:48,790
Yeah,
he fucked up.

1404
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,300
I took a detour.
Now I know that that race,

1405
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,870
they've been sending me messages and 
they tagged.

1406
00:56:56,170 --> 00:57:00,340
I don't know if it was both of us,
but the other day on or did a tweet.

1407
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,713
Somebody mentioned my name for it and so
the race actually tweeted and said that 

1408
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,240
I wouldn't be able to finish because I'd
be.

1409
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,583
I'd want to get up in a tree stand and 
kill some of the wild pigs running 

1410
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:11,950
around,
so it'd be.

1411
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:13,840
Yeah,
I apparently I didn't know this,

1412
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:14,853
but.
So that barkley marathon itself tweeted 

1413
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:18,910
that.
Is it Tennessee?

1414
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:22,420
Oh yeah.
That's the place is infested apparently.

1415
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:23,381
Yeah,
Tennessee.

1416
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:25,060
So it's a.
And I got.

1417
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,953
There's a whole story behind it.
I wish I knew it because I'm going to 

1418
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:28,534
sound stupid,
but there's a prison there and I can't 

1419
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:31,594
remember who was in the prison.
Some famous criminal killed somebody or 

1420
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:37,300
tried to kill somebody.
Anyway,

1421
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:41,870
escaped and he made it a was out for 55 
hours,

1422
00:57:41,871 --> 00:57:45,070
something like that.
Made it just eight miles in and they got

1423
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:45,904
them.
So that's kind of how the race 

1424
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:49,090
originated.
There's a story behind it.

1425
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:51,070
So the race is there around that prison 
in that,

1426
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:51,983
in that same country.
And so the goal of the time limit is 

1427
00:57:55,631 --> 00:58:00,550
something around that 55 hours and you 
have five loops.

1428
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,130
You go one one way,
a first loop,

1429
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:04,540
opposite,
opposite,

1430
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:05,860
opposite,
and you have.

1431
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:09,580
And the course isn't marked.
So you're navigating with a map that you

1432
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:13,460
have to create yourself and to get the 
checkpoints.

1433
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:14,403
There's books there at every checkpoint 
and you have a certain number of the 

1434
00:58:17,531 --> 00:58:22,090
page and they say you go and pull out 
page 12 of every book,

1435
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,013
this is how it works.
And then you bring it back to make sure 

1436
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,220
they check you when you get the lap 
completed inside.

1437
00:58:27,221 --> 00:58:27,910
Okay.
You,

1438
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:28,743
he hit every checkpoint.
Here's all the pages of those books and 

1439
00:58:31,031 --> 00:58:34,930
then you do another lap.
And what if you run with some douche bag

1440
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:36,130
who's like,
fuck,

1441
00:58:36,131 --> 00:58:39,250
page three,
I'm pulling his page to page seven.

1442
00:58:39,251 --> 00:58:40,520
Could suck my ass.
Yeah.

1443
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:43,360
Started pulling people's pages out.
I don't,

1444
00:58:43,361 --> 00:58:44,194
I,
you know,

1445
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:45,183
there's,
there's honor in if somebody's working 

1446
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:49,690
that hard,
usually don't have to worry.

1447
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,320
They respect other people working at 
heart,

1448
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,120
you know what I mean?

1449
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,430
It's just kind of the thing.
Yeah,

1450
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:56,140
the honor system,
they had the culture of it.

1451
00:58:56,141 --> 00:58:56,974
Yeah.
So I mean I wouldn't worry about 

1452
00:58:58,241 --> 00:59:00,280
something like that,
but it sounds like a brutal race.

1453
00:59:00,281 --> 00:59:01,114
I think only me,
it might be up to 15 people now have 

1454
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:08,890
completed it in 25 years.
Whoa.

1455
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,280
It's tough.
And this guy missed it by six seconds.

1456
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:13,114
Yeah.
Jesus christ because he fucked up and 

1457
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:17,110
made a,
an error in his past.

1458
00:59:17,111 --> 00:59:19,600
Something happened and I can't,
I don't,

1459
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,040
I didn't read the whole story.
But.

1460
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,560
So you have to do it inside a 60 hours.
Is that what he doesn't like that?

1461
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,530
Yeah.
And she was like 60 hours in six seconds

1462
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:29,120
or something like that.
It says he,

1463
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:30,640
uh,
when he was going around the race,

1464
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,483
you've found that you came to a 
staircase and there's no staircases in 

1465
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:35,930
the marathon.
So kneW doing fucked up then.

1466
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,630
Oh boy.
He was a super sleep deprived.

1467
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:39,560
You know,
he made a wrong turn.

1468
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:41,690
You're two miles from the end of the 
race.

1469
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:43,070
Yeah.
Wow.

1470
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:45,650
And there's no.
There's no course.

1471
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,500
So you just run into the woods.
Yeah.

1472
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:52,220
Jesus christ,
they have the map up there,

1473
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,054
the topo map up there.
And you create your own map off of that 

1474
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:58,820
map and you can't use a map.
You can't use a phone,

1475
00:59:58,821 --> 00:59:59,654
you can't use a gps.
So there's navigating is part of the 

1476
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:04,820
same when you're doing it.
I want to do it.

1477
01:00:04,821 --> 01:00:09,700
I know you do.
You had to get entered is that,

1478
01:00:09,701 --> 01:00:10,534
that's a whole process in itself.
You have to sit and like a letter and a 

1479
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:15,583
dollar 47,
something like that into the race 

1480
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:18,614
director and they,
they select who they want in there and 

1481
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:22,610
then you have to bring a license plate 
from your house,

1482
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:27,670
from your home state and like a shirt to
the guy and then you're in.

1483
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:29,990
Wow.
So it's,

1484
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:30,860
there's,
I mean,

1485
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,580
a lot of crazy.
I dunno,

1486
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,110
it's kinda,
it's just bringing a mature.

1487
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:36,530
Can you give them a keep hammering 
shirt?

1488
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:39,950
I don't have to be a specific training.
I think he chooses.

1489
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:40,963
I dunno,
I,

1490
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,833
I need to.
I watched a documentary but I don't 

1491
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,264
remember every detail.
Are you doing some really nutty one 

1492
01:00:46,611 --> 01:00:47,870
soon?
Uh,

1493
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:51,260
well I need to talk to,
to a candice about it,

1494
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:53,750
the race director of the bigfoot she's 
putting on,

1495
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:55,830
um,
the moab a,

1496
01:00:55,831 --> 01:00:59,150
it's a to 234 mile race.
This will be the first one.

1497
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,010
It's a low longest one.
There is.

1498
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:04,420
So you're going to do what you did the 
big foot 200,

1499
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:09,380
which is 205 miles and then.
And then do another 29 miles.

1500
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,390
Yeah,
that's ridiculous.

1501
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:13,310
that's what I need to run a buyer.
I mean we,

1502
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,870
it was successful last time.

1503
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:18,480
We got a lot of people followed along,
whIch is what,

1504
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:20,240
what we wanted,
you know,

1505
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:21,590
because you were running.
Yeah.

1506
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,453
Yeah.
I'm with the live tracking and It was 

1507
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:25,544
cool because that race is so special.
She's so special as far as her passion 

1508
01:01:30,621 --> 01:01:33,770
for this and,
and I'm creating these opportunities for

1509
01:01:33,771 --> 01:01:36,470
people to really test themselves.
And she was on your podcast?

1510
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

1511
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,900
I'm a big fan of hers.
What's her last name?

1512
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:39,763
Candice.
Burt.

1513
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,770
And the key premarin number.
What would,

1514
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,630
do you remember which number was a no or
five?

1515
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,980
Was it?
I'm not sure people will find it.

1516
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,671
Yeah.
No,

1517
01:01:46,671 --> 01:01:48,830
it was good though because she's super,
super cool.

1518
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,460
And so she's putting on this new one in 
moab and it's,

1519
01:01:52,461 --> 01:01:54,800
you know,
further than any other race.

1520
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,860
And so I want to do it,
but there it is.

1521
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:59,720
race number three.
Moab 200.

1522
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,570
yep.
Why do they call them 222 to 34?

1523
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:03,980
I don't know.
That's what I like.

1524
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:06,060
The big foot thing called big foot two.
Oh five.

1525
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,580
Goddammit.
Two hundred.

1526
01:02:07,581 --> 01:02:08,414
Five pounds.
Like I'd feel like thirtY four miles is 

1527
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:14,030
a little too far just to round down.
That's a weird number.

1528
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,830
I mean,
I mean let's do the.

1529
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,370
How about the moab 50?
That's closer.

1530
01:02:20,371 --> 01:02:22,350
If you're going to run on that.
I like that better.

1531
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:23,223
Sounds better.
Just the 234 point three and p if you 

1532
01:02:26,401 --> 01:02:29,310
run 234 miles an extra 16 probably just 
like,

1533
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:31,590
who cares?
I'm already dead.

1534
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:35,570
It's a long way.
It was looking at that country.

1535
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,530
Doesn't that look beautiful?
Does.

1536
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,690
But it's going to be in july,
isn't it now?

1537
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:41,850
Now october.
Oh okay.

1538
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,520
So that's not bad.
You'll be fairly cool.

1539
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,770
Now you were saying that when you do one
of these things,

1540
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:51,600
you don't sleep like you slept maybe an 
hour a couple of times.

1541
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,400
Yeah.
And that's how,

1542
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:58,320
you know if you want to win.
I'm the guy who won richard total beast.

1543
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,590
I'm always asking how long because my 
goal was to win,

1544
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:02,040
you know,
I,

1545
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,590
I didn't achieve my goal.
My goal was to.

1546
01:03:04,591 --> 01:03:07,890
I wanted to get the fastest ever.
So I came up short on that.

1547
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,470
but what place did you place?
I finished eighth.

1548
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,113
Yeah.
So I was winning through 62 miles I 

1549
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:16,950
think.
And richard passed me.

1550
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:18,143
fuck richard.

1551
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:21,700
He's a star.
But uh,

1552
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,830
I was asking,
I'm like,

1553
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,110
how long had he been sleeping,
you know,

1554
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,570
at these checkpoints.
And they said 15 minutes.

1555
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:28,463
I'm like,
what?

1556
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:29,813
So I have like,
so I decided I wasn't going to sleep 

1557
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:34,980
until I got 100 miles down.
I wanted to get at least halfway done.

1558
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:39,510
So it got to 100,
slept for about an hour and got up.

1559
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,890
And then I ended up sleeping for three 
hours total over the 78 hours.

1560
01:03:43,891 --> 01:03:46,340
So you sleep about an hour a day if you 
want to.

1561
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:47,183
If your hope is to compete,
to win or to a place highlight like I 

1562
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:53,130
wanted to.
You can't sleep.

1563
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,780
You don't have any interest in doing 
that?

1564
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:55,540
No,
no,

1565
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,373
no.
Yesterday I said absolutely no fucking 

1566
01:03:58,650 --> 01:03:59,920
way.
Yeah,

1567
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,360
we're kind of.
Yeah,

1568
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,010
it's just,
you know,

1569
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:06,923
it's just like,
it's a different type of test just to 

1570
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:10,920
see what you're capable of.

1571
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,143
Yeah,
I get it.

1572
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,520
I get it.
I guess I'm just not that into running.

1573
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:16,470
Do you run it all?
Uh,

1574
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:19,320
like this morning I ran the treadmill 
before I hit the weights,

1575
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,800
but just a warm up because there was 
nothing in the gym I was at,

1576
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:26,050
but not really.
He can go with us later.

1577
01:04:26,051 --> 01:04:27,490
Yeah,
I'll come with you guys run.

1578
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,930
It was run to conan.
Can we run to um,

1579
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:35,190
a breathing break?
Dust or terrible shit.

1580
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:36,403
All that crap.
I saY we run there and then shoot bows 

1581
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:42,690
there.
But this is what we really concentrating

1582
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:44,550
on.
Isn't he like 10 foot tall?

1583
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,520
He's a big tall guy.
Six seven are super nice guy.

1584
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:48,413
Is he?
Yeah.

1585
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,530
Yeah.
Very nice guy.

1586
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,960
Yeah.
You went when somebody was on his show,

1587
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:53,880
you went with them,
right?

1588
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,350
Sturgill simpson.
Yeah,

1589
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,070

1590
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:56,903
yeah.
I went and hang out with them down 

1591
01:04:57,511 --> 01:04:58,290
there,
didn't he?

1592
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:00,840
He won a grammy this year.
You won a grammy?

1593
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:01,860
Yeah.
That's awesome.

1594
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,173
He's a.
He's another guy that's like a super 

1595
01:05:05,161 --> 01:05:05,994
famous super successful guy that you 
would never know if you met him just as 

1596
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:10,430
normal as they get.
Yeah.

1597
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,273
He fucking working on a railroad car.
Like he was working for a train company 

1598
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:18,100
just like a

1599
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:21,850
couple of years before he made it.
His wife talked him into doing music.

1600
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:22,511
She was like,
you know,

1601
01:05:22,511 --> 01:05:24,040
you don't suck at this.
Well,

1602
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:26,200
that's what shocked me about when I met 
cameron.

1603
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,450
We were,
it came out in the conversation.

1604
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:33,750
He's still working for a utility utility
companies that you're trying to get them

1605
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:37,470

a professional hunter and,

1606

1607
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:40,810

What do you mean?

1608
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:41,890
And he's like,

They've got all sorts of access,

1616
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:01,780

1624
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:16,180
My friend remy warren's going to be down

I'll see if we can make something 

1627
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:25,384
happen.
I'll see if we can make something 

1628
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:26,830
happen.
I'll find out what's going on.

1629
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:27,664
But apparently a lanai in particular.
Well they say maui remy warren just got 

1630
01:06:32,111 --> 01:06:34,630
back from maui.
So now we're on the south side.

1631
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:35,860
Yeah,
they've got a lot down there.

1632
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,210
So have you hunted there too?
No,

1633
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:41,740
we never get a chance.
Have you hunted in south here?

1634
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:46,370
Mostly in the southern California area.
But uh,

1635
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:50,460
when you were hunting we still hunting 
spot and stalk like,

1636
01:06:50,461 --> 01:06:51,294
whoa,
what are you doing?

1637
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,233
No,
just stand and just knowing the areas 

1638
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:55,331
with,
with a,

1639
01:06:55,331 --> 01:06:56,164
you know,
a friend who knew the areas and walking 

1640
01:06:58,090 --> 01:06:58,923
and you know,
a flushing them out and you were doing 

1641
01:07:01,691 --> 01:07:02,524
it with that rostow by laughing.
It's not that he's just a little bit 

1642
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:11,220
self conscious about the roth man.
That thing.

1643
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:14,440
That thing was a good.
Hey it killed a deer apparently.

1644
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:16,960
Yeah.
So well now that you have a hoyt though.

1645
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,120
Yeah,
that things like the most balance.

1646
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:22,480
I mean you feel immediately there.
So there's new ones are so good.

1647
01:07:22,481 --> 01:07:23,314
It's so crazy because the first one cam 
ever got me was only four years ago and 

1648
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,240
you think like wow,
that's,

1649
01:07:28,450 --> 01:07:29,283
you know,
that's pretty recent but it was awesome 

1650
01:07:31,271 --> 01:07:31,840
at the time.

1651
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:32,673
But if you had to go back to it today 
and be like oh this piece of shit like 

1652
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:37,060
this,
but not really.

1653
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:37,894
But both technology just keeps 
increasing every year they get a little 

1654
01:07:41,321 --> 01:07:42,310
better,
a little bit better.

1655
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,280
Little bit better.
Yeah,

1656
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,410
sure.
And you might not know.

1657
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,750
I mean,
cause I always say it's like,

1658
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:48,100
oh,
I don't,

1659
01:07:48,101 --> 01:07:49,990
I try not to be the guy who's like,
oh,

1660
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:50,824
this is the best thing I've ever shot,
but it's slightly better and as we know 

1661
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:58,240
and hunting that,
that there's a fine line between success

1662
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,310
and failure.
So that's slightly better.

1663
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:02,440
Might be the difference,
you know,

1664
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,910
a lot more an amateur and comparison and
I don't want to beat him.

1665
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:08,050
I did it out,
shoot him.

1666
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,700
He did yesterday.
He made a couple of times.

1667
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,990
It's like you're taking the liberty to 
remember.

1668
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:15,383
Remember a.

1669
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,633
That is the beautiful thing about 
archery is that there really is no 

1670
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:23,040
perfection in archery.
I mean,

1671
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:24,043
you can get a perfect shot,
but to be perfect every time you shoot 

1672
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:31,520
is never been done really well.
I will say by the end of the day we were

1673
01:08:31,521 --> 01:08:33,980
out there in the parking lot of a 
riverside archery.

1674
01:08:33,981 --> 01:08:38,981
We had 46 yard shot and scott was laying
them in their nice tight group.

1675
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:41,043
We were shooting three arrows at a time.
I mean so and that's just in a day with 

1676
01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:47,060
that new blow that yet did.

1677
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:51,750
Kim and I were talking about this today,
if people knew how good it feels to like

1678
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:54,650
steady yourself,
anchor,

1679
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:57,650
like look to that peep site,
breathe,

1680
01:08:57,651 --> 01:09:00,380
release that arrow and watch it or 
something.

1681
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:03,070
Yeah,
it's the best feeling.

1682
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:04,150
It is.
So good.

1683
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,133
Well we,
we filmed today and so I took a shot is 

1684
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,353
61 yards at that with my big old heavy 
arrow and I shot and I was like run up 

1685
01:09:12,431 --> 01:09:13,264
to the,
to the binoculars and I look and it was 

1686
01:09:14,561 --> 01:09:16,110
a perfect shot and I was like so 
excited.

1687
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:16,944
He's like,
the first time I ever shot a bow and 

1688
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,410
that was not,
that's just how fun it is.

1689
01:09:20,411 --> 01:09:24,310
This is how excited I still get and 
we're just in people.

1690
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,240
I told joe,
I said,

1691
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:28,540
if people knew this or I mean they're 
going to watch this and go,

1692
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:31,150
I want to do that.
That looks awesome.

1693
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,490
If you're after 30 years,
you're getting this excited.

1694
01:09:33,491 --> 01:09:34,324
It's just up.
We were talking about this today and I 

1695
01:09:36,401 --> 01:09:37,840
want to bring this up and I think

1696
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,013
hoyt should do this.
The big entry barrier in in learning 

1697
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:47,930
archery is having someone teach you and 
like going somewhere and not knowing how

1698
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:50,570
to get started.
Like once you get started and you say,

1699
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,910
oh,
I'm a 28 inch straw.

1700
01:09:52,911 --> 01:09:56,690
Oh I like a 450 green arrow and you know
all the stuff that you need.

1701
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:59,450
Then it's,
it becomes easier to sort of do,

1702
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,570
but the beginning,
it's so daunting and confusing.

1703
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:05,120
The learning curve so long they should 
have,

1704
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:10,040
like hoyt should have a white academy or
a place you can go where you could buy a

1705
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:11,990
bow.
They size you,

1706
01:10:11,991 --> 01:10:12,824
they fill you up to the correct draw 
length and then you sign up for a class 

1707
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:18,330
and there's a teacher and they show you 
how to do it.

1708
01:10:18,331 --> 01:10:20,800
If there was something like that.
Whereas like you know,

1709
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:23,740
you can go take karate somewhere.
You could take jujitsu somewhere,

1710
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,480
go try to take archery somewhere.
There's not a lot of places.

1711
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,920
And if they are,
you know,

1712
01:10:27,921 --> 01:10:30,500
like the first place that I went to his.
Oh fucking sketchy.

1713
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:31,703
No they weren't.
They didn't really know my draw length 

1714
01:10:34,111 --> 01:10:34,960
is too long.

1715
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,950
It's a good pro.
Shops are hard to find.

1716
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,620
I,
I'm lucky with the bell rock back home.

1717
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,720
Um,
and wayne does that.

1718
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,070
Wayne takes,
takes the,

1719
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:44,913
teaches them right.
He coaches them and it seemed like 

1720
01:10:47,131 --> 01:10:50,850
riverside archery was that chris?
There Is a nice guy.

1721
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,760
Oh totally.
And totally knows archery to so.

1722
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:58,680
But those might be a unique examples 
because there's a lot of pro shops.

1723
01:10:58,950 --> 01:10:59,783
I mean,
this guy who works with under armour is 

1724
01:11:01,741 --> 01:11:04,250
telling me about his pro shot back home.
Um,

1725
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,900
they like,
we're almost making fun of him.

1726
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:08,370
His,
his actually not him,

1727
01:11:08,371 --> 01:11:11,760
but his cousin was in there trying to 
get set up with a bow and it's just like

1728
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,970
we made fun of him because,
you know,

1729
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,140
oh,
he didn't know.

1730
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,123
It was just like,
so you never know what you're going to 

1731
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:20,010
get.
You know,

1732
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:21,900
there's all sorts of different types of 
people out there.

1733
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,113
I pulled up to the hotel to come up to 
la to do some press and I open up the 

1734
01:11:28,091 --> 01:11:31,110
tell of the hotel beller and I opened up
the door of my truck.

1735
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:36,420
it had all the field trip come out like 
the bellman is looking at me going,

1736
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,430
what the fuck are you doing with 
compound bows in the car?

1737
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,410
In la?
Yeah.

1738
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,390
Yeah.
They don't know how to handle that.

1739
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:47,790
If you were in cams neighborhood,
they'd be like,

1740
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:50,220
oh,
you bowhunting out here though.

1741
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:52,170
I know chris.
Is this guy doing?

1742
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:52,670
Yeah.
yeah.

1743
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:55,140
It's going to kill somebody probably.
Right.

1744
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,233
Or you're a big walking dead fan show 
drives me crazy when those arrows just 

1745
01:12:00,751 --> 01:12:02,220
sticking the zombie heads.
I'm like,

1746
01:12:02,221 --> 01:12:04,200
why do they just stick?
Carpooling is no pass throughs,

1747
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,840
you know,
and that's a fighter.

1748
01:12:06,841 --> 01:12:09,270
And the kid Yesterday were,
they're asking about that.

1749
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:10,420
They're like,
what would an air date?

1750
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:12,060
Will you go halfway in like in the 
movies?

1751
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:13,810
And I'm like,
it wouldn't even.

1752
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:16,240
You wouldn't even feel it slow down.
Yeah.

1753
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:18,180
It would be like.
And I told them about the.

1754
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:20,490
We put up this bear quip.
Joe,

1755
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:21,443
before we,
I think before we realized the victim 

1756
01:12:23,941 --> 01:12:28,941
that will come out of of bear hunting,
but joe retweeted the video of this bear

1757
01:12:29,341 --> 01:12:30,174
stood up and it was grabbing this beaver
up there and I shot it and we had a 

1758
01:12:33,451 --> 01:12:37,710
gopro on the backside of it and the 
arrow went through the bear,

1759
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:38,573
came out the back side and it was just 
like didn't even slow down now and just 

1760
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:45,360
kind of all this stuff kind of came out 
with the arrow just like,

1761
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:46,223
what was the sound?

1762
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:53,190
That's the sound that arrow made through
the glass through the bear's body.

1763
01:12:53,191 --> 01:12:55,890
And then the bear went on a full sprInt.
Yeah.

1764
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:56,893
Know,
like almost right where you guys work 

1765
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:01,430
slightly off to your right.
and when,

1766
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,480
if you've never seen a bear sprint 
before,

1767
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:06,090
like when you see them lumber around you
go,

1768
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:08,200
oh well I kind of get an idea without 
thinking,

1769
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,130
do bull shit.
You know,

1770
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:13,050
that thing is like usain bolt when you 
threw an arrow through it.

1771
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,010
Right?
And that.

1772
01:13:14,011 --> 01:13:14,844
So that was a 400 pound bear.
So you could imagine what brian was 

1773
01:13:18,241 --> 01:13:19,110
asking about.
What is he,

1774
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,080
160 pounds?
that's about 110.

1775
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,001
Maybe one.
Oh,

1776
01:13:24,001 --> 01:13:25,230
six.
Somewhere around there.

1777
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:26,820
But anyway,
I told her,

1778
01:13:26,821 --> 01:13:27,301
I said,
yeah,

1779
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:30,750
these bows wouldn't even slow down.
You wouldn't even know what I mean.

1780
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:31,673
you would be too late.
It would go through you and then you'd 

1781
01:13:33,181 --> 01:13:33,600
go,
what?

1782
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,261
Just say,
oh,

1783
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:35,530
why am I?
Yeah.

1784
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,200
Yeah,
I see grandpa.

1785
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,310
Yeah.
So walking dead,

1786
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:42,860
grandpa grandpa's reaching out.
Man,

1787
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:44,143
I missed that.
I missed that skateboard through the 

1788
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:46,560
clouds.
But yeah.

1789
01:13:46,561 --> 01:13:48,120
So with the,
with the walking dead.

1790
01:13:48,121 --> 01:13:48,954
Yeah.
There you got some rotten zombie head 

1791
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:51,910
and the arrows are just sticking in it.
Say,

1792
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:53,250
hey,
speaking of near death experience,

1793
01:13:53,251 --> 01:13:54,084
I wanted to ask you this because I 
listen to podcasts a lot and I talk 

1794
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:01,420
about dmt and you know,
some of the stuff you see when you know,

1795
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,920
like it produces in your mind.
Are you producing in your body,

1796
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:09,300
right?
Is that the chemical that you released?

1797
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,130
Like when you die or when you have like 
near death experience?

1798
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,050
They believe so here's the,
here's the,

1799
01:14:14,051 --> 01:14:14,884
here's the deal.
They didn't know for sure until really 

1800
01:14:17,171 --> 01:14:18,470
recently.
That was easy.

1801
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:21,250
It was even produced by the pineal 
gland.

1802
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:22,143
Now that they know there's a guy named 
is produced by a guy named rick 

1803
01:14:25,751 --> 01:14:26,584
strassman,
dr rick strassman out of the university 

1804
01:14:28,241 --> 01:14:29,074
of New Mexico and he put a put together 
these clinical trials that were the 

1805
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:33,844
first ever fda approved clinical trials 
on a psychedelic drug first ever on dmt 

1806
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:39,243
and they were done in New Mexico and he 
did them and he wrote a book about it 

1807
01:14:42,731 --> 01:14:43,564
called dmt,
the spirit molecule and one of the 

1808
01:14:45,161 --> 01:14:45,994
things that he found.
It's a great book and one of the things 

1809
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:48,274
you found really fascinating,
and I read the book before I ever did 

1810
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:50,614
dmt.
The thing that he found really 

1811
01:14:51,761 --> 01:14:55,000
fascinating was that these people had 
used uniform experiences.

1812
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,193
It wasn't like one person saw this thing
and then another person had a totally 

1813
01:14:59,411 --> 01:14:59,890
different trip.

1814
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:00,723
Now they all had like fairly uniform 
experiences and here's the other thing 

1815
01:15:03,941 --> 01:15:04,774
that's really fascinating.
Their experiences in manY ways mirror 

1816
01:15:07,991 --> 01:15:08,824
the experiences of people that have been
abducted by aliens and people that have 

1817
01:15:13,511 --> 01:15:14,344
near death experiences and the 
connection they think is that the brain 

1818
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:20,950
produces this chemical called 
dimethyltryptamine and we know that it's

1819
01:15:20,951 --> 01:15:21,784
produced by the liver and we know that 
it's produced by the lungs and then in 

1820
01:15:24,371 --> 01:15:25,204
eastern mysticism it was always thought 
that the pineal gland was the seed of 

1821
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:30,240
the soul.
That It was the.

1822
01:15:30,241 --> 01:15:31,750
The,
the third eye.

1823
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:35,440
Then in literally in reptiles as it as a
retina and cornea.

1824
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:36,663
It actually,
it's like literally an eyeball in the 

1825
01:15:38,141 --> 01:15:38,974
center of your head and in the vatican 
there's a gigantic sculpture of a pine 

1826
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:45,424
cone in the vatican and that pine cone 
is supposed to represent the pineal 

1827
01:15:49,571 --> 01:15:52,780
gland so you can get a photo of that 
gigantic pine cone.

1828
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:53,913
And I was actually in the vatican last 
summer and I had a conversation with a 

1829
01:15:56,501 --> 01:15:57,334
guide.
We have this really cool guy who was a 

1830
01:15:58,061 --> 01:16:01,890
professor who was explaining to us all 
the different stuff that you know,

1831
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,733
it's all the different symbolisms and 
what they mean and they've eastern 

1832
01:16:07,361 --> 01:16:11,500
mysticism and a lot of ancient religions
have always been focused,

1833
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:12,453
heavily focused on the pine cone and 
pineal gland and that is what that's 

1834
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:21,151
supposed to represent that,
that gigantic pine cone in the middle of

1835
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:25,120
like people smoke pine cone or there's 
some people.

1836
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,013
Yeah,
there's some people smoke socks If you 

1837
01:16:26,891 --> 01:16:31,891
give them to them,
but what I heard,

1838
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:34,203
I heard that,
I mean over that now that there's some 

1839
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:38,410
sort of dmt is like plant.
It's plant based.

1840
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,513
That is the thing is that the dmt 
doesn't just exist in one plant exists 

1841
01:16:43,991 --> 01:16:44,824
in thousands of different plants.
That's why they have iowasca when 

1842
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,240
iowasca is,
is an orally active dmt.

1843
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,030
So dmt.
Normally when you eat it,

1844
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:56,163
your body produces something in your 
digestive digestive track called mano 

1845
01:17:00,131 --> 01:17:01,900
aiming oxidate the blocks it,
right?

1846
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:02,783
Yeah.
And so what iowasca is dmt from one 

1847
01:17:06,071 --> 01:17:06,904
plant and an mao inhibitor for another 
plant and combine it together and they 

1848
01:17:10,341 --> 01:17:11,174
create an orally active dmt because 
otherwise you'd just be tripping every 

1849
01:17:14,361 --> 01:17:16,460
time you eat a salad like you,
you,

1850
01:17:16,461 --> 01:17:18,650
you get some wheat grass juice,
you chip your balls off,

1851
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:19,723
but your body keeps that from happening.
But the purpose of that dmt and what it 

1852
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:28,280
does in human neurochemistry is not 
really understood that well,

1853
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,233
but what they do know now,
because of rick strassman and the work 

1854
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:31,964
of the cottonwood research foundation,
which is a foundation that's dedicated 

1855
01:17:35,391 --> 01:17:39,290
to exploring these subjects.
They've found that in live rats,

1856
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:40,970
rats or mice,
I forget which one,

1857
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:46,010
that they've proven that their pineal 
gland is producing dimethyltryptamine,

1858
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,360
which is what they've always.

1859
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:48,323
It's always been anecdotal evidence,
so now they know that it's not just 

1860
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:51,644
produced by the liver and the lungs,
but it's also produced by this little 

1861
01:17:53,391 --> 01:17:58,370
gland and this little gland.
They think during near death experiences

1862
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:02,150
and during heavy rem sleep,
it's producing dmt.

1863
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,013
How much they don't really know because 
they would have to get in there and 

1864
01:18:05,631 --> 01:18:06,464
they'd have to somehow or another figure
out a way to measure it while you were 

1865
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:09,764
alive.
They haven't figured out how to do that 

1866
01:18:11,001 --> 01:18:12,410
yet because it's in the center of your 
head.

1867
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:13,244
They'd have to drill and tap it and who 
knows how the fuck they could do that 

1868
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:17,203
with today's technology,
but maybe someday in the future they'll 

1869
01:18:18,641 --> 01:18:19,790
be able to figure that out.
No,

1870
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:20,843
I mean I'm fascinated by it ever since 
listening to you talk about it and then 

1871
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,910
watching your documentary on dmt,
the spirit molecule molecule,

1872
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:30,680
and it was all based on strassman's 
work.

1873
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:31,930
Yeah.
So I mean it's,

1874
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:34,220
it's crazy.
And then I tried it one time and it was,

1875
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:35,443
it was,
it was unlike anything for the 10 

1876
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:39,230
minutes I've ever experienced in my 
entire life.

1877
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,180
Um,
and so it was,

1878
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:42,493
you know,
after that I've obviously read all this 

1879
01:18:43,271 --> 01:18:44,540
stuff.
Try to,

1880
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,433
you know,
what's interesting is I think no one 

1881
01:18:46,971 --> 01:18:49,640
will probably ever know until you do it 
or no,

1882
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:53,980
I just mean like there's something,
there's a phenomenon happening.

1883
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:58,790
we as humans can't possibly understand,
will never understand in our lifetime.

1884
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,631
Well,
you know,

1885
01:18:59,631 --> 01:19:00,770
there's two different ways of looking at
it.

1886
01:19:00,771 --> 01:19:01,604
Yeah.
One is that it's a human neurochemistry 

1887
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:05,043
and that there's a chemical that is just
producing these crazy visuals and it's 

1888
01:19:08,241 --> 01:19:10,610
just all the meaning attached to is just
your own.

1889
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:11,983
And then the other way of looking at it 
is it's some sort of a chemical gateway 

1890
01:19:14,631 --> 01:19:18,730
into the afterlife life and that what 
you're seeing is like the souls of these

1891
01:19:18,731 --> 01:19:19,564
people that have lived before and all 
the people that have ever lived like a 

1892
01:19:21,911 --> 01:19:25,390
sea of souls and I don't know what,
who's right or who's wrong,

1893
01:19:25,391 --> 01:19:26,224
but it's impossible to describe like 
describe it as just like you're just 

1894
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:31,570
throwing words around.

1895
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,980
It doesn't.
It doesn't work,

1896
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,830
you know,
and it's produced by your own body.

1897
01:19:35,831 --> 01:19:37,930
that's the weirdest thing.
Like everybody has it.

1898
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,830
Like terence mckenna used to joke about 
it.

1899
01:19:39,831 --> 01:19:43,060
He said everybody's holding.
It's a schedule one compound,

1900
01:19:43,061 --> 01:19:45,100
but everybody tests positive for it.
Like it's,

1901
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,420
it's a,
it's illegal but illegal.

1902
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,870
One hundred percent.
How do they,

1903
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,330
how do they decide what it's going to be
illegal if it's,

1904
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:53,323
you know,
if it's a plant based problem that is 

1905
01:19:54,521 --> 01:19:55,354
the problem.
Just plants that all contain it are all 

1906
01:19:57,741 --> 01:19:58,990
illegal.
They're all,

1907
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:02,770
they are all legal and then it's 
illegal,

1908
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:05,860
but it's in all these legal plants,
but it's in thousands of plants.

1909
01:20:05,861 --> 01:20:06,694
That's part of the problem.
It's like you can have a san pedro 

1910
01:20:09,391 --> 01:20:12,180
cactus and keep it in your house and 
everybody's like,

1911
01:20:12,181 --> 01:20:13,020
what's that like?
Oh,

1912
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:16,430
it's pretty cactus.
Yeah.

1913
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:19,530
But it's also,
there's drugs in that fucking cactus.

1914
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:25,040
I meAn that's where mescalin comes from.
Comes from that trip your balls off from

1915
01:20:26,761 --> 01:20:28,650
a fucking cactus.
That's crazy.

1916
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:31,590
Yeah.
I mean when the pod rituals,

1917
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:32,453
that's from a cactus san pedro cactus is
this in the same thing as pay and so I 

1918
01:20:36,621 --> 01:20:38,490
think,
see if you can google that.

1919
01:20:38,491 --> 01:20:39,324
Jamie pay.
I believe that pod and masculine or 

1920
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:43,980
slang or something.
Is it?

1921
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:45,143
Yeah.
Masculine is occurs naturally in the 

1922
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:47,763
pod.
Cactus.

1923
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:48,623
Yeah.
So you could have that cactus in your 

1924
01:20:49,741 --> 01:20:51,330
house and you're basically a drug 
dealer,

1925
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,470
but meanwhile you're not.
You're a little old lady.

1926
01:20:53,471 --> 01:20:55,490
You enjoy succulents,
you know,

1927
01:20:55,870 --> 01:21:00,870
like go out of town for a week and come 
back and it's fine.

1928
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,513
Yeah.
So that's a really cool looking cactus 

1929
01:21:03,511 --> 01:21:05,850
that people keep in their yard all the 
time in la.

1930
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:07,003
Like one of the things in la because of 
the drought that we have for so many 

1931
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,670
years until this year,
which is awesome.

1932
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:13,080
Everything looks like New Zealand out 
there now.

1933
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,600
It is nice,
but people would have these uh,

1934
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:16,523
hardscapes in their yards where they 
have just have rocks and succulents and 

1935
01:21:20,401 --> 01:21:21,234
cactus.
So there's a lot of people that have 

1936
01:21:22,231 --> 01:21:23,850
those cactuses,
that cactus.

1937
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:26,040
You could go meet jesus with that 
cactus.

1938
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:28,440
Have you done it?
No.

1939
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:29,820
No,
no dumb pot.

1940
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,140
Yeah.
That seems a,

1941
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:33,480
it seems like a pRetty cool long time 
though,

1942
01:21:33,481 --> 01:21:35,760
right?
It's one of the longer ones I think.

1943
01:21:35,761 --> 01:21:36,594
I think it's a few hours,
but so as iowasca haven't done that 

1944
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:41,550
either.
I've only done the dmt.

1945
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,210
Dmt is like a shorter,
more potent form of it,

1946
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:49,470
but I've done it several times over the 
course of an evening where it's like,

1947
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:53,640
been like a couple hour experience.
Do you feel like it's obviously,

1948
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,050
you know,
people who have done it,

1949
01:21:55,051 --> 01:21:55,884
they know it's just,
it's not something that you're doing 

1950
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,130
recreationally,
it's something that's like,

1951
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:00,750
okay,
you do this this one time,

1952
01:22:00,751 --> 01:22:02,160
it's or,
or,

1953
01:22:02,161 --> 01:22:03,000
you know,
a couple of times.

1954
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,890
It's not like you're out going to the 
club.

1955
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:06,300
Oh no.
You know what I mean?

1956
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:07,134
It's a very spiritual sort of thing.
You do that word spiritual is so beaten 

1957
01:22:11,581 --> 01:22:12,414
down.
It's oNe of those words that I don't 

1958
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:15,720
even like to use because it's,
you know what I mean?

1959
01:22:15,721 --> 01:22:17,970
It's like so many people,
like I'm not religious,

1960
01:22:17,971 --> 01:22:20,730
but I'm spiritual.
It almost seems like,

1961
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:22,283
you know what I mean?
It seems like they get a spiritual 

1962
01:22:23,161 --> 01:22:24,900
gangster shit.
I'm about to throw away as soon as I get

1963
01:22:24,901 --> 01:22:26,730
home.
Joe rogan says not cool.

1964
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:27,631
Well,
it's not that.

1965
01:22:27,631 --> 01:22:28,500
It's not cool.
It's just,

1966
01:22:28,530 --> 01:22:31,650
it's kind of been cooptive by nonsense.
Sure.

1967
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:34,200
You know,
and not even nonsense intentionally.

1968
01:22:34,201 --> 01:22:35,520
I mean,
people say that they,

1969
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:36,413
like,
they'll say things and they don't mean 

1970
01:22:37,441 --> 01:22:38,274
anything.
It's not that they're lying or they're 

1971
01:22:40,051 --> 01:22:40,884
being deceptive.
It's just that it's such a problematic 

1972
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:43,554
word.

1973
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:44,251
No.
Yeah.

1974
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:45,540
What I,
what I mean,

1975
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:47,340
I guess I can say better is,
is uh,

1976
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,593
it's,
it's a experience that is something 

1977
01:22:53,381 --> 01:22:55,020
that's very powerful.
It's very brief.

1978
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,520
Yeah,
it's profound and,

1979
01:22:56,521 --> 01:22:59,030
and you,
you want to sort of do it and,

1980
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:03,340
and talk about it and have a collective 
sort of discussion about it.

1981
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:04,733
And it's also,
there's also a real problem with 

1982
01:23:06,131 --> 01:23:06,964
perception,
especially amongst people that haven't 

1983
01:23:08,231 --> 01:23:09,064
experienced psychedelic drugs that when 
you say the word drug or each day 

1984
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:13,234
psychedelic compounds,
maybe because when you say the word 

1985
01:23:14,591 --> 01:23:16,960
drug,
people automatically have in their head,

1986
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:18,550
oh,
you're a weak person.

1987
01:23:18,551 --> 01:23:19,384
You're trying to hide from reality.
You know that you're trying to shield 

1988
01:23:22,001 --> 01:23:22,834
your sale.
You're just trying to get high and just 

1989
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:26,590
lay around.
I only want to be here,

1990
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,770
man.
Couldn't be further from the truth.

1991
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:30,723
It's like one of the most self 
exploratory opening and deeply 

1992
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:38,470
disturbing and it's profound and 
powerful effects.

1993
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:42,100
It's very shocking and you leave it 
once.

1994
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:44,020
It's over you.
You're a different person,

1995
01:23:44,021 --> 01:23:44,854
man.
Now that you just,

1996
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:47,230
now that you know that that's a real 
possibility,

1997
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:49,660
you're going to be a different person.
Yeah.

1998
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:50,643
Maybe I was maybe won't,
I mean it mean it depends on where 

1999
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,880
you're coming into it and then what kind
of defense mechanisms you have,

2000
01:23:57,881 --> 01:24:01,690
what kind of an ego you have,
whether or not you can just realize like

2001
01:24:01,691 --> 01:24:02,524
now that you've seen this,
you know that life will never be the 

2002
01:24:05,891 --> 01:24:06,724
same again.
You're always going to know that that's 

2003
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:08,854
a possibility that you can smoke this 
crystal powder that is extracted from 

2004
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,073
plants and when you smoke it,
you're transported to a world of love 

2005
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:20,254
and understanding and geometric patterns
of infinite description to the point 

2006
01:24:25,241 --> 01:24:26,760
where like you can't even describe.
You don't.

2007
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:28,870
You don't even know what you're looking 
at while you're looking at it.

2008
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:33,610
It's just so beyond like lifts the veil 
on what we think is reality.

2009
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:35,290
Yeah,
and it might be heaven,

2010
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:37,360
it might be the afterlife.
It really might be.

2011
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:39,700
It might be.
There might be a reason why people think

2012
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:40,893
that heaven is filled with ultimate love
because people have had near death 

2013
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:44,374
experiences and they've come back with 
these stories and during those near 

2014
01:24:46,391 --> 01:24:47,224
death experiences,
it's entirely possible not just 

2015
01:24:49,661 --> 01:24:50,950
speculative,
not just like.

2016
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,833
It might absolutely be that your brain 
is producing this dimethyltryptamine 

2017
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,460
that had already produced in high doses 
and that's what it's there for.

2018
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:02,920
We don't know for sure,
but you've done it.

2019
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:04,150
Yup.
Yeah.

2020
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:06,940
A lot of people have done it now by more
people than ever.

2021
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,790
It's crazy in history for sure.
For sure.

2022
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:10,624
More people listening to this now have 
experienced dmt than probably at any 

2023
01:25:14,831 --> 01:25:16,030
time in human history

2024
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:16,861
and it.
Yeah.

2025
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:18,820
I tell people when they ask,
you know,

2026
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:21,610
if you haven't done it,
you should do it because it's,

2027
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:23,530
it's mind opening.
You know,

2028
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:24,091
you go,
well,

2029
01:25:24,091 --> 01:25:25,390
okay.
You realize that you.

2030
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,430
It's humbling.
I think to,

2031
01:25:26,431 --> 01:25:28,860
you know,
there's a lot we don't understand what's

2032
01:25:28,861 --> 01:25:31,620
happening and then we may never 
understand and,

2033
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:35,760
and to be so closed minded to think we 
know one path or the other,

2034
01:25:35,761 --> 01:25:37,800
what's the right thing or the wrong 
thing.

2035
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:39,570
It's just really arrogant.

2036
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:42,640
It's very ego shattering,
it's very ego shattering and it also,

2037
01:25:42,641 --> 01:25:45,190
once you know that that's possible,
that's like,

2038
01:25:45,191 --> 01:25:46,024
how is that possible?
How Is it possible that you're just 30 

2039
01:25:47,861 --> 01:25:49,970
seconds away from that at any time?
And uh,

2040
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,120
it was crazy.
Wow.

2041
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:52,900
Yeah.
Can experience that.

2042
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:53,950
No,
no,

2043
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:55,730
I can't.
I get drug tested at work.

2044
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,610
He drinks miller light though.
Why don't think it's even.

2045
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,280
That wouldn't even come up on a drug is 
a plant based.

2046
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:00,730
Right?
I meAn,

2047
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:01,563
that wouldn't come up in your test.
Positive for it always says you have it 

2048
01:26:05,301 --> 01:26:06,170
in your system.
Okay,

2049
01:26:06,171 --> 01:26:08,030
let's do it.
Whereas back home,

2050
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:11,160
just kidding.
We've got to go into a vault and michael

2051
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,230
get mad at us.
Why he was mad that you're talking about

2052
01:26:15,231 --> 01:26:19,640
smoking pot all the time.
Really one couple of days ago for real.

2053
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:23,300
What was he mad at that I don't know.

2054
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:25,850
Silly.
Why would anybody mad at that?

2055
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:27,790
Awesome.
Settle down,

2056
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:28,663
mike.
He talks about drinking beer all the 

2057
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:30,590
time.
Mike's always drunk,

2058
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,813
like they did this whole thing where 
he's talking about being in vegas and 

2059
01:26:33,741 --> 01:26:34,600
you know,
he was uh,

2060
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:36,800
talking to gsp.
Gsp is like,

2061
01:26:36,801 --> 01:26:37,371
you know,
drunk.

2062
01:26:37,371 --> 01:26:38,210
He goes,
of course I'm drunk.

2063
01:26:38,211 --> 01:26:41,150
I'm in vegas because I just got here.
I was drinking last night.

2064
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:43,580
He doesn't put up all the time that he's
drinking beer.

2065
01:26:43,581 --> 01:26:46,510
Did you see this jamie gsp,
gsp?

2066
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:47,540
Uh,
no.

2067
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,080
Bisbing about go.
You're talking about gsp?

2068
01:26:51,450 --> 01:26:52,220
No.
No.

2069
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,030
Bisping was drunk.
Okay.

2070
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,840
And he and gsp called them out on it.
Like you said,

2071
01:26:56,841 --> 01:26:58,490
like you smelled like alcohol.
He's like,

2072
01:26:58,491 --> 01:26:59,420
yeah,
I was drinking all night.

2073
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:01,130
The fuck's wrong with you.
I'm in vegas.

2074
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:02,743
Well,
why would bisbing be upset that I talk 

2075
01:27:04,401 --> 01:27:05,234
about beer?
Or I talk about pot when he's always 

2076
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:07,514
talking about beer.

2077
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,890
That's silly.
Maybe that's not true.

2078
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:11,900
What'd you sure.
Jamie,

2079
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:12,973
you find that james is going to find it.
Hit his talking about you and just make 

2080
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:17,450
fun of me.
You and diaz.

2081
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:19,123
Nick diaz.
That's probably trying to get a fight 

2082
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:22,430
with nick diaz.
That's probably what it is.

2083
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:26,300
Maybe england for a fight.
I figured you would've seen it though.

2084
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,970
I love michael.
I think he's a bad motherfucker.

2085
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:30,680
Yeah,
that guy is tough as shit,

2086
01:27:30,681 --> 01:27:32,300
man.
Can't even see out of one eye.

2087
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:34,520
I know.
Got one of the top fucked up.

2088
01:27:34,521 --> 01:27:35,354
They filled it.
They did an operation on it and then 

2089
01:27:36,591 --> 01:27:39,260
filled it up with oil so that,
um,

2090
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,530
it doesn't.
The retina doesn't rupture again when,

2091
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,270
uh,
so he's fighting gsp.

2092
01:27:44,271 --> 01:27:45,104
When is that?
Do we know when they do not have a date 

2093
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:47,503
but trying to figure it out.
But bisping has said that if gsp can't 

2094
01:27:49,971 --> 01:27:51,860
make it by july,
he'll find somebody else.

2095
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:53,383
So he might fight michael bisping blast 
joe rogan and nick diaz for positively 

2096
01:27:57,621 --> 01:27:59,280
promoting cannabis told ya.

2097
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,710
But that might not be real.
Like,

2098
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,630
you know,
by saying blasts,

2099
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:08,030
you'd have to hear like what he actually
said.

2100
01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:10,370
I can't tell what it's from.
It's all click bait nowadays.

2101
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:14,150
She might've just seen that.
It might have literally an oh,

2102
01:28:14,151 --> 01:28:15,620
he's probably hanging out with joe 
rogan.

2103
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:17,553
See that?
Uh,

2104
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:22,670
that 60 minutes on a.
I know there's words that you think fake

2105
01:28:23,151 --> 01:28:25,430
news or whatever.
You see the 60 minutes on it?

2106
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:27,250
Hashtag.
Oh yeah.

2107
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,113
I mean,
you know that word sort of popular now 

2108
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:33,440
because I think,
I don't know if some people have said it

2109
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,510
in popular,
but it's,

2110
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,040
it's uh,
it's amazing now.

2111
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:41,180
All the people profiting on it.
It really showcases.

2112
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:44,840
You should check out the 60 minutes.
Do you remember the,

2113
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:48,390
you saved me from a bear attack.
There was,

2114
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,110
there was a ha.
I got attacked by a bear.

2115
01:28:51,111 --> 01:28:55,790
Joe shot the bear and there's a whole 
article that was all it was.

2116
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:58,880
I got one that said I killed a mountain 
line with my belt.

2117
01:28:59,030 --> 01:29:02,160
That's right.
I had a house in pasadena.

2118
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:02,930
Yeah.

2119
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:04,560
Do you do what,
what do you,

2120
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:06,110
what do you think about that,
that you think that it's,

2121
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:07,363
it's,
uh,

2122
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:08,953
I mean all that stuff is pretty.
Do you think there should be controls 

2123
01:29:11,661 --> 01:29:13,730
over it?
Like just outside of being,

2124
01:29:13,731 --> 01:29:14,391
you know,
the fcc,

2125
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:16,190
being able to like sue people,
whatever.

2126
01:29:16,191 --> 01:29:18,080
That never really happens.
IT feels like.

2127
01:29:18,081 --> 01:29:18,920
Do you think that it should.

2128
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:23,380
I don't know,
like things like the onion,

2129
01:29:23,470 --> 01:29:25,300
it's like when do you draw the line?
Because the onion,

2130
01:29:25,301 --> 01:29:26,134
it's hilarious,
so they'll make a like a subtle parody 

2131
01:29:28,031 --> 01:29:28,864
of something and make it completely 
preposterous and then pull up a good 

2132
01:29:32,051 --> 01:29:35,860
example of an onion headline was like 
the onion.

2133
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:39,400
Do you don't know what the onion is?
The onion is a famous parody,

2134
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:42,610
new site where they make stories that 
just.

2135
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:43,743
If you're smart,
you read it and you go what the bear 

2136
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,870
somebody who is making an parody on it.
Yeah,

2137
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,020
yeah.
In a way.

2138
01:29:50,021 --> 01:29:50,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

2139
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:51,663
And most of them are pretty humorous,
but occasionally people will tweet me 

2140
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:59,110
with like an onion store and like,
can you fucking believe this shit man,

2141
01:29:59,170 --> 01:30:03,170
it's good now to control.
And then you read it and go dummy,

2142
01:30:03,171 --> 01:30:05,740
this is a,
this is comedy writing.

2143
01:30:05,890 --> 01:30:07,120
People don't have common sense.

2144
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:07,953
So that's a problem with that quickbase 
stuff as they believe it because they 

2145
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,160
can't read it and be like,
ah,

2146
01:30:12,161 --> 01:30:15,190
that's probably whatever.
It's just like they believe everything.

2147
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:17,470
Yeah.
But I mean isn't that the case with like

2148
01:30:17,471 --> 01:30:18,304
cults in the moonies and scientology and
like there's a lot of nonsense that 

2149
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:22,624
people believe in.
It's not hard to get people to believe 

2150
01:30:24,641 --> 01:30:25,900
in shit.
Sure.

2151
01:30:25,901 --> 01:30:27,520
That's a good question.
Like what do we do about it?

2152
01:30:27,521 --> 01:30:30,130
Do you leave it up to common sense,
which isn't very common today,

2153
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:35,380
or do you do step in rookie justice gore
such.

2154
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:37,780
How do you say his name assigned to 
supreme court.

2155
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,150
Overnight shift a joke.
See,

2156
01:30:40,151 --> 01:30:43,600
because he's a new supreme court guy and
they're giving them the shitty gig.

2157
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:44,890
See,
that's not real,

2158
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,360
but if somebody read that,
they were like,

2159
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:48,070
this is bullshit.
These fucking liberals.

2160
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:49,690
They're just because she's a 
conservative.

2161
01:30:49,691 --> 01:30:50,524
They're putting it on the night shift.
Night shift man tries using pink six 

2162
01:30:55,421 --> 01:30:59,840
pound bowling ball to great amusement.
That's not really to see like.

2163
01:30:59,841 --> 01:31:00,674
It's like what they do.
They write these articles that are 

2164
01:31:02,471 --> 01:31:03,304
comedy.

2165
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:06,850
They fake their poses news,
which is a little.

2166
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:08,530
I think it's different because right.
If you have.

2167
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:13,970
If your fiction and you're posing as as 
real news,

2168
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,330
it's like,
where do you were?

2169
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:20,223
You knoW,
obviously like there's no more 

2170
01:31:21,670 --> 01:31:23,290
journalistic integrity.
It feels.

2171
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:28,320
It feels like there are some.
It just feels like there's a,

2172
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,690
you know,
it's just an ad.

2173
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:31,920
You,
how do you know?

2174
01:31:31,930 --> 01:31:33,910
How did you know?
You read the news?

2175
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,610
You're misinformed.
You don't read it,

2176
01:31:36,611 --> 01:31:38,080
you're misinformed.
You're not informed.

2177
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:38,610
He was like,
well,

2178
01:31:38,610 --> 01:31:39,443
you know,
what do you do?

2179
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:42,310
So have you been the topic of something?
Oh,

2180
01:31:42,311 --> 01:31:42,731
I mean,
yeah,

2181
01:31:42,731 --> 01:31:43,241
there's.
I mean,

2182
01:31:43,241 --> 01:31:45,220
there's been fake stuff about me.
Sure.

2183
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,230
My setting,
my dad saying,

2184
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,910
I believe half of what you see and then 
what you hear,

2185
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:49,773
you know,
I always laugh because probably some 

2186
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:52,890
silly thing.
My friends will come to me and say,

2187
01:31:52,891 --> 01:31:55,380
hey,
do you really know I didn't do that?

2188
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:57,430
And there's a ton of fake stuff out 
there.

2189
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:59,530
THere's a ton of fixed.
I'm sure there's a ton stuff about you.

2190
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:00,250
Oh yeah,

2191
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,660
yeah.
I just won recently by disarmed a guide,

2192
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:05,210
the comedy store.
Some guy had a gun and I disarmed him.

2193
01:32:05,211 --> 01:32:06,400
My buddy of mine was a cop,
said,

2194
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:08,490
hey man,
congratulations on the job.

2195
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:09,310
Do like,
what?

2196
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:10,600
Good job.
What did I do?

2197
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:12,490
You save.
you save people's lives,

2198
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:14,080
but you can ruin someone's life,
you know,

2199
01:32:14,081 --> 01:32:16,810
in a second,
in some way.

2200
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:18,130
Say the wrong word,
some,

2201
01:32:18,131 --> 01:32:18,964
you know,
someone says he got throw is allegedly 

2202
01:32:21,431 --> 01:32:22,740
or something.
Sure.

2203
01:32:22,930 --> 01:32:24,770
Allegedly raped somebody or something,
you know,

2204
01:32:24,771 --> 01:32:27,750
they ruined some poor guy's life.
Uh,

2205
01:32:27,780 --> 01:32:30,700
you know,
reputation just out the out the window.

2206
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:31,563
Well,
that's what they've always been able to 

2207
01:32:31,751 --> 01:32:34,810
do with those supermarket tabloids say,
allegedly from a source.

2208
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:38,910
A source tells us that campaigns likes 
to be careful here.

2209
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:40,690
Exactly what I'm saying.

2210
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:45,493
You don't have to do much more than that
and you kind of cover your ass and you 

2211
01:32:48,131 --> 01:32:48,964
say,
I have to protect my sources of first 

2212
01:32:50,021 --> 01:32:50,681
amendment.
Right.

2213
01:32:50,681 --> 01:32:51,514
And yes,
it's a weird time and it's a weird time 

2214
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:57,490
because essentially the boundaries to 
publication have been dissolved.

2215
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:58,653
It used to be that you had to work for 
the New York times or the Washington 

2216
01:33:01,241 --> 01:33:02,740
post or a newspaper,
whatever.

2217
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:07,390
Now just all you need is a blog or a 
facebook page and your breaking news,

2218
01:33:07,391 --> 01:33:09,550
you know,
and just scott eastwood admits to,

2219
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:10,673
you know,
wearing women's clothes while you're 

2220
01:33:11,741 --> 01:33:14,830
hunting for deer.
Larry,

2221
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:15,790
larry,
david,

2222
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:16,350
larry,
david.

2223
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:17,290
I wear women's underwear.

2224
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:21,460
One of the best line.
That was strange.

2225
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,630
It is definitely,
you're right.

2226
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:23,770
It's definitely strange,
but I mean,

2227
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,780
but who's to decide?
I mean,

2228
01:33:25,781 --> 01:33:28,210
I know tHey're trying to work on some 
ways to figure it out.

2229
01:33:28,211 --> 01:33:32,740
I know facebook is working on some 
different ways to block fake news,

2230
01:33:32,741 --> 01:33:36,130
but who's to decide what's fake and 
what's real and who's to decide where it

2231
01:33:36,131 --> 01:33:38,350
becomes parody.
When is it funny?

2232
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:39,213
Like when is it the onion,
when it's pretty subtle and when is it 

2233
01:33:41,471 --> 01:33:43,810
just some guy making up a story about 
you?

2234
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:47,140
Me saving you from a bear attack when 
it's weird.

2235
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:49,810
I know I'm ronald sweater.
Yeah.

2236
01:33:49,970 --> 01:33:50,803
No,
I'm really.

2237
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:52,840
I'm really concerned.
Yeah,

2238
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:53,993
y'all.
Yeah,

2239
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:56,130
like asleep.
Okay.

2240
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,620
But uh,
it's a weird sign of the times.

2241
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:03,450
The times are weird.
We have weird times and this,

2242
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:04,553
the ability to communicate where anybody
can do anything at any time and not 

2243
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:08,980
everybody could find out about it.

2244
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:11,560
Like you could write something on your 
twitter page,

2245
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:12,543
just publish it and then it gets to the 
right amount of people and then they 

2246
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:19,670
share it and then all of a sudden a 
million people have seen it inside of an

2247
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:21,820
hour.
And I know it's crazy,

2248
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:25,600
but it's good to get,
I mean we've used that for our benefit.

2249
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:28,720
That's what you do all the time.
But I do have a voice.

2250
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:29,583
I mean it's,
this made you have a vo or me have a 

2251
01:34:31,691 --> 01:34:32,381
voice,
you know,

2252
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:34,630
you've always had one,
but make me have one.

2253
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:37,060
And so it's,
it's an amazing time to.

2254
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:38,043
Well even my voice is a way different 
now like having a podcast and that's 

2255
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:41,593
much,
much in a lot of ways the same thing 

2256
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:47,200
because it's just,
I mean this is a pretty lean operation.

2257
01:34:47,201 --> 01:34:49,470
Obviously.
Just a surprise,

2258
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:51,910
just a computer,
you know,

2259
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:56,950
a jamie to figure it out and then we 
talk and then upload it.

2260
01:34:57,770 --> 01:34:58,640
And that's it.
Yep.

2261
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:01,490
Is that.
There's not a whole lot of steps and yet

2262
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:03,440
this will probably get 5 million 
downloads,

2263
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,670
you know,
maybe even more.

2264
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:05,750
So.
It's weird.

2265
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:06,633
Yeah,
it's weird in that sense that it can 

2266
01:35:07,641 --> 01:35:10,440
reach so many different people.
And then it's,

2267
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:12,890
there's,
there's no corporation behind it,

2268
01:35:12,891 --> 01:35:13,724
there's no Washington post.
So we could just sit here and just make 

2269
01:35:15,141 --> 01:35:18,800
up a bunch of fake shit and just be 
really adamant that this really happened

2270
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,690
and they were going to leave it.
And how could,

2271
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:25,130
could someone stop you from doing that?
I don't know if theY could,

2272
01:35:25,131 --> 01:35:27,080
you know,
as long as you're not slandering anybody

2273
01:35:27,081 --> 01:35:29,300
and you're not getting sued.
So I did want.

2274
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,220
So what's your prediction if,
uh,

2275
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:36,370
if bisbing and gsp fight very 
interesting fight because bisping's been

2276
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:37,213
a,
uh,

2277
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:41,840
a battler a warrior for a long time.
He's been very active and he's,

2278
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:44,840
he's very,
he's a very likable,

2279
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:46,940
Well honed machine right now.

2280
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:50,150
Whereas gsps been out of the loop for a 
solid three years.

2281
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:52,490
No competition at all.
However,

2282
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:53,623
he's been training the entire time.
So gsp is not a guy who sits around and 

2283
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:00,800
gets fat and it gets nothing done.
No,

2284
01:36:00,801 --> 01:36:05,000
he's constantly training.
But then again,

2285
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:08,930
he stopped because he was having memory 
issues and head injury.

2286
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,510
Yeah.
I mean he got hit.

2287
01:36:10,511 --> 01:36:14,270
He had 800 plus times over the course of
his ufc career,

2288
01:36:14,271 --> 01:36:15,104
hendricks fight.
He got hit in the head about 10,000 

2289
01:36:17,151 --> 01:36:17,984
times.
It seemed like he was a mess after that 

2290
01:36:19,281 --> 01:36:21,500
fight.
It's just been a mess.

2291
01:36:21,501 --> 01:36:22,334
After a few fights,
know carlos condit had kicked him and 

2292
01:36:25,221 --> 01:36:26,150
knocked him down.
I mean,

2293
01:36:26,151 --> 01:36:28,680
he's got some wars.
Matt serra knocked him out,

2294
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:29,990
you know,
it's weird.

2295
01:36:29,991 --> 01:36:33,140
It feels like gsp.
He's been the champion,

2296
01:36:33,141 --> 01:36:33,974
but it doesn't feel like he's doesn't 
have that champion respect for whatever 

2297
01:36:38,421 --> 01:36:38,930
reason.

2298
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:40,790
Well,
it's because his last fight with hendrix

2299
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:43,580
was super close.
We've been controversial.

2300
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:45,470
I did the fight companion.
No,

2301
01:36:45,471 --> 01:36:47,570
not to that fight.
I was there for that fight.

2302
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:51,800
Hendrick's not hendrick's last fight.
I'm talking about gsps last fight.

2303
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:52,663
Oh,
I was talking about [inaudible] being 

2304
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:55,120
no.
And,

2305
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:58,370
and henderson fight that one.
Henderson,

2306
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:01,880
that's when eddie bravo went full tower 
seven and he got super drunk.

2307
01:37:01,881 --> 01:37:03,680
Was worried the illuminati it was going 
to come and get us.

2308
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:05,420
Um,
but.

2309
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:09,110
And I said knockouts,
we're better than submissions I think.

2310
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:14,160
Well a lot of people like it.
But gsps last fight with johny hendricks

2311
01:37:14,811 --> 01:37:15,644
who's super close,
super close fight and gsp retired with 

2312
01:37:18,441 --> 01:37:19,250
the belt.
Yeah.

2313
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,990
I thought,
I thought he lost that fight.

2314
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:21,853
Just,
I mean a lot of people to a lot of 

2315
01:37:24,081 --> 01:37:24,914
people did.
Yeah.

2316
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:28,100
Either way.
It wasn't like this big victory.

2317
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:32,840
It's not like the way he beat down bj 
penn and stopped him and if he said then

2318
01:37:32,841 --> 01:37:34,010
I'm going to retire.

2319
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,690
I had a great time.
Thank you very much.

2320
01:37:35,691 --> 01:37:36,790
Everybody would blood.
Yeah,

2321
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:37,653
we love you george.
But instead it was a close fight and 

2322
01:37:39,611 --> 01:37:41,750
people are like,
no man,

2323
01:37:41,751 --> 01:37:42,584
I don't know if he got the belt.
Maybe maybe show went out with a loss 

2324
01:37:45,201 --> 01:37:46,510
there.
Who knows that,

2325
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:50,300
but don't you think brisbane doesn't 
have that championship type respect?

2326
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:51,493
He does not right noW.
And the reason he does not because he 

2327
01:37:53,631 --> 01:37:58,631
defended against henderson wasn't really
ranked that high and he really shouldn't

2328
01:37:58,891 --> 01:38:00,630
have got a title shot,
but it was a rematch,

2329
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:01,483
one of the most epic knockouts ever 
because henderson flatlined him and 

2330
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,960
punched him in the head while he was 
down and flew through the air.

2331
01:38:06,961 --> 01:38:07,794
And that's henderson's logo.
Now henderson's logo is literally a 

2332
01:38:10,501 --> 01:38:12,840
silhouette of his body flying through 
the air,

2333
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:16,460
ready to drop a punch down on bisping's 
unconscious body.

2334
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:17,670
Yeah.
So,

2335
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:20,820
and then who else has the defendant then
defended it?

2336
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:22,590
Um,
after he did that,

2337
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:23,680
he,
um,

2338
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:26,690
the faCt that,
you know,

2339
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:28,650
he's fighting gsp,
that's the next fight.

2340
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:29,663
So he defended it against henderson and 
then the next title defense is going to 

2341
01:38:33,251 --> 01:38:35,700
be against gsp.
He didn't have one before henderson.

2342
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:36,381
No,
no,

2343
01:38:36,381 --> 01:38:36,761
no,
no.

2344
01:38:36,761 --> 01:38:39,180
He won the title by beating luke 
rockhold.

2345
01:38:39,181 --> 01:38:39,600
Luke.
Yeah.

2346
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,440
He defended it against dan hendersOn.
Yeah.

2347
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:42,660
I was going to fight gsp piece.
So the,

2348
01:38:42,661 --> 01:38:43,494
I,
the thought is how is this guy getting 

2349
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,550
to fights that aren't right,
luke?

2350
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:52,680
You mean when you look at number one 
contender rockhold yoel romero,

2351
01:38:52,681 --> 01:38:54,870
who's the number one contender who was 
fucking terrifying.

2352
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:56,310
He shoUld get the shot.
Yes.

2353
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:57,790
Yo.
Well should get the shot.

2354
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:58,890
Yes.
Yeah.

2355
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:03,270
If you look at it in terms of who's the 
most viable contender,

2356
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:06,090
who's the guy that you would think would
be the most threatening guy?

2357
01:39:06,091 --> 01:39:08,370
Who's the guy that might be the 
uncrowned champion?

2358
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:12,180
You got to go with yoel romero.
It feels like ufc is.

2359
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,113
Um,
I think they're trying to find their 

2360
01:39:14,791 --> 01:39:16,470
way,
their footing a little bit with no.

2361
01:39:16,471 --> 01:39:18,510
Rhonda and conner.
No,

2362
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:19,703
so they're just going after that big.
What can we sell a bunch of paper 

2363
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:25,500
reviews for gsps a big name.
What?

2364
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:26,140
No,
no,

2365
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:26,441
no,
go.

2366
01:39:26,441 --> 01:39:27,090
Please go.
No,

2367
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:31,210
I was just gonna ask to what's happening
with connor and that whole fight with

2368
01:39:33,070 --> 01:39:33,903
no,
it has not been worked out yet so it's 

2369
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:36,423
not definitive,
but it's so much money involved that 

2370
01:39:37,831 --> 01:39:39,040
they think they're going to make it 
happen

2371
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:42,280
and that's.
And that's the ufc has got to come to an

2372
01:39:42,281 --> 01:39:45,880
agreement agreement or what did he get 
in trouble with doc though?

2373
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:48,940
Connor didn't convert for,
for I don't know,

2374
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,863
not saying something and coming out and 
saying something a while ago or get 

2375
01:39:53,051 --> 01:39:53,740
fined or something.

2376
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:55,960
He got fIned for the,
for the throwing the water bottle.

2377
01:39:56,210 --> 01:39:57,560
Monster energy thing.
Yeah.

2378
01:39:57,561 --> 01:39:59,830
They find them 150 grand and they 
dropped it down.

2379
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:00,783
I think they dropped it to like $35,000.
He said he'd never fight in vegas again 

2380
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:06,380
after that and so and they're like,
hey,

2381
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:11,230
you rely on your because there's going 
to go to New York.

2382
01:40:11,231 --> 01:40:14,170
It's debacle.
Did the big factors.

2383
01:40:14,171 --> 01:40:18,500
Another factor is also that the ufc was 
purchased by wme,

2384
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:20,133
that's an entertainment comedy,
entertainment companies going to try to 

2385
01:40:22,691 --> 01:40:24,460
put on the biggest show they could put 
on,

2386
01:40:24,730 --> 01:40:28,870
and that's not necessarily like the 
number one ranked contender fighting for

2387
01:40:28,871 --> 01:40:32,530
the title.
I think that it's an entertainment.

2388
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,750
I understand it's business,
I understand,

2389
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:37,690
but it is also,
there's,

2390
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:38,603
it's extremely important that you honor 
the hierarchy of champion and top 

2391
01:40:42,701 --> 01:40:46,000
challenge or I think that's critical 
that you work your way up.

2392
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,200
I mean,
you pay your dues,

2393
01:40:47,201 --> 01:40:48,460
you work your way up,
you.

2394
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:52,330
It's ranked on ability.
Yeah.

2395
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,313
So they're trying to manufacture big 
fights instead of letting big fights 

2396
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,180
killed themselves.
Evolve.

2397
01:40:58,410 --> 01:40:59,230
Yeah.
Bill,

2398
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:00,063
big fights evolve when you let a guy 
like yoel romero fight and he wins a 

2399
01:41:02,951 --> 01:41:04,600
beats.
Chris weidman by knockout,

2400
01:41:04,870 --> 01:41:07,390
and then if you fight michael bisping,
michael bisping,

2401
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:11,500
michael bisping bto el ramiro,
michael bisping becomes a superstar,

2402
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:13,300
you know,
and it's a tough fight.

2403
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:16,090
It's a real tough.
If yo el ramiro beats michael bisping,

2404
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:18,570
first of all,
he looks like a goddamn superhero.

2405
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,570
so that's easy to sell.
You know,

2406
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:24,430
you look at his highlight reel of 
smashing people to the fucking moon.

2407
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:25,623
He's a freak.
He's one of the greatest wrestlers it's 

2408
01:41:27,341 --> 01:41:28,320
ever competed.
You know,

2409
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:31,450
he,
he medaled in every single international

2410
01:41:31,451 --> 01:41:32,284
competition he entered.
He beat cael sanderson's when the 

2411
01:41:34,011 --> 01:41:35,050
greatest wrestlers of all time.

2412
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:38,380
He beat him twice.
He's just a freak of freaks.

2413
01:41:38,381 --> 01:41:43,210
Do you know yellow ramiro's to jamie?
Pull up a picture of yoel romero because

2414
01:41:43,211 --> 01:41:44,470
he doesn't even look real.
No,

2415
01:41:44,471 --> 01:41:45,281
he doesn't.
He's like,

2416
01:41:45,281 --> 01:41:46,840
one of those guys were like,
what is that?

2417
01:41:46,841 --> 01:41:49,420
That's a person.
Is that a real person or a cgi person?

2418
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:52,360
Just so jacked.
Who did he?

2419
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:55,450
Oh,
he beat a beat.

2420
01:41:55,451 --> 01:41:56,131
Everybody.
No,

2421
01:41:56,131 --> 01:41:56,411
no,
no,

2422
01:41:56,411 --> 01:41:58,300
but in thAt last one with the flying 
knee,

2423
01:41:58,330 --> 01:41:59,950
chris weidman.
oh my god.

2424
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:02,470
flat lined them because it seems like 
that whole fight,

2425
01:42:02,471 --> 01:42:06,200
he wasn't really doing much to get the 
fuck out.

2426
01:42:06,610 --> 01:42:10,190
That's a real person.
But he did this fun.

2427
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:13,100
This fight against,
uh,

2428
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:18,570
chris weidman was sorta like hanging in 
the balance and then he did some flying.

2429
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,950
Hit him in the side of the head.
Where did that come from?

2430
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:27,460
Pull up that video that you all ramiro 
kaos my chris weidman.

2431
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:28,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

2432
01:42:28,970 --> 01:42:31,060
There's an animated gif that.
oh,

2433
01:42:31,061 --> 01:42:32,830
here we go.
Go to the video.

2434
01:42:32,831 --> 01:42:35,590
It's fucking insane.
Like,

2435
01:42:35,591 --> 01:42:36,930
look,
even how he.

2436
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:40,750
He fucking flies when he landed this.
Look how he turns around already.

2437
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:42,760
Atlanta punches.
Here it goes.

2438
01:42:42,761 --> 01:42:44,590
Watch this.
Boom.

2439
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:46,810
How recent was this fan?
A couple of months ago.

2440
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:48,900
I was in Australia.
I don't think I saw down there.

2441
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:53,860
He's just a freak and it cut the biggest
gash in the side of his head.

2442
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,510
Yeah.
See if you get a clear video of it.

2443
01:42:56,860 --> 01:43:01,030
Superman fly from like another angle,
but he's just a.

2444
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,880
Yeah,
a freak of nature and science.

2445
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:04,773
That's,
that's,

2446
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:06,670
that's cape.
He's capable of.

2447
01:43:06,671 --> 01:43:11,671
That was the second.
But like the amount of force behind that

2448
01:43:11,711 --> 01:43:14,890
is just flying through the air and 
that's like so irregular to.

2449
01:43:14,891 --> 01:43:19,030
It's kinda like the way like chuck with 
dell used to hit like real irregular,

2450
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:23,980
like a flying knee to of well he's just 
so.

2451
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:25,083
He's so explosive.
So his ability to close the distance is 

2452
01:43:28,091 --> 01:43:28,924
stunning.
Sometimes people aren't prepared for it 

2453
01:43:30,910 --> 01:43:34,090
because he's such an athlete,
but in that fight it didn't feel like he

2454
01:43:34,091 --> 01:43:36,370
had been doing much.
You know what I mean?

2455
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,470
I feel like he was just kinda like,
god,

2456
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:41,840
what is he going to like get off?
It was a close fight for sure.

2457
01:43:41,841 --> 01:43:44,530
And then all of a sudden,
just out of nowhere.

2458
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:46,930
Yeah.
So whether or not,

2459
01:43:46,931 --> 01:43:47,764
I mean if,
whether or not michael bisping can beat 

2460
01:43:49,811 --> 01:43:50,710
him,
like who knows?

2461
01:43:50,711 --> 01:43:52,970
But he's got to give them a chance.
Oh,

2462
01:43:52,971 --> 01:43:55,250
I know he does.
He's going to give you all a chance.

2463
01:43:55,251 --> 01:43:56,390
Yeah.
So it seems,

2464
01:43:56,930 --> 01:43:59,420
I don't know.
It doesn't seem that life isn't fair.

2465
01:43:59,421 --> 01:44:02,570
Who cares?
but it doesn't seem fair that it's gsp.

2466
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:03,500
Well,
the thing is,

2467
01:44:03,501 --> 01:44:06,320
is it a sport or is it entertainment?

2468
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:09,540
I mean you just trying to put on a 
spectacle or is it a sport?

2469
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:11,870
It's a sport.
If you're going to have the world series

2470
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:16,580
people play this guy to play that guy 
and then it gets to the world series.

2471
01:44:16,581 --> 01:44:18,340
And here's the world series folks,
and this is,

2472
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:21,980
we've had all this whole season we've 
been building to this moment and this is

2473
01:44:21,981 --> 01:44:22,814
the hierarchy and it's still huge now if
it's just to show you the three of them 

2474
01:44:26,841 --> 01:44:28,160
in there,
put your oil in there too.

2475
01:44:28,161 --> 01:44:31,930
With gsp and michael bisping.
I was saying all three.

2476
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,360
I was saying that they should have 
because you're dealing with a guy in gsp

2477
01:44:35,361 --> 01:44:36,930
has been out for a long time.
Yeah.

2478
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:39,470
Having fight nick diaz,
he's been out for a long time to.

2479
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,560
Neither one of them is ranked.
They'll both those guys before,

2480
01:44:42,561 --> 01:44:43,230
right?
Yeah.

2481
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:44,060
I have a rematch.

2482
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:45,200
Yeah.
That's the fight.

2483
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:46,690
That would get a ton.
A ton of paper.

2484
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:50,150
People would let people love diaz.
They love him.

2485
01:44:50,151 --> 01:44:52,730
I don't think people even know how much 
people love them.

2486
01:44:52,731 --> 01:44:56,920
I don't even know if the ufc knows how 
big of a star nick and nate are.

2487
01:44:56,950 --> 01:44:58,180
Yeah,
yeah,

2488
01:44:58,340 --> 01:44:59,690
yeah.
Sacramento,

2489
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:01,100
California.
But bisping would like,

2490
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:04,040
oh,
fucking smoking pot check.

2491
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:09,220
Like fucking promoting use guys like do 
crazy insane cardio.

2492
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:14,490
Like bisping's kinda saying cardio.
The diaz brothers have cardio.

2493
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:18,980
Yeah.
Nick has swam back from alcatraz five.

2494
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:21,410
Whoa.
Five times.

2495
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:23,600
I said twice once and he corrected me 
online.

2496
01:45:23,601 --> 01:45:28,520
He said five now race ever.
They compete in triathlons all the time.

2497
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:29,290
Yeah.

2498
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:29,690
You know,
my,

2499
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:31,360
you know,
my dad actually,

2500
01:45:31,361 --> 01:45:33,370
uh,
he was in a plane crash,

2501
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:36,370
uh,
in his early twenties and it was off san

2502
01:45:36,371 --> 01:45:40,270
francisco and he to swim a couple miles 
in that water will survive.

2503
01:45:40,330 --> 01:45:41,620
Yeah.
Holy shit.

2504
01:45:41,621 --> 01:45:43,150
He crashed into the water.
Yeah.

2505
01:45:43,151 --> 01:45:44,460
Yeah.
Most people don't know that it's,

2506
01:45:45,030 --> 01:45:46,570
it's,
it's pretty crazy heat.

2507
01:45:46,571 --> 01:45:47,370
And,
and I'm going to,

2508
01:45:47,370 --> 01:45:49,480
I'm going to butcher the details,
but uh,

2509
01:45:49,570 --> 01:45:50,051
just,
you know,

2510
01:45:50,051 --> 01:45:50,910
from growing up.

2511
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:54,580
exactly.
Um,

2512
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:55,660
but what happened

2513
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:56,493
was he was in the army and uh,
it was right around the time the korean 

2514
01:45:59,801 --> 01:46:02,650
war was starting and he was,
they were flying,

2515
01:46:02,651 --> 01:46:03,484
they were doing a routine flight or 
something and they had to crash land in 

2516
01:46:07,211 --> 01:46:12,211
the ocean and it was getting night.
And I believed,

2517
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:17,000
I believed the pilot died and I could be
wrong on that.

2518
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:20,710
The pilot died,
but his other guy he was with survived.

2519
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:25,740
So him and him and this other guy,
they were swimming to shore and they got

2520
01:46:26,261 --> 01:46:27,094
split up because it was getting dark at 
night and so then now they're swimming 

2521
01:46:29,921 --> 01:46:32,740
alone and anyone who knows,
you know san francisco is.

2522
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,700
Yeah,
definitely.

2523
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:37,870
Jaws.
Water dumped him,

2524
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:38,470
dum,
dum,

2525
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:38,920
dum,
dum.

2526
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:40,160
That's where they breed.
Yeah.

2527
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:41,141
Early.
Yeah.

2528
01:46:41,141 --> 01:46:42,940
Great.
Whites breed in northern California.

2529
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,350
There's like a nesting ground up there.
Yeah.

2530
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:47,490
Fuck on now.
Or you want to crash a plane?

2531
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:50,130
They're not where you want to swim from 
five times either

2532
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,510
in your underwear.
I know,

2533
01:46:51,511 --> 01:46:53,730
that's crazy.
I guess I've heard of that race,

2534
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:55,230
but yeah,
that's crazy.

2535
01:46:55,231 --> 01:46:56,064
You've done that?
Yeah.

2536
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,550
Wow.
So you're down at a swim two miles.

2537
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:00,720
Yeah,
something like that.

2538
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:03,810
It could have been more.
I mean fuck,

2539
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,420
but it was a long for a couple hundred 
yards.

2540
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:07,433
Yes,
it means it.

2541
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:09,330
I started looking for a log to hang 
onto,

2542
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:11,413
I think.
I think your dad has property in Oregon 

2543
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:15,090
or a house or something,
does he?

2544
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:16,133
Not?
That I know of.

2545
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:19,330
We've got a ranch up in northern 
California,

2546
01:47:19,331 --> 01:47:20,920
is at a ranch for a long time.
I've been,

2547
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:22,200
uh,
east of,

2548
01:47:23,510 --> 01:47:24,450
uh,
east of redding.

2549
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:25,343
Oh,
okay.

2550
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:28,170
It's in a vr.
No,

2551
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:30,870
bernie is and that sort of area up 
there.

2552
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:34,590
And then like lake shasta sort area and 
I think,

2553
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:39,450
I think we have a big saw mill right 
where I live.

2554
01:47:39,451 --> 01:47:41,450
Weyerhaeuser.
I think he,

2555
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:42,120
this could be wrong.

2556
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:42,953
I think he worked there.
Your dad worked at the warehouse or saw 

2557
01:47:45,820 --> 01:47:47,120
mill?
Uh,

2558
01:47:47,121 --> 01:47:48,170
I don't know.
I mean,

2559
01:47:49,010 --> 01:47:49,860
look,
there's a lot of.

2560
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:50,933
I've heard,
I've heard crazy thing I've heard 

2561
01:47:52,291 --> 01:47:55,260
crazier.
Let's see if this is crazy.

2562
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:56,123
Maybe as on dmt.
How often do you get to hang out with 

2563
01:47:59,071 --> 01:48:00,510
them?
Uh,

2564
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:02,640
well I've been busy a lot.
You know,

2565
01:48:02,670 --> 01:48:03,503
I was gone for six months in Australia 
and China and then before that I was 

2566
01:48:08,611 --> 01:48:10,800
working on fast and then before that it 
was on a movie.

2567
01:48:10,801 --> 01:48:12,480
Uh,
not as much as I'd like,

2568
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:15,920
but he is turning 87 this year and uh,
that's,

2569
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:16,793
I'm taking some time off to really feel 
like that's an important point in time 

2570
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:22,800
in my life to try to be around him.
Yeah.

2571
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:24,233
Ed seven,
now that's old just happens all the 

2572
01:48:28,111 --> 01:48:29,190
sudden.
You're 87.

2573
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:30,730
That's almost 90.
I didn't know.

2574
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:32,880
It doesn't feel like clint eastwood 
would be almost 90.

2575
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:33,691
Yeah,
I know.

2576
01:48:33,691 --> 01:48:35,940
I would've thought 70.
It's a strange.

2577
01:48:36,150 --> 01:48:39,690
Wow.
He's because he was told he had you when

2578
01:48:39,691 --> 01:48:43,620
he was like in his fifties damn son.
Yeah.

2579
01:48:44,890 --> 01:48:46,060
Just getting shit done.
No,

2580
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:47,610
he's.
Well,

2581
01:48:47,610 --> 01:48:48,930
I got it.
I have a sister.

2582
01:48:48,931 --> 01:48:52,280
I have a sister who's 19.
She just turned 20 no next.

2583
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:53,123
Wow.
He was getting it done even in their 

2584
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,070
sixties.
Yeah.

2585
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:58,210
Slaying it.

2586
01:49:00,530 --> 01:49:01,860
Ooh,
I get it.

2587
01:49:01,930 --> 01:49:02,731
Yeah.
Yeah.

2588
01:49:02,731 --> 01:49:06,240
So he was married to that girl who was a
newscaster or something.

2589
01:49:06,241 --> 01:49:07,920
Right.
And then they did a reality show.

2590
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:10,440
Well she did a reality show.
Yeah,

2591
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:12,420
he wasn't,
he wasn't.

2592
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:13,950
He didn't do it at all.
No.

2593
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:17,790
He was in no episodes at all yet.
She might have gotten them into it.

2594
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:19,680
I wasn't forced to episode.
Yeah,

2595
01:49:19,730 --> 01:49:21,240
I remember that was going on.
I was like,

2596
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:23,140
huh,
this one,

2597
01:49:23,141 --> 01:49:26,580
I ain't going to work now.
That wasn't his.

2598
01:49:26,610 --> 01:49:29,820
It wasn't his thing.
Was he married to the.

2599
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:34,140
Who was the woman in sondra locke?
Every which way.

2600
01:49:34,141 --> 01:49:35,370
But yeah,
never,

2601
01:49:35,371 --> 01:49:36,151
never married.
Oh,

2602
01:49:36,151 --> 01:49:36,984
they weren't.
Okay.

2603
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:39,900
She sued the shit out of him though.
When he broke up with her,

2604
01:49:40,630 --> 01:49:44,580
there was like a crazy store that he was
like blocking her film projects.

2605
01:49:44,910 --> 01:49:46,470
She was trying to claim that and he was 
like,

2606
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,160
what a.
Yeah,

2607
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,000
I don't think he has time to deal with 
that.

2608
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:51,213
Those kind of.
Well she had gotten some sort of a deal 

2609
01:49:53,830 --> 01:49:57,100
when they broke up to do like some film 
projects.

2610
01:49:57,101 --> 01:49:58,680
It was like part of like the,
you know,

2611
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:01,410
separation deal.
And uh,

2612
01:50:01,570 --> 01:50:02,403
she was claiming that he was somehow or 
another blocking them if I remember the 

2613
01:50:05,111 --> 01:50:07,100
story correctly.
Well,

2614
01:50:07,730 --> 01:50:09,460
I've been like a woman's going to get 
that.

2615
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:11,320
He did.
He worked at the pulp mill.

2616
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:13,030
Oh wow.
Boy.

2617
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:15,360
But that's what you're reading this 
wikipedia.

2618
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:17,710
Yeah,
he did it.

2619
01:50:17,870 --> 01:50:19,360
Me be my.
I'll ask him.

2620
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:22,030
I'll ask real bro.
It's on the internet.

2621
01:50:22,031 --> 01:50:23,950
It's got to be real.
I think he did.

2622
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:24,993
Look,
I don't know if you know about 

2623
01:50:25,331 --> 01:50:28,540
wikipedia,
but this is why I know it's real because

2624
01:50:28,541 --> 01:50:31,360
anyone can enter in information and edit
it.

2625
01:50:31,650 --> 01:50:33,100
Right.
That's crazy.

2626
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:35,820
So it's so,
so 100 percent solid.

2627
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:36,653
So solid.
Why would anybody put something that 

2628
01:50:39,161 --> 01:50:42,190
wasn't true?
If I think wikipedia is still says Brian

2629
01:50:42,190 --> 01:50:43,360
Collins,
my brother really?

2630
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:46,480
Who somebody might have changed it,
but I left it there for ever.

2631
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:48,310
Yeah,
well he could.

2632
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:50,920
He's as jacked as you.
He was almost dragged as me.

2633
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:56,290
Clothes.
He was flexing close call flex light.

2634
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,480
Crazy.
Silly goose.

2635
01:50:58,570 --> 01:51:02,350
That guy's the best to go hunting with 
[inaudible] for five days.

2636
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:06,820
Like we were like the last time we went 
it was just nothing but jokes.

2637
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,790
Just constant laughter.
He's because he's like,

2638
01:51:10,150 --> 01:51:14,050
he's the best at a captive audience.
Like if you're stuck in the car,

2639
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:16,810
he's going to make us.
He's the guy that make make a scene.

2640
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,460
oh,
well he's just funny man.

2641
01:51:18,461 --> 01:51:19,660
He's a.
He's like,

2642
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:22,420
just,
I'm not funny that way the way he is.

2643
01:51:22,421 --> 01:51:25,150
He's like a,
just a natural showman wound.

2644
01:51:25,151 --> 01:51:26,050
Silly person.

2645
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,100
Always silly.
And the first time I took him to Montana

2646
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:32,800
we went hunting with rinella.
Like it was just,

2647
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:37,000
it was six days of gut busting howling.
Laughter does.

2648
01:51:37,010 --> 01:51:39,880
Does.
Steve seems more like dry though.

2649
01:51:40,210 --> 01:51:40,880
It's funny.
Does.

2650
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:43,720
He was funny guy too.
HE's got a couple of pops in them,

2651
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:47,890
funny dude,
but collin had this character called the

2652
01:51:47,891 --> 01:51:51,940
ravine comer and he couldn't.
They wouldn't put it anywhere.

2653
01:51:51,941 --> 01:51:54,160
They wouldn't release the footage,
but they filmed it.

2654
01:51:54,490 --> 01:51:55,323
It was him who was doing this character 
of a guy who finds every time he sees 

2655
01:51:57,580 --> 01:51:58,413
ravine ravinia has to come,
so he runs towards it counts like 

2656
01:52:02,591 --> 01:52:03,424
pulling his pants down and he's 
screaming that he's shooting loads into 

2657
01:52:06,971 --> 01:52:07,990
this ravine.
I mean,

2658
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:11,800
I'm not doing it any justice because 
he's like way over the top.

2659
01:52:11,801 --> 01:52:13,720
It's like,
oh fuck.

2660
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:18,820
Like he would just,
whenever you'd see like sort of a valley

2661
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:21,310
who would have to pretend he was jerking
off into it.

2662
01:52:23,290 --> 01:52:25,750
I'm telling you,
it seems so ridiculous,

2663
01:52:25,751 --> 01:52:26,470
but you know,
you're,

2664
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:27,303
you're,
I think everybody's done that before 

2665
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:31,180
you're talking into a ravine.
Oh yeah,

2666
01:52:31,181 --> 01:52:32,740
of course.
But when you're little,

2667
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:35,350
you know,
you get up at 5:30 in the morning,

2668
01:52:35,351 --> 01:52:36,820
it's dark out,
you're freezing.

2669
01:52:36,821 --> 01:52:38,920
He's the guy.
He's just mAking everybody laugh.

2670
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:39,970
Yeah,
that's what he,

2671
01:52:40,030 --> 01:52:41,920
that's what he mentioned.
There was something weird about that,

2672
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:42,754
like in the woods and you're waking up 
super early or going surfing super 

2673
01:52:45,411 --> 01:52:46,010
early,

2674
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,020
you're sort of delirious and yeah,
and you're like,

2675
01:52:48,470 --> 01:52:49,303
what the fuck are we doing?
Why are we putting ourselves through 

2676
01:52:50,601 --> 01:52:51,860
this shit?
and then you know,

2677
01:52:51,861 --> 01:52:52,694
you,
you obviously do your activity or 

2678
01:52:53,871 --> 01:52:55,730
whatever it is and you're happy you did 
it,

2679
01:52:55,731 --> 01:52:57,120
but it's a,
it's,

2680
01:52:57,310 --> 01:52:58,880
it's a weird delirium.
Our,

2681
01:52:59,040 --> 01:52:59,873
there's also some weird thoughts that go
through your mind when you're sleep 

2682
01:53:02,161 --> 01:53:04,820
deprived that don't ordinarily go 
through your mind.

2683
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:07,380
So one of the reasons,
like some writers on purpose,

2684
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:10,200
we'll wait until like really late at 
night until they write.

2685
01:53:10,201 --> 01:53:12,210
Like the writers that wrote for news 
radio,

2686
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:13,053
those sitcoms to be on,
they would wait until like two or three 

2687
01:53:15,361 --> 01:53:16,740
in the morning before they started 
writing.

2688
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:20,040
They would just stay up and get silly 
and joke around those who simply

2689
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:21,133
creative.
It can be someone that's usually when I 

2690
01:53:23,601 --> 01:53:26,300
make a post that I wake up in the 
morning anD read and be like,

2691
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:27,800
oh,
why did I say that?

2692
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:29,690
I did that the other day.
I was in New York.

2693
01:53:29,691 --> 01:53:32,390
I was sat at a bar and we were,
we were,

2694
01:53:32,391 --> 01:53:33,830
you know,
we were all celebrating sort of,

2695
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,153
we were fast and furious stuff and uh,
I wake up in the morning and there's me 

2696
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:39,433
screaming,
you know,

2697
01:53:39,450 --> 01:53:44,450
singing tina turner at the top of my 
lungs as long what's love got to do it.

2698
01:53:44,481 --> 01:53:46,090
Oh no.
Oh my god.

2699
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:49,430
who is out of context.
It's a story.

2700
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:52,930
It was so not part of any of the story,
you know,

2701
01:53:53,090 --> 01:53:54,430
it was just.
Yeah.

2702
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:56,153
Yeah.

2703
01:53:57,110 --> 01:53:59,120
Drive in fast and furious.
Yeah.

2704
01:53:59,230 --> 01:54:01,520
Do you drive,
did you drive for real or did they.

2705
01:54:01,670 --> 01:54:02,780
I was at work.
We don't,

2706
01:54:02,781 --> 01:54:03,350
we don't,
we don't,

2707
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:04,183
we don't do a lot of the heavy lifting.
The heavy lifting is done by a 

2708
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:09,200
professional stunt guys.
It's a,

2709
01:54:09,530 --> 01:54:11,990
yeah,
it's a big liability first off,

2710
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:14,360
you know,
and in those stents or I mean they do an

2711
01:54:14,361 --> 01:54:17,180
incredible job of keeping everything in 
camera,

2712
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:18,980
uh,
or at least a lot of it,

2713
01:54:18,981 --> 01:54:19,330
you know,
it's,

2714
01:54:19,330 --> 01:54:20,163
they can't do,
have cars flying over some marines and 

2715
01:54:21,831 --> 01:54:25,370
camera and stuff,
but they do a really good job of,

2716
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:29,150
of utilizing the stunt drivers talents 
and keeping a lot of stuff.

2717
01:54:29,290 --> 01:54:31,400
You drive at all.
Is it ever you driving?

2718
01:54:31,401 --> 01:54:32,234
Yeah.
You have to like pull up to a thing 

2719
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:34,041
then,
you know,

2720
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:35,750
do a couple of lines or seeing or 
something.

2721
01:54:35,751 --> 01:54:37,940
But you're not doing,
you're not doing the

2722
01:54:38,230 --> 01:54:39,890
gone sideways around a corner.
Yeah.

2723
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:42,280
You know what always drives me nuts with
those movies,

2724
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:47,520
they crushed these awesome cars.
They take these awesome classic cars and

2725
01:54:48,041 --> 01:54:50,430
smash him like,
nah,

2726
01:54:50,670 --> 01:54:53,660
you know,
700 or something were destroyed and then

2727
01:54:53,670 --> 01:54:56,500
making this 700 cars.
What in the fuck man,

2728
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:57,513
it's like the dukes of hazard,
like one of the biggest bummers about 

2729
01:54:59,141 --> 01:54:59,974
the dukes of hazard is watching these 
old chargers slam nose first into the 

2730
01:55:03,281 --> 01:55:05,650
ground and then pretending that things.
Okay.

2731
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:06,893
Yeah,
yeah,

2732
01:55:07,070 --> 01:55:07,903
yeah.
There are some of that jumping out or 

2733
01:55:08,990 --> 01:55:12,400
drive it off the snow mountain or 
something.

2734
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:16,550
Yeah,
there's some stuff still still cars,

2735
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:18,013
but you know,
that's funny because you said 700 cars 

2736
01:55:19,601 --> 01:55:23,140
were ruined.
I shot an iphone in slow motion one time

2737
01:55:23,141 --> 01:55:25,270
and people were saying how wasteful I 
was.

2738
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:28,600
I'm like,
have you ever seen a movie?

2739
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:33,850
Do not kick.
That's wasteful of what gigabytes?

2740
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:34,640
No,
I know.

2741
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:37,270
So tHe phone I wasted.
Somebody could use that phone.

2742
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:40,550
Don't you know,
you remember the first shot and I shot.

2743
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:43,710
I was just shooting.
I shot with an arrow.

2744
01:55:43,711 --> 01:55:44,041
Yeah,
yeah.

2745
01:55:44,041 --> 01:55:44,874
Oh,
an airfoil.

2746
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:46,830
Wasted a phone shot.
Some here.

2747
01:55:46,831 --> 01:55:49,590
We shot some in that back studio for 
unbox therapy.

2748
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:50,913
Set up some iphones because they had,
they came out with some new glass that 

2749
01:55:54,361 --> 01:55:55,194
was back when a 90 pound factor to blew 
right through that thing that people 

2750
01:55:59,491 --> 01:56:00,750
were like,
that's so wasteful.

2751
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:02,740
You could given that to somebody just 
like,

2752
01:56:02,840 --> 01:56:06,510
oh my opinion about every.
go watch a movie,

2753
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:09,030
you know,
700 classic cars.

2754
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:11,390
Yeah.
I mean,

2755
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:16,570
I mean some are pintos or whatever,
you know.

2756
01:56:17,310 --> 01:56:19,050
I don't know what you'd call them.
Classic.

2757
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:20,490
They might be old,
but the warning,

2758
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:23,070
all the vin diesel driving car now.
Okay.

2759
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:26,280
How about the shooting?
Did you guys actually shoot guns?

2760
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:30,220
Because that's not out there somewhere.
You blank blank ammunition.

2761
01:56:30,221 --> 01:56:32,130
That's pretty standard on movies.
Okay.

2762
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:34,020
Yeah.
Because you had some shooting scenes.

2763
01:56:34,021 --> 01:56:34,461
Yeah,
yeah,

2764
01:56:34,461 --> 01:56:35,131
yeah.
No,

2765
01:56:35,131 --> 01:56:38,940
I was told that when you do a scene with
a gun and blank ammunition,

2766
01:56:38,941 --> 01:56:41,010
you're still not supposed to point at 
the actor,

2767
01:56:41,011 --> 01:56:41,730
you know.
No,

2768
01:56:41,730 --> 01:56:42,563
no.
I mean if anyone's got good gun 

2769
01:56:43,441 --> 01:56:44,290
discipline,
you know,

2770
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:47,070
I mean that's how I grew up is know 
good,

2771
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:47,881
done discipline,
you know,

2772
01:56:47,881 --> 01:56:49,680
muzzled down.
It's always.

2773
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:51,920
I mean like even in a scene where you're
shooting.

2774
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:53,351
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2775
01:56:53,351 --> 01:56:56,370
You want to sort of offset it.
Especially if it's close.

2776
01:56:56,371 --> 01:56:59,340
I mean they do testing and stuff first 
to see and they'll tell you,

2777
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:00,990
hey,
you can't pass this line.

2778
01:57:01,290 --> 01:57:02,123
You know,
if you're walking up and you're gonna 

2779
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:05,310
pull a gun on somebody that,
you know,

2780
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:08,250
we don't want you to go past this line 
or so.

2781
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:09,750
Um,
and then obviously,

2782
01:57:09,751 --> 01:57:10,560
you know,
hey,

2783
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:11,393
can you not aim it directly their head,
they'll find like a good point for you 

2784
01:57:14,191 --> 01:57:17,160
to aim and that that's with the camera a
little bit.

2785
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:18,083
I had heard that that happened after 
brendan league got killed and movie the 

2786
01:57:20,161 --> 01:57:21,290
crow.
Yeah.

2787
01:57:21,460 --> 01:57:24,160
And that was a bad one.
It had real ammo in there,

2788
01:57:24,161 --> 01:57:24,950
right?
No,

2789
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:29,510
there was like some of it.
Got it.

2790
01:57:29,570 --> 01:57:32,130
What happens is sometimes what happens 
is sometimes you know,

2791
01:57:32,131 --> 01:57:33,720
and even in these airbags,
the same,

2792
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:34,613
same sort of stuff,
they had all these recall on these 

2793
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:39,240
airbags is what happens is these blanks,
you know,

2794
01:57:39,241 --> 01:57:40,074
sometimes they'll,
they'll bunch up together over time if 

2795
01:57:42,381 --> 01:57:44,070
it's an old blank that gunpowder.

2796
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:46,370
So it,
it can harden.

2797
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:47,303
Oh.
And then it can shoot like a projection 

2798
01:57:49,410 --> 01:57:52,320
of a couple of shotgun pellets.
Wow.

2799
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:53,213
And it just penetrated at that spot and 
killed them crazy as a 44 magnum I 

2800
01:57:57,421 --> 01:58:00,240
think.
So it was a ton of power behind it.

2801
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:02,310
Crazy.
Yeah.

2802
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:03,933
Good.
Yeah.

2803
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:07,260
So now they just pointed to the side.
It would have like fight scenes.

2804
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:09,223
Do you have to do fight scenes?
Like especially you have a martial arts 

2805
01:58:12,241 --> 01:58:14,040
background,
she have you do scenes.

2806
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:16,380
Yeah,
I didn't do the,

2807
01:58:16,381 --> 01:58:18,900
there wasn't a terrible amount of a 
fight.

2808
01:58:18,901 --> 01:58:20,820
Slammed,
slammed against the wall.

2809
01:58:21,700 --> 01:58:24,210
I get slapped around a little bit in 
this one,

2810
01:58:24,690 --> 01:58:25,860
but to assure,
you know,

2811
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:27,660
in other films,
I love doing that stuff.

2812
01:58:27,661 --> 01:58:29,220
That's the fun stuff.
Especially,

2813
01:58:29,230 --> 01:58:30,063
you know,
because because you get to hang with 

2814
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:31,463
the,
you know,

2815
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:33,080
some of the coolest guys on sets,
all the,

2816
01:58:33,090 --> 01:58:34,450
all the stunt guys,
you know,

2817
01:58:34,670 --> 01:58:36,050
they're all,
you know,

2818
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:37,560
likeminded people,
all,

2819
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:39,030
you know,
martial art background,

2820
01:58:39,031 --> 01:58:40,350
guys.
Um,

2821
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:43,990
and so you're choreographing all day 
working that out and then you get on set

2822
01:58:43,991 --> 01:58:45,310
and you're doing it or you're,
you're,

2823
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:46,173
you're,
you're doing it with them because they 

2824
01:58:46,901 --> 01:58:48,210
might be playing the,
you know,

2825
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:51,490
villa number seven or something.
So then you're,

2826
01:58:51,491 --> 01:58:53,410
you've already sort of got a shorthand 
with them and your,

2827
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,060
that's,
that's the fun stuff.

2828
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:55,953
That's cool.
It's way better than dealing with a 

2829
01:58:57,041 --> 01:58:59,230
difficult actor or something.
Do you ever do that?

2830
01:59:00,610 --> 01:59:02,260
yeah,
it was the worst.

2831
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:03,110
Oh,
come on.

2832
01:59:03,110 --> 01:59:07,030
You're not going to get something else.

2833
01:59:09,740 --> 01:59:11,100
Let's,
you know,

2834
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:12,730
uh,
you'll,

2835
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:16,630
you'll get me in trouble like sky's.
Oh,

2836
01:59:16,631 --> 01:59:17,620
that's right.
Oh yeah,

2837
01:59:17,621 --> 01:59:18,880
that's what I hear.
Yeah.

2838
01:59:19,330 --> 01:59:20,163
I thought it was torpedoes,
but that might just be lips and louis 

2839
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:25,830
slips yet in the scene.
Uh,

2840
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:29,570
the rock picks him up and slams.
It,

2841
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:33,580
holds them against the wall.
And was that real?

2842
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:38,410
It's real.
It's real with some assistance.

2843
01:59:38,411 --> 01:59:40,180
There's some movie magic,
but he's,

2844
01:59:40,230 --> 01:59:41,120
he's a big guy.
I mean,

2845
01:59:41,121 --> 01:59:41,954
it's real.
You would have dropped him and choked 

2846
01:59:43,361 --> 01:59:45,910
him out.
That dude is so jacked.

2847
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:48,820
He took a photo of him after a workout 
the other day and I'm like,

2848
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:50,590
why?
He's huge.

2849
01:59:50,591 --> 01:59:54,850
So disciplined to 4:00 AM.
Does he,

2850
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:57,310
is when you're on set with him,
was he just always doing that?

2851
01:59:57,311 --> 01:59:58,144
Like,
what's his deal?

2852
01:59:58,150 --> 02:00:00,430
He's just extremely disciplined guy.
Um,

2853
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:01,570
you know,
I got a lot of respect for him.

2854
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:02,740
He's uh,
he's,

2855
02:00:02,741 --> 02:00:05,950
he knows what he wants and he is going 
to get it like he's not.

2856
02:00:05,980 --> 02:00:06,910
There is no,
no,

2857
02:00:06,911 --> 02:00:07,744
he is taken it down.
He's making movie after movie after 

2858
02:00:10,661 --> 02:00:11,980
movie.
He's going to go do it.

2859
02:00:12,370 --> 02:00:14,800
He's a,
he eats religiously.

2860
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:17,290
He's got to get these meals are,
you know,

2861
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:18,453
which is,
I love doing a meal prep stuff because 

2862
02:00:20,711 --> 02:00:21,730
it's great.
It makes his life.

2863
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:22,980
One less thing to think about.
Right?

2864
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:25,860
Um,
but he's very religious with it.

2865
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:29,920
Fuck a dog that.
Look at that piece of meat.

2866
02:00:29,950 --> 02:00:32,100
He's more jack now than he's ever had 
his life.

2867
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:35,210
I think he's 44,
44,

2868
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:36,850
46 or something.
Yeah,

2869
02:00:37,390 --> 02:00:39,370
just crazy.
Uber jacked.

2870
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:41,620
Yeah.
He's continuing to get more and more.

2871
02:00:41,621 --> 02:00:45,460
Jack still still putting in the work.
He's not done getting jacked.

2872
02:00:45,461 --> 02:00:46,960
He's,
he's keeping pumping it.

2873
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:48,490
He's keeping a gun.
It's just a.

2874
02:00:48,550 --> 02:00:49,383
When you see his schedule and his 
workload and then there's always some 

2875
02:00:52,031 --> 02:00:55,320
new projects doing on doing a tv show 
and he's doing this.

2876
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:57,580
Fuck.
Does he have time?

2877
02:00:57,581 --> 02:01:00,820
And he's hosting this award show and 
he's like doing something for the troops

2878
02:01:00,821 --> 02:01:02,050
and then he's doing this.
Moving.

2879
02:01:02,710 --> 02:01:05,860
Finishing up.
That movement is like how I tell you the

2880
02:01:05,861 --> 02:01:07,480
travel is what kills me.
I know you probably,

2881
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:10,030
you've been in show business for all 
longer than all of us,

2882
02:01:10,031 --> 02:01:10,864
you know,
um,

2883
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:12,900
and uh,
the travel is what kills you.

2884
02:01:12,970 --> 02:01:15,580
WRite these long flights and then jet 
lag and then trying to,

2885
02:01:15,590 --> 02:01:18,550
you got to go hit the gym and I did a 
podcast yesterday.

2886
02:01:18,551 --> 02:01:20,140
MY brain just wouldn't fire,
right.

2887
02:01:20,170 --> 02:01:21,003
It takes to me like a day or two who had
just flown in from buffalo and it just 

2888
02:01:24,941 --> 02:01:28,060
takes a day or two like for your brain 
to like rethink.

2889
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:31,330
Like today I feel normal,
but yesterday I just was like foggy with

2890
02:01:31,331 --> 02:01:32,164
you.
I haven't tried it but I keep hearing 

2891
02:01:33,521 --> 02:01:34,354
about the,
what you're supposed to do with the 

2892
02:01:36,731 --> 02:01:37,564
light for the jet lag because like the 
simulation of light wherever you're at 

2893
02:01:41,631 --> 02:01:42,810
and then they have,
you know,

2894
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:46,820
you're supposed to put on the eye thing.
Like when it's supposed to get dark,

2895
02:01:46,821 --> 02:01:48,740
like say you're flying into the light,
you're flying,

2896
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:49,603
you know,
going away those covers and stimulate 

2897
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:54,260
wherever you want with whoever you're 
supposed to end up.

2898
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:56,480
And that really supposed to help with 
jet lag.

2899
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:57,433
I was reading a podcast about Alaska,
but people that hunt in Alaska and then 

2900
02:02:00,171 --> 02:02:04,190
when you go up there in the summer and 
you get two hours of a podcast,

2901
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:07,130
did I say reading what the fuck is wrong
with me?

2902
02:02:07,131 --> 02:02:10,100
Why do I keep saying that?
That's the second time on this podcast.

2903
02:02:10,101 --> 02:02:10,934
I've never said it before.
Maybe I'm still not really recovered 

2904
02:02:12,531 --> 02:02:14,060
from buffalo.
I'm in denial.

2905
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:15,613
Excuse me.
I was listening to a podcast where they 

2906
02:02:17,331 --> 02:02:18,164
were talking.
This guy was talking about how usually 

2907
02:02:19,911 --> 02:02:20,744
sleeps like a baby,
but he went up to Alaska and because 

2908
02:02:22,941 --> 02:02:23,774
it's it's only dark for two hours a 
night in the summer where they were at 

2909
02:02:26,961 --> 02:02:27,794
and I think they were in the brooks 
range and he was saying that like after 

2910
02:02:30,651 --> 02:02:34,030
like six or seven days started getting 
delusional and just delirious.

2911
02:02:34,050 --> 02:02:35,240
You know what's going on?

2912
02:02:35,690 --> 02:02:38,850
That circadian rhythm,
is that just the Light?

2913
02:02:38,851 --> 02:02:39,684
Because say the light affects the optic 
nerves where you're supposed to produce 

2914
02:02:42,931 --> 02:02:43,630
melatonin.

2915
02:02:43,630 --> 02:02:44,463
Yeah.
Yeah,

2916
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:46,820
and this guy was saying that the way to 
mitigate that,

2917
02:02:46,821 --> 02:02:47,654
that he didn't know at the time,
but he was told by someone is to wear a 

2918
02:02:50,271 --> 02:02:53,210
mask that those,
those sleeping mask you see in movies,

2919
02:02:53,670 --> 02:02:57,500
you always look so silly and movies,
but those things are actually effective.

2920
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:58,650
Yeah,
I,

2921
02:02:58,950 --> 02:03:02,150
I been sloppy about it,
but a fucking Alaska though.

2922
02:03:02,151 --> 02:03:04,190
You need it.
I've been in the summer.

2923
02:03:04,310 --> 02:03:04,760
El.
Yeah,

2924
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:05,540
it's awesome.
Right?

2925
02:03:05,540 --> 02:03:07,160
Many tImes.
Weird though.

2926
02:03:07,390 --> 02:03:08,223
We would have,
we would bear hunt until I used to go 

2927
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:14,060
with roy almost every year.
We'd bear hunt until.

2928
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:17,230
Oh god,
I want to thank one in the morning.

2929
02:03:18,220 --> 02:03:19,690
It would go.
We'd go back,

2930
02:03:19,780 --> 02:03:22,840
eat,
and then go Fishing at like three in the

2931
02:03:22,841 --> 02:03:24,820
morning.
It was like dark for an hour.

2932
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:27,850
Then we'd go fishing,
then we'd start baiting again.

2933
02:03:27,851 --> 02:03:30,160
Then we'd hung out that night.
Then we'd do the same thing.

2934
02:03:30,250 --> 02:03:33,850
No sleep.
Which part of Alaska we were.

2935
02:03:34,350 --> 02:03:35,183
It's like the who sit in a river,
so it's just north or south central 

2936
02:03:37,961 --> 02:03:38,794
basically.
Okay.

2937
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,540
It's just.
I've been up there a few times,

2938
02:03:40,541 --> 02:03:45,541
but until they see seward and then up 
north where they do like salmon fishing,

2939
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:50,710
it's whether the commercial guys will 
come in and they'll,

2940
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:53,020
they'll.
It's like the net them.

2941
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:54,940
Yeah.
But they'll be.

2942
02:03:54,950 --> 02:03:56,760
The tides gets so loW stuff.
They'll,

2943
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:57,753
they'll do like,
they'll drive on the beach of these 

2944
02:03:58,690 --> 02:04:00,480
amphibious uh,
uh,

2945
02:04:00,490 --> 02:04:01,450
boats.
Yeah.

2946
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:03,310
It's crazy and I'm like laid the net and
stuff.

2947
02:04:03,490 --> 02:04:06,360
It really is the last frontier up there 
really is.

2948
02:04:06,361 --> 02:04:07,650
It's amazing.
Yeah.

2949
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:09,520
Too cold though,
too cold.

2950
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:11,170
Dare you.
How dare you?

2951
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:12,033
San diego.
I'm a total pussY when it comes to 

2952
02:04:15,371 --> 02:04:18,040
whether you lived in Hawaii and now you 
live in san diego.

2953
02:04:18,041 --> 02:04:18,880
It's like,
come on,

2954
02:04:18,881 --> 02:04:20,970
man,
you're in paradise both times.

2955
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:24,290
You didn't get anywhere now.
Right?

2956
02:04:24,330 --> 02:04:25,163
It'S just one of those places where 
people In san diego don't want you 

2957
02:04:27,131 --> 02:04:28,810
telling people how good san diego is.
Like.

2958
02:04:30,430 --> 02:04:31,263
They're mad at me every.
There's a thousand thousand people 

2959
02:04:32,441 --> 02:04:35,800
screaming right now going to fuck up.
The traffic's already sucks.

2960
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,890
Yeah.
It's way worse now than it used to be in

2961
02:04:37,891 --> 02:04:40,350
san diego.
Used to be way easier to get around.

2962
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:42,220
True,
it's good skydiving of use.

2963
02:04:42,590 --> 02:04:43,423
I have,
I have had dropped down the border like 

2964
02:04:46,170 --> 02:04:48,900
alcohol and area.
Where was I?

2965
02:04:48,950 --> 02:04:49,783
There was some lake.
There's the olympic training center out 

2966
02:04:52,051 --> 02:04:52,590
there.

2967
02:04:52,590 --> 02:04:53,880
Do you know where that is?
No,

2968
02:04:54,010 --> 02:04:57,060
I can't remember what the lake was,
but people don't realize about cindy.

2969
02:04:57,070 --> 02:04:59,340
Two is like,
it's a lot of ranch land.

2970
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:00,653
You know what I mean?
It is obviously the coastal areas is a 

2971
02:05:03,001 --> 02:05:05,460
little sliver.
And then uh,

2972
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:06,653
you go east and you're right in rancho 
santa fe in five minutes and it's just 

2973
02:05:09,330 --> 02:05:11,460
beautiful.
Orange goes old California,

2974
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:12,750
you know,
uh,

2975
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:15,440
you know,
tons of ranch land people riding horses.

2976
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:18,150
Goldberg's got a ranch out there.
Goldberg the wrestler.

2977
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:21,120
Oh yeah.
He's got some bad ass place out there.

2978
02:05:21,121 --> 02:05:23,430
It keeps his muscle cars.
I thought mike goldberg.

2979
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:24,241
No,
michael,

2980
02:05:24,241 --> 02:05:25,074
he lives in boys.
When we were watching ufc the other 

2981
02:05:26,821 --> 02:05:27,690
night,
they were like,

2982
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:29,040
bring goldberg back.

2983
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:31,841
There was a,
uh,

2984
02:05:31,841 --> 02:05:35,000
there's a survey someone did online was 
like,

2985
02:05:35,110 --> 02:05:39,210
keep jon anik,
me and dominick cruz was a.

2986
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:43,200
And then goldberg was b and it was like 
90 percent be.

2987
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:44,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

2988
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:45,353
I sent it to the ufc.
Did you know what do you look at this 

2989
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:50,560
when you think of that?
You know,

2990
02:05:51,390 --> 02:05:53,490
I get it.
People want change,

2991
02:05:53,550 --> 02:05:55,080
especially if they own it,
you know,

2992
02:05:55,860 --> 02:05:58,410
4 billion bucks for something.
But your signature on something,

2993
02:05:58,411 --> 02:06:00,120
I guess you want to change the color of 
the car.

2994
02:06:00,121 --> 02:06:01,890
I bought a new car,
cost me $4,000,000,000.

2995
02:06:01,891 --> 02:06:03,450
I'm going to make it red.
I always wanted it red.

2996
02:06:03,580 --> 02:06:06,410
Or are you going to uh,
uh,

2997
02:06:07,190 --> 02:06:10,020
efficient ip and married them?
He going to commentate the.

2998
02:06:10,021 --> 02:06:12,030
A tough fight if you,
if,

2999
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:12,873
if I mean,
will you be the front runner to be one 

3000
02:06:14,701 --> 02:06:18,690
of the commentators that they do the 
mcgregor mayweather fight?

3001
02:06:19,470 --> 02:06:21,920
Most likely no,
because it's a boxing match.

3002
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:23,220
Most likely.
I'll just,

3003
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:27,840
I'll be here watching it on the screen 
for it though,

3004
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:29,640
if it happens.
I mean,

3005
02:06:30,270 --> 02:06:32,520
I just don't think so.
I think it's that it's a.

3006
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:35,190
I'm not a boxing commentator.
I know a lot about boxing,

3007
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:36,553
followed boxing since I was a kid and 
I've commentated on kickboxing baths 

3008
02:06:40,261 --> 02:06:41,094
before,
but I've never commented on a boxing 

3009
02:06:42,361 --> 02:06:43,830
fight before.
It would be kind of cool though.

3010
02:06:43,831 --> 02:06:44,664
They had a couple of two guys in boxing 
world in you because maybe you were 

3011
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,270
there to collect.
They always have jim lampley.

3012
02:06:51,380 --> 02:06:52,110
Yeah,
right.

3013
02:06:52,110 --> 02:06:55,580
Is that who they always have in max 
kellerman who I really love max.

3014
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:56,930
I love that guy.
Yeah,

3015
02:06:56,931 --> 02:06:59,880
I would.
I would be happy To do a paper view with

3016
02:06:59,881 --> 02:07:01,530
max kellerman.
I think it'd be fun.

3017
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:02,963
Yeah,
a big dude and a different perspective 

3018
02:07:05,131 --> 02:07:08,220
just because with mcgregor coming out of
the ufc,

3019
02:07:08,660 --> 02:07:10,250
paulie malignaggi,
he's another one.

3020
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:11,093
I really respect that guy a lot.
He's a great commentator and world 

3021
02:07:14,131 --> 02:07:17,910
champion boxer that be maybe most likely
know.

3022
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,890
Most likely.
I just do.

3023
02:07:19,891 --> 02:07:23,320
I'm doing less and less of those.
I just a.

3024
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:26,240
I do 10 a year now.
I would use the most I've ever done.

3025
02:07:26,260 --> 02:07:28,860
I think it was up to like 24 a year.
It was just too much,

3026
02:07:28,861 --> 02:07:31,150
man.
You don't.

3027
02:07:31,470 --> 02:07:32,303
You're not doing them all now.
You're no international paper view 

3028
02:07:33,871 --> 02:07:36,250
anymore.
You just said I'm own domestic.

3029
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:39,910
No fox ones anymore.
Like all those big fox shows,

3030
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:42,920
the cut all those out.
Oh,

3031
02:07:42,921 --> 02:07:45,430
I do now as domestic paper view.
That's it.

3032
02:07:45,610 --> 02:07:46,930
Gotcha.
So it's about 10,

3033
02:07:47,050 --> 02:07:48,220
10 a year.
Yeah,

3034
02:07:48,221 --> 02:07:50,620
the international magnetic.
That's just fuck.

3035
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:55,480
We had fun.
We went to rio and watch the funnel.

3036
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:56,493
Yeah.
Camp came with me down when she fought 

3037
02:07:57,401 --> 02:08:00,520
betco hey,
a starch during the first round.

3038
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:01,720
Thirty four.
Second time.

3039
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:02,583
It was fun,
but you remember how sketchy it was and 

3040
02:08:04,421 --> 02:08:05,950
we were.
We driving around a bulletproof car.

3041
02:08:05,951 --> 02:08:07,630
We got an armed guard with us 
everywhere.

3042
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,560
It's fucking.

3043
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:11,680
I didn't,
I didn't have any of that.

3044
02:08:11,770 --> 02:08:14,280
They must,
you must be a pretty big down there.

3045
02:08:14,290 --> 02:08:15,080
Very important.

3046
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:20,040
Yeah.
I thought it was for me because it could

3047
02:08:20,050 --> 02:08:21,250
have been.
They know a big.

3048
02:08:21,890 --> 02:08:22,723
Yeah.
Yeah.

3049
02:08:22,770 --> 02:08:24,050
And they know that you don't pack a 
piece,

3050
02:08:24,051 --> 02:08:24,740
so they're like,
okay,

3051
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:25,573
cool.

3052
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:27,530
Yeah,
we was down there with gel and she was,

3053
02:08:27,830 --> 02:08:29,930
she was taking helicopters around.
Oh yeah.

3054
02:08:29,931 --> 02:08:31,280
To get around.
That was a,

3055
02:08:31,310 --> 02:08:32,220
that's the way to do it.
Yeah.

3056
02:08:32,221 --> 02:08:36,230
That was the way we were in sao paulo 
actually avoid being carjacked.

3057
02:08:36,260 --> 02:08:37,510
Is that why she took it?
Well,

3058
02:08:37,610 --> 02:08:38,600
I think it was just.
I mean,

3059
02:08:38,601 --> 02:08:40,760
I imagine there's some,
maybe I have no idea,

3060
02:08:40,761 --> 02:08:42,500
but I think we just avoid traffic.

3061
02:08:42,530 --> 02:08:45,450
Yeah,
there's a lot of terrible.

3062
02:08:45,510 --> 02:08:46,281
I mean,
I don't know where we.

3063
02:08:46,281 --> 02:08:47,360
Where the traffic was.
Terrible.

3064
02:08:47,361 --> 02:08:49,140
There was one road.
Well that's real.

3065
02:08:49,150 --> 02:08:50,150
Yeah,
we're by the beach.

3066
02:08:50,151 --> 02:08:51,830
That was probably when we got to the 
fight.

3067
02:08:51,831 --> 02:08:55,750
It took forever to get to the fight.
Like you have to leave three hours early

3068
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:56,633
were like,
what?

3069
02:08:57,110 --> 02:08:58,150
Then you get in the car.
He like,

3070
02:08:58,151 --> 02:08:58,970
oh,
I get it.

3071
02:08:58,970 --> 02:08:59,803
That was wild was going out as well.
We're talking to dana lash on the phone 

3072
02:09:02,630 --> 02:09:04,890
because it was right when cecil the bear
was happening.

3073
02:09:04,891 --> 02:09:05,950
That the line.
So the.

3074
02:09:06,050 --> 02:09:06,883
Oh,
excuse me.

3075
02:09:07,460 --> 02:09:12,460
I was reading about it on a tv show.
Cecil the kangaroo.

3076
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:17,510
That thing was going down,
man.

3077
02:09:17,570 --> 02:09:20,000
Yeah,
I remember that as it goes at the time,

3078
02:09:20,001 --> 02:09:22,130
but yeah,
that was the last time I went to Brazil.

3079
02:09:22,131 --> 02:09:24,260
I was like,
I think I've been to Brazil five times.

3080
02:09:24,450 --> 02:09:26,210
I love it.
I love the brazilians.

3081
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:28,520
I love the food down there.
It's fun.

3082
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:29,720
It's great.
And everything like that.

3083
02:09:29,780 --> 02:09:33,320
We're going to go see chrYsler redeemer 
that that was our goal to go do that.

3084
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:35,510
Do You know what a process that is to go
see that thing?

3085
02:09:35,570 --> 02:09:36,403
No.
Really?

3086
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:38,150
Oh My god.
it takes forever.

3087
02:09:38,151 --> 02:09:38,984
It was like a whole day.
You to take buses halfway than other 

3088
02:09:41,811 --> 02:09:42,644
buses.
It's just like you cannot just go up 

3089
02:09:44,721 --> 02:09:45,554
there.
Can't be just better to get in a 

3090
02:09:46,011 --> 02:09:47,810
helicopter.
Pretty dope statue though.

3091
02:09:48,430 --> 02:09:49,910
Some may.
I want her to Be there.

3092
02:09:50,030 --> 02:09:50,863
So we got one from afar.
We add it in the background and we were 

3093
02:09:53,991 --> 02:09:55,400
like,
it's pretty cool though.

3094
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:56,450
it's pretty.

3095
02:09:56,450 --> 02:09:57,610
I'd like to fly it.
I'm,

3096
02:09:57,700 --> 02:09:58,430
I,
uh,

3097
02:09:58,430 --> 02:09:59,570
I'm a,
I'm a pilot.

3098
02:09:59,571 --> 02:10:00,880
I'm a real.
Yeah,

3099
02:10:01,070 --> 02:10:02,100
no kidding.
Yeah.

3100
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:03,410
Yeah.
And so I'd like to,

3101
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:04,760
I'd like to fly that.
That's kind of,

3102
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,170
you know,
for pilots it's kind of like,

3103
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:07,620
oh,
that's a bucket list place at.

3104
02:10:09,450 --> 02:10:10,790
Yeah.
Other places.

3105
02:10:10,990 --> 02:10:14,240
How does that work?
If you have a license in America and you

3106
02:10:14,241 --> 02:10:17,210
want to fly in Brazil,
obviously you can't fly a helicopter all

3107
02:10:17,211 --> 02:10:20,330
the way to Brazil.
No flY.

3108
02:10:20,331 --> 02:10:22,230
Like what's the longest distance?
Well,

3109
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:22,610
it,
it,

3110
02:10:22,610 --> 02:10:23,443
it really,
it really just depends on what 

3111
02:10:24,261 --> 02:10:26,840
helicopter you're talking about and how 
many people you're,

3112
02:10:26,990 --> 02:10:28,880
you're west.
So a lot of people's,

3113
02:10:29,150 --> 02:10:31,580
the furthest travel,
the helicopters ever gone.

3114
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:35,060
Well that's a,
a black hawk I would imagine.

3115
02:10:35,330 --> 02:10:38,330
TheY have a dual engines and they have 
their,

3116
02:10:38,970 --> 02:10:41,780
you know,
$11,000,000 or $20,000,000 helicopter,

3117
02:10:41,781 --> 02:10:43,310
whatever it is.
It's got,

3118
02:10:43,370 --> 02:10:45,860
you kNow,
a massive fuel tanks that,

3119
02:10:46,160 --> 02:10:48,920
you know,
a civilian helicopter can't go.

3120
02:10:48,930 --> 02:10:50,120
I,
so I wouldn't know the answer,

3121
02:10:50,540 --> 02:10:54,070
but I know jamie like a black blackout.
I'm going to guess.

3122
02:10:54,090 --> 02:10:55,930
Let's guess,
how far do you think?

3123
02:10:56,090 --> 02:11:00,510
I bet they can fly for 12 hours.
No way.

3124
02:11:00,980 --> 02:11:02,460
That's a long time.
I don't think so.

3125
02:11:02,690 --> 02:11:07,690
I think I'm hearing you say I'm going to
say 300 miles.

3126
02:11:08,150 --> 02:11:09,140
Yeah,
that's it.

3127
02:11:09,230 --> 02:11:12,620
I'm going to say that if someone's 
chasing complete guests,

3128
02:11:12,621 --> 02:11:13,790
I have no idea.
I would,

3129
02:11:13,850 --> 02:11:16,550
I would,
I would kind of go on cameron syme.

3130
02:11:16,551 --> 02:11:20,670
I'm saying across the ocean three times,
so not even close.

3131
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:23,420
If you're thinking 12 hours,
how fast do they go?

3132
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:24,890
Well,
it depends.

3133
02:11:24,891 --> 02:11:26,810
If you're on a,
if you're in a piston helicopter,

3134
02:11:27,060 --> 02:11:28,750
you know,
or if you're in a turban helicopter,

3135
02:11:28,790 --> 02:11:29,700
like a black hawk.
Oh,

3136
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:31,060
what's the difference?
Well,

3137
02:11:31,070 --> 02:11:34,370
piston helicopter is,
is like a piston engine,

3138
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:36,500
you know,
like a car engine.

3139
02:11:36,530 --> 02:11:37,670
Yeah.
But it uses,

3140
02:11:37,710 --> 02:11:38,660
uses,
you know,

3141
02:11:38,661 --> 02:11:39,494
your,
uh,

3142
02:11:39,530 --> 02:11:41,900
your blades this in the same sort of 
fashion,

3143
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:47,320
but a fast speed on a,
on like a 44,

3144
02:11:48,770 --> 02:11:49,603
you know,
you like 130 knots I think as your v 

3145
02:11:52,101 --> 02:11:57,101
one,
which is your miles without landing.

3146
02:11:57,380 --> 02:11:58,213
Two thousand 200.
And this is where we get your 

3147
02:12:03,621 --> 02:12:06,380
information from a small helicopter.
that's an md.

3148
02:12:06,381 --> 02:12:07,410
500.
that's not it.

3149
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:09,190
That's the black hawk.
That's not a,

3150
02:12:09,350 --> 02:12:13,630
that's not black rock concert right 
there.

3151
02:12:13,650 --> 02:12:15,000
What do You mean it's not right?
It's on the wiki.

3152
02:12:15,470 --> 02:12:17,900
We already diScussed this.
Anyone can edit this.

3153
02:12:17,901 --> 02:12:20,310
Of course it's,
was wrongly was correct.

3154
02:12:20,311 --> 02:12:23,050
So,
so 400 miles on it or no?

3155
02:12:23,420 --> 02:12:26,150
Two hundred 50 miles per hour.
That lender goes,

3156
02:12:26,151 --> 02:12:27,440
that's pretty amazing.
And that's a,

3157
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:32,740
that's a record that's find out what?
See if you can google a blackhawk google

3158
02:12:35,331 --> 02:12:38,300
black hawk helicopter.
What would you google?

3159
02:12:38,830 --> 02:12:39,760
Long,
long distance.

3160
02:12:39,870 --> 02:12:42,650
Long distance distance capability 
capability or something?

3161
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:45,650
Distance.
Let's see.

3162
02:12:46,820 --> 02:12:48,080
Two hundred 76 miles.
Wow.

3163
02:12:48,081 --> 02:12:49,370
That's a lot different.
Hey,

3164
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:51,050
nautical miles,
300.

3165
02:12:51,370 --> 02:12:52,203
Three hundred nautical mile.
One hundred and 51 miles shorter than 

3166
02:12:54,561 --> 02:12:56,630
other.
Similar rotated aircrafts.

3167
02:12:56,631 --> 02:13:00,530
Maximum altitude is 6,000 feet.
Tufts v 1:50.

3168
02:13:00,531 --> 02:13:03,350
Once they see they're pretty fast 
because you know a turban.

3169
02:13:03,351 --> 02:13:06,170
Helicopter.
What you can get some civilian ones.

3170
02:13:06,171 --> 02:13:07,660
The md 500.
What does that entail?

3171
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:09,310
When you say knots,
what does that mean?

3172
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:11,480
Like mile per hour?
Wind.

3173
02:13:11,481 --> 02:13:16,481
Fifty one miles per hour.
I would have to check.

3174
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:20,690
Why do they say nautical miles?
Two miles or longer than than.

3175
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:21,583
I'm pretty close.
One point one we'll put one foot or one 

3176
02:13:25,050 --> 02:13:25,970
five.
Okay.

3177
02:13:25,971 --> 02:13:26,804
So it's one point.
One mile per hour for every one mile an 

3178
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:30,380
hour.
Not to a mile.

3179
02:13:30,440 --> 02:13:31,980
So it's almost,
it's more than 100.

3180
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:33,900
Fifty miles an hour.
300 or.

3181
02:13:33,901 --> 02:13:34,980
Wait?
Yeah,

3182
02:13:34,981 --> 02:13:37,950
I thought it was 207 instead of 150 
knots,

3183
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:39,400
didn't it?
A hundred 50 knots.

3184
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:41,970
Yeah.
So it's one point.

3185
02:13:41,971 --> 02:13:42,870
One,
two each.

3186
02:13:42,871 --> 02:13:45,690
So 176.
What's that one?

3187
02:13:45,691 --> 02:13:48,020
51 nuts.
Top speed comes at 1:50.

3188
02:13:48,030 --> 02:13:51,630
One knots at 60.
One nautical mile distance.

3189
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:54,060
Yeah.
I typed in distance and that's the so it

3190
02:13:54,061 --> 02:13:55,170
can fly.
Oh,

3191
02:13:55,171 --> 02:13:56,790
I see.
So would you.

3192
02:13:56,950 --> 02:13:59,600
Was this last one?
Knots or miles you just googled.

3193
02:13:59,610 --> 02:14:04,610
The second thing is just how would not 
miles but not nautical miles per hour.

3194
02:14:08,730 --> 02:14:10,830
that's whether or not his medical mile 
per hour.

3195
02:14:11,190 --> 02:14:12,330
Oh,
okay.

3196
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:17,480
So the speed of knots is the same as 
nautical miles.

3197
02:14:18,270 --> 02:14:19,570
Oh,
okay.

3198
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:20,640
Oh,
how interesting.

3199
02:14:20,770 --> 02:14:22,380
So I wonder why that was just.
She was miles.

3200
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:24,540
Why fucking confused the shit out of 
everybody?

3201
02:14:25,350 --> 02:14:26,183
That's a,
it's the same thing with the standard 

3202
02:14:27,571 --> 02:14:28,590
metrics.
Did you know that?

3203
02:14:28,591 --> 02:14:29,424
Uh,
not in the nautical mile with the same 

3204
02:14:30,211 --> 02:14:32,420
thing.
I just learned that I didn't know,

3205
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:33,593
but it's just like adam putting up 
celsius for temperature that the green 

3206
02:14:37,090 --> 02:14:38,700
tree Australia.
I know,

3207
02:14:38,701 --> 02:14:41,270
I just say nobody knows what celsius is.
What we should.

3208
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:43,290
He put up american dollars to just for 
instagram.

3209
02:14:44,910 --> 02:14:46,500
What do you do with that stupid green 
money?

3210
02:14:47,050 --> 02:14:49,290
Your money's the wrong color.
Sorry mate.

3211
02:14:52,270 --> 02:14:53,910
Yeah.
It's weird when you go down there too,

3212
02:14:53,940 --> 02:14:54,773
because everybody looks normal.
Then they start driving on the lefthand 

3213
02:14:57,210 --> 02:14:58,043
side of the road and they talk weird 
that the steering wheels on the wrong 

3214
02:15:00,781 --> 02:15:02,670
side all fucked up.
They don't know what the deal.

3215
02:15:02,680 --> 02:15:04,140
They're not normal.
They are great people.

3216
02:15:04,141 --> 02:15:06,990
I was just down there for six months and
I really do like the australian people.

3217
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:08,970
That's the second place I live other 
than America.

3218
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:10,890
One hundred percent.
Number one is Canada.

3219
02:15:11,070 --> 02:15:12,690
I moved to Canada first.
You would?

3220
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:13,593
Yeah.
If shit went down to kill everything up 

3221
02:15:16,741 --> 02:15:17,574
there.
Moose.

3222
02:15:17,940 --> 02:15:20,160
Look,
I think if it's the nicest people in the

3223
02:15:20,161 --> 02:15:20,994
world,
I think canadians are the nicest soccer 

3224
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,100
on earth.
They're always.

3225
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:23,960
Sorry,
sorry.

3226
02:15:24,030 --> 02:15:25,170
Sorry.
Sorry.

3227
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:26,663
What's it all about?
But so that's like the place I'd live 

3228
02:15:29,881 --> 02:15:32,040
first other than America.
Number two is Australia.

3229
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:34,380
It's a close second to especially 
melbourne.

3230
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:36,210
I fucking love melbourne.
Yeah.

3231
02:15:36,330 --> 02:15:38,460
such a great.
Like melbourne city.

3232
02:15:38,670 --> 02:15:40,530
I love both of them.
They're both awesome,

3233
02:15:40,531 --> 02:15:42,990
but melbourne and good.
I just had a great time in melbourne.

3234
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:45,930
The amazing food this shows we did were 
amazing.

3235
02:15:45,931 --> 02:15:47,730
It's just such a great time.
Yeah,

3236
02:15:47,820 --> 02:15:49,050
I really like sydney.
The,

3237
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:50,880
the whole,
the whole country man.

3238
02:15:50,930 --> 02:15:55,860
It's just great and it's got so much 
more open space and it's just huge.

3239
02:15:56,390 --> 02:15:57,223
It's huge for the amount of people that 
have their less people than in the 

3240
02:15:59,581 --> 02:16:00,414
greater los angeles area and the entire 
country is the size of the United 

3241
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:04,981
States.
Yeah,

3242
02:16:04,981 --> 02:16:06,900
that's crazy.
That's awesome.

3243
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:08,760
That's crazy.
It's a lot of country.

3244
02:16:08,761 --> 02:16:12,010
That was one of the reasons why the so 
nice and I do hear though that there,

3245
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:12,893
there's a lot of interesting stuff 
happening in the desert out there with 

3246
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:19,320
nuclear waste that they're allowing them
to dump out there.

3247
02:16:19,740 --> 02:16:20,573
Oh,
they're trying to make some godzilla 

3248
02:16:21,061 --> 02:16:24,860
type shit.
That's what I would do it.

3249
02:16:24,890 --> 02:16:25,723
See what happens is some spots out there
with nothing but spiders and crocodiles 

3250
02:16:28,111 --> 02:16:31,360
throws me uranium out there.
There's some,

3251
02:16:31,390 --> 02:16:32,223
there's some stuff out there that can 
kill you for sure that everything is 

3252
02:16:35,830 --> 02:16:38,200
going.
He's had down there soon.

3253
02:16:38,201 --> 02:16:39,034
I'm super jealous.
He's going to do 18 days hunting water 

3254
02:16:41,321 --> 02:16:44,830
buffaloes and kangaroos and shit.
You're going to shoot a kangaroo?

3255
02:16:44,890 --> 02:16:45,940
No,
it allowed to.

3256
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,880
Are you allowed to hunt kangaroos?
Yeah.

3257
02:16:49,710 --> 02:16:50,660
Kangaroos.
Turkey.

3258
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:53,590
Supposed to taste good.
It's supposed to taste like venison.

3259
02:16:54,010 --> 02:16:54,843
What?
Uh,

3260
02:16:54,850 --> 02:16:56,630
what movie were you doing there?
Uh,

3261
02:16:56,631 --> 02:16:59,160
I was shooting a pacific rim.
Oh,

3262
02:16:59,170 --> 02:17:00,790
you did that.
How was that?

3263
02:17:01,090 --> 02:17:03,320
It was cool.
It was like the,

3264
02:17:03,560 --> 02:17:04,393
you know,
you're creating a godzilla monster type 

3265
02:17:06,131 --> 02:17:06,964
things.
Right?

3266
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:10,360
Right.
Like how do you act when it's like cgi?

3267
02:17:10,570 --> 02:17:12,570
What does that like?
I don't know.

3268
02:17:12,730 --> 02:17:14,110
I guess I don't know what it is.
What is it?

3269
02:17:14,290 --> 02:17:15,700
Pacific rims,
a monster movie.

3270
02:17:16,580 --> 02:17:18,910
Shit grows in the mountain.
The ground comes out.

3271
02:17:19,060 --> 02:17:20,890
Fucks everybody up.
It's like the dinosaurs.

3272
02:17:20,891 --> 02:17:23,080
But in the future of the dinosaurs came 
back.

3273
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:24,550
Wow.
Yeah.

3274
02:17:24,990 --> 02:17:26,410
Cool.
It's very cool concept.

3275
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:30,900
Since guy you throw godzilla,
passive eyes rolled back and said,

3276
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:32,040
it's like pitch.
I ran 200,

3277
02:17:32,050 --> 02:17:34,560
five miles.
I got no time for fucking monsters.

3278
02:17:36,510 --> 02:17:39,210
I'm a bow hunter.
I got no time for fake monster.

3279
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:40,073
That bears.
That's what I told scott yesterday is 

3280
02:17:41,650 --> 02:17:44,050
like,
you know a lot about a lot.

3281
02:17:44,170 --> 02:17:49,150
I said I know a sort of a lot about two 
things running,

3282
02:17:49,360 --> 02:17:50,800
running in,
bowhunter it.

3283
02:17:51,080 --> 02:17:53,750
Anything else?
I don't know.

3284
02:17:53,770 --> 02:17:54,603
A lot and I know a lot about two things.
I know enough to pretend I know a lot 

3285
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:04,500
about everything else you asked you 
about martial arts or comedy.

3286
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:08,620
I can give you some long ass answer.
I know what the fuck I'm talking about.

3287
02:18:08,650 --> 02:18:10,760
Yeah,
but you get into other area.

3288
02:18:10,761 --> 02:18:11,481
I'm like,
hmm,

3289
02:18:11,481 --> 02:18:15,880
I better google jamie,
jamie to follow me around.

3290
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:16,733
Zach,
do dobyns better jamie and pulling shit 

3291
02:18:18,581 --> 02:18:19,900
up,
but you're in the middle of going,

3292
02:18:19,930 --> 02:18:20,990
wait a minute.
Is that right?

3293
02:18:20,991 --> 02:18:23,420
And then all sudden pops up.
Yeah.

3294
02:18:23,890 --> 02:18:24,723
That's invaluable resource.
That makes me look so much smarter than 

3295
02:18:26,831 --> 02:18:27,664
I really am.
There's no way you can know everything 

3296
02:18:30,161 --> 02:18:32,320
about everything and anybody who claims 
to is an asshole.

3297
02:18:32,380 --> 02:18:34,390
This is just not possible.
Well,

3298
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:36,130
how much information can you burn even 
take,

3299
02:18:36,131 --> 02:18:36,740
right?
I mean,

3300
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:38,380
good question.
You know they say some of them.

3301
02:18:38,470 --> 02:18:40,590
I've heard several times now that you're
only supposed,

3302
02:18:40,630 --> 02:18:41,463
you only supposed to be able to really 
recognize 150 people or something like 

3303
02:18:46,691 --> 02:18:49,600
that where you can have relationships.
One hundred 50 people.

3304
02:18:49,660 --> 02:18:52,180
Right?
Which is a lot of guys are super psyched

3305
02:18:52,181 --> 02:18:52,901
about that.
They're like,

3306
02:18:52,901 --> 02:18:54,730
yes,
this one thing,

3307
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:59,380
1:50,
this is great.

3308
02:18:59,570 --> 02:19:00,100
Uh,
yeah.

3309
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:02,650
It's called dunbar's number,
dunbar's number.

3310
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:07,090
You keep 150 people in your head that we
have friendships with.

3311
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:08,013
It's very strange.
Like the idea is that our brain was 

3312
02:19:10,361 --> 02:19:14,890
designed to absorb the names and faces 
of people that are in our tribe and then

3313
02:19:14,891 --> 02:19:17,590
when tribes get over 150 people there 
essentially unmanageable.

3314
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:19,720
Yeah,
I believe it.

3315
02:19:19,990 --> 02:19:20,823
I believe it too.
I think it goes back to what we're 

3316
02:19:21,461 --> 02:19:24,130
talking about when we're saying that 
people aren't designed for cities,

3317
02:19:24,131 --> 02:19:28,310
they're not designed for this life and 
for televisions and lights that you just

3318
02:19:28,311 --> 02:19:29,144
switch on and off that were really 
designed to say the reason why you feel 

3319
02:19:31,581 --> 02:19:32,414
so content when you're in the mountains 
and set your body's designed for that 

3320
02:19:34,980 --> 02:19:36,060
literally.
Yeah.

3321
02:19:36,340 --> 02:19:38,000
Yeah.
And for hunting.

3322
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:39,500
So yeah.
Sorry.

3323
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:42,410
Anti hadn't psychos,
poor people.

3324
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:45,620
I feel I hate the city.
Did you know the anti hunting people?

3325
02:19:45,621 --> 02:19:46,454
You know,
they just,

3326
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:49,820
they get food easy.
It's easy to get food.

3327
02:19:49,850 --> 02:19:52,350
You should wasn't.
They would turn the brand.

3328
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:55,430
They would fucking all listened to me.
You've all of you.

3329
02:19:55,431 --> 02:19:57,770
You would shoot a rabbit right in the 
face if you were starving,

3330
02:19:57,771 --> 02:19:59,540
your kids were crying,
guaranteed.

3331
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:01,670
If it gets ugly,
if it all gets ugly,

3332
02:20:01,671 --> 02:20:03,980
you become a predator.
Guaranteed.

3333
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:06,950
Guaranteed because animals are going to 
hunt you to fuck face.

3334
02:20:06,951 --> 02:20:07,784
Guess what?
You're out there in the woods by 

3335
02:20:08,961 --> 02:20:09,794
yourself and you're making a lean to and
you have to fight the coyote that's 

3336
02:20:12,290 --> 02:20:14,090
trying to drag your kid off in the 
middle of the night.

3337
02:20:14,250 --> 02:20:15,083
Yeah.
That coyote gets roasted over an open 

3338
02:20:16,251 --> 02:20:18,560
fire with a big smile on your face.

3339
02:20:18,580 --> 02:20:21,050
It happens.
Brendan put up a picture of the grizzly.

3340
02:20:21,051 --> 02:20:24,040
I killed up on his page yesterday.
Tom.

3341
02:20:24,050 --> 02:20:29,000
I've got a tsunami but her.
He had to take imaginable to text me and

3342
02:20:29,001 --> 02:20:32,180
telling me,
sorry about all the hate and I'm like.

3343
02:20:32,650 --> 02:20:33,483
I said,
dude,

3344
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:35,030
I just told him,
hey,

3345
02:20:35,031 --> 02:20:36,290
you gotta take the good with the bad.
I said,

3346
02:20:36,291 --> 02:20:38,660
this is all part of the deal.
It's interesting to people,

3347
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:39,553
you know,
they don't understand like here's my 

3348
02:20:41,211 --> 02:20:42,044
favorite one ever when you were talking 
about bear hunting and like you were 

3349
02:20:45,201 --> 02:20:46,034
saying,
you know that the bear populations have 

3350
02:20:47,451 --> 02:20:48,284
to be controlled and the woman on the 
show was because you've killed off all 

3351
02:20:50,511 --> 02:20:52,760
their predators.
Like What are you talking about?

3352
02:20:52,761 --> 02:20:53,600
Dinosaurs,
bitch,

3353
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:56,930
what the hell is killing grizzly bear?
Are you crazy?

3354
02:20:57,410 --> 02:21:00,550
The only thing that kills grizzly bears 
his other grizzly bears,

3355
02:21:00,890 --> 02:21:04,640
unless you want to have a grizzly bear,
cannibal apocalypse going on up there,

3356
02:21:04,970 --> 02:21:06,080
you've got to control their numbers.

3357
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:07,310
Yeah,
I know,

3358
02:21:07,370 --> 02:21:09,110
and that's.
I told brendan that too.

3359
02:21:09,111 --> 02:21:09,681
I said,
listen,

3360
02:21:09,681 --> 02:21:11,960
these people just don't realize that if 
the grizzlies,

3361
02:21:12,170 --> 02:21:13,003
the brown bears up there where you can 
kill two a year because there's so many 

3362
02:21:15,561 --> 02:21:19,850
of them that if we didn't control and 
there'd be no moose deer,

3363
02:21:19,851 --> 02:21:20,760
there'd be no.
A lot of,

3364
02:21:21,020 --> 02:21:21,853
especially the moose,
they just focus on those moose when the 

3365
02:21:24,081 --> 02:21:28,220
calves are dropping and so there was 
follow up the pregnant female around and

3366
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:32,510
eat the calf when it drops and with,
without us controlling them,

3367
02:21:32,511 --> 02:21:35,610
those it'd be gone 100 percent sort of 
similar,

3368
02:21:35,950 --> 02:21:36,783
you know,
I don't know exactly the numbers or 

3369
02:21:37,941 --> 02:21:39,680
anything aBout a great white sharks,
right?

3370
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:43,690
Like everyone's protected those for so 
long that then like that's,

3371
02:21:43,770 --> 02:21:48,770
that will start screwing up the cycle 
because then you're the tuna.

3372
02:21:50,300 --> 02:21:52,010
So let me,
I'm gonna get this wrong,

3373
02:21:52,011 --> 02:21:52,844
but the tuna population,
because we're taking all the tuna 

3374
02:21:55,240 --> 02:21:56,073
population,
everyone's so psycho over tuna and raw 

3375
02:21:57,681 --> 02:21:58,360
fish,
right?

3376
02:21:58,360 --> 02:21:59,660
Yeah.
So then,

3377
02:21:59,740 --> 02:22:04,070
and we're protecting all the great white
sharks and some of the other sharks,

3378
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:05,193
um,
we've just completely off balance the 

3379
02:22:06,711 --> 02:22:11,390
situation because that's what they eat.
I'm sure.

3380
02:22:11,630 --> 02:22:12,463
Well,
anytime people intervene in the natural 

3381
02:22:14,061 --> 02:22:18,170
world and step in and do one thing and 
not the others,

3382
02:22:18,410 --> 02:22:20,430
we have to intervene sometimes.
I mean we have,

3383
02:22:20,510 --> 02:22:23,210
we get animals,
they just don't manage themselves.

3384
02:22:23,211 --> 02:22:25,770
What I mean by intervene is like what 
they did in Australia where they brought

3385
02:22:25,771 --> 02:22:29,880
over a feral cats to control the rats 
and rabbits and then they started eating

3386
02:22:29,881 --> 02:22:30,714
the ground nesting birds,
so they bring in fox is to try to kill 

3387
02:22:32,821 --> 02:22:36,890
the cats and the foxes kill everything,
but the cats and ga's us.

3388
02:22:38,190 --> 02:22:41,790
Why did they bring the way?
It's a long story,

3389
02:22:41,820 --> 02:22:42,653
but they brought in rabbits in Australia
and the rabbit population got out of 

3390
02:22:47,221 --> 02:22:49,920
control and then they brought in cats 
deal with the rabbits,

3391
02:22:49,921 --> 02:22:51,600
but the cast didn't just eat the 
rabbits.

3392
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:52,433
They also started decimating the ground 
nesting birds and all the other local 

3393
02:22:55,621 --> 02:22:56,454
rodents and then they brought another 
things to deal with the cats and now 

3394
02:22:59,281 --> 02:23:03,000
hunters are like,
Australia is weird.

3395
02:23:03,350 --> 02:23:06,880
They're hunting magazines.
Water buffalo are not from there.

3396
02:23:06,990 --> 02:23:08,040
That's true too.
From asia.

3397
02:23:08,041 --> 02:23:08,874
Everything in Australia.
So the stags and crocodiles heard right 

3398
02:23:12,190 --> 02:23:14,250
there.
Some of the big american crocodile.

3399
02:23:14,251 --> 02:23:19,230
we're not sure about that,
but I think they're from Australia.

3400
02:23:19,470 --> 02:23:20,303
I don't know about that.
Salt water crocs are huge and there's a 

3401
02:23:21,850 --> 02:23:25,700
bigger american alligator and american 
alligator over there.

3402
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:26,673
They have alligators and Australia,
I believe there are no red and then I'm 

3403
02:23:29,521 --> 02:23:30,354
not sure about that,
but I do know that they show cats in 

3404
02:23:34,711 --> 02:23:37,470
their hunting magazines.
They're hunting magazines.

3405
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:39,780
Dudes hold up catholic.
I got one might like,

3406
02:23:39,781 --> 02:23:43,680
and they think it's cool,
but it's the same as in America.

3407
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:47,760
If you killed like a coyote that's 
killing all the neighborhood pets,

3408
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:48,893
people would shoot it with a bow and 
arrow and then take a picture of it and 

3409
02:23:50,731 --> 02:23:51,690
they'd be happy.
Yeah.

3410
02:23:51,691 --> 02:23:53,800
Good.
You got that fucking kitty cat,

3411
02:23:53,801 --> 02:23:54,634
eaton coyote.
But that's how these people are in 

3412
02:23:56,461 --> 02:23:59,620
Australia with a cat.
It's all just culturally relative.

3413
02:23:59,890 --> 02:24:00,490
It's,
it's,

3414
02:24:00,490 --> 02:24:03,170
it's no different.
When we were there last time I was there

3415
02:24:03,630 --> 02:24:06,030
had this big,
a white stallion,

3416
02:24:06,150 --> 02:24:07,650
abrahm bs,
what they could sell.

3417
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,910
Just a horse,
you know,

3418
02:24:08,940 --> 02:24:10,500
coming and uh,
you know,

3419
02:24:10,501 --> 02:24:11,340
adam's telling me,
he's like,

3420
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:12,930
oh man,
that's,

3421
02:24:12,980 --> 02:24:14,370
that's a trophy.
You should,

3422
02:24:14,460 --> 02:24:15,870
you should kill that thing.
And I'm like,

3423
02:24:15,960 --> 02:24:18,540
why didn't kill a freaking horse dude?
And it's like,

3424
02:24:18,990 --> 02:24:20,490
but it's a brumby.
I mean,

3425
02:24:20,491 --> 02:24:22,500
so that's.
And it was by itself.

3426
02:24:22,530 --> 02:24:24,000
It was,
it looked awesome.

3427
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:27,600
It comes all the way up.
I'm praying it would go somewhere else.

3428
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:28,950
No,
it comes 20 yards.

3429
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:33,220
I couldn't do it,
but that's just because you know,

3430
02:24:33,360 --> 02:24:35,480
where we grow up,
where we left the condition to,

3431
02:24:35,550 --> 02:24:38,160
to them horses too.
Then that's just,

3432
02:24:38,220 --> 02:24:39,810
you know,
that's something to hunt.

3433
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:43,740
It's I ate at joe beef and montreal,
the restaurant.

3434
02:24:43,830 --> 02:24:46,650
It's a great restaurant.
Montreal and they serve horse.

3435
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:48,780
They served a,
they had horse,

3436
02:24:48,781 --> 02:24:52,950
a horse loin and uh,
they also served horse tar tar.

3437
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:55,890
So it was like raw horse and the horse 
loin.

3438
02:24:55,891 --> 02:24:56,730
And we were like,
ooh,

3439
02:24:57,260 --> 02:25:00,560
it's an amazing restaurant.
But they're like super creative with the

3440
02:25:00,570 --> 02:25:03,330
dishes.
And both times I was there,

3441
02:25:03,331 --> 02:25:05,780
they gave us a horse.
No,

3442
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:07,950
I can't do horse.
I like horses.

3443
02:25:08,130 --> 02:25:08,963
It was one of the biggest problems we 
ever had on fear factor we made keep 

3444
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:13,860
lead.
Horse rectum can always.

3445
02:25:14,020 --> 02:25:15,600
Yes.
I remember that.

3446
02:25:15,630 --> 02:25:19,260
Oh my god.
Remember that show don't ripped a huge.

3447
02:25:19,261 --> 02:25:21,600
People were furious.
So sure it was.

3448
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:25,540
That was the stop because it was for.
Because not because his rectum,

3449
02:25:25,541 --> 02:25:28,810
because this horse pig rectum was fine.
Not a peep out of people.

3450
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:32,420
Nobody said a damn thing,
but horse rectum,

3451
02:25:32,460 --> 02:25:33,430
a huge issue.
Hey,

3452
02:25:33,431 --> 02:25:35,780
you want to cause more problems?
how about behr rectum?

3453
02:25:38,710 --> 02:25:40,120
You wouldn't want that?
No.

3454
02:25:40,820 --> 02:25:41,740
Baron?
No.

3455
02:25:42,370 --> 02:25:43,630
Why is horse better?
I don't know.

3456
02:25:43,690 --> 02:25:48,000
Did that that showed you that show a 
just fizzle out because you wanted.

3457
02:25:48,010 --> 02:25:49,480
You were done with it or was it.
No,

3458
02:25:49,490 --> 02:25:50,323
it fizzled out the first time because it
had just did a 148 episodes and it was 

3459
02:25:53,951 --> 02:25:54,784
just enough,
was enough and they never really got 

3460
02:25:55,751 --> 02:25:56,584
canceled.
We just kind of stopped doing it and 

3461
02:25:58,211 --> 02:25:59,050
everybody was done.
Well,

3462
02:25:59,150 --> 02:25:59,983
I was just fucking stop and we walked 
away from it and then several years 

3463
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:04,033
later it came back.
We did six episodes and it was canceled 

3464
02:26:06,461 --> 02:26:08,980
because we made people drink.
Come.

3465
02:26:09,930 --> 02:26:14,930
What made them drink donkey?
Donkey come and donkey urine.

3466
02:26:15,970 --> 02:26:18,010
Nobody had a problem with the urine 
oddly enough.

3467
02:26:18,490 --> 02:26:19,323
Really.
It's like relatively normal comparison 

3468
02:26:21,881 --> 02:26:23,180
to the con,
but that was it.

3469
02:26:23,770 --> 02:26:24,603
Tmz got ahold of some of the photos,
some leaked photos with the donkey 

3470
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:30,280
episode and put it up there.

3471
02:26:30,310 --> 02:26:32,260
What did you call it?
Do not,

3472
02:26:32,261 --> 02:26:35,740
do not remember.
I think I seen sperm,

3473
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:39,500
sperm or semen or whatever the fuck.
That's disgusting.

3474
02:26:40,490 --> 02:26:41,323
Um,
and that was the people that I was at 

3475
02:26:42,850 --> 02:26:45,100
the studio of other people did it,
right.

3476
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:45,960
Oh,
yay.

3477
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:48,100
All three of them did it.
All three of them did it.

3478
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:49,210
Yeah.
It was enough.

3479
02:26:49,210 --> 02:26:50,470
You gotta get outta here,
don't you?

3480
02:26:50,490 --> 02:26:52,870
You've got to go to conan.
Leaving soon.

3481
02:26:53,090 --> 02:26:54,580
Yeah.
Pretty sorry.

3482
02:26:54,790 --> 02:26:56,950
When does a,
let's get away from drinking.

3483
02:26:56,980 --> 02:26:59,230
Come.
This is troubling.

3484
02:26:59,930 --> 02:27:00,763
even to me.
I'm one of the very few people in 

3485
02:27:02,651 --> 02:27:03,484
hollywood or anywhere in the world that 
can say I lost a job because people had 

3486
02:27:06,341 --> 02:27:07,330
a drink.
Come on tv.

3487
02:27:07,331 --> 02:27:08,560
Yeah,
that's true.

3488
02:27:08,630 --> 02:27:11,170
That's true.
what's hilarious is that nbc said yes to

3489
02:27:11,171 --> 02:27:13,090
that.
They all signed off.

3490
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:16,050
THat got passed through whatever 
lawyers,

3491
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:20,170
quality control.
A lot of people,

3492
02:27:20,410 --> 02:27:24,700
you know,
certain genders,

3493
02:27:24,701 --> 02:27:27,070
drink come all the time.
Both,

3494
02:27:27,250 --> 02:27:28,083
both genders.
That's unlike the people are either 

3495
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:35,340
switching it up.

3496
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:42,153
The fate of the furious April 14th,
that's when it comes out this friday or 

3497
02:27:45,880 --> 02:27:48,640
vin diesel and the rocket odds in this 
photo,

3498
02:27:48,641 --> 02:27:49,474
I can't tell.
It seems like there was that piece that 

3499
02:27:51,830 --> 02:27:55,990
I read or was that real and it's all,
it's all just don't believe,

3500
02:27:56,080 --> 02:28:00,190
don't believe on the internet.
Some real issues.

3501
02:28:00,410 --> 02:28:01,243
Those two,
then two alphas collided on the set and 

3502
02:28:04,061 --> 02:28:06,160
vin diesel wouldn't take off the 
sunglasses even at night.

3503
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:08,230
It was so strange.
Yeah.

3504
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:11,430
It's fucking dope cars though,
man did.

3505
02:28:11,470 --> 02:28:13,230
So um,
he took off his necklace.

3506
02:28:13,240 --> 02:28:14,073
A pay attention to that.
What kind of cars they have in this 

3507
02:28:15,521 --> 02:28:17,020
episode.
Oh,

3508
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:19,060
is that a charger with the flared 
fenders?

3509
02:28:19,061 --> 02:28:19,894
Yeah.
You got like sort of seeped in charge 

3510
02:28:20,831 --> 02:28:21,664
there in charge.
I got that sucker was on display 

3511
02:28:24,291 --> 02:28:25,670
somewhere.
Right?

3512
02:28:25,700 --> 02:28:28,640
That charger isn't on display somewhere.
It might've been.

3513
02:28:28,670 --> 02:28:29,503
I mean it's,
it's one of the hero cars and fucking 

3514
02:28:31,311 --> 02:28:32,210
insane car.

3515
02:28:32,220 --> 02:28:33,750
Like,
oh my god,

3516
02:28:33,751 --> 02:28:34,610
that's pretty sexy,
right?

3517
02:28:34,670 --> 02:28:36,180
That looks good.
Yeah.

3518
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,313
Those,
those american cars from the late 

3519
02:28:39,591 --> 02:28:40,850
sixties,
early seventies.

3520
02:28:40,851 --> 02:28:43,700
You just can't get anything like that 
sexy.

3521
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:45,080
God.
Amazing.

3522
02:28:45,110 --> 02:28:46,980
Yeah.
That one's got a custom grill to look at

3523
02:28:46,981 --> 02:28:49,250
that grill on that soccer.
Whoa.

3524
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:50,900
No ram truck,
huh?

3525
02:28:51,390 --> 02:28:54,560
No camps.
A fan of the ram trucks.

3526
02:28:55,640 --> 02:28:57,640
I like try like cells.
Yeah,

3527
02:28:57,641 --> 02:28:59,780
I do too,
but they just don't.

3528
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:00,990
There's something about,
you know,

3529
02:29:01,010 --> 02:29:03,350
you can't get a ram truck with a 
supercharger popping out of the hood.

3530
02:29:03,351 --> 02:29:05,920
Like that big hole blower.
Look,

3531
02:29:05,940 --> 02:29:07,360
they're fighting.
Oh no,

3532
02:29:07,370 --> 02:29:08,660
that's jason statham.
Nevermind.

3533
02:29:08,930 --> 02:29:09,763
oh jason.
Say those fighting who rock something 

3534
02:29:11,571 --> 02:29:12,810
that's out there.
That's the rock.

3535
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:15,490
But brown.
Well,

3536
02:29:15,740 --> 02:29:19,970
pretend he's block.
He's got baby oil on and jason stayed.

3537
02:29:20,340 --> 02:29:21,980
I would help to pull them aside and go,
hey,

3538
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:22,933
run.

3539
02:29:24,590 --> 02:29:25,850
Run.
Run the other way.

3540
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:27,890
But he,
he fights.

3541
02:29:28,630 --> 02:29:30,080
He's got a martial arts background for 
sure.

3542
02:29:30,450 --> 02:29:31,283
Yeah.
Yeah.

3543
02:29:31,630 --> 02:29:34,400
Jason statham can fight for sure,
but still run.

3544
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:36,260
Hey,
look at that rocks.

3545
02:29:36,580 --> 02:29:39,850
We'll get that pastor jesus christ 
features on that guy.

3546
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:44,860
But young clint eastwood.
You handsome fellow?

3547
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:48,740
I don't understand why so upset.
Angry.

3548
02:29:48,860 --> 02:29:50,390
I don't know.
The hollywood guys are angry.

3549
02:29:50,391 --> 02:29:52,160
I don't know why.
It's like,

3550
02:29:54,100 --> 02:29:56,310
so what's next for you?
Like what do you,

3551
02:29:56,330 --> 02:29:58,400
what do you got goIng on after this 
schedule?

3552
02:29:58,850 --> 02:30:01,040
I'm not going to take some time off.
I'm going to.

3553
02:30:01,070 --> 02:30:03,800
I'm going to see my father.
Come on,

3554
02:30:03,810 --> 02:30:04,643
son.
I'm going to get a comment on if you 

3555
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:12,040
come to go to Hawaii,
he's going to go kill bears.

3556
02:30:13,770 --> 02:30:14,321
No,
no,

3557
02:30:14,321 --> 02:30:15,260
no.
I'm not going to do that.

3558
02:30:15,261 --> 02:30:16,570
Don't say that life.
Oh,

3559
02:30:18,100 --> 02:30:18,933
he's mad when I met.
He's not going to kill bears under any 

3560
02:30:22,641 --> 02:30:23,474
circumstance.

3561
02:30:23,610 --> 02:30:25,790
We're just going to shoot over their 
head and then take a picture of it.

3562
02:30:25,860 --> 02:30:26,693
So try to scare them off so I can't kill
them and let them know where the moose 

3563
02:30:31,790 --> 02:30:32,960
babies are.
Right?

3564
02:30:33,080 --> 02:30:35,330
All those country little movements that 
you love to eat.

3565
02:30:35,810 --> 02:30:37,390
Go get 'em.
Go get 'em.

3566
02:30:37,430 --> 02:30:38,121
Nice,
sweet,

3567
02:30:38,121 --> 02:30:40,740
friendly bear.
Can go eat those bare.

3568
02:30:40,940 --> 02:30:43,550
Those babies.
Babies you don't loose.

3569
02:30:43,690 --> 02:30:44,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

3570
02:30:45,050 --> 02:30:45,883
So,
um,

3571
02:30:45,990 --> 02:30:46,823
so yeah.
Would you not hunt bear because of the 

3572
02:30:48,310 --> 02:30:53,310
blowback it look at hunting.
Anything I'll eat.

3573
02:30:54,110 --> 02:30:55,460
You know,
I never say never,

3574
02:30:56,450 --> 02:30:58,400
but I'm ict bear.
Yeah.

3575
02:30:58,401 --> 02:31:00,470
He can eat better.
Bear sausage is good man.

3576
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:02,170
Telling you like black pair in 
particular.

3577
02:31:02,200 --> 02:31:05,560
I get people say it doesn't taste good,
does it?

3578
02:31:05,930 --> 02:31:08,720
You eat it with the,
with the rivets.

3579
02:31:08,721 --> 02:31:12,230
We have some amazing bear meat dishes.
I mean,

3580
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:13,313
jesus,
it's like you'd think it was the best 

3581
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:16,073
day ever.

3582
02:31:16,180 --> 02:31:17,480
The stir fry.
The means.

3583
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:19,830
That was amazing.
Yeah.

3584
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:22,530
Sausages.
I have a bare summer sausage.

3585
02:31:22,531 --> 02:31:24,600
That's amazing.
Bear regular sausage.

3586
02:31:24,750 --> 02:31:26,160
Italian sweet sausage.
Unfair.

3587
02:31:26,250 --> 02:31:27,520
It's fucking good man.
Yeah.

3588
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:28,680
Yeah.
I bet.

3589
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:31,590
And people just are not buying it.
Look at.

3590
02:31:31,900 --> 02:31:32,733
No,
no.

3591
02:31:32,820 --> 02:31:34,030
He's like,
I'm not shooting a bare bed.

3592
02:31:35,430 --> 02:31:39,090
That's wait until the publicist losing 
her mind somewhere.

3593
02:31:40,350 --> 02:31:42,720
That's why we took her off air.
Yeah,

3594
02:31:43,390 --> 02:31:44,840
we're off air.
Yeah,

3595
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:46,133
but is that why?
Because you would have anything to eat 

3596
02:31:47,641 --> 02:31:49,950
and you wouldn't hunt that because you 
wouldn't need it.

3597
02:31:50,070 --> 02:31:50,401
Well,
no,

3598
02:31:50,401 --> 02:31:51,330
I just,
I never had bear.

3599
02:31:51,850 --> 02:31:53,730
Maybe it's awesome.
Your bear sausage.

3600
02:31:53,731 --> 02:31:55,800
You can say shit.
I'll give you some real.

3601
02:31:55,980 --> 02:31:57,990
It really is good man.
And it's um,

3602
02:31:58,050 --> 02:32:00,630
the,
the thing is it's also an important tool

3603
02:32:00,631 --> 02:32:03,870
for conservation because they really do 
need to keep those populations down.

3604
02:32:03,871 --> 02:32:05,310
Especially in alberta.
Yeah.

3605
02:32:05,310 --> 02:32:07,590
Tons of bear up there.
People think that like,

3606
02:32:07,591 --> 02:32:08,424
I go outside,
I don't see any bear bear populations 

3607
02:32:09,931 --> 02:32:12,390
are so diminished because you're not 
where they are.

3608
02:32:12,391 --> 02:32:14,190
If you go with the other goddamn 
everywhere,

3609
02:32:14,191 --> 02:32:15,001
that's what I said.
I go,

3610
02:32:15,001 --> 02:32:15,834
yeah,
you're not going to see a grizzly at 

3611
02:32:16,231 --> 02:32:18,030
starbucks,
but you know,

3612
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:19,830
hey,
go up to Alaska,

3613
02:32:19,870 --> 02:32:21,960
you're going to see plenty,
and they managed.

3614
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:25,590
Jamie played that video of that guy 
that's sitting.

3615
02:32:25,650 --> 02:32:28,740
He's a photographer and he's a by a 
river.

3616
02:32:28,770 --> 02:32:29,603
You take up and they pan out to the rest
of the river and you see like a dozen 

3617
02:32:33,990 --> 02:32:37,410
grizzlies wandering through this river 
jack and all these salmon.

3618
02:32:37,660 --> 02:32:38,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

3619
02:32:38,910 --> 02:32:43,290
First of all,
what the fuck you imagine you're sitting

3620
02:32:43,291 --> 02:32:44,124
there.
This thing just pulls up within 15 feet 

3621
02:32:45,451 --> 02:32:46,284
of you.
You are only alive because it chooses 

3622
02:32:49,351 --> 02:32:51,990
not to eat you because it's got a belly 
full of salmon.

3623
02:32:52,470 --> 02:32:55,380
So this guy is sitting there.
This bear just,

3624
02:32:55,381 --> 02:32:57,330
he has to chase it off.
He has to yell at it.

3625
02:32:57,520 --> 02:33:01,110
It's feet away from him and easily a 
thousand pounds.

3626
02:33:01,111 --> 02:33:02,550
It's an enormous bear,
right?

3627
02:33:02,551 --> 02:33:07,110
Yeah.
And if it had that right to kill you.

3628
02:33:07,170 --> 02:33:10,000
I mean it's not like you can look at a 
bear and tell.

3629
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:12,270
It's not like a dog with a wagging tail.
I mean,

3630
02:33:12,271 --> 02:33:14,280
you don't know that bear could think,
uh,

3631
02:33:14,340 --> 02:33:16,500
I just don't feel like killing you next 
time.

3632
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:17,221
Okay.
Yeah,

3633
02:33:17,221 --> 02:33:18,220
I'll kill you.
I mean there's,

3634
02:33:18,260 --> 02:33:20,790
there's no difference.
Our big bear family,

3635
02:33:20,850 --> 02:33:21,683
best buddies,
but people see this stuff and they 

3636
02:33:24,001 --> 02:33:24,834
think,
you know,

3637
02:33:24,970 --> 02:33:28,920
barriers were friends with them.
got up there.

3638
02:33:28,960 --> 02:33:30,390
Who's the mayor?
Right.

3639
02:33:31,050 --> 02:33:33,690
And you can't find the guy.
Yeah.

3640
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:35,730
Timothy treadwell.
Did you ever see that documentary?

3641
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,810
The grizzly man losing anybody listening
to this who hasn't seen it?

3642
02:33:40,190 --> 02:33:40,830
This is what you do.

3643
02:33:40,830 --> 02:33:41,663
You smoke some of that devil's cabbage 
and you sit in front of the old netflix 

3644
02:33:44,580 --> 02:33:45,413
and he watched grizzly man because it is
a god damn unintentional comedy really 

3645
02:33:49,921 --> 02:33:51,460
is.
It's an unintentional comedy.

3646
02:33:51,500 --> 02:33:52,333
So many comedic beats in that movie.
I was supposed to interview werner 

3647
02:33:54,511 --> 02:33:55,344
herzog.
He was on a tour last summer and this 

3648
02:33:57,990 --> 02:33:58,823
past didn't work out and we,
we'd never wound up doing the podcast 

3649
02:34:01,321 --> 02:34:02,630
together,
but that was the first thing I was going

3650
02:34:02,631 --> 02:34:03,390
to ask him.
I was like,

3651
02:34:03,390 --> 02:34:04,223
come on.
Did you intentionally put comedic beats 

3652
02:34:06,121 --> 02:34:08,970
into that movie?
Because there's one part where there was

3653
02:34:08,971 --> 02:34:09,804
a sheriff.
He goes,

3654
02:34:09,870 --> 02:34:14,870
I thought he was retarded,
that laughing.

3655
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:19,953
He thought he was retarded,
but it gives me after the guy got eaten 

3656
02:34:21,311 --> 02:34:22,144
by the bear because he was up there like
way past when you're supposed to be up 

3657
02:34:24,401 --> 02:34:26,620
there too.
He was out there past friends.

3658
02:34:27,030 --> 02:34:29,650
They were friends.
There's one scene.

3659
02:34:29,830 --> 02:34:31,540
This is mrs chocolate.
Oh,

3660
02:34:31,541 --> 02:34:33,240
this is her poop.
It's right here.

3661
02:34:33,241 --> 02:34:35,470
This came out of her butt and he's like 
picking it up.

3662
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:36,813
He's like,
let's tell warm to warm because it was 

3663
02:34:38,501 --> 02:34:39,334
inside of her and that's just a good 
example of the bear might not kill you 

3664
02:34:44,021 --> 02:34:46,510
just because they don't feel like it,
but when they feel like it,

3665
02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:47,700
it's over.
It's over.

3666
02:34:47,701 --> 02:34:50,560
I mean not a goddamn thing you going to 
do about it.

3667
02:34:50,680 --> 02:34:53,440
Not a god damn thing.
They're a wild animal.

3668
02:34:53,441 --> 02:34:56,170
It's just like it's even the bears that 
we had up in alberta.

3669
02:34:56,230 --> 02:34:58,390
I mean,
you don't know.

3670
02:34:58,420 --> 02:35:01,480
I mean they could decide they're wild 
animals that any at any one.

3671
02:35:01,570 --> 02:35:03,600
There's all different kinds.
There's aggressive bears,

3672
02:35:03,601 --> 02:35:04,434
there's shy bears,
there's bears that you can't really get 

3673
02:35:06,791 --> 02:35:08,320
a read on,
but it's just like a dog.

3674
02:35:08,770 --> 02:35:10,570
You don't know there's good and bad 
bear,

3675
02:35:10,571 --> 02:35:11,910
so it's just the wrong one.
Yeah.

3676
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:14,230
They're like,
all animals have different personalities

3677
02:35:14,231 --> 02:35:15,340
like cats,
dogs,

3678
02:35:15,341 --> 02:35:17,110
domestic animals have weird 
personalities.

3679
02:35:17,240 --> 02:35:19,750
Wild animals do too.
It's just most of them can't kill you,

3680
02:35:19,810 --> 02:35:21,880
but bears can mean that 10.
Yes.

3681
02:35:21,970 --> 02:35:22,830
That's the difference.
Yeah.

3682
02:35:23,980 --> 02:35:26,110
So you're not interested in that.
What about eagleS?

3683
02:35:26,111 --> 02:35:27,550
Ever interested in cooking up an eagle?

3684
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:32,070
Spit balls,
history,

3685
02:35:32,080 --> 02:35:34,300
eagle.
Nothing like a parrot.

3686
02:35:34,330 --> 02:35:36,040
Eagle balls,
balls.

3687
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:38,650
I know that they're male and female,
but did they have testicles?

3688
02:35:39,240 --> 02:35:41,800
Look that up?
is this as important?

3689
02:35:42,590 --> 02:35:43,423
That's important.
Is there a bucket list hunt that you'd 

3690
02:35:45,131 --> 02:35:45,964
like to go on?
Like maybe on an elk hunt and the rocky 

3691
02:35:47,081 --> 02:35:47,914
mountains?
Yeah,

3692
02:35:48,120 --> 02:35:49,240
that'd be,
that'd be awesome.

3693
02:35:49,241 --> 02:35:52,870
I'd tag along and do one of those if I 
can.

3694
02:35:53,350 --> 02:35:54,040
Yeah.
There's um.

3695
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:54,701
well,
you know,

3696
02:35:54,701 --> 02:35:57,520
if you ever do get to Australia,
like they have stag over,

3697
02:35:57,521 --> 02:36:00,760
there are a lot lIke,
like elk and they roar.

3698
02:36:00,830 --> 02:36:02,620
Ever heard the roar?
Oh,

3699
02:36:02,621 --> 02:36:04,420
do they sound like a lion?
Have you?

3700
02:36:04,570 --> 02:36:05,890
You've heard it in real life?
No.

3701
02:36:06,650 --> 02:36:07,590
No.
They look,

3702
02:36:09,060 --> 02:36:10,520
they roar.
It's crazy.

3703
02:36:10,600 --> 02:36:12,610
It's a crazy sound.
Jamie will find it for us.

3704
02:36:12,630 --> 02:36:14,140
We.
We've had some good outcomes,

3705
02:36:14,141 --> 02:36:17,650
so we have.
There's an elk back there.

3706
02:36:17,650 --> 02:36:20,860
I'll show you in the back that we got 
just this past fall.

3707
02:36:21,380 --> 02:36:23,930
A huge thing.
oh my god.

3708
02:36:23,931 --> 02:36:25,570
That's so awesome.
Massive,

3709
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:27,730
massive animal.
And I've got food back there.

3710
02:36:27,731 --> 02:36:28,564
If you want something once,
malcolm brick give you some tell you 

3711
02:36:29,781 --> 02:36:31,570
right the hell yeah.
Because you had it backwards tonight,

3712
02:36:31,571 --> 02:36:32,090
right?
Yep.

3713
02:36:32,090 --> 02:36:34,150
Yeah.
After conan we gotta go do that.

3714
02:36:34,990 --> 02:36:37,780
Is that a stag night?
It's a rocky out on the elk bugling.

3715
02:36:38,410 --> 02:36:41,900
We've heard that before,
but go see a red stag roar.

3716
02:36:42,130 --> 02:36:44,020
Try google red.
There it is.

3717
02:36:44,021 --> 02:36:44,890
Yeah.
Listen to this thing.

3718
02:36:44,980 --> 02:36:47,380
It's crazy.
Look in his face.

3719
02:36:47,381 --> 02:36:49,240
First of all,
look at those goddamn antlers.

3720
02:36:56,120 --> 02:36:56,953
Yes,
he took.

3721
02:36:57,030 --> 02:36:57,863
That's high fan.

3722
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:05,080
What?
What did that rocket?

3723
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:10,350
A big old red lipstick.
Rocket.

3724
02:37:14,070 --> 02:37:15,420
Massive mended that.
Ladies,

3725
02:37:15,421 --> 02:37:16,220
you're so lucky.

3726
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:17,630
Is he bringing it in?
Female.

3727
02:37:17,670 --> 02:37:18,503
They're really trying to.
He's trying to call him and see that 

3728
02:37:20,151 --> 02:37:24,830
quarter to buy my homeboy turbo would 
pound right through that shoulder.

3729
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,210
Ooh.
We'd take that shot.

3730
02:37:26,330 --> 02:37:27,740
Would you take that shot and where would
you go?

3731
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:32,980
Right through the shoulder point to the 
spot right there.

3732
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:35,060
Just right through it.
Yeah,

3733
02:37:35,061 --> 02:37:35,894
it would go right through it.
Cames shooting the most ridiculously 

3734
02:37:38,931 --> 02:37:39,764
powerful setup we were practicing today 
and it's just so evident that these 

3735
02:37:42,471 --> 02:37:44,420
heavy arrows,
so much momentum.

3736
02:37:44,421 --> 02:37:46,940
You're at 687 grains.
Is that what that is?

3737
02:37:46,941 --> 02:37:47,774
Yep.
Yep.

3738
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:49,280
Which is by the way,
you know,

3739
02:37:49,281 --> 02:37:50,114
we were talking grams before and we 
meant to say grains and then we're 

3740
02:37:53,481 --> 02:37:57,620
converting grams to marijuana and 
calculations.

3741
02:37:57,700 --> 02:37:58,533
Just don't mix.
We're doing this a long time ago on a 

3742
02:38:00,681 --> 02:38:02,480
podcast and then I was driving home and 
I was like,

3743
02:38:02,481 --> 02:38:03,314
jesus christ,
do we say grams when I met grains and 

3744
02:38:06,201 --> 02:38:07,034
that we're trying to figure out how many
grams we're in an ounce and they were 

3745
02:38:09,420 --> 02:38:12,700
determining that it was a pound,
like four,

3746
02:38:12,800 --> 02:38:14,860
500 grams in a pound.

3747
02:38:15,170 --> 02:38:16,790
And I'm like,
but arrows not a pound,

3748
02:38:16,791 --> 02:38:17,624
like whatever.
And we just kept talking on something 

3749
02:38:18,821 --> 02:38:21,110
else and then it took me a while to like
figure it out.

3750
02:38:21,230 --> 02:38:23,030
It's like saying I was reading a 
podcast,

3751
02:38:24,110 --> 02:38:26,900
but I'm.
His setup is just preposterous.

3752
02:38:26,901 --> 02:38:30,510
It's unbelievable horsepower today,
man.

3753
02:38:31,490 --> 02:38:34,220
Shooting good hitting that thing is 
pretty cool.

3754
02:38:34,480 --> 02:38:37,640
Now you're ever.
None of them can be age.

3755
02:38:37,660 --> 02:38:39,200
It's not possible.
We'll talk later.

3756
02:38:39,530 --> 02:38:41,390
We'll talk later.
Has a trade secret engineer's.

3757
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:42,990
Oh yeah,
yeah,

3758
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:44,340
I remember you told me.
Oh,

3759
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:45,253
okay.
Yeah,

3760
02:38:45,380 --> 02:38:46,280
we'll talk later.
But yeah,

3761
02:38:46,281 --> 02:38:47,114
we have a.
Our buddy adam that we're talking about 

3762
02:38:48,051 --> 02:38:50,180
before that liveS in Australia and when 
cam goes over there,

3763
02:38:50,181 --> 02:38:52,970
you're goIng to be hunting stag,
stag,

3764
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,310
buffalo and fallow and stags.
Just like an elk.

3765
02:38:55,340 --> 02:38:57,170
I mean it's essentially a real similar 
animal.

3766
02:38:57,230 --> 02:38:58,700
Little smaller.
Yeah,

3767
02:38:58,760 --> 02:38:59,593
but it's.
I mean that is that arthur [inaudible] 

3768
02:39:01,400 --> 02:39:02,380
buffalo though.

3769
02:39:02,540 --> 02:39:03,373
Buffalo is a video of him over there 
hunting a water buffalo from 40 yards 

3770
02:39:08,510 --> 02:39:09,343
and he's creeping up.
See if you find that video because I 

3771
02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:12,343
read that book,
the last american buffalo renelle his 

3772
02:39:13,881 --> 02:39:15,150
book.
You know,

3773
02:39:15,170 --> 02:39:16,940
I've read part of it.
I haven't finished it,

3774
02:39:16,941 --> 02:39:18,950
but I,
I started it and then I put it down.

3775
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:20,730
I never went back to it.
As you get it,

3776
02:39:20,731 --> 02:39:23,990
it's sort of the first half is a little 
funky.

3777
02:39:23,991 --> 02:39:24,824
It's clunky.
It's.

3778
02:39:24,970 --> 02:39:25,803
But the shitty writings.
I was just saying I'll call him right 

3779
02:39:27,501 --> 02:39:32,501
now with kids since you're a cunt.
A shit about what I.

3780
02:39:33,511 --> 02:39:34,740
What I mean is it,
you know,

3781
02:39:36,980 --> 02:39:41,980
to talk about drinking just wouldn't 
shut up.

3782
02:39:43,430 --> 02:39:47,800
He wouldn't shut up about that drink.
Some elk moved on it on.

3783
02:39:49,940 --> 02:39:52,790
He said something about vin diesel was 
one time,

3784
02:39:52,791 --> 02:39:53,624
one time he doesn't like la.
I live in san diego and so this is camp 

3785
02:39:57,651 --> 02:39:58,484
sneaking up on this water buffalo and 
every time it picks up its eyes or it 

3786
02:40:01,521 --> 02:40:03,440
might've caught movement,
he has to pause.

3787
02:40:03,590 --> 02:40:08,590
So this is ridiculously slow truck.
I think I'm.

3788
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:13,540
I think it's still a little bit before I
shoot away.

3789
02:40:13,610 --> 02:40:13,910
No,
no,

3790
02:40:13,910 --> 02:40:14,743
no.

3791
02:40:14,850 --> 02:40:15,683
It's getting closer.
So I got my range finder there so I can 

3792
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:20,100
quickly get it because I'm getting 
closer every time.

3793
02:40:20,580 --> 02:40:22,860
Kim,
what do you think about range finding by

3794
02:40:22,870 --> 02:40:26,100
nose stopped.
had a don't move.

3795
02:40:26,640 --> 02:40:29,520
Don't move with the hall.
If it's coming out.

3796
02:40:29,550 --> 02:40:30,840
You did you hide behind that little 
tree?

3797
02:40:31,020 --> 02:40:33,090
What do you do?
I just wrestle it down.

3798
02:40:33,270 --> 02:40:34,103
Oh look,
a man.

3799
02:40:34,690 --> 02:40:37,040
Scrap wood.
It needs.

3800
02:40:37,730 --> 02:40:40,770
The hit you hAd on your podcast can take
down a wolf.

3801
02:40:40,771 --> 02:40:42,230
What was that guy?
Dan pena.

3802
02:40:42,490 --> 02:40:43,140
Pena.
Yeah.

3803
02:40:43,140 --> 02:40:45,360
He would just dab it in the dick over 
and over again.

3804
02:40:45,450 --> 02:40:48,000
Sat right in the deck.
So he's a creeping up.

3805
02:40:49,020 --> 02:40:49,853
Kim,
what are you thoughts on range finding 

3806
02:40:50,611 --> 02:40:51,900
binary.
Do you ever use those?

3807
02:40:52,350 --> 02:40:53,970
I don't have any.
Would you?

3808
02:40:54,030 --> 02:40:54,863
I mean like I know like there's some 
companies that make some that bow 

3809
02:40:56,810 --> 02:40:59,160
hunters use.
Like leica laika has one that apparently

3810
02:40:59,161 --> 02:41:02,280
has a button on the righthand side so 
you can range and shoot with one hand.

3811
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:03,593
This is adam.
I don't know what he was such that 

3812
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:09,240
shipment would be a trophy.
Here's,

3813
02:41:09,270 --> 02:41:12,960
here's some.
Here's a good illustration of having.

3814
02:41:13,410 --> 02:41:16,260
I dunno,
I dunno what I'm trying to promote here,

3815
02:41:16,410 --> 02:41:20,070
but a hard hitting arrow because if you 
wash when I shoot this buffalo,

3816
02:41:20,490 --> 02:41:21,323
the arrow arcs up and actually hits the 
branch and ricochets and still kills 

3817
02:41:26,611 --> 02:41:27,840
that buffalo.
Wow.

3818
02:41:27,870 --> 02:41:32,870
Watch this.
It's going to hit a ricochet off.

3819
02:41:34,051 --> 02:41:36,390
That still killed us.
Big bastard.

3820
02:41:36,490 --> 02:41:39,090
Wow.
It's sort of deceptive here.

3821
02:41:39,091 --> 02:41:41,490
How many yards do you out?
It's going to be 40.

3822
02:41:42,240 --> 02:41:43,800
Yeah,
it looks like he's like 10 feet in front

3823
02:41:43,801 --> 02:41:44,480
of him.
Right?

3824
02:41:44,480 --> 02:41:47,460
You can,
you can because it's fucking huge.

3825
02:41:47,570 --> 02:41:48,900
Just skip ahead a little bit.
Yeah.

3826
02:41:48,950 --> 02:41:52,440
Skip ahead a little bit loud.
Okay.

3827
02:41:52,660 --> 02:41:53,493
Backup backup.
Because it looks like you already shot 

3828
02:41:55,031 --> 02:41:55,380
at.
Yeah.

3829
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:57,360
Backup.
Backup,

3830
02:41:57,840 --> 02:42:00,490
backup.
Scared.

3831
02:42:00,510 --> 02:42:01,343
Okay.
Watch this.

3832
02:42:04,140 --> 02:42:07,410
See that kind of touched it.
Almost barely grazed it.

3833
02:42:07,440 --> 02:42:08,273
Yeah.
But it affected the flight but still 

3834
02:42:09,931 --> 02:42:13,920
went and pounded in here and uh,
that's right where you want to.

3835
02:42:14,390 --> 02:42:16,710
That's right into the heart.
That's where their heart is.

3836
02:42:17,240 --> 02:42:18,073
Do you think you would have got more 
penetration but didn't graze that 

3837
02:42:19,441 --> 02:42:20,370
branch?
Oh yeah,

3838
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:21,720
for sure.
But still,

3839
02:42:21,721 --> 02:42:23,500
that's a 90 pound ball.
Yeah.

3840
02:42:23,550 --> 02:42:26,280
And it's going in six inches deep into 
the heart.

3841
02:42:26,340 --> 02:42:27,173
Yeah,
probably more than that because those 

3842
02:42:28,141 --> 02:42:29,520
are,
I mean that shoulders.

3843
02:42:30,380 --> 02:42:32,460
I mean it's,
it's in probably 18 inches.

3844
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:35,880
and the thing is like what just 
happened?

3845
02:42:35,881 --> 02:42:37,170
Now it doesn't know.
It just,

3846
02:42:37,290 --> 02:42:38,123
it runs into that thing.
And what's really crazy is that cam was 

3847
02:42:42,331 --> 02:42:45,690
saying that he chewed a piece of meat 
from that animal.

3848
02:42:45,720 --> 02:42:49,230
It was so tough and so strong.
You treat it for a whole half hour.

3849
02:42:49,231 --> 02:42:50,450
One piece.
Yeah.

3850
02:42:50,790 --> 02:42:51,623
As like shoe leather because that this 
is an old bull to tank these things or 

3851
02:42:56,280 --> 02:42:57,630
you know,
I don't know,

3852
02:42:57,660 --> 02:43:00,300
1800 pounds.
So you have to shoot,

3853
02:43:01,050 --> 02:43:04,320
you have to shoot heavy stuff.
So do you think you're going to be doing

3854
02:43:04,321 --> 02:43:05,154
that from now on?
You're going to be going to a heavier 

3855
02:43:06,331 --> 02:43:08,610
arrow are in the range.
Maybe.

3856
02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:09,900
We'll see.
We'll see.

3857
02:43:09,930 --> 02:43:11,360
See how this week or this,
uh,

3858
02:43:11,450 --> 02:43:12,120
this trip works.

3859
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:13,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

3860
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:15,460
So how do we get you out,
scott?

3861
02:43:15,670 --> 02:43:17,710
What do we do?
How we get you out there?

3862
02:43:17,740 --> 02:43:20,200
Bowhunting with cam?
What's the animal?

3863
02:43:20,860 --> 02:43:22,660
I'll,
I'll go and cut for sure.

3864
02:43:23,290 --> 02:43:26,110
Is that a deer hunt with you and molly 
or wherever?

3865
02:43:26,200 --> 02:43:28,700
Wherever you're going to Hawaii.
And I can.

3866
02:43:28,970 --> 02:43:30,770
Let's do it.
Get under armour on board.

3867
02:43:30,771 --> 02:43:31,604
We're all,
we're all wear the clothes and spring 

3868
02:43:33,020 --> 02:43:34,820
smile at ea board.
Could you fire me today?

3869
02:43:34,821 --> 02:43:37,190
Maybe will just quit.
You got to quit your.

3870
02:43:37,440 --> 02:43:38,273
They don't know.
You probably hear I'm at work right and 

3871
02:43:40,270 --> 02:43:41,980
at work right now.
He's punching out of your screen.

3872
02:43:42,250 --> 02:43:44,700
Was a couple of tweets to help help the 
power business.

3873
02:43:46,230 --> 02:43:47,280
We should do that though,
right?

3874
02:43:47,300 --> 02:43:48,061
Yeah,
we should all do.

3875
02:43:48,061 --> 02:43:49,920
That will be fun for sure.
Alright,

3876
02:43:49,980 --> 02:43:51,870
well I'm fast and furious.
Eight.

3877
02:43:51,871 --> 02:43:52,704
It's at April 18th is the premier.
Is that is really fucking cool talking 

3878
02:43:58,621 --> 02:43:58,891
to you,
man.

3879
02:43:58,891 --> 02:44:00,900
I really enjoyed it.
It was finally cam.

3880
02:44:01,020 --> 02:44:02,220
Always a pleasure.
Thank you.

3881
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:03,353
And uh,
we're going to go run and I'm going to 

3882
02:44:04,200 --> 02:44:05,250
cry.
So,

3883
02:44:05,251 --> 02:44:06,084
uh,
enjoy cone and you could Watch scott 

3884
02:44:07,411 --> 02:44:08,970

Bye.
