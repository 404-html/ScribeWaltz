1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
He's like Metro pcs because I see all 
those commercials that they do.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,930
We live right now.
We're live.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,450
We're on the air.
Misha tate were on the air.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,330
I just had to let me take note of the 
world was flat.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,540
She didn't know that the man has been 
holding us down and fucking with us and 

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,891
given us bad information that satellites
are bullshit and that the earth doesn't 

7
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:26,541
rely on gravity,
but it uses electromagnetism to make 

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,930
sure things get stuck.
Where is this coming from?

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,020
The world.
The world does a lot of people out there

10
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:33,570
in the world that are waking up.
Do you know what being woke is?

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,610
Are you aware of being woke or you're 
not?

12
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:38,340
You don't know about being woke.
Jamie's woke stay,

13
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:38,880
woke,
stay.

14
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:39,540
Well,
you got to stay.

15
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,860
Woke.
Stay woke.

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,660
So people think that the earth is flat.

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,890
Yes.
You can all use also use wokeness as you

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,360
could use it as like a.
You could say like,

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,030
I have wokeness.
You know what I'm saying?

20
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,870
Like you just because you're just 
because of the UFC bantamweight champion

21
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:59,871
does not equal your wokeness wokeness 
you're woke bullshit.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,680
But the man has been the earth being 
round each round or its flattest fuck,

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,750
the earth is flat and chem trails or the
government spray in the skies and uh,

24
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,740
there is no gravity.
Here's square and stationary earth.

25
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,150
Was this a new one?
One of the parts of the theory you think

26
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:22,560
about Kim.
Kim chose a real.

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,330
Is that what you're saying?
Well,

28
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,350
I don't know.
I kind of wonder what they are and what 

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,350
are they?
That's a good question.

30
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,350
That's a good question.
The problem is when people take that and

31
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:32,890
then they go right to conspiracy 
question.

32
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,150
I'm not a conspiracy theorist,
but I have questions like I want to know

33
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:41,151
what they are.
When a jet engine flies through the sky 

34
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:42,330
and the jet engine encounters 
condensation in the atmosphere,

35
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,790
it creates an artificial clouds.
It's not an artificial cloud.

36
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:49,791
It's an actual cloud.
And the cloud is a direct reaction to 

37
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,720
the jet engine changing the temperature 
of the air in the atmosphere.

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,940
It is scientifically proven.
It's repeatable.

39
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:58,941
They could do it over and over again.
That's why when you see those things in 

40
00:01:58,941 --> 00:01:59,160
the sky,
those things exist.

41
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,490
When the jet engines passed through the 
condensation and it changes the 

42
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,451
temperature and then they slowly fade 
away or not depending upon how much 

43
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:10,680
moisture is in the atmosphere.
Some places do it and other ones don't.

44
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,950
Well,
because some planes are at different 

45
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,151
altitudes and some point,
you know how clouds exist in some 

46
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:17,151
places,
but they don't exist in other places.

47
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:18,630
There's people,
well maybe there's no connotation.

48
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:19,140
Vegas.
I was like,

49
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:24,141
there's flights coming in all the time 
and you watch a steady stream coming in 

50
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:24,141
and none of them have it,
but then like the little like,

51
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,130
I don't know,
they're like small.

52
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,530
I don't know if they're small planes are
not commercial planes.

53
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,590
The little ones.
Those are the ones that make all the 

54
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:33,590
chem trails,
so I'm like,

55
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:33,590
does that.
Well,

56
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,461
they chem trails.
I don't even know if I'm technically 

57
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:37,461
saying it right now.
I don't know what they are.

58
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:38,140
What do they call them?
They call them contract.

59
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,740
That's the real.
The real like if you ask a scientist,

60
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:43,290
they calm cantrell's.
If you ask conspiracy conspiracy,

61
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,860
people that call him chem trails because
they think they're spraying chemicals in

62
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:51,861
the air,
this is something that I had to like 

63
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:51,861
deeply study for this show that I did.

64
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:53,580
Cultural questions about this for a long
time.

65
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:58,581
I've heard so many.
I've heard obviously most of the 

66
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:00,070
conspiracy part of it,
everybody hears about it.

67
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,140
Everybody here is.
I've heard that they're trying to like 

68
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,040
control the weather with it somehow by 
putting gas.

69
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:11,041
Part of the problem is that they are 
trying to control the weather in 

70
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:11,170
different parts of the world.
They spray,

71
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,490
they do what's called cloud seeding,
but cloud seeding is very different than

72
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:20,491
what you're seeing when you see these 
artificial clouds with cloud seeding is 

73
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:24,000
they'll spray a certain type of chemical
into in into the atmosphere that will 

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,010
create rain and they do it in Abu Dhabi.
Abu Dhabi,

75
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,370
they actually do it every every week.
They do it once,

76
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:33,640
so they've done it like 52 times a year 
and it makes rain.

77
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,280
Yeah.
That's been going on for a long time,

78
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:40,090
but that's very different than these 
artificial clouds that are being created

79
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:40,690
by jets.

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,150
That's just a side effect for you 
though.

81
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:45,790
Like the artificial travel,
artificial jets or the rain?

82
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,790
Rain.
Rain.

83
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,910
Well it's silver.
Iodine I think and some other stuff that

84
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,900
they find like find a breathe in and 
stuff.

85
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,130
Yeah,
I'm sure it's not any better than jet 

86
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,451
fuel.
It's burning in your sky above your 

87
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:00,451
child.
That's the real problem.

88
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:04,310
Yeah,
and the gas drive in here and all that 

89
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:04,630
gets people that live near airplanes or 
airports rather.

90
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,660
They have a significantly higher rate of
lung infections and lung diseases and 

91
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,290
lung disorders like adjusting like how 
far.

92
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,650
Now I'm thinking about how far I live 
from the Vegas airport.

93
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,180
It takes me like 20 minutes to get 
there.

94
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:17,640
Fifteen minutes.
Is that too close?

95
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,840
I'll be okay.
Well I think we're all fucked.

96
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,950
Yeah,
we're all fucked.

97
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,440
We're all breathing and under the same 
flat.

98
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,050
Exactly.
Under the same flat earth.

99
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,330
Well that's one of the problems with the
whole chem trail theory.

100
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:30,850
Like don't they live down here too?
They're spraying this guy's like,

101
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:34,660
what are they trying to do and the 
either the ideas there is either weather

102
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:39,661
modification or that they're trying to 
change our behavior that some people 

103
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:40,450
think it's their change.
Like it's,

104
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,330
it's something to do with crops too or 
something and they're trying to.

105
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,910
I don't know,
the growing crops in Vegas,

106
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,090
I don't think they grow shit in Vegas.
Tumble weeds,

107
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,330
they probably got it now.
It's probably a lot of pot grown in 

108
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:54,760
vegas probably is.
It used to be so illegal,

109
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,240
like if you went to vegas you have to be
like really careful about having weed,

110
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,150
but now when you drive around they have 
these giant weed Dr.

111
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,890
Bill Boards and show.
It's really weird.

112
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:03,100
It's like

113
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,870
the call one 800 hot babe on one side 
and then Dr.

114
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,320
Weed on the other side.
That's a weird place to live,

115
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,850
isn't it?
It is,

116
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,450
but it's,
it's.

117
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,630
I feel like Vegas is kind of what you 
make it is whatever you make it.

118
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:21,631
Like if you want to go down to the strip
and be crazy and be wild and hang out 

119
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:22,810
with all the hooligans that are there 
for the weekend,

120
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:24,350
you can,
but if not,

121
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,650
just live in your little house and go 
hike the red rocks and go down to the 

122
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,600
lake.
It's pretty barren.

123
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,620
Pretty Ugly Lake.
Honestly.

124
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:35,050
It came from Washington state,
so I'm used to a lot of greenery.

125
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,650
It's beautiful there and we've got the 
San Juan islands and you could go whale 

126
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,290
watching and she's gorgeous,
but it reminds me too much.

127
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,940
We have a national rain forest up there 
too.

128
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,900
It's beautiful.

129
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,390
Yeah.
I'm a big fan of Washington state.

130
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,740
The rain can fuck with your head,
right?

131
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,030
Yeah.
I couldn't.

132
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,750
I lived there for.
I mean I was 18 before I moved to the 

133
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,080
eastern side,
which is very different.

134
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,260
A lot of people don't know this,
so the mountain range divide sustain 

135
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,260
half and on the east side,
east side of Washington,

136
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,470
that's super dry.
It's like deserty,

137
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,130
like there's actually tumbleweeds and 
sand dunes and all that.

138
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:12,190
It's completely different.
On the other side of Washington and 

139
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,190
moisture comes in from the ocean,
hits the mountains,

140
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,960
rolls back over rains like double duty 
on the west side.

141
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:19,370
And the east side of wash of Washington 
is really dry year from spokane,

142
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:20,030
right?
No,

143
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,430
I'm from Tacoma,
Tacoma,

144
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,940
Compton.
To call it people call it.

145
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:27,590
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

146
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,390
Yeah,
it is.

147
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,900
It's pretty ghetto.
But I lived on the edge.

148
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,170
It's really big actually.
It's um,

149
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,900
I think if I'm not mistaken,
I should probably know this things,

150
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:37,710
but I don't pay attention to a lot of 
things.

151
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,770
You'll probably find out,
I don't know,

152
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,520
a lot of statistics and stuff.
I'm kind of like,

153
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:44,300
well it was fly by the seat of my pants,
like whatever's going on.

154
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,530
It's cool.
But I think it's,

155
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,850
it's one of the biggest circumvents the 
whitest cities,

156
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:52,680
like not most populated but like most 
area in Washington anyway,

157
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:57,681
so on.
I live on the very outskirts like near 

158
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:57,681
Puyallup.
So I grew up on like five acres and like

159
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:59,000
I had some land,
it wasn't like in the heart of it,

160
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,170
but it's a pretty cool place.

161
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,680
So going from there to live in Vegas,
but I guess like as a professional 

162
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,361
fighter,
your days are probably so filled with 

163
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:12,791
training and recovery and being like,
how much time do you have actually have 

164
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:15,260
to even be in the city that you're in?

165
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,100
Like none.
None.

166
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,900
I'm in camp really not much.
Maybe on the weekends sometimes.

167
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:25,901
That's what's nice about it too is you 
can go down there and just enjoy comedy 

168
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:27,080
show.
I mean you come through often,

169
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:32,081
like a lot of acts come through.
Kevin Hart comes through a lot of 

170
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:32,081
musicians,
a lot of concerts.

171
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:34,100
So it's nice because everyone comes to 
you essentially.

172
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:35,540
You don't have to go travel and see 
anyone.

173
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:40,541
So if you want to just set the cup down 
for a minute and take a break from the 

174
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,290
chain gang or would it go ride the,
the,

175
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,410
you know,
the big ferris wheel that they have 

176
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:46,910
there,
the on the link,

177
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,790
they want to go ride that or do 
whatever,

178
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,700
you know.
Um,

179
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,050
it's nice because there's always so much
going on as long as you stay outside of 

180
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,990
it like Henderson or something like 
that.

181
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,010
I live in mountains edge.
Um,

182
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,400
so yeah,
for the most part I don't ever even see 

183
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,411
this trip unless I'm driving by it.
Like to go visit the UFC offices or 

184
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:08,411
something like that.

185
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:09,520
Well it's a good place to live as a 
professional fighter.

186
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:11,110
Right?
Because there's a lot of gyms there.

187
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:16,111
There's a lot of great training there.
This across the board strength and 

188
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:16,620
conditioning and Thai boxing.

189
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,680
One is the home of the UFC so it's nice 
to not because there's a lot of 

190
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,760
extracurricular things that I get to 
take part of because I'm,

191
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,790
I'm local.
I could do a lot more charity things and

192
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,020
with the boys and girls club and you 
know,

193
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,610
just going in,
you know,

194
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,800
being a part of the year.
See,

195
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:33,480
I guess I get to,
I get to do more things.

196
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,140
Yeah.
No,

197
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,650
your life is very different right now 
that it was a year ago.

198
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,480
It is.
How crazy is that?

199
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,570
Yeah.
You a year ago you were talking about 

200
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:45,570
like not doing this anymore.
You will.

201
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,570
I've got to figure out what I'm doing 
right now.

202
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,140
You're the fucking world champ.
Fricking

203
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,840
one 80.
Yeah.

204
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:55,530
My,
my career in life,

205
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,110
we couldn't have been different a year 
ago than it is now,

206
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,190
you know,
strangers that,

207
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,550
how that can just in an instant,
you just never know.

208
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,850
What does that feel like?
It's like when you wake up in the 

209
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,030
morning,
so you have to go to the belts

210
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,750
for real.
I'm happy.

211
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,550
It's um,
it's enlightening.

212
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:18,560
It's fun.
It's great to be the champ.

213
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,790
I,
I love it.

214
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,640
Honestly.
It's a completely different thing.

215
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:21,980
It,
yeah.

216
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,950
You know,
a year ago I was so frustrated because,

217
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,870
you know,
when I lost her onto the last time,

218
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:29,220
I knew I had a lot,
a long road you to,

219
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,880
to work my way back up.
But I thought I had done that and when I

220
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:32,700
beat Jessica,
I,

221
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,560
it was announced.
It's like,

222
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:38,561
you know,
this is going to be then the number one 

223
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:38,561
contender eliminator fight.
And then afterwards they were like,

224
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:39,440
yes it is.
You're going to fight Ronda.

225
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,950
Then I felt like the carpet was kind of 
just pulled out from under my feet 

226
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:44,950
because they were like,
just kidding holly.

227
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,900
Holly's fighting.
And they announced it without telling 

228
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:49,900
me.
So that's why I was so upset.

229
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:49,900
I was like,
I don't take that shit lightly.

230
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,810
Like I was training my ass off already.
I had already reached out to um,

231
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,410
a girl in France,
I can't say her name right.

232
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:58,550
I think it's like Jeffery,
I don't know some French name,

233
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:03,551
but she beat Ronda and judo.
So I had already been making plans with 

234
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:05,340
her to train with her and fire over here
and choose changing things.

235
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:06,950
Then I was like,
I felt like such an ass,

236
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,980
like I feel like an idiot,
like I look like an idiot because here 

237
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,470
the announcement was made and I didn't 
even know.

238
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,630
So I was kind of upset about that.
But you know,

239
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:16,370
we talked about and we smoothed things 
over and,

240
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,690
and I took it personally at the time,
but I don't think it was meant 

241
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,220
personally and it was a business 
decision and I understand that,

242
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:25,610
that at the end of the day that's what 
it was and it all worked out.

243
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:25,910
So

244
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:31,010
the UFC is in a weird position because 
they're both a promoter and sort of a 

245
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:35,091
sanctioning body.
And that's really rare and matter of 

246
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:38,571
fact,
I can't think of any other sport where 

247
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:38,571
that exists.
Yeah.

248
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:42,030
You know,
they have just this ability to decide 

249
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,051
like they'll,
they'll just decide like this person 

250
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:47,811
gets a show.
Like the whole conor mcgregor situation 

251
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:48,720
is a perfect example of that.
Like all of a sudden if he had beat nate

252
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:53,721
diaz or if he had beaten dos Anjos dos 
Anjos didn't get injured and he beat 

253
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:56,280
beat Dosantos you fucking know for sure 
they were going to have him fight Robbie

254
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,010
lawler.
Yeah,

255
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,900
for sure.
And they were just going to like,

256
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,370
figure out a way to do something with 
145 Palm Tata.

257
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,160
And why wouldn't they do it if there are
business people,

258
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:08,280
because that's where the money is.
I mean it would have been if he had beat

259
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:11,730
dos Anjos and then went on and fought 
Robbie lawler,

260
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:12,660
Jesus Christ.

261
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,110
When you talk about like a $5 million 
paper view by event,

262
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,060
they'd have to do it.
It would be insane.

263
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:23,270
But if that was like a sanctioning body,
like you've seen it before in like 

264
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,531
boxing,
like someone won't take a mandatory 

265
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:28,170
challenger and they get stripped even 
when they just won the title,

266
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:33,171
it happens all the time.
Like we're a phyto would just win the 

267
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:34,680
title and then they have this mandatory 
challenger who nobody knows go fuck that

268
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:36,270
fight.
I'm going to go fight Canelo Alvarez,

269
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:38,670
I'm going to fight this guy or that guy.
And then he gets stripped.

270
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,220
Like because there's like five different
sanctioning bodies.

271
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:46,221
Like boxing is way more of a mess.
So there's like pros and cons to doing 

272
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:50,811
it the way the UFC does it.
But from my point of view of someone 

273
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:51,230
like you,
it's probably much more frustrated.

274
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:51,870
I don't

275
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,100
know what to expect.
Like you get curve

276
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,620
balls all the time in the UFC.
Don't know what to expect,

277
00:11:56,621 --> 00:12:01,621
you know,
like a lot of people were so pissed off 

278
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:01,621
at me for,
for the Holly Holm,

279
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,540
not having the rematch right away.
But it's like,

280
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,380
it's not,
it's not my choice,

281
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:10,381
you know,
they have over you because they think 

282
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:13,081
that I like turned it down or I should 
have went in there like guns a blazing 

283
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:14,170
for holly and like put myself out on my 
shield.

284
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:14,680
Like,
no,

285
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:16,780
we have to have the holly rematch.
You guys,

286
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,170
you don't understand.
But um,

287
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,040
you know,
they call me up.

288
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,430
I'm like,
Amanda,

289
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,810
July ninth.
I'm like,

290
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:26,640
okay,
fuck.

291
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,120
Do you say no?
No you don't.

292
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,360
You can't say no.
So they come up with you like I'm in.

293
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,770
Yeah.
And now you know,

294
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,400
it's like,
dude,

295
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:38,401
relax.
Most people don't get immediate 

296
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:40,051
rematches in their career.
Like unless you are conor mcgregor or 

297
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,050
Rhonda or you know,
someone that's really got a presence,

298
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,460
you don't get an immediate rematch.

299
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,740
Like I didn't when I went back and 
strikeforce when,

300
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,280
when I lost to Ronda,
I didn't get into media.

301
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:47,950
I've never gotten immediate rematch.
My career.

302
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:50,380
I would have loved to immediately 
rematch cat when I lost to her.

303
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:55,381
But you don't get it.
Sometimes you got to work your way back 

304
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:55,381
up and you know,
hope for the best.

305
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:56,950
But we will,
I'm sure it will fight each other again.

306
00:12:56,951 --> 00:13:01,150
She's fighting a Valentino Oshun Shanko 
now you're going to be in Chicago,

307
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:02,980
right?
It's going to be on the rumble.

308
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:06,070
Johnson Glover to sharer card,
which yeah,

309
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,900
that's going to be crazy.
It is.

310
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,810
And they're both South Pas and Stryker's
is going to be interesting.

311
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,070
Tough shit too.
Dog.

312
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,730
So interesting.
She's very like physically strong.

313
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,860
Like the way she fights.
She's very physical.

314
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,750
I think.
I feel like they are kind of both.

315
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,510
I was just watching her fight with 
Amanda again.

316
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,750
I think I only got through like the 
route and a half before I had to go 

317
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,000
because I was doing the Fox Fox show the
other day and we weren't,

318
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,160
we announced the fight with holly.
That's why I was watching.

319
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,180
She shouldn't Genco and um,
she seems like a counter striker too 

320
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,660
though.
I was wondering when you get to people 

321
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:42,660
who are counter strikers but elite 
strikers,

322
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:42,760
what happens?
Well,

323
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:47,790
holly is much more of a kicker and holly
also is like much more fleet of foot so 

324
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:51,250
it's going to be interesting.
But holly's not weak either.

325
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,290
She's very physically strong,
super strong,

326
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,510
it's going to be an interesting and 
that's a really good fight.

327
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,940
And for shift Chenko it's super 
important.

328
00:13:57,941 --> 00:13:59,740
You know,
she's had a couple pretty good fights in

329
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:03,450
the UFC,
but like this is the big one is like the

330
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,990
map.
Is it headlining?

331
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,580
Yeah.
So it'd be a big one.

332
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,330
Is that the main event?
So I think that's the same card as 

333
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:12,520
rumble.
Johnson and clover.

334
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,950
I can't imagine that.
That wouldn't be the main event,

335
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:18,540
but I don't know.
It might be on Fox Fox one.

336
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,860
That's going to be a big job.
It's a,

337
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,320
it's an awesome card period that 
Chicago.

338
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,130
Chicago's awesome.
I love Chicago.

339
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,830
Oh my God.
My favorite cities in the world.

340
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:30,160
Have you ever had molly's cupcakes?
You're going to say molly,

341
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,090
are you really into the cupcakes?
Like you have this nickname cupcake.

342
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:35,920
Is that real?
What's weird?

343
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:40,921
So recently,
probably the last month I've been 

344
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,520
working with a new sports doctor Dr 
Edwards and he's changing my diet,

345
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:47,521
which is great.
So I've been eating more of a high fat 

346
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:49,471
diet,
Ketogenic Diet and I've been staying 

347
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,310
away from a lot of sugars and stuff and 
I feel really good.

348
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,860
So I haven't been mowing down the 
cupcakes recently.

349
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,380
But um,
in the past I've been known to put down,

350
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,130
you know,
a couple

351
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,690
in the moment you said Ketogenic,
there's thousands of people listening to

352
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:02,580
this podcast.
And like,

353
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:07,590
no,
not again because it comes up so often 

354
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,800
because I've been doing it for five 
months.

355
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:10,820
I've been eating nothing but that,
that's how we eat,

356
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,300
right.
It's lost like 10 pounds.

357
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:13,660
Yeah.

358
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,730
Brian's lost so much weight on this 
diet.

359
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:20,731
Like his camp before,
that was a struggle to get the weight 

360
00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:22,420
down because it's really big for 1:35,
he gets up to like one 65,

361
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,310
you know,
he can get up to one 70 ish.

362
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,850
Yeah.
Remember when he was making the cut the 

363
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:29,850
first time?
Yeah.

364
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,220
It was hot.
Hard and.

365
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,900
But this one you switched to that,
you know,

366
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,920
with a little bit of carbs.
Obviously if you're an athlete you have 

367
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:36,920
to have some carbs.
Sure.

368
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,420
Do.
Strictly fats and what not,

369
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:39,490
but anyways,
weight has flown off.

370
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:41,620
He's way ahead of schedule.
He's doing really good.

371
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:46,621
So we're pumped about that and I mean 
shitloads of fats to and staying lean 

372
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:48,010
and healthy and I feel good.

373
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,970
So like,
do you do what,

374
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,800
what protocol you're following?
Like is it's like 60 percent fat,

375
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,710
30 percent protein,
10 percent carbs.

376
00:15:57,711 --> 00:15:58,190
Like do you need.

377
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,340
No,
I'm not that scientific about it.

378
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:03,280
I kind of just listen to my body and I 
just eat what I feel.

379
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:08,310
I feel like I've been doing it so long 
that I just kind of have a natural 

380
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,551
sense.
It's like if I'm hungry then I just 

381
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,831
choose to eat something that's more fat 
based than something that's the sugary 

382
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:17,110
or our carby like what kind of foods are
you gravitating towards?

383
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,190
So recently I've been so stoked about 
liver Mousse,

384
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,760
liver Mousse,
like yeah,

385
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:25,820
yeah,
they're delicious.

386
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:27,910
So if you go to whole foods and you are 
the cheese section,

387
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:32,911
they have these little packages of Moose
liver and they have different flavors 

388
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:37,381
and I got like a truffled one.
I think I ate almost the whole thing in 

389
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:38,020
one sitting,
but they're not that big.

390
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:38,830
I mean they're like,
you know,

391
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,680
but I mean it's kind of a lot of fat in 
the liver is really,

392
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:46,681
really good for you.
It's got like vitamin D and tons of 

393
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:48,991
vitamin C I guess more than carrots.
Like liver has crazy amounts of vitamin 

394
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:50,080
C,
so it's like a super food.

395
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,190
And my doctor told me,
I'm like,

396
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:51,790
oh,
whatever.

397
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,940
I tend to like foods more when I know 
they're good for me to something like 

398
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,460
mentally in my brain just tells me this 
is good for you.

399
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,880
You'd like it really

400
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,220
well,
I guess if you train as much as you do,

401
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,960
that does totally make sense.
Yeah.

402
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,610
And beets,
beets,

403
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,790
beets are grade for it.
Yeah.

404
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,100
Beet juice.
Oh yeah.

405
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:08,590
That sounds fantastic for your beet 
juice.

406
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:10,220
Also,
it mimics things like,

407
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:13,880
um,
the endurance properties of things like,

408
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:18,881
um,
a certain mushrooms if you take beats 

409
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:21,620
like rick or rich roll,
who is a endurance athlete,

410
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:22,570
was saying that,
uh,

411
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:27,571
he found like significant advantages in 
taking beet juice and that like blending

412
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:32,981
beats and like a Kale shake or something
along those lines really gave him like 

413
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:33,140
an extra boost in training.

414
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:38,590
Yeah.
This is a little company called love 

415
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:38,590
beets.
I don't know if they're little.

416
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:38,840
They could be big love beets.
You see a lot of,

417
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,290
a lot of them.
I'm at the whole foods too.

418
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,870
They have like the canopies and um,
how was doing UFC embedded in.

419
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:47,180
I had beats on my salad and then they 
reached out to me like,

420
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,210
oh,
we saw she had beats on her salad.

421
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,510
We want to send her out some beet juice.
Like maybe it was,

422
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,900
maybe it was,
maybe she was having libido actually was

423
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,280
love beets.
And they sent me out this.

424
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,110
Oh man,
this shit is delicious.

425
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,380
It's so good.
And they're the one that's um,

426
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,070
beats and ginger.
They've that,

427
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,860
oh my God,
it's to die for.

428
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,950
I love it.
Anytime you can get like powerful 

429
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,290
natural nutrients like and they come in 
last two gen kind of like,

430
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,580
I kinda got on that,
that glass drinking out of glass instead

431
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:18,090
of plastic.

432
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,470
I kind of got on that train a little 
bit.

433
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:21,630
I don't know if you're around that yet.
It's definitely smart.

434
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,010
I mean plastic for sure can leach some 
chemical taste it sometimes in the water

435
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:31,011
and I'm like if I feel like if I can 
taste it and our body's made up so much 

436
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:34,041
of water anyways,
so I think with a better water you put 

437
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:34,041
in your body,
it makes more sense.

438
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:34,041
Right?
For sure.

439
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,080
Well the real issue I think is when 
people leave bottles of water,

440
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:39,540
plastic bottles in their car and they 
heat up,

441
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,850
we'll think about how they get 
transported.

442
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,340
It's not like they're in a cooler.
Very good point,

443
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:45,330
you know?
I mean,

444
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:46,080
you drink,
I'm cold.

445
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,110
If it's cold,
you don't taste the plastic as much so 

446
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,110
you,
they sell it to you cold,

447
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,330
he put it in the fridge and you drink 
your water bottle.

448
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,660
And you don't really taste it as much,
but if you let it get to room 

449
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:56,660
temperature,
just buying it from the story,

450
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,561
probably you'll taste the plastic.
I wonder if anybody's ever done any 

451
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:01,170
studies where they've taken to arrowhead
water,

452
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,220
Fiji water from the shelf and just test 
it and see how much.

453
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,070
Yeah,
that shit is in the actual water itself.

454
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,390
Yeah.
I wonder too,

455
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,190
but I just.
The fact that I can taste it sometimes,

456
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,560
like I think I'll go with glass like 
more natural.

457
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,580
It's better for you,
right?

458
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,320
For sure.
So do you eat?

459
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,080
Do you eat a lot of Avocados?
Mct Oil,

460
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:24,130
coq 100 percent mct oils I put,
I've been digging this or you a tumeric 

461
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,950
and curcumin.
Curcumin,

462
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,130
the Dr Rhonda Patrick Show.
Oh my gosh,

463
00:19:30,131 --> 00:19:35,131
you blew my mind.
I've listened that episode like five 

464
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:37,551
times and I still have to go back over 
the fine tooth comb and write notes.

465
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,280
I just downloaded the second ones.
I've listened to the first one like five

466
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,560
times.
So I figured I think I got enough of the

467
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,370
information.
Finally.

468
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:48,060
She's so freaking smart.
And then now I downloaded the one before

469
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,500
the last one,
so I'm about to listen to that one.

470
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,120
Probably on the flight home.
She spooky.

471
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:52,060
Smart.
Yeah.

472
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:55,860
So she was talking about all that and my
sports doctors is in complete agreement.

473
00:19:55,861 --> 00:20:00,861
So anyways,
I don't know where I was going with 

474
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:00,861
that.
What did you ask about eating?

475
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:01,260
Oh,
coconut oil,

476
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,650
um,
curcumin or turmeric and ginger.

477
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:08,910
I make like a tea in the morning and I 
that I like blended up.

478
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:13,911
So it's frothy and delicious.
Speaking of not eating a lot of sugar 

479
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:13,911
though.
We did.

480
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:18,471
Um,
I did use on a UFC tonight last night 

481
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:22,251
and then we did tough talks and the kid 
Kahleel we had a cupcake eating contest.

482
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,660
Oh No.
Oh my God.

483
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,070
I was wrecked for the rest of last night
because I haven't been eating sugar mad,

484
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:34,570
you know,
I'm competitive so I'm just going down 

485
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:34,570
these cupcakes.

486
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:40,310
So they,
they gave me like smaller ones for the 

487
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,310
weight class discrepancy.
So yeah,

488
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,790
like,
I know,

489
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,160
but you know what actually it was kind 
of a disadvantage that appeal more of 

490
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,910
them spend time trying to peel them out.
So I,

491
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,040
I,
I,

492
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,620
I think I ate four and then my sofic is 
to shut and it was like,

493
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,690
Eh,
like no more swelling,

494
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,710
another bite.
So I shoved three more in my mouth and 

495
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,761
just like held them in the last sense 
because I was like shoving them in my 

496
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:02,860
mouth.
So I think it was seven,

497
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,850
but I spit three of them out.
No.

498
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,650
When you say your soft biggest shock,
was it like you couldn't swap,

499
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,700
did you have milk?
I did have milk but there was just too 

500
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,381
much.
There wasn't room for milk in my mouth 

501
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:16,381
anymore.
It was just all cupcake.

502
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:18,760
It was like,
it was hilarious.

503
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,070
The videos on my facebook page if you're
interested in watching,

504
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:26,071
it was pretty disgusting actually.
What did you feel like after it was 

505
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:26,071
over?
I felt terrible,

506
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:27,100
honestly.
Like I was like shaking.

507
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:28,390
I was like,
oh.

508
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:31,110
It was like,
I feel like I kind of had a gut ache was

509
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:31,710
like this is a really good,

510
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,720
bad idea.
Isn't that weird that you could have 

511
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:36,720
eaten those things like a year ago?
No problem.

512
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,450
And then I just now for many cupcakes 
and I'm feeling like garbage.

513
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,950
I was on the Diet for a long time and 
then I had a cheeseburger and a malt.

514
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,040
I got a big ass chocolate malt and I 
was.

515
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,560
It was a huge.
It was like that big.

516
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,110
It was all sugar gets you.
I was wrecked.

517
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,100
I laid down on the couch.
It is when you just get used to it.

518
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,630
That's the problem.
And when you're used to it,

519
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:00,050
your body's seems like,
ah,

520
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:01,420
this is nothing.
So when people,

521
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,050
oh,
here you are,

522
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
who you are eating a cupcake.

523
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,250
My mouth is watch and I'm throwing.
They're counting down.

524
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,180
I'm like,
Oh God.

525
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,670
It's so gross.
Disgusting.

526
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,740
It's terrible.
Like the referee outfit on.

527
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,830
I couldn't.
I have three cupcakes in my mouth.

528
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,950
I know my lips are literally bursting.
Like,

529
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,440
see if this was fear factor we would 
have made you swallow it and open your 

530
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:27,440
mouth.
That's the only way accounts would have.

531
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,370
Speaking of fear factor,
I always wanted to do that show.

532
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:31,320
I used to watch it all the time to talk 
to you out of it.

533
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,950
I could eat that disgusting stuff.
You think you could.

534
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,030
I think I could.
Well,

535
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,310
you could probably eat some of it.
I eat some of it.

536
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Really as I asked you,
what was the most disgusting thing that 

537
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,300
they made some money.
You think blended stuff is the worst,

538
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,830
like blended bugs and stuff.
When did pancreas and different.

539
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:54,831
Disgusting like blended the spleens and 
there was some and you know what's 

540
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:59,331
really interesting is one of the ways we
made things more disgusting was 

541
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:00,300
expensive cheese.
Like if you go to,

542
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,000
what's it called?
A formal ga for Azure.

543
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,670
Cheesy story,
but go ahead and tell me.

544
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,920
They will go to the Beverly Hills store 
that sells like super expensive,

545
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,330
like Primo French cheese and it smells 
like donkey Dick.

546
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,210
It's so bad.
You open up the top of it and you go,

547
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:20,640
what in the fuck is wrong with French 
people?

548
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:27,650
That's my.
That's my disgusting stinky cheese 

549
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,681
story.
It was in France the first time I went 

550
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,571
to Paris.
It was over Valentine's Day and Brian 

551
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,470
and I were on this really beautiful 
dinner boat thing and you know,

552
00:23:33,471 --> 00:23:36,020
they bring out all this food and we're 
getting for grandma and like whatever,

553
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,500
and they bring out cheese.
I'm a cheese lover.

554
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,680
I love cheese.
I could never give up cheese.

555
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:45,050
It's the one that I would,
I would venture to say,

556
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,040
you know,
well especially now for

557
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,370
sure I'd picked cheese over cupcakes if 
I had to cut something out of my diet by

558
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,570
buy cupcakes.
Like I'm eating,

559
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,510
I'm sticking with the cheese anyways.
They bring this cheese on,

560
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:55,790
there's three of them.
One is fine.

561
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,710
The other ones like it's a little 
stinky,

562
00:23:57,711 --> 00:24:02,711
but I think I'll try.
The other one smelled like a rotting 

563
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:03,500
carcass.
I kid you not,

564
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,960
I believe you.
It smelled like someone ran over 

565
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,160
roadkill and then they like.
Then they served it up like two weeks 

566
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,740
later after it had been like an 
extremely soft.

567
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,090
People eat.
I'm like,

568
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:18,540
what's wrong?
I was like getting away.

569
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:23,550
I wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole was
in beverly hills where we used to send 

570
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,971
the people that worked for fear factor 
to buy it and they would walk by this 

571
00:24:27,971 --> 00:24:30,200
place and they open the door and you'd 
be like,

572
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,160
what in the fuck?

573
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,840
And meanwhile people are paying a lot of
money for this thing that if it smelled 

574
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,370
anything like that,
small,

575
00:24:38,371 --> 00:24:41,360
like I might've struggled to eat it.
I've been with the same stuff.

576
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,860
I mean I don't know what it was called.
I would have to call my friend,

577
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,040
just plugged my notes.
I like to think I'd be able to eat 

578
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,040
anything.
Is it?

579
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,580
I Dunno.
Well you're pretty mentally tough.

580
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,290
That's the thing.
I could get through it and was over.

581
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,600
You probably blank out of your mind that
deals with that and just go into the 

582
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,640
zone,
throw it in and then you're like,

583
00:24:58,641 --> 00:24:59,300
am I good?
Yeah.

584
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:03,380
Then he'd run over to the garbage pail.
That's what happened.

585
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:08,650
I saw more people throw up and probably 
I would say like if you like look at me 

586
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,660
and like maybe catch cafeteria lunch 
ladies.

587
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,450
We've probably seen the most people 
throw up in the world.

588
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,240
Oh,
I bet.

589
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:20,490
I've seen.
I saw how fucking people throw up every 

590
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:20,490
week.
I saw people throw it.

591
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,000
I became completely immune to throw up.
You I think would be more gross than the

592
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:28,060
blended stuff.
I feel like as long as there was enough 

593
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,060
liquid to be able to just swallow it,
I think I get through it,

594
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,280
but I think it would be hard for me as 
the like crunchy bugs,

595
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,310
dirt easy really well for me because 
just like anything.

596
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,600
Yeah,
but it's not the taste,

597
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,700
the texture,
the sound,

598
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:43,390
the sound of it.
Like the shell crunching and then like 

599
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:43,390
the guts exploding.
I don't know.

600
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,390
We were just talking like this is 
disgusting topic,

601
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:46,610
but that's like my.
That's like that.

602
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,470
Or the big old caterpillar's like where 
they pop in your mouth.

603
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,550
Like hearing something like that I think
is what would get me to eat a tomato 

604
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:54,550
horn worm.

605
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,490
That wasn't the best tasting thing in 
the world.

606
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,950
That one popped in my mind.
Those things.

607
00:25:57,951 --> 00:25:59,180
I think that would be a little hard for 
me,

608
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,950
but it's nothing like that.
Gum,

609
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,200
remember that gum used to have the 
squirt center.

610
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,170
It's good for your breath.
You remember that stuff?

611
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,880
Yes.
They still have that stuff.

612
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,570
I'm sure they do.
That gum is like tomato horn worm.

613
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,380
You pop it except it doesn't taste good 
when squirts.

614
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,860
Tastes like,
but it does.

615
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:17,720
It's like neutral.
That would be a struggle for me.

616
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:18,970
That's just my thing.
I don't know.

617
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:24,250
That's my thing is like anticipating the
pop or the crunch telling you you would 

618
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,570
just do it.
I'm telling you nothing.

619
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,880
The bugs or nothing.
I was in Mexico recently and they were 

620
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:31,880
served crickets.
The crickets.

621
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,731
So like,
like it was a snack that they left in a 

622
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:36,731
hotel like fried crickets.

623
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:41,290
I don't know.
I guess if I could do it at my own pace 

624
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,511
and I like they were cooked crickets.
I'd probably try one own peers and 

625
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,050
staff.
The thing is,

626
00:26:45,051 --> 00:26:50,051
what would be the thing that you only 
have a certain time or one where they 

627
00:26:50,051 --> 00:26:51,300
stuck with those spiders with like super
long,

628
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:56,301
long legs and it was like trying to 
crawl out of the person's mouth while 

629
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:56,430
they were eating it and like that was 
just like,

630
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,520
oh my God,
that would be a African cave dwelling 

631
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,730
spider.
I ain't one of those two really.

632
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,340
I eat a lot of shit.
He's alive.

633
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,230
He always threw it in there.
Chewed up.

634
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,890
Can I bite you?
They tried really felt like a little 

635
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,910
pinch her on my lip but serious.
But I am death.

636
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,260
You just mounted down and I'm like,
I got down on those cupcakes.

637
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,120
You imagine being a force,
bartered some fucking gag for a TV show 

638
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,120
and someone's going to eat,
you know.

639
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,990
But um,
yeah.

640
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:32,110
The most bugs don't taste like anything.
I bet the ones that are really bad or 

641
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,640
poisonous,
they probably would fuck with you.

642
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:34,800
Like if you had a black widow probably 
tastes like shit.

643
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,800
Nobody ever had like a live snake or 
anything like that?

644
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,640
No.
No.

645
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,880
Well we can't give any of the animals.
We had,

646
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,400
we did,
we did do some stuff with snakes.

647
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:49,550
It was really interesting what people 
would get upset about and what people 

648
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:49,650
wouldn't get upset about like p,
the Peta would,

649
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,770
they would get really upset if we did 
things with rats or things with rodents.

650
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,170
Particularly problematic,
but people didn't get upset about things

651
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:03,171
with bugs.
Like there's a really clear hierarchy 

652
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:05,781
that people have with life and people 
just don't seem to get that upset about 

653
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:10,430
bugs,
but like certain animals take almost 

654
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:10,430
feel bad.

655
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,880
If I was to eat a live bug,
part of me would feel bad.

656
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,300
I don't know.
What about lobster and throw lobster and

657
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:17,040
a pot.
I feel bad about that too.

658
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:22,130
Oh yeah.
I prefer to just kill it real quick 

659
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,130
first and then I'm fine with it.
Yeah,

660
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,320
I think they're meant to be eaten.
I'm fine.

661
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:24,780
Like with Hyundai doesn't bother me,
but the,

662
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,350
the idea of them may be experiencing 
extrusion,

663
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:33,351
eat amount of pain before,
like just just like seven in the head 

664
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:33,630
real quick and then it's done.
It's dead.

665
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:35,340
You killed it humanely and then eat it.
No problem.

666
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,880
Care about that.
But they say the lobsters can't feel 

667
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,000
pain,
but I say bullshit bullshit too.

668
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,930
How do you know you're not a lobster?
Have you ever been lot?

669
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,110
No.

670
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,070
So I just say err on the side of 
caution.

671
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,080
Just kill it.
First used to go crabbing up in the San 

672
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,200
Juan Islands.
We'd catch fresh dungeness crabs.

673
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,380
Cook it within like an hour that they 
taste so much better that way.

674
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:02,320
It's incredible isn't.
Yeah.

675
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,280
Brian can't eat seafood to save his life
at all.

676
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,170
Like he can't,
cannot stomach it.

677
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,760
Like you can't eat anything out of the 
water.

678
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,750
Anything.
Even like seaweed,

679
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,740
anything psychological?
Sure.

680
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,150
I think part of it's psychology.
He just doesn't like it at all.

681
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,730
He thinks it tastes disgusting.
Like the taste of the ocean.

682
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:23,830
Like you get a lot in fish skin or like 
seaweed,

683
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:26,880
like anything that tastes resembles the 
flavor of the ocean.

684
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:28,050
Something watery.
He hates it.

685
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:33,170
Is He from Washington state too?
So it was it like an overdose of fish 

686
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,260
because everybody's up there eating fish
all the time.

687
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,970
No,
because he lived on the.

688
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,040
He lived in central Washington area.
Right on the other side of the 

689
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,941
mountains,
so it's a little more like grainy and 

690
00:29:43,941 --> 00:29:43,941
dry and a little bit farther away from 
the water.

691
00:29:43,941 --> 00:29:45,190
But um,
he ate dungeness crab.

692
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,630
This was going to get back to,
is that,

693
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:49,810
that will have a crab that we caught 
that day and killed it and boiled and we

694
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:51,780
had this sweet butter to debit.
Well,

695
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,420
yeah,
actually.

696
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:53,290
Like he ate it and was like,
yeah,

697
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:58,291
it was pretty good.
Those was the only seafood thing he's 

698
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,301
ever eaten in his life that was swarming
crabs on the seafloor.

699
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,520
Why?
Oh my God.

700
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,010
Is that real?
Thousands and thousands of crabs.

701
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,040
You can even see the floor off the coast
of Panama says,

702
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,200
Holy Shit.
What kind of crabs are these?

703
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,390
Red,
red crabs?

704
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,650
And they just covering the floor like 
sand.

705
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,320
That's insane.
They didn't.

706
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,880
When I think of when I read this,
they said they didn't know what it was.

707
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,880
They thought it was just the moving sand
on the ground until they got to put 

708
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:26,880
light on it.
Then they saw that it was crabs.

709
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,810
Wow.
Are the little tiny crabs,

710
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:33,811
is that what it is?
They look like they'd be pretty big 

711
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,340
crabs are the cleanup crew.
Crabs and lobster.

712
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:39,100
It's interesting how good they taste 
when you consider what they do.

713
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:42,960
They just basically eat rotten things 
that like sharks leave behind other fish

714
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:47,961
leave behind.
And I mean they're just the cleanup 

715
00:30:47,961 --> 00:30:47,961
crew.
Yeah.

716
00:30:47,961 --> 00:30:47,961
Were,
were like,

717
00:30:47,961 --> 00:30:49,730
got to be grass fed beef,
but we can eat,

718
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:54,870
we can eat shit eating now.
That's so crazy that brian doesn't eat 

719
00:30:56,321 --> 00:31:01,321
any seafood because I would imagine that
especially considering that he cuts 

720
00:31:01,321 --> 00:31:03,160
through so much weight,
like that would be like a good source of

721
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:07,840
lean protein fish.
His friends wanted to mess with them one

722
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:10,120
time and he had like,
he's at a restaurant and one of them had

723
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,110
had salmon.

724
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:16,230
Brian's like one of those guys like does
he want to look like if you're eating 

725
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,230
seafood,
does he want it?

726
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,320
He doesn't want to look.
Yeah,

727
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,580
he does.
He just so like so grossed out about it.

728
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,220
And um,
so he got up to go to the bathroom and I

729
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:22,860
guess I wasn't there.
I wasn't dating but this,

730
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:27,861
this was a long time ago,
I guess they picked up a piece of the 

731
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:29,881
salmon and rubbed it all over the rib of
his cup of milk and he smelled it and 

732
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:32,860
then threw it like he went to take a sip
and he almost just see,

733
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:34,480
just like lost it because he's.
Yeah,

734
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:39,481
he smelled it and I don't know.
Did someone like force feed them a fish 

735
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:39,481
when he was a little kid or something?
Oh,

736
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,670
I kinda wonder if something traumatic 
had to have happened.

737
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,150
Bravo's got a weird thing like that.

738
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,250
Onions,
I'd give them onions.

739
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:47,350
He'll fucking freak out.
What if they're cooked?

740
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,030
I don't think he can even eat them 
cooked.

741
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:50,020
Really?
Yeah.

742
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:51,760
Apparently he had a douchebag for 
Stepdad.

743
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:57,010
His stepdad used to make meat.
So Vj and the uneasiness of each day to 

744
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,691
this day,
like just freaking the fuck out of can 

745
00:32:00,691 --> 00:32:00,691
of onions.
Like everything on with that.

746
00:32:00,691 --> 00:32:01,780
Um,
with chocolate flavor things.

747
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,740
What's,
yeah,

748
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,840
what about cupcakes?
No chocolate cupcakes really?

749
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:08,890
Now I don't like,
um,

750
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,570
I don't like chocolate.
I don't like chocolate ice cream I don't

751
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:15,880
like,
but I like milk chocolate,

752
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,150
dark chocolate.
No,

753
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:24,151
I'm okay with this.
As long as it's not anything chocolate 

754
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:24,220
flavor,
it has to be real chocolate.

755
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,480
Just,
it can't be anything.

756
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,540
It's such a weird thing.
But the thing is I was really sick when 

757
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,360
I was a little girl was like five or six
years old.

758
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,500
I had a,
like,

759
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:33,910
I almost died.
I went to the hospital,

760
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,250
I had to get a spinal tap because all my
veins had collapsed.

761
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:37,450
I was so,
yeah,

762
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:38,910
I got really,
really sick.

763
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,010
What was it?
I

764
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,660
had rye,
Rye Syndrome.

765
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,840
I don't know what that is.
I don't remember exactly the details 

766
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,460
about why you liked the bread.
I don't know.

767
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,980
We never really quick.
It's bad.

768
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:53,981
That was killed.
You have chicken pox and then I had a 

769
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:57,520
form of hepatitis hepatitis B.
that's what I had all three at the same 

770
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,261
time because my immune system was down 
from the chicken pox and then I caught 

771
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:03,260
that and then I kinda have to add and 
um,

772
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,580
yeah.
So,

773
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,940
so my parents took me obviously to the 
hospital and they couldn't,

774
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,910
they,
they,

775
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,430
I had a phobia of needles for awhile 
too.

776
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,370
They got an ivy and me barely.
And um,

777
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:18,371
you know,
how like they're supposed to leave the 

778
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,661
ivy and you.
And then they changed the tubing will 

779
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:19,760
the stupid nurse pulled it out and all 
my veins were so collapsed they couldn't

780
00:33:19,761 --> 00:33:21,440
get a needle in anymore.

781
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,140
So they would come in.
I was just passed out.

782
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,320
They would come in on the hour almost 
every hour on the hour and I would wake 

783
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,710
up to like 10 or 15 people holding me 
down.

784
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:32,300
It felt like 10 or 15.
I was five.

785
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,360
It was probably like three people,
but I just see lights and see will 

786
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,111
holding me down and they'd be trying to 
stick needles in the top of my hand in 

787
00:33:40,111 --> 00:33:42,530
my ankles and the tops of my feet behind
my knees like that.

788
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:47,540
And they hold me down trying to get 
fluids in me because I couldn't keep 

789
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,621
anything down.
And so finally it was so bad that they 

790
00:33:50,621 --> 00:33:52,500
told my mom to like call it if she's 
religious,

791
00:33:52,501 --> 00:33:54,410
I call her pastor and like have him 
come.

792
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:55,900
And like they were like,
yeah,

793
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:56,860
like she's gonna,
you know,

794
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,200
so they brought me in to give me a 
spinal tap and my God,

795
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,240
it was the most painful thing I've ever 
experienced in my life because he take 

796
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,300
fluid out and epidurals,
like I hear really painful too,

797
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:08,390
but it's an injection as opposed to like
removing the fluid,

798
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:09,290
which is more painful.

799
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,900
I don't know.
I remember feeling the most excruciating

800
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:15,230
pain in my life and then passing out.
I was so weak anyways.

801
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:15,950
It was pretty terrible.
I,

802
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,740
it was back to the chocolate part of it 
before I went to the hospital,

803
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,120
I was running such a bad fever and I was
throwing up and my mom thought,

804
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,760
you know,
let's give her ice cream.

805
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,410
And she had like some Neapolitan ice 
cream downstairs and she was like,

806
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,240
they're really cheap.
Crap.

807
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,530
We didn't.
I didn't grow up in,

808
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:37,531
you know,
with a lot of money or anything like 

809
00:34:37,531 --> 00:34:37,531
that.
We struggled.

810
00:34:37,531 --> 00:34:37,531
So it was like the cheap fake 
strawberry,

811
00:34:37,531 --> 00:34:41,500
the cheap vanilla in the really shitty 
cheap chocolate and I tried to eat some 

812
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:46,541
of those,
the strawberry and the vanilla and I 

813
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:49,091
fell asleep and I woke up and I was 
really hungry and really thirsty and I 

814
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:53,861
went and the all the chocolate had 
melted so it was like a super bowl of 

815
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:57,281
warm ice cream and I took try to take a 
bite of it because it's just a little 

816
00:34:57,281 --> 00:35:01,121
kid and I lost my shit.
I puked everywhere and to this day it 

817
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:03,290
ruined it for me,
like ruined anything chocolate flavored.

818
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,000
What I can do,
like dark chocolate,

819
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,290
a real chart but has to be quality.

820
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,950
So if somebody brings you like a 
superbowl neapolitan ice cream right now

821
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,180
and it just.
Yeah,

822
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,730
it's.
Yeah,

823
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,670
it is mentally fucked me forever.
Look at the definition,

824
00:35:19,671 --> 00:35:20,780
Jamie.
Pull that back up again.

825
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:22,640
Please.
Look at the definition of rise.

826
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:23,450
Disease.
I mean it's,

827
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,450
look at this,
a rare but serious condition that causes

828
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:29,630
swelling in the liver and the brain 
liver damage perfectly.

829
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,140
They said it was permanent.
I don't know.

830
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:36,430
Most often affects children and 
teenagers recovering from a viral 

831
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:36,890
infection most commonly the flu or 
chicken.

832
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,820
That's amazing.

833
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,380
I've never heard no that.
I never looked at it,

834
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:43,390
but I knew that I had some liver damage.
They actually told me to.

835
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,290
It's been linked to this.
So you have this use caution when giving

836
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,380
aspirin to children and teenagers and 
that's exactly when.

837
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,940
That's.
That's why.

838
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yeah,
that's why that happened because my mom 

839
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,321
told me she called.
She called the hospital and ask them 

840
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:57,940
like,
my daughter has chickenpox,

841
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,060
what should I,
what should I give them,

842
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,900
give her whatever,
and they're like,

843
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,800
oh,
just give her aspirin,

844
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:07,770
you know,
give her some aspirin to help her with 

845
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:07,770
that.
And that's what caused that.

846
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:07,770
And then it was just bad.
It was really,

847
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:12,741
really bad.
It was so weird that it's connected to 

848
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:12,741
aspirin.
I wonder what the fuck.

849
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:12,741
The fact,
I didn't even know that actually,

850
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,900
but I just know that like that I had 
that in,

851
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:15,690
that had liver damage.

852
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:20,690
They actually told me that I would 
probably never be able to excel as an 

853
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:24,110
athlete because of that,
because of your liver damage because of 

854
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,841
the liver and like,
I don't know if maybe that's why I'm 

855
00:36:26,841 --> 00:36:28,941
like,
so maybe just show up and maybe I 

856
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:28,941
shouldn't blame,
blame my,

857
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:29,700
like my,
my lack of,

858
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:30,140
uh,
of,

859
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,790
of paying attention to situations and 
knowledge of things.

860
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:37,791
I can never remember people's names.
Maybe I will say I get punched in the 

861
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:40,191
head for living.
Maybe it was that like brain damage and 

862
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:40,191
liver damage,
all those things can be great.

863
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:44,070
But if anybody said that you would never
make it as an athlete told me like,

864
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:44,540
yeah,
the.

865
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,530
Yeah,
exactly.

866
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,920
Right.
The doctors were like,

867
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:48,410
yeah,
she's probably going to always have an,

868
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:53,430
you know,
an issue as an athlete to like to excel 

869
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,690
now.
Have you ever got like a liver toxology 

870
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:56,690
toxology no examination or something 
like that?

871
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,120
No,
I never had.

872
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,900
It seems like it'd be a good idea to do.
My mom always told me she's like,

873
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:03,810
you should do a visualization of your 
liver healing itself.

874
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:06,480
So you said you had to like envision my 
liver,

875
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:09,000
like growing moms?
Yeah,

876
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:09,660
it was.
Yeah,

877
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,970
she was.
She never totally visually than anything

878
00:37:11,971 --> 00:37:13,680
else,
but I remember that now this is bringing

879
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:14,490
back memories.
She's like,

880
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:15,450
you should try to,
you know,

881
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,510
think about your liver being healthy.
I don't know if it helps.

882
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,610
We use now a lot.

883
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,520
Visualization.
Absolutely beneficial means the mind has

884
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:26,920
also to weird properties that we don't 
totally understand.

885
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,460
That's why placebo effects work.
We don't know why they work,

886
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:35,461
but it does work.
It's statistically proven that if you 

887
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,480
have a positive attitude and you believe
something can help you,

888
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:42,600
it can help you.
But the problem with that is people use 

889
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,090
that as like an excuse for charlatans 
like psychics and palm readers and Tarot

890
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:49,930
card readers and healers.
Healers are a big one.

891
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:55,290
There was a guy that was working with a 
bunch of UFC fighters back in the day 

892
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,740
that people would call like the witch 
doctor and this guy was like doing all 

893
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,550
these things.
Do you remember George St Pierre?

894
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:01,990
Um,
not,

895
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,870
not do remember,
obviously.

896
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:09,070
But do you remember George St Pierre?
They had this thing that these do with 

897
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,060
him when they would like rub his back 
and rub his sternum,

898
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,830
they had never understood that it was 
just shit that this guy had talked these

899
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:16,630
people into doing like a bunch of 
fighters.

900
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,940
Like even fucking randy couture was 
going to this guy.

901
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,760
Yeah,
and the guy turned out to be a total Ho.

902
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,370
I met him and I just felt like right 
away because I'm so used to hoaxers.

903
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:31,380
I'm so used to being around bullshit 
artists and examining them as soon as 

904
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,520
you started talking about the Meridians 
of the body and this and that,

905
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:34,120
and I was like,
Oh,

906
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:36,640
you're full of shit.
You're full of shit.

907
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:38,580
And you got deeper into these people.
You're,

908
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,260
you're rubbing on them and you're 
opening up their chakras.

909
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,000
Old fucking for sure.
You are

910
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,540
people that do the funny like ci videos,
I feel like it's like a cold almost 

911
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,620
sometimes there's people in there like,
you know,

912
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:53,260
I can make someone flip over by just 
doing this or like whatever.

913
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:57,100
They do the weirdest things and the 
people that that they convinced to,

914
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,920
like it takes two to do that obviously 
because it's not real.

915
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,060
So the person doing it and the person 
getting the move or whatever done to you

916
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:09,061
have to have know that person has to 
agree to do it and then it's always so 

917
00:39:09,061 --> 00:39:12,991
funny to me when you see them get 
approached by someone who doesn't 

918
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:13,000
believe in that at all and they're like,
they're like,

919
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,560
okay,
do you have to me like,

920
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,640
okay.
And they really,

921
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,790
they really think that it's gonna work 
and the person's just standing there and

922
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:19,720
I'm like,
no,

923
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:20,380
it's not working.
They're like,

924
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,280
it's not working.

925
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:25,570
Oh you know it's going to work.
They think is going to work,

926
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:30,690
but given the bullshit artists thinks 
it's going to work or you ever see the 

927
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,470
guy that was like trying to chop a shop 
was,

928
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:38,260
I'm not a pint of almost a pineapple,
but a coconut try to shop,

929
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,540
but like his hand,
he was trying to set a world record.

930
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,080
You guys should pull that video up.
It's what his hand was.

931
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,460
It bare hand.
He's like a karate guy.

932
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,960
He'll be like,
chopped the boards.

933
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,750
I think it might have to break a coconut
with your hand.

934
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,800
No,
and it was funny because he had like a 

935
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:56,800
news crew there and he had like 20 
coconut set out on like this,

936
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,240
this bar,
and he starts just hacking at one 

937
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,240
hacking at one hack.
Anyone?

938
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,950
Yes.
And,

939
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,940
and it's like,
well you watch the video.

940
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,030
It's hilarious.
I'm going to have.

941
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,880
I'm like,
guy think that this would work.

942
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,410
He's one of these guys.
I'm telling you.

943
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,230
You got a karate outfit on and look at 
it as a metal bar underneath that.

944
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:13,560
So watch when he misses.
Oh No,

945
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,320
no,
no.

946
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:15,820
He misses,
but yeah.

947
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,970
Oh,
fail.

948
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,180
He does this.
Oh my God.

949
00:40:21,181 --> 00:40:22,950
He hits the fucking.
Oh,

950
00:40:22,951 --> 00:40:24,230
fail.
Fail.

951
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,110
Oh my God.
He hits them

952
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,950
like his hands hurting.
Yeah,

953
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,840
for sure.
He had to pull away that he doesn't want

954
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:30,860
to do it again.
He doesn't want to,

955
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:31,730
but he's like,
I got to.

956
00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:32,510
And he's like,
okay.

957
00:40:32,511 --> 00:40:33,380
No,
she stepped in.

958
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:33,770
Thank God.

959
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,890
Why was he thinking that that would 
work?

960
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,140
Wouldn't you practice that before you 
got on television,

961
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,920
but you imagine thinking that you would 
karate chop a fucking coconut open.

962
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,980
How about just hit the earth in and wake
up people in China?

963
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,630
That's what I was saying.
No.

964
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:54,710
So yes,
the mind is a very powerful thing where 

965
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,860
there's a gang of videos of these guys 
that are doing those key things on 

966
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,181
people and then their students fall to 
the ground and start twitching and 

967
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:03,290
there's a great one with this guy in 
Harlem had this,

968
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:06,230
uh,
like Kung Fu school and he had all these

969
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:11,231
students and he,
he's like doing all this like literally 

970
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:15,390
like Dragon Ball z type shit on them.
Like they would have followed the ground

971
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:18,170
and start twitching and spasming and 
it's like really shitty acting.

972
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,610
But they are into it.
I think when you're in a cult like that.

973
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,150
And that's what a lot of those martial 
arts are.

974
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:29,220
There are a cult and I think almost all 
traditional martial arts have like 

975
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,181
attributes which can be beneficial,
like the discipline and desire to please

976
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:39,671
your Sensei or your,
your Sabam name or whatever you wanna 

977
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:40,600
call them is like it's intense and you 
know,

978
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,800
yes sir,
and they bow and all this stuff and they

979
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:45,380
really believed that their instructor 
cannot do any harm.

980
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:50,590
There's a lot of good in that because it
makes you have this really intense 

981
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:54,350
desire to succeed and this intense 
belief in yourself,

982
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,380
but it's not realistic obviously and a 
lot of traditional martial arts and 

983
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,610
until the UFC came around,
we didn't really know how unrealistic it

984
00:42:01,611 --> 00:42:02,390
was.
Yeah.

985
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:07,670
Well if you remember like Pat Smith when
he fought that Ninja guy and like UFC 

986
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,410
one or two.
I think it was UFC too.

987
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:14,740
I don't remember which one it was,
but he fought some guy and this guy was 

988
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,370
doing these like in the.
You remember they used to have the video

989
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:21,371
of the guy training before the fight and
the guy was like throwing all these 

990
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:23,390
techniques around a flip and people on 
the ground grabbing her neck and fucking

991
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,420
karate chop at the top of their head and
they fall to the ground and the UFC has 

992
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,380
come along way in a short amount of 
time.

993
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,440
Right?
I mean think about like football from 93

994
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,800
and then football in 2016 and kind of 
looks like football.

995
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,220
Still the same,
but the UFC in 93,

996
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:40,970
like,
look at it,

997
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:45,050
it's like it's chaos,
but Pat Smith was like a real fighter.

998
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,970
This is the guy.
Look at it.

999
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,700
I just kept charging that Pat Smith and 
tried to.

1000
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,300
I don't know why I clinched up his name 
and math got on top of him and he just 

1001
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,060
dropped elbows on them and smash this 
poor dudes head open.

1002
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,480
It was awful,
but that's 12 to six years.

1003
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,400
We're still allowed.
Then 12 slash six is the dumbest fucking

1004
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:05,070
rule.
Oh,

1005
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:10,420
here's this guy.
Look at this and this is the best part 

1006
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:10,420
about it.
Pat Smith walks off and the fight is not

1007
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,221
done because he's a kind man for walking
off because the referee is saying the 

1008
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:17,300
fight still going on because.
Yeah,

1009
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,120
yeah,
because it's park.

1010
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,930
Yeah.
That guy got smashed,

1011
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,150
but what's this guy's name again?
Oh No.

1012
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,220
We don't even need to bring up this poor
guy's name,

1013
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,470
but he probably thought it was big John 
Mccarthy.

1014
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:31,280
All lean and healthy looking.
He probably thought that it was real.

1015
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,550
He probably thought that what he,
what he was doing was real and he didn't

1016
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:39,551
know until he got in there with a guy 
like Pat Smith that what he was doing 

1017
00:43:39,551 --> 00:43:42,110
was just some malarkey.
So Mall Strip mall malarkey.

1018
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,470
There's a lot of that out there still to
this day.

1019
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:50,471
It's amazing.
It's kind of makes you wonder sometimes 

1020
00:43:50,471 --> 00:43:50,471
as the world that we live in,
it's like,

1021
00:43:50,471 --> 00:43:51,470
well,
it's that same.

1022
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:56,730
It's the mind,
like the belief in what you can do when 

1023
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,370
you can't do it can benefit you,
but it can also fuck you up.

1024
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,860
Like he can benefit you if you're 
talking about your own health,

1025
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,240
like if you really believe that 
something's healing you,

1026
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:06,350
it can heal you,
but there's like physical limitations,

1027
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:11,650
you know,
like if you believe that Melvin manhoef 

1028
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:11,650
can kick you in the liver and nothing's 
going to happen,

1029
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,590
guess what?
That's not true.

1030
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:16,920
You can chop cooking.
Oh,

1031
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,550
that guy.
There's so many of those people though.

1032
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:24,551
So that was weird.
First podcast I ever listened to of 

1033
00:44:24,551 --> 00:44:25,210
yours was a guy talking about a cult 
that he had been involved in.

1034
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,170
I can't remember his name either,
but it was like,

1035
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,810
it was really fascinating.
He's talked about his story and how they

1036
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:32,430
basically took him in and you remember.
Oh yeah,

1037
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:33,390
Steve Hassan.
Yeah,

1038
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:35,000
he's actually a,
um,

1039
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,020
a cult.
Is that how you say his last name?

1040
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,000
H S h a s s n

1041
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,790
and fascinating man.
He's actually a really warped as mine.

1042
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:46,791
Like that.
He really got into believing that his 

1043
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:46,791
family was against him and like now that
he's removed from it,

1044
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:47,530
he's like,
I was totally

1045
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,540
my mind manipulated.
Yeah.

1046
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:51,670
He's in the moon and he was in the 
moonies that's where,

1047
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,540
that's what he joined up with.
Yeah.

1048
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,090
Yeah.
That's A.

1049
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:59,740
It's a weird store because that guy now 
works to help people get out of cults.

1050
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,420
Well,
he should go help some of these c's 

1051
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:05,420
height.

1052
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,090
Gee People.
I know you've,

1053
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,300
I'm sure you've seen the one with the 
old Asian man who fights the young 

1054
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,720
karate guy.
Have you ever seen that one?

1055
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,450
This guy,
they show him with his students and he's

1056
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:20,451
doing all this stuff and they go flying 
across the room and their body twitches 

1057
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:25,160
and he decides to have an actual no 
rules fight with his young Turkish guy 

1058
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,800
and this guy just fucks him up,
grabbed his shirt and beats his face in 

1059
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:32,700
and high kicks.
Um,

1060
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:36,570
and it's so brutal because the man looks
like he's like in his late sixties.

1061
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:40,230
Yeah.
It looks pretty old and not stout.

1062
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,220
And it's not like,
you know,

1063
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,630
a healthy old 60 either.
He looks like he's got a little potbelly

1064
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,610
and this dude just beat the piss out of 
him.

1065
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,960
And a got like a beating like that from 
a young strong guy who's much bigger 

1066
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,450
than him to the guy looked like much 
stronger than him.

1067
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:57,000
Like that's not something that old guy 
is going to recover from.

1068
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,970
A key might be fucked forever from this.
That's terrible.

1069
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:05,080
In his mind,
he thought that he was going to fucking 

1070
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,080
Kung Fu this dude.

1071
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,650
Do you believe it?
Like have you ever researched much about

1072
00:46:06,651 --> 00:46:09,200
hypnosis and how I've been hypnotized?
Yeah,

1073
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:09,890
yeah,
yeah.

1074
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:10,780
Vinny shoreman and it.

1075
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,050
Well Vinny shoreman.
I don't know if you know who he is.

1076
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:17,130
He works with a lot of fighters.
He worked with Joe Schilling.

1077
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:22,131
He's worked with a lot of MMA fighters 
and he does what he calls himself a mind

1078
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:28,221
trainer.
And what he does is he can talk to you 

1079
00:46:28,221 --> 00:46:30,360
and put you in a state of mind.
It's a very weird thing,

1080
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:35,210
like it's not what people think it is.
It's not like take off your pants and my

1081
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,940
dick gets down like that.
Like you're,

1082
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,160
you're aware kind of.
But it's like an altered state of 

1083
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,060
consciousness.
It's almost like he puts you in like a.

1084
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,870
it's like you're under a drug or 
something.

1085
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:46,960
So.
So I,

1086
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,790
I just recorded a podcast.
I just started my own podcast.

1087
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,440
And what is it?
How do people find it?

1088
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,670
Mutated?
Misha tate.

1089
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,300
Show the fuck out of here.
What'd you come up with that name or.

1090
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,500
No?
Starting to think about that one a lot.

1091
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,050
How about the cupcake?
Our right,

1092
00:46:59,051 --> 00:47:00,350
like I'm getting our.
Yeah.

1093
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,780
Um,
so I,

1094
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:06,870
I sat down with Mark [inaudible] who 
does a comedy hypnosis show 10 years on 

1095
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:11,381
the Strip and absolutely fascinating 
when you think about the conscious mind 

1096
00:47:11,381 --> 00:47:15,401
and the subconscious mind and how the 
conscious mind really is kind of the 

1097
00:47:15,401 --> 00:47:15,401
tip,
just the tip of the iceberg,

1098
00:47:15,401 --> 00:47:20,261
but there's so much more beneath it and 
your subconscious mind is we're talking 

1099
00:47:20,261 --> 00:47:23,201
about how the power of mind and he says,
you kind of go in and out of hypnosis 

1100
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:27,191
states all the time.
Like when you're driving and you start 

1101
00:47:27,191 --> 00:47:27,191
daydreaming or you're,
you know,

1102
00:47:27,191 --> 00:47:27,460
you're sitting,
you just kind of space out.

1103
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,500
You're not really looking at whatever 
you're looking at anymore.

1104
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:32,320
You're in,
you're in a daydream or at night,

1105
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:37,321
you know,
that's kind of a state of an awake 

1106
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:37,630
hypnosis and that you can kind of go in 
and out of those yourself you do all the

1107
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:42,631
time during the day,
but a hypnotists can kind of guide you 

1108
00:47:42,631 --> 00:47:44,290
into that and then plant certain good 
seeds,

1109
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,330
you know,
I guess are bad seeds if they wanted to,

1110
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,590
you know.
But I always thought of that too,

1111
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:52,591
like a Kooky guy that was going to make 
you do dumb shit while you don't know 

1112
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:56,190
what you're doing.
But that was fascinating to me because 

1113
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:57,790
he talks about how he helps people who 
have phobias.

1114
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,680
For instance,
someone who has a phobia of a dog.

1115
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:02,390
He's like,
so fear is like one dog,

1116
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,400
this dog bit you and your child,
you're scared of that dog phobia is this

1117
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:08,620
dog bit you and you're scared of all 
dogs.

1118
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:11,230
Now some people are so terrified they 
get these phobias.

1119
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:13,960
They can't even leave their house.
Like they're so scared of the neighbor's

1120
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:17,170
dog walking by and going to jump out of 
anywhere and bite them.

1121
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,740
So they're crippled by these fears.
And he could put them in a hypnotic 

1122
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,480
state and kind of go back and remove 
that fear essentially.

1123
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,950
That makes sense.
I mean,

1124
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,710
I think that there's a,
as he said,

1125
00:48:29,711 --> 00:48:34,711
there's a bunch of layers to the mind,
but I think that one of the most 

1126
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,490
fascinating aspects of it is when they 
do those comedy hypnotism shows,

1127
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,070
those comedy hypnotism shows are 100 
percent real.

1128
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,480
Like I've seen them live.
Like there was a guy named Frank Santos 

1129
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,260
was a big comedy hypnotist.
Guy In Boston and his son still does it.

1130
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:52,261
Frank Santos Junior.
But Frank Santos would do this show 

1131
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:53,050
weekly show it stitches and all these 
comedians.

1132
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:58,051
We would come from like all over the 
town to watch this because we couldn't 

1133
00:48:58,051 --> 00:48:58,051
believe it.
We were like,

1134
00:48:58,051 --> 00:49:02,371
how the fuck is he doing this?
And he would get people and he would 

1135
00:49:02,371 --> 00:49:02,371
know when they were under and when they 
were an under.

1136
00:49:02,371 --> 00:49:03,490
Like you would know when people are 
faking it,

1137
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:08,530
when they weren't.
He would get them off the stage when 

1138
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:08,530
they're faking it.
But the people that we're really under,

1139
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,090
you could see.
They just were baffled.

1140
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,520
And I,
and he couldn't explain why it would 

1141
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:15,520
work on some people and why it wouldn't 
work on others.

1142
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:15,520
He didn't really know.

1143
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,350
Yeah.
I asked mark the same question because 

1144
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:20,350
he,
he,

1145
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:23,111
he'll invite as many people that want to
volunteer out of the audience as you 

1146
00:49:23,111 --> 00:49:24,860
want.
So he'll get 30 plus people up there and

1147
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,010
he'll just pick people off as they are,
aren't into it.

1148
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,710
But he has people doing the craziest 
funny things,

1149
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:31,190
you know?

1150
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,680
Yeah.
And it's so funny.

1151
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,530
It's bizarre because you're like,
how are all these people in on this?

1152
00:49:35,531 --> 00:49:37,750
Well they're not.
They really do like this.

1153
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:40,270
The Frank Santos used to have this 
person.

1154
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:43,060
This is like in the eighties,
back when Madonna was hot.

1155
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,880
Like if you said you're going to have 
sex with Madonna now guys would go,

1156
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:46,720
Hey,
what the fuck?

1157
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,980
That looks good for her age.
For her age.

1158
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,560
That's the big part though.
For her age.

1159
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:54,060
Yeah,
right.

1160
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:55,300
She still looks great.
I mean,

1161
00:49:55,301 --> 00:50:00,301
no,
but everyone knows even if she looks 

1162
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:00,301
great,
everyone knows that pitches like 60,

1163
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:00,301
like,
you know,

1164
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:02,860
like I say bitch with all due respect 
this piano like a bad bitch,

1165
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,990
bad ass bad.
But um,

1166
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:10,530
but you would watch him like he would 
talk someone into believing that they 

1167
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,010
were having sex and Madonna and these 
guys have the orgasm in their pants.

1168
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:15,200
So like you'd see them go,
like he would tell them and you know,

1169
00:50:15,201 --> 00:50:17,350
and now you're going to come in your 
pants and you'd see the guy go,

1170
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,570
oh,
when you're watching it,

1171
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,200
you're watching.
You'd be like,

1172
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:26,310
what in the fuck is this real?
You almost want to go,

1173
00:50:26,311 --> 00:50:27,860
jude,
I want to see your underwear.

1174
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:28,100
Let's

1175
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,790
say it.
Yeah.

1176
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:30,900
I want to see if it worked.
It was,

1177
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:35,950
I can see the proof in the pudding,
but frank tried to explain to us he had 

1178
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:40,121
worked with people where it would help 
people quit smoking and things along 

1179
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:40,880
those lines.
But until Vinny shoreman did it to me,

1180
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:42,110
I really,
I had no idea.

1181
00:50:42,111 --> 00:50:47,111
I was like,
I still haven't been hypnotized by fema 

1182
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:47,111
to try it.
It's going to be in the United States.

1183
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:50,470
I'll connect you guys together.
You would like it because he's used to 

1184
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:51,230
working with fighters and he's.
He's great about like setting a mindset.

1185
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:56,231
I think Ian Mccall worked with them too,
but he's great about putting you in a 

1186
00:50:56,231 --> 00:50:59,981
certain state of mind and working on 
various aspects of like maybe your 

1187
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:02,060
performance or or your attitudes.
Yeah.

1188
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:04,310
It's interesting.
Well that's all about staying woke.

1189
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,970
Stay woke.
He's woke you.

1190
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,220
I want some net achieve wokeness.

1191
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:13,070
Super,
super important to achieve wokeness.

1192
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:18,840
Yeah,
I mean the mind is a really fascinating 

1193
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,760
thing and I think that especially for 
fighters,

1194
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:25,090
I would have to say that it's just one 
of the most important aspects of your 

1195
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:27,650
ability to perform.
Like physically is one thing,

1196
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:30,560
but the ability to like you're inside 
the cage,

1197
00:51:30,561 --> 00:51:33,470
the pin goes into the gate.
Are you ready?

1198
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,330
Are you ready?
Let's get it on.

1199
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:38,630
I mean that is the craziest moment in 
all sports.

1200
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:43,690
There's no moment like that where you.
I mean think about like a basketball 

1201
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:44,150
player,
basketball players.

1202
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,430
Even if there's a lot of pressure for a 
three point shot,

1203
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:51,460
if you miss that three point shot,
you're going to get another shot 

1204
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:51,460
somewhere in the game.
Someone's going to hand you the ball.

1205
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:56,050
Luckily,
or if not someone's gonna hang up all 

1206
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:56,050
tomorrow or someone will hand you the 
ball next week,

1207
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,650
but if you say,
if you fight,

1208
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:58,830
you know,

1209
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,130
between team sports and individual 
sports too,

1210
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,260
for sure.
I mean it's like when you lose,

1211
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,920
sometimes it's not unless you.
The kicker on the football team and like

1212
00:52:07,921 --> 00:52:09,790
you literally cost them but it.
But it's still like a,

1213
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,120
you know,
it's still a team sport.

1214
00:52:12,121 --> 00:52:17,121
Your team,
your team obviously didn't get you far 

1215
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:17,121
enough to where you had to rely on that 
kick,

1216
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:17,760
but you go inside the cages is just you.

1217
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:23,060
It's not just you,
it's just you involved in the most 

1218
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,060
humbling,
dangerous,

1219
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,170
extreme version of a contest between two
human beings.

1220
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:30,600
You can get outside of sword fighting,
you know,

1221
00:52:30,601 --> 00:52:35,601
outside of fighting to the death.
There's nothing is extreme as a cage 

1222
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:35,601
fight.
When you guys,

1223
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,560
I have to laugh when people say like 
that.

1224
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:40,000
We're scared to fight someone,
you know,

1225
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:40,810
like people were like,
oh,

1226
00:52:40,811 --> 00:52:44,370
you're scared to fight holly again.
Like you can't listen to those people.

1227
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,440
Scared is not a relative.
Like it's not a term that I feel like 

1228
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:49,440
fighters really.
We don't,

1229
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,390
we don't have scared the way normal 
people have scared,

1230
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,560
you know?
Yeah.

1231
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:55,690
Like a normal person would be scared to,
to,

1232
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:58,090
to get off their couch and go to the 
gym,

1233
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:03,091
you know,
to spar something like that's what we 

1234
00:53:03,091 --> 00:53:03,091
do.
Like we live like what most people would

1235
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:04,650
shit their pants

1236
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:08,690
and you would have to be a fool to not 
know that it's a dangerous fight.

1237
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,600
So it's not a matter of not being aware 
of the danger,

1238
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:15,140
but it's a matter of managing the 
consequences are like,

1239
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,870
I think you did a fantastic job with the
holly fight,

1240
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:21,530
like literally you did in that fight 
other than the fifth round,

1241
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,600
which is the most amazing part of it.
But you did everything.

1242
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:27,390
Like when we were about like what you 
have to do to beat her.

1243
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,740
I'm like,
she's got to stay on the outside.

1244
00:53:28,741 --> 00:53:32,000
She could have very her rhythm and she's
got let holly come to her like she,

1245
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:34,650
she can't rush in because you rush into 
holly.

1246
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:38,340
It's like Russian into Machida are 
rushing to anybody who's a great counter

1247
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:43,341
striker and you saw the Rhonda fight.
Ronda just came bulldog and honor and 

1248
00:53:43,341 --> 00:53:45,240
tried to out bulldogger and you just.
You can't do that with holly.

1249
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,250
She's too fast.
Footwork to her,

1250
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,620
her striking is so precise.
Her,

1251
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,330
her counters are so clean

1252
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,930
movements,
very hard to read.

1253
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,960
Like it's very unpredictable.
I remember what a couple times I tried 

1254
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,660
to maybe come forward and get her to get
to the fence and I couldn't tell whether

1255
00:53:59,661 --> 00:54:01,340
she was going to jet out to the right of
the left.

1256
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:04,330
Like usually like two steps back left 
and I was like,

1257
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:05,030
ah,
you know,

1258
00:54:05,031 --> 00:54:10,031
like I couldn't even tell like she had 
gave no indication of which way she was 

1259
00:54:10,031 --> 00:54:10,031
going to go.

1260
00:54:10,031 --> 00:54:13,520
Yeah.
Well you just did a fantastic job of 

1261
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,461
varying.
Your approach to your speed was 

1262
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:16,461
different.
Like you,

1263
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:16,980
you,
you did a lot of fainting,

1264
00:54:16,981 --> 00:54:21,981
you varied things up a lot and you could
tell like she was like almost like 

1265
00:54:21,981 --> 00:54:25,551
waiting for these moments to happen when
you're going to come forward and then 

1266
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:26,940
you wouldn't come forward and then it 
becomes like a test of patience,

1267
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,490
like who's going to get outside of their
comfort zone,

1268
00:54:29,491 --> 00:54:32,550
who's going to take chances?
Who's gonna who's gonna engage.

1269
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:37,570
Yeah.
And she also has that weird stance to 

1270
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:40,280
was she kinda halfway stands like a 
boxer and halfway stands like a karate 

1271
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,731
person.
She throws like a lot of side kicks on 

1272
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:43,731
the front leg techniques.
Yeah,

1273
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:44,220
she,
she's,

1274
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:49,250
she's a tricky one,
but we put together a really good game 

1275
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:49,250
plan.
I was happy with that.

1276
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:49,250
Yeah,
you did.

1277
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,840
I was happy,
but it was a fifth round.

1278
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,330
Fifth round was crazy.
God,

1279
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:59,331
when you grabbed a hold of her and then 
eventually got her back and got her to 

1280
00:54:59,331 --> 00:55:02,430
the ground.
It was so crazy because every aspect of,

1281
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,450
from your initial entrance to the 
takedown to getting her back,

1282
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:08,820
there was nothing.
One hundred percent about it.

1283
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:11,310
It was all touch and go.
It was all scramble.

1284
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:15,750
It wasn't like you had complete total 
control over like maybe like Damien Maia

1285
00:55:15,751 --> 00:55:20,751
versus Rick Story.
Like he daymond my gets rick stories 

1286
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:23,211
back.
He's got them locked up and then he 

1287
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:23,211
anaconda asm and squeezes them and then 
it gets them.

1288
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:27,560
It wasn't like that.
It was like you were fighting for your 

1289
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,110
fucking life and you knew there was no 
time.

1290
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:33,240
There was no time.
You were likely down by like at least 

1291
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,481
one round and you were headed into the 
fifth and final round and maybe if you 

1292
00:55:35,481 --> 00:55:35,700
won that round you could have got the 
decision,

1293
00:55:35,701 --> 00:55:37,170
but fuck,
you're fighting the champ.

1294
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,460
Yeah.
Who knows?

1295
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:43,490
Who knows what's gonna Happen?
You take our back and then when she 

1296
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:46,521
tries to shake you off the top and you 
hang in there and you hang in there and 

1297
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:47,100
you see what you like.
And I watched them like,

1298
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,600
oh my God,
she's going to go out.

1299
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,510
And when she went out and you climbed 
off her and she was unconscious like,

1300
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:54,510
Holy Shit,
Holy Shit.

1301
00:55:54,511 --> 00:55:57,330
What a moment.
That was incredible.

1302
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,290
It was incredible.
It was one of the best moments in all of

1303
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:05,280
women's championship fighting as far as 
like like an extreme,

1304
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,540
extremely dramatic moment where like 
you're,

1305
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:12,480
you're trying to accomplish something.
She's fighting tooth and claw.

1306
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:17,481
Neither one of you are exhausted,
so it's not like anyone's like 

1307
00:56:17,481 --> 00:56:19,260
physically compromised.
It's just a fucking mad scramble between

1308
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:24,261
two killers and you get her and got her 
back and then you get back and you sink 

1309
00:56:24,261 --> 00:56:28,861
the choke and she's trying to fucking 
shake you off and you hung in there and 

1310
00:56:28,861 --> 00:56:29,620
when she rolled and you're on top of her
and you,

1311
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,540
you,
you hung onto it and you realize like,

1312
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,460
oh my God,
she's going out.

1313
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,260
And she is.
She didn't even tap.

1314
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:39,100
She was throwing punches in the air 
while you were choking her unconscious.

1315
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:39,980
I kept thinking

1316
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:40,950
to myself,
I'm like,

1317
00:56:40,951 --> 00:56:43,110
when is she going to tap?
It didn't in my,

1318
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,600
in that instinctual moment.
I'm so used to,

1319
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,670
in training you get people in a choke,
you know they tap.

1320
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:49,170
So I'm waiting for that tap and I'm 
like,

1321
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,780
God,
like when is this girl going to tap?

1322
00:56:51,781 --> 00:56:53,300
Like I know I've got her.
What does she mean to,

1323
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:54,710
you know,
tap on it and then,

1324
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,530
then I felt her,
I saw her from my peripherals,

1325
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,740
kind of do,
do something.

1326
00:56:58,741 --> 00:57:03,741
I wasn't quite sure if she was tapping 
or what she was doing until I watched 

1327
00:57:03,741 --> 00:57:03,741
the video later and then I felt him pull
me off and I'm like,

1328
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,680
that's the feeling that we fight for is 
that feeling that,

1329
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,780
that feeling of like I did it,
I established my dominance,

1330
00:57:09,781 --> 00:57:10,290
you know,
it's,

1331
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:10,700
it's,
uh,

1332
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,660
you know,
as a prideful sport in some ways,

1333
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:17,661
you know,
it's hand to hand combat with someone 

1334
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:17,661
else.
It's like,

1335
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:17,661
you know,
I,

1336
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:17,661
I did it tonight.
I was better

1337
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:22,940
to be prideful because otherwise there's
just certain sacrifices in certain fires

1338
00:57:22,941 --> 00:57:27,941
that you're not going to walk through.
Like you have to have every fucking 

1339
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:28,220
motivation.
You have to be Zen,

1340
00:57:28,221 --> 00:57:33,221
but you also have to have an ego.
There has to be so many things going on 

1341
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:34,610
for you to achieve that highest level of
greatness.

1342
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,240
Again,
on a tight rope,

1343
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:41,590
you know,
people that are just like that perfect 

1344
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:41,590
balance.
You know,

1345
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:41,880
I'm walking between buildings that are,
you know,

1346
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,000
hundreds of stories high or you know,
and then it's like,

1347
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,290
it's,
it's Kinda like that.

1348
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:48,000
I mean,
you have to have the perfect balance and

1349
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:50,400
everything has to meet perfectly and 
that moment,

1350
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,230
including the training camp,
not overtraining.

1351
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:56,430
Did you ever hear that video that the 
video is not that good?

1352
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,050
But the audio is,
is awesome.

1353
00:57:58,051 --> 00:58:00,990
It's between the fourth and fifth round 
and it's my corners,

1354
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,270
what they're telling me between fourth 
and fifth round.

1355
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,390
It's such an emotional video for me.
When I watched it,

1356
00:58:06,391 --> 00:58:11,391
it makes me relive that moment.
And Brian came in there and essentially 

1357
00:58:11,391 --> 00:58:11,910
he was like,
Misha,

1358
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:14,910
you've got to get after you got it.
You have got to put your chin down.

1359
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,170
And Mike Tyson,
this chick.

1360
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,760
And that basically means just get after 
her,

1361
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:18,360
like,
get,

1362
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,320
get in there,
get after it,

1363
00:58:19,321 --> 00:58:21,570
take the risk,
risk getting knocked out,

1364
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:23,850
go for broke.
And um,

1365
00:58:23,851 --> 00:58:24,670
it goes,
you know,

1366
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,720
plays into the round and basically 
you're just telling me fucking Mike 

1367
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,260
Tyson her like get after her bulldog or 
do whatever you've got to do.

1368
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:32,550
Is that because you're running out of 
time,

1369
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:36,140
and I remember in that fifth round still
trying to get out of that,

1370
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:40,020
that mindset of like,
I to find the perfect opportunity.

1371
00:58:40,021 --> 00:58:42,660
I have to be patient because the whole 
training camp was,

1372
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:48,020
you know,
patient but persistent patient but 

1373
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:48,020
persistent.
No one run into anything because you,

1374
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:48,660
you know,
you'll get caught,

1375
00:58:48,661 --> 00:58:49,950
you get knocked out,
you'll get need,

1376
00:58:49,951 --> 00:58:51,450
you'll get kicked,
you'll get punched.

1377
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,860
So don't do that,
but you've got to look for the,

1378
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,760
the opening when it's the right timing,
it's all about timing.

1379
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:00,630
And after I took her down in that second
round and I just beat her up that round,

1380
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:06,500
she was so.
I'm so cautious in the third and fourth 

1381
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:06,540
and so perfect,
you know,

1382
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:08,370
her game plan was perfect to,
to beat me,

1383
00:59:08,371 --> 00:59:11,940
to stay just far enough out of the range
and keep me from not wanting to come in.

1384
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,720
I couldn't find in a perfect opening.
It couldn't get in on anything.

1385
00:59:15,721 --> 00:59:17,010
There wasn't mistakes that she was 
making.

1386
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:19,800
And then in the fifth round I just 
decided,

1387
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,220
you know,
going to have to,

1388
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:24,410
you're gonna have to take the chance of 
getting knocked out.

1389
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,090
This is,
this is what it's boiling down to.

1390
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:30,680
Now you've got like three minutes left 
on the clock and now it's do or die.

1391
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,070
It's either you go in there,
you,

1392
00:59:32,071 --> 00:59:33,890
you go for it,
you do Russian,

1393
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:36,320
she catches you,
you get knocked out,

1394
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:41,321
you know,
you gave it everything you got or you 

1395
00:59:41,321 --> 00:59:41,321
don't make something happen.
When have finished the fight,

1396
00:59:41,321 --> 00:59:43,810
the question was really like whether the
second round was a 10,

1397
00:59:43,811 --> 00:59:46,960
eight round on all three judges score 
cards.

1398
00:59:46,961 --> 00:59:47,820
It was,
yeah,

1399
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:50,440
I was watching it.
That's what the judges said.

1400
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:52,520
Well it should have been but.
But what I'm.

1401
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:56,320
What I meant was the question watching.
It was like I want like when we were,

1402
00:59:56,321 --> 00:59:58,900
when you were headed into the fifth 
round with my question was,

1403
00:59:58,901 --> 01:00:01,960
was I wonder if she got a ten eight 
round for that second round.

1404
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:05,050
Because if she did then this is like,
this is even fight.

1405
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,930
So what's happening right now?
Like what?

1406
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:09,820
How the judge is looking at it going 
into the fifth round.

1407
01:00:09,821 --> 01:00:11,350
It was even.
Yeah,

1408
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,180
it was tied.
That's crazy.

1409
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,540
That was such a crazy moment.
Does another time.

1410
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:21,570
The Indian,
the postcode interview where almost 

1411
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:22,120
cried like a bitch.
I get so emotional.

1412
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,440
Yeah,
it was,

1413
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,250
it was incredible.

1414
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:29,280
Well,
it's so hard to explain to someone when 

1415
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:29,280
you're there and you,
you,

1416
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,020
you get to see someone like you who's 
worked so hard for something for so 

1417
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:34,020
long,
you know.

1418
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,190
So when I said to you like,
how does that sound?

1419
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:37,210
Like,
what does it sound like?

1420
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,990
You're the new women's bantamweight 
champion of the world.

1421
01:00:40,991 --> 01:00:44,710
Like what does that sound?
And you were just so overwhelmed.

1422
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:49,740
It was so crazy.
Like just to be right next to you while 

1423
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:49,740
you were saying that and you said when 
you said,

1424
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,650
I'm waiting for you to say that for so 
long.

1425
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:53,500
It was crazy.
It was crazy moment craze.

1426
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,540
Yeah,
because I,

1427
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,960
you know,
what's crazy about the mind and the 

1428
01:00:59,960 --> 01:00:59,960
power of it.
I've,

1429
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,360
I had visualized that moment so many 
times that I felt like I was confused in

1430
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:06,530
that it was hard for me to distinguish 
that that was the real moment

1431
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:09,080
I would,
I would imagine it was so.

1432
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:14,110
It was so surreal.
I would imagine that to this day it 

1433
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,800
probably seems fake cats.
Really Weird.

1434
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,930
Yeah.
Sometimes I have to go back and be like,

1435
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:18,860
man,
that really did.

1436
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:22,940
It really happened.
It really happened right there.

1437
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:24,050
Oh,
it's pumped,

1438
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,070
Jay.
Thank you guys.

1439
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:28,710
So excited.
If you had like,

1440
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:31,030
if ours were real,
you know,

1441
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:36,090
like fucking.
If you had ci it was coming off your 

1442
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:36,090
body for sure.

1443
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:40,300
The whole,
the whole state of fallen over in bed,

1444
01:01:40,301 --> 01:01:41,420
shaking papers,

1445
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:45,330
cups flying through the air and carpet 
would rip.

1446
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:46,530
Okay.
That's gracious.

1447
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:47,750
Yeah.
That was the best one.

1448
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,370
Best moments in my life for sure.
I can only imagine.

1449
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:54,480
I can only imagine.
I mean anyone that watches that sport,

1450
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:58,200
that moment when you choked her out and 
in the whole exchange of the.

1451
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:03,350
Well,
even like the really the whole fight 

1452
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,440
because fight is like.
I mean in a weird way.

1453
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:09,470
I mean we call this martial arts and 
there's a lot of people that have a 

1454
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:12,201
problem with that,
but in my mind that there is an art to 

1455
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:15,651
what you guys did in that fight and even
what holly did because up until that 

1456
01:02:15,651 --> 01:02:18,780
fifth round mean like you said,
especially the third and fourth.

1457
01:02:18,781 --> 01:02:20,130
She was what she wanted to do.

1458
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:23,190
She was shoes and there was a display 
going on.

1459
01:02:23,191 --> 01:02:28,191
There was a,
there was a performance going on on top 

1460
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:28,810
of this being a competition to watch it.
I,

1461
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,660
someone's sitting there watching it and 
calling it.

1462
01:02:30,661 --> 01:02:35,661
I mean this is a work of art and to have
it in that way which is such a masterful

1463
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:40,080
performance was such a masterpiece 
moment and that to me is like one of the

1464
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:45,081
best moments in mma because it's such a 
fucking hard thing to achieve to become 

1465
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:51,201
a champion.
And for someone like you had tried and 

1466
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:53,691
tried again.
He won the title in strikeforce and 

1467
01:02:53,691 --> 01:02:54,540
you're trying and trying again and 
trying to make this happen and you know,

1468
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:59,541
you think you're getting boxed out and 
then the Rhonda fight didn't happen 

1469
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:00,040
after you beat Jessica.
Hi.

1470
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:05,050
And then all of a sudden you have this 
opportunity and they comes to together 

1471
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,310
in one of the most powerful ways we've 
ever seen inside the octagon.

1472
01:03:08,311 --> 01:03:09,630
It was amazing.
Well,

1473
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:10,230
thank you.

1474
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:15,490
That was a,
that was quite a great narration of 

1475
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:16,060
everything that's had to happen to make 
this country,

1476
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:16,580
you know,
and it,

1477
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:20,060
it's uh,
it's crazy because it was 10 years,

1478
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:22,550
the same month,
10 years,

1479
01:03:22,551 --> 01:03:24,690
the like the month,
um,

1480
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:27,740
that I had had my first fight.
Wow.

1481
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,150
It's been 10 years.
Yeah.

1482
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:34,330
So it's crazy because you think 10 years
ago there wasn't even a women's ever 

1483
01:03:34,631 --> 01:03:36,650
made was a joke.
Like it was.

1484
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:38,270
I mean,
to me it wasn't obviously,

1485
01:03:38,271 --> 01:03:40,760
but to most people it was a spectacle at
best.

1486
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:43,490
Something they kind of threw on the card
is kind of like,

1487
01:03:43,491 --> 01:03:44,330
ah Ha,
you know,

1488
01:03:44,331 --> 01:03:45,890
watch the chicks fight.
You know,

1489
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,380
hopefully it'll pop out,
you know,

1490
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:56,240
because they didn't respect us as 
athletes.

1491
01:03:56,241 --> 01:03:56,990
You know?
That's,

1492
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:58,060
that's what we,
that's,

1493
01:03:58,130 --> 01:03:59,630
that's the,
that's the honest truth.

1494
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,270
That's the uphill battle that it was 
like nobody took it seriously.

1495
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:07,271
We didn't make any money.
We were fighting for bread crumbs at 

1496
01:04:07,271 --> 01:04:08,600
best and kept you going during those 
times.

1497
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,350
The Passion,
as Cliche as it sounds,

1498
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:17,430
I'm just the desire to want to be 
fulfilled and I felt like that was the 

1499
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:21,170
most fulfilling thing in my life.
It wasn't college.

1500
01:04:21,171 --> 01:04:22,520
It wasn't,
it wasn't.

1501
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:24,090
There was nothing else that was 
fulfilling.

1502
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:29,740
But what is it about fighting that 
attracted you to it when there wasn't 

1503
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:34,011
any clear future because you were in it 
at a time.

1504
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:34,300
Think

1505
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,190
about the future.
Too much early on now.

1506
01:04:36,191 --> 01:04:37,930
I didn't think about it as something 
that was,

1507
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:41,020
this needs to be lucrative for me.
This needs to be,

1508
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:46,770
you know,
coming to some of it was I was probably 

1509
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:51,750
three years into my career before I even
thought that I could maybe like actually

1510
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:58,140
possibly make a living at this,
so it was just something that I was 

1511
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:58,720
doing to feel alive.
Wow.

1512
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:04,170
Yeah.
It was just something that I was doing 

1513
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:04,170
to,
to make me feel accomplished.

1514
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:08,750
It,
you can't put a price on how something 

1515
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:08,750
makes you feel,
you know,

1516
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:12,310
a memory and experience happiness.
You know,

1517
01:05:12,311 --> 01:05:13,270
those emotions.
You know,

1518
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,270
people say like the day that they got 
married,

1519
01:05:15,271 --> 01:05:17,060
the day that they had their kid,
the day you,

1520
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,690
those are like mile markers in people's 
lives.

1521
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:21,490
Like I guess if you ask someone on their
deathbed,

1522
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,190
what were the moments that made you feel
alive?

1523
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:27,040
Like what did your life amount to what,
what was that?

1524
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:32,350
Those key markers in your life?
And all of my fights have been markers 

1525
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:33,370
in my life that's more than most people 
can say.

1526
01:05:33,371 --> 01:05:38,371
You know,
so I guess it was such a sense of 

1527
01:05:38,371 --> 01:05:38,980
fulfillment and now the fact that it was
so hard,

1528
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:44,090
it was,
it was so hard and so many people were 

1529
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:46,321
so against me.
I think that made me really determined 

1530
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:46,321
to.
Because a lot of people,

1531
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:46,660
my Grandpa,
my dad,

1532
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:50,440
my grandpa was really,
he was chauvinistic to be quite honest.

1533
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:55,441
He was not,
he was embarrassed that his 

1534
01:05:55,441 --> 01:05:55,441
granddaughter was a fighter and he would
give my dad a hard time all the time,

1535
01:05:55,441 --> 01:05:56,470
like,
why you let your daughter do that?

1536
01:05:56,471 --> 01:05:58,150
And he's like,
don't let her do anything.

1537
01:05:58,151 --> 01:05:59,260
She just,
she's her own person.

1538
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:02,260
I'm not proud of it,
but my grandpa,

1539
01:06:02,261 --> 01:06:02,710
he's not.

1540
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:04,330
But he,
um,

1541
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:09,360
had a big change of heart when I,
when I actually lost my title too,

1542
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,630
when I won my title against Marley's 
spoon and,

1543
01:06:16,631 --> 01:06:19,240
you know,
he really became obviously big fan,

1544
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:21,160
you know,
he's very proud of you.

1545
01:06:21,161 --> 01:06:22,900
I'm talking to my neighbors about you.
He's like,

1546
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:26,950
I was wrong.
And I lost my fight to Rhonda,

1547
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:32,100
right.
Be Right when he got diagnosed with 

1548
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:32,100
cancer.
And um,

1549
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,000
that's eventually what passed away.
Um,

1550
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,970
so I went straight from that fight down 
to see him,

1551
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:39,910
to see how he was doing and my dad was 
down there visiting.

1552
01:06:39,911 --> 01:06:42,070
He lives in Florida so very,
very far away.

1553
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,840
And I told them,
I was like,

1554
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:44,440
Grandpa,
I was like,

1555
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:46,540
I'm really sorry that I didn't win this,
you know,

1556
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,090
when it makes me emotional.
I was like,

1557
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,450
I'm sorry I didn't win this fight for 
you.

1558
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:50,530
And he's like,
it doesn't matter,

1559
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:51,930
you know?

1560
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:56,880
And I think that's the last fight that 
he ever saw unfortunately.

1561
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:57,760
But,
you know,

1562
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:58,210
he's like,
Hey,

1563
01:06:58,211 --> 01:07:00,670
you had a lot of heart and so proud of 
you.

1564
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,440
So yeah.
Were you attracted to other extreme 

1565
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,340
sports when you were younger?
No,

1566
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:13,350
because I wasn't raised that way.
I wasn't raised with like extreme 

1567
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:13,350
sports,
like,

1568
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:14,590
um,
yeah,

1569
01:07:14,591 --> 01:07:17,410
my dad's still saw me as even segregate 
me,

1570
01:07:17,411 --> 01:07:17,970
I wouldn't say,
but he,

1571
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,190
he saw me as a,
you know,

1572
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:24,210
it was a little girl,
like he didn't take me four wheeling or 

1573
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:24,210
um,
you know,

1574
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,390
riding dirt bikes or anything like that.
He took me down hill,

1575
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:27,940
not downhill mountain biking,
but it kind of turned into that.

1576
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:32,941
We rode for miles out to a lake with my,
with my little brother and a friend of 

1577
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:35,470
his.
And then um,

1578
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:40,590
I remember I was riding back and there 
was like big rocks and boulders and my 

1579
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:44,791
dad and his buddy have have had downhill
mountain bikes may for I'm writing like 

1580
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:44,910
a little street bikes,
but they're,

1581
01:07:44,911 --> 01:07:46,750
they're expecting that I'm just going to
be able to,

1582
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:51,751
like,
I'll just carry down the hill or 

1583
01:07:51,751 --> 01:07:51,751
whatever.

1584
01:07:51,751 --> 01:07:53,430
I try to bomb down the same rock hill.
Them I eat shit like bad each and I 

1585
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,900
still have scars on my elbow actually 
hear from,

1586
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:56,980
from when I,
uh,

1587
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:00,730
when I fell and I just got up and my dad
says,

1588
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,010
this is like one of the moments I 
realize you were different.

1589
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,900
He's like,
you just popped up and you're like,

1590
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,630
frustrated was off.
He got back on your bike,

1591
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,330
bombed down the rest of the hill and be 
all of us home.

1592
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:12,820
Like,
you're just crazy.

1593
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:14,140
He's like,
I never saw anything like that.

1594
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:15,560
I thought you're right that we were 
gonna have to like,

1595
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,570
you know,
call,

1596
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:19,310
call medical help.
And I thought [inaudible],

1597
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:20,930
he's like,
you ate at heart,

1598
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:22,010
and it was like,

1599
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,690
so it was just something that was just 
in you,

1600
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,130
I guess just deal.

1601
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,730
I don't know.
My mom always told me,

1602
01:08:27,731 --> 01:08:30,250
and this something I realized when I was
talking to mark hypnosis,

1603
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:35,490
he's telling me about how much children 
can be affected by people who are 

1604
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:36,820
negative in their life with people who 
can,

1605
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:42,060
you know,
you're never gonna amount to anything 

1606
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:42,060
and how that can affect the subconscious
mind.

1607
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:42,220
You know,
having a dad who's like,

1608
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,050
you suck,
you're terrible.

1609
01:08:44,051 --> 01:08:45,340
You're never gonna be,
you know,

1610
01:08:45,341 --> 01:08:50,341
you're never gonna be anything.
How that can create crippling ripple 

1611
01:08:50,341 --> 01:08:54,001
effects that,
that translate on all the way through 

1612
01:08:54,001 --> 01:08:54,001
the rest of that person's life.
And I said,

1613
01:08:54,001 --> 01:08:54,460
well,
what if it's the opposite?

1614
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:59,760
Like what if you had a parent that was 
telling you that you're amazing all the 

1615
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,641
time,
that you could do whatever you want and 

1616
01:09:02,641 --> 01:09:02,641
they really true heartedly believe in 
you.

1617
01:09:02,641 --> 01:09:02,641
He's like,
Oh yeah,

1618
01:09:02,641 --> 01:09:03,550
that can,
that can be amazing.

1619
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:04,690
You know?
Amazing too.

1620
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,910
And it made me start thinking because my
mom and I,

1621
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:10,750
we've had a really rough relationship 
the past three,

1622
01:09:10,751 --> 01:09:12,690
four years or so,
maybe,

1623
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,620
maybe longer.
It's been a struggle.

1624
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:15,790
We're,
it's getting better,

1625
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:18,500
but I will give her a ton of credit that
as,

1626
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:24,020
as a single mom for part of my life 
growing up and even not single,

1627
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:29,670
she,
she never made me feel like I wasn't 

1628
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:29,670
capable of doing anything.
If I,

1629
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:29,680
if,
if anything,

1630
01:09:29,681 --> 01:09:34,681
she always made me feel like I could be 
and do whatever I want and I could be 

1631
01:09:34,681 --> 01:09:36,550
the best at it.
Like most people when I would go five,

1632
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:37,300
six,
seven,

1633
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:39,940
eight years old and I want to be an 
astronaut.

1634
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:40,930
Like every little kid,
they're like,

1635
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:41,620
yeah,
yeah,

1636
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,660
you know,
Oh,

1637
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:47,840
you know,
on my grandpa was the first one to be 

1638
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:47,840
like,
that's not realistic.

1639
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:47,860
You're not going to be,
you know,

1640
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:49,240
not going to be.
Actually my mom was like,

1641
01:09:49,241 --> 01:09:50,620
no,
you will just like,

1642
01:09:50,621 --> 01:09:51,460
you will,
like,

1643
01:09:51,461 --> 01:09:53,140
if that's what you want to do,
that you will.

1644
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:54,210
It's like,
she's like Misha,

1645
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:57,070
whatever you want to do,
you will be the best at it.

1646
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,390
Well,
I think it's probably good to have both.

1647
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:04,530
It's probably good to have someone who 
wholeheartedly believes in you and 

1648
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:07,211
someone else who's like doubting you.
Sort of like a little motivation to 

1649
01:10:07,211 --> 01:10:09,240
prove them wrong.
The other person rise.

1650
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:10,580
I,
I feed off of that.

1651
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,800
I love proving people wrong.
Love it.

1652
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:16,910
You're a very even tempered person,
which is very unusual for a fighter.

1653
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:21,970
You're very feminine,
but you're also very flat and very 

1654
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:22,040
relaxed.
You're very like,

1655
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:27,430
this is Meesha.
Like this is how you are like it was 

1656
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:28,610
when you were on the ultimate fighter 
with Rhonda.

1657
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,840
It was when it was highlighted the most 
because she's so manic.

1658
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:37,280
She gets so hot and it's one of the 
reasons why people love her so much.

1659
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:42,340
She gets so fucking crazy and she's so 
competitive and angry that like when you

1660
01:10:42,501 --> 01:10:44,840
guys did that wall climbing thing and 
that she's like,

1661
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:46,550
fuck you,
and she's giving you the finger.

1662
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:50,330
Like you're just like you just your 
level the election,

1663
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:51,860
but how has that.
When,

1664
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:56,890
when did would.
Was that your whole life you're like 

1665
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:59,231
that?
Or is that something you learned how to 

1666
01:10:59,231 --> 01:10:59,231
do?

1667
01:10:59,231 --> 01:10:59,510
Pretty easy going my whole life.
The thing is I don't like to be stressed

1668
01:10:59,511 --> 01:11:02,300
out and I don't like to be pissed off 
and I don't like to not be happy,

1669
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:06,230
so I do everything within my power to 
not be stressed out.

1670
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:09,560
Like I can be about to miss a flight or 
has something.

1671
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:12,650
And I'm like,
well what can I do now?

1672
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:13,400
You know,
I'm just like,

1673
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:18,890
it's sometimes it's a bad thing because 
they don't plan ahead enough or I'm not 

1674
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:19,530
really good with time management because
I don't want to be.

1675
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,380
I don't ever want to rush.
So even if I'm late to something I don't

1676
01:11:22,381 --> 01:11:23,450
like to rush,
you know?

1677
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:25,890
And it just,
sometimes that's a bad thing.

1678
01:11:25,891 --> 01:11:29,190
I'm not the most organized person 
because I'm so relaxed about everything.

1679
01:11:29,191 --> 01:11:29,780
Then I'm like,
no,

1680
01:11:29,781 --> 01:11:31,410
my taxes,
I'll do those later,

1681
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,990
you know,
like that kind of thing.

1682
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,730
It sounds like a great recipe for life 
though.

1683
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:40,900
Is It on both ends?
No one does it this way.

1684
01:11:40,901 --> 01:11:41,710
Seems good.

1685
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:42,500
Yeah.
You know,

1686
01:11:42,501 --> 01:11:42,850
I,
I,

1687
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:47,280
I save save all my tension and stuff I 
guess for when I get inside the cage,

1688
01:11:47,281 --> 01:11:49,280
but I like to be relaxed.
I just like to be shown.

1689
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:51,150
I don't like to be pissed off.
I don't like to be stressed out.

1690
01:11:51,151 --> 01:11:53,070
Like what a miserable life.
I feel like,

1691
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:54,780
you know,
some people are just angry all the time.

1692
01:11:54,781 --> 01:11:57,450
Like,
like they're like perma scrooge,

1693
01:11:57,451 --> 01:11:59,790
you know,
just all the time angry.

1694
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:04,791
I'm like,
do you not even realize how bad your 

1695
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:04,791
life must suck?
Like what if,

1696
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:05,100
if you just looked at things 
differently,

1697
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:06,480
you'd have a way better life.
I'm like,

1698
01:12:06,481 --> 01:12:07,740
I never want to be that person.

1699
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:11,860
I remember Mike Tyson when he was in his
prime and they asked him about something

1700
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:14,060
and he was talking about being angry.
He's like,

1701
01:12:14,061 --> 01:12:16,390
I'm angry all the time.
I'm angry at my dog.

1702
01:12:16,391 --> 01:12:17,730
I'm angry at everybody.
I'm angry.

1703
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,780
The mailman just get the fuck out of my 
way.

1704
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:23,800
Like when he was in his prime,
he was just a ball of fury,

1705
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,200
you know,
he was just this wrecking machine,

1706
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:31,410
which is like a lot of people associate 
that with being a championship level 

1707
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:35,311
fighter,
like almost like you have to have a 

1708
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:37,591
certain level of discontent,
you have to have a certain level of 

1709
01:12:37,591 --> 01:12:38,050
anger to motivate you.
But with you,

1710
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:42,040
I think if you could look at like a 
person's graph,

1711
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:45,700
like a sound graph of how they speak 
their whole life.

1712
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:47,380
Mine would be all over the fucking 
place,

1713
01:12:47,381 --> 01:12:49,360
going up and down and be all crazy and.

1714
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:54,630
But Yours,
I feel like it'd be like this like flat 

1715
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:55,840
up in little tiny ups and downs,
like very minor ripples,

1716
01:12:55,841 --> 01:12:56,480
like,
you know,

1717
01:12:56,490 --> 01:13:01,490
like a little bit of like a flat lake 
where the water comes in a little bit,

1718
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:05,340
but it's nothing fucking crazy.
There's no tidal waves.

1719
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:06,220
No.
No chaos,

1720
01:13:06,221 --> 01:13:09,070
no tsunamis,
but you're just flat and steady.

1721
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,840
I try to be,
not always,

1722
01:13:10,841 --> 01:13:14,110
I'm still a woman,
but that's usual for a fighter,

1723
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,430
right?
This flat level sort of way.

1724
01:13:18,431 --> 01:13:21,390
And I say flat.
It almost sounds like a pejorative and I

1725
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:24,320
don't mean it that way.
I mean like a Zen,

1726
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:26,890
like you have a very zen thing going on.

1727
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,830
Yeah.
And that's,

1728
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:33,860
yeah,
I used to have issues with anxiety a 

1729
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:35,841
little bit when I was in high school and
I would like have my track meets and 

1730
01:13:35,841 --> 01:13:35,841
something and I would have anxiety 
attacks.

1731
01:13:35,841 --> 01:13:40,611
I actually have a problem with it and I 
guess I've always been a very open 

1732
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:45,981
minded person and I always asked myself 
questions whenever there's something 

1733
01:13:45,981 --> 01:13:46,200
wrong with myself or you know,
an issue that I'm having.

1734
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:48,210
I asked myself why am I having that,
you know,

1735
01:13:48,211 --> 01:13:53,211
and then,
and then it comes full circle and I was 

1736
01:13:53,211 --> 01:13:55,461
able to answer those questions in and 
then I have never suffered from anxiety 

1737
01:13:55,461 --> 01:13:58,521
since I.
So I kind of put myself in a zen state 

1738
01:13:58,521 --> 01:13:58,950
of mind early on in my career because I 
hated it so much.

1739
01:13:58,951 --> 01:14:01,290
It's like you don't want to live having 
anxiety issues.

1740
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:02,100
Like why do I have that?

1741
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,030
Why?
Why?

1742
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:03,840
What am I afraid of?
You know,

1743
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:05,100
it's like,
well,

1744
01:14:05,101 --> 01:14:10,101
I'm not,
I'm not afraid enough to where I'm not 

1745
01:14:10,101 --> 01:14:10,420
going to do it,
so let's just not make it a big,

1746
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,760
not make it something I don't like.
Obviously I do like it.

1747
01:14:12,761 --> 01:14:14,230
That's why I'm doing track.
Obviously.

1748
01:14:14,231 --> 01:14:15,430
I like MMA.
That's what I'm doing it.

1749
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,960
I don't want to make it something I 
hate.

1750
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,080
I don't want to make it something I 
don't enjoy because it's not.

1751
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:22,510
So that's not why I do this.
I do this because I love it,

1752
01:14:22,511 --> 01:14:25,450
so let's not make it something I hate 
ever.

1753
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:28,270
I try not to.
That's a very rational approach though.

1754
01:14:28,271 --> 01:14:29,790
It's very unusual for people.
Yeah.

1755
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:32,470
Like there's nothing in this life,
like if I want to do it,

1756
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:35,540
that fear is going to stop me.
Fears are realistic thing.

1757
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:36,340
It happens.
Yeah.

1758
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:37,480
It's scary to get into the cage.

1759
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:42,480
It's scary to think about losing weight 
and I've tasted the most bitter losses 

1760
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,070
you could ever dream of and it's 
devastating.

1761
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:47,500
It's crushing.
That's the most scary thing.

1762
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:52,620
It's not getting beat up.
It's not breaking your nose or breaking 

1763
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:53,740
my orbital bone or letting my arm gets 
snapped in half.

1764
01:14:53,741 --> 01:14:56,500
That's not the scary part about fighting
and what I do.

1765
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,040
The scary part is not being adequate 
enough,

1766
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:03,850
not being good enough that you're 100 
percent wasn't good enough.

1767
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,580
That's scary.
That's really scary.

1768
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:08,980
And um,
I've had that.

1769
01:15:08,981 --> 01:15:12,250
I've had to face that point blank right 
in the face many times before.

1770
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:15,520
And it's the hardest thing to do.
Bar none.

1771
01:15:15,521 --> 01:15:17,170
It's the hardest thing to look at 
yourself and be like,

1772
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:19,000
I didn't,
I wasn't enough.

1773
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,570
I wasn't enough.
No one else can be responsible for that.

1774
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,110
I fucked up.
I didn't do it.

1775
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:28,111
I have to own this and to come back from
something like that and think that you 

1776
01:15:28,111 --> 01:15:32,731
can still,
you can still get it back or you can 

1777
01:15:32,731 --> 01:15:32,731
still do it again or you could still get
better.

1778
01:15:32,731 --> 01:15:33,700
You can learn from that.
That's,

1779
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,920
that's also the challenging part of it,
you know,

1780
01:15:35,921 --> 01:15:38,400
and that's something that I've,
I've had to,

1781
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:43,420
to get to this point,
I've had to get over those situations 

1782
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,250
where I thought that my world had ended.
You know,

1783
01:15:45,251 --> 01:15:47,950
my second last or Rhonda was the most 
devastating.

1784
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,980
The first loss was devastating.
The second loss was a,

1785
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,720
like,
it was horrible.

1786
01:15:52,721 --> 01:15:55,250
I thought my world was,
was coming to an end and you know,

1787
01:15:55,251 --> 01:15:57,430
and nobody cared about my family and 
friends,

1788
01:15:57,431 --> 01:15:59,080
but the rest of world,
they don't care.

1789
01:15:59,081 --> 01:16:00,610
I don't give a shit.
They don't care about second place.

1790
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:01,930
They don't care,
you know.

1791
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,880
And um,
they're mean.

1792
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,010
People are harsh.
They're mean on social media.

1793
01:16:06,011 --> 01:16:09,340
You have to get thick skin quick.
Nobody teaches you how to deal with that

1794
01:16:09,341 --> 01:16:11,140
either.
There's no mma,

1795
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,540
social media,
101 or like you don't,

1796
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:18,600
you just sink or swim,
you figure it out or you don't either 

1797
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:18,600
bothers you or doesn't,
you know,

1798
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,840
either you yell back at everyone or you 
don't.

1799
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:20,320
You know,

1800
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:22,740
like when you're in the first generation
that's ever had to deal with.

1801
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:27,790
Yeah.
So there's never been anybody in the 

1802
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:30,231
last 10 years.
Is it new occurrence and they don't 

1803
01:16:30,231 --> 01:16:31,020
teach you how to,
how to deal with it or how to not let it

1804
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:32,850
affect you emotionally?
No one knows.

1805
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:33,660
No one knows.
I mean,

1806
01:16:33,661 --> 01:16:36,000
this is a total new field learning 
experience,

1807
01:16:36,001 --> 01:16:38,250
especially for someone who does what you
do,

1808
01:16:38,251 --> 01:16:42,720
which is the most exposed an athlete 
ever gets ever like if you lose a tennis

1809
01:16:42,721 --> 01:16:44,640
match and the world says,
hey,

1810
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:49,050
you fucking suck at tennis or whatever 
bitch move on with your life.

1811
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,130
But if you're like,
you know,

1812
01:16:50,131 --> 01:16:52,080
Rhonda beat you again,
you fucking dumb hoe.

1813
01:16:52,081 --> 01:16:53,580
And you're like,
oh my God,

1814
01:16:53,581 --> 01:16:56,740
I can't believe this.
People so goddamn mean.

1815
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,610
And it's fighting.
It's like the most primal thing.

1816
01:16:59,611 --> 01:17:02,370
So everyone,
what other sport or sports always buyout

1817
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:04,410
boiled down to and they don't like 
another person is

1818
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:09,430
fighting.
That's like the most primal way to deal 

1819
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:09,430
with something.
So once your sport is fighting,

1820
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:09,980
people like feel like

1821
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,290
that more justification to talk shit,
even though they're just like,

1822
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:17,300
Gosh,
I have to laugh because Jon Jones and 

1823
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:17,840
Daniel Cormier,
when we were in New York,

1824
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,740
they opened up the questions to the 
audience.

1825
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:27,600
I big mistake because these little 
pipsqueaks they got on the microphone.

1826
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,820
Or like,
I'm so Daniel Cormier,

1827
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:34,700
I just want to say I have a really 
important question for you.

1828
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,610
How is it going to feel when Jon Jones 
kicks your ass again?

1829
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:38,810
You know,
and I'm just like,

1830
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:40,820
you idiot.
Like if you were,

1831
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:46,120
you wouldn't have the balls to say that 
if it was just you and Daniel in this 

1832
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:49,571
room and no one was going to know the 
outcome of what happened after you said 

1833
01:17:49,571 --> 01:17:49,571
that.
Well,

1834
01:17:49,571 --> 01:17:50,690
the fact that people feel so safe that 
they can,

1835
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:55,010
can do that killer like Daniel cormier 
and then they did the same thing to John

1836
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:55,760
Jones.
Did you ever see what they did?

1837
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,950
The Rashad Evans,
Rashad Evans,

1838
01:17:57,951 --> 01:18:01,970
was that the photo signing and this guy 
comes up to him with a picture of,

1839
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:07,210
you know,
there's an iconic photo of when Leo 

1840
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:09,350
knocked him out or he's like kind of 
crumpled up against the cage and this 

1841
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:13,121
kid,
this little skinny kid with a smile on 

1842
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:16,271
his face wanted Rashad to sign that and 
we shot a crumple it up and threw it 

1843
01:18:16,271 --> 01:18:16,400
out.
I'm and looked at him like,

1844
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:18,740
are you out of your fucking mind?
Like,

1845
01:18:18,741 --> 01:18:20,330
do you know what I could do to you right
now?

1846
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:25,690
Like he tried to hurt my feelings and 
try to make me feel bad trying to punk 

1847
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:27,490
me in front of people while you have a 
camera on me because you're filming it,

1848
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:32,500
like your friends are filming this 
reaction to you sticking just his 

1849
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,000
callousness and also just being 
oblivious,

1850
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,520
like oblivious to like,
why would you want to do that?

1851
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:40,910
Why would you want to say that to John?
I don't get it.

1852
01:18:40,911 --> 01:18:44,090
Why is he so dummies grow up watching 
pro wrestling and they,

1853
01:18:44,091 --> 01:18:47,400
they don't understand that this is real.
Like you,

1854
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:52,560
like you say hello,
how's it going to feel to get your ass 

1855
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:52,940
kicked again?
What started that?

1856
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,940
Like they were expecting like some 
fucking fake thing.

1857
01:18:56,370 --> 01:19:01,370
It's like he's just oblivious to the 
idea that you're hurting someone's 

1858
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:04,610
feelings for no reason and you can also 
get caught up in it emotionally.

1859
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:05,630
Like,
you know,

1860
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:10,700
people get caught up.
Like I watched conor Mcgregor's social 

1861
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,960
media after Nate Diaz beat him and Holy 
Shit I was,

1862
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:14,300
I was saying to my friends,
I'm like,

1863
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:19,301
I hope he stays off line for a few days.
Just don't go anywhere near a computer 

1864
01:19:19,301 --> 01:19:20,000
for like a solid week.
Oh yeah.

1865
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,540
Because it's just the cons,
the concept of the world.

1866
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:26,150
Just the deluge twice for it.

1867
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:31,180
Oh,
they love it and they hate their own 

1868
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:31,560
lives is the thing is that nobody wins 
in our sport forever.

1869
01:19:31,561 --> 01:19:32,420
Like so.
You're always.

1870
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,370
You're going to have to face that at 
some point.

1871
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:38,000
It's one of the most exciting things 
about it is that it's so volatile.

1872
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:43,150
Like the Chris Weidman,
Luke rockhold fight to me is like a 

1873
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:45,941
perfect example that I often.
I see Chris Weidman training or watch 

1874
01:19:45,941 --> 01:19:46,760
videos of him training.
I'm like,

1875
01:19:46,761 --> 01:19:51,761
what is going on in his mind right now?
Because Weidman was so dominant and you 

1876
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:56,480
even in that fight,
incredibly competitive and he throws one

1877
01:19:56,481 --> 01:19:57,800
kick.
One crazy.

1878
01:19:57,801 --> 01:20:02,801
We'll kick one ill advised we'll kick 
rockhold takes him down and smashes him 

1879
01:20:02,801 --> 01:20:06,170
and I just wonder like,
how much does that kick haunt him?

1880
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:08,070
How much does that haunt him?

1881
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,620
Like how might what?
What is going on in his mind?

1882
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:15,740
Well,
here's a guy who destroys Anderson 

1883
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:15,740
Silva.
Beats the fuck out of Leo Machida.

1884
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:17,520
Vito Belfort smashes him in the first 
round,

1885
01:20:17,870 --> 01:20:20,220
you know,
you watch his fights and you just go,

1886
01:20:20,221 --> 01:20:21,250
okay,
like,

1887
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:23,790
what is this rockhold fight going to 
play off like,

1888
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:28,910
and then when rockhold beat them and 
beat them down the way he did and 

1889
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:28,910
destroys him,
like,

1890
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:30,090
oh,
we have a changing of the guard here.

1891
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,950
Like these moments,
these pivotal moments of like,

1892
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:36,360
your whole life changes you go from 
being Chris Weidman,

1893
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:41,510
UFC middleweight champion of the world,
one of the best fighters in the planet 

1894
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:44,451
to Chris Weidman,
former UFC middleweight champion of the 

1895
01:20:44,451 --> 01:20:47,961
world now hoping he gets a shot at his 
title in a rematch and now that he's got

1896
01:20:48,361 --> 01:20:49,860
it and it's going to happen soon.
It's like,

1897
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:52,320
whoa.
That the drama and the buildup,

1898
01:20:52,321 --> 01:20:55,740
like I can't imagine being him right 
now,

1899
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:59,460
like the tension that he's under right 
now and the pressure and what,

1900
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:04,650
uh,
how much emotional connection he has 

1901
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:07,221
towards this attempt to win his title 
back and how intense it's going to be 

1902
01:21:07,221 --> 01:21:07,221
once they get in there.

1903
01:21:07,221 --> 01:21:11,640
Yeah.
And they're really starting to not like 

1904
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:11,640
each other.
The last time I was here for Fox,

1905
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,240
I think it was about a month or so ago,
they were,

1906
01:21:13,241 --> 01:21:18,241
um,
they were there and there was some 

1907
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:20,971
tension.
Of course they were in studio and you 

1908
01:21:20,971 --> 01:21:20,971
could tell Chris was just a,
he was not,

1909
01:21:20,971 --> 01:21:22,720
he was,
you know,

1910
01:21:22,721 --> 01:21:27,721
he's pissed.
He's not happy with the situation and 

1911
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:27,721
Luke rockhold is kind of like,
you know,

1912
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:31,981
he's happy,
he's got the belt and he was kind of 

1913
01:21:31,981 --> 01:21:32,080
boasting it around a little bit and he's
kind of ribbing Chris,

1914
01:21:32,081 --> 01:21:34,960
you could tell like trying to get under 
his skin a little bit and Chris is like,

1915
01:21:34,961 --> 01:21:37,870
you know,
you could just tell he was like upset,

1916
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,240
like they were kind of friendly

1917
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,630
before that,
which is weird.

1918
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:41,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

1919
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:43,750
They were friendly before that,
like for a long time,

1920
01:21:43,751 --> 01:21:45,310
like there's photos of the two of them 
together,

1921
01:21:45,311 --> 01:21:48,190
smiling and not anymore.
Well,

1922
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:50,170
when a guy beats you down like that,
like,

1923
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:52,510
and you lose your title the way Weidman 
did.

1924
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:55,690
Yeah.
But Brock holds fucking good.

1925
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:56,890
He's fucking good.

1926
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,450
I saw holly,
um,

1927
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:03,470
once instance a fight and I was really 
actually kind of nervous about it 

1928
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:03,600
because I was like,
she was,

1929
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:06,300
um,
at the Jones osp fight.

1930
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:09,010
Those just happened.
And um,

1931
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:14,030
we were both of the VIP party and my 
friend Heather Clark used to train 

1932
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:14,030
heather.
Joe Clark actually fighting this weekend

1933
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:15,780
in Rotterdam.
Anyways,

1934
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:17,130
she was like,
you should go and talk to him.

1935
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:17,400
I was like,
yeah,

1936
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:18,150
I want to.
I just,

1937
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:19,320
I don't want to come off.
Like,

1938
01:22:19,321 --> 01:22:20,540
how,
what do I say?

1939
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,880
Bitch?
What do you say to someone that you 

1940
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:26,670
just,
you took the dog,

1941
01:22:26,671 --> 01:22:28,560
say hi.
That's what I did,

1942
01:22:28,561 --> 01:22:29,580
you know,
I just went up and was like,

1943
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:30,390
you know,
how are you?

1944
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:31,740
And she like,
she came out and she was like,

1945
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:37,190
no,
I'm just really bombed it in and get 

1946
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:37,190
that rematch.
I'm like,

1947
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:37,190
I know.
I was like,

1948
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:37,190
don't worry.
I was like,

1949
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:37,190
well,
we'll see each other a future.

1950
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:37,860
She's like,
yeah.

1951
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:38,730
She's like,
I hope so.

1952
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:40,320
I hope you still have it.
Just like,

1953
01:22:40,321 --> 01:22:43,440
you know,
I wanna I wanna see you again in future.

1954
01:22:43,441 --> 01:22:44,100
I'm like,
yeah,

1955
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:46,230
I totally get it.
I've been in her shoes before.

1956
01:22:46,231 --> 01:22:48,240
I know how bad that sucks and she wants 
that back,

1957
01:22:48,241 --> 01:22:50,170
but we were friendly,
but it's

1958
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,110
using her.
Both of you are so nice.

1959
01:22:52,111 --> 01:22:54,480
Like holly is one of the nicest people.
Nice.

1960
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,370
She's such a sweetheart.
Meticulously Nice.

1961
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,130
If you didn't know she was a fighter,
you'd be like no fucking way.

1962
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:01,850
And then he finishes a 19 time world 
boxing champion.

1963
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:03,390
Be like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

1964
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,860
How's that possible?
How's that?

1965
01:23:04,861 --> 01:23:06,330
Nice killer.

1966
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:09,820
Some tomfoolery.
It just doesn't make any sense.

1967
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:15,630
She doesn't fit the mold either.
Like both of you guys are really 

1968
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:18,121
interesting representatives of MMA and 
great representatives because you break 

1969
01:23:18,121 --> 01:23:18,980
that mold.
You know

1970
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,170
her manager though?
Oh yeah.

1971
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,710
Who is he?
I don't know.

1972
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:24,240
I don't even know if I've ever met him 
in person.

1973
01:23:24,241 --> 01:23:25,650
I probably haven't.
Maybe I have.

1974
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:26,880
If I did,
it wasn't memorable.

1975
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:28,040
Anyways.
Um,

1976
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:30,960
I guess he went,
like Dana went down.

1977
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:32,340
So Dana,
Dana told me this.

1978
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:35,970
Dana went down to albuquerque before 
this fight ever came together of her and

1979
01:23:35,971 --> 01:23:36,690
I.
Right.

1980
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,850
And he said,
look,

1981
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:41,670
you guys need to wait for Rhonda.
Trust me,

1982
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,530
that's the big money fight.
That's a fight.

1983
01:23:43,531 --> 01:23:44,790
You want to wait for him?
He went down there.

1984
01:23:44,791 --> 01:23:45,570
He told me this,
my face.

1985
01:23:45,571 --> 01:23:48,120
He went down there to tell them don't 
fight me.

1986
01:23:48,121 --> 01:23:49,980
Should take like they didn't want to 
give me.

1987
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,810
The UC did not want that fight to 
happen.

1988
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:57,170
They wanted the rematch should be the 
first fight and holly's manager told him

1989
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:03,680
we want me should tay.
And Dana said he threw up his hands and 

1990
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:03,680
was like,
are you fucking kidding me?

1991
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:03,690
He's like,
she's been the baddest,

1992
01:24:03,691 --> 01:24:05,760
you know other than Rhonda for years 
now,

1993
01:24:05,761 --> 01:24:10,761
and you want to take her lightly.
You think you're just going to walk 

1994
01:24:10,761 --> 01:24:10,761
there.
He's like,

1995
01:24:10,761 --> 01:24:10,761
yeah,
we got this.

1996
01:24:10,761 --> 01:24:12,390
Like she's going to be a tune up fight.
Who's her manager?

1997
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:14,420
I don't even know his name.
Okay,

1998
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:17,560
I know these idiot.
But then he told Dana that,

1999
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,070
that they,
that they thought that I was going to be

2000
01:24:20,071 --> 01:24:20,700
a tuneup,
fight.

2001
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:21,470
Well

2002
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,770
for get crazy.
People get crazy.

2003
01:24:23,771 --> 01:24:24,670
Look,
look right.

2004
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:26,650
As people go crazy too.
Everybody gets crazy.

2005
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:29,640
People get crazy.
Like why did Rhonda charge after?

2006
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:31,880
Why?
Why did she try to stand with,

2007
01:24:31,881 --> 01:24:34,650
with holly like that and charge after 
it?

2008
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:35,670
That's not the right attempt.

2009
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,360
Right.
But she did a page,

2010
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:44,270
so page was also at that VIP party and 
Paige and I have spoken with were 

2011
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:44,290
friendly,
don't know her that well,

2012
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:45,670
but anyway,
she felt the need.

2013
01:24:45,671 --> 01:24:46,750
She came up to shit,
Nisha,

2014
01:24:46,751 --> 01:24:47,320
Nisha.
She's like,

2015
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,530
I have to tell you this experience I had
with Rhonda and I'm like,

2016
01:24:50,531 --> 01:24:51,220
Oh,
what?

2017
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:56,400
And she's like,
well we're at a reebok deal just 

2018
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:56,400
recently.
And um,

2019
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:56,400
she,
she's like,

2020
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,420
we were at a shoot and she's like,
I was trying to find her so we could get

2021
01:24:58,421 --> 01:25:00,040
a picture and the reebok people were 
like,

2022
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,140
don't ask Rhonda for a picture.
And she's like,

2023
01:25:02,350 --> 01:25:04,030
why?
She's like,

2024
01:25:04,031 --> 01:25:06,100
just don't do,
just stay away from Rhonda.

2025
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,200
Don't ask her for a picture.
She's like,

2026
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:13,350
okay.
And I guess Rhonda came later that day 

2027
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:15,040
and like seek her out and there's like 
cussed her out.

2028
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:16,870
Like they've never really had a 
conversation either.

2029
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:18,040
She's like,
I don't know Rhonda,

2030
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:18,820
like,
you know,

2031
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,590
other than hi bye.
That's it.

2032
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:22,900
Like I guess she came up,
it came up,

2033
01:25:22,901 --> 01:25:24,370
I was like,
fuck you,

2034
01:25:24,371 --> 01:25:28,930
you fairweather bitch,
how dare you cross me ball washlet cross

2035
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:30,100
you,
what are you talking about?

2036
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:34,510
And she's like,
you congratulated Holly Holm for beating

2037
01:25:34,511 --> 01:25:35,670
me,
so fuck you,

2038
01:25:35,671 --> 01:25:38,590
you fucking fairweather 115 pounds.
I was just like,

2039
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:42,010
went off on page and page game he told 
me and I was like,

2040
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:43,150
honey,
welcome to my world.

2041
01:25:43,151 --> 01:25:43,890
She's like,
oh my God.

2042
01:25:43,891 --> 01:25:47,020
She's like,
I'm glad that I saw this side of her.

2043
01:25:47,021 --> 01:25:48,250
So I know,
you know,

2044
01:25:48,251 --> 01:25:48,850
I'm like,
well.

2045
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:50,230
And she's like,
you know,

2046
01:25:50,231 --> 01:25:51,190
because I didn't understand.
She's like,

2047
01:25:51,191 --> 01:25:56,191
I told Rhonda like,
I'm sorry if I offended you but you're 

2048
01:25:56,191 --> 01:25:56,191
not allowed to congratulate whoever I 
want.

2049
01:25:56,191 --> 01:25:58,180
And um,
she's like,

2050
01:25:58,181 --> 01:25:58,790
because,
you know,

2051
01:25:58,791 --> 01:26:00,330
I congratulate a rosen.
I'm a unit.

2052
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:01,270
When she beat me,
I was like,

2053
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:04,010
congratulations,
you whoop my ass was a bad

2054
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,780
ass performance.
And she's like,

2055
01:26:05,781 --> 01:26:07,340
you know,
I just simply told holly,

2056
01:26:07,341 --> 01:26:08,830
congratulations once again,
like,

2057
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,220
it wasn't anything,
you know,

2058
01:26:10,221 --> 01:26:15,221
anti Rhonda,
but Rhonda gets just ripped her nuon 

2059
01:26:15,221 --> 01:26:18,640
wow.
Like you have to be on team Rhonda for 

2060
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:18,640
life.
Yeah,

2061
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:22,480
I guess I've never been on team Rhonda,
some all or none.

2062
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:23,080
No,

2063
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:26,080
that was crazy.
I mean,

2064
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:31,860
people love both ways.
It's interesting like people love your 

2065
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,400
way,
but people also love like shit talking,

2066
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:38,420
you know,
people love Nate Diaz for that and 

2067
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:38,420
people love,
they love the drama,

2068
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:41,140
but they also love someone like you a 
hugger.

2069
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,170
I'm somewhere in the middle though 
because I get a lot of flack for

2070
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:45,970
no my mouth like,
so you just can't go.

2071
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I say what I'm thinking and I'm,
I'm pretty transparent and sometimes 

2072
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:51,430
people think that,
you know,

2073
01:26:51,431 --> 01:26:53,110
I get a lot of flack,
oh you're fake or this.

2074
01:26:53,111 --> 01:26:54,760
And I'm like,
not really like,

2075
01:26:54,761 --> 01:26:55,480
just because,
you know,

2076
01:26:55,481 --> 01:26:57,440
I'm like,
I'll say like I'm a fan of Connor,

2077
01:26:57,441 --> 01:27:00,160
I am.
I like his fighting style and his antics

2078
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:01,570
at first were kind of like,
wait,

2079
01:27:01,571 --> 01:27:02,530
who is this guy?
What is it?

2080
01:27:02,531 --> 01:27:03,640
You know?
And then I'm like,

2081
01:27:03,641 --> 01:27:05,260
man,
props to him.

2082
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:09,400
He's done amazing things like good for 
him and he's done really good things for

2083
01:27:09,401 --> 01:27:11,710
our sport.
But when you didn't show up to film that

2084
01:27:11,711 --> 01:27:13,500
commercial,
like I'm not,

2085
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:15,160
you know,
I'll be honest like yeah,

2086
01:27:15,161 --> 01:27:18,190
I kind of rubbed me the wrong way 
because people are like,

2087
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:20,230
oh,
he does so much more media than you guys

2088
01:27:20,231 --> 01:27:20,500
do.

2089
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:21,310
Yeah,
I'd probably does.

2090
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:22,300
You know,
they probably does.

2091
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,040
I do a lot.
He probably does more.

2092
01:27:24,130 --> 01:27:29,130
I agree.
But I don't have a private jet flying 

2093
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:29,830
out to pick me up and bring me back and 
fly 20 people in my crew with me too.

2094
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:34,890
He does more.
So he gets more when they bring them to 

2095
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:34,890
Vegas,
they put them up in a penthouse,

2096
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:35,230
you know,
they make sure he has everything that he

2097
01:27:35,231 --> 01:27:36,440
needs.
I don't get that,

2098
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:37,050
you know,
that I'm,

2099
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:38,170
that's fine.
You know,

2100
01:27:38,171 --> 01:27:39,790
he's earned that.
He's in that spot.

2101
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:45,090
No problem with that.
But I think three months out from a 

2102
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:45,090
fight camp,
you know,

2103
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:46,000
you have a private jet coming to pick 
you up with.

2104
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:51,120
You can bring one of your teammates.
You could probably work out on the jet 

2105
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:51,310
if you want to,
on the way there because it's yours,

2106
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:51,970
it's private.

2107
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:53,150
Do whatever you want.
Right.

2108
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,540
You could probably hit mental agenda.
You could totally,

2109
01:27:55,541 --> 01:27:55,900
you know,
I mean,

2110
01:27:55,901 --> 01:27:59,350
you're three months out and you don't 
want to show for your media obligations.

2111
01:27:59,351 --> 01:28:04,030
Like I don't really understand that.
I don't like it just,

2112
01:28:04,031 --> 01:28:05,470
I don't know.
I guess I'm trying to figure it out,

2113
01:28:05,471 --> 01:28:08,750
but the only issue that I had and it,
it doesn't bother me.

2114
01:28:08,751 --> 01:28:10,630
Like if he didn't want to do it,
that's his own thing.

2115
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:15,660
The thing is,
is that I showed up the day to film the 

2116
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:16,810
commercial and I had two segments I was 
supposed to film and that's all that was

2117
01:28:16,811 --> 01:28:18,300
on my schedule.
And then they asked me.

2118
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:24,250
They're like,
can you please help us out because 

2119
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:27,121
Connor's not here and uh,
we don't know what we're doing for this 

2120
01:28:27,121 --> 01:28:28,180
third segment of the commercial that was
supposed to be conor and nate.

2121
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:32,720
So can you please come back later that 
day and film that segment Muslim,

2122
01:28:32,860 --> 01:28:37,150
that was during my practice time.
So I had to come back and you know,

2123
01:28:37,151 --> 01:28:38,950
I did it.
So it was a company woman,

2124
01:28:38,951 --> 01:28:41,770
but like it was just frustrating because
it's like Dang,

2125
01:28:41,771 --> 01:28:42,880
you know,
if I had known about this,

2126
01:28:42,881 --> 01:28:44,650
I could have planned my training 
otherwise,

2127
01:28:44,651 --> 01:28:49,651
but now I kind of have to like scramble 
to get my second workout in and then it 

2128
01:28:49,651 --> 01:28:49,651
affected me.
So yeah,

2129
01:28:49,651 --> 01:28:51,280
his decision did.
And it probably is actually,

2130
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:56,600
you know,
I haven't made any more money in the 

2131
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:56,600
sport yet because of Connor.
A lot of people like to like,

2132
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,881
oh,
you must have got a bigger payday 

2133
01:28:59,881 --> 01:28:59,881
because I last,
I'm like,

2134
01:28:59,881 --> 01:29:02,041
no,
because I wasn't the champion so I 

2135
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:02,041
didn't get any more of like get any 
paper views.

2136
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:04,350
I get any more money and now he's like 
not on this fight card.

2137
01:29:04,351 --> 01:29:05,910
So I'm like,
you know,

2138
01:29:05,911 --> 01:29:06,840
but it's whatever,
you know,

2139
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,690
it's,
it's connors deal and uh,

2140
01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:10,200
I,
I don't hate connor,

2141
01:29:10,201 --> 01:29:12,900
but I'm going to say how I feel,
you know?

2142
01:29:12,901 --> 01:29:14,250
And I would say it if he was sitting 
here too.

2143
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:14,760
I'm like,
dude,

2144
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:16,920
why did you do that?
You probably,

2145
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:22,640
I feel like there's a bunch of issues 
here and we are the only way to really 

2146
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:27,051
get a firm understanding of it is to sit
down with everyone involved and say what

2147
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:30,210
was communicated your manager?
Did he know what the,

2148
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:33,000
what the appearance schedule was going 
to be like?

2149
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:35,310
Did you guys agree to this?
Did you understand what you were getting

2150
01:29:35,311 --> 01:29:37,260
into when you were fighting?
Maybe it's a misunderstanding,

2151
01:29:37,261 --> 01:29:38,340
you know,
who knows?

2152
01:29:38,370 --> 01:29:43,370
It's hard to say,
but it's the way he went about it was 

2153
01:29:43,370 --> 01:29:43,660
ridiculous.
Like saying I'm retired,

2154
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,840
thanks for the cheese.
And then saying I'm not retired.

2155
01:29:45,841 --> 01:29:50,080
And then saying I'm glad the UFC decided
to give the fans what they want and be,

2156
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,680
I'm going to be on UFC 200 numbers.
Like what?

2157
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:57,810
And so like what he's doing is he's kind
of like using the media to try to get 

2158
01:29:59,611 --> 01:30:04,611
this thing to pass through,
but he doesn't understand Dana and 

2159
01:30:04,611 --> 01:30:07,250
Lorenzo and frank,
like that's never going to work.

2160
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:11,830
Like you're,
you're either in or you're not in like.

2161
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:14,730
And they're like real clear about that.
They have to set a precedent.

2162
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:19,760
So like if you say fuck you,
I'm not doing media that kind of go oh 

2163
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:19,760
well okay fuck you,
you're not fighting,

2164
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,070
but hold on,
I'm conor mcgregor where the UFC,

2165
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:24,450
this is what it is.

2166
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:26,890
My name is Doris,
don't make many more

2167
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,730
and we might lose millions of dollars 
because you're not on UFC 200.

2168
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:31,590
Yeah,
well he,

2169
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:32,620
he,
he had put,

2170
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:37,830
they put 10 million ended up promoting 
this Saturday 10 million and he's like 

2171
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:37,830
we're way over budget,
you know.

2172
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:42,031
So that's why I was like you've got to 
show up and do you know that's how 

2173
01:30:42,031 --> 01:30:45,661
connor was made is through that stuff.
So now like at what point do you get to 

2174
01:30:45,661 --> 01:30:47,080
decide that you don't have to do that 
anymore?

2175
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:49,630
Like if that's what made you who you are
like I mean don't,

2176
01:30:49,631 --> 01:30:52,750
you kind of have to like,
does that make sense what I'm saying?

2177
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:56,930
I mean at what point do you get to 
decide like when you don't have to like,

2178
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:59,380
like I use the machine and now like I 
don't,

2179
01:30:59,381 --> 01:31:01,030
I just want to hop off now that I'm 
here.

2180
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:06,570
I don't know.
Do you kind of have to keep it the same 

2181
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:06,570
boys?

2182
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:08,230
I think so,
but there is also like a fine line,

2183
01:31:08,231 --> 01:31:09,460
right?
Like you can do too much.

2184
01:31:09,461 --> 01:31:14,461
Like when I was watching the Jose Aldo 
media tour when they were going all 

2185
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:14,470
around the world,
I'm like,

2186
01:31:14,471 --> 01:31:19,471
okay,
I understand that you want to promote 

2187
01:31:19,471 --> 01:31:19,471
this fight.
Yeah,

2188
01:31:19,471 --> 01:31:22,780
but how much of this is helping the 
actual fight itself and then how much of

2189
01:31:22,781 --> 01:31:27,781
it is just conor mcgregor constantly 
talking Shit at press conferences and 

2190
01:31:27,781 --> 01:31:31,141
grabbing the belt and all that.
That mean that's really kind of selling 

2191
01:31:31,141 --> 01:31:31,141
the fight.
Was that.

2192
01:31:31,510 --> 01:31:33,130
I don't know.
They did a lot of it,

2193
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:36,190
but apparently connor was sick.
Like he was like,

2194
01:31:36,191 --> 01:31:39,280
I'm just constantly fighting off a cold 
is really hard to get in shape.

2195
01:31:39,281 --> 01:31:44,281
Really hard to train because every week 
you know you're traveling from here to 

2196
01:31:44,281 --> 01:31:48,001
there and they already here.
It's just you're constantly getting 

2197
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:48,001
beaten down and you know what it's like 
if I give you ever.

2198
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:49,690
Have you ever flown into Brazil and 
fought?

2199
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:52,150
No.
I fall in there for fight cards though.

2200
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:55,120
What is the furthest you've ever had a 
flight of fight?

2201
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:56,710
Japan?
Japan.

2202
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:59,050
So that's an interesting one because 
it's a long flight,

2203
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,250
like 16 hours,
right?

2204
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:01,520
What is it like?
Like,

2205
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:06,080
like adjusting and then competing?
I try to

2206
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:11,420
started adjusting my schedule at home,
like black and white windows a little 

2207
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:11,420
bit or you know,
like to,

2208
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:13,230
to make the timeframe but you'd never 
get fully adjusted.

2209
01:32:13,231 --> 01:32:14,800
But the,
my mind frame is like when,

2210
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:16,950
when push comes to shove,
when fight time comes,

2211
01:32:16,951 --> 01:32:19,510
whether it's two in the morning,
my time or not like I'm going to be game

2212
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:22,500
so I would just look at it that way but 
it's not fun.

2213
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:26,430
Like I remember three weeks out from my 
fight with Retina Chi,

2214
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:31,490
which I didn't even want to.
I didn't want to do that fight because 

2215
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:31,490
she was so unknown.
She was undefeated.

2216
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:35,490
I'm going over there to fight on a newly
blooming fight pass and I was like,

2217
01:32:36,030 --> 01:32:37,980
this is like,
feels like it does nothing for me.

2218
01:32:37,981 --> 01:32:39,930
And like if she wins it,
springboards her,

2219
01:32:39,931 --> 01:32:44,931
you know,
then she'll be 17 and no shove a judo 

2220
01:32:44,931 --> 01:32:44,931
background.

2221
01:32:44,931 --> 01:32:44,931
They're going to want to make that fight
for,

2222
01:32:44,931 --> 01:32:49,290
for her and Rhonda.
I know that's what they're trying to do 

2223
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:49,290
is they're trying to use,
you know,

2224
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:50,850
business use me as that springboard.
It's like I don't really want to use but

2225
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:56,240
I did it but three weeks before the 
fight they had me fly to Japan to do 

2226
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,950
some promotional stuff and I was flying 
longer than I was even on the ground and

2227
01:32:58,951 --> 01:33:02,100
they said like ticket sales went up and 
everything was really good.

2228
01:33:02,101 --> 01:33:03,960
But yeah,
that was exhausting.

2229
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:05,340
So I do,
I understand that before.

2230
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:06,690
Yeah,
that's hard.

2231
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:09,150
Really hard.
Really hard.

2232
01:33:09,151 --> 01:33:14,151
Ramping it up three weeks in super hard 
and after my fight with holly I got to 

2233
01:33:14,161 --> 01:33:19,161
spend a little time in Australia and 
then I went straight from Australia to 

2234
01:33:19,161 --> 01:33:19,161
New York.
Spent a day there,

2235
01:33:19,161 --> 01:33:22,710
did a full day of media,
went to Connecticut to espn,

2236
01:33:22,711 --> 01:33:24,210
did a full day of media,
what to Toronto,

2237
01:33:24,211 --> 01:33:29,211
did a full day media and it's just like,
it's non stop from like you start your 

2238
01:33:29,881 --> 01:33:32,940
first interview at eight in the morning 
so you have to pick up at like seven and

2239
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:37,941
you go until seven at night and even 
while you're driving to the next place 

2240
01:33:37,951 --> 01:33:39,120
they'll have you on the phone.

2241
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,820
Was with the,
with the,

2242
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:41,660
with uh,
you know,

2243
01:33:41,730 --> 01:33:43,200
with a radio interview,
you know,

2244
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:45,200
I mean there's no break.
It's all,

2245
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,920
it's,
it's pretty intense.

2246
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,900
It's pretty crazy.
It's pretty exhausting.

2247
01:33:48,901 --> 01:33:51,750
So I get it.
I've been in those shoes before.

2248
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,790
But um,
you know,

2249
01:33:53,791 --> 01:33:54,780
it's,
I don't know,

2250
01:33:54,781 --> 01:33:57,150
maybe there's more extended research.
Maybe he was hurt or something.

2251
01:33:57,151 --> 01:33:59,850
Maybe you didn't want people to see like
maybe I don't know,

2252
01:33:59,851 --> 01:34:01,350
like what if there's even something like
that.

2253
01:34:01,351 --> 01:34:06,351
Like what if he had hurt himself or 
something and he didn't want nate to 

2254
01:34:06,351 --> 01:34:06,351
know.

2255
01:34:06,351 --> 01:34:06,450
Yeah.
Who knows?

2256
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,680
I don't know.
Who knows?

2257
01:34:07,681 --> 01:34:12,681
And it's also,
he also had to realize there was a lot 

2258
01:34:12,681 --> 01:34:12,681
of work that needed to be done to beat 
nate.

2259
01:34:12,681 --> 01:34:14,730
Yeah.
Like he's hitting eight with some of his

2260
01:34:14,731 --> 01:34:18,870
best shots and nate was fine with it and
it was a real problem.

2261
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:24,380
That's more what it was,
is that he was just obsessed with 

2262
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:24,380
beating nay and I,
I get that too.

2263
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:25,380
I don't take that away from him for a 
minute.

2264
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:30,410
Like he wanted to stay home and.
Or he was in Iceland I guess training 

2265
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:30,780
and he wants to train to be nate.
I get it.

2266
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:32,040
Totally get it.

2267
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:32,930
Yeah,
I get it too.

2268
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:36,200
It seems like the only way also I felt 
like.

2269
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:37,880
But then again he could have brought us 
whole gym with him,

2270
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:38,810
you know?
Sure.

2271
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:44,170
We could have tried.
I mean it was going to be a difficult 

2272
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:46,550
time just trying to find the moments to 
train and to stay in shape.

2273
01:34:46,551 --> 01:34:49,500
And then obviously being exhausted from 
flying and all that jazz

2274
01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:52,330
turnaround too.
You know,

2275
01:34:52,331 --> 01:34:54,370
like as far as.
Well I don't think he was supposed to be

2276
01:34:54,371 --> 01:34:56,080
there more than like two days.
I

2277
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,980
honestly think he's better off not doing

2278
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,980
it.
I honestly think he's better off like 

2279
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:04,940
sequestering himself for a few months,
like really focusing on what went wrong,

2280
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:07,520
how to correct it and can you correct 
it?

2281
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:12,730
I mean,
do you like when it comes to the ground 

2282
01:35:12,730 --> 01:35:13,010
game,
what I saw on the ground,

2283
01:35:13,011 --> 01:35:13,730
I was like,
boy,

2284
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,130
this is a long road.
Like you've got a long road to beat.

2285
01:35:16,131 --> 01:35:20,240
A guy like nate,
he's so much further along in,

2286
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,900
in and ground and pound Jujitsu,
positioning everything.

2287
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:26,780
When I was watching nate beat them up on
the ground and choke him,

2288
01:35:26,781 --> 01:35:27,410
I was like,
whoa.

2289
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:33,190
That happened quick.
This is not like Weidman and rockhold 

2290
01:35:33,190 --> 01:35:37,070
was a prolonged beating before rockhold 
eventually stopped him the next round.

2291
01:35:37,071 --> 01:35:41,060
Yeah,
but with why with nate and connor wasn't

2292
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:46,150
that prolonged.
It happened pretty quickly and when you 

2293
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:46,150
see that you go,
Ooh,

2294
01:35:46,150 --> 01:35:48,830
this is going to be.
There's a lot to overcome.

2295
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:52,360
It's not unsurmountable takes.
A lot of times the skill sets,

2296
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:53,750
they don't just.
They don't come overnight.

2297
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:56,240
You don't.
He can pick up your cardio pretty quick.

2298
01:35:56,241 --> 01:35:57,650
You can do a lot of things.
You can't,

2299
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:03,100
you can't build a skill set any faster 
than it's going to go through your 

2300
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:05,920
muscle memory and being Rep.
you've got to put thousands of reps in 

2301
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:06,830
and there's no way around it.
There's no way.

2302
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:08,330
There's no way to fast forward through 
that.

2303
01:36:08,331 --> 01:36:11,120
There's no way to cut the corner.
There's no right.

2304
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:12,980
You can't just repetition,
repetition,

2305
01:36:12,981 --> 01:36:17,981
repetition would also.
It highlights all the various eccentric 

2306
01:36:17,981 --> 01:36:19,460
aspects of your training that people are
like,

2307
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:21,140
hmm,
is this what makes connor great?

2308
01:36:21,550 --> 01:36:22,250
And you know,
and then,

2309
01:36:22,251 --> 01:36:23,690
you know,
nate calling it touch button,

2310
01:36:23,691 --> 01:36:25,130
the park,
like the dude,

2311
01:36:25,150 --> 01:36:29,300
all these cartwheels and stuff.
Then video is so funny.

2312
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:30,950
Hilarious.
Oh my God.

2313
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:32,990
I was dying laughing.
Clarius.

2314
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:38,320
So when this all,
you know he's doing all these work with 

2315
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:42,851
this movement guy,
but then you see what happens when it 

2316
01:36:42,851 --> 01:36:44,870
actually comes to fighting skills and 
you go,

2317
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:49,990
oh,
maybe this is not the way to do it 

2318
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:52,990
because like I've talked to a lot of 
people that were like this stuff that 

2319
01:36:52,990 --> 01:36:55,010
he's doing his utter horse shit like 
this.

2320
01:36:55,130 --> 01:36:57,560
Doing cartwheels and being obsessed with
movement.

2321
01:36:57,740 --> 01:36:59,330
Here's the movements you need to be 
worried about.

2322
01:36:59,331 --> 01:37:00,830
Okay.
Moving your feet,

2323
01:37:00,831 --> 01:37:05,831
throwing kicks and punches.
Take down defense and Jujitsu on the 

2324
01:37:05,831 --> 01:37:05,831
ground.
That's it.

2325
01:37:05,870 --> 01:37:07,610
You know,
understanding takedowns yourself,

2326
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,890
taking people down if you must,
trip sweeps,

2327
01:37:09,891 --> 01:37:14,891
all that stuff.
But all this cart wheels and what this 

2328
01:37:14,891 --> 01:37:18,380
guy was explaining to me,
and I want to name any names because 

2329
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:18,380
they're prominent guy.
He was like,

2330
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:22,390
you have to understand that there's a 
limited amount of energy you have in 

2331
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:26,051
your time training and you are not 
perfect at all of these other aspects of

2332
01:37:26,721 --> 01:37:27,200
mma.

2333
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:29,510
So if you are not perfect all these 
other aspects of,

2334
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:30,680
uh,
may you have to say,

2335
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:31,850
okay,
how much.

2336
01:37:31,851 --> 01:37:36,851
Yeah,
how much of this stuff is going to help 

2337
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:36,851
me?
Will a guy like George St Pierre,

2338
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:38,840
he looked at gymnastics and he was like,
you know what's going to help me because

2339
01:37:38,841 --> 01:37:42,530
I can be stronger physically and there's
no better way.

2340
01:37:42,531 --> 01:37:46,220
I think like as far as like manipulating
your body than gymnastics,

2341
01:37:46,221 --> 01:37:49,030
like doing the rings and developing a 
perception.

2342
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:54,110
Yeah,
you're learning how to manipulate your 

2343
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:56,201
body and all kinds of contorted 
positions being upside down and 

2344
01:37:56,201 --> 01:37:56,201
understanding where you are

2345
01:37:56,201 --> 01:37:59,280
when you're upside down and where you're
going to be with the momentum you have.

2346
01:37:59,281 --> 01:38:04,281
You have to calculate that your mouth is
doing constant algorithms and math 

2347
01:38:04,281 --> 01:38:07,260
equations essentially when you're 
fighting to weight distribution where we

2348
01:38:07,261 --> 01:38:12,261
are,
especially when you tie up with someone 

2349
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:13,701
else and you have to feel their way and 
you have to manipulate it in a way to 

2350
01:38:13,701 --> 01:38:14,460
get it where you want,
whether it's against the cage or whether

2351
01:38:14,461 --> 01:38:18,390
it's on the ground,
your body is using a equation.

2352
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:24,250
You know your mind is equating,
how much force do I need to make this 

2353
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:25,050
happen?
How little forest?

2354
01:38:25,051 --> 01:38:27,600
Like what if I go the opposite direction
because they're pushing into me.

2355
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:30,960
There's all these different things that 
you have to over.

2356
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:36,050
There's no other way to do it.
Then then a trial and error process and 

2357
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:36,050
over and over and over and over again.

2358
01:38:36,530 --> 01:38:41,530
Yeah,
and you look at someone who's like 

2359
01:38:41,530 --> 01:38:42,790
really good at one aspect of MMA,
like Yoel Romero who is just a 

2360
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:44,270
ridiculous wrestler,
and you go,

2361
01:38:44,271 --> 01:38:46,040
okay,
look how much touch button the park.

2362
01:38:46,041 --> 01:38:49,640
Is that guy doing cartwheels?
Is he doing?

2363
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:50,540
Is he tumbling?

2364
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:55,840
No,
but I bet you he does 100 double eggs a 

2365
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:55,910
day at least.
Well,

2366
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,790
he's doing all kinds of legs and then 
100 body locks.

2367
01:38:58,800 --> 01:38:59,420
Then,
you know,

2368
01:39:00,370 --> 01:39:01,870
connor lost.
Everybody's like,

2369
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:03,880
this is what we need.
We need a movement coach.

2370
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:05,170
I need to move in,
coach,

2371
01:39:05,260 --> 01:39:06,900
you know,
and it still might.

2372
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:07,390
I mean as

2373
01:39:07,730 --> 01:39:11,480
George St Pierre,
it has massive benefits to get that kind

2374
01:39:11,481 --> 01:39:12,860
of coordination.
Physical strength.

2375
01:39:12,861 --> 01:39:15,610
Do you like about connor though?
Is like um,

2376
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:20,620
his balance is impeccable and that could
be part of that and like he is never 

2377
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:23,740
over himself,
at least with the striking part of it in

2378
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:25,820
the ground is a completely different 
thing.

2379
01:39:25,821 --> 01:39:28,850
But when he's in striking range and it's
just his body,

2380
01:39:28,851 --> 01:39:33,080
his eye hand coordination is incredible.
And his balance,

2381
01:39:33,081 --> 01:39:36,440
like he's never too far over a punch.
He's never too far back.

2382
01:39:36,441 --> 01:39:39,080
He's always centered,
he's always centered,

2383
01:39:39,081 --> 01:39:40,700
he throws a kick,
he never gets,

2384
01:39:40,701 --> 01:39:45,701
you know,
you see people kick and they miss and 

2385
01:39:45,701 --> 01:39:45,701
they kinda like stumbled like their 
weights off balance or,

2386
01:39:45,701 --> 01:39:49,720
or they kick and even land and even when
they put their foot down it's kind of 

2387
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:49,720
like,
it's not a good landing,

2388
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:53,561
you know,
like I'm not like the world's best 

2389
01:39:53,561 --> 01:39:53,561
kicker,
but when I watched conor do it,

2390
01:39:53,561 --> 01:39:55,820
it's like he kicks or push kicks and 
sticks it.

2391
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:57,440
He is like a,
like a,

2392
01:39:57,610 --> 01:39:58,980
a gymnast in the sense,
you know,

2393
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:00,950
the flip and then they want to just 
boom,

2394
01:40:00,951 --> 01:40:03,500
stick it like.
And he's really,

2395
01:40:03,501 --> 01:40:08,501
really good at that sense.
Maybe that's where the movement does 

2396
01:40:08,501 --> 01:40:08,501
benefit.
I think.

2397
01:40:08,501 --> 01:40:10,790
So then he never is over himself in his 
weight distribution but isn't the case

2398
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:15,940
whenever someone loses though,
everyone always second guess is what 

2399
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:17,360
they were doing.
Even if what they were doing was getting

2400
01:40:17,361 --> 01:40:20,480
them to be like 16 and no,
totally undefeated world champion.

2401
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:25,960
When you'd make a mistake or something 
goes wrong or something goes right for 

2402
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:30,431
your opponent,
we should probably say immediately 

2403
01:40:30,431 --> 01:40:30,431
people start questioning everything you 
did.

2404
01:40:30,431 --> 01:40:31,480
Yeah,
definitely all the time.

2405
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,620
I mean it happened with me when,
you know,

2406
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:35,330
when I lost to Toronto,
that guy,

2407
01:40:35,331 --> 01:40:36,830
you got to change this,
you gotta change everything,

2408
01:40:36,831 --> 01:40:38,000
but as long as you're winning people 
like,

2409
01:40:38,001 --> 01:40:43,001
yeah,
keep doing what you're doing and it's 

2410
01:40:43,001 --> 01:40:43,001
working,
and then he loses it,

2411
01:40:43,001 --> 01:40:43,430
like change everything.
It's like,

2412
01:40:43,431 --> 01:40:44,840
Jeez,
that was quick.

2413
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:50,310
Well,
that's also the Rhonda criticism in the 

2414
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:50,310
Holly Holm fight.
Everybody was like looking at her like a

2415
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:52,420
dominating Betco.
Heyo would stand up,

2416
01:40:52,690 --> 01:40:54,040
you know,
I'm beating

2417
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:59,040
Sarah Mcmahon and the way she did Alexis
Davis beating her down the way she did 

2418
01:40:59,040 --> 01:40:59,040
and go,
we'll look.

2419
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,240
Rhonda obviously is getting so good at 
striking,

2420
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:06,250
so just such an elite athlete that she 
can do what she's doing to anybody and 

2421
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:10,711
then her trainer saying that she could 
go box women professionals and knock 

2422
01:41:10,711 --> 01:41:14,281
them out and so you get this thing in 
your head that you can do what you have 

2423
01:41:14,281 --> 01:41:16,990
been doing and then you fight someone 
like holly and you go,

2424
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:17,500
Oh,
well,

2425
01:41:17,501 --> 01:41:19,480
okay.
Yeah,

2426
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:21,790
there's a leather sole.
There's so many levels.

2427
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:26,990
I mean,
it's one of the more fascinating things 

2428
01:41:26,990 --> 01:41:26,990
about martial arts is that there are so 
many levels.

2429
01:41:26,990 --> 01:41:27,880
Yeah.
And there's never.

2430
01:41:27,881 --> 01:41:32,290
It's never ending.
Never ending story really is,

2431
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:33,350
right?
Yeah.

2432
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:38,660
Is this a song that I ever just goes on?
Yeah.

2433
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:40,360
Um,
no,

2434
01:41:40,361 --> 01:41:41,500
it's,
it's literally,

2435
01:41:41,501 --> 01:41:45,190
it's you never injected when you think 
you have it all figured out.

2436
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:47,050
Boom.
There goes the curve ball.

2437
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:49,100
I think that's what's addicting about 
this sport though.

2438
01:41:49,101 --> 01:41:50,990
Like it's safe to say it's like a drug.
It's,

2439
01:41:50,991 --> 01:41:54,370
it's addicting.
I think adversity in some weird way.

2440
01:41:54,371 --> 01:41:59,371
I'm definitely addicted to that.
I like it when things seem 

2441
01:41:59,371 --> 01:42:02,470
insurmountable or their look too hard or
other people don't believe that I can do

2442
01:42:02,471 --> 01:42:02,680
it.

2443
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:06,130
That's such a weird quality because most
people have the opposite.

2444
01:42:06,131 --> 01:42:08,260
Most people are like,
I like it when I know I can take a nap.

2445
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:11,140
I liked it.
I like it when that couch looks soft and

2446
01:42:11,141 --> 01:42:12,910
I'm gonna walk over there and plop 
myself down.

2447
01:42:12,911 --> 01:42:14,560
I'll let you know.
And you're like,

2448
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:16,810
I'm going to run up that fucking 
mountain with no air.

2449
01:42:17,870 --> 01:42:20,980
See how I see how long I could go before
I pass out.

2450
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:23,350
Weird quality.

2451
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,520
Yeah.
Um,

2452
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:25,740
I don't know.
It is weird,

2453
01:42:25,741 --> 01:42:28,980
but I like it.
I Dunno like that about myself because I

2454
01:42:28,981 --> 01:42:31,410
know anytime I ever get into a hard 
situation about,

2455
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:33,810
about anything,
it's like I can get through it.

2456
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:34,950
I've,
I've seen worse,

2457
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:35,840
you know.

2458
01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:38,770
Well you definitely have proven that.
There's no doubt about it.

2459
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:43,800
You know,
and you've proven it inside the octagon 

2460
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:44,080
just leading up to this fight.
Obviously he proved it in this fight,

2461
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:45,400
but you proved it leading up to this 
fight.

2462
01:42:45,401 --> 01:42:50,401
Like the Sara Mcmann fight I think was 
one of your most impressive fights 

2463
01:42:50,401 --> 01:42:53,670
because you got her down and you were me
and she's a fucking silver medalist in 

2464
01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:55,690
the Olympics and you were dominating the
top position.

2465
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,860
You out scrambled or you stayed on top 
of her and beat her down and I was like,

2466
01:42:59,861 --> 01:43:01,660
that is it does it.
Big victory.

2467
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:03,610
Heavy top game.
You do.

2468
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,190
We should grapple sometime.
Okay.

2469
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:09,130
Well I'm scared now.
Girls say we should grapple sometimes.

2470
01:43:09,790 --> 01:43:11,020
Yeah.
But always gets odd.

2471
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:13,270
Weird,
quick.

2472
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,460
No,
I'm sure you do.

2473
01:43:15,461 --> 01:43:15,750
I'm sure,
yeah,

2474
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:21,350
but um,
it comes to wrestling and I think just 

2475
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:21,690
experience and knowing,
you know,

2476
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:27,800
wrestling can translate.
A lot of sports can translate well into 

2477
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:27,800
two mix.
Marsha,

2478
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,610
I happen to think wrestling is one of 
the best translations,

2479
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:34,670
you know,
as opposed to like someone typically 

2480
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:35,490
boxers coming into the sport don't 
typically transition as well.

2481
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:36,420
Kickboxers,
you know,

2482
01:43:36,421 --> 01:43:41,421
because they have so much more to learn.
I feel like the fundamentals of 

2483
01:43:41,421 --> 01:43:41,421
wrestling kind of the,
they,

2484
01:43:41,421 --> 01:43:46,030
they encompass a lot of what you need in
mma and if you are the better wrestler 

2485
01:43:46,030 --> 01:43:46,600
you can decide do I want to stay on the 
feeder?

2486
01:43:46,601 --> 01:43:49,320
I want to take it to the ground.
It dictates what dictates.

2487
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,720
So with that said,
um,

2488
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:56,980
I think I learned how to use the pieces 
that work for wrestling and MMA and take

2489
01:43:57,471 --> 01:44:02,471
out the ones that don't because there's 
a lot of stuff in the wrestling or any 

2490
01:44:02,471 --> 01:44:05,351
other sport that you're going to bring 
over the doesn't work from because I'm 

2491
01:44:05,351 --> 01:44:07,510
amazed the sport of its own.
And I think maybe like Mcmahon Ha,

2492
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:12,610
like she's such an elite level wrestler 
that she's so ingrained with just 

2493
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:12,710
wrestle,
wrestle,

2494
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:17,711
wrestle,
wrestle that it's hard sometimes with 

2495
01:44:17,711 --> 01:44:18,890
the more elite you are at something to 
like water it down again,

2496
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:24,130
essentially.
That's kind of what you have to do that 

2497
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:24,130
you have to take pieces out for mixed 
martial arts.

2498
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:25,160
There's some things that you don't want 
to do because Oh,

2499
01:44:25,161 --> 01:44:26,480
you got choked.
If you do that,

2500
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:28,250
you know,
like when you're in wrestling,

2501
01:44:28,251 --> 01:44:29,550
the last thing you want to do is be on 
your back.

2502
01:44:29,551 --> 01:44:32,030
So you turn over you and you arch out,
you lift your neck.

2503
01:44:32,031 --> 01:44:32,930
It's like,
Oh man,

2504
01:44:32,931 --> 01:44:37,931
if you try to do that,
you try to stand up the way that you 

2505
01:44:37,931 --> 01:44:37,931
wouldn't.
A wrestling match,

2506
01:44:37,931 --> 01:44:37,931
you're going to get choked,
can't do that.

2507
01:44:37,931 --> 01:44:39,140
You've got to keep your Chin tucked and 
then you've got to hand fight.

2508
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,780
So there's things that you have to 
relearn.

2509
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:45,110
And I think when you're such an elite 
elitist at something,

2510
01:44:45,111 --> 01:44:46,760
sometimes it's hard to relearn those.

2511
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:49,910
That's very good point.
And I think you could also use that same

2512
01:44:49,911 --> 01:44:54,911
point where you're talking about 
strikers learning takedown defense and 

2513
01:44:54,911 --> 01:44:57,050
that like a lot of strikers like to 
stand up really straight and you know,

2514
01:44:57,051 --> 01:44:59,870
as soon as they get involved in 
exchanges with people,

2515
01:44:59,871 --> 01:45:04,871
they fall into their old striking ways.
And that's when a got like George St 

2516
01:45:04,871 --> 01:45:06,140
Pierre who was so good at being 
unpredictable.

2517
01:45:06,141 --> 01:45:08,460
Like you never knew if he was going to 
take you down if he's going to stand for

2518
01:45:08,510 --> 01:45:13,510
one of the most flawless fighters.
When you say as far as like a game by 

2519
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:14,750
sticking a game plan and being 
disciplined and we're getting emotional.

2520
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:16,280
Never getting away from the game plan.

2521
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:21,480
Well in his prime,
you look at during his run and no one 

2522
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,630
keeps her run up forever.
But during his run,

2523
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:27,930
I mean he beat everybody.
They put in front of him and he fought 

2524
01:45:27,930 --> 01:45:30,670
in some incredible fights where he 
fought some really,

2525
01:45:30,671 --> 01:45:35,671
really dangerous difficult guys and 
manage his way through the water to 

2526
01:45:35,671 --> 01:45:38,971
victory.
And that's all you could ever expect 

2527
01:45:38,971 --> 01:45:38,971
from a champion.
And people will say like,

2528
01:45:38,971 --> 01:45:39,460
oh well here's some of the sites were 
boring,

2529
01:45:39,461 --> 01:45:41,860
or he played safety first.
Like Jesus Christ,

2530
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:46,980
he fought the killers of the killers and
he had five rounds and in during those 

2531
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:47,740
five rounds,
you know,

2532
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,230
Carlos Condit head kicks him and drops 
him.

2533
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:52,570
Matt Serra knocked him out and won the 
title.

2534
01:45:52,690 --> 01:45:56,530
He's had adversity like,
but he beat everybody.

2535
01:45:56,990 --> 01:46:01,990
You can't ask for more.
Like what do you think would happen if 

2536
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:05,491
he just,
there's this mentality that some fans 

2537
01:46:05,491 --> 01:46:08,131
want where they want a guy who wants a 
bite down his mouthpiece and just swing 

2538
01:46:08,131 --> 01:46:09,760
away and like come on seven and hope for
the best.

2539
01:46:09,820 --> 01:46:14,820
That's so retarded.
Like that's not what martial arts are 

2540
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:14,820
about.

2541
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:18,010
Not One hundred percent people.
People sometimes tend to enjoy the 

2542
01:46:18,161 --> 01:46:20,800
excitement of amateur fights more 
because they're more chaotic.

2543
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:22,030
Like people don't know what they're 
doing.

2544
01:46:22,031 --> 01:46:27,031
So it's just like stick to two people in
there that Kinda know how to throw 

2545
01:46:27,031 --> 01:46:30,391
punches and maybe Kinda know how to 
wrestle and they just go balls to the 

2546
01:46:30,391 --> 01:46:33,241
wall because that's like,
that's all that they know that they're 

2547
01:46:33,241 --> 01:46:33,241
confident in.
Just go as hard as you can.

2548
01:46:33,241 --> 01:46:38,040
It's also like a really good debate 
between two very articulate and very 

2549
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:42,911
intelligent people.
No one is going to get the real upper 

2550
01:46:42,911 --> 01:46:45,461
hand real quick.
There's gonna be points and 

2551
01:46:45,461 --> 01:46:45,620
counterpoints is going to go back and 
forth.

2552
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,690
Both guys going to be very well 
prepared.

2553
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:49,410
Both women are going to be very well 
prepared.

2554
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:53,850
You're not going to get like a very 
clear winner right away unless something

2555
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:56,030
crazy happens.
Like Aldo in Mcgregor,

2556
01:46:56,370 --> 01:47:01,370
like all those just so mad at Mcgregor 
from all this fucking shit talking he's 

2557
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:04,851
been doing for months and months and 
months that he just runs at them and 

2558
01:47:04,851 --> 01:47:06,960
gets clipped crazy.
For a guy like Aldo,

2559
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:12,110
that's gotta be maddening.
You hold the title for nine fucking 

2560
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:12,840
years or however long you held it.

2561
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:15,140
I think it was in second.
Oh my God.

2562
01:47:15,141 --> 01:47:16,820
I mean any scene,
although do that.

2563
01:47:16,821 --> 01:47:18,450
He was so emotionally charged.
Yeah.

2564
01:47:18,451 --> 01:47:23,451
He was very upset and that just goes to 
show how much the mind is a powerful 

2565
01:47:23,661 --> 01:47:24,170
thing.
It's like if you.

2566
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:27,650
If if you,
if you think you can or think you can't,

2567
01:47:27,651 --> 01:47:28,790
you're right.
Either way,

2568
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:31,130
it's,
it's really derived from your,

2569
01:47:31,131 --> 01:47:32,180
your mind,
you know,

2570
01:47:32,181 --> 01:47:37,181
and,
and you can have all the skills in the 

2571
01:47:37,181 --> 01:47:37,181
world if you don't believe you can do it
or,

2572
01:47:37,181 --> 01:47:41,470
or whatever.
You don't have the confidence in your 

2573
01:47:41,470 --> 01:47:41,470
mind,
you won't just interesting.

2574
01:47:41,470 --> 01:47:43,090
Or if someone puts a seed in there and 
like,

2575
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,510
like,
like connor,

2576
01:47:44,511 --> 01:47:47,580
I just think that he was so good at the 
mental warfare and you know,

2577
01:47:47,650 --> 01:47:49,600
Josie never had to deal with that.
Never.

2578
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:51,060
That was the thing.
It was like

2579
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:53,620
he was all respect.
Everyone that he fought,

2580
01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:55,420
shook his hand,
respected him.

2581
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:57,730
I realized he's this killer.
I mean,

2582
01:47:57,731 --> 01:48:02,731
and he was the reigning featherweight 
champion for as long as there was a 

2583
01:48:02,731 --> 01:48:03,520
featherweight champion.
He was the first,

2584
01:48:03,521 --> 01:48:08,521
the original.
He held that title for longer than 

2585
01:48:08,521 --> 01:48:09,880
anybody and was flawless.
I mean he had some amazing fights,

2586
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:12,790
but he started this show,
like some chinks in his armor or towards

2587
01:48:12,791 --> 01:48:17,791
the end,
like the second fight that he had with 

2588
01:48:17,791 --> 01:48:20,971
Chad Mendez.
Like it's shit like that was a real war 

2589
01:48:20,971 --> 01:48:21,130
and real grueling fight.
Whereas,

2590
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:22,810
you know,
the first fight with Mendez,

2591
01:48:22,811 --> 01:48:27,811
he just looks insane.
It looked tremendous and stop Mendez 

2592
01:48:27,811 --> 01:48:27,811
quick,

2593
01:48:27,811 --> 01:48:30,850
so I think nobody rides for free.
They train so hard in Brazil to.

2594
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:34,510
They're insane.
No doubt God no.

2595
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:35,920
And yellow in particular.
Yeah,

2596
01:48:36,130 --> 01:48:38,740
they go to war.
There's a good saying about training.

2597
01:48:39,470 --> 01:48:42,400
I'm smarter and not harder sometimes are
working,

2598
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:43,750
you know,
usually it's working,

2599
01:48:43,751 --> 01:48:47,270
but same thing goes for training.
Overtraining is a big thing in this.

2600
01:48:47,740 --> 01:48:52,740
Yeah.
I'm glad you brought that up because I 

2601
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:53,761
wanted to talk to you about that because
you had mentioned that in the hallway 

2602
01:48:53,761 --> 01:48:53,761
fight he had made sure,
you know,

2603
01:48:53,761 --> 01:48:55,720
we were training for a five round fight 
in particular.

2604
01:48:56,110 --> 01:49:01,110
How do you make sure that you are in 
peak performance level but you're not 

2605
01:49:01,110 --> 01:49:01,300
overtraining?
Like who?

2606
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:02,770
Who Designs your program?

2607
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:04,640
Well,
you know,

2608
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:06,870
I think a lot of it depends on athlete 
input.

2609
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:11,930
Does someone can design a program,
but if you show up one day and you're 

2610
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:12,150
supposed to be pushing sleds,
you know,

2611
01:49:12,151 --> 01:49:14,130
or do something heavy and hard and 
you're like,

2612
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:16,440
I'm exhausted.
Then they're like,

2613
01:49:16,530 --> 01:49:19,110
okay,
we need to dial back your feedback.

2614
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:20,820
Your heart rate.
Yeah.

2615
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:23,190
Yeah.
I wear like a polar heart rate monitor,

2616
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:26,640
I take it in the morning when you wake 
up and all the HRV and see where I'm at.

2617
01:49:26,641 --> 01:49:29,520
And that's really helpful.
The heart rate variable.

2618
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:32,580
Okay.
So basically it tells you how,

2619
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:37,910
how your heart is recovering.
So when you first wake up in the 

2620
01:49:37,910 --> 01:49:37,910
morning,
um,

2621
01:49:37,910 --> 01:49:42,080
from my understanding,
the more like the more that your heart 

2622
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,151
is kind of like irregular,
maybe for a better sense of terms means 

2623
01:49:44,151 --> 01:49:48,531
that it's responding to things like 
quickly if it's kind of sluggish and 

2624
01:49:48,531 --> 01:49:51,351
it's Kinda like not really,
not really reading that kind of quick 

2625
01:49:51,351 --> 01:49:51,520
reaction,
then it's not,

2626
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:53,620
then you're tired,
your body is still broken down.

2627
01:49:53,621 --> 01:49:55,540
It's not recovered though,
you're,

2628
01:49:55,550 --> 01:49:58,150
you're kind of looking for that 
irregular kind of Bouncy,

2629
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:00,280
you know,
I don't know if it's a rhythm,

2630
01:50:00,281 --> 01:50:02,740
but there's something that the,
the hrv reads,

2631
01:50:02,750 --> 01:50:06,400
not just the heart rate but something 
about the heart in it and it reads it.

2632
01:50:06,401 --> 01:50:10,090
The heart rate variable and I'm tells 
you whether you're actually recovered or

2633
01:50:10,091 --> 01:50:10,390
not.

2634
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:13,710
And who goes over this stuff with you?
Do you have a?

2635
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:16,670
Um,
no,

2636
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:18,020
not really.
My sports doctor,

2637
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:19,340
I'll go over it with him.
You know,

2638
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:21,280
you're basically calling the shots.
Yeah,

2639
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:22,610
and it's,
it's really easy to read.

2640
01:50:22,611 --> 01:50:24,500
It's either green,
orange or red,

2641
01:50:24,630 --> 01:50:26,840
like if you're in the red,
don't kill yourself that day.

2642
01:50:26,841 --> 01:50:28,040
Like it tells you it's,
it's,

2643
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:29,240
you know,
it's very simple.

2644
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:34,390
Anyone can do it.
A wake up in the morning and if your 

2645
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:37,061
heart rate variables in the red,
that means like there should be a 

2646
01:50:37,061 --> 01:50:40,240
relatively easy day either a rest day or
relatively easy and maybe should go for 

2647
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:44,231
a nice run,
like just let your body recover because 

2648
01:50:44,231 --> 01:50:46,040
if you don't realize you don't get 
stronger while you're training,

2649
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:48,320
you don't get stronger while you're 
lifting weights,

2650
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:52,430
you're actually damaging your body.
You're actually going backwards.

2651
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:56,540
You get stronger when you're resting,
recovering from the work.

2652
01:50:56,541 --> 01:50:57,660
And that's what,
that's.

2653
01:50:58,190 --> 01:51:00,710
That's literally what it is,
is when you're resting,

2654
01:51:00,711 --> 01:51:03,650
after you've worked out hard and after 
you tore everything apart.

2655
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:07,550
I mean if you work out 24 slash seven,
there's no chance to repair and heal and

2656
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:10,400
grow and get stronger.
So you know,

2657
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:12,110
it,
it just goes back to that,

2658
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:15,710
that science and that balance of when to
push hard and when to,

2659
01:51:15,740 --> 01:51:19,460
when to not push hard.
And I think that our sport typically has

2660
01:51:19,461 --> 01:51:23,210
a lot of really tough people who don't 
like to ever think,

2661
01:51:23,211 --> 01:51:24,950
you know,
they're just in that work hard mentality

2662
01:51:24,951 --> 01:51:27,410
because we're fighters.
We're like the toughest people,

2663
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:29,100
but a lot of times they don't stop and 
think like,

2664
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:32,060
it doesn't matter how tough you are.
Like science is science buddy,

2665
01:51:32,270 --> 01:51:32,800
you know,
it's,

2666
01:51:32,801 --> 01:51:33,730
it's,
it doesn't matter.

2667
01:51:33,731 --> 01:51:35,810
You're going,
I'm just going to work out harder.

2668
01:51:35,811 --> 01:51:40,811
I'm going to push through it.
I'm gonna spar hard today even though I 

2669
01:51:40,811 --> 01:51:40,811
feel like crap.
Like,

2670
01:51:40,811 --> 01:51:42,230
I mean there's something we said maybe 
for mental toughness,

2671
01:51:42,231 --> 01:51:43,130
I guess,
you know,

2672
01:51:43,131 --> 01:51:44,810
you're going to go in there and you're 
going to push through it.

2673
01:51:44,811 --> 01:51:46,640
There's times for that.
But,

2674
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:49,850
um,
I don't question my mental toughness.

2675
01:51:49,851 --> 01:51:51,490
So I just listen to my body.
You know,

2676
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:56,500
I don't,
I'm not at a point in my career where I 

2677
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:56,500
have anything to prove as far as like 
how tough I am.

2678
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:58,880
Skins and Misha,
my coaches always tell me like,

2679
01:51:58,910 --> 01:52:03,910
we're not,
we don't need to approve how tough you 

2680
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:03,910
are.
Me Should we already know that?

2681
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:03,910
So let's just,
uh,

2682
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:04,330
if you don't feel like sparring today 
was tomorrow.

2683
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:06,890
Well that's one of the things

2684
01:52:06,890 --> 01:52:11,600
that I think really does trip up a lot 
of fighters is that they're so tough and

2685
01:52:11,601 --> 01:52:16,601
they figure out how to push through 
injuries to figure out how to force 

2686
01:52:16,601 --> 01:52:19,190
themselves through situations,
but then they get these,

2687
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:23,750
these damage to their joints are damaged
to their back or.

2688
01:52:23,930 --> 01:52:28,930
And a lot of it comes from not recognize
the difference between an actual injury 

2689
01:52:29,270 --> 01:52:31,880
and pain.
Just a little bit of discomfort and pain

2690
01:52:31,881 --> 01:52:33,440
is normal.
It's constant.

2691
01:52:33,441 --> 01:52:38,441
It's never going to go away.
Everybody who does martial arts 

2692
01:52:38,441 --> 01:52:39,290
experiences that,
but for someone like Cain Velasquez,

2693
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:44,500
it almost becomes like a detriment 
because he's such a fucking gorilla and 

2694
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,250
he just knows how to push through 
everything that he blows everything out.

2695
01:52:46,251 --> 01:52:48,600
He blows his shoulder out and then he 
blows the other shoulder around.

2696
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:50,840
He his knees out.
It blows back out.

2697
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:52,010
I mean,
he's,

2698
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:54,170
in my opinion,
when he was at his best,

2699
01:52:54,171 --> 01:52:57,340
he's the greatest of all time is between
him and fader.

2700
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:02,560
Those are the two possible heavyweights 
and the fate or one always has to have 

2701
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:06,950
an asterick because he was fighting in 
pride and it was,

2702
01:53:06,951 --> 01:53:08,300
you know,
the steroid era,

2703
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:11,180
you could do whatever the fuck you want.
Not saying even that he was on it,

2704
01:53:11,181 --> 01:53:13,310
but who the fuck knows,
but that,

2705
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:18,370
I don't think the guys that he fought,
even though he looked amazing against 

2706
01:53:18,370 --> 01:53:22,421
them,
I don't think Hong Man Choi is at the 

2707
01:53:22,421 --> 01:53:25,151
same level as like junior dos Santos 
when junior dos Santos was at his best 

2708
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:27,020
when,
when cain fought them.

2709
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:32,200
It's so hard to.
And I think even junior dos Santos was 

2710
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:33,320
overtrained for one of their fights and 
you know,

2711
01:53:33,321 --> 01:53:35,690
they talked about it like they had 
measured his,

2712
01:53:35,691 --> 01:53:36,770
um,
his,

2713
01:53:36,771 --> 01:53:39,020
um,
creatine levels in his blood and he was,

2714
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:41,360
he was,
he just hadn't recovered correctly.

2715
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:42,190
Yep.
That,

2716
01:53:42,210 --> 01:53:44,220
that's so common.
It's a big part of it.

2717
01:53:44,221 --> 01:53:47,150
It's very being so tough because you see
people go in,

2718
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:49,180
whether it's a three round fight or a 
five round fight,

2719
01:53:49,181 --> 01:53:54,181
sometimes you'll see people gas out like
a round and a half around it and you're 

2720
01:53:54,281 --> 01:53:54,820
like,
oh,

2721
01:53:54,821 --> 01:53:56,000
they must not a train hard.
No,

2722
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:57,300
it's probably the.
They trained too hard.

2723
01:53:57,490 --> 01:53:58,990
Yeah,
that's probably what it is.

2724
01:53:58,991 --> 01:54:01,220
They're probably still beat up 
sometimes.

2725
01:54:01,221 --> 01:54:05,020
Like I will go like fight week and I'll 
be in the workout,

2726
01:54:05,110 --> 01:54:10,110
you know the mat room that they have in 
the hotel and sometimes I'll see these 

2727
01:54:10,110 --> 01:54:11,950
guys in there and they're just going.
I mean they are going,

2728
01:54:11,951 --> 01:54:16,951
they're hitting mitts.
They're just ripping the big take downs 

2729
01:54:16,951 --> 01:54:19,270
and they're just blowing it all out.
I'm just like thinking,

2730
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:21,640
dude,
it's fight week calmed down and the hard

2731
01:54:21,641 --> 01:54:26,641
work should have already all been done.
Like this week is about recovery and 

2732
01:54:26,641 --> 01:54:31,230
usually it's like people not like 
foreigners that are still in that 

2733
01:54:31,230 --> 01:54:32,380
mindset of like know they're a little 
bit more old school mentality.

2734
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:34,960
I feel like some of those gyms still 
haven't caught up to the.

2735
01:54:35,390 --> 01:54:39,040
The idea that it's not always about how 
hard you go.

2736
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:44,600
Well,
Matt Hughes told me that he used to 

2737
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:44,600
train hard up until the day of the 
fight.

2738
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:47,040
They just trained hard and he's like 
always trained hard and you know,

2739
01:54:48,430 --> 01:54:50,230
yeah,
fucking work though.

2740
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:51,390
Worked for him.
Well,

2741
01:54:51,391 --> 01:54:52,210
you know,
but he was,

2742
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:57,840
you know,
he was a high level athlete for a long 

2743
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,380
time and he knew how to,
how to harness what and you know,

2744
01:54:59,410 --> 01:55:01,690
it's not saying that it can't,
that it can't work,

2745
01:55:01,691 --> 01:55:06,691
but I still think that there's something
to be said about preserving the 

2746
01:55:06,691 --> 01:55:08,560
longevity of your career.
You might not be able to do that as long

2747
01:55:09,390 --> 01:55:09,790
you know.

2748
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:11,840
Well,
with a guy like Matt Hughes,

2749
01:55:11,841 --> 01:55:16,841
it's so hard to,
to say that now because he was such a 

2750
01:55:16,841 --> 01:55:18,410
pioneer.
I mean he was at the early,

2751
01:55:18,411 --> 01:55:23,411
early days of the UFC and it was one of 
the great champions and one of the 

2752
01:55:23,411 --> 01:55:27,641
greatest champions ever.
And when you look at his title run and 

2753
01:55:27,641 --> 01:55:29,680
his reign of 170 pound division,
like during his heyday,

2754
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:34,990
he had to say like this guy,
like he's sort of paved the way and a 

2755
01:55:34,990 --> 01:55:36,730
lot of ways,
especially for a wrestler that developed

2756
01:55:36,731 --> 01:55:41,731
some really good submission skills.
I mean he's got some excellent 

2757
01:55:41,731 --> 01:55:43,100
submission victories,
including that arm bar that he submitted

2758
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:48,110
George St Pierre with mean he had some 
really good submission skills for a 

2759
01:55:48,110 --> 01:55:48,110
wrestler.
Yeah,

2760
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:50,400
he's incredible.
Is that it was time a little bit,

2761
01:55:50,401 --> 01:55:53,100
you know,
definitely ahead of his time.

2762
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:55,890
And you know,
an an important pioneer.

2763
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:58,650
If you look at the overall game like 
these,

2764
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:01,950
there's these moments where a person 
emerges and they go,

2765
01:56:01,951 --> 01:56:06,951
okay,
we haven't seen one of those guys 

2766
01:56:06,951 --> 01:56:06,951
before.

2767
01:56:06,951 --> 01:56:06,951
Like Yoyo Rodriguez is a perfect 
example.

2768
01:56:06,951 --> 01:56:09,540
Like this fucking guy.
I watched that guy fight and I go,

2769
01:56:09,541 --> 01:56:11,760
Jesus Christ,
like here's a new thing.

2770
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:16,940
Here's a guy who's like this elite 
taekwondo guy who knows how to do 

2771
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:19,380
everything else too.
But he throws these taekwondo kicks,

2772
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:22,170
like a normal person throws a jab.
He just,

2773
01:56:22,171 --> 01:56:24,510
they're a part of his arsenal.
He's throwing,

2774
01:56:24,511 --> 01:56:29,511
jumping,
roundhouse kicks and we'll kicks and 

2775
01:56:29,511 --> 01:56:29,511
he's,
he's doing shit that like,

2776
01:56:29,511 --> 01:56:33,741
you gotta you gotta get ready for this 
because this guy's going to do this 

2777
01:56:33,741 --> 01:56:35,660
every round and this is a totally 
different type of engaging a.

2778
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:40,680
you've got to be aware of things coming 
from all these crazy angles and they're 

2779
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:43,911
coming fast.
These wheeled kicks and the jumping 

2780
01:56:43,911 --> 01:56:44,490
roundhouse kick did hit a feely with 
like,

2781
01:56:44,491 --> 01:56:46,470
Holy Shit.
That was crazy.

2782
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:47,610
Fucking crazy.
And he's,

2783
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:51,780
he's one of these new guys.
It's like he's got so much skill.

2784
01:56:51,790 --> 01:56:53,560
We used to train with philly.
Did you?

2785
01:56:53,950 --> 01:56:58,840
Sacramento were a part of the team Alpha
male and it was funny like he,

2786
01:56:59,650 --> 01:57:04,650
he's come such a long way like he,
he used to have for some reason he had 

2787
01:57:04,650 --> 01:57:07,200
like a house arrest thing on his ankle,
like the bad things,

2788
01:57:07,201 --> 01:57:08,300
you know,
train with it on.

2789
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:11,320
He had to trim it that.
But he did not want to train.

2790
01:57:11,321 --> 01:57:14,110
So I guess he got permission to go to 
the gym and I don't know what it was,

2791
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:14,920
you know,
what it was for.

2792
01:57:14,921 --> 01:57:16,390
But it's a funny story because it's 
like,

2793
01:57:16,510 --> 01:57:18,790
I just remember him back then and he was
just still like,

2794
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:24,200
you know,
it was still relatively new to the game 

2795
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:26,191
and now you know,
he's doing well and then obviously his 

2796
01:57:26,191 --> 01:57:26,191
last loss.

2797
01:57:26,191 --> 01:57:28,790
Well he zigged and zagged and that's 
just what happens in the game.

2798
01:57:28,850 --> 01:57:33,850
Yeah.
He got caught and he also fought a guy 

2799
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:35,690
who was one of the elite of the elite 
right now at 1:45.

2800
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:38,060
He's unpredictable.
So wild.

2801
01:57:38,190 --> 01:57:40,070
Yeah.
He and his fucking ground game is really

2802
01:57:40,071 --> 01:57:42,110
good to hear.
Can do everything.

2803
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:42,920
Yeah.
Okay.

2804
01:57:42,921 --> 01:57:47,921
Something mad he is signed.
I knew he was something but feeling 

2805
01:57:47,921 --> 01:57:51,581
something to.
He's a tough fucking kid and I thought 

2806
01:57:51,581 --> 01:57:51,581
that was going to be a great fight like 
this.

2807
01:57:51,581 --> 01:57:56,020
I'm really interested to see how feeling
navigates the kicks because that's the 

2808
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:59,411
big thing.
Is he going to try to kick with this 

2809
01:57:59,411 --> 01:57:59,411
guy?
Is he going to try to like.

2810
01:57:59,411 --> 01:58:01,360
Maybe I'm just like,
bear down like did you,

2811
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:04,010
do you watch Gloria at all?
A little bit.

2812
01:58:04,250 --> 01:58:06,550
Did you see Raymond Daniels and Joseph 
Valvoline?

2813
01:58:07,090 --> 01:58:12,090
Valvoline.
He is a traditional Moy Thai style 

2814
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:15,311
fighter and he just just kept his hands 
up high and just chop the legs and 

2815
01:58:15,311 --> 01:58:17,510
chopped them down and eventually knocked
them out with a head kick,

2816
01:58:17,870 --> 01:58:20,730
but Raymond Daniels is this wild 
motherfucker,

2817
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:21,590
throws,
jumping,

2818
01:58:21,591 --> 01:58:23,040
spinning,
threesixty,

2819
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:25,550
turning sidekicks to your face and all 
this wild shit.

2820
01:58:25,730 --> 01:58:30,730
And he was a point karate champion who 
eventually got into kickboxing and he's 

2821
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:35,081
so wild with his kicks.
Just he hit this guy with a touch front 

2822
01:58:35,301 --> 01:58:40,301
leg side kick and then spun in the air 
and hit them with a spinning back kick 

2823
01:58:40,301 --> 01:58:45,110
to the face where people like that who 
can recreate that style to get someone 

2824
01:58:45,110 --> 01:58:46,030
like him.
You'd have to get a karate or that.

2825
01:58:46,550 --> 01:58:49,330
It's like it's all you can get,
you know?

2826
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:54,630
Well,
it's people that don't understand that 

2827
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:57,931
there's,
there's some skills that these 

2828
01:58:57,931 --> 01:58:57,970
traditional martial artists have like a 
traditional,

2829
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:01,750
like a lot of karate guys and a lot of 
talk window guys in particular.

2830
01:59:01,930 --> 01:59:03,820
There's some things that they can do 
with their legs.

2831
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:07,930
The average person just can't do.
And if that karate guy or that taekwondo

2832
01:59:07,931 --> 01:59:10,570
guy like a year Rodriguez,
learns wrestling,

2833
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:12,910
learns Jujitsu,
and learns kickboxing,

2834
01:59:13,330 --> 01:59:16,930
and has all that shit at a really elite 
black belt level,

2835
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:18,040
you're fucked.

2836
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:22,240
Someone a good friend of yours.
It can do weird things with his legs.

2837
01:59:22,570 --> 01:59:23,910
Eddie Bravo.
Oh yeah.

2838
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:26,740
Lowered guy is like,
he's like gumby.

2839
01:59:26,830 --> 01:59:29,350
Well he's been stretching his legs like 
that.

2840
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:31,780
Like,
like religiously for Jack.

2841
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:33,870
He not that flexible like growing up 
now.

2842
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,220
He just keeps doing it.
Did Eddie,

2843
01:59:36,221 --> 01:59:38,740
when you watch TV with Eddie,
Eddie will never wear shoes.

2844
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:43,920
He doesn't wear shoes.
Just puts his fucking feet everywhere 

2845
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:46,261
and it kind of freaks people out.
But Eddie will sit there and he'll just 

2846
01:59:46,261 --> 01:59:49,330
like be like stretching himself up.
So He'd be sitting watching TV and he'll

2847
01:59:49,331 --> 01:59:54,331
be ready to get to,
but he'll be like sitting there and 

2848
01:59:54,331 --> 01:59:56,500
it'll hold it and he can do that without
like pulling on it.

2849
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:01,800
Like he doesn't have to have arms that 
pull his legs in these positions so he 

2850
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:05,671
could just tuck his legs in the places 
and all of a sudden you're like locked 

2851
02:00:05,671 --> 02:00:09,601
up in a Gogo plot.
And you don't even know how the fuck he 

2852
02:00:09,601 --> 02:00:11,881
got his leg there.
I know I grappled with him once years 

2853
02:00:11,881 --> 02:00:12,420
ago.
He was like retarded.

2854
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:13,360
Really tricky.
But he's like,

2855
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:15,790
dude,
you're like grappling with the dude.

2856
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:21,090
Is that feel good or that.

2857
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:22,510
Yeah,
that's always a compliment.

2858
02:00:22,511 --> 02:00:24,370
As long as people don't say,
I look like a dude,

2859
02:00:24,371 --> 02:00:25,990
I can grapple.
I could do it all day long.

2860
02:00:25,991 --> 02:00:27,260
And that's never,
you know,

2861
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:30,070
never an issue.
I dread the day when like I love it when

2862
02:00:30,071 --> 02:00:30,670
people were like,
oh,

2863
02:00:30,671 --> 02:00:31,690
you don't look like a fighter.
I'm like,

2864
02:00:31,691 --> 02:00:32,380
good,
that's good.

2865
02:00:32,381 --> 02:00:37,381
Because like,
it really dread the day when people 

2866
02:00:37,381 --> 02:00:37,381
like,
man,

2867
02:00:37,381 --> 02:00:37,381
you look like a fighter.
Like,

2868
02:00:37,381 --> 02:00:38,530
oh whoops.
Went too far.

2869
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:43,770
I,
I pushed the edge of the envelope and I 

2870
02:00:43,770 --> 02:00:45,060
didn't come out on the winning side.
The grapple like a dude is isn't okay.

2871
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:45,620
Like,
yeah,

2872
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:50,380
you make out like a dude that's not yet.
How do you know?

2873
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:57,440
Is this conversation going back?
Well,

2874
02:00:58,290 --> 02:01:03,290
there is a definite difference between 
watching some women grapple and what 

2875
02:01:04,210 --> 02:01:09,210
some women can do it in.
This got to be some benefits to like 

2876
02:01:09,210 --> 02:01:09,310
being a woman when it comes to 
grappling.

2877
02:01:09,370 --> 02:01:10,330
There is sometimes like,
yeah,

2878
02:01:10,350 --> 02:01:15,350
oh,
rappel some guys and I don't realize 

2879
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:15,350
it's much different to be like,
man,

2880
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:16,280
you are so flexible or like you've got,
you know,

2881
02:01:16,530 --> 02:01:21,530
your ankles.
Like I try to log and it was like most 

2882
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:21,530
guys would attack,
but he was like,

2883
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:21,530
you were fine.
I was like,

2884
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:22,020
I,
you know,

2885
02:01:22,050 --> 02:01:22,470
I don't know.

2886
02:01:22,610 --> 02:01:25,250
Have you ever seen this thing that 
ballerinas used?

2887
02:01:25,310 --> 02:01:27,770
And this is a,
I think it's a new device,

2888
02:01:27,771 --> 02:01:31,430
but it's like you slide your foot into 
like this.

2889
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:33,950
It seems like a rubber sheath has like 
this,

2890
02:01:33,951 --> 02:01:38,951
a flat board and they just like this 
rubber sheath and you slide your foot 

2891
02:01:38,951 --> 02:01:40,550
into and that do these exercises

2892
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:45,550
with your foot.
And somebody put it up on one of the 

2893
02:01:45,550 --> 02:01:45,560
Jujitsu pages that I follow on 
instagram.

2894
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:50,740
And they were like,
this is the best way to prevent foot 

2895
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:51,440
locks.
Like literally it just strengthens it,

2896
02:01:51,441 --> 02:01:56,441
strengthens it,
and stretches it to the point where if 

2897
02:01:56,441 --> 02:01:56,441
somebody gets you into like a,
um,

2898
02:01:56,441 --> 02:02:01,260
a footlocker and they're pushing down 
like a toehold in there as they're 

2899
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:02,950
pushing down on your foot,
it's the hyper extending of the ankle if

2900
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:04,330
it gets you to tap because you're like,
oh,

2901
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:09,340
I think someone's going to tear and the 
people tap and this gets your foot into 

2902
02:02:09,501 --> 02:02:14,501
this flexible position where you've kind
of strengthen and make it so flexible 

2903
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:17,330
that you can't get tapped in certain 
ways.

2904
02:02:17,331 --> 02:02:19,070
You never tried.
You haven't Jamie's odors.

2905
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:21,980
Huh?
That looks similar.

2906
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:25,300
That's similar as pro arch.
Is that what's it's called?

2907
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:28,010
That looks like it's making it like 
where your feet are like.

2908
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:30,290
So yeah,
like the arch of the Ballerina foot.

2909
02:02:30,291 --> 02:02:32,340
That's probably like strengthening.
Huh?

2910
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:34,580
To be able to stand on that.
What does that.

2911
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:37,000
You weren't.
Birkenstocks is brutal.

2912
02:02:37,070 --> 02:02:41,720
The feet feet are so nasty,
so bad.

2913
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:44,070
It's like,
Oh,

2914
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:46,640
I thought my feet were bad news girl who
is a ballerina,

2915
02:02:46,641 --> 02:02:49,090
and she had to have her feet fixed 
because her,

2916
02:02:49,150 --> 02:02:53,660
her toes,
she had smashed her toes for so long,

2917
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:58,190
like doing like point and trying to 
stand on their toes that she had to get,

2918
02:02:58,191 --> 02:03:02,150
like she had these scars over the top of
her feet where she had to get her toes,

2919
02:03:02,151 --> 02:03:05,120
like realigned and deter ligaments 
repaired.

2920
02:03:05,390 --> 02:03:08,100
Valets,
a hard hard support from,

2921
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:13,130
from my understanding,
like I don't think they get enough 

2922
02:03:13,130 --> 02:03:13,130
credit.
They also have to starve themselves.

2923
02:03:13,130 --> 02:03:15,830
You have to be one.
Did you see that swan movie?

2924
02:03:15,831 --> 02:03:16,340
Was it black?

2925
02:03:16,990 --> 02:03:17,630
Yeah,
freaky.

2926
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:20,740
It was insane.
Oh yeah.

2927
02:03:21,590 --> 02:03:24,760
It's not a woman's empowering sort of 
activity.

2928
02:03:24,970 --> 02:03:28,110
Yeah.
I posted a picture of me with a scale of

2929
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:29,140
the day,
like weighing myself.

2930
02:03:29,141 --> 02:03:34,141
People like 1:47,
they're like freaking out about it or 

2931
02:03:34,141 --> 02:03:34,180
whatever.
I'm like,

2932
02:03:34,181 --> 02:03:34,830
yeah,
wait,

2933
02:03:34,860 --> 02:03:37,060
you know,
almost 150 pounds.

2934
02:03:37,061 --> 02:03:39,300
But they're like,
I feel like that's good that not,

2935
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:44,340
you know,
it goes to show you don't have to be a 

2936
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:44,920
hundred pounds or 110 pounds to look 
good or be beautiful or whatever.

2937
02:03:44,921 --> 02:03:45,330
And I'm like,
yeah,

2938
02:03:45,331 --> 02:03:47,410
I don't,
I'm not ashamed of what I way at all,

2939
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:48,910
like at all at all.
I don't care.

2940
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:52,120
I get weigh a hundred 60 pounds as long 
as I look good and feel good.

2941
02:03:52,121 --> 02:03:53,260
Like,
you know,

2942
02:03:53,261 --> 02:03:57,280
people were just kind of surprised that 
I guess women have numbers in their head

2943
02:03:57,281 --> 02:03:58,330
that you don't want to go over.

2944
02:03:58,450 --> 02:04:00,460
Yeah.
Thirty five is like the peak.

2945
02:04:00,461 --> 02:04:01,900
Don't get bigger than this.

2946
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:04,740
Yeah,
I think it used to be like 1:10.

2947
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:07,980
My mom's best friend growing up,
she was um,

2948
02:04:08,130 --> 02:04:13,130
she was Vietnamese and they had,
they had a rule where she's having to 

2949
02:04:13,321 --> 02:04:15,810
me,
so the Vietnamese side of her family,

2950
02:04:15,811 --> 02:04:17,790
so she was a little bit bigger bone.
Gorgeous,

2951
02:04:17,791 --> 02:04:19,770
beautiful.
Like exotic green eyes,

2952
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:22,170
dark black hair like halfway to me is 
really,

2953
02:04:22,171 --> 02:04:24,250
really pretty.
And um,

2954
02:04:24,450 --> 02:04:28,710
her family was so hard on her because 
she weighed over a hundred pounds,

2955
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:31,890
like you were supposed to be under.
You're supposed to be 99 or less because

2956
02:04:31,891 --> 02:04:33,600
they're all super tiny,
but she was half,

2957
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:35,850
so her aunt,
she got her half of her White Dad's side

2958
02:04:35,851 --> 02:04:38,040
and she was like on nine or something

2959
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:39,140
and was like,
Yo,

2960
02:04:39,170 --> 02:04:40,200
you lose weight,
Lynn.

2961
02:04:40,410 --> 02:04:41,280
Lynn,
you lose weight.

2962
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:42,960
You too heavy.
Too heavy.

2963
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:44,810
Yeah,
yeah,

2964
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:45,690
yeah.
Oh yeah.

2965
02:04:45,691 --> 02:04:50,691
And she had just,
she got eating disorders and stuff like 

2966
02:04:50,691 --> 02:04:50,691
that.
And like later,

2967
02:04:50,691 --> 02:04:52,560
because she was so just mortified that 
she weighed more,

2968
02:04:52,561 --> 02:04:54,180
you know,
they didn't want her to weigh over 100.

2969
02:04:54,340 --> 02:04:55,620
Oh,
that's so crazy.

2970
02:04:55,621 --> 02:04:58,580
The number crazy number on things.
Numbers.

2971
02:04:58,800 --> 02:04:59,820
Yeah.
It doesn't matter to me.

2972
02:04:59,821 --> 02:05:01,830
How do you look if you look good,
what does it,

2973
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:04,800
what difference does it make?
Like obviously being a fighter,

2974
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:06,480
you're going to be denser.
I mean,

2975
02:05:06,481 --> 02:05:09,420
how anybody wouldn't understand that a 
woman like you,

2976
02:05:09,450 --> 02:05:10,410
what do you like?
Five,

2977
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:11,220
seven,
five,

2978
02:05:11,221 --> 02:05:11,960
six,
five,

2979
02:05:11,970 --> 02:05:12,810
six,
five,

2980
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:16,050
six,
145 pounds.

2981
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:18,300
You're going to have a ton of muscle.
I mean,

2982
02:05:18,340 --> 02:05:20,340
you have to,
if you're doing all the grappling,

2983
02:05:20,341 --> 02:05:23,460
you're doing what kind of strength and 
conditioning program and you on,

2984
02:05:24,370 --> 02:05:25,680
um,
I go usually like two,

2985
02:05:25,690 --> 02:05:30,690
three days a week and I go to this place
called phase one sports and they work 

2986
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:33,751
with a lot of athletes that were the 
boxers and football players and things 

2987
02:05:33,751 --> 02:05:36,691
like that.
So I do like the most that I really do 

2988
02:05:36,691 --> 02:05:40,351
for like actual lifting weights is 
probably power cleans or like hang 

2989
02:05:40,351 --> 02:05:40,351
cleans.
I go,

2990
02:05:40,351 --> 02:05:44,360
you know,
flip the bar that's I think really good 

2991
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:44,590
explosive movement for um,
like for wrestling and things like that.

2992
02:05:45,110 --> 02:05:50,110
Um,
I do sled pushing and do a lot of body 

2993
02:05:50,110 --> 02:05:50,110
weight stuff,
a lot of footwork and you know,

2994
02:05:50,110 --> 02:05:54,771
um,
we kind of mix cardio and weight so 

2995
02:05:54,771 --> 02:05:57,931
we'll do like,
he'll like do one set of the workout 

2996
02:05:57,931 --> 02:05:59,050
that's strength based.
So it's like anaerobic.

2997
02:05:59,110 --> 02:06:02,680
And then we'll run sprints.
So kind of like to simulate a fight.

2998
02:06:02,681 --> 02:06:06,370
Like you're going through a,
a combination and it's anaerobic,

2999
02:06:06,371 --> 02:06:11,371
you throwing five,
six punches and you're doing that 

3000
02:06:11,371 --> 02:06:11,371
without oxygen.

3001
02:06:11,371 --> 02:06:12,420
Anaerobic.
And then you do something where,

3002
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:17,440
you know,
you circle away and you move or 

3003
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:17,440
something that's a robotic,
you know,

3004
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:18,010
are you coming for the take down?
That's kind of an anaerobic movement.

3005
02:06:18,011 --> 02:06:20,770
And then so it simulates the fight.
So we do a lot of,

3006
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:22,690
um,
I don't know,

3007
02:06:22,780 --> 02:06:24,520
it's not really anything super rocket 
science,

3008
02:06:24,521 --> 02:06:26,130
I don't think.
But I like it.

3009
02:06:26,131 --> 02:06:31,131
It works for me.
She's done a strength and conditioning 

3010
02:06:31,131 --> 02:06:31,131
program.
I love strength and conditioning and I'm

3011
02:06:31,131 --> 02:06:33,040
in high school and stuff.
I lifted a lot of weights.

3012
02:06:33,041 --> 02:06:35,950
I get criticized a lot actually in high 
school because I was pretty buff in high

3013
02:06:35,951 --> 02:06:40,951
school and I wrestled and criticized 
when girls or boys actually guys mostly 

3014
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:47,400
I think the girls were kind of scared of
me even though I was never 

3015
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:47,400
confrontational.
I never really fought people.

3016
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:49,990
It was like pretty nice everyone.
But I'm like,

3017
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:51,610
I don't know,
the girls are probably like,

3018
02:06:51,611 --> 02:06:54,460
if they knew,
if they would mess with me,

3019
02:06:54,461 --> 02:06:56,380
I probably would have wrecked them.
You know what?

3020
02:06:56,381 --> 02:07:01,381
I was just kinda like passive.
I was a people watcher and uh,

3021
02:07:01,540 --> 02:07:02,530
yeah,
like the guys were like,

3022
02:07:02,531 --> 02:07:03,720
man,
stop lifting.

3023
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:06,580
MEESHA getting to buff.
Like maybe you need to lift more.

3024
02:07:08,710 --> 02:07:11,940
Were you wrestling in high school?
I wrestled in high school.

3025
02:07:12,090 --> 02:07:14,190
What was that like?
That was hard,

3026
02:07:14,191 --> 02:07:19,191
man.
It was actually the first half of my 

3027
02:07:19,191 --> 02:07:19,191
season was terrible.
But you wrestling dudes.

3028
02:07:19,191 --> 02:07:21,540
Are you wrestling girls?
Primarily guys.

3029
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:26,600
That's ridiculous.
I was the only consistent female on my 

3030
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:30,021
team for four years.
What the fuck motivated you to go do 

3031
02:07:30,021 --> 02:07:30,870
that?
I'm just like wrestling dudes.

3032
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:33,270
Yeah.
No,

3033
02:07:33,271 --> 02:07:34,620
actually that was that.
Like I said,

3034
02:07:34,621 --> 02:07:36,850
it was terrible.
Like my first day.

3035
02:07:37,090 --> 02:07:39,070
My Gosh.
Well I'll get to why I did it.

3036
02:07:39,220 --> 02:07:41,770
I did it because I can't play 
basketball.

3037
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:45,730
That was really the reason why I didn't 
do it.

3038
02:07:45,770 --> 02:07:47,450
Did you want to play basketball?
No,

3039
02:07:47,950 --> 02:07:52,950
I hate basketball.
Well that's probably why he can't play 

3040
02:07:52,950 --> 02:07:54,631
basketball because I bet if you wanted 
to play basketball you figured out how 

3041
02:07:54,631 --> 02:07:55,110
to get really good at basketball.
So don't,

3042
02:07:55,200 --> 02:08:00,200
don't say you can't play basketball.
It would have been a long road man.

3043
02:08:01,430 --> 02:08:05,020
I couldn't it ever tell you.
It's taken a long time as if MMA isn't a

3044
02:08:05,021 --> 02:08:06,970
long road,
but it's way more fun.

3045
02:08:07,030 --> 02:08:10,420
What does it mean crazy though,
that the odds of you getting famous as a

3046
02:08:10,421 --> 02:08:13,300
female basketball player or nonexistent?
Yeah,

3047
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:16,150
there was like,
I mean the NBA still exists,

3048
02:08:16,151 --> 02:08:19,030
right?
Name one famous NBA player named one.

3049
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:20,080
Go ahead.
Ready Go.

3050
02:08:20,230 --> 02:08:23,170
You can't do it.
But female fighters at the time,

3051
02:08:23,171 --> 02:08:28,171
it was ridiculous.
If you're in high school and said one 

3052
02:08:28,171 --> 02:08:28,171
day I'm going to be a female cage 
fighter.

3053
02:08:28,171 --> 02:08:29,770
People like it was crazy bitch.
Get away from her.

3054
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:32,590
She never fucking mind.
Meanwhile you're famous.

3055
02:08:33,190 --> 02:08:35,410
He was just barely coming out.
I was like,

3056
02:08:35,411 --> 02:08:37,680
so I know it's crazy.
Um,

3057
02:08:38,410 --> 02:08:41,700
so I decided to do it out of default 
because I want to do,

3058
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:46,800
to do a sport,
but I was really reluctant to play 

3059
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:46,990
basketball or even try.
Didn't like,

3060
02:08:46,991 --> 02:08:49,720
it just didn't appeal to me.
You didn't click can't dribble the ball.

3061
02:08:49,830 --> 02:08:51,250
He did.
I don't shoot well,

3062
02:08:51,251 --> 02:08:52,780
like I didn't pee a couple times.
I'm like,

3063
02:08:52,781 --> 02:08:55,570
this is not the sport for me.
I can't jump very high.

3064
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:59,200
Like everything is just like not I'm not
made to play basketball.

3065
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:02,890
And so I went out for wrestling and I 
was like,

3066
02:09:02,891 --> 02:09:04,150
yeah,
I guess I'll try this.

3067
02:09:04,270 --> 02:09:09,270
And uh,
we didn't tell my dad at first either 

3068
02:09:09,270 --> 02:09:09,270
because he would have probably been 
mortified.

3069
02:09:09,270 --> 02:09:13,800
He was mortified when we told him,
but it was too late by then already I 

3070
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:13,800
was already in.

3071
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:18,450
It was,
I think my mom thought I was going to 

3072
02:09:18,450 --> 02:09:20,191
quit.
So she tried to hide it from him for 

3073
02:09:20,191 --> 02:09:20,191
like two,
three weeks or so,

3074
02:09:20,191 --> 02:09:20,710
like thinking,
oh,

3075
02:09:20,711 --> 02:09:25,711
she's probably going like this,
but I love the girls were on the team 

3076
02:09:25,711 --> 02:09:26,440
with you.
One other girl that was my best friend,

3077
02:09:26,441 --> 02:09:28,150
Sharon,
and it was actually her idea.

3078
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:29,590
I never probably would have thought of 
it.

3079
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:34,920
We were an honors English class,
will smarty pants and she looks at me 

3080
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:35,650
and she's like,
you know,

3081
02:09:35,651 --> 02:09:40,651
everything,
you want to do a sport but I don't want 

3082
02:09:40,651 --> 02:09:40,651
to play basketball either.
You want to go out for wrestling.

3083
02:09:40,651 --> 02:09:42,550
I like wrestling and I always taught 
wrestling was so weird.

3084
02:09:42,610 --> 02:09:45,880
Like in middle school as a kid I'm like,
what are they doing?

3085
02:09:45,890 --> 02:09:50,440
Like these boys in these tight suits 
like rolling around.

3086
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:55,480
This is a weird um,
so I had this like distaste for 

3087
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:55,480
wrestling,
but it's kind of like,

3088
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:57,490
well,
it's better than basketball probably.

3089
02:09:57,490 --> 02:09:57,880
Yeah,
sure.

3090
02:09:57,881 --> 02:10:00,500
Let's try it.
Yeah,

3091
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:05,520
that's how.
I mean it's nothing against the 

3092
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:05,520
basketball,
but I just,

3093
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:05,520
I just can't.
I don't know.

3094
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:07,060
How did you know that you liked it?
Wrestling?

3095
02:10:07,100 --> 02:10:12,100
Yeah.
Well the first day I got my ass kicked 

3096
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:15,210
bad.
Like I left with like Matt Burns all 

3097
02:10:15,210 --> 02:10:15,310
over my body and my face,
like I didn't know what I was doing.

3098
02:10:15,311 --> 02:10:17,290
They tried to get me to quit.
They didn't want the girl,

3099
02:10:17,291 --> 02:10:20,210
they did not want us there.
And so they meaning the teammates,

3100
02:10:20,300 --> 02:10:21,910
teammates and the coaches.
Really?

3101
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:23,150
Yeah,
the coach.

3102
02:10:23,151 --> 02:10:25,510
Yeah.
The coach was kind of an ass,

3103
02:10:25,511 --> 02:10:28,000
like he was only there for one year.
He actually ended up getting,

3104
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:30,250
he had of getting fired.
But anyways,

3105
02:10:30,251 --> 02:10:31,750
um,
yeah,

3106
02:10:31,751 --> 02:10:33,370
they did not want us there.
So I think they thought like,

3107
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:34,010
if we make this as

3108
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:36,830
hard on them as possible,
they'll just quit because that's like,

3109
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:38,840
you know,
I think they had a couple years before,

3110
02:10:38,841 --> 02:10:40,370
like a girl come out and like they 
didn't,

3111
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:45,400
they never lost,
like they never made it past the two 

3112
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:45,400
weeks.
So I think I kind of felt that and I was

3113
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:46,720
like,
you just wait for us.

3114
02:10:46,730 --> 02:10:48,440
I was like,
I'm going to prove you wrong.

3115
02:10:48,441 --> 02:10:50,120
I'm going to stick around,
I'm going to do this.

3116
02:10:50,121 --> 02:10:52,130
And I was like,
and as sure as hell no,

3117
02:10:52,131 --> 02:10:53,630
I can't get any worse.
It was like,

3118
02:10:53,631 --> 02:10:57,080
so the law of diminishing returns says 
I'm bound to get better.

3119
02:10:57,740 --> 02:10:58,880
And um,
yeah,

3120
02:10:58,881 --> 02:11:02,660
I kept coming back every day and it was 
the hardest thing that I've ever done.

3121
02:11:02,661 --> 02:11:06,080
I think that's why I liked it so much.
It was fucking hard,

3122
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:07,760
really,
really hard.

3123
02:11:07,761 --> 02:11:09,530
And they did a lot of conditioning,
a lot of,

3124
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:11,000
you know,
but I loved,

3125
02:11:11,050 --> 02:11:12,200
I didn't mind that at all.

3126
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:14,030
Like I love that stuff.
I love working,

3127
02:11:14,031 --> 02:11:16,550
I love conditioning,
I love pushing myself.

3128
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:21,880
The part that was the most challenging 
was the actual wrestling because they 

3129
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:22,280
didn't want to teach us anything.
They didn't teach me anything.

3130
02:11:22,281 --> 02:11:27,281
I remember they put me in there with a 
guy who placed third in state and he 

3131
02:11:27,281 --> 02:11:28,040
just wrecked me.
I was like,

3132
02:11:28,041 --> 02:11:29,810
can you at least show me a double ad?
I was like,

3133
02:11:29,811 --> 02:11:34,811
I don't know anything.
I don't know how to do any of this 

3134
02:11:34,811 --> 02:11:34,811
stuff.
Like,

3135
02:11:34,811 --> 02:11:34,811
can you show me?
They're like,

3136
02:11:34,811 --> 02:11:34,811
just a body.
Yeah.

3137
02:11:34,811 --> 02:11:34,811
They're like,
no,

3138
02:11:34,811 --> 02:11:36,620
just go wrestle and you just embarrassed
me.

3139
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:38,960
What a Shitty fucking wrestling coach.
Yeah.

3140
02:11:38,961 --> 02:11:40,760
Well,
I don't know.

3141
02:11:40,761 --> 02:11:45,761
They didn't want us there.
Was that the first time that you knew 

3142
02:11:45,761 --> 02:11:47,921
about yourself though,
that you liked to overcome adversity 

3143
02:11:47,921 --> 02:11:51,071
like that,
that you could do liked difficult 

3144
02:11:51,071 --> 02:11:51,071
challenges?

3145
02:11:51,071 --> 02:11:53,860
Looking back on it?
I think so because I didn't realize how 

3146
02:11:53,860 --> 02:11:55,670
tough I was until I got through like a 
wrestling season.

3147
02:11:55,671 --> 02:11:56,780
I'm like,
holy crap.

3148
02:11:57,080 --> 02:12:02,080
That was really hard.
Brutal for people who've never done 

3149
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:03,790
anything difficult to is probably like 
the first.

3150
02:12:04,970 --> 02:12:08,900
Most people don't say when you start out
with a big team and half the people drop

3151
02:12:08,901 --> 02:12:13,901
like flies really quickly,
a couple of kind of dwindle out and 

3152
02:12:13,901 --> 02:12:15,950
you're left with like a few that are 
really there to do it.

3153
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:18,080
And especially with me being so 
terrible,

3154
02:12:18,081 --> 02:12:20,140
like I lost.
Um,

3155
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,640
I mean I probably lost about every match
that you're,

3156
02:12:22,660 --> 02:12:25,130
I'd never wrestled before and I was 
competing against guys.

3157
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:27,410
Um,
I can't remember exactly.

3158
02:12:27,450 --> 02:12:32,450
Uh,
I think I'd be a girl like later in the 

3159
02:12:32,450 --> 02:12:34,840
season,
my first year and I lost my very first 

3160
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:34,840
wrestling match was actually against 
another female,

3161
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:36,740
which was rare and it lost by points,
but she was like a senior,

3162
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:38,480
so it was whatever.

3163
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:40,400
I just tried to know.
I got pinned.

3164
02:12:40,670 --> 02:12:43,430
That's a lie.
I remember I got Penn,

3165
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:46,070
she was a senior,
it was like second round and I didn't,

3166
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:47,300
I just didn't know very much,
you know.

3167
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:50,150
And uh,
then I went on it.

3168
02:12:50,151 --> 02:12:52,580
Actually my senior year I ended up 
wrestling varsity.

3169
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:54,030
Whoa.
Yeah,

3170
02:12:54,140 --> 02:12:56,420
that's crazy.
So you went through freshmen,

3171
02:12:56,421 --> 02:12:57,410
sophomore,
junior,

3172
02:12:57,411 --> 02:12:58,650
and senior year.
Yeah.

3173
02:12:58,850 --> 02:13:00,110
All four years.
Four years.

3174
02:13:00,111 --> 02:13:00,840
You wrestled?
Yeah.

3175
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:02,510
That's amazing.
I loved it.

3176
02:13:02,690 --> 02:13:05,120
Won't go live for it.
That's crazy.

3177
02:13:05,121 --> 02:13:10,121
Yeah.
And the senior year you were a varsity 

3178
02:13:10,121 --> 02:13:11,150
wrestler.
What in the fuck what?

3179
02:13:11,151 --> 02:13:13,280
Wait,
this is the hilarious part.

3180
02:13:13,281 --> 02:13:13,910
Okay.
So.

3181
02:13:13,940 --> 02:13:18,380
So I was good but I wasn't male varsity 
good.

3182
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:19,670
You know,
I love wrestling.

3183
02:13:19,671 --> 02:13:21,020
I worked hard.
I came early,

3184
02:13:21,021 --> 02:13:22,070
I stayed late,
I did all that.

3185
02:13:22,610 --> 02:13:26,120
But um,
I wasn't that level right.

3186
02:13:26,121 --> 02:13:27,860
But,
but the thing was is that we didn't have

3187
02:13:27,861 --> 02:13:29,210
152 pounder.

3188
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:31,830
We had to one $45.
So I wrestled 1:45.

3189
02:13:31,831 --> 02:13:34,410
I didn't know how to cut weight so it's 
just what I was walking at at the time.

3190
02:13:34,530 --> 02:13:38,640
I was heavier and heavier in high school
than I am now and I didn't know anything

3191
02:13:38,641 --> 02:13:40,290
about diet.
I didn't know anything about anything.

3192
02:13:40,410 --> 02:13:42,630
I thought what I joe,
this is how stupid I was.

3193
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:47,900
I thought that when I had to make wait 
the next day that I needed to eat the 

3194
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:51,651
most low calorie foods,
so I would go like get the jar of salsa 

3195
02:13:51,651 --> 02:13:55,440
which has had or I don't know how many 
thousands of milligrams of sodium,

3196
02:13:55,530 --> 02:13:57,600
which is going to help you hold water.
I didn't know.

3197
02:13:57,601 --> 02:13:58,170
It's like,
oh,

3198
02:13:58,171 --> 02:14:00,690
it's five calories per serving,
let me eat this whole thing.

3199
02:14:00,691 --> 02:14:05,691
And then like,
I'm sure it was like a balloon the next 

3200
02:14:05,691 --> 02:14:08,060
day.
Like it's no wonder like I couldn't cut 

3201
02:14:08,060 --> 02:14:09,771
any way like nobody,
nobody taught me anything about cutting 

3202
02:14:12,841 --> 02:14:15,510
wakes up to eat,
throw garbage bag on and run around,

3203
02:14:16,220 --> 02:14:16,550
you know.

3204
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:19,190
And so anyways,
um,

3205
02:14:19,230 --> 02:14:20,340
there was two,
1:45

3206
02:14:20,341 --> 02:14:21,720
pounders,
no 1:52

3207
02:14:21,721 --> 02:14:23,670
pounders.
So what they would do is basically I was

3208
02:14:23,671 --> 02:14:27,720
the sacrificial lamb.
We would both weigh in at 1:45

3209
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:32,750
for varsity and they would decide which 
opponent was more likely for the guy,

3210
02:14:34,290 --> 02:14:39,290
our guy teammate to beat.
And they would match him up so that we 

3211
02:14:39,290 --> 02:14:40,560
could get a win and they would put me 
with the tougher opponent.

3212
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:45,600
So that our guy that had a chance at 
winning could win because they were like

3213
02:14:45,601 --> 02:14:47,400
the new.
Either way I probably wasn't able to win

3214
02:14:47,401 --> 02:14:48,130
and get.
I mean these are,

3215
02:14:48,260 --> 02:14:50,560
these are tough guys.
Like I've been wrestling for years.

3216
02:14:50,561 --> 02:14:51,960
They'd been wrestling their whole life.
Right.

3217
02:14:52,170 --> 02:14:55,800
And they're cutting weight.
So half the time I'm wrestling 1:50,

3218
02:14:55,801 --> 02:14:59,340
two pound men.
Like I'm weighing in at 1:45

3219
02:14:59,430 --> 02:15:02,820
on Vr,
on the Varsity team and just getting,

3220
02:15:02,850 --> 02:15:04,800
you know.
Oh my gosh.

3221
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:06,600
Did you beat any dudes?
I did,

3222
02:15:06,601 --> 02:15:09,870
but not in Varsity varsity guys.
But I beat some other guys.

3223
02:15:09,871 --> 02:15:11,530
I made him cry,
I made a few guys quit.

3224
02:15:12,630 --> 02:15:14,310
It would always get back to our school.

3225
02:15:16,330 --> 02:15:18,180
It would always get back to our school 
to like,

3226
02:15:18,210 --> 02:15:19,740
Oh yeah,
that guy you beat last week.

3227
02:15:19,741 --> 02:15:21,990
He quit the team.
Yeah.

3228
02:15:22,050 --> 02:15:24,000
I would come back to our school because 
obviously there was a,

3229
02:15:24,090 --> 02:15:25,470
you know,
a rival school or whatever.

3230
02:15:25,471 --> 02:15:27,020
But somehow it would get back to it.
Yeah.

3231
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:30,060
Like I guess he quit the team.
I wonder how much that.

3232
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:33,160
I don't know.
I don't.

3233
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:35,230
I didn't care.
Wound care.

3234
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:37,830
I didn't care,
of course.

3235
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:40,280
I mean you can't.
No,

3236
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:41,790
we're not gonna make it.
Yeah.

3237
02:15:41,910 --> 02:15:45,480
You gotta keep going one time.
Do you know what a Saturday night right?

3238
02:15:45,481 --> 02:15:46,230
Is?
Sure.

3239
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:47,790
Yeah.
Can you explain it to people?

3240
02:15:48,630 --> 02:15:50,910
It's the most brilliant.
So it's basically,

3241
02:15:51,290 --> 02:15:54,630
I'll tell you a story.
I got by like a hundred 50,

3242
02:15:54,631 --> 02:15:58,140
two pounds state placer.
I weighed in at 1:45.

3243
02:15:58,170 --> 02:16:03,170
I remember he wrestled for White River 
and he went out and just bulldoze me 

3244
02:16:03,781 --> 02:16:07,260
right over and Saturday night ride pin 
me and like 18 seconds.

3245
02:16:07,261 --> 02:16:12,261
I mean he crushed me but it's the most 
embarrassing and do like it's a last,

3246
02:16:12,750 --> 02:16:17,750
like if you're a girl in high school,
that's the last way that you want them 

3247
02:16:17,750 --> 02:16:17,750
to on.
So basically they,

3248
02:16:17,750 --> 02:16:22,550
they lay like straight on top of you in 
like a starfish position and they wrap 

3249
02:16:23,011 --> 02:16:28,011
your arm both of your arms with their 
arms and wrap your legs with your legs 

3250
02:16:28,011 --> 02:16:29,980
so that you can't,
you're just starfish out on your back.

3251
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:32,500
And like I was like,
what an asshole.

3252
02:16:32,530 --> 02:16:34,090
Like you know,
he did it on purpose.

3253
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:36,670
Well why does that?
But if it was effective,

3254
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:41,700
why is that more embarrassing?
Just because your legs are all spread 

3255
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:41,700
out

3256
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:42,480
and it looks like a sexual position kind
of,

3257
02:16:42,481 --> 02:16:47,481
you know,
because they're like right on top of 

3258
02:16:47,481 --> 02:16:47,481
you.
Stomach to stomach,

3259
02:16:47,481 --> 02:16:47,481
chest to chest pain.
The Groin.

3260
02:16:47,830 --> 02:16:48,900
Here it is.
Yeah.

3261
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:49,440
That,
that's.

3262
02:16:49,441 --> 02:16:51,120
Yeah,
that's close.

3263
02:16:51,450 --> 02:16:52,310
Well,
that's amount.

3264
02:16:52,830 --> 02:16:56,950
Someone mounting grape vining someone.
Oh,

3265
02:16:57,550 --> 02:16:59,970
it's not really pulling up the one go 
down again.

3266
02:16:59,971 --> 02:17:01,350
The black and white one,
right?

3267
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:03,120
Uh,
yeah,

3268
02:17:03,121 --> 02:17:03,750
there's,
yeah,

3269
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:06,250
that's kind of like basically I'm sort 
of.

3270
02:17:06,260 --> 02:17:07,560
But he's kind of doing more of an 
Armbar.

3271
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:10,640
So just imagine if you had thing amount 
with a double bond.

3272
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:12,300
So it's just kind of,
you know what I mean?

3273
02:17:12,301 --> 02:17:14,750
It was just like demoralizing.
No,

3274
02:17:14,790 --> 02:17:15,950
I get it,
damn it.

3275
02:17:16,370 --> 02:17:21,000
And it was so fast.
But usually actually I didn't get pinned

3276
02:17:21,001 --> 02:17:23,280
on Varsity so it was so flexible because
back to that,

3277
02:17:23,310 --> 02:17:26,300
like people couldn't turn me over.
Even the varsity guys like I would.

3278
02:17:26,340 --> 02:17:31,340
That was my survival technique was like 
my shoulders were so flexible that if 

3279
02:17:31,340 --> 02:17:35,361
like in,
in high school wrestling you can't go 

3280
02:17:35,361 --> 02:17:37,671
past was potentially dangerous.
You're not allowed to like dislocate 

3281
02:17:37,671 --> 02:17:40,221
someone's shoulders,
so it's like they would try to turn me 

3282
02:17:40,221 --> 02:17:40,221
on my shoulder,
my arm,

3283
02:17:40,221 --> 02:17:40,221
it be going,
going,

3284
02:17:40,221 --> 02:17:40,221
going,
going,

3285
02:17:40,221 --> 02:17:40,980
going,
and they were like,

3286
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:43,740
you can't go past that or you're going 
to dislocate your arm,

3287
02:17:43,741 --> 02:17:44,550
you know?
So it was like,

3288
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:46,440
that was my,
my Hail Mary.

3289
02:17:46,441 --> 02:17:48,840
It was like I'm really flexible and I'm 
super tough and I would just,

3290
02:17:48,841 --> 02:17:53,841
would not let.
I would have let my arm dislocate for 

3291
02:17:53,841 --> 02:17:53,841
sure.
I was not going to let him turn me.

3292
02:17:53,841 --> 02:17:53,841
That's totally fine.

3293
02:17:53,841 --> 02:17:55,240
Interesting things about wrestling,
isn't it?

3294
02:17:55,260 --> 02:18:00,260
This is like there's some things that 
you would do in a fight that you're not 

3295
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:00,260
allowed to do.

3296
02:18:00,430 --> 02:18:01,900
Well,
it's collegiate wrestling,

3297
02:18:01,901 --> 02:18:03,580
so it's um,
there's different styles.

3298
02:18:03,581 --> 02:18:06,010
There's collegiate,
which is more safe for schools.

3299
02:18:06,070 --> 02:18:06,850
Yeah.
Because our kids.

3300
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:08,320
And then you get into freestyle 
wrestling,

3301
02:18:08,321 --> 02:18:10,840
which you can throw people in slam and 
collegiate.

3302
02:18:10,841 --> 02:18:15,841
You have to kind of set them down.
You're not allowed to just like pick 

3303
02:18:15,841 --> 02:18:15,841
someone in the article,
boom,

3304
02:18:15,841 --> 02:18:16,150
throw them.
You have to kind of put them down.

3305
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:21,440
But even just freestyle.
I remember when Mark Schultz fought in 

3306
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:22,590
the Olympics and rip that guy's arm 
apart,

3307
02:18:22,650 --> 02:18:25,880
got them into Kamora and sort of tossed 
them with the oranges.

3308
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,670
He yanked his arm backwards.
Yeah,

3309
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:30,060
I mean he,
he got disqualified for that.

3310
02:18:30,660 --> 02:18:32,850
Which we're in the UFC would be an 
amazing move.

3311
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:36,160
Yeah.
Well I guess it's a different mindset.

3312
02:18:36,190 --> 02:18:38,590
I guess they think of wrestling is 
wrestling and fighting is fighting.

3313
02:18:38,650 --> 02:18:39,160
It's different.

3314
02:18:39,830 --> 02:18:44,830
It is,
but it's like it's effective grappling 

3315
02:18:44,830 --> 02:18:45,470
like the use of your body against their 
body.

3316
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:47,650
It's interesting in that way.
It's right.

3317
02:18:47,770 --> 02:18:52,770
Think for wrestling.
I don't know if you're supposed to use 

3318
02:18:52,770 --> 02:18:54,970
like joint manipulation.
I think maybe that's the difference.

3319
02:18:55,180 --> 02:19:00,180
It's supposed to be like that.
You can control their body with your 

3320
02:19:00,180 --> 02:19:01,690
weight on top of them.
Not necessarily like contort their joint

3321
02:19:01,691 --> 02:19:04,600
in the wrong direction so that you know,
that's Jujitsu.

3322
02:19:05,290 --> 02:19:05,890
Jujitsu comes in.

3323
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:10,980
Do you remember when Matt Hughes Fought 
Ricardo Almeida and choked them out,

3324
02:19:12,100 --> 02:19:13,940
but with like a front headlock?
Yeah.

3325
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:17,320
Which is a move that is actually using a
wrestling all the time.

3326
02:19:17,870 --> 02:19:18,940
That was a fascinating.

3327
02:19:18,990 --> 02:19:21,440
Some wrestlers have adapted more of that
stuff too,

3328
02:19:21,450 --> 02:19:26,450
and then they put that in there more 
than one start putting some pressure on 

3329
02:19:26,450 --> 02:19:28,550
the throat and folding people over it 
and they try to get a little bit

3330
02:19:28,690 --> 02:19:32,030
who's so fucking strong when he gets a 
hold of you in that position and he's.

3331
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:34,150
Yeah,
he's pushing against your.

3332
02:19:34,510 --> 02:19:39,510
Your arm and it's pending against your 
neck and then he's squeezing your neck 

3333
02:19:39,510 --> 02:19:39,510
on the other side.
He's choking you out.

3334
02:19:39,510 --> 02:19:41,650
Let's just like a head and arm choke,
but in a reverse position.

3335
02:19:41,770 --> 02:19:42,980
Yeah,
it's pretty good.

3336
02:19:42,981 --> 02:19:47,981
Yeah.
I was amazed when I saw that fight that 

3337
02:19:47,981 --> 02:19:50,971
he did that,
that he was able to choke out Ricardo 

3338
02:19:50,971 --> 02:19:53,210
Tomato who's a Jujitsu black belt,
but Maura may since then that no one 

3339
02:19:53,210 --> 02:19:54,250
else has been able to do it.
Have you wrestled?

3340
02:19:54,280 --> 02:19:55,340
Did you refresh?
I wrestled in high school.

3341
02:19:55,490 --> 02:19:56,940
Wrestle in high school one year.
Yeah.

3342
02:19:56,970 --> 02:19:58,460
It's hard.
The other ones,

3343
02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:00,240
taekwondo,
so it was both.

3344
02:20:00,530 --> 02:20:03,340
Yeah.
I just decided to tag window was easier.

3345
02:20:03,341 --> 02:20:08,341
I liked that and I like kicking people.
It was like the biggest things,

3346
02:20:09,521 --> 02:20:10,420
isn't it?
I was,

3347
02:20:10,690 --> 02:20:13,030
well it was also that I had to do it at 
school,

3348
02:20:13,350 --> 02:20:18,350
so it was like I had to stay at school,
which I fucking hated and I was just a 

3349
02:20:18,350 --> 02:20:20,680
Zombie like after us,
so sore.

3350
02:20:20,710 --> 02:20:24,400
I remember like we used to do the 
sprints upstairs and shit and carry each

3351
02:20:24,401 --> 02:20:27,700
other across the football field and I 
was so fucking sore.

3352
02:20:28,180 --> 02:20:30,510
I just remember thinking like a bark

3353
02:20:32,200 --> 02:20:37,200
used to do like what they call the gut 
busters I think because it literally 

3354
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:39,040
makes me want to vomit.
I was doing both at the same time too.

3355
02:20:39,050 --> 02:20:41,390
I was doing taekwondo and wrestling at 
the same time.

3356
02:20:41,870 --> 02:20:46,870
I just had determined I wish I could've 
done more extra curricular like school 

3357
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:49,160
activities besides just what was offered
by the school.

3358
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:53,150
That was one thing is like we were so we
struggled a lot financially growing up.

3359
02:20:53,210 --> 02:20:57,410
We didn't grow up in a privileged 
household by any means and they couldn't

3360
02:20:57,411 --> 02:21:02,411
afford.
My parents couldn't afford to put me 

3361
02:21:02,411 --> 02:21:02,411
into gymnastics at a time,
you know,

3362
02:21:02,411 --> 02:21:04,130
but I'm glad because I think that for 
it,

3363
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:09,160
that's what I wanted to do.
I actually wanted to do gymnastics 

3364
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:09,160
instead of wrestling,
but they're like,

3365
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:09,160
you know,
we just,

3366
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:10,380
it's too,
too much and,

3367
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:16,960
but I'm glad that I didn't come from 
super privileged because it just gives 

3368
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:16,960
me a whole different perspective.

3369
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:18,710
Sure.
You appreciate what you've earned,

3370
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:20,990
I'm sure.
When did you start striking?

3371
02:21:20,991 --> 02:21:24,110
When did you do any sort of striking 
martial arts?

3372
02:21:25,220 --> 02:21:26,480
Nineteen.
I was 19.

3373
02:21:26,820 --> 02:21:28,900
When did you start out with?
Um,

3374
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:30,890
I think it was just kickboxing.
Yeah,

3375
02:21:30,891 --> 02:21:33,260
just normal,
like learning to throw kicks and normal,

3376
02:21:33,530 --> 02:21:35,480
you know,
it was kickboxing for mma.

3377
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:36,770
I never did any,
like,

3378
02:21:36,771 --> 02:21:39,140
just straight anything.
It was always about,

3379
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:41,390
it was always about mma and obviously I 
wrestled.

3380
02:21:41,391 --> 02:21:44,390
So the goal was always to grab people 
and get them to the ground.

3381
02:21:44,460 --> 02:21:46,040
Right.
So yeah,

3382
02:21:46,041 --> 02:21:48,230
I started with kickboxing,
learning how to throw basic kicks,

3383
02:21:48,231 --> 02:21:50,000
learning how to throw basic punches,
but like,

3384
02:21:50,030 --> 02:21:55,030
but before my first fight,
I think I had like maybe four weeks of 

3385
02:21:55,030 --> 02:21:55,400
striking,
which is like nothing.

3386
02:21:56,390 --> 02:21:59,330
Nothing that's crazy.
It was crazy.

3387
02:21:59,740 --> 02:22:00,120
Well,

3388
02:22:00,460 --> 02:22:04,960
in those situations where I had a buddy 
of mine who was a Jujitsu black belt,

3389
02:22:05,050 --> 02:22:10,050
really high level Jujitsu guy and he's 
taken an mma fight and we had a 

3390
02:22:10,050 --> 02:22:12,790
conversation about it before and uh,
I was going,

3391
02:22:12,820 --> 02:22:14,830
well,
how much striking are you doing?

3392
02:22:15,130 --> 02:22:17,380
And he's like once a week or get 
together and do this.

3393
02:22:17,381 --> 02:22:18,520
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

3394
02:22:18,550 --> 02:22:19,270
I'm like,
listen,

3395
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:21,640
do you know what you can do to guys on 
the ground?

3396
02:22:22,180 --> 02:22:23,170
Well,
someone can do that.

3397
02:22:23,171 --> 02:22:26,070
Do you standing up and evolve?
That guy has to do

3398
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:29,970
is keep you from getting a hold of him 
and your Foxville like you have to.

3399
02:22:29,971 --> 02:22:34,110
You have to be understanding that like 
there's a difference in the consequences

3400
02:22:34,111 --> 02:22:39,111
as well because the consequences of 
being in there with like a dangerous 

3401
02:22:39,111 --> 02:22:43,071
striker or one wrong move and you get 
clipped with something and you wake up.

3402
02:22:44,370 --> 02:22:46,350
It's just,
it's such a different thing.

3403
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:49,290
But so many people that are really good 
at one thing,

3404
02:22:49,470 --> 02:22:53,250
they think all I have to do is do my one
thing and they won't be able to stop me.

3405
02:22:53,450 --> 02:22:54,200
Right?
Well,

3406
02:22:54,320 --> 02:22:56,720
I went into my first fight,
kind of ignorance is bliss,

3407
02:22:56,721 --> 02:22:58,310
to not,
not thinking like,

3408
02:22:58,670 --> 02:23:00,440
you know,
if I can't do this because I just didn't

3409
02:23:00,441 --> 02:23:05,441
know how devastating it could be to get 
like kneed in the face now up in 

3410
02:23:06,561 --> 02:23:11,561
Washington state,
they don't allow amateurs like to throw 

3411
02:23:11,561 --> 02:23:11,561
a full on,
nice the face.

3412
02:23:11,561 --> 02:23:15,220
I don't know,
they don't allow it like an amateur 

3413
02:23:15,220 --> 02:23:17,561
fighting I think in California and stuff
like that to like now there's more 

3414
02:23:17,561 --> 02:23:20,321
regulations and they don't allow it just
because a lot of times and amateurs are 

3415
02:23:20,321 --> 02:23:21,290
still learning and just such a brutal 
blow,

3416
02:23:21,490 --> 02:23:23,010
right.
The need of the face like we are.

3417
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:25,250
I mean that's a hard.
There is no protection.

3418
02:23:25,251 --> 02:23:28,430
It straight like kneebone and that's 
pretty brutal.

3419
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:30,950
Um,
my first fight,

3420
02:23:31,130 --> 02:23:32,210
oh my gosh,
you know,

3421
02:23:32,211 --> 02:23:33,590
I went out there,
I wrestled her.

3422
02:23:33,591 --> 02:23:35,150
I pretty much just all that's all that I
knew.

3423
02:23:35,150 --> 02:23:36,770
I don't even think I threw a punch on 
the ground.

3424
02:23:36,830 --> 02:23:41,830
Like,
I took her down like the easiest I've 

3425
02:23:41,830 --> 02:23:41,830
ever take her down and I think I forgot 
that I could punch because I was just,

3426
02:23:41,930 --> 02:23:44,570
that's all I knew is wrestling.
So just wrestled her the whole time.

3427
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:50,060
And then the second round I came out and
threw a once you went to and I try to 

3428
02:23:50,060 --> 02:23:50,630
grab a hold of her and she put me in a 
Thai clinch.

3429
02:23:50,780 --> 02:23:52,130
So her and her husband own the,
uh,

3430
02:23:52,131 --> 02:23:52,570
like,
uh,

3431
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:57,640
owned a Thai school up in Canada.
So she was like really good striker,

3432
02:23:57,710 --> 02:24:02,710
no wrestling or really much grappling a 
little bit and I didn't know what it 

3433
02:24:02,710 --> 02:24:06,401
was.
I didn't even know what a Thai clinch 

3434
02:24:06,401 --> 02:24:06,401
was,
as much less how to defend it.

3435
02:24:06,401 --> 02:24:09,940
So she just starts kneeing my face off 
and the only thing I can think to do is 

3436
02:24:09,940 --> 02:24:09,940
shoot.

3437
02:24:09,940 --> 02:24:12,230
So I'm just shooting into knees,
is it Bam,

3438
02:24:12,231 --> 02:24:13,070
Bam,
Bam.

3439
02:24:13,130 --> 02:24:15,350
And they're like,
one of them caught my nose is clean on,

3440
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:20,150
busted it flattened my nose.
And um,

3441
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:22,390
that was in such shock.
And she,

3442
02:24:22,430 --> 02:24:27,430
you know,
because is the first time I've been hit 

3443
02:24:27,430 --> 02:24:27,430
really,
like you don't,

3444
02:24:27,430 --> 02:24:30,070
you know,
you don't take blows to the face in 

3445
02:24:30,070 --> 02:24:30,070
wrestling.
So I'm just like,

3446
02:24:30,070 --> 02:24:31,160
Whoa,
what is going on here,

3447
02:24:31,161 --> 02:24:34,690
what am I doing?
And she kind of like pushes me down like

3448
02:24:35,030 --> 02:24:37,360
because I'm so shooting,
but I kinda like slump out of the,

3449
02:24:37,361 --> 02:24:37,980
uh,
you know,

3450
02:24:38,060 --> 02:24:40,430
off of the legs a little bit.
I'm a little bit stunned obviously.

3451
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:45,200
And she spins around and takes my bag.
She tried to choke me and I just,

3452
02:24:45,260 --> 02:24:48,800
I remember I had this epiphany moment.
It was like the world stopped,

3453
02:24:48,801 --> 02:24:53,801
you know,
and she's still trying to like fight me 

3454
02:24:53,801 --> 02:24:53,801
and beat me up.
But I remember she tried to choke me and

3455
02:24:53,801 --> 02:24:57,731
I had my hands like this and it's such a
vivid moment because how I got this 

3456
02:24:57,731 --> 02:24:58,050
star,
this is how I started my career.

3457
02:24:58,051 --> 02:25:03,051
It was my first fight ever.
And I'm watching this pool of blood and 

3458
02:25:04,821 --> 02:25:06,710
there's a steady stream,
like not even dripping,

3459
02:25:06,711 --> 02:25:10,520
like it's just pouring out of my nose 
and this pool of blood is getting bigger

3460
02:25:10,580 --> 02:25:15,580
and bigger and bigger.
And she's still trying to choke me and 

3461
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:16,400
punched me and I'm thinking like,
this bitch,

3462
02:25:23,890 --> 02:25:24,130
that's

3463
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:26,740
exactly what the hell.
No.

3464
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:29,440
And I got pissed.
I got pissed.

3465
02:25:29,441 --> 02:25:34,441
I lost my temper and the fight.
I started bucking her off and that's 

3466
02:25:34,441 --> 02:25:38,401
when the fight,
it really came out of me because before 

3467
02:25:38,401 --> 02:25:38,401
that I was just,
I was so wrestling.

3468
02:25:38,401 --> 02:25:38,401
I was like,
you know,

3469
02:25:38,401 --> 02:25:40,840
competing.
That's when the fighter came out.

3470
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:43,480
I got fucking pissed.
I was pissed.

3471
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:44,950
Not only that,
my nose was broken.

3472
02:25:44,951 --> 02:25:48,490
Not only that I got hit,
but that she had my back.

3473
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:50,740
That was like,
that was what pissed me off.

3474
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:52,270
Like the rest was kind of like,
Eh,

3475
02:25:52,271 --> 02:25:54,580
you know,
but I was the wrestler.

3476
02:25:54,940 --> 02:25:59,940
Fuck you,
like get off my back like you're the 

3477
02:25:59,940 --> 02:25:59,940
striker,
you're not allowed to be there.

3478
02:25:59,940 --> 02:26:04,200
So I like started bugging her and she 
fell down into the guard position and I 

3479
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:09,001
stood up above her and I reached to the 
ceiling as high as I could and I just 

3480
02:26:09,001 --> 02:26:11,020
started raining down punches from the 
standing position.

3481
02:26:11,020 --> 02:26:14,080
And the lead is going everywhere.
Like she soaked in it.

3482
02:26:14,081 --> 02:26:19,081
I've got it all over me,
I'm just bleeding like a stuck pig 

3483
02:26:19,081 --> 02:26:20,500
everywhere and I remember her face Kinda
like wincing,

3484
02:26:20,501 --> 02:26:25,501
like trying to weather the storm and 
that's the how the second round ended 

3485
02:26:25,501 --> 02:26:27,070
and then I went back to my corner and 
like I'm the head,

3486
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:32,280
the head coach was like,
we can't let you go back out for the 

3487
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:33,370
third round because your nose is just so
like we don't know how bad it is.

3488
02:26:33,371 --> 02:26:36,460
And I was super bummed because that was 
the turning point in the fight for me.

3489
02:26:36,461 --> 02:26:41,461
That's when it actually became a fight 
and I was like I really wanted to go 

3490
02:26:41,461 --> 02:26:43,000
back out in the third round and just 
whip this girl's ass.

3491
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:48,640
So you lost the fight but you learned a 
lot about yourself?

3492
02:26:48,700 --> 02:26:50,050
Yeah,
the ton.

3493
02:26:50,290 --> 02:26:51,190
And I had to go home.

3494
02:26:51,190 --> 02:26:53,410
That's bringing this back full circle.
This is where my,

3495
02:26:53,500 --> 02:26:56,620
my very chauvinistic grandpa at the 
time,

3496
02:26:56,790 --> 02:26:58,720
but you know,
was kind of sexy super old school.

3497
02:26:58,750 --> 02:26:59,350
Like he was like,
you know,

3498
02:26:59,351 --> 02:27:01,520
women do this and men do that.
Women don't do this.

3499
02:27:01,521 --> 02:27:03,400
So you're not allowed to do that.
And what are you doing?

3500
02:27:03,630 --> 02:27:06,370
I had to come home.
Oh my God,

3501
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:11,400
that was the most dreadful drive I ever 
had because my nose was literally like 

3502
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:14,500
three times this size.
I had no definition between my,

3503
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:16,990
the bridge of my nose and my cheekbones.
Like it just went straight out.

3504
02:27:16,991 --> 02:27:20,150
It was flat like a lion and then it just
went straight up to my cheek bones.

3505
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:25,200
That's how bad it was.
I mean it got broken bat and then over 

3506
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:28,621
like the next night,
like I could barely even open my eyes 

3507
02:27:28,621 --> 02:27:30,220
and I had two giant black raccoon eyes.

3508
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:33,580
So it was like,
there's no hiding it.

3509
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:36,670
Like you get to look your grandpa 
straight in the face and he's like,

3510
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,620
risk.
I told you,

3511
02:27:38,621 --> 02:27:39,280
you know,
and you're just like,

3512
02:27:40,570 --> 02:27:41,980
oh yeah,
oh man.

3513
02:27:41,981 --> 02:27:43,120
He was just like that,
you know,

3514
02:27:43,210 --> 02:27:46,600
he just wouldn't like would not lay off 
of it was,

3515
02:27:46,601 --> 02:27:49,810
this is why you shouldn't be doing this.
This is absurd.

3516
02:27:50,410 --> 02:27:52,990
This is ridiculous.
This is embarrassing.

3517
02:27:52,991 --> 02:27:54,800
And my dad's just like,
you know,

3518
02:27:54,990 --> 02:27:57,430
he's so embarrassed.
Like he was just.

3519
02:27:57,431 --> 02:27:58,390
Yeah,
he was embarrassed.

3520
02:27:58,420 --> 02:28:03,420
And I'm in the back of my mind,
I know that I can't say anything at the 

3521
02:28:03,420 --> 02:28:06,451
moment,
but in the back of my mind I was 

3522
02:28:06,451 --> 02:28:07,300
thinking,
I'm not done.

3523
02:28:07,660 --> 02:28:12,660
I've got to do this again.
Like in the back of my mind I was 

3524
02:28:12,660 --> 02:28:12,660
thinking because everyone was like,
well good.

3525
02:28:12,660 --> 02:28:13,870
She good thing she got that out of her 
system.

3526
02:28:13,871 --> 02:28:16,000
Like she'll,
she'll surely never do that again.

3527
02:28:16,330 --> 02:28:21,330
Thank God she got this.
She learned her lesson early and I was 

3528
02:28:21,330 --> 02:28:21,330
thinking,
I was like,

3529
02:28:21,330 --> 02:28:22,130
I can't,
I've got

3530
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:27,130
to get back in.
They're going to prove that I can do 

3531
02:28:27,130 --> 02:28:27,130
better than that was like,
it was too embarrassing.

3532
02:28:27,130 --> 02:28:31,640
I'd have to face every one that was 
telling me like I shouldn't be doing 

3533
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:34,271
that.
And you know what everyone says to you 

3534
02:28:34,271 --> 02:28:36,011
like before you like,
but at least back then everyone would 

3535
02:28:36,011 --> 02:28:37,010
say to me,
don't break your nose.

3536
02:28:40,950 --> 02:28:43,410
That was like my pre,
like good luck,

3537
02:28:43,440 --> 02:28:44,730
you know,
like people say like,

3538
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:45,640
oh,
go kill it.

3539
02:28:45,641 --> 02:28:46,980
That meaning break a leg,
you know,

3540
02:28:47,010 --> 02:28:48,150
people like the other way,
like,

3541
02:28:48,690 --> 02:28:49,440
well,
you know,

3542
02:28:49,470 --> 02:28:51,540
good luck in your fight.
Don't break your nose.

3543
02:28:52,410 --> 02:28:56,460
Fuck,
no,

3544
02:28:56,461 --> 02:28:58,050
you know,
it was so embarrassing.

3545
02:28:58,051 --> 02:29:01,590
I think I missed like a week of call,
a week of classes too because I had done

3546
02:29:01,591 --> 02:29:03,930
it over like a break so I had like,
I dunno it,

3547
02:29:03,970 --> 02:29:05,730
like winter break or something and then 
I,

3548
02:29:05,780 --> 02:29:08,130
I missed like a week because it was 
still so bad.

3549
02:29:09,560 --> 02:29:11,580
Did you have to get it fixed?
No,

3550
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:14,100
I probably should have.
It's still not fixed,

3551
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:19,160
but you can feel it.
It's like you can fill the 

3552
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:19,410
disassociated.
My septum is like,

3553
02:29:20,150 --> 02:29:24,740
it's not very well to be honest about 
the right side.

3554
02:29:24,750 --> 02:29:28,400
Like I can barely.
And this is a good day.

3555
02:29:28,490 --> 02:29:30,320
Have you ever had thought about having 
it fixed?

3556
02:29:30,321 --> 02:29:32,360
Yeah,
I have,

3557
02:29:32,390 --> 02:29:33,610
I have,
but um,

3558
02:29:33,830 --> 02:29:38,830
yeah,
hopefully one of these days I just did 

3559
02:29:38,830 --> 02:29:38,830
it recently.
Helped him a lot.

3560
02:29:38,830 --> 02:29:38,830
Yeah.
Yeah,

3561
02:29:38,830 --> 02:29:43,600
I did it.
I didn't do it till I was 39 my whole 

3562
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:43,600
life.
I had a fucked up now.

3563
02:29:43,860 --> 02:29:44,750
Oh,
that's amazing.

3564
02:29:45,250 --> 02:29:47,990
Sound really nasally now to listen to 
myself.

3565
02:29:47,991 --> 02:29:49,400
Like I'll probably go back and listen to
podcasts.

3566
02:29:49,401 --> 02:29:50,510
Like God,
I sound nasally.

3567
02:29:51,470 --> 02:29:52,880
I used to be just like you.
I'll be like,

3568
02:29:53,930 --> 02:29:57,440
one side was like three quarters closed.
The other side was totally useless.

3569
02:29:57,590 --> 02:30:00,710
I had no breathing out of my nose.
It was just all fucked up in there.

3570
02:30:00,711 --> 02:30:02,360
But now it's like,
yeah,

3571
02:30:02,630 --> 02:30:03,920
and then.
But yeah.

3572
02:30:03,921 --> 02:30:05,120
That's nice.
I'm jealous.

3573
02:30:05,180 --> 02:30:07,970
Wait a rabbit and Joe,
but you could get it fixed.

3574
02:30:08,610 --> 02:30:09,920
Yeah.
But then I was wondering like,

3575
02:30:09,950 --> 02:30:12,400
don't they have to like shave it down?
They're like,

3576
02:30:12,460 --> 02:30:13,340
no,
it's inside.

3577
02:30:13,341 --> 02:30:18,341
Straighten it.
It's like open up the like they opened 

3578
02:30:18,341 --> 02:30:20,450
it up but then it makes it a little bit 
weaker or something to get broken again.

3579
02:30:20,630 --> 02:30:22,010
No,
I don't think so.

3580
02:30:22,070 --> 02:30:23,310
You know,
I think we'll,

3581
02:30:23,420 --> 02:30:26,360
they shaved down the turbinates.
The inside,

3582
02:30:26,361 --> 02:30:31,361
like there's these bumps inside your 
nose that hinders the opening or the 

3583
02:30:31,671 --> 02:30:33,560
opening smaller.
They shaved that down,

3584
02:30:33,561 --> 02:30:36,730
they cut out the inside.
That's all calcified too for me,

3585
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:40,280
which is like cauliflower,
cauliflower ear.

3586
02:30:40,281 --> 02:30:45,281
You get that in your nose as well.
I feel like I'm asking for it to get 

3587
02:30:45,281 --> 02:30:45,470
broken again though.
As soon as I fix it.

3588
02:30:45,590 --> 02:30:47,780
Like it says like it's gonna get broken 
again probably anyway.

3589
02:30:47,781 --> 02:30:48,980
Right.
If you keep fighting,

3590
02:30:49,190 --> 02:30:54,190
but I think that like at least you have 
more of an opportunity to breathe and 

3591
02:30:54,190 --> 02:30:54,190
your cardio will definitely improve.

3592
02:30:54,490 --> 02:30:56,330
That's what they have heard about cardio
already.

3593
02:30:57,050 --> 02:31:02,050
If you breathe out of your nose,
I'm sure it would help you in a lot of 

3594
02:31:02,050 --> 02:31:02,090
ways.
I have to look into it.

3595
02:31:02,260 --> 02:31:02,860
Yeah,
I mean,

3596
02:31:03,890 --> 02:31:06,370
so like when I was a kid,
um,

3597
02:31:06,620 --> 02:31:11,620
I went to a doctor like when I was 19 or
20 and I had a real problem with it and 

3598
02:31:11,620 --> 02:31:11,840
the doctor said,
look,

3599
02:31:12,170 --> 02:31:15,530
unless you stop fighting,
you need to just deal with this and then

3600
02:31:15,531 --> 02:31:20,531
once you're done competing then do it.
And I just left it alone but that snore 

3601
02:31:20,581 --> 02:31:22,890
really bad and I want to take yoga 
class.

3602
02:31:22,891 --> 02:31:25,890
I couldn't breathe out of my nose and 
finally I just bit the bullet.

3603
02:31:25,891 --> 02:31:30,891
But after I did it,
I made a youtube video about it because 

3604
02:31:30,891 --> 02:31:30,891
I'm like,
oh my God,

3605
02:31:30,891 --> 02:31:31,680
all these people saying that.
It was like really bad.

3606
02:31:32,010 --> 02:31:32,730
Like fuck.

3607
02:31:32,730 --> 02:31:34,650
It's nothing,
it's nothing.

3608
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:37,970
The iteration was nothing.
What did they like to do?

3609
02:31:37,971 --> 02:31:39,180
Put you under?
Yeah,

3610
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:40,950
but when it's over,
like everybody's like,

3611
02:31:40,951 --> 02:31:42,450
oh my God,
it's so awful.

3612
02:31:42,451 --> 02:31:44,430
You're miserable.
Break your nose.

3613
02:31:44,550 --> 02:31:48,130
They definitely get in there.
They like break it and reset it though.

3614
02:31:48,140 --> 02:31:53,140
Anything.
Now it's broken up here like you could 

3615
02:31:53,140 --> 02:31:53,140
feel like it's all.
Where was.

3616
02:31:53,140 --> 02:31:55,780
I broke it when I was five was the first
time I broke it.

3617
02:31:56,230 --> 02:31:57,930
I broke it.
Who knows how many times after that,

3618
02:31:57,931 --> 02:32:00,840
but the inside was where it was all 
fucked up.

3619
02:32:00,870 --> 02:32:05,870
It was just.
And he said it was one of the worst 

3620
02:32:05,870 --> 02:32:05,870
you've ever seen.
He's like,

3621
02:32:05,870 --> 02:32:05,870
boy,
this thing has been broken a lot.

3622
02:32:05,870 --> 02:32:07,620
Said I don't know how many times you 
broke and I'm like,

3623
02:32:07,621 --> 02:32:09,190
I don't know either,
but I mean a.

3624
02:32:09,210 --> 02:32:11,830
compare my nose though to like vandelay.

3625
02:32:12,310 --> 02:32:17,310
You remember when Vandelay vandelays one
of those guys where if you look at 

3626
02:32:17,310 --> 02:32:19,450
vandelays first fight everything.
Yep.

3627
02:32:19,730 --> 02:32:22,980
So he had to get his.
He does Nick Diaz,

3628
02:32:23,010 --> 02:32:28,010
Nick Diaz,
bone shaved down and he had scar tissue 

3629
02:32:28,010 --> 02:32:28,010
removed.
But with Vandelay,

3630
02:32:28,010 --> 02:32:32,540
he probably had that done too,
but he had a bunch of scar tissue 

3631
02:32:32,540 --> 02:32:36,151
removed because he had so much scar 
tissue that his eyes were drooping like 

3632
02:32:36,151 --> 02:32:39,120
severely and his nose was flat.
I mean just flatten.

3633
02:32:39,150 --> 02:32:44,150
There was nothing left.
So he had a piece of cartilage removed 

3634
02:32:44,150 --> 02:32:47,331
from his rib and then they redid his 
nose and he had his nose made big so 

3635
02:32:47,491 --> 02:32:52,491
that he could breathe out of it better.
Like he like had the license while he 

3636
02:32:52,491 --> 02:32:52,491
was still fighting.
Oh yeah.

3637
02:32:52,670 --> 02:32:54,930
Do you remember when he fought in the 
UFC?

3638
02:32:55,050 --> 02:32:57,930
He looked one way.
I fought chuck and then like he,

3639
02:32:58,050 --> 02:33:00,180
he looked like a completely different 
person.

3640
02:33:00,650 --> 02:33:05,650
I didn't even notice the nose because I 
was so focused on like the bone 

3641
02:33:05,650 --> 02:33:05,790
structure.
Like I feel like that maybe he had a lot

3642
02:33:05,791 --> 02:33:06,420
done.
Yeah,

3643
02:33:07,590 --> 02:33:11,580
he's crazy too.
I've traded as Jim before madman.

3644
02:33:11,620 --> 02:33:14,880
He's like,
all all Alec tries to kill people.

3645
02:33:14,940 --> 02:33:15,600
Yeah.
No,

3646
02:33:15,601 --> 02:33:20,601
he finds there.
There's no sparring with vandelay 

3647
02:33:20,601 --> 02:33:20,601
fighting.
Yeah.

3648
02:33:20,601 --> 02:33:21,780
I've talked to people that spar with 
them and they were like,

3649
02:33:21,781 --> 02:33:24,570
what in the fuck?
He just kills people.

3650
02:33:24,950 --> 02:33:29,060
Like no mercy.
Like give me mark mark,

3651
02:33:29,390 --> 02:33:34,390
that's just.
Well that was like more of a Russian 

3652
02:33:34,390 --> 02:33:34,390
accent.
That's not what he sounds like it,

3653
02:33:34,390 --> 02:33:37,600
but it was like mean like that.
I'm here to fight and there we go.

3654
02:33:40,410 --> 02:33:45,410
Just making really mean until like,
like he's chewing through his training 

3655
02:33:45,410 --> 02:33:45,410
partners.
That's what it was like.

3656
02:33:45,410 --> 02:33:47,310
That guy got fucked over.
He really did.

3657
02:33:47,311 --> 02:33:52,311
I was so upset with when they tried to 
give him a lifetime ban and you know 

3658
02:33:52,311 --> 02:33:56,570
what,
what they did was really wrong and sent 

3659
02:33:56,570 --> 02:33:57,180
him on his tail tailspin.
Then he sent a bunch of crazy shit about

3660
02:33:57,181 --> 02:34:02,181
the UFC and it's like that.
The whole thing made me really sad 

3661
02:34:02,181 --> 02:34:02,850
because they were trying to make an 
example out of him.

3662
02:34:02,851 --> 02:34:05,730
But look,
that guy never failed a drug test.

3663
02:34:06,270 --> 02:34:07,860
I don't know who the fuck knows what he 
was doing.

3664
02:34:07,950 --> 02:34:11,250
He definitely did some shit,
especially in pride for 100 percent.

3665
02:34:11,570 --> 02:34:14,100
I mean when he fought cro cop,
he was 218 pounds,

3666
02:34:14,550 --> 02:34:15,960
you know,
that's not from creatine.

3667
02:34:16,250 --> 02:34:18,010
He did some shit 100 percent right,

3668
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:21,640
but back then you were allowed to do 
whatever you want in the UFC.

3669
02:34:21,820 --> 02:34:23,470
He never pissed hot.
He never got caught.

3670
02:34:23,650 --> 02:34:28,650
So to have this one time where he ran 
away from a drug test and to say that 

3671
02:34:28,871 --> 02:34:30,880
he's banned for life,
so ridiculous.

3672
02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:35,960
It was just a total abuse of power and a
really callous abuse by these people 

3673
02:34:36,911 --> 02:34:41,911
that are a part of the commission 
because they are responsible for this 

3674
02:34:41,911 --> 02:34:46,171
guy's livelihood and they just decided 
to treat him as an example and not 

3675
02:34:46,171 --> 02:34:49,921
respect him as a pioneer of the sport.
What my thought is you should treat him 

3676
02:34:51,011 --> 02:34:53,830
as if he pissed hot.
Look you randomly from a test,

3677
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:55,780
guess what?
You're automatically pits and hot.

3678
02:34:55,781 --> 02:34:59,530
So it would be like nine months and 
instead they said life.

3679
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:01,630
And I'm like,
that is crazy.

3680
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:04,370
You can't take away a man's livelihood.
No.

3681
02:35:04,390 --> 02:35:05,380
He would've been better if he.

3682
02:35:05,540 --> 02:35:10,540
Yeah,
like if he would've pissed hot 

3683
02:35:10,540 --> 02:35:10,540
technically yes,
but much better.

3684
02:35:10,540 --> 02:35:10,930
Yeah,
much better.

3685
02:35:10,931 --> 02:35:15,931
If you had been back fighting already,
he'd be already scheduled right now in 

3686
02:35:15,931 --> 02:35:19,441
the UFC.
He probably be still in the UFC and 

3687
02:35:19,441 --> 02:35:21,991
still fighting and now I guess he's 
going to fight for Bella tour and he's 

3688
02:35:21,991 --> 02:35:24,850
got a fight overseas because they 
reduced to suspension to like,

3689
02:35:24,851 --> 02:35:29,851
I think they gave him a couple of years 
or something like that or maybe even 

3690
02:35:29,851 --> 02:35:30,080
less,
but the time,

3691
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:34,660
a fight career that I can,
especially when you're 38 as it is,

3692
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:36,520
we want to see 38.
He's got to be right.

3693
02:35:36,670 --> 02:35:37,690
Thirty seven,
38.

3694
02:35:38,470 --> 02:35:42,160
It's um,
it's so weird too because the trt thing,

3695
02:35:42,161 --> 02:35:47,161
which was around for quite a few years 
and you saw the rejuvenation of Vituro 

3696
02:35:47,161 --> 02:35:49,120
and Dan Henderson,
these guys that were on trt,

3697
02:35:49,121 --> 02:35:52,550
that all of a sudden started doing 
really well again and just,

3698
02:35:52,990 --> 02:35:54,820
it's such a gray area like.

3699
02:35:55,100 --> 02:35:57,630
And then that's,
that gets removed and then like a,

3700
02:35:57,680 --> 02:36:01,120
everybody's got to go back to your 
normal hormone secretion.

3701
02:36:01,530 --> 02:36:02,030
Like,
oh,

3702
02:36:02,440 --> 02:36:04,230
what do you,
how do you feel about the band?

3703
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:06,530
I don't like it.
Yeah,

3704
02:36:06,970 --> 02:36:07,600
I don't.
Well,

3705
02:36:07,601 --> 02:36:09,600
I don't like weigh ins.
This is,

3706
02:36:09,601 --> 02:36:14,601
this is what I feel like.
I feel like we have to move away from 

3707
02:36:14,601 --> 02:36:17,731
this weight cutting thing because 
there's a difference between this sport 

3708
02:36:17,731 --> 02:36:20,791
in any sport other than boxing and I 
think that the head trauma aspect of it 

3709
02:36:21,251 --> 02:36:24,160
makes wayans 24 hours a day.
Extremely problematic.

3710
02:36:24,161 --> 02:36:26,410
When we understand the science of 
rehydrating,

3711
02:36:26,411 --> 02:36:28,900
the brain can take as much as 70 plus 
hours,

3712
02:36:29,410 --> 02:36:32,380
so that to me says that we're doing a 
bad thing.

3713
02:36:32,650 --> 02:36:35,920
We were doing this silly thing and we're
letting fighters compete.

3714
02:36:35,921 --> 02:36:40,921
Compromise.
I think if someone like you and someone 

3715
02:36:40,921 --> 02:36:41,050
like holly,
you are a similar size.

3716
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:44,650
I think you guys should make an 
agreement and the UFC should say,

3717
02:36:44,651 --> 02:36:45,180
okay,
look,

3718
02:36:45,181 --> 02:36:46,360
Neesha,
what do you weigh right now?

3719
02:36:46,361 --> 02:36:48,610
You wait like 1:46
when you're in peak condition.

3720
02:36:48,611 --> 02:36:49,540
What do you weigh?
A One?

3721
02:36:49,541 --> 02:36:51,130
40 three.
Holly,

3722
02:36:51,220 --> 02:36:53,170
are you cool with 1:43?
Yeah.

3723
02:36:53,171 --> 02:36:55,660
Okay.
Well let's just way you guys during camp

3724
02:36:55,750 --> 02:37:00,750
will weigh you guys sporadically and 
we'll give you a couple of pounds to 

3725
02:37:00,750 --> 02:37:04,141
play with because realistically the 
difference between a 143 pound person 

3726
02:37:04,141 --> 02:37:06,100
and 145 pound person is nothing.
It's just,

3727
02:37:06,300 --> 02:37:07,480
it's,
it's not,

3728
02:37:07,481 --> 02:37:10,150
it's not enough,
and as long as no one's dehydrated.

3729
02:37:10,151 --> 02:37:13,090
Let's take hydration level.
Interesting concept though,

3730
02:37:13,091 --> 02:37:16,160
but think about this for minute 
wrestling week classes typically

3731
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:19,820
are typically about five pounds apart,
so you get into the bigger ones.

3732
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:25,150
So in theory five pounds makes a big 
difference if when you're talking about 

3733
02:37:25,150 --> 02:37:27,620
manipulating someone else's weight 
because you're five pounds less,

3734
02:37:27,740 --> 02:37:30,620
but they're five pounds more,
so it's almost like if you think about a

3735
02:37:30,621 --> 02:37:35,621
double,
like in my mind it's almost like a 

3736
02:37:35,621 --> 02:37:37,730
double five pounds can be a lot if 
there's a lot of wrestling striking.

3737
02:37:37,731 --> 02:37:39,350
I don't think it's doesn't mean 
anything.

3738
02:37:39,351 --> 02:37:44,351
Jujitsu maybe not as much,
but maybe getting someone to the ground 

3739
02:37:44,351 --> 02:37:46,130
or being able to sweep someone.
I mean the commander sound like a lot.

3740
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:48,170
It depends how.
Yeah,

3741
02:37:48,171 --> 02:37:53,171
it depends how big you are.
Five pounds to a 300 pound person isn't 

3742
02:37:53,171 --> 02:37:53,171
that much?
Five pounds to 100.

3743
02:37:53,171 --> 02:37:58,030
15 pound version is a lot.
It's a bigger percentage of their body 

3744
02:37:58,030 --> 02:37:58,030
weight.
That's a big point.

3745
02:37:58,030 --> 02:37:59,690
Like when you're talking about like a 
straw weight or something like that.

3746
02:37:59,691 --> 02:38:02,690
That's a great point.
And I think actually I think holly walks

3747
02:38:02,691 --> 02:38:04,730
around like someone 60 something.
Does she,

3748
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:08,120
she's pretty big girl.
Well I just feel like she is.

3749
02:38:08,480 --> 02:38:10,100
Yeah,
you could tell she,

3750
02:38:10,110 --> 02:38:15,110
I really feel like there's gotta be a 
better way to organize weight classes 

3751
02:38:15,470 --> 02:38:20,470
and I just don't know if forcing someone
like holly to compromise your body to 

3752
02:38:20,470 --> 02:38:23,750
get down to 1:35
and then rehydrate up to like 1:50

3753
02:38:23,751 --> 02:38:24,590
or whatever she does

3754
02:38:25,420 --> 02:38:29,720
came into to the whole play because of 
like bedding me,

3755
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:31,200
like back in the day,
that's what they would like.

3756
02:38:31,210 --> 02:38:33,790
Want to show off the fighters and get 
people to bet on him.

3757
02:38:33,820 --> 02:38:36,280
Like who do you think's gonna win.
So it was kind of like more of a showing

3758
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:39,640
than really like a way in like look how 
big this guy is.

3759
02:38:39,641 --> 02:38:41,500
He weighs this much and look how big 
this one.

3760
02:38:41,501 --> 02:38:46,501
Which one do you think's gonna win?
And they would get people to bet and 

3761
02:38:46,501 --> 02:38:48,090
that's Kinda how wins came about the day
before.

3762
02:38:48,100 --> 02:38:53,100
Try to try to get people interested in 
the fights instead of to both the 

3763
02:38:53,100 --> 02:38:53,100
fighters.
Yeah.

3764
02:38:53,100 --> 02:38:57,150
Well,
it's their shirts off and get them on a 

3765
02:38:57,150 --> 02:38:57,150
scale and show how,
you know,

3766
02:38:57,150 --> 02:38:57,150
we'll,
you know,

3767
02:38:57,150 --> 02:38:58,090
the size difference or whatever,
you know.

3768
02:38:58,140 --> 02:39:00,010
So it didn't.
They used to do the day of the fight.

3769
02:39:00,190 --> 02:39:01,420
I don't know,
maybe.

3770
02:39:01,450 --> 02:39:04,330
I'm not sure about boxing.
It was the day of the fight.

3771
02:39:04,530 --> 02:39:09,530
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure though that that's like 

3772
02:39:09,530 --> 02:39:11,460
where that kind of came in and then I 
think they started making more weight 

3773
02:39:11,460 --> 02:39:14,380
classes and that's how it got got like 
more specific,

3774
02:39:14,381 --> 02:39:17,260
like you have to be a certain way and I 
understand that you want to wait,

3775
02:39:17,500 --> 02:39:19,870
you want people to be within a certain 
weight of each other,

3776
02:39:20,350 --> 02:39:24,970
but then the problem is like you can't,
there's no way to really monitor that,

3777
02:39:25,990 --> 02:39:27,970
you know,
like some people blow up but tween their

3778
02:39:27,971 --> 02:39:30,520
camps and other people don't,
you know.

3779
02:39:30,521 --> 02:39:32,410
And how do you.
Yeah,

3780
02:39:32,411 --> 02:39:33,600
like you said,
how do you really regularly,

3781
02:39:33,670 --> 02:39:35,080
like what if,
what if I said,

3782
02:39:35,081 --> 02:39:36,700
you know,
I walk around at 1:47

3783
02:39:36,701 --> 02:39:37,630
and holly's like,
well,

3784
02:39:37,660 --> 02:39:39,850
you know,
I walk around at one 62.

3785
02:39:40,120 --> 02:39:41,650
Then you're like,
well then you can't fight each other.

3786
02:39:41,740 --> 02:39:42,520
But it's like,
she's like,

3787
02:39:42,521 --> 02:39:47,521
well,
when I die it and I do this and it come 

3788
02:39:47,521 --> 02:39:47,610
down,
I can make the same weight as as Misha.

3789
02:39:47,640 --> 02:39:52,640
It's like,
how much does she cut though that she 

3790
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:52,640
cut way more than you?
Or does she lower her body?

3791
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:57,391
Was sure she lowers the body way.
I'm going to guess and say she probably 

3792
02:39:58,481 --> 02:40:02,260
cuts from about one to 50 what I could 
be wrong.

3793
02:40:02,530 --> 02:40:07,530
See,
then you're only dealing with a few 

3794
02:40:07,530 --> 02:40:07,530
different pounds,
right?

3795
02:40:07,530 --> 02:40:08,000
Like would you say you're like 1:46,
one seven.

3796
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:09,900
You're dealing with three pounds.
Yeah.

3797
02:40:10,090 --> 02:40:11,680
So that's not,
that's not bad,

3798
02:40:11,860 --> 02:40:13,980
but that's not cutting weight.
It's not

3799
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:16,590
dehydrating.
I think we need to measure the amount of

3800
02:40:16,591 --> 02:40:18,540
hydration that's in the body.

3801
02:40:18,570 --> 02:40:23,570
Then what you do is what they instilled 
in the wrestling programs in high 

3802
02:40:23,570 --> 02:40:26,841
schools essentially they way you.
But you also have to pee into a cup and 

3803
02:40:26,841 --> 02:40:31,281
you have to be a certain amount hydrated
and then they tell you you can't go 

3804
02:40:31,281 --> 02:40:34,020
below a certain weight because that 
would mean you're dehydrating yourself.

3805
02:40:34,600 --> 02:40:38,040
That's,
that's definitely a smart scale.

3806
02:40:38,041 --> 02:40:43,041
And then like also you have to test the 
hydration of your urine and so you'd be 

3807
02:40:43,041 --> 02:40:44,520
able,
I mean that would be really the only way

3808
02:40:44,521 --> 02:40:49,170
to ensure people are not dehydrating 
themselves to make a weight.

3809
02:40:49,380 --> 02:40:51,700
Otherwise you do have to be the same way
though.

3810
02:40:51,710 --> 02:40:52,970
I mean to be,
to be fair,

3811
02:40:53,030 --> 02:40:56,970
to have 135 pound title,
it'd be 135 pounds.

3812
02:40:56,971 --> 02:40:57,720
Like you know,

3813
02:40:58,910 --> 02:41:02,210
it should probably be a diet thing more 
than a dehydration thing.

3814
02:41:02,450 --> 02:41:04,340
I just think that also would,
it's just,

3815
02:41:04,430 --> 02:41:09,430
it's such a dangerous sport already.
And to add this extremely dangerous 

3816
02:41:09,430 --> 02:41:13,301
weight cutting aspect to it.
Like the guy in Brazil who died last 

3817
02:41:13,301 --> 02:41:13,301
year from weight cutting.
Yeah.

3818
02:41:13,301 --> 02:41:18,220
That can happen.
And it's happened in high school 

3819
02:41:18,220 --> 02:41:20,600
wrestling.
It's in college wrestling and it's 

3820
02:41:20,600 --> 02:41:20,600
happened in mma a few times now.

3821
02:41:20,600 --> 02:41:21,150
It's not a good thing.
No,

3822
02:41:21,151 --> 02:41:24,330
it's not.
And the ivy ban from my understanding is

3823
02:41:24,331 --> 02:41:26,190
it's kind of silly because they,
they say like,

3824
02:41:26,191 --> 02:41:26,850
well,
you know,

3825
02:41:26,851 --> 02:41:29,940
because it can mask like a.
was it epo

3826
02:41:30,050 --> 02:41:31,700
or something?
They can mask certain type.

3827
02:41:31,730 --> 02:41:36,730
You have to talk to Novitsky,
but it can mask certain types of 

3828
02:41:36,730 --> 02:41:36,730
performance.

3829
02:41:36,730 --> 02:41:40,200
So from my understanding,
what I understand is that cyclist use to

3830
02:41:40,201 --> 02:41:45,201
use it like right before they knew that 
the person was going to come and test 

3831
02:41:45,201 --> 02:41:47,901
them,
they would hyperhydrate their blood so 

3832
02:41:47,901 --> 02:41:49,971
that it would look like it was a normal,
like a normal consistency or whatever 

3833
02:41:50,130 --> 02:41:50,760
level.
Yeah.

3834
02:41:50,761 --> 02:41:53,160
Yeah.
He crit levels that they would be d hi.

3835
02:41:53,270 --> 02:41:53,660
You know,
high.

3836
02:41:53,670 --> 02:41:54,630
Oh hyperhydrate.
It's,

3837
02:41:54,631 --> 02:41:56,070
there wouldn't be as much when they 
would draw it,

3838
02:41:56,700 --> 02:42:01,700
but the thing is,
is in our sport where first of all were 

3839
02:42:01,700 --> 02:42:04,260
monitored for at least probably three 
hours before a fight.

3840
02:42:04,350 --> 02:42:09,350
We're taking the venue in it and a 
commissioner does not leave our side at 

3841
02:42:09,350 --> 02:42:09,480
all.
There's no way to like cheat.

3842
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:11,280
There's no,
you're not going to ivy up for,

3843
02:42:11,281 --> 02:42:12,570
you know,
real quick,

3844
02:42:12,571 --> 02:42:13,130
10 minutes.
I'm like,

3845
02:42:13,140 --> 02:42:14,610
no,
like they're in the bathroom with you.

3846
02:42:14,790 --> 02:42:18,690
You're completely monitored.
And I feel like maybe if they were going

3847
02:42:18,691 --> 02:42:23,691
to abandon,
maybe they could do under like a 

3848
02:42:23,691 --> 02:42:25,071
medical.
Like if you need an Ivy afterwards and 

3849
02:42:25,071 --> 02:42:25,230
you have to go to the hospital and get 
one administered or something like there

3850
02:42:25,231 --> 02:42:30,231
could be a way around it because the 
thing about cyclists and other sports 

3851
02:42:30,231 --> 02:42:30,720
that they banned it and then they just 
transferred it over to mma.

3852
02:42:30,721 --> 02:42:33,260
It doesn't add up because we do cut 
weight,

3853
02:42:33,900 --> 02:42:38,900
you know that I agree with that.
It makes sense or not taking that into 

3854
02:42:38,900 --> 02:42:38,900
account.

3855
02:42:38,900 --> 02:42:43,500
The only thing that I would say is that 
what they're doing by the ban is keeping

3856
02:42:44,140 --> 02:42:48,190
their checking plastics,
that plastic residue that comes from the

3857
02:42:48,191 --> 02:42:52,090
tubes into your body.
And that could be from blood doping.

3858
02:42:52,630 --> 02:42:57,630
So blood doping could be one way that 
you could have an advantage in illegal 

3859
02:42:57,630 --> 02:43:00,310
advantage over your opponent.
And they could eliminate blood doping by

3860
02:43:00,311 --> 02:43:03,030
eliminating ivs because this,
um,

3861
02:43:03,120 --> 02:43:08,120
the,
the small trace amount of plastics that 

3862
02:43:08,120 --> 02:43:08,710
show up in your blood from use of an ivy
in the bag and the,

3863
02:43:08,740 --> 02:43:10,330
the,
the tube and all that stuff.

3864
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:12,010
You could use

3865
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:15,820
that with blood and gain an endurance 
advantage over your opponent.

3866
02:43:17,420 --> 02:43:22,420
You're saying by by using the ivy and 
putting like injecting like an epo is 

3867
02:43:22,661 --> 02:43:26,470
that you're saying by blood,
by putting blood like blood doping,

3868
02:43:26,471 --> 02:43:27,280
you know,
blood doping,

3869
02:43:27,281 --> 02:43:31,360
you take blood out of your body your way
in and then once you weigh in,

3870
02:43:31,580 --> 02:43:36,580
when they reintroduce that blood back in
your body have much more blood because 

3871
02:43:36,580 --> 02:43:36,970
your body's replenish the blood that was
missing.

3872
02:43:37,270 --> 02:43:40,510
Now you all of a sudden have a massive 
endurance advantage.

3873
02:43:40,860 --> 02:43:45,860
That's what epo replicates.
What epo replicates is what they were 

3874
02:43:45,860 --> 02:43:48,520
getting by just blood doping.
That's what blood doping.

3875
02:43:48,540 --> 02:43:50,350
It's just pulling blood out of your 
body,

3876
02:43:50,351 --> 02:43:53,590
storing it in,
and then you put your own blood.

3877
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:54,910
Yes.
You never heard of this?

3878
02:43:55,270 --> 02:43:56,140
Well,
I've heard of evo,

3879
02:43:56,141 --> 02:43:57,270
but I thought it was like,
well,

3880
02:43:57,271 --> 02:43:58,420
that's what EPO is.

3881
02:43:58,420 --> 02:44:03,160
Epo is a drug that stimulates your body 
to like you were at a high altitude.

3882
02:44:03,161 --> 02:44:08,161
I knew about that,
but I didn't think about like taking 

3883
02:44:08,161 --> 02:44:08,161
your own blood out and putting it back 
in.

3884
02:44:08,161 --> 02:44:09,550
You just have too much blood.
Yes,

3885
02:44:09,580 --> 02:44:14,580
you would have too much blood,
but temporarily it gives you a big 

3886
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:17,491
endurance advantage.
Eventually your body brings your blood 

3887
02:44:17,491 --> 02:44:18,300
back to baseline,
but that's what he was doing with epo is

3888
02:44:18,301 --> 02:44:23,301
doing,
is accelerating the amount of red blood 

3889
02:44:23,301 --> 02:44:26,311
cells of your body produces.
What blood doping is doing is 

3890
02:44:26,311 --> 02:44:29,641
reintroducing blood that you pulled out.
Once your body's replenished that 

3891
02:44:29,641 --> 02:44:33,811
missing blood,
now you're throwing even more blood in 

3892
02:44:33,811 --> 02:44:36,691
there.
It's probably actually safer than the 

3893
02:44:36,691 --> 02:44:38,950
EPO.
Epo can cause strokes and a epo is,

3894
02:44:39,030 --> 02:44:40,540
is tricky stuff.
But yeah,

3895
02:44:40,750 --> 02:44:42,820
it's uh,
it's also a drug that,

3896
02:44:42,840 --> 02:44:47,840
you know,
a lot of fighters have gotten caught 

3897
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:47,840
for.

3898
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:47,840
Well I thought because I didn't think 
about that,

3899
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:49,960
but I thought epo.
Is that like you can tell when it's,

3900
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:52,900
I guess like the color of the blood or 
something or a little bit different when

3901
02:44:52,901 --> 02:44:55,150
it's.
Or when you have epo in your system.

3902
02:44:55,151 --> 02:44:56,950
Like they can tell if it's fake.
Well,

3903
02:44:56,951 --> 02:44:58,330
they didn't use to be able to test for 
it,

3904
02:44:58,650 --> 02:44:59,890
but now they can't.
Now they can.

3905
02:45:00,130 --> 02:45:05,130
But I think the two issues with the ivy,
the main one is the masking of other 

3906
02:45:07,631 --> 02:45:12,631
performance enhancing drugs,
but another one is the possibility of 

3907
02:45:12,631 --> 02:45:14,860
using these bags and these tubes to add 
additional blood to your body.

3908
02:45:15,350 --> 02:45:18,040
So,
but I've also been told that that can be

3909
02:45:18,041 --> 02:45:23,041
worked around with a glass syringe and 
with a glass container for the blood or 

3910
02:45:25,991 --> 02:45:28,930
or ivy fluid.
So I don't know if that's true either.

3911
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:30,940
So weird.
Well,

3912
02:45:30,941 --> 02:45:35,941
this is going to be a lot of moves and 
countermoves Novitsky was saying that 

3913
02:45:37,181 --> 02:45:40,180
they figured out a way to make 
testosterone out of animals.

3914
02:45:40,330 --> 02:45:42,010
They're taking testosterone from 
animals.

3915
02:45:42,011 --> 02:45:47,011
It's indistinguishable from the bio 
testosterone that your actual body 

3916
02:45:47,011 --> 02:45:48,610
produces versus like the stuff they make
now,

3917
02:45:48,970 --> 02:45:53,200
which they make in some sort of a 
laboratory environment with wild yams.

3918
02:45:53,470 --> 02:45:58,470
That's how they.
That's how they make testosterone with 

3919
02:45:58,470 --> 02:46:00,961
the yams.
That's one of the reasons why a carbon 

3920
02:46:00,961 --> 02:46:03,631
isotope test can differentiate between 
exogenous testosterone and testosterone.

3921
02:46:04,041 --> 02:46:06,730
This naturally produced by the body.
That's crazy.

3922
02:46:06,760 --> 02:46:09,340
It's fucking nuts.
Know what I mean?

3923
02:46:09,350 --> 02:46:11,660
You're,
you're dealing with this massive,

3924
02:46:11,690 --> 02:46:15,320
massive sport that's just so crazy that 
there's.

3925
02:46:15,560 --> 02:46:20,560
And we have to tell you it's there's the
edges that you gain,

3926
02:46:20,810 --> 02:46:25,810
I mean the edge that you got to think 
about all the strength and conditioning 

3927
02:46:25,810 --> 02:46:28,100
that you did,
all the crazy drills you did,

3928
02:46:28,280 --> 02:46:33,280
it all came down to that moment in the 
fifth round where you knew you had to 

3929
02:46:33,280 --> 02:46:37,301
take holly down and in that battle,
which was so touch and go like it was 

3930
02:46:37,731 --> 02:46:39,110
like she was countering.

3931
02:46:39,110 --> 02:46:41,180
You were dragging her down.
It was a struggle.

3932
02:46:41,780 --> 02:46:46,780
Any little edge,
any little edge there is the difference 

3933
02:46:46,780 --> 02:46:47,600
between you walking away the new champ 
and you losing a decision.

3934
02:46:48,010 --> 02:46:51,920
I mean any little edge there.
And that's where it comes down to people

3935
02:46:52,070 --> 02:46:55,280
and that's where people get fucking 
shady as fuck,

3936
02:46:58,220 --> 02:47:01,250
right?
Fuck.

3937
02:47:01,470 --> 02:47:03,740
That's got to be the hardest feeling in 
the world though,

3938
02:47:03,741 --> 02:47:08,741
to know that the reason why you did when
it wouldn't be satisfying camper,

3939
02:47:10,030 --> 02:47:13,220
he can't now or if it is then it's just 
like why?

3940
02:47:13,730 --> 02:47:15,200
Why,
why would you do?

3941
02:47:15,230 --> 02:47:17,060
Why would you do a sport like that?
Like I dunno.

3942
02:47:17,390 --> 02:47:22,390
I think sometimes people do it because 
they think other people are doing it 

3943
02:47:22,390 --> 02:47:22,390
too.
Like I remember Fitch,

3944
02:47:22,390 --> 02:47:23,600
I had a conversation with Fitch wants 
and he was like,

3945
02:47:23,601 --> 02:47:25,490
um,
I would never do anything.

3946
02:47:25,491 --> 02:47:28,250
This is back when testosterone was legal
and he was like,

3947
02:47:28,251 --> 02:47:30,230
I wouldn't do anything until I'm done.

3948
02:47:30,230 --> 02:47:31,780
He goes,
once I'm done fighting is.

3949
02:47:31,790 --> 02:47:36,790
Yeah,
I would definitely take hormone 

3950
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:36,790
replacement therapy when I'm older and 
all this chance.

3951
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:40,601
But right now he was,
I would want to know that I did 

3952
02:47:40,601 --> 02:47:43,361
everything I did by myself.
But then Fitch pissed hot now.

3953
02:47:43,610 --> 02:47:45,200
Then he got caught,
you know,

3954
02:47:45,680 --> 02:47:50,680
he was fighting Paul Horace and 
everybody knows Paul might very drawn a 

3955
02:47:50,680 --> 02:47:51,950
little something,
you know.

3956
02:47:51,951 --> 02:47:54,680
And so I think maybe it was one of those
things where he's like,

3957
02:47:54,681 --> 02:47:56,450
look,
this is not a level playing field.

3958
02:47:56,510 --> 02:48:01,510
I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna Cheat Myself while this 

3959
02:48:01,510 --> 02:48:02,250
guy is doing something.
And that's the problem was like,

3960
02:48:02,420 --> 02:48:03,710
you know,
everyone says cheating.

3961
02:48:03,711 --> 02:48:06,710
Then you either have to or there's gotta
be a way to combat it.

3962
02:48:06,770 --> 02:48:08,900
And that's the asterix on the pride 
days.

3963
02:48:08,990 --> 02:48:11,240
You know,
that's the one thing you have to look at

3964
02:48:11,241 --> 02:48:12,020
it.
You gotta go man,

3965
02:48:12,021 --> 02:48:12,980
amazing times.

3966
02:48:12,980 --> 02:48:15,740
But who knows what the fuck everybody 
was doing,

3967
02:48:16,190 --> 02:48:19,100
who knows what everybody was on 100 
percent.

3968
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:24,140
Yeah,
it's really interesting and it's really 

3969
02:48:24,140 --> 02:48:27,170
interesting that this sport is so,
it's,

3970
02:48:27,240 --> 02:48:32,240
it's so popular now and there's so much 
riding on it that it really sort of 

3971
02:48:32,240 --> 02:48:36,341
highlights all of this,
these moving and pushing of the 

3972
02:48:36,341 --> 02:48:37,160
boundaries and trying to achieve an 
edge,

3973
02:48:37,610 --> 02:48:42,610
you know,
how much can you achieve through 

3974
02:48:42,610 --> 02:48:42,610
supplementation,
like natural things,

3975
02:48:42,610 --> 02:48:44,930
quarter's eps mushrooms and be 12 and 
natural supplements.

3976
02:48:44,931 --> 02:48:46,910
And how much can you achieve through 
that?

3977
02:48:47,210 --> 02:48:50,270
And how close does it get to illegal 
means?

3978
02:48:50,550 --> 02:48:51,190
Yeah.
I don't know.

3979
02:48:51,330 --> 02:48:53,720
I think when money gets involved it 
always changes things.

3980
02:48:53,750 --> 02:48:58,750
State politics changed a lot of changes 
a lot,

3981
02:48:59,331 --> 02:49:04,331
so people are willing to do whatever 
they can to get that win and get that 

3982
02:49:04,331 --> 02:49:04,331
paycheck.
I guess some people,

3983
02:49:04,331 --> 02:49:09,280
not everyone,
but how do you have a plan for how long 

3984
02:49:09,280 --> 02:49:09,280
you want to do this?

3985
02:49:09,400 --> 02:49:10,570
You know,
I used to,

3986
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:14,470
I used to think I had a plan.
That plan went out the window.

3987
02:49:15,830 --> 02:49:17,170
I just,
I turned 29.

3988
02:49:17,171 --> 02:49:21,480
I just turned 29 last August.
And um,

3989
02:49:21,610 --> 02:49:23,680
I still feel pretty damn good,
like,

3990
02:49:23,681 --> 02:49:25,060
you know,
it's weird that I feel that,

3991
02:49:25,170 --> 02:49:30,170
you know,
technically I've been doing this for 10 

3992
02:49:30,170 --> 02:49:32,041
years,
but I still feel like I have so much to 

3993
02:49:32,041 --> 02:49:32,200
learn and so much to offer and I feel 
like I'm learning so quickly.

3994
02:49:32,201 --> 02:49:34,180
Like man,
you know,

3995
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:36,340
I talked about the law of diminishing 
return,

3996
02:49:36,341 --> 02:49:38,650
all that I don't feel like that applies 
to me for some reason.

3997
02:49:39,100 --> 02:49:42,580
Like I still feel like I'm just evolving
so quickly and so rapidly,

3998
02:49:42,581 --> 02:49:47,581
especially with my striking because it 
wasn't something I ever focused on 

3999
02:49:47,581 --> 02:49:48,400
before,
is that it sounds weird.

4000
02:49:48,401 --> 02:49:49,960
Like I didn't focus on it.
You start folks.

4001
02:49:49,980 --> 02:49:54,980
Got,
I started focusing on it more right 

4002
02:49:54,980 --> 02:49:57,520
before I fought Ronda focusing on it.

4003
02:49:58,180 --> 02:50:03,180
But I'm,
I moved my camp to Las Vegas like 

4004
02:50:03,180 --> 02:50:03,670
halfway through that training camp,
which was,

4005
02:50:04,270 --> 02:50:08,350
it needed to happen,
but it was bad timing in that I'm just,

4006
02:50:08,351 --> 02:50:12,040
I'm getting like a couple of new coaches
and we don't have the lingo down yet.

4007
02:50:12,041 --> 02:50:17,041
And it's like a language you learned 
between your coaches and we didn't have 

4008
02:50:17,041 --> 02:50:17,041
that.
So there was definitely some hiccups.

4009
02:50:17,290 --> 02:50:17,680
But,
um,

4010
02:50:17,740 --> 02:50:18,340
after that,
you know,

4011
02:50:18,341 --> 02:50:20,540
I won firefights and won a title,
you know,

4012
02:50:20,560 --> 02:50:22,180
so I think I definitely made the right 
move,

4013
02:50:22,181 --> 02:50:25,210
just maybe the timing was bad,
but I started focusing on it,

4014
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:27,730
you know,
six weeks before that camp.

4015
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:29,680
And then since then I've been working 
with my coach,

4016
02:50:29,681 --> 02:50:31,750
Jimmy Gifford,
um,

4017
02:50:31,810 --> 02:50:36,810
you know,
and he's helped me tremendously and 

4018
02:50:36,810 --> 02:50:39,301
focused more on my strength and 
conditioning actually making a regiment 

4019
02:50:39,301 --> 02:50:40,120
and doing,
doing all the things that I guess you're

4020
02:50:40,121 --> 02:50:43,750
supposed to do as a professional athlete
because before what I was doing just was

4021
02:50:43,751 --> 02:50:46,660
kind of,
I was a little bit ignorant and I worked

4022
02:50:46,661 --> 02:50:49,690
hard but worked harder,
not smarter kind of a thing.

4023
02:50:49,750 --> 02:50:52,510
Now I have people back,
we have a nutritionist,

4024
02:50:52,511 --> 02:50:54,730
I was sports Dr.
have a strength coach,

4025
02:50:54,731 --> 02:50:59,731
I have a striking coach,
have a to mma coaches and wrestling 

4026
02:50:59,731 --> 02:51:03,661
coach and they've got it all like.
And I feel like I finally figured it 

4027
02:51:03,661 --> 02:51:03,661
out.
Finally,

4028
02:51:03,661 --> 02:51:03,670
have a good gym where I'm at and 
everything too.

4029
02:51:03,671 --> 02:51:03,970
So.

4030
02:51:04,580 --> 02:51:05,990
Well,
that's where it all comes together,

4031
02:51:05,991 --> 02:51:10,991
right?
Is when your dedication matches your 

4032
02:51:10,991 --> 02:51:11,210
talent,
matches your focus and your desire.

4033
02:51:11,211 --> 02:51:14,330
And it all comes together.
And now as a champion,

4034
02:51:14,331 --> 02:51:16,320
do you feel like do,
do,

4035
02:51:16,370 --> 02:51:19,340
do you have more confidence now being a 
champion?

4036
02:51:19,341 --> 02:51:24,341
Do you feel different?
Like do you feel like a fucking did it 

4037
02:51:24,341 --> 02:51:24,341
100 percent,
but I belong here.

4038
02:51:24,440 --> 02:51:27,440
It's one thing to believe you can and 
it's another to know you can,

4039
02:51:28,300 --> 02:51:29,990
you know,
believing you can.

4040
02:51:30,260 --> 02:51:31,790
I mean that's important.
That's crucial.

4041
02:51:31,791 --> 02:51:36,791
You have to believe.
But it's entirely different once you 

4042
02:51:36,791 --> 02:51:36,791
know,
you're like,

4043
02:51:36,791 --> 02:51:39,230
and now I know not,
not only do I know,

4044
02:51:39,231 --> 02:51:41,960
but everyone else knows too,
you know,

4045
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:44,360
that's a different feeling.
It's a whole different animal.

4046
02:51:44,361 --> 02:51:45,830
It's a whole different ballgame.
Like I,

4047
02:51:45,930 --> 02:51:50,930
something's changed inside me that I 
can't explain some things just 

4048
02:51:50,930 --> 02:51:51,970
different.
And um,

4049
02:51:52,040 --> 02:51:53,240
felt like I hit a new level.

4050
02:51:53,380 --> 02:51:55,750
You feel very satisfied.
I am saying this,

4051
02:51:55,751 --> 02:51:56,280
I can tell

4052
02:51:56,400 --> 02:51:58,470
super confident,
super satisfied,

4053
02:51:58,471 --> 02:52:03,471
super confident.
I was still hungry or I still feel like 

4054
02:52:03,471 --> 02:52:03,471
I have a lot to accomplish,
you know,

4055
02:52:03,471 --> 02:52:04,350
I have,
I think I have a really tough match.

4056
02:52:04,351 --> 02:52:07,550
And Amanda definitely do.
She's mad at Nunez is no joke.

4057
02:52:07,570 --> 02:52:08,920
No,
she's dangerous job.

4058
02:52:08,980 --> 02:52:11,320
I remember.
Did you watch her fight with Julia Budd?

4059
02:52:11,410 --> 02:52:16,410
Strikeforce,
but she knocked her out with that one 

4060
02:52:16,410 --> 02:52:17,390
punch and Julie Bud was the bigger,
stronger girl and a striker.

4061
02:52:17,860 --> 02:52:18,550
She knocked out.
I mean,

4062
02:52:18,630 --> 02:52:21,810
she's got one punch knockout power.
She showed up against a good man.

4063
02:52:22,170 --> 02:52:22,720
You know,
she,

4064
02:52:22,721 --> 02:52:23,830
she,
she beat.

4065
02:52:24,610 --> 02:52:25,930
She'd be down.
Sarah Mcmahon.

4066
02:52:25,960 --> 02:52:27,760
She beat her down.
She hit her so hard.

4067
02:52:27,761 --> 02:52:32,761
That just made her on it quit.
And then she climbed on her back and 

4068
02:52:32,761 --> 02:52:32,761
choked her out.
Like,

4069
02:52:32,761 --> 02:52:32,980
man,
she's good.

4070
02:52:32,981 --> 02:52:35,770
She's well dangerous.
He's very dangerous.

4071
02:52:36,130 --> 02:52:41,130
You know?
I think that she might have an issue 

4072
02:52:41,130 --> 02:52:42,691
with cardio if I was going to pick out,
pick out something that might be 

4073
02:52:42,691 --> 02:52:42,880
something you maybe she's not as 
efficient in the cage,

4074
02:52:42,881 --> 02:52:43,910
but she's.

4075
02:52:43,940 --> 02:52:45,480
We are working to change that.
No,

4076
02:52:45,490 --> 02:52:47,260
she knows this is a five round fight.
I can't.

4077
02:52:47,440 --> 02:52:52,270
I can't rely on someone getting tired.
That's never a good game plan.

4078
02:52:52,300 --> 02:52:52,750
Like,
okay,

4079
02:52:52,751 --> 02:52:55,980
I'm just going to try to stay out of 
harm's way until she gets tired.

4080
02:52:55,990 --> 02:52:56,240
Like,
well,

4081
02:52:56,260 --> 02:52:59,410
she seems to explode and fights and then
drain the gas tank.

4082
02:52:59,580 --> 02:53:02,740
She's trying to stop people and if it 
doesn't work out that way,

4083
02:53:02,741 --> 02:53:07,741
she has a little bit of an issue ever 
wins or something or first round 

4084
02:53:07,741 --> 02:53:07,741
finishes.
She's a monster.

4085
02:53:07,741 --> 02:53:08,500
Yeah.
Very,

4086
02:53:08,501 --> 02:53:11,200
very strong striker.
Did very physically strong person.

4087
02:53:11,201 --> 02:53:16,201
She's kind of like a brown or black belt
in Jujitsu and a brown or a black belt 

4088
02:53:16,201 --> 02:53:16,201
in judo.
Yep.

4089
02:53:16,201 --> 02:53:16,340
Very well rounded.
Yeah.

4090
02:53:16,341 --> 02:53:18,820
There's not that many girls in our 
division that are that well rounded.

4091
02:53:19,570 --> 02:53:24,570
Um,
so she doesn't have a lot of holes in 

4092
02:53:24,570 --> 02:53:26,161
her game besides,
besides a seeming to hit a wall 

4093
02:53:26,161 --> 02:53:26,161
sometimes in a fight and yeah,

4094
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:30,620
with her as one of the things that I 
said about holly and the Rhonda fight,

4095
02:53:30,621 --> 02:53:35,621
it's like you look at how accomplished 
holly is outside of the UFC and you wait

4096
02:53:36,260 --> 02:53:41,260
until the moment which you could put it 
all together inside the octagon and she 

4097
02:53:41,260 --> 02:53:43,400
might put it all together inside the 
octagon when the moment is the biggest,

4098
02:53:43,580 --> 02:53:45,470
when she has to rise to the occasion.
That might,

4099
02:53:45,500 --> 02:53:50,300
when you push her back against the wall,
it might be when you see her at her best

4100
02:53:50,301 --> 02:53:53,210
and it turned out to be exactly that and
someone like Amanda,

4101
02:53:53,211 --> 02:53:55,340
she's going to realize like this is the 
time,

4102
02:53:55,670 --> 02:53:57,740
this is the opportunity to put it all 
together.

4103
02:53:57,930 --> 02:54:02,060
Can't half ass a thing in training thing
with nutrition thing with your mind.

4104
02:54:02,150 --> 02:54:05,840
She has to show up 100 percent focused 
and so for someone like you,

4105
02:54:06,050 --> 02:54:08,090
you have to look at her like her 
potential

4106
02:54:08,110 --> 02:54:12,340
and look at all of all the girl would 
beat Sara Mcmann.

4107
02:54:12,341 --> 02:54:13,690
That's the one that I'm training,
you know,

4108
02:54:13,760 --> 02:54:16,060
and even better than that girl because 
we have to assume she's evolved.

4109
02:54:16,490 --> 02:54:21,490
That's the best.
I think I've seen her look so I have to 

4110
02:54:21,490 --> 02:54:21,490
assume like she's going to be better 
than that even.

4111
02:54:21,580 --> 02:54:23,160
Do you have goals

4112
02:54:23,430 --> 02:54:26,340
as far as like what you want to do with 
the title?

4113
02:54:26,670 --> 02:54:30,540
How long do you want to hold it?
Do you have any thoughts in mind of like

4114
02:54:31,260 --> 02:54:34,540
must be opponents like is getting Rhonda
back in the auction?

4115
02:54:34,820 --> 02:54:36,190
Yeah,
that's important.

4116
02:54:36,460 --> 02:54:38,530
I need that.
Like that has to happen.

4117
02:54:38,590 --> 02:54:42,130
That's very important to me and I have 
Amanda had of me,

4118
02:54:42,131 --> 02:54:45,100
I do not want to look pastor because you
think that would be a huge mistake.

4119
02:54:45,101 --> 02:54:47,380
It's not one that I want to make as a 
veteran in my career.

4120
02:54:47,381 --> 02:54:49,370
That would be a rookie move.
Um,

4121
02:54:49,420 --> 02:54:50,620
but you know,
in the back of my mind,

4122
02:54:50,621 --> 02:54:53,440
of course,
like the fight with Ronda is something I

4123
02:54:53,441 --> 02:54:56,380
want to happen and you don't know when 
it will happen.

4124
02:54:56,381 --> 02:55:01,381
It could be anticipated for November.
I've heard that be tossed around in the 

4125
02:55:01,381 --> 02:55:04,381
UFC that she's planning on coming back 
and maybe it might be Madison Square 

4126
02:55:04,381 --> 02:55:04,381
Garden.
That would be great.

4127
02:55:04,381 --> 02:55:06,440
I want to focus on that.
I want to focus on Amanda,

4128
02:55:06,710 --> 02:55:08,510
but I know in the back of my mind and I 
want,

4129
02:55:08,870 --> 02:55:11,120
I want that fight.
Like I want that to happen.

4130
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:16,120
I think it's so important to me and my 
career to go and beat Ronda and prove 

4131
02:55:16,120 --> 02:55:18,230
everyone else.
Like I've been an underdog in most of my

4132
02:55:18,231 --> 02:55:23,231
fights.
I had been the person that people have 

4133
02:55:23,231 --> 02:55:23,360
always counted out in my entire career,
my entire life.

4134
02:55:23,690 --> 02:55:25,940
Most people are telling me,
you can't,

4135
02:55:26,120 --> 02:55:27,140
you couldn't,
you shouldn't,

4136
02:55:27,141 --> 02:55:29,060
you wouldn't,
and I'm,

4137
02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:29,750
you know,
that's,

4138
02:55:29,751 --> 02:55:31,700
I'm fine with that.
I'm perfectly fine with that.

4139
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:35,060
I am at the best point in my career and 
Rhonda is at the worst.

4140
02:55:35,450 --> 02:55:40,450
You know,
she's going through what I've already 

4141
02:55:40,450 --> 02:55:42,431
been through time and time again and I 
have built myself back up from that 

4142
02:55:42,431 --> 02:55:43,670
point.
Time and time again.

4143
02:55:43,880 --> 02:55:46,190
I know that I can do that.
I'm confident in that.

4144
02:55:46,191 --> 02:55:51,191
Here I am standing the strongest that 
I've ever stood and I've already been 

4145
02:55:51,191 --> 02:55:54,461
through that.
I've already been head kicked and 

4146
02:55:54,461 --> 02:55:54,461
knocked out.

4147
02:55:54,461 --> 02:55:54,590
That happened to me before,
like I picked myself up,

4148
02:55:54,770 --> 02:55:59,770
but pull myself up by my bootstraps,
but one foot back in front of the other 

4149
02:55:59,770 --> 02:56:00,140
and worked.
Got My strike first world title.

4150
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:05,200
I lost the Toronto pick myself back up,
but one phone interview the other got 

4151
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:05,510
back on the horse,
fought,

4152
02:56:05,511 --> 02:56:06,110
fought,
fought,

4153
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:08,780
fought.
Ronda Rousey was devastated,

4154
02:56:08,781 --> 02:56:13,781
crushed,
thought my world was just falling down 

4155
02:56:13,781 --> 02:56:13,781
around me.
Coming to an end,

4156
02:56:14,110 --> 02:56:19,110
pack up.
We're going to put one foot in from the 

4157
02:56:19,110 --> 02:56:19,110
other guy back on the horse,
and now here I am,

4158
02:56:19,110 --> 02:56:19,790
the world champion.
You know,

4159
02:56:19,850 --> 02:56:23,870
I know that I'm tough.
I know that I have what it takes to beat

4160
02:56:23,871 --> 02:56:26,180
Ronda.
Many people don't believe that.

4161
02:56:26,330 --> 02:56:28,640
That's okay.
I've been in this position before.

4162
02:56:28,700 --> 02:56:30,590
Many most people didn't think I was 
going to beat holly.

4163
02:56:31,190 --> 02:56:32,380
Most people don't think holly was gonna.
Beat.

4164
02:56:32,440 --> 02:56:34,640
Ronda doesn't matter to me what other 
people think.

4165
02:56:34,670 --> 02:56:39,670
It matters what I believe and what I 
know and I'm the question mark is how is

4166
02:56:40,721 --> 02:56:45,721
Rhonda going to come back from this?
I know what I've been hearing from 

4167
02:56:45,721 --> 02:56:48,440
Rhonda in the media and the press.
She's been a little quiet lately,

4168
02:56:48,441 --> 02:56:53,441
but before that it wasn't what I would 
have expected to hear from someone who 

4169
02:56:53,441 --> 02:56:55,190
really wants to come back and he was 
really,

4170
02:56:55,191 --> 02:56:58,820
really a fighter at the core.
She's a great athlete.

4171
02:56:58,850 --> 02:57:01,040
She's a great fighter.
She's accomplished a lot of things.

4172
02:57:01,280 --> 02:57:02,890
Credit where credit's due,
you know,

4173
02:57:02,900 --> 02:57:07,900
I give her a round of applause for 
everything she's been able to 

4174
02:57:07,900 --> 02:57:07,900
accomplish.
I'll tell you what,

4175
02:57:07,900 --> 02:57:12,880
every time I've ever lost in my career,
I went bananas to get back in their 

4176
02:57:13,490 --> 02:57:14,360
ballistic.
I was like,

4177
02:57:14,361 --> 02:57:16,970
I have to like right now,
just like holly was like,

4178
02:57:17,130 --> 02:57:18,230
they're like,
when do you want to fight again?

4179
02:57:18,290 --> 02:57:20,720
Just like tomorrow.
I meesha.

4180
02:57:20,840 --> 02:57:22,520
Now.
That's what you want to hear.

4181
02:57:22,521 --> 02:57:25,850
When someone has a devastating loss,
they want to get back in there right now

4182
02:57:25,851 --> 02:57:28,130
and face that person right now or or 
someone else,

4183
02:57:28,131 --> 02:57:30,200
just get that loss of the record.
Erase it.

4184
02:57:30,500 --> 02:57:34,100
When I lost the cat Zingano,
I freaked out.

4185
02:57:34,190 --> 02:57:36,190
I freaked out.
I called Sean Shelby and I was like,

4186
02:57:36,320 --> 02:57:39,470
get me another fight right now.
He was like,

4187
02:57:39,471 --> 02:57:41,480
your noses even heal.
I don't give a fuck.

4188
02:57:41,570 --> 02:57:43,010
I want to.
I want to fight.

4189
02:57:43,160 --> 02:57:48,160
I want it now.
I want to know when it's coming up like 

4190
02:57:48,160 --> 02:57:48,800
right now or I'm going to freak out.
I don't know what to tell you,

4191
02:57:48,801 --> 02:57:51,610
but I'm going to lose my shit if I don't
have like a fight on the horizon,

4192
02:57:51,620 --> 02:57:53,870
lose it.
And then I hear Rhonda,

4193
02:57:53,871 --> 02:57:56,780
like I'm going to take a year off and 
I'm gonna.

4194
02:57:57,170 --> 02:57:58,220
You know,
I'm going to do this.

4195
02:57:58,480 --> 02:58:01,040
I'm like,
that just doesn't sound like someone who

4196
02:58:01,050 --> 02:58:06,050
really wants this anymore.
And I think that fight might've broke 

4197
02:58:06,050 --> 02:58:06,050
her.
I could be wrong,

4198
02:58:06,150 --> 02:58:08,970
but I think something inside of her is 
different than it was before.

4199
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:11,340
Um,
maybe she's not broken,

4200
02:58:11,341 --> 02:58:12,000
but it's different

4201
02:58:12,290 --> 02:58:17,290
because how much do you think of factor 
is how much of a factor do you think 

4202
02:58:17,401 --> 02:58:20,850
success is in the park in terms of she's
doing movies.

4203
02:58:21,150 --> 02:58:26,150
She's,
she was a darling always late night 

4204
02:58:26,150 --> 02:58:28,230
television shows and everybody wanted to
hang out with us doing these commercials

4205
02:58:28,231 --> 02:58:29,720
with,
you know,

4206
02:58:29,760 --> 02:58:33,120
seth rogen on television,
like how much of a factor is on?

4207
02:58:33,820 --> 02:58:35,170
Well,
she asked security,

4208
02:58:35,171 --> 02:58:37,210
now she has job security outside the 
UFC.

4209
02:58:37,211 --> 02:58:42,211
Sushi doesn't really need that anymore.
And I think maybe that's also something 

4210
02:58:42,211 --> 02:58:42,850
on her mind is like,
does she really want this?

4211
02:58:42,851 --> 02:58:45,160
Because winning is awesome.
It's great.

4212
02:58:45,280 --> 02:58:46,960
It's easy.
It's like when you win,

4213
02:58:46,961 --> 02:58:48,850
everybody loves you.
Everybody supports you.

4214
02:58:48,851 --> 02:58:50,770
Everybody's there.
Everybody's on your train.

4215
02:58:51,310 --> 02:58:55,780
When you lose fucking sucks.
It sucks.

4216
02:58:55,840 --> 02:58:58,540
And only the people that really love 
your still really,

4217
02:58:58,541 --> 02:59:00,700
really there for you.
Everyone else was just like,

4218
02:59:00,730 --> 02:59:01,780
Eh,
whatever the loser,

4219
02:59:01,870 --> 02:59:03,700
and then you have the social media,
you know,

4220
02:59:03,701 --> 02:59:08,701
White Knights that come out and want to 
tell you what a piece of shit you are 

4221
02:59:08,701 --> 02:59:12,091
and how you're never gonna accomplish 
anything and you'll never win another 

4222
02:59:12,091 --> 02:59:12,091
fight and you might as well just quit 
and retire,

4223
02:59:12,091 --> 02:59:12,091
blah,
blah blah.

4224
02:59:12,091 --> 02:59:16,190
So those people and you have to make a 
choice,

4225
02:59:16,191 --> 02:59:20,350
you know,
and my choice is always been the to do,

4226
02:59:20,410 --> 02:59:20,790
to,
to,

4227
02:59:20,791 --> 02:59:22,250
to keep fighting,
you know,

4228
02:59:22,300 --> 02:59:23,530
to add.
It just don't.

4229
02:59:23,610 --> 02:59:28,610
I don't recognize.
There's a lot of things I recognize in 

4230
02:59:28,610 --> 02:59:28,930
Ronda that I can,
I can recognize her greatness,

4231
02:59:28,931 --> 02:59:33,931
I can recognize her championship,
I can recognize things I don't identify 

4232
02:59:33,931 --> 02:59:37,090
with that I don't identify with.
Sitting on that last for a year,

4233
02:59:37,120 --> 02:59:39,100
I cannot understand it.
If it was me,

4234
02:59:39,130 --> 02:59:42,350
it would have eaten me alive inside and 
out to.

4235
02:59:42,520 --> 02:59:44,680
I couldn't have done it.
I couldn't be making a movie.

4236
02:59:44,681 --> 02:59:45,460
I couldn't be doing that.
I would,

4237
02:59:45,470 --> 02:59:46,330
it would just.

4238
02:59:47,460 --> 02:59:49,060
But does she?
I don't think she has a choice.

4239
02:59:49,270 --> 02:59:52,030
I think if you have movie contracts,
I think you have to fulfill them.

4240
02:59:52,840 --> 02:59:55,630
How do you,
I dunno,

4241
02:59:55,640 --> 03:00:00,640
does Conrad have to show up for.
But showing up for press conferences is 

4242
03:00:00,640 --> 03:00:01,010
one thing,
but I don't think,

4243
03:00:01,160 --> 03:00:03,020
I think she could have.
She could have fought because they,

4244
03:00:03,050 --> 03:00:07,430
they said they had anticipated for her 
to come back at UFC 200.

4245
03:00:07,790 --> 03:00:12,050
They wanted that and they and,
and Dana said she could've but should,

4246
03:00:12,051 --> 03:00:14,660
she?
She could have but should she.

4247
03:00:14,770 --> 03:00:19,770
Well I think that could have and should,
she was because she had to do a movie 

4248
03:00:19,770 --> 03:00:20,230
for three months,
so like doing the movie for three months

4249
03:00:20,231 --> 03:00:22,000
would have taken three months outside of
her camp.

4250
03:00:22,001 --> 03:00:27,001
And you've done a movie before.
You know what it's like you're on the 

4251
03:00:27,001 --> 03:00:27,001
set all day.
It's 16 hour days.

4252
03:00:27,001 --> 03:00:28,750
It's long and grueling.
You don't have time to train,

4253
03:00:30,220 --> 03:00:35,220
but after a loss like that,
I think you really have to have enough 

4254
03:00:35,220 --> 03:00:37,450
time to actually focus and then on top 
of that to getting,

4255
03:00:37,540 --> 03:00:42,540
getting flatlined like that.
Like you have to have some time to 

4256
03:00:42,540 --> 03:00:43,060
recover.
Recover your head.

4257
03:00:43,110 --> 03:00:44,100
Yeah,
absolutely.

4258
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:47,790
I just don't know if a year that would.
I'm just saying that would crush me.

4259
03:00:47,791 --> 03:00:49,830
I wouldn't be able to do what she's 
doing right now.

4260
03:00:50,370 --> 03:00:53,460
I wouldn't physically be able to like to
deal with that for years.

4261
03:00:54,350 --> 03:00:56,220
And if I had to,
I think it would eat me alive.

4262
03:00:56,280 --> 03:01:00,040
Like I think I'd be so depressed and so 
I'm sure it's eating her alive

4263
03:01:00,130 --> 03:01:05,130
too.
But how do you sit on it for a year 

4264
03:01:05,130 --> 03:01:05,130
then?
How do you do that?

4265
03:01:05,130 --> 03:01:06,050
Do what you gotta do.
Can't.

4266
03:01:06,160 --> 03:01:07,030
I couldn't.
Well,

4267
03:01:07,031 --> 03:01:08,320
you know,
it's all speculation.

4268
03:01:08,350 --> 03:01:10,480
We only,
we don't know until she comes back.

4269
03:01:10,910 --> 03:01:12,260
But the other thing too is like,
no,

4270
03:01:12,290 --> 03:01:13,190
she's like,
you know,

4271
03:01:14,330 --> 03:01:16,580
she had her,
you're going to her downs or her really,

4272
03:01:16,581 --> 03:01:18,440
really low,
which I empathize with.

4273
03:01:18,800 --> 03:01:20,250
I've been there,
um,

4274
03:01:20,310 --> 03:01:21,290
you know,
but then she said,

4275
03:01:21,590 --> 03:01:23,180
you know,
I was thinking about,

4276
03:01:23,270 --> 03:01:24,860
you know,
these all these negative thoughts.

4277
03:01:24,861 --> 03:01:26,170
And,
and um,

4278
03:01:26,210 --> 03:01:28,430
then I looked up on the hill and she 
said this on the Ellen show.

4279
03:01:28,431 --> 03:01:30,760
I looked up and I saw Travis Brown and I
realized,

4280
03:01:30,761 --> 03:01:35,761
you know,
I've got to stick around to have his 

4281
03:01:35,761 --> 03:01:36,971
babies and I thought like what?
What went through my mind is like I 

4282
03:01:36,971 --> 03:01:41,711
gotta get back and get my title back.
I gotta get back and win a fight like 

4283
03:01:41,711 --> 03:01:45,101
it.
It just seemed like her mindset was 

4284
03:01:45,101 --> 03:01:45,110
different than what I would expect a 
fighter's mindset to be.

4285
03:01:46,250 --> 03:01:48,080
Does that make sense at all?
But I'm trying.

4286
03:01:48,110 --> 03:01:53,110
What I'm saying is like,
it didn't seem like her motivation was 

4287
03:01:53,110 --> 03:01:54,800
to fight and win again.

4288
03:01:54,800 --> 03:01:56,360
It was.
There was other things.

4289
03:01:56,570 --> 03:02:01,570
Now I'm not saying she's not going to 
come back and be great or come back and 

4290
03:02:01,570 --> 03:02:05,140
fight.
Not Questioning that and questioning 

4291
03:02:05,140 --> 03:02:07,211
where her true motivation is coming from
because I think while she was winning,

4292
03:02:07,940 --> 03:02:09,560
it was so awesome.
Like she's like,

4293
03:02:09,590 --> 03:02:09,950
well,
yeah,

4294
03:02:09,951 --> 03:02:12,110
I want to keep doing this course.
I want to keep it,

4295
03:02:12,111 --> 03:02:13,940
keep them crushing girls.
I'm demolishing them.

4296
03:02:14,270 --> 03:02:16,280
I'm a star.
All these great things are coming now.

4297
03:02:16,281 --> 03:02:18,070
She already has that.
She's already making movies.

4298
03:02:18,071 --> 03:02:20,210
She already has millions of millions of 
dollars.

4299
03:02:20,810 --> 03:02:23,270
Is Her true motivation?
Was it just,

4300
03:02:23,300 --> 03:02:28,300
you know,
keeping that undefeated streak because 

4301
03:02:28,300 --> 03:02:28,300
she talked about that so much,
you know,

4302
03:02:28,300 --> 03:02:31,070
I will retire undefeated w and then she,
she even said like,

4303
03:02:31,280 --> 03:02:33,950
I don't know,
I'm questioning what am I doing now?

4304
03:02:33,951 --> 03:02:34,640
Like,
you know,

4305
03:02:34,700 --> 03:02:36,500
now I'm not going to ever retire 
undefeated.

4306
03:02:36,501 --> 03:02:37,930
So what is my,
you know,

4307
03:02:37,980 --> 03:02:39,270
maybe I'm meant for this.
Maybe I met,

4308
03:02:39,350 --> 03:02:44,350
she doesn't really know that was her 
identity was like to be undefeated in 

4309
03:02:44,350 --> 03:02:44,350
this sport.
So if,

4310
03:02:44,350 --> 03:02:48,060
if that's not the goal anymore,
I just don't know.

4311
03:02:48,061 --> 03:02:53,061
Like I feel like I sent something off,
I send something is not right in her 

4312
03:02:53,061 --> 03:02:57,341
mindset and I think she's going to come 
back and I think she's going to fight 

4313
03:02:57,341 --> 03:02:57,341
anything.
She'll fight hard,

4314
03:02:57,341 --> 03:03:01,840
but I just don't know if she still has 
it after a brutal loss like that,

4315
03:03:04,340 --> 03:03:06,050
you know,
if she's still hungry enough.

4316
03:03:06,350 --> 03:03:07,890
Those are fighting words.
Restate.

4317
03:03:08,810 --> 03:03:09,770
Is she $100?

4318
03:03:09,800 --> 03:03:14,800
That's the question.
What you're doing right now is you're 

4319
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:14,880
throwing up the bat signal,
right?

4320
03:03:15,030 --> 03:03:17,810
Yeah.
Well that's how I feel I'm going to down

4321
03:03:17,880 --> 03:03:22,880
now.
I get a lot of shit because people are 

4322
03:03:22,880 --> 03:03:22,880
like,
oh,

4323
03:03:22,880 --> 03:03:22,880
you know,
he,

4324
03:03:22,880 --> 03:03:22,880
that's not what I,
I don't,

4325
03:03:22,880 --> 03:03:25,910
I don't apologize for anything that I 
say unless I really say it's something 

4326
03:03:25,910 --> 03:03:29,181
that was,
that I didn't mean to say that was 

4327
03:03:29,181 --> 03:03:29,181
hurtful to someone and I'm like,
oh,

4328
03:03:29,181 --> 03:03:29,181
I fucked up.
But honestly,

4329
03:03:29,181 --> 03:03:30,390
if it's my opinion is my opinion,
if you don't like it,

4330
03:03:30,890 --> 03:03:32,910
I'm not.
I'm not gonna apologize for my opinion.

4331
03:03:33,090 --> 03:03:38,090
Don't apologize for anything that I have
to say about the way I feel about 

4332
03:03:38,090 --> 03:03:38,450
Rhonda,
the way I feel about any,

4333
03:03:38,451 --> 03:03:39,820
any of these situations,
you know,

4334
03:03:39,821 --> 03:03:42,060
so I've just,
I'm going to be as transparent.

4335
03:03:43,180 --> 03:03:48,180
I don't think you're saying anything 
disrespectful either and I don't think 

4336
03:03:48,180 --> 03:03:50,810
you,
I think as a champion and that's what 

4337
03:03:50,810 --> 03:03:50,810
you are,
you,

4338
03:03:50,810 --> 03:03:53,890
you're analyzing someone's mindset and 
you're totally entitled to that.

4339
03:03:54,080 --> 03:03:59,080
Yeah.
And I have a lot of respect for Rhonda 

4340
03:03:59,080 --> 03:03:59,080
was an athlete.
You know,

4341
03:03:59,080 --> 03:04:00,950
a lot of guys think you'll ever be 
friends after all said and done.

4342
03:04:01,510 --> 03:04:03,140
Never.
I don't think so.

4343
03:04:03,280 --> 03:04:08,280
No.
I think she thinks that I've done so 

4344
03:04:08,280 --> 03:04:08,510
many things and like she,
I don't think she would ever.

4345
03:04:08,750 --> 03:04:11,330
I think she blames me for things that I 
didn't even do.

4346
03:04:11,660 --> 03:04:13,370
So that mean how do you even get around 
that?

4347
03:04:13,490 --> 03:04:14,180
Right.
You know,

4348
03:04:14,181 --> 03:04:16,340
like I heard when you guys did your 
interview,

4349
03:04:17,300 --> 03:04:22,300
she said something like that I called a 
promotion and like tried to get crispy 

4350
03:04:22,300 --> 03:04:25,880
or like mess with him before his fight 
or something like that.

4351
03:04:25,890 --> 03:04:30,890
That I guess he,
I guess he was contracted to another 

4352
03:04:30,890 --> 03:04:32,210
promotion and he wasn't supposed to be 
while he was on the ultimate fighter.

4353
03:04:32,300 --> 03:04:37,300
And I guess that that Dana,
I received a call and then they thought 

4354
03:04:37,300 --> 03:04:38,240
that I,
she thought that I did that.

4355
03:04:39,140 --> 03:04:40,120
I'm like,
first of,

4356
03:04:40,700 --> 03:04:45,700
first of all,
like I didn't even know he signed to 

4357
03:04:45,700 --> 03:04:46,040
another organization at all and if you 
know that can be was,

4358
03:04:46,190 --> 03:04:47,930
it didn't even,
wouldn't have even crossed my mind.

4359
03:04:47,931 --> 03:04:48,830
Like I'm too,
like you said,

4360
03:04:48,831 --> 03:04:51,200
I'm too easy going to even think of 
something like that.

4361
03:04:51,560 --> 03:04:55,020
And I'm not malicious by any means.
I have nothing against Krispy.

4362
03:04:55,021 --> 03:05:00,021
Oh.
But I think she thought that I tried to 

4363
03:05:00,021 --> 03:05:02,681
like mess with him,
like I called the promoter of whatever 

4364
03:05:02,681 --> 03:05:03,800
organization,
little small contract,

4365
03:05:03,890 --> 03:05:05,570
don't even know how I would have known 
that.

4366
03:05:06,500 --> 03:05:08,630
How would you even know that?
How do you know?

4367
03:05:08,930 --> 03:05:10,940
But this is the same girl that ripped 
page for,

4368
03:05:11,300 --> 03:05:16,300
for congratulating holly.
Like she has her way of thinking and 

4369
03:05:16,300 --> 03:05:17,990
she's going to hate me until the day she
dies and I'm okay with that.

4370
03:05:19,010 --> 03:05:21,410
That's fine.
We don't need to be friends.

4371
03:05:21,470 --> 03:05:23,420
That's okay.
You know,

4372
03:05:23,680 --> 03:05:26,020
I'm perfectly fine with that.
All right.

4373
03:05:26,330 --> 03:05:28,160
Yeah.
Well listen,

4374
03:05:28,600 --> 03:05:33,600
congratulations and everything.
What you did not Holly Holm fight was 

4375
03:05:33,600 --> 03:05:33,970
fucking amazing.
It's awesome.

4376
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:39,000
Thank you.
And I think you're a great 

4377
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:39,000
representative for women's martial arts,
for martial arts,

4378
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:39,550
period.
But as a champion,

4379
03:05:39,580 --> 03:05:43,120
I think you were a great representative.
Just your personality,

4380
03:05:43,300 --> 03:05:48,300
the way you carry yourself is very 
admirable and I think you're a great 

4381
03:05:48,300 --> 03:05:51,691
role model for people that are coming up
and looking at what a champion behaves 

4382
03:05:51,691 --> 03:05:51,820
like.
I appreciate it,

4383
03:05:51,821 --> 03:05:54,730
Joe Words.
Thanks for being on the podcast too.

4384
03:05:54,760 --> 03:05:57,730
Thanks for hanging out and for finally 
having fun anytime.

4385
03:05:58,710 --> 03:06:00,270
Bother you enough to get me on here.

4386
03:06:00,320 --> 03:06:02,480
People bother me cause it's not that I 
can do.

4387
03:06:02,481 --> 03:06:05,030
I only have so much time.
Thank you very much.

4388
03:06:06,080 --> 03:06:09,440
All right folks.
We'll be back Friday with Ian Edwards.

4389
03:06:09,470 --> 03:06:09,950
See you then.
