00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,390
that's my laptop in the backdrop.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,550
Whoopsies we're also sponsored
by onnit.com o n n I t,

10
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:28,140
makers of Alpha brain,

11
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:31,260
a cognitive enhancer and a new mood,

12
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:33,120
which is a five HTP supplement.

13
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:36,330
It has five HTP and it
also has l tryptofan.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,180
So it has like sort of
a time release time.

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,500
It's like a,

16
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:41,430
it gives you the,

17
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:45,330
the effects a longer throughout the
day because El Tryptofan is one of the

18
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:48,420
building blocks of five HTP and Serotonin.

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,750
So it's a,

20
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:52,080
a great mood enhancing supplement.

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,830
I enjoy it.

22
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,610
And um,

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,810
as we say with all these things,

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,651
if you,

25
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:56,370
uh,

26
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,260
if you're inching into nootropics,

27
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:59,220
please go online,

28
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:00,054
research it,

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,690
look into it.

30
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,710
There's some interesting stuff.

31
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:02,550
Experiment with it.

32
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,510
If you think that you know our stuff
costs too much or you don't have the money

33
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:06,961
or whatever,

34
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:07,290
just it,

35
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,400
just steal the recipe,

36
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,181
steal the recipe,

37
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:12,990
go buy your own stuff in bulk and
try it out and I hope it works.

38
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,550
And if you want to buy it from us,

39
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,520

40
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:19,570

41
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,430
you'll get 10% off that two son.

42
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,461
All right,

43
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:25,680
we've got a a serious man here today,

44
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:27,540
Ladies and gentlemen
for some serious talk.

45
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:28,770
But uh,

46
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,750
he may or may not have
smoked the devil's cabbage.

47
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:32,430
So we're going to have a good time.

48
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,331
Kick it,

49
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:34,164
Brian.

50
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,770
Where's the music?

51
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,680
Oh,

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,513
what'd you do?

53
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,043
What is this?

54
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,890
This is like a remote version of the song.

55
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:47,730
What's,

56
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,170
it doesn't go through the speaker.

57
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,920
I forgot that we got to
get a new computer folks.

58
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,530
We've got to get a new computer.

59
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,070
Are A,

60
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,930
we have only a few years old,

61
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,030
but try running a computer from four
years ago with today's operating systems

62
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:03,440
and all this stuff.

63
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:03,590
It's,

64
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,840
it's,

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,860
you noticed the difference.

66
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:06,660
You notice a big difference
in how fast it works,

67
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,230
especially when you're not
just like using iphoto.

68
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,153
Yeah.

69
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,051
Yeah.

70
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:15,280
I feel like for regular stuff it's almost
like they make things more complicated

71
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:16,540
so you actually need,

72
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,111
you know,

73
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:18,970
a bigger hard drive and a bigger,

74
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,481
you know,

75
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:21,160
a a faster processor.

76
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,820
But you know for like just web browsing
how much that's what most people do.

77
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:25,870
It's the most intensive thing.

78
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:26,811
Yeah.

79
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:31,280
I don't think many people are editing
podcasts and videos and this and this one.

80
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:31,820
This is the old,

81
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,451
what's the power?

82
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:33,284
Mac is what is,

83
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,070
what's it called?

84
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,020
That shit is like the noisiest
thing in the whole entire world.

85
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,930
It's like that's supposed to
be that top of the line thing,

86
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:42,410
but there's 17 fans on there and the
thing just sounds like it's going to take

87
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,370
on men for being in the room
with sensitive mics and podcasts.

88
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,330
It's meant for,

89
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,720
you know,

90
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,800
some serious work.

91
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,723
Yeah.

92
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,380
Our friend we have here today,

93
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:52,250
ladies and gentlemen,

94
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,900
is a serious author,

95
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:54,381
a man,

96
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:56,630
his name is Daniel Bolelli as I say it,

97
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:56,900
right?

98
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,470
Yup.

99
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,100
And he wrote a book about arts called a

100
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,870
on the warrior's path and also wrote
a book about religion called 50,

101
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,171
what is it,

102
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:07,300
the 50 things they don't want
to or not supposed to know.

103
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,080
Religion.

104
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,441
Yeah.

105
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:10,510
And you wrote it for disinformation.

106
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,910
So this Info Dotcom guys,

107
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:13,960
which I really,

108
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,040
I'm a fan of their stuff.

109
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,971
I love the,

110
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:16,091
uh,

111
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:17,650
the Europe being lied to books.

112
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,513
They're great,

113
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,241
really,

114
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,500
really awesome stuff.

115
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,990
And really like great toilet reading,

116
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,273
you know,

117
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,880
a feast.

118
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,200
The person who tells me that say,

119
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:26,381
yeah,

120
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:26,621
you know,

121
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:27,730
because you are being lied to.

122
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,100
It's like really short
paragraphs and you know,

123
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:30,491
you might,

124
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:33,490
if you're healthy you probably won't get
through a whole paragraph and a shit.

125
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,290
If you get through a whole
paragraph and his shit,

126
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,780
you might want to put some
Broccoli in your diet,

127
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,770
you know,

128
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,281
but they're,

129
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:39,850
they're,

130
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,550
they're good like short pieces.

131
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,121
Brian,

132
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:43,954
what the fuck?

133
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,561
What the fuck,

134
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:44,860
Brian?

135
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,693
I'd have no fucking fucking,

136
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,510
um,

137
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:46,961
but they're,

138
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,210
they're good short pieces that,

139
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,073
um,

140
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:50,711
they're,

141
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,161
you know,

142
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:51,301
they're,

143
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:53,110
they're really eye
opening and enlightening.

144
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:53,531
So the,

145
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,430
in disenfranchised,

146
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,050
they put out a lot of cool stuff.

147
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,370
And so they've gotten behind you.

148
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,320
I think they've put out some
of Graham Hancock stuff too,

149
00:03:59,321 --> 00:03:59,770
didn't they?

150
00:03:59,770 --> 00:03:59,891
Yeah,

151
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,480
that's what was kind of
like the Formula Ford.

152
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,260
His books don't like.

153
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,400
Their whole idea was,

154
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,600
I submit it to them,

155
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:08,700
this giant book I've been working
on 400 pages long with footnotes,

156
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,150
all this stuff about religion.

157
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:10,984
And they were like,

158
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,141
yeah,

159
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,010
that's sweet on the old,

160
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,110
but seriously,

161
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,740
can you give us something quick?

162
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,180
And that funny,

163
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,370
weird that has an impact
right away that people,

164
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:23,371
as you put it down the toilet and
get on something in dance back quick,

165
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,320
very difficult for people to discipline
themselves to read any serious piece of

166
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:30,760
work on anything.

167
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,260
It's just when you're just simply
stating the facts and documenting things,

168
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:35,740
it's,

169
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,041
you know,

170
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,510
it's oftentime a dry read.

171
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,820
Even though it's fascinating information.

172
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,400
They're really clever
in their idea of just,

173
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:42,700
you know,

174
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,020
figuring out a way to get it.

175
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,973
And then,

176
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,220
you know,

177
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,020
probably once people read this book,

178
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,340
get familiar with your writing,

179
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:48,850
get into,

180
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,150
then maybe they'll dive into like
some of your more serious stuff.

181
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:52,450
Right?

182
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:52,570
Yeah.

183
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,110
Even see it as a big large cause I had
even in the big book I add the one of the

184
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:59,380
chapters about the existence of God
beginning sweet though woman having a

185
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:00,350
screaming orgasm.

186
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:01,150
So I mean he's only,

187
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,910
it can only be socio Yosi right.

188
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,550
But I guess it was a,

189
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,890
the idea was not,

190
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:09,100
let's do something else that they
have a CD has going to 56 they are not

191
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,080
supposed to know it works well for them.

192
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,040
They want to do something or religion
and initially because I was attached to

193
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:15,731
the other project,

194
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:16,810
I was like ask her to wait.

195
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:17,490
I don't want to have to wait.

196
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,130
I want to,

197
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,140
when they told me the magic word advance,

198
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,243
suddenly I wasn't.

199
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,640
Yeah,

200
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,370
a little money always greases the wheels.

201
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:27,580
Like what do you want me to be weird
and funny and quick about religion?

202
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,330
No problem.

203
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,163
No problem.

204
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,681
Now you,

205
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:30,281
where are you from?

206
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:30,790
Italy.

207
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,250
Yeah.

208
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,130
What part of Italy are from mainland,

209
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,731
which by the way,

210
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:36,310
I want to apologize to your list
in cause I've been living here,

211
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:36,941
believe it or not,

212
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:39,880
I've been living here 20 years
and when I first moved there,

213
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,610
I swear I was speaking
almost decent English,

214
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,170
but then somebody brought to my attention
that many American women like my weird

215
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,150
Italian access,

216
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,760
he kept it simple.

217
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,890
A good one to have.

218
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:54,131
Matt,

219
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:54,611
I'll tell you what.

220
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:55,391
If I talked like you,

221
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,470
I'd keep that shit too.

222
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,800
I can understand you.

223
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,040
I mean

224
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,030
it's not like you're not,

225
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,890
it's not difficult to
understand is you're very clear.

226
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,570
You just have a very
distinct Italian flavor.

227
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:06,890
It's like reading cursive writing.

228
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,750
Exactly like cursive,

229
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:09,441
like typing.

230
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:10,060
If you,

231
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,290
if you had a typing program
that type in cursive

232
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,430
being understood versus me like my women.

233
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:16,641
No,

234
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:17,680
I think I take me like,

235
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,440
yeah,

236
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,730
that sounds like a lot of fun.

237
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:19,910
Yeah.

238
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,091
Yeah.

239
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:20,840
Women,

240
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,740
well men do too,

241
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:21,951
man.

242
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,220
You hear girl than English accent.

243
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:23,460
You're like,

244
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,020
Ooh,

245
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,801
listen to that.

246
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,634
You know.

247
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,290
No Australian English,

248
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,950
anything.

249
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,783
Yeah.

250
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,361
You know,

251
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:29,781
it's why?

252
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:30,420
Why is that?

253
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,253
What is this?

254
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,320
Everyone's dissatisfied
with what they are.

255
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,090
Everyone is looking for
something different.

256
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:36,530
Everyone wishes they were someone else.

257
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,950
Everyone sees the grass
greener heavily goes,

258
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,591
God damn,

259
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:40,401
I wish I had an accident.

260
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,234
Like that guy.

261
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,010
Hey works for me.

262
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:43,880
So I'm just,

263
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,350
it's one of the biggest sins,

264
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:45,620
right?

265
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,580
When you fake an accent,

266
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,860
can there be more douchey thing to do?

267
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,960
Like remember when Madonna
was talking English?

268
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,550
Do you remember that Brian?

269
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:52,970
Yeah.

270
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,370
She only did it for like a little bit
until people start calling her on it.

271
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,940
Brittany,

272
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,160
Brittany Spears also data
for a while it seems like,

273
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,303
but Britain,

274
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,800
nobody takes Britney spears.

275
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:01,634
Seriously.

276
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:01,941
You know,

277
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:03,350
Britney spears is a crazy person.

278
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:03,711
Madonna.

279
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,060
It's like a legit artist.

280
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,890
He's got a little carried away.

281
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:07,521
Yeah.

282
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:08,780
There's a lot of people that do that.

283
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,540
Why actually trained some sentences.

284
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,413
Just kid.

285
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,350
I have caffeine for awhile
and fake accident for this
is my sixth or seventh day

286
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:17,210
of no caffeine.

287
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,900
Yeah,

288
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,920
that's fascinating man.

289
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:19,930
Yeah.

290
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,420
Um,

291
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:20,901
yeah.

292
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:21,680
I'm a junkie.

293
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,640
I didn't even know it was a junkie

294
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,123
feel great now,

295
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,061
but,

296
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:26,201
uh,

297
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:28,280
I'm not convinced that I'm
going to stay off the coffee,

298
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:28,910
you know,

299
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,541
it's just like,

300
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,180
I now I know what it's like to be
like person hooked on cigarettes,

301
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,040
a cigarette.

302
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,170
I'm like,

303
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,450
no,

304
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,281
he just coffee right now.

305
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:34,521
You're like,

306
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:34,641
oh,

307
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:35,474
that looks delicious.

308
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:35,631
No,

309
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:37,460
because the physical poles on the same,

310
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,090
um,

311
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,920
the physical pole and I can substitute it.

312
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,050
Like I'll drink like a chai tea latte,

313
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,850
which has like the tiniest
amount of caffeine.

314
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:44,870
Nothing like a coffee,

315
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,910
but it's like a warm liquid per day.

316
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,870
Don't main lineup.

317
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,380
I just take them right
into my fucking veins.

318
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,460
Um,

319
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,120
but uh,

320
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,240
do you drink coffee brother?

321
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,490
You had a really good point.

322
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:57,140
You were saying before
the podcast about this,

323
00:07:57,141 --> 00:08:00,470
we were speaking about to use it the
same way as somebody who was used as hard

324
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:00,831
drugs,

325
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:01,130
you know,

326
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,640
dry.

327
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,460
I'll try just when I absolutely need it.

328
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,050
Then I'm wired for 10 hours.

329
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:06,321
I don't,

330
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:07,310
I'm not even going to getting coffee.

331
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,320
I'm just going to have a
double espresso when I need it.

332
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:10,690
Just go with you.

333
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,063
[inaudible]

334
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,610
speak 50 miles an hour for an hour and
then pass out and not actually for three

335
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:16,821
months.

336
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:17,470
That's the Harry.

337
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,530
Such a smart move.

338
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,530
That's such a smart move.

339
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,580
The reason why I did this and
the first was because I took,

340
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,620
I took a few days off just randomly,

341
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,790
just like I,

342
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,090
you know,

343
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,980
decided that just didn't want any coffee.

344
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:30,350
And then I had a cup of
coffee and Oh my God,

345
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,300
my heart was pounding and I was like,

346
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:32,571
wow,

347
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:33,221
this is crazy.

348
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,760
We just took a couple days,

349
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,840
maybe three days,

350
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:36,674
and I was,

351
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,071
you know,

352
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:37,430
my,

353
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,500
my tolerance had broken down.

354
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:39,650
Right?

355
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,130
I don't know why or how that happens
that quick or if I just got a really good

356
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:44,300
batch at Starbucks.

357
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,650
And then I started thinking about it like,

358
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:46,100
wow,

359
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,210
how much resources is my body using
to fight off the stimulant every day?

360
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:51,320
And how normal is this?

361
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,621
You know,

362
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:52,940
how healthy is this?

363
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,540
It can't be.

364
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,320
And I get the same feeling like when,

365
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:58,740
when I'm drinking coffee that I do when
I smoked too much cigarettes where it

366
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:01,470
feels like my body is like craving it.

367
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:03,240
But I get a headache kind of from it.

368
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,250
Like I could probably do it.

369
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:04,450
Right.

370
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,283
Yeah.

371
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:05,790
Poison.

372
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,020
Yeah.

373
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,600
And you're,

374
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:06,841
you're,

375
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:07,890
you're addicted,

376
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,640
you know?

377
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:08,930
Yeah.

378
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,560
Most certainly am addicted to coffee.

379
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,090
I see it and I smell it,

380
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,470
but I can get around it with
t and t doesn't wire me.

381
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,323
Doesn't work for me.

382
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,150
It doesn't ice tea.

383
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:19,830
I drink shit loads of ice tea.

384
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:22,320
But that is like as
bad as drinking coffee,

385
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:22,681
I think.

386
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:23,041
Really?

387
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:23,260
Yeah,

388
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,390
there's coffee,

389
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,960
but you know,

390
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,370
you could drink herbal tea too.

391
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,270
I like herbal tea.

392
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:27,691
You know,

393
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:28,380
you could have like,

394
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,681
you know,

395
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:28,921
there's,

396
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:31,890
there's a lot of different types of
herbal tea that have no caffeine in them.

397
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,810
For me it's like tape Pletcher
our buddy said it best.

398
00:09:34,811 --> 00:09:35,370
She said it's like,

399
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,051
drink a cup of coffee.

400
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:37,320
It's like having a warm hug.

401
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,700
You know?

402
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:38,941
It's like,

403
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:41,820
I'm not really looking to
be wired from the coffee.

404
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:44,160
I just want some warm
liquid that tastes good.

405
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,810
I like the taste of coffee.

406
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,460
Yeah.

407
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,460
I think you need more love,

408
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:47,760
man.

409
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,450
I need more love.

410
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,470
I think you've got a good point,

411
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:49,980
brother.

412
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,150
I liked the way this guy thinks.

413
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,740
So you a,

414
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:56,190
you wrote this book on religion and
you wrote also a book on martial arts.

415
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:56,791
So what you and I,

416
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,020
I have a

417
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,801
lot in common man.

418
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:58,634
We have a lot of uh,

419
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,361
very,

420
00:09:59,361 --> 00:09:59,870
uh,

421
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,770
similar interests.

422
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,340
Um,

423
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,810
w how did you get involved in religion?

424
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:03,740
Were you raised religious?

425
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,170
No.

426
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,820
Um,

427
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,001
no.

428
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:05,420
I just,

429
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,140
I'm fascinated by it because you
see how much he means to people.

430
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,120
I would match their whole
world view their life,

431
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:12,140
their priorities,

432
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:12,980
who they marry,

433
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,420
who they want to out with.

434
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:17,450
Everything depends on the kind of
stuff they put in their head based on

435
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,021
religions.

436
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:19,820
So it's powerful stuff.

437
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,410
It's amazing that it's still works.

438
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,280
This is a 2011.

439
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:23,411
It's,

440
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:23,750
it's,

441
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,290
you know,

442
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:24,740
with,

443
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,920
it's very difficult to have
pure objective thinking.

444
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,911
But then again,

445
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:29,121
you know,

446
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:30,710
the thing is the staff that dry.

447
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,430
So these is that people are scared of
dying and rightfully so because you know,

448
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:35,670
we don't go and throw object shape.

449
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,940
We don't know anything about
anything really about that.

450
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,141
I'm like,

451
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:40,700
you only verse works just died.

452
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,640
So we should say rest in
peace to Patrice O'Neil,

453
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,680
who's a great guy and a great
comedian and an awesome dude,

454
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:48,830
awesome thinker.

455
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,870
Cause a warm friendly guy.

456
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,021
Oh,

457
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:51,460
we'd love,

458
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,440
always love seeing that guy
and I'm going to miss him.

459
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,400
I miss him a lot.

460
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,503
It was a,

461
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,900
it was a great comedian who's a great guy,

462
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,710
you know,

463
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,543
just sucks.

464
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,320
It just,

465
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,260
he had poor health,

466
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:03,531
you know,

467
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:05,560
he had diabetes and uh,

468
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,243
yeah,

469
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,370
I guess he just didn't
really take care of himself.

470
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,400
He ate too much and he wound
up having a stroke and um,

471
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,600
then he was in a coma for
a little while I guess.

472
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:18,170
And then,

473
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,470
you know,

474
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,940
he was a,

475
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,950
it was really difficult
to get the information out
because the family was sort

476
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:23,810
of protecting it and rightly so.

477
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,850
We don't know exactly the details of it.

478
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,281
So,

479
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:26,720
uh,

480
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,730
this is all really what I'm repeating.

481
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:30,080
It's just stuff that I
heard on the Internet.

482
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:31,760
I have and I'm so sad about it.

483
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:33,830
I didn't want to call anybody
and talk to anybody about it.

484
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:34,664
You know,

485
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,500
I talked to Stan hope about it today.

486
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,470
We talked to for this deck.

487
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,630
It's a minute.

488
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,440
We can,

489
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,690
we can you say it sucks.

490
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:43,220
We both just said that we didn't,

491
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,360
we really didn't even say
anything other than a socks.

492
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:45,951
So I asked him,

493
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:46,101
I go,

494
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:46,934
did you hear about Patrice?

495
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:47,841
He goes,

496
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:48,060
yeah,

497
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,830
socks.

498
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,071
I go,

499
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:49,500
yeah.

500
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,333
Socks.

501
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,860
Can't even say anything else.

502
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:51,981
I'm,

503
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:52,320
what am I?

504
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,153
Anything else has,

505
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,240
is going to happen to all of us one day.

506
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,010
It's like the real moment of actually
dealing with loss is really intense.

507
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:00,941
You know,

508
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:01,091
it's,

509
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:02,710
it's real hard to deal with Patrice.

510
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:03,544
We're going to mess you,

511
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,141
miss you a lot,

512
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:05,974
man.

513
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,181
He was,

514
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:09,940
he's one of those comics
date that was so quick.

515
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,380
Like just seeing them on
opion Anthony all the time.

516
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,960
That was the one thing that I could just,

517
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,510
he who was really fast and hilarious,

518
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,300
like how powerful,

519
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,330
he's a comic man.

520
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,190
He's a real comic.

521
00:12:19,191 --> 00:12:22,360
Did my favorite Patrice thing
wasn't even have him doing standup.

522
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,790
My favorite purchase thing was him on a,

523
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,420
um,

524
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,010
one of those like Fox rate.

525
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:31,840
It was either Fox News or one of those
talk shows where someone had said

526
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:33,820
something inappropriate
and gotten in trouble.

527
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,650
I believe it was like opie and Anthony,

528
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,461
they,

529
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:40,390
I think it was the incident where they
had some crackhead on their show and the

530
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:41,224
crack head,

531
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:46,270
which talked about he wanted a rape
Condoleezza Rice and like it was,

532
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:46,991
it was just,

533
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:49,000
they had a crazy person
on their show and like,

534
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,640
and they got suspended for it.

535
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,800
I think that was what he was defending.

536
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:58,801
But there was a woman on who was with
him and this woman was like talking about

537
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:00,190
how you shouldn't have said this,

538
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,033
you shouldn't have done that.

539
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,250
And Patrice has just clown her.

540
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:03,701
He's just like,

541
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:04,960
you don't understand funny.

542
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,130
You guys understand funny.

543
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,540
It all comes from the same place.

544
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,600
And the way he said it,

545
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:13,090
it was so honest and so well thought
out and it made them look so silly.

546
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,080
It made people criticizing people who
stepped across the line with comedy

547
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,370
criticizing them,

548
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:18,761
you know,

549
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:20,340
as if what they're comedy was.

550
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,600
It was like an actual statement
of their real beliefs.

551
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,560
Now it's comedy,

552
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:23,801
you know,

553
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:27,250
and it all comes from the same place
that the ability or the attempt rather to

554
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:28,420
try to make people laugh.

555
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,160
And he broke it down so well.

556
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:31,720
And it was so funny the way he did it,

557
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:33,190
the way he handled it was so brilliant.

558
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,900
He was just a real quick guy,

559
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,170
a real unique thinker and a guy who,

560
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,621
you know,

561
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:40,390
I always really love to see.

562
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,520
And whenever I ran into
him I was always happy.

563
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,330
You know,

564
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,790
comedians are a rare animal.

565
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,960
There's not that many of us.

566
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,660
It's just the video right here that,

567
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:48,990
that,

568
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,890
that you're talking about.

569
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,550
Um,

570
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,600
I don't think so.

571
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,021
No,

572
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:53,410
it was,

573
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:53,681
yeah,

574
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:54,280
that's it.

575
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,610
Yeah,

576
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,430
absolutely.

577
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:55,850
[inaudible]

578
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,220
clown,

579
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,790
this lady,

580
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,881
oh,

581
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:57,660
sorry.

582
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,930
She took part in the recent protests
calling for radio stations to shop,

583
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,140
stop supporting negative language in
music and talk radio and also our favorite

584
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,260
standup comic.

585
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:08,580
Patrice O'neil.

586
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,090
Patrice are ONA next.

587
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:12,691
Oh,

588
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:13,500
nice.

589
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,251
I hope Davey.

590
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:15,740
I was Jamie and I was then Lucy job.

591
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,980
Well,

592
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,800
Imus.

593
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,450
It's funny,

594
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,110
this is thing I have.

595
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:20,130
I don't know her,

596
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:20,820
but I'm uh,

597
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,730
I'm assuming that she has
nothing to do with funny.

598
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,040
So I'm gonna speak as the expert on funny,

599
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,551
funny.

600
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:28,740
People should just be
left to try to be funny,

601
00:14:28,741 --> 00:14:29,131
but it would,

602
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:29,964
if they're not funny,

603
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,470
then you made a mistake.

604
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,190
But how many,

605
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:32,521
listen,

606
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:34,290
how many times has the unfunny,

607
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,590
how many unfunny rape jokes lead to rape?

608
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,100
Like,

609
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,440
I don't know how many
jokes about rape there are.

610
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,190
There's a lot,

611
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,290
but you're not funny.

612
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,470
You're world is to Mexico.

613
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,070
Next one.

614
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,903
The big story.

615
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,350
My world is people trying to be funny.

616
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,400
You think it's okay to try
to make jokes about rape?

617
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,271
I'm diabetic.

618
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:54,140
I make fun of that.

619
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,333
I'm a victim.

620
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,370
I might lose a toe to make funny.

621
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,930
I'm trying to make fun of anything.

622
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:00,200
I,

623
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,390
I think I can make fun of Sonia.

624
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,900
You know what's happening now.

625
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,510
It's the marketplace.

626
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,903
Okay.

627
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,890
Is deciding what's appropriate
and what's not appropriate.

628
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,780
I think the nation is just tired.

629
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,100
There's a new mood in the nation,

630
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,661
the nation.

631
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:18,021
You know what?

632
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:19,430
We're tired of things that are just,

633
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:20,300
the nation is painful.

634
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:21,134
And you mom,

635
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,071
I'm not the nation.

636
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:23,600
I'm just speaking for me and sunny.

637
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,240
You're speaking for the
nation or you speak it for,

638
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:26,871
yeah.

639
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:27,351
You know why?

640
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:32,351
Because I remember six years ago doing
something against Anthony opening because

641
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:39,161
they were just so outrageous and they're
violent images to the neighborhood out

642
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:42,560
to women was just uncalled for.

643
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,340
And now,

644
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,170
now I think people don't try to be funny.

645
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,700
I think now people in this
country trying to be higher.

646
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,121
You know what?

647
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,380
I don't care if they
were trying to be funny.

648
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,260
That's what I'm saying.

649
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,830
And tell you in that business,

650
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,900
I've been into your show once and
it wasn't very funny being a woman

651
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,683
like me.

652
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,170
I was in the paper with her
and the joke is hilarious.

653
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,370
Called the angry pirate.

654
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,730
And The lady who wrote it in the,

655
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,210
in her outrage didn't
even know what it meant.

656
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,750
And anybody who read it laugh
cause they know what funny.

657
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,550
You're not living in the context of funny.

658
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:17,390
You'll get all these guns have every
right to be as funny as they want.

659
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,670
They can go out and try to
be as funny as they want.

660
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:20,570
Make as much money,

661
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,490
make as much money being
as funny as they want.

662
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,750
This is what's happening.

663
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,790
There is a change in this country.

664
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,090
People are realizing they
have an opportunity to speak
out and advertise their

665
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,463
listening.

666
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,440
You're not going to get
paid as much money anymore.

667
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,731
That's what it is.

668
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:38,564
The marketplace,

669
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,260
they'd been on a tear lately.

670
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,030
Are they cleaning house or is
this the PC cops run a month.

671
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,811
You know what it is,

672
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:48,644
John.

673
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,731
You know what it is?

674
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:52,740
Why you reading that paper
is the PC cops run a mug?

675
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,010
Of course she is.

676
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:55,550
She's,

677
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,480
she has an entire encyclopedia
of her stance on it,

678
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:00,940
but it's no passion involved.

679
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:01,820
It's not a real,

680
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,500
this is just what she has to say.

681
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,380
We are outraged and fired.

682
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:08,420
He's an insightful main calling.

683
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,433
I'm outraged.

684
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,353
I am.

685
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,933
You know what?

686
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,090
These people in this country,

687
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:22,820
here's what,

688
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,750
here's my question.

689
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,780
How can you justify a bad joke?

690
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,280
A joke that isn't funny.

691
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,091
Oh wait,

692
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:29,270
wait,

693
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,481
wait.

694
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,314
Go ahead and attempt it.

695
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,790
That isn't funny.

696
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,840
Doesn't get any laughs
and is about raping a,

697
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,710
the first black woman to ever becomes a
secretary of state in the United States.

698
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:40,544
Throw that at me

699
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,930
trying to fight for the joke.

700
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,930
May or may funny jokes and unfunny jokes,

701
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,420
uh,

702
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,560
uh,

703
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,300
come of the same birth date.

704
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,521
You,

705
00:17:51,521 --> 00:17:54,240
you don't know if anything
is going to be funny.

706
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,940
You should attend to be
able to make anything funny.

707
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,770
Think a joke about rape is
doomed to be not fun as possible,

708
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,663
but I've heard him,

709
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,070
you heard the funny rape joke.

710
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,740
I say a couple of watch my feel special.

711
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,843
Pretty good

712
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,600
that if you're having sex with a woman,

713
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,990
oh,

714
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,860
doggie style.

715
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,753
And if you

716
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,303
just the right,

717
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,380
it's a Jackie late and I and kick her in
the Shin as she walks around like urgh.

718
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,930
It's the angry pyre.

719
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,330
That's what she was trying to say.

720
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,340
Hitting her in the back of her head.

721
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:28,170
Her body don't be punched,

722
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,320
which will then why are you laughing?

723
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,280
It's called humor that she has no one.

724
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:42,281
And the same problem that opie and
Anthony that you can't say anything on the

725
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:44,300
hair to say anything you want.

726
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:45,180
It might not be funny.

727
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:46,110
You might get in trouble for it,

728
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:48,270
but you should be able to be attempted.

729
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,760
And plus when is a crazy,

730
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,030
but I'm going to get an
opportunity to rate the president,

731
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,720
the president's wife,

732
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,573
John,

733
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,340
trying to be funny.

734
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,680
All right,

735
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:57,990
Patrice,

736
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,290
why aren't I hearing now Sharpton
complain about this thing involving,

737
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,130
cause it wasn't involving a young uh,

738
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,860
black women.

739
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,150
Whoa.

740
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,900
This evolving in a very
prominent black woman.

741
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,240
Well where was she throwing
during young black?

742
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,850
Everybody has their agenda
because there I was there.

743
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,030
Oh,

744
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,690
I'm sorry.

745
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:12,861
Yeah,

746
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:13,110
right.

747
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,720
Excuse me.

748
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,700
Know Why am I not here?

749
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,280
Cause it doesn't concern him.

750
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,150
It's not concerned him as black is,

751
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,980
you know it.

752
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,340
Come on now you know what Al had,

753
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Al Sharpton has his agenda and it was
perfect for al young black women and now

754
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:29,520
she's representing just women in general.

755
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,060
She's not representing the nappy hope.

756
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:31,251
Ah,

757
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:35,250
she's representing just the whole
and that she has nothing to do.

758
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,703
Just the whole

759
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:38,460
tone.

760
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,090
You know what?

761
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,090
Women have been abused publicly in the
media for too long and people are tired

762
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:45,660
of it.

763
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,660
This has been a beautiful response
of just the general public saying to

764
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:51,684
advertisers,

765
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,070
where your consumers,

766
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,851
she's awesome.

767
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:56,550
Want to have to avoid
everything in the street.

768
00:19:56,551 --> 00:20:00,450
We don't want to have to worry about what
radio station we turn on and there is

769
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:03,570
some really derogatory violent,

770
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,820
you're going to get to
deal with information.

771
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,140
Um,

772
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,140
Ma'am is second hand from someone making
you aware that someone may have said

773
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:13,530
something that you should be upset about?

774
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,770
It's a shame y'all could
stitch a sweet deal.

775
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,030
The people you represent on all victims.

776
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,321
Theresa,

777
00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:19,591
Neil,

778
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:20,424
thank you very much.

779
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:21,981
Thanks for both of you.

780
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:22,640
We appreciate

781
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,640
the time for big love like dumb people
who talk ridiculous and try to sound

782
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:28,744
intelligent.

783
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,531
I think she's like,

784
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:31,690
it was speaking for the entire country.

785
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,730
We and we are fed up and we're like,

786
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:33,970
whoa,

787
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:34,331
whoa,

788
00:20:34,331 --> 00:20:35,110
whoa.

789
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,100
How preposterous.

790
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:36,731
How beautiful.

791
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:37,630
Was he in that though?

792
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,951
Yeah,

793
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:38,220
it was.

794
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,070
It was beautiful.

795
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,120
I love that dude.

796
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,550
He is who?

797
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,533
Messy Buddy.

798
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,510
That's it.

799
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,260
That's it.

800
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,100
Rest in peace.

801
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,420
See Ya on the other side.

802
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,660
Peace out.

803
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,493
Alright Daniel,

804
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,300
back to you brother.

805
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,133
Yup.

806
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,860
Um,

807
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,380
so Danielle,

808
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,590
how'd he say it?

809
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,423
Danielle.

810
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,643
Danielle.

811
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,263
Danielle.

812
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,143
Slick bastard.

813
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,770
I love the fact that
you admitted he kept it.

814
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,480
He kept that accent.

815
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,643
That's fantastic.

816
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,551
So,

817
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:06,761
um,

818
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:07,990
I don't know how we got into this,

819
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,580
about people being afraid to die.

820
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:10,270
That's what it was.

821
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:10,930
And then uh,

822
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,070
yeah cause I mean wait through legion.

823
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,740
If you read even like early 99
that it's people are sinking.

824
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,071
Okay.

825
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:16,250
Now we modernity,

826
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:18,580
you are in a mother and
ward and more secular word.

827
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,270
Oh the kind of more
traditional superstitions are
all going to phase out and

828
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,520
immediately makes sense on the surface.

829
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:28,240
But not really because until you have the
answers to the things that make people

830
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:29,230
really freak out.

831
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,190
Dying.

832
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:30,880
Grief,

833
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,713
what the hell?

834
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,081
You know,

835
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:32,591
cause I mean,

836
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,960
our life is so short and we don't know
Jack Shit about before her afternoon

837
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,940
until you give some people some answers.

838
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,870
People are not comfortable
having no answers,

839
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,290
no matter how bullshit
does answers are they,

840
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,080
they need them.

841
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,080
It's almost like religion is some sort
of an evolutionary device like a bridge

842
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,980
to to take us from being monkeys
to being enlightened beings.

843
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:57,190
Like we need some horse
shit to get us through this.

844
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,060
We need a believe.

845
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,840
Otherwise.

846
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,290
You know,

847
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,930
the idea of no one ever wants to think of,

848
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,591
you know,

849
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:02,861
the,

850
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:07,861
the concept of life being that it may
be that you have lived this exact life

851
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:10,810
before and you will live it over and
over again until you get it right.

852
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,230
And the idea that this
could go on into infinity,

853
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:14,801
you know,

854
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,050
and that might be what life really is.

855
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:17,740
And we,

856
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,570
we don't think of it as being possible
because it's too hard for our minds to

857
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:26,680
wrap around and too alien to
what we absolutely know to exist.

858
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:27,190
Like,

859
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,490
you know,

860
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,990
birth and death and you know,

861
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,130
having a certain amount of time here to
get things done and seeing people die,

862
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,150
you know?

863
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,050
But the actual possibility is almost like,

864
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:39,520
it's too fucked up for us.

865
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:44,521
So somebody had to invent religion in
order to just patch up the road till we

866
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:45,880
make it there.

867
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,001
Yeah.

868
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:48,340
Cause I mean in reality
we don't really control,

869
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,430
you match anything your life and we're
conscious and where cultures are.

870
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,650
So that's a quagmire.

871
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,353
The universe,

872
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,920
the universe itself.

873
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:57,131
You know,

874
00:22:57,131 --> 00:23:01,900
I had a bit and one of my past alums about
if you ever are starting to take your

875
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:02,734
life seriously,

876
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,980
just stand out and go outside and just
look up at space and just really wrap

877
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:08,800
your head.

878
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,551
I mean everybody looks at,

879
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:10,350
Oh there's a stars,

880
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,260
stars are bright tonight.

881
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,320
But very few people
actually look up and go,

882
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:14,860
wow,

883
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,170
you know that that literally is infinity.

884
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:18,790
Like we're floating and infinity.

885
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,980
And it's the majority of what I see,

886
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:21,191
you know,

887
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,510
all around the top.

888
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,360
It's easier to see infinity
than it is to see the ground.

889
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:30,340
I mean I have more view of the infinity
like and it's amazing how rarely that

890
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:32,230
comes up that no one,

891
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,190
no one talks about it.

892
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:33,990
And it almost,

893
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,823
it's too much.

894
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,680
So we just sort of accept that we live
in space and except that we look at the

895
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:39,514
clouds.

896
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,930
What is the first religion?

897
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:42,400
What's the first known religion?

898
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,350
I mean if you look at the,

899
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,400
I have a chapter in there that I had
half of the fun of doing this book was

900
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:52,300
coming up with a title schools in
like in a few words you just throw out

901
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,740
something outrageous and where that
gets things going and let me see if I

902
00:23:56,741 --> 00:24:00,410
remember what this one exact was because
I had a blast with the origins of

903
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:01,244
religion.

904
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,150
Let me

905
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,430
when will this book we
released should be these week?

906
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,980
This week I think is [inaudible]
dot com you can pick it up

907
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:07,901
and then Amazon,

908
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:08,560
Amazon,

909
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,280
the whole,

910
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,521
Oh yeah,

911
00:24:09,521 --> 00:24:09,971
this one.

912
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:14,370
I have a chapter entitled mammoth
porn and the Caveman see pulp.

913
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,850
The origins of religion,

914
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,260
because the very first evidence that
archaeology suggest these may be the

915
00:24:20,261 --> 00:24:22,060
beginning of religious behavior.

916
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,830
They see these cave paintings laugh by
cave man were the main things that these

917
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:30,580
guys who are drawing where hunting
scenes and animals having sex,

918
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,510
the idea of being these guys who are like
doing these rituals because their life

919
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:38,650
was on the line to ensure success
in the hand and then you know,

920
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:41,320
animals are data so you need to make
sure there are more for the next time

921
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:41,681
around.

922
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:44,590
So you're trying to send out the
vibes of the animals have sex,

923
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,480
there's more of them and so on.

924
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,620
And what they would do it,

925
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,070
again,

926
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,480
this is pure speculation
because it would have,

927
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:49,931
how knows,

928
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:53,230
but it's a fan speculation
archeologist suggest that a,

929
00:24:53,231 --> 00:24:57,400
they would have these rituals in front
of this painting where they mimic Hanton

930
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,660
and then they would mimic,

931
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,200
you know,

932
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,260
caveman and cave woman every
grindy sweaty dance scene,

933
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:04,300
semi sacks,

934
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,370
kind of like modern hip hop kind of thing.

935
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,040
And that would be the beginning of at
Allegion because they are trying to

936
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:13,870
influence the universe so that the
animals have more sex and there's more of

937
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:15,280
them to come along the next time.

938
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,150
Wow.

939
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,260
They thought it could be
thought of bullshit cause I
mean I would the you're not

940
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:24,270
really an archeologist basing it on
three pieces of information left 15,000

941
00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:25,061
years ago.

942
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:26,170
But it sounds fun

943
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:26,631
and we,

944
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:29,250
we should clarify that you actually
know what you're talking about.

945
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:32,520
Unlike most of the time
that these discussions get
brought up on this podcast.

946
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:34,290
You're actually a professor you teach.

947
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,160
Where do you teach at?

948
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,950
I teach at Santa Monica
College and Cal State language.

949
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:38,731
And uh,

950
00:25:38,731 --> 00:25:40,080
what is your education?

951
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,270
I started out,

952
00:25:42,271 --> 00:25:43,620
when I came here I did a,

953
00:25:43,621 --> 00:25:48,621
I did my ba in anthropology but then
I hated it and then I did the Nma in

954
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:52,030
American Indian studies
of all sayings and uh,

955
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,070
I need a second.

956
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:54,930
The main he story and I really,

957
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:58,170
I mean bottom line is there was mandatory
military service in Italy and you

958
00:25:58,171 --> 00:26:00,170
could be fair eighth
as long as you wearing

959
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:00,571
cool.

960
00:26:00,571 --> 00:26:01,404
So I was like,

961
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,610
I'll do another masters.

962
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,360
No problem.

963
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,193
I just,

964
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,000
we'll do the Indian studies
wants to be an interesting,

965
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,550
that's fun.

966
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:07,730
It was.

967
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,490
Or what the fuck.

968
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,960
I got really into American Indian
history a few years back and I read a,

969
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,080
a quite a few books on it.

970
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,870
It's an amazing case of genocide.

971
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:16,921
I mean,

972
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:20,970
people really can't even wrap their head
around how many American Indians died.

973
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,450
90% of our whole
population of wipe it out.

974
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,410
And that's how it's horrific,

975
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:26,610
horrific stories.

976
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,241
You know,

977
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:32,241
I read some soldiers of counts of what
they did to American Indians and uh,

978
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,150
it's uh,

979
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,050
it's horrific.

980
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:34,321
You know,

981
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:37,320
it got really terrifying
like serial killer stuff.

982
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,281
You know what they would do,

983
00:26:38,281 --> 00:26:39,720
just heartless Ruth,

984
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:40,031
like the,

985
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,850
they treated them like they were not,

986
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,020
not even vermin,

987
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,510
you know,

988
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,010
a lot of

989
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,180
that is actually tied to religion
because the first way to um,

990
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,640
kind of dehumanizing
somebody is what I mean,

991
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,380
we throw the Western religions,

992
00:26:52,381 --> 00:26:54,630
they have this division
between God and the devil.

993
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:57,030
Absolute good and absolute
from heaven and hell.

994
00:26:57,031 --> 00:27:00,450
So there are the good guys are follow
God and then there's everybody else.

995
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:00,631
Cause,

996
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:02,370
I mean if there's only one right way,

997
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,900
then the idea is anybody who doesn't
follow hours by default is on the wrong

998
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:07,710
side.

999
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,050
And if you think of that a
couple of steps for it or done,

1000
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,280
then that's what it leads to.

1001
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:11,561
You know,

1002
00:27:11,561 --> 00:27:14,910
in the idea of you guys are the servants
of the day while they are not really

1003
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:15,750
human anyway,

1004
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,740
this low 30 new left and right
is it's an act of justice as the,

1005
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,773
that's why I don't mind.

1006
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,690
I use these in class all the
time cause I have a blast.

1007
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,530
Uh,

1008
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,161
everybody,

1009
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:27,810
even if they never read any of this stuff,

1010
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,350
I've heard about the whole uh,

1011
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,520
story about Moses and the
10 commandments and so on.

1012
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,050
Then after that I ask my students about
what happens right after that story.

1013
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:38,760
Cause that's where it gets
juicy and they're like,

1014
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:38,971
ah,

1015
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:39,480
I don't know.

1016
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:39,970
Something,

1017
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,210
it wasn't golden calf or some crap.

1018
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:43,044
Like the,

1019
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,960
some of the Jews are not
worshiping the one God.

1020
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:46,231
I'm like,

1021
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:46,471
yeah,

1022
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:46,740
yeah,

1023
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,221
that's right.

1024
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:48,660
And what does Moses do about it?

1025
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:50,430
Right after getting the 10 Commandments?

1026
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,043
I Dunno.

1027
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,140
Like he gathers,

1028
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:53,580
there's a,

1029
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:53,911
the law,

1030
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:54,331
your list,

1031
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:55,021
you know the streak,

1032
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,270
monotheistic people who
are still on his side.

1033
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:57,991
He tell them,

1034
00:27:57,991 --> 00:27:58,470
hey guys,

1035
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,100
you know,

1036
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,270
those are our friends.

1037
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,200
They're our neighbors.

1038
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:02,250
Some of them are family,

1039
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:03,750
but they're worshiping other gods.

1040
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,480
We can't have that.

1041
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:07,740
So you know what to do,

1042
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:08,700
get your weapons.

1043
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,730
Let's go from one side to the camp
of the either and killed them all.

1044
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,980
And so right after the 10 commandments,

1045
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:16,340
you have a nice story of
some 3000 Jewish tribes.

1046
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:20,610
Then being hacked to that
by the monotheistic Jews
against the polities stick.

1047
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,200
Joe's,

1048
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,680
Jesus Christ.

1049
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,760
But I lead those mass
sucker right off the bat.

1050
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,640
Wow.

1051
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,250
They are like Moses or nope.

1052
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,020
That is ridiculous.

1053
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,380
That's why.

1054
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,360
That's amazing.

1055
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,171
It's amazing.

1056
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,310
And this is the Old Testament,

1057
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:37,910
the old testament.

1058
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:38,743
So freaky.

1059
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,170
The Old Testament is
just filled with freaky.

1060
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:44,800
It's like one of the most
psychedelic bizarre books.

1061
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,570
You know,

1062
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:45,810
the,

1063
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,091
the,

1064
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,760
just all the stories.

1065
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:51,250
It just genesis and it's so
much in there that's like,

1066
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:52,180
wait a minute,

1067
00:28:52,181 --> 00:28:52,511
what?

1068
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:55,180
There was a fucking talking snake like,

1069
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:55,931
come on man.

1070
00:28:55,931 --> 00:29:00,370
The devil appeared as a talking snake
and talked him into eating a fruit.

1071
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,420
It was just a piece of fruit.

1072
00:29:01,421 --> 00:29:02,320
That's all they had to do.

1073
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,280
Just a piece of fruit.

1074
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,153
That's hilarious.

1075
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,070
You know that God is just,

1076
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,270
he's rules are soft.

1077
00:29:07,271 --> 00:29:08,081
Fucking serious.

1078
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,310
You eat my fucking apples,

1079
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:10,144
bitch.

1080
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,620
I'm not just going to punish you.

1081
00:29:11,621 --> 00:29:15,160
I'm going to punish every fucking
person from now till eternity.

1082
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,300
As long as their people,

1083
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,260
the people are fucked
because one dumb bitch,

1084
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,103
eight an APP.

1085
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,430
It's my fucking apple.

1086
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,291
That amazing.

1087
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,160
You don't understand.

1088
00:29:24,161 --> 00:29:24,551
Funny.

1089
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:26,880
I'm afraid you got your mellow out.

1090
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,061
Should God,

1091
00:29:28,061 --> 00:29:29,110
what the fuck man?

1092
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,471
God,

1093
00:29:29,471 --> 00:29:32,680
you need to smoke a joint and
use some of your own creation.

1094
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,790
It's amazing how ruthless the the
like when you go back in history,

1095
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:38,130
how ruthless God's war.

1096
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,110
Absolutely.

1097
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,270
No,

1098
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,790
that's why if it cracks me up when you,

1099
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:41,920
we like could he Stanford,

1100
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:42,010
the

1101
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,660
mantle is complaining about Hollywood,

1102
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:46,510
about all the sex and violence
because if you look at the Bible,

1103
00:29:46,511 --> 00:29:47,344
there's,

1104
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,371
I mean it's awesome.

1105
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:51,490
There's more sex and violence seemed
to Bible than any Hollywood movie I can

1106
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:51,941
think of.

1107
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:52,121
You know,

1108
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:55,480
he gets so insanely graphic
that is like Dame really,

1109
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,373
this is what,

1110
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:57,530
yeah,

1111
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,331
it's amazing too.

1112
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:03,331
How many of the stories are like really
similar to all older stories from other

1113
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:05,404
religions?

1114
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:05,831
You know,

1115
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:06,620
like the one,

1116
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,620
the one that always got me was the epic
of Gilgamesh and the story of Noah Arc,

1117
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:13,870
they're so similar and it's like,

1118
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,250
it's like really,

1119
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:15,760
it's like,

1120
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,390
I wonder what really
happened and my speculations,

1121
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:24,280
totally speculation as there probably
was some sort of a great catastrophe a

1122
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,270
long time ago.

1123
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,750
But of course in every
giant tsunami or flood,

1124
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,730
it's not everyone that dies.

1125
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,070
Some people are going to live
and the people that live,

1126
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:36,010
they're going to have to have some
story for how they lived and you know,

1127
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:39,430
a couple of generations in when
everybody's still live in like a monkey,

1128
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:39,911
you know,

1129
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:41,380
running around collecting fruit,

1130
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:44,320
trying to get their goats to fuck
so they can kill them and eat them,

1131
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:44,711
you know,

1132
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:46,430
and just wondering how they got,

1133
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,800
why we seem really intelligent.

1134
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,480
How did we get to this shitty point?

1135
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,950
Like w how can we now you fucks and
figured out tools or clothing or houses or

1136
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:54,784
anything yet.

1137
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,330
Well,

1138
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:59,890
a long time ago Noah was the only person
and we are the child children of Noah.

1139
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,930
It doesn't even take into
account that you know how many,

1140
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,310
how many people were with Noah?

1141
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,570
Everybody came from Noah.

1142
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,980
We're wears black people come from,

1143
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:06,910
what about Chinese people?

1144
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,220
Yeah.

1145
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,930
How's that happen?

1146
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,220
How long does it take before,

1147
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,340
I mean Noah only supposedly it
was a couple thousand years ago.

1148
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:12,850
Right?

1149
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,710
What was that 3000 years ago
or something like that though.

1150
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:16,470
You have like 6 billion people.

1151
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:20,080
It was that possible that says luck
is that this is the dumbest shit ever,

1152
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,320
but it's probably the original
story was probably an actual event.

1153
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,000
Like I think most of those,

1154
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,190
those depictions were actual events.

1155
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,750
It just got distorted.

1156
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:32,790
You know the,

1157
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:32,991
the,

1158
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:33,281
the,

1159
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:33,730
the,

1160
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,660
the telephone game.

1161
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:39,130
Like you tell a friend and he tells a
friend or was it called top operator?

1162
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:39,701
Yeah.

1163
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:42,120
I mean by the time you get
to the last person and this,

1164
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,610
you know,

1165
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,040
that's actually finding out your butt and
get up because he's one of the ways in

1166
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,850
which I can got a sources.

1167
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:49,480
So when we talk about religion
in class and I bring gap,

1168
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:50,560
when I speak off the Bible,

1169
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,401
I tell them,

1170
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:51,760
you know,

1171
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,490
how do you come out?

1172
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,070
How do you know that
this is the real stuff?

1173
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:54,581
And I tell them,

1174
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:54,880
you know,

1175
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,770
really we have been talking about an
oral traditions for generations before

1176
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:01,620
anybody write them down
and they saw asking him,

1177
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,310
have you guys ever played
over eight 30 or nine?

1178
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,210
Do you know how that works?

1179
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:05,920
And then you ended up so picture play,

1180
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,810
operate there for maybe 50
hours and then you had a cord,

1181
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:09,700
all the answers.

1182
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,390
And then 200 years later somebody come
around and look at the answer and decide

1183
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:15,160
which ones are true
and which ones are not.

1184
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,140
And that's the word of God for you.

1185
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,351
Yeah.

1186
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:21,310
Like wow.

1187
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,990
Tried to ciphering that.

1188
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,290
Then people will fight
to the death over those,

1189
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,393
those beliefs.

1190
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,630
Lethal call map with theater or Dara to
change the meaning that's I need to cut

1191
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:32,590
off your bolts and board.

1192
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,470
Well,

1193
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,550
I bought the fact that,

1194
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:36,851
you know,

1195
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:39,950
like even the shit that was written
down when they wrote it down in ancient

1196
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:40,700
Hebrew,

1197
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,690
ancient Hebrew is a very bizarre
language and it doesn't have,

1198
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,860
they don't have numbers.

1199
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,680
So letters double as numbers.

1200
00:32:47,681 --> 00:32:50,750
So there's a numerical meaning to words.

1201
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:55,220
There's a different grasp to the words
that we can really barely comprehend.

1202
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,990
And these words [inaudible]
numerical content was very important.

1203
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:00,860
Uh,

1204
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,010
for the actual meaning like
the word God and the word love.

1205
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,130
They have the same numerical
content and there was,

1206
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:07,460
uh,

1207
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,240
you know,

1208
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,250
a translation from that too raw to,

1209
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,540
to Latin and then to Greek.

1210
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,910
And if they're doing that,

1211
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,181
I mean,

1212
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:17,810
Jesus Christ.

1213
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,610
What w what are they?

1214
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,511
Gonna I mean,

1215
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:22,760
how do you even know what the
fuck was the original word?

1216
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,061
Oh yeah,

1217
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:23,650
exactly.

1218
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,530
On the telephone.

1219
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:27,770
After you played for the long and somebody
decided then you'll translate it in a

1220
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:29,480
bunch of languages and that it's like,

1221
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:29,690
no,

1222
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,370
there are so many few
authors to go through it.

1223
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,380
I woulda hell knows what
it was at the beginning.

1224
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,910
And people have to make decisions,

1225
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,430
you know,

1226
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,510
like they have to decide like
what goes in and what goes out.

1227
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,380
You know,

1228
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,410
how to like the King James
version and you know,

1229
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:42,571
the,

1230
00:33:42,571 --> 00:33:45,830
the whole idea behind the new
testament is just so preposterous.

1231
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,900
If you find out how it was created,

1232
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,120
it was Constantine a bunch of bishops,

1233
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:50,900
right?

1234
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,870
I mean constantly was against their
best Calico's it's just about,

1235
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,733
you know,

1236
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,390
where's Nadine enemies and he's the guy
who pushed out or I need those that are

1237
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:00,050
formed that,

1238
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,170
but increased the idea is why.

1239
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,003
And he's like,

1240
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:02,601
I don't know.

1241
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:04,610
That's the guy you want to
have in your car and therefore,

1242
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,031
yeah,

1243
00:34:05,031 --> 00:34:07,100
that's the guy that's creating the Bible.

1244
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,390
You could fucking crazy.

1245
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,530
It's amazing because you know,

1246
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,393
people will say,

1247
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,820
if you bring up the Bible would
bring up crazy stuff that oh,

1248
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:14,960
that's the old testament.

1249
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:18,380
We go by the New Testament that the
new testament was written by a fucking

1250
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:19,060
murderer.

1251
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,870
Even that is bullshit because it's,

1252
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,650
they only say that about the old
testament when the old testament is solved

1253
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,020
Zilliow Virta topknots
that it's embarrassing.

1254
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,460
Then anytime it say something that
they want it and that's not in the New

1255
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:31,461
Testament,

1256
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:31,701
he's like,

1257
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:31,971
hey,

1258
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:32,751
it's in the Bible,

1259
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:33,584
but I'm like,

1260
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:33,770
no,

1261
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:33,951
wait,

1262
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:35,840
that's the book you just told
me that he doesn't count.

1263
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,500
No,

1264
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,490
but when he'd say something,

1265
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:37,880
he law.

1266
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,900
I like Danny counts.

1267
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,560
How do you deal with that as you know,

1268
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:43,170
as,

1269
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:43,780
uh,

1270
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,260
when,

1271
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,560
when you're trying to,

1272
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:46,851
when,

1273
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:47,061
when,

1274
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:49,670
when people are teaching it
and when you're trying to,

1275
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,533
you know,

1276
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,770
studied theology.

1277
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,050
How do you mean?

1278
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:54,950
How does anybody go?

1279
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:55,580
Why?

1280
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,031
I mean it's,

1281
00:34:56,031 --> 00:35:00,830
it's how many people who were actually
studying theology are religious and how

1282
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:03,260
many of them get to a point
where they become agnostic?

1283
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,090
Eh,

1284
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:04,400
it's,

1285
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,660
I guess it depends where they do it.

1286
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:05,811
You know,

1287
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:08,210
if they do it as some
hardcore Christian school,

1288
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:10,790
well that's going to be
one type of clientele.

1289
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,560
If they do it more in public schools.

1290
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,350
When I first started teaching
the history of 30 John's class,

1291
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:15,980
I thought,

1292
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,460
shit,

1293
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,690
why did I get myself into,

1294
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:17,841
you know,

1295
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:21,530
I'm gonna I was all excited until five
minutes before and then I'm like they are

1296
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:22,260
going to kill me.

1297
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,700
You know what I'm going to worry about
that like with like Muslims are like the

1298
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:28,440
most is that the people reaction,

1299
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,920
that stuff arrow that id open minded.

1300
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,380
Otherwise they wouldn't be taking it
because they don't want to eat it.

1301
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:33,651
Right.

1302
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:37,620
So most of the people who do show up
are the ones who have a more minded

1303
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:38,070
approach

1304
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,641
and so on.

1305
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:39,720
So they are cool,

1306
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,613
you know they,

1307
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,301
there are people to order,

1308
00:35:41,301 --> 00:35:43,200
we lean to chat and engage and so on.

1309
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,871
If you,

1310
00:35:43,871 --> 00:35:47,410
if you have a mind and if you can
think and you start studying religion,

1311
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,540
it's almost impossible to not be agnostic.

1312
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,733
I mean

1313
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,080
rarely stickily again nobody knows shit
wanting some kind of absolute answer

1314
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,450
where there is none.

1315
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,340
It's just showed that you are so damn
fearful that you just want to ignore any

1316
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:04,510
evidence in order to decide the,

1317
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,870
I need some serotonin.

1318
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:10,760
It's also very weird characteristic that
people have to need closure and to need

1319
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,610
a side to be on,

1320
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,780
even though there's no answer yet.

1321
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:16,130
We haven't reached that point yet.

1322
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,560
There's,

1323
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,220
there's a door you have to
open that door is death.

1324
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:20,060
When that door opens,

1325
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:21,170
you'll get some more information.

1326
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:21,801
But who knows?

1327
00:36:21,801 --> 00:36:22,341
You might not be,

1328
00:36:22,341 --> 00:36:23,020
maybe not,

1329
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,850
it might just be a baby in
1950 [inaudible] you know,

1330
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,350
to say it is like,

1331
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,243
you know what I'm saying?

1332
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,410
Yeah,

1333
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:29,770
yeah,

1334
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,150
yeah.

1335
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,620
No,

1336
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:30,801
look,

1337
00:36:30,801 --> 00:36:34,700
it's bizarre enough that you're a person
bizarre enough to use your eyeballs to

1338
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:35,600
judge distance.

1339
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:39,290
You have these fucking organs inside
your skull that measure light,

1340
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:42,530
right and distance and
they figure out exactly,

1341
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:46,820
precisely how far away you are from things
and that allows you to get into metal

1342
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:48,320
boxes with rubber wheels.

1343
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:52,550
And that's just as bizarre as coming
back as a baby in the fifties you know,

1344
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:54,050
everything we do is bizarre.

1345
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,310
No,

1346
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,640
you've had the university's amazing.

1347
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:55,821
I mean,

1348
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:56,820
it's so weird

1349
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:00,440
that it's beyond anything I can understand
and precisely because I respect it

1350
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:01,400
and I may know of it.

1351
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,280
Trying to make it all feet
in my little box of bow.

1352
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:07,220
Every sing is supposed
to work is bullshit.

1353
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,080
The best quote ever heard of
it from JBS Haldane who said,

1354
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:14,790
not only is the universe queer than you
suppose it's queer than you can suppose

1355
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,980
I can sign up for that.

1356
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:17,380
Yeah.

1357
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,121
Get it right.

1358
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:18,480
Yep.

1359
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,310
That's it.

1360
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,820
So fucking what is,

1361
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,790
what the fuck is that ridiculous.

1362
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,270
So when you got involved in religion,

1363
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:29,070
did you originally get involved with it?

1364
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:31,410
Because from an archeological standpoint,

1365
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:31,950
no,

1366
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,783
it was a,

1367
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:33,790
it was like God,

1368
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:36,020
I got the involved with just
about every saint gods completely.

1369
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:36,561
By chance.

1370
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:36,801
I mean,

1371
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:37,471
I wasn't willing to wait.

1372
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:38,960
That would that add to for myself,

1373
00:37:38,961 --> 00:37:41,870
I would read mainly a lot of eastern
philosophy and stuff like that that I was

1374
00:37:41,871 --> 00:37:42,170
into.

1375
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,700
But I would read for the hell of it.

1376
00:37:43,701 --> 00:37:44,870
And the,

1377
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:45,470
um,

1378
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,221
somebody down,

1379
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:46,911
when they ask me,

1380
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:47,271
hey man,

1381
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:48,800
we need somebody to teach this thing,

1382
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,521
can you do it?

1383
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:50,150
I'm like,

1384
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,480
no,

1385
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:50,931
not really.

1386
00:37:50,931 --> 00:37:51,470
And they were like,

1387
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:51,770
no,

1388
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,071
come on,

1389
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:52,830
you're kind of thing around.

1390
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,421
I said this man,

1391
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:53,641
you know,

1392
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:54,800
a lot of chefs do it.

1393
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:55,490
I'm like,

1394
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,030
okay,

1395
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,510
sure.

1396
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,590
And I jump on and I'm like,

1397
00:37:57,591 --> 00:37:57,711
yeah,

1398
00:37:57,711 --> 00:37:58,340
I love this stuff.

1399
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,910
This is fun.

1400
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,580
I got to talk about all the
stuff I like and this is awesome.

1401
00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:04,670
And so then I started
reading more and more and uh,

1402
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,780
but I mean,

1403
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:05,961
yeah,

1404
00:38:05,961 --> 00:38:06,171
I mean,

1405
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:07,790
I read my stuff before it will begin.

1406
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,021
Wait,

1407
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:09,980
they didn't know in their
moment of pure perversion,

1408
00:38:09,981 --> 00:38:14,981
I decided to read the entire Bible cover
to cover when I was 18 the most painful

1409
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:16,610
experiences of my life.

1410
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,830
But that's what got me up though.

1411
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:20,030
When I got to this part,

1412
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:20,350
uh,

1413
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,500
the song of Solomon,

1414
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,370
there's,

1415
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,870
be able to have that book ended
up in the Bible is awesome.

1416
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:26,150
It's like one of the best things,

1417
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,411
all of a sad.

1418
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:28,700
Then you have 10,

1419
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:29,151
15,

1420
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:31,820
I forgot how many pages where
they don't mention God ones,

1421
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:32,890
they don't mention police,

1422
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,430
they don't mention anything.

1423
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:34,910
It jazz,

1424
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,640
the super passionate,

1425
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:39,280
erotic love poem between
a man and a woman.

1426
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:42,730
A woman we enjoy sex as well
is also from our point of view,

1427
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:44,890
which is completely unheard
of in the rest of the Bible.

1428
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,770
And he's just the celebration
of sacs essentially.

1429
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:48,604
And they just like,

1430
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,680
I always like how the hell it is.

1431
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:51,730
And that been very or no.

1432
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:55,450
And my theory is that one of the guys
who are copying all the scriptures got

1433
00:38:55,451 --> 00:38:59,230
drunk one night and took the wrong scroll
and got this homemade power and area

1434
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,523
by mistake.

1435
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,020
It's awesome.

1436
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,321
You know,

1437
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:03,010
it's uh,

1438
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:03,820
sum is it,

1439
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,790
do you know of a John
Marco OLED gross work?

1440
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,620
I heard of him.

1441
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,160
Um,

1442
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,150
I heard of him a bunch,

1443
00:39:09,151 --> 00:39:11,370
but I haven't read him actually directly.

1444
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,590
He's the guy that was one of the,

1445
00:39:13,591 --> 00:39:14,340
um,

1446
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,630
the people that was working on the Dead
Sea Scrolls who's working on deciphering

1447
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:19,110
it.

1448
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,771
And uh,

1449
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:21,870
he was the only agnostic of the group.

1450
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,640
And he wrote a book called,

1451
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,840
we wrote a couple of them.

1452
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:28,110
One of them was called the Dead
Sea Scrolls and the Christian myth.

1453
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,200
And the first one was called the
sacred mushroom and the cross.

1454
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,560
And that one's fascinating book.

1455
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,191
It's a,

1456
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:40,191
he believes that the entire works of
the Christian religion were originally,

1457
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,280
um,

1458
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,150
mushroom.

1459
00:39:42,151 --> 00:39:44,580
It was about mushroom eating and,

1460
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,390
um,

1461
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:48,120
psychedelic drugs and,

1462
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,013
um,

1463
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,260
ritual sex and about a fertility rituals
and making sure that they kept breeding

1464
00:39:54,901 --> 00:39:55,141
and that,

1465
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:55,381
you know,

1466
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:56,570
women kept having babies,

1467
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,810
shit that was seeing swale wrong.

1468
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:58,900
Isn't that amazing?

1469
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,220
That's,

1470
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,800
and he said his,

1471
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:05,990
he tracks down the word mushroom
or the word Jesus rather to a,

1472
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:06,391
a,

1473
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:08,250
an ancient Sumerian word.

1474
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,450
The roots of it being an ancient Sumerian
word that means a mushroom covered in

1475
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,590
God's semen.

1476
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,920
And that the idea he believes,

1477
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:17,460
and this is,

1478
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,960
I mean he's making a big reach that I
don't think unless you have some sort of

1479
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,420
serious education and language history,

1480
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:26,310
you could totally even grasp the argument.

1481
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,510
But what he's saying is that what
they used to call a mushrooms,

1482
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:31,340
they,

1483
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:31,680
it was,

1484
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,640
it was like a,

1485
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:37,320
God would come on the earth when it would
rain and then mushrooms would grow out

1486
00:40:37,321 --> 00:40:37,621
of that.

1487
00:40:37,621 --> 00:40:38,330
They would eat them,

1488
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:41,280
they'd have these incredible
psychedelic experiences because of that.

1489
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,870
And so that was Christ.

1490
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,870
So Christ was a mushroom that
was covered in God seaman.

1491
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,261
Well,

1492
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:46,471
I mean,

1493
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:47,100
you have stopped.

1494
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,551
You ever ready?

1495
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:48,300
Just thrown in the water?

1496
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,270
Where's anything from [inaudible] to high?

1497
00:40:50,271 --> 00:40:52,500
You ask our to a lot of
psychedelic substances.

1498
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:53,420
I'm Anita Muskata,

1499
00:40:53,421 --> 00:40:54,690
the mushroom itself,

1500
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,920
a bunch of scenes that have been central
to people's religion because they open

1501
00:40:58,921 --> 00:41:00,330
up all these words and so on.

1502
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:00,621
So,

1503
00:41:00,621 --> 00:41:01,040
so

1504
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,750
probably the early origins of a lot of
the stores and a lot of the experiences

1505
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:05,820
and no wonder you start seeing,

1506
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:06,311
and we are dubbed,

1507
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:07,144
God's flying around,

1508
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,110
especially back when it
was hard to get food.

1509
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:09,420
Oh yeah.

1510
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,740
And it was difficult when people were
hunter gatherers essentially before

1511
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:14,090
religion was written down,

1512
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,510
people were,

1513
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:14,801
I mean,

1514
00:41:14,801 --> 00:41:18,080
when they were supposed to be a
hunter gathers up until like what,

1515
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:19,010
10,000 years ago,

1516
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:19,930
10,000 years,

1517
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:20,720
something like that.

1518
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,950
Although that's coming into dispute,

1519
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:22,131
you know,

1520
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:26,720
they found a fucking fishing hooks and
fishing line and tuna bones tuna from

1521
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:30,020
40,000 years ago and they don't know.

1522
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,620
They don't,

1523
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,020
they've never thought that people
were capable of doing this.

1524
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,440
Now they're thinking that up to 40,000
years ago people were getting in boats

1525
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,850
and they were going hundreds of miles
into the ocean and they were catching

1526
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:41,271
tuna.

1527
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:46,271
Dude tune up 40,000 years ago they were
in boats catching tuna like they have no

1528
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:50,810
idea that that people were doing that.

1529
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,291
This was,

1530
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:53,750
this is a complete like a new revelation.

1531
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,000
It's like going to rewrite
history because they,

1532
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:01,030
I mean what kind of fishing line do you
have that you're making 42,000 years ago

1533
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:06,950
that you can pull a fucking thousand pound
tuna out of hundreds of feet of water

1534
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,660
and you've got to hook in some meat.

1535
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,000
What is going on man?

1536
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,590
How was that possible?

1537
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,580
We might have to like re wire
the or rewrite the whole.

1538
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,120
I've been,

1539
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,190
I have a a very strong feeling that over
the next few years there's going to be

1540
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:26,390
more and more evidence like this that
makes people want to push back the origins

1541
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:26,541
of,

1542
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:28,000
you heard it go back to the Tempe.

1543
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,460
This,

1544
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,660
this new structure that they found in
Turkey is another one where they're,

1545
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,941
they're,

1546
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:34,310
they're thinking they're going
to have to push back the,

1547
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:34,521
uh,

1548
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:38,450
the origins of civilization because
it's at least 12,000 years old and it's

1549
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:43,451
these huge like sculpted stone columns
and they have all these animals that are

1550
00:42:43,581 --> 00:42:45,920
drawn on it that don't
even exist where you know,

1551
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:46,131
in,

1552
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:46,964
in Turkey.

1553
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,390
So these animals like weren't
even supposed to be in the
fossil record from that

1554
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,230
back then.

1555
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,580
So what the belief is there,

1556
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:53,741
the,

1557
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:54,590
the current there,

1558
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,410
where they're trying to say now is that
this was made by hunter and gatherers

1559
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:58,390
and a lot of people going,

1560
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,390
come on man.

1561
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,770
Like what the fuck is this?

1562
00:43:00,771 --> 00:43:01,604
This is giant.

1563
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,450
Did just the fact that someone
made something like this
13,000 years ago when we

1564
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:07,250
never thought people were
making stuff like this.

1565
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,080
You might have to go,

1566
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:09,621
wait a minute,

1567
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:11,450
how much of this is really a leftover?

1568
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,400
Is there a bunch of stuff
we haven't found yet?

1569
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:16,580
And if there is and we do
find it eventually there's
going to be a point in time

1570
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:17,414
where they're going to have to say,

1571
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,340
I think we've been around
longer than we think.

1572
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,280
Not thought that and goes back
to the we don't know shit.

1573
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,461
Right.

1574
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:22,850
Yeah.

1575
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,700
That's why we are rewriting history all
the time because I mean that's why you

1576
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:28,760
know you read the history books and you
have like the last 50 years sees the

1577
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,640
steak and then the first
20,000 years he's like,

1578
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:32,570
okay,

1579
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:36,320
we already here for a while and then 50
or so ago these App Ben and he's like,

1580
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:37,154
okay,

1581
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,053
we don't know much.

1582
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,050
We also,

1583
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,570
we look so much different
than anything else here.

1584
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,740
You know we are,

1585
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:43,940
we are some kind of an ape,

1586
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,021
but God damn,

1587
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:46,450
we looked different than
the rest of the apes.

1588
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,840
How long did this take?

1589
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,940
How long did it take for
us to look like this?

1590
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:50,241
You know,

1591
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:50,691
for east.

1592
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:51,520
Sure.

1593
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,370
Are you sure it's been a million years
is maybe he's been to and if it's been

1594
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:55,611
too,

1595
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:56,900
that changes a lot of shit.

1596
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:57,861
You know,

1597
00:43:57,861 --> 00:43:58,820
we don't really know.

1598
00:43:58,821 --> 00:43:59,330
This is,

1599
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,370
this is a lot of guessing going on man.

1600
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,211
And how many,

1601
00:44:02,211 --> 00:44:02,710
I mean did,

1602
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:03,080
did,

1603
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,540
was it a clean separation
between us and the apes?

1604
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,873
No.

1605
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:09,040
Or maybe that hates to little cough,

1606
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,240
but if there's something
that was super advanced,

1607
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:12,500
more advanced than us,

1608
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,150
we just haven't met it yet.

1609
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:14,540
Right.

1610
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,890
And it's here just hiding from us.

1611
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:16,101
Like,

1612
00:44:16,101 --> 00:44:16,341
oh,

1613
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:17,960
those crazy monkeys there.

1614
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:18,501
It's just,

1615
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:18,771
you know,

1616
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:20,900
it's another couple
thousand years ahead of us.

1617
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,340
Maybe that's what the aliens are

1618
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,741
probably not.

1619
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:25,574
Right.

1620
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:26,901
So,

1621
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:27,590
um,

1622
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:30,860
this Marco Allegro guy
met a lot of controversy.

1623
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:31,980
When was trying

1624
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,360
to propose that religion might,

1625
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:36,690
might've had its roots in
psychedelic experiences.

1626
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:42,030
Why do you think people are so
reluctant to take in that possibility?

1627
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,043
Cause anything,

1628
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,450
any kind of psychedelic
experience is very individual.

1629
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:45,751
You know,

1630
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:49,560
it's hard to build that church on it in
a sense that it's hard to have a dogma

1631
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,470
because it changes so much from
one experience to the next,

1632
00:44:52,471 --> 00:44:53,880
from one person to the next.

1633
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,310
And people bottom line loft dogma,

1634
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:56,941
that's the thing.

1635
00:44:56,941 --> 00:45:00,600
Direct short them direct experience
doesn't reassure them because they have to

1636
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:03,390
base it on their own feelings of
their own in state on their own.

1637
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:04,710
And it's too scary for people.

1638
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:05,130
And now you,

1639
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,030
we are you.

1640
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:06,551
We are people.

1641
00:45:06,551 --> 00:45:08,550
It took so much shit
about why we like freedom.

1642
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,080
Most people are terrified,

1643
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:10,681
afraid of math.

1644
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:11,550
People hate freedom.

1645
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:15,930
You know they liked the idea of being
free but they ran to their chains anytime

1646
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:18,600
they can because they need
something to keep them safe,

1647
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:20,540
to make them feel like hey are okay,

1648
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,960
we are going to be fine.

1649
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,793
You know?

1650
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,400
So I mean any direct experience,

1651
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,290
I mean think about martial arts,

1652
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,970
how long it took for people.

1653
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,750
Super attached to these
is how we do things.

1654
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:35,220
This is the throat of combat.

1655
00:45:35,221 --> 00:45:37,020
When in martial arts you can try it.

1656
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:37,291
You know,

1657
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:40,020
he's not like a religion where
there's not as much direct evidence.

1658
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:40,201
You know,

1659
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:43,380
you can try it and still people would
stick their head in the sand and no one

1660
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:43,860
has seats.

1661
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,570
That's some shit just didn't work.

1662
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:49,050
And it was fascinating that it's
one of the most fundamental forms of

1663
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:49,884
competition.

1664
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,380
And yet we're way better at it now.

1665
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,800
And we have evolved it now
over the last 20 years,

1666
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:57,540
more than at any time in human history,

1667
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,020
episode two.

1668
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,200
So you got to think people should
have known a long time ago,

1669
00:46:01,201 --> 00:46:02,070
but not really.

1670
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:02,370
Right?

1671
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,530
Because fighting is difficult and it's,

1672
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,420
it's dangerous and it's scary.

1673
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,680
And most people try to avoid
it if and whenever possible.

1674
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,890
So there's not a lot of testing it out.

1675
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,130
Right.

1676
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,010
And it wasn't until something like the
ultimate fighting championship came along

1677
00:46:14,011 --> 00:46:15,810
and we really found out
what actually works.

1678
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,670
Now we know what fighting is.

1679
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,990
Now we really know what fighting is.

1680
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,400
That's amazing when you think about it,

1681
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:22,410
just as an archeological thing,

1682
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:22,891
you know,

1683
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:25,770
the fact that over the last
20 years they figured it out.

1684
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:26,011
Yeah.

1685
00:46:26,011 --> 00:46:26,170
No,

1686
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:26,940
it's amazing.

1687
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,810
It's amazing.

1688
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,970
Even though the other day I thought
that I agree with what you said,

1689
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:31,680
but I just saw the scene
that cracked me up.

1690
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:34,920
I saw this Roman sculpture
a few days ago for,

1691
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,150
I mean a picture where DERs,

1692
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:36,571
these,

1693
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:36,960
uh,

1694
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,010
the naked guys wrestling.

1695
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,221
No,

1696
00:46:38,221 --> 00:46:38,611
not even.

1697
00:46:38,611 --> 00:46:39,990
There's like these half man,

1698
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:40,830
half horse.

1699
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,090
Howard was called an English sense and
Tara was putting some dude in a heel

1700
00:46:45,091 --> 00:46:45,450
hook.

1701
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:48,750
What's a minute tar and went to
Sentara is the one with the bull.

1702
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:51,110
The center is the reform
force and that's my favorite.

1703
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,700
The center hasn't there is and that guy
is put in the heel hook onto somebody.

1704
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,640
Oh really?

1705
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,260
He'll hook by a cent or 2000 years ago.

1706
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,820
That's how they knew a lot of
submissions that back then.

1707
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,120
I bet they had a couple of
them are sub 30 cool sakes.

1708
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:05,461
But no,

1709
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:06,001
I agree with you.

1710
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:09,300
I mean the evolution over the last 20
years is unparalleled the way tiny singles

1711
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:09,751
before.

1712
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:13,380
That's why my dream would be to be able
to have the UFC offered allegiance where

1713
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,060
that I learned at these people going
off about these lamb is awesome.

1714
00:47:17,061 --> 00:47:17,201
No,

1715
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,080
you're a soccer boot.

1716
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:20,880
These of is going to to like
just shut up and get in a cage.

1717
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,320
I sit back have a BRC.

1718
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:26,070
What that said that we
could stop whining forever,

1719
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:27,750
accepts it losses though.

1720
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,980
Not Bad.

1721
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,040
They always think

1722
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,230
the guy got lucky and they
want to come back and you know,

1723
00:47:32,231 --> 00:47:33,640
Islam is going to make a comeback bitch.

1724
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,300
But wouldn't that be fun?

1725
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:36,971
That'd be awesome.

1726
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:37,061
Well,

1727
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:40,630
it's very strange to me when
guys switched religions like,

1728
00:47:40,631 --> 00:47:40,781
you know,

1729
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:42,580
like a dude will convert and become,

1730
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:42,970
you know,

1731
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,140
a Jew or you know,

1732
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:48,400
convert and become something else or a
Christian or Catholic base it on walk

1733
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,473
more evidence.

1734
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,100
They found a better group of
people to hang out with think,

1735
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:52,810
you know,

1736
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:53,561
it's what it is.

1737
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:55,450
It's like when you change nationalities.

1738
00:47:55,451 --> 00:47:55,870
Yeah.

1739
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:56,410
You know,

1740
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:57,010
it's uh,

1741
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:57,350
it's,

1742
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:58,810
it's a very controversial thing,

1743
00:47:58,811 --> 00:47:59,021
you know,

1744
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:01,390
when you become a US citizen or you know,

1745
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,600
when did you become a Unisis?

1746
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,020
Yeah,

1747
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:03,490
yeah.

1748
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,840
Was that a weird thing for you?

1749
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:05,561
I mean,

1750
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:05,981
for one,

1751
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:08,140
it didn't have to give
up Italian citizenship,

1752
00:48:08,141 --> 00:48:09,370
so it really doesn't change much.

1753
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:10,201
I can still travel.

1754
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:13,300
I can see that was bad ass
dual citizenships cool.

1755
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:14,900
The way I didn't have these,

1756
00:48:14,901 --> 00:48:15,351
we are like,

1757
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:15,741
Oh shit,

1758
00:48:15,741 --> 00:48:16,221
I'm Kathy,

1759
00:48:16,221 --> 00:48:18,830
my cat in the bridges with the best.

1760
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,360
That's so I didn't have to do with that.

1761
00:48:20,361 --> 00:48:21,200
So it wasn't a weird,

1762
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:21,581
you know,

1763
00:48:21,581 --> 00:48:25,070
it's just like ass stupid piece of paper
that I can go in line faster next time.

1764
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:28,350
I've got a friend of mine who's got
that Canadian American dual citizenship

1765
00:48:28,351 --> 00:48:29,184
thing.

1766
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,210
That's dope.

1767
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:32,490
He goes back and forth with no problems.

1768
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,380
You can work over there
and work over here.

1769
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,220
It's a cool,

1770
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:35,760
beautiful.

1771
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,120
Yup,

1772
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:36,390
Yup,

1773
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:36,870
Yup.

1774
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:37,860
Lots of very good gig.

1775
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:39,750
But when you signed up to the evil empire,

1776
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,700
when you signed up the final documents,

1777
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:42,060
we were like,

1778
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,380
oh my goodness,

1779
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,120
look what I've just joined up with.

1780
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:49,180
I just joined up with the baddest gang
and human history and that's really what

1781
00:48:49,181 --> 00:48:50,014
he joined.

1782
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,210
He joined the United States.

1783
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,720
I always say that the people in the United
States that we are living inside the

1784
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:55,710
balls of the Dick.

1785
00:48:55,711 --> 00:48:56,670
That's fucking the world.

1786
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:59,430
I like Gary mentioned mentoring play it,

1787
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,660
but we don't,

1788
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,680
we're not a part of it,

1789
00:49:01,681 --> 00:49:02,071
but we,

1790
00:49:02,071 --> 00:49:07,071
we essentially take residents inside the
balls of the Great Dick that's fucking

1791
00:49:07,141 --> 00:49:11,730
the world hundred different military
bases in a hundred different countries or

1792
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:13,020
whatever the fuck we've got now.

1793
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,010
I love to write that down.

1794
00:49:14,011 --> 00:49:14,700
That's awesome.

1795
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,630
That's what it is.

1796
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,071
You know,

1797
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:18,420
you just joined the best Bot.

1798
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:19,350
This is the best bot.

1799
00:49:19,351 --> 00:49:19,951
It's safe here.

1800
00:49:19,951 --> 00:49:20,251
Mad.

1801
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:21,330
We're just throwing a lot of punches.

1802
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,460
Everybody's back in the fuck up.

1803
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,390
We've got this thing circled
everywhere else is quite dangerous.

1804
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:29,641
So,

1805
00:49:29,641 --> 00:49:30,110
um,

1806
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:30,311
you,

1807
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:30,540
you,

1808
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,660
you got into this religion,

1809
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,990
you started teaching
and you wrote this book.

1810
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:34,860
Now in,

1811
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,910
in writing this book,

1812
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:36,960
was there anything that you,

1813
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:36,960
you

1814
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,780
found that you found the shocked,

1815
00:49:38,781 --> 00:49:40,820
even you with all the shit
that you know about religion?

1816
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:41,121
No.

1817
00:49:41,121 --> 00:49:43,100
I mean I've seen enough
stuff that I buy now.

1818
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:45,980
It's kind of hard about bringing the
arguments with fundamentalist people.

1819
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:46,341
No,

1820
00:49:46,341 --> 00:49:48,440
because I think one of the
scene I tell them is that,

1821
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:48,890
amen.

1822
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:53,720
I'm not telling you anything about any
single one religion because we teen any

1823
00:49:53,721 --> 00:49:54,141
religion,

1824
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:57,710
there's so much variation that DDS
agree on just about every sing among

1825
00:49:57,711 --> 00:49:59,140
Christians among Muslims.

1826
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,480
I'm like,

1827
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,480
I'm just making a general point about
where assert dine belief has led to do it.

1828
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,170
You want to identify with that.

1829
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:06,770
Good for you.

1830
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:07,250
You don't,

1831
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,830
but I'm not saying you're
already John Equal this.

1832
00:50:09,831 --> 00:50:12,370
I'm saying that as busy as
the contents of your religion,

1833
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,100
but my low out of cause
they don't take it.

1834
00:50:14,101 --> 00:50:14,841
That's personnel.

1835
00:50:14,841 --> 00:50:18,020
And then I tried to make it kind of
fun and just play and laugh about it.

1836
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:19,070
So having a sense of humor,

1837
00:50:19,071 --> 00:50:20,530
usually metal of the mouth Alito,

1838
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,520
so it doesn't get too,

1839
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:25,730
I've even had some hardcore
weird fundamentals that I sold.

1840
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,010
They were out to kill me that
suddenly loved me by the end

1841
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:28,843
of class and I'm like,

1842
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:29,780
really?

1843
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,890
Have you been listening to I?

1844
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,450
That's where I think the
Italian accent coming in.

1845
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:34,110
I don't think they
understood a thing guy said,

1846
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:35,780
but it sounded cool.

1847
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:40,100
And so they were smooth talker and
you obviously are well educated.

1848
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:43,670
So the words come out nice and dry and
you know you're basically talking about

1849
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:45,870
the Bible and their little brains lock up.

1850
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,600
That is a problem too,

1851
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:48,411
isn't it a problem?

1852
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:49,520
There's some people are just dumb.

1853
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,060
Yup.

1854
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:54,140
I mean I'm afraid that's the majority
of people and I don't think it's,

1855
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,160
I think a lot of people don't want to
believe that it's a biological issue.

1856
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,970
A lot of people want to believe that it's
an education issue or an environmental

1857
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:03,350
issue or cultural issue.

1858
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:04,550
And they may be,

1859
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,320
but it also might be,

1860
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,030
it might be biological,

1861
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,511
it might be,

1862
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:08,930
look,

1863
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:11,330
there's people that are born
and they're seven feet tall,

1864
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:11,810
you know,

1865
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:12,621
there's people that are born,

1866
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:14,030
they have giant Dicks,

1867
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,880
there's the,

1868
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,141
you know,

1869
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:17,250
there's a great variation of human beings.

1870
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:20,510
And when I just see this
just giant wave of sloth,

1871
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,111
you know,

1872
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:24,380
you see like a giant percentage
of people in this country,

1873
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,630
I don't know if it's 20% want
to know what the number is.

1874
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:27,591
We just look at them.

1875
00:51:27,591 --> 00:51:27,830
You're like,

1876
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:28,730
my God.

1877
00:51:28,731 --> 00:51:30,200
You're like barely thinking.

1878
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:32,030
You're barely a person.

1879
00:51:32,031 --> 00:51:35,410
Like are you just lazy or do you have
like a nine volt battery kicking inside

1880
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:36,263
your fucking head?

1881
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:36,980
You know,

1882
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,540
they might have a nine volt battery,

1883
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:43,541
they might have shit jeans and a poor
like database to draw from genetically.

1884
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,163
No one in their,

1885
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:45,950
you know,

1886
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:46,251
their,

1887
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:47,150
their genes,

1888
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:50,960
their ancestries had been any different
than them and they've gotten this far,

1889
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:52,130
so there's no need to adapt.

1890
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:52,670
No.

1891
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:52,911
Yeah.

1892
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:53,571
So it's like,

1893
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:53,871
you know,

1894
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:58,180
you come across a wild pig or you come
across a pig that's in a pen and they're,

1895
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,480
they're completely different animals.

1896
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,650
Maybe that was what's going on and
then it that case we're fucked.

1897
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:04,170
Yeah,

1898
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:04,970
exactly.

1899
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:08,780
Maybe that's why wars keep going on and
maybe that's why religion keeps working.

1900
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:09,710
Yeah.

1901
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:10,340
Maybe it's like,

1902
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,900
it's almost impossible.

1903
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:14,720
Have you ever seen the movie idiocracy no,

1904
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:15,341
I haven't seen it.

1905
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:15,741
What I heard,

1906
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:16,131
it's funny,

1907
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:17,780
I just wanted to see that movie by now.

1908
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:19,640
I know I got upset because,

1909
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:20,230
um,

1910
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:25,230
a couple of people accused me of stealing
the idea for that bit that I had for

1911
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:25,971
my special,

1912
00:52:25,971 --> 00:52:28,400
the bit about the dumb people
outbreeding smart people.

1913
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:28,880
Right.

1914
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,391
First of all,

1915
00:52:29,391 --> 00:52:30,620
that's not a,

1916
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:31,790
an original concepts.

1917
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,230
I've been thinking that forever.

1918
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:33,561
Of course.

1919
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:34,281
And second of all,

1920
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:38,420
my special came out before that movie
came out and it was something I worked on

1921
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,980
for years before the special.

1922
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:40,880
It's just a,

1923
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,240
you know,

1924
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,410
everybody's had that thought.

1925
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:44,400
So because of that I bought
it and I never watched it.

1926
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,210
I didn't want to see how
close it is to my shit.

1927
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,113
You are paced.

1928
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,400
You know,

1929
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,570
you get in these,

1930
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:50,930
um,

1931
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,700
these defending yourself,

1932
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,600
there's no need to defend yourself
and say it's gross when you,

1933
00:52:55,650 --> 00:53:00,650
that's one of the things
about communicating with
people online is the anonymity

1934
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:02,420
and the deal.

1935
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:02,990
Sometimes you're,

1936
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,890
you're dealing with people,

1937
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:05,030
you're just dealing with like,

1938
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:06,440
why are you behaving this way?

1939
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:07,820
Like why are you communicating this way?

1940
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:09,290
This is the only way you do.

1941
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,950
The only reason why people
would communicate that way
is because there's a lack

1942
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,570
of social repercussions.

1943
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,190
Here's no can say anything and get away.

1944
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:17,930
You don't feel it.

1945
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:18,710
You don't feel it.

1946
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:19,101
You know,

1947
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:22,610
it's like the reason why people in their
car can give you the fuck you fucking,

1948
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:23,660
when they wouldn't do that,

1949
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,230
if they were just on the
street a few feet from,

1950
00:53:25,231 --> 00:53:25,670
you know,

1951
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,810
that fantasy in a car right next to you.

1952
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:28,320
They just,

1953
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,590
because there's a window and because
there's a door and a window and a door and

1954
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,090
some space in between that they're like,

1955
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:33,661
fuck you,

1956
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:34,494
you fucking bitch.

1957
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:35,361
You wouldn't do it.

1958
00:53:35,361 --> 00:53:38,820
Why you would do then the person you
will to be a crazy person to do that in

1959
00:53:38,821 --> 00:53:39,654
person.

1960
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,390
But there's a detachment
because of the automobiles.

1961
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:43,410
We can't feel each other.

1962
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,793
See each other.

1963
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,940
We see we're separated by some
shit and we know that it's safe.

1964
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,700
It's the same feeling that you feel
when you're at the zoo and you know,

1965
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:53,080
you don't feel uncomfortable when
you're standing next to a fucking bear.

1966
00:53:53,081 --> 00:53:55,190
He's supposed to be shitting your
pants when you're looking at the bear.

1967
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:55,950
Man,

1968
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:59,430
that is not normal to get
comfortable looking at a bear.

1969
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,440
You should be terrified man.

1970
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:03,090
That fucking thing is
only a few feet from you.

1971
00:54:03,091 --> 00:54:04,110
Trust that glass.

1972
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,400
Let's get outta here.

1973
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:06,540
Yeah,

1974
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,060
man.

1975
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:07,680
It's uh,

1976
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,660
the repercussions of dealing
with people answered that.

1977
00:54:09,661 --> 00:54:10,494
It's very annoying.

1978
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:10,981
Do you,

1979
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:11,280
uh,

1980
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,360
do you post stuff on the Internet?

1981
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,620
You have blogs or anything like that?

1982
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:14,980
I mean,

1983
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,180
my life has been so damn crazy lately
that I've just constantly teaching and

1984
00:54:19,181 --> 00:54:19,870
writing,

1985
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:20,860
teaching a badge.

1986
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,131
I mean,

1987
00:54:21,131 --> 00:54:23,500
I love a lot of bad shit
happened because my um,

1988
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:25,150
my wife died a few months ago.

1989
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:25,770
Charlie.

1990
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:26,603
Good man.

1991
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:27,910
We are all the baby.

1992
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:28,571
So you know,

1993
00:54:28,571 --> 00:54:32,170
you can imagine that alone takes a
hell of a lot of time and energy and

1994
00:54:32,171 --> 00:54:32,710
everything.

1995
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:33,191
And then,

1996
00:54:33,191 --> 00:54:33,761
you know,

1997
00:54:33,761 --> 00:54:35,740
steel working in teaching,

1998
00:54:35,741 --> 00:54:36,490
writing,

1999
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:36,740
doing.

2000
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,780
So I'm just like,

2001
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,913
you know,

2002
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:41,351
keep up on,

2003
00:54:41,351 --> 00:54:41,590
you know,

2004
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:42,041
email,

2005
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:43,300
Facebook kind of stuff.

2006
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:47,560
But I've been trying to save whatever
energy level after cause there's not a

2007
00:54:47,561 --> 00:54:47,940
whole lot of,

2008
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:48,790
by the end of the day,

2009
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:49,331
you know,

2010
00:54:49,331 --> 00:54:51,100
you're doing 7 million things at once.

2011
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,610
So yeah.

2012
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,270
Do you take a lot of vitamins and
eat healthy and the to work on back,

2013
00:54:55,271 --> 00:54:58,330
cause I feel it in my body and all last
few months it's just too much stress,

2014
00:54:58,331 --> 00:54:59,380
too much over the scene.

2015
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:00,050
So I'm just throwing,

2016
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,000
I'd been used to,

2017
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:01,181
you know,

2018
00:55:01,181 --> 00:55:05,290
I worked out forever for 20 years now
this last year I've hardly been able to.

2019
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:06,071
And so of course,

2020
00:55:06,071 --> 00:55:06,341
you know,

2021
00:55:06,341 --> 00:55:08,690
all of this stuff then takes a toll.

2022
00:55:08,691 --> 00:55:09,790
So I'm trying to,

2023
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,360
you know,

2024
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,230
not become a,

2025
00:55:11,231 --> 00:55:11,471
you know,

2026
00:55:11,471 --> 00:55:12,820
the Unabomber or something.

2027
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:16,960
Got The for them evidencing that nobody
body but at the same time save some

2028
00:55:16,961 --> 00:55:18,630
energy for just beneath in,

2029
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,050
Ya know?

2030
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:19,590
Yeah.

2031
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:20,371
That's important,

2032
00:55:20,371 --> 00:55:20,671
man.

2033
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:21,151
It's important.

2034
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:21,984
It's very hard.

2035
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:25,350
Especially people with children with
people don't understand when they have a

2036
00:55:25,351 --> 00:55:26,110
baby.

2037
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,180
A is you,

2038
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,720
you now have a human being taken care of.

2039
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:31,980
It's not like a pet,

2040
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,830
not like you have to be
with it 24 hours a day.

2041
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,510
If it's little and you
have to take a shit,

2042
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,321
you know what you have to do.

2043
00:55:37,321 --> 00:55:40,380
You have to lock it in the room with you
while you're taking a shit or you have

2044
00:55:40,381 --> 00:55:43,560
to like keep it from pulling the things
out of the drawers and the killing

2045
00:55:43,561 --> 00:55:44,394
itself,

2046
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,620
climbing up on something
that they can't support.

2047
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:46,990
You know?

2048
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:47,641
It's like,

2049
00:55:47,641 --> 00:55:48,474
it's a constant,

2050
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,250
like it's a lot of work.

2051
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:50,510
Yeah.

2052
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:52,370
So that anybody has kids.

2053
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:52,681
I'm like,

2054
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:54,780
how the hell does anybody
do this know though is,

2055
00:55:54,781 --> 00:55:55,351
and I love her.

2056
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,580
I mean she's not even a hard baby,

2057
00:55:56,581 --> 00:55:56,810
you know?

2058
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,070
She's an easy sweet bay steel.

2059
00:55:59,130 --> 00:55:59,830
She's amazing.

2060
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:00,663
Nice.

2061
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:01,700
Yeah.

2062
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:01,961
It's,

2063
00:56:01,961 --> 00:56:04,080
it takes a lot of energy
and what you get out of it,

2064
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:05,340
their little drug dispensers,

2065
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,451
which you get out of it,

2066
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:10,560
is love and the purest form possible
cut straight from the source.

2067
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,480
The love that you get from babies,

2068
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:12,840
man.

2069
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,621
Oh my God.

2070
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:13,920
You don't,

2071
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,461
people don't,

2072
00:56:14,461 --> 00:56:18,900
who don't have kids really will never
truly understand this experience because

2073
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,690
you can think you love
a dog because you do.

2074
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:25,690
I love our dogs that see they're sweet
and they give me kisses and I'm happy,

2075
00:56:25,691 --> 00:56:26,530
but you don't.

2076
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,700
There's a feeling that you get when it's
a baby that's your own flesh and blood,

2077
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,180
and they're just little bundles of
love and they're a little bundles of

2078
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:34,870
happiness,

2079
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:36,910
and you can directly influence them.

2080
00:56:36,911 --> 00:56:37,900
You can directly,

2081
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:38,410
you know,

2082
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:41,350
shaped their life and they're
looking for you to do that.

2083
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:43,630
And then they need you
around all the time.

2084
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:45,640
And they constantly want
you to hold them into,

2085
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:46,960
kicked them up and touch them.

2086
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:47,400
You know,

2087
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,270
the constantly screaming
for you to touch them.

2088
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:49,991
You know,

2089
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:50,131
it's,

2090
00:56:50,131 --> 00:56:52,480
it's amazing to watch
that from the source,

2091
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:52,931
you know,

2092
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:54,130
to see an uh,

2093
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,581
you know,

2094
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:54,760
uh,

2095
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,090
uh,

2096
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:55,720
uh,

2097
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,710
a life form,

2098
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:01,460
a unique life form with no language
that's communicating with just intent and

2099
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:02,051
noises.

2100
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:04,960
It wants you to do things for it and
what it wants you to do is real simple,

2101
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:05,201
wants,

2102
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:07,180
love and wants to play.

2103
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,680
It doesn't want to be left alone.

2104
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:09,953
It makes sense.

2105
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:11,710
So much work.

2106
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:12,340
Yeah.

2107
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,173
So how do you,

2108
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:13,721
how do you,

2109
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:14,110
uh,

2110
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:14,790
keep saying,

2111
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:15,080
dude,

2112
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,840
you have like a workout you
do or meditation or yoga
or anything that I think on

2113
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:19,901
it.

2114
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:20,020
Yeah,

2115
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,700
them right now I have been
burning the candle on both ends.

2116
00:57:22,701 --> 00:57:25,690
So I don't know that I have to go down
and search your dad cause I don't think

2117
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:27,100
I've been doing a good job at hits.

2118
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:29,620
I think of being the handling things.

2119
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:32,500
But I'm feeding lately my body
kind of giving me signals like,

2120
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:32,900
hey man,

2121
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,090
you are going over the edge.

2122
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,120
You don't need to tone it down,

2123
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,250
smoke cigarettes or anything.

2124
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:37,510
Do you know that's good.

2125
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,690
So now they workout has
always been my thing.

2126
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:41,201
But then again,

2127
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:43,510
when you don't have the
physical time anymore,

2128
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:44,081
we're and everything.

2129
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:46,060
So I need to find the tie ins to do it.

2130
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,060
And so that's kind of what I'm working on,

2131
00:57:48,061 --> 00:57:50,790
on being able to just train
again and do all this stuff.

2132
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,950
Cause I mean with martial arts
I've been doing it 20 years.

2133
00:57:53,951 --> 00:57:57,040
It's been like one of the things that
you do day in and day out forever and

2134
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,330
suddenly you don't do that anymore.

2135
00:57:58,331 --> 00:57:58,660
You're like,

2136
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,081
Oh shit,

2137
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:00,430
your body goes through withdrawal.

2138
00:58:00,431 --> 00:58:00,720
You know,

2139
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,720
you feel weird.

2140
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:02,554
Do you feel,

2141
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:06,220
so it seems key to do it cause it
doesn't matter how busy you get,

2142
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:07,900
it's key to your health in a way.

2143
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:08,231
Yeah.

2144
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:10,300
I remember I tore a ligament in my leg.

2145
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:13,780
It was the first like real serious
injury that took me out for months and

2146
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:14,141
months.

2147
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:16,540
I tore a knee ligament and
how to get it reconstructed.

2148
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,720
And then I didn't work
out for a long time.

2149
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,510
And it was the first time in my
life that I hadn't done that.

2150
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:22,870
Right.

2151
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:23,171
You know?

2152
00:58:23,171 --> 00:58:26,500
And I had always used martial
arts for blowing off steam.

2153
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:29,170
And now all of a sudden I was
at this place where I was like,

2154
00:58:29,171 --> 00:58:29,500
wow,

2155
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,010
I just,

2156
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:30,280
I,

2157
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:30,970
you know,

2158
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:31,220
I,

2159
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:31,460
I,

2160
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,880
I'm not in control of my emotions as well.

2161
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:35,860
I'm like more short temper.

2162
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:36,580
I'm not in,

2163
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,290
I don't feel my body the same way.

2164
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:40,540
Like you know when you
use your body a lot,

2165
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,230
you develop this like real tight
relationship with your body.

2166
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:45,830
Like how it moves and,

2167
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,980
and it makes you want to eat healthy.

2168
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:52,090
It makes you want to take
care of it because you realize
that it's communicating

2169
00:58:52,091 --> 00:58:54,670
with you is communicating with
you through movement and through,

2170
00:58:54,671 --> 00:58:54,970
you know,

2171
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:55,550
your,

2172
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:55,760
you know,

2173
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,080
your desire and intent to do something
and it's actual ability to perform what

2174
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:02,590
your desire and intent is and you get
this relationship with your body and I

2175
00:59:02,591 --> 00:59:03,640
didn't have it anymore.

2176
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,990
I had no relationship with my body.

2177
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:05,471
I was like,

2178
00:59:05,471 --> 00:59:05,651
wow,

2179
00:59:05,651 --> 00:59:06,161
this is weird.

2180
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:09,400
Everyday I just wake up and
eat and piss and go through,

2181
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:09,881
you know what I'm saying?

2182
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:10,700
I just go to my,

2183
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,830
that's what I'm using my body for.

2184
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:13,930
It's just a vehicle I'm
not communicating with.

2185
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,930
Welcome to the life of
most people in the ward.

2186
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,480
Yeah.

2187
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:16,800
Right.

2188
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,000
You communicate with
your body through things,

2189
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:19,301
you know,

2190
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:20,021
through sex,

2191
00:59:20,021 --> 00:59:20,410
through,

2192
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:21,380
through martial arts,

2193
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:22,101
through dance,

2194
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:22,641
through the,

2195
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:22,881
you know,

2196
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:26,870
you communicate when you require your
body to move in very specific ways.

2197
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:27,410
Yeah.

2198
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:27,771
You know,

2199
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:29,180
and there's,

2200
00:59:29,181 --> 00:59:29,481
there's,

2201
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:31,340
there's a consciousness to that that's,

2202
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:31,700
you know,

2203
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,110
very uniquely its own,

2204
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,610
the consciousness of the full couldn't
cut the full focus and concentration of

2205
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:39,410
someone utilizing their body.

2206
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,071
You know,

2207
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:43,520
because I really do believe that
that is an element of the whole,

2208
00:59:43,521 --> 00:59:44,810
and that you have to,

2209
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:46,520
in order to be optimally healthy,

2210
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:50,750
you have to have the whole together and
have to have the mind must be healthy.

2211
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:52,190
The consciousness must be healthy,

2212
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,210
the body must be held.

2213
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:53,950
Totally.

2214
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:54,380
Yeah.

2215
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,860
And I went through a long period,

2216
00:59:55,861 --> 00:59:56,631
it was like six months,

2217
00:59:56,631 --> 00:59:56,871
you know,

2218
00:59:56,871 --> 00:59:59,720
rehabbing my knee after the surgery
and everything like that where I still

2219
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,160
couldn't kick a bag,

2220
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:02,270
I couldn't box,

2221
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:03,050
I couldn't,

2222
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:03,800
couldn't run.

2223
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,450
That really says,

2224
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:04,670
yeah.

2225
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:05,900
It makes you realize,

2226
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:08,870
it makes you really fucking appreciate
your body when you can though.

2227
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:09,773
Seriously.

2228
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,720
So what martial arts
where you're doing it?

2229
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:13,171
It's funny,

2230
01:00:13,171 --> 01:00:14,820
I started out regionally,

2231
01:00:14,821 --> 01:00:15,210
you know,

2232
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:20,210
with watching the TV series too many
times I was dislike how long to go on the

2233
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:24,270
mountain with Master Yada
showing me how to fly in the air.

2234
01:00:24,271 --> 01:00:27,480
And it also started out with a lot
of Chinese martial arts and then I

2235
01:00:27,481 --> 01:00:32,420
progressively moved to more self defense
oriented thing and then kind of AED

2236
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,750
opposite of what most people do.

2237
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:36,300
We start out with very aggressive
and then they mellow out.

2238
01:00:36,301 --> 01:00:37,290
I started out with the whole,

2239
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:40,960
it's all about Zan and boy three and
thing and now and just like shut up.

2240
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:41,830
I just rice solely,

2241
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:47,670
just all about combat sports and
the submission grappling in MMA,

2242
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,593
the kind of thing.

2243
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:49,610
Well I think you know,

2244
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:49,961
there,

2245
01:00:49,961 --> 01:00:50,890
there is uh,

2246
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,920
there's definitely a mindset to the
eastern martial arts that is being lost in

2247
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:00,130
the transition to combat sports.

2248
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:00,401
You know,

2249
01:01:00,401 --> 01:01:01,630
to look at in combat sports,

2250
01:01:01,631 --> 01:01:02,170
there's,

2251
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:04,390
there's something to be
gained from that mindset.

2252
01:01:04,391 --> 01:01:06,210
What people don't
understand is that like the,

2253
01:01:06,211 --> 01:01:09,760
the ancient Japanese in
a martial arts masters,

2254
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:10,181
you know,

2255
01:01:10,181 --> 01:01:13,930
the reason why they practice
Zen thinking wasn't because,

2256
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:14,860
uh,

2257
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,790
it's just,

2258
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:16,470
you know,

2259
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:18,970
a thing they did that you know,

2260
01:01:18,971 --> 01:01:21,000
really doesn't need to
be replicated today.

2261
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,430
Know what they were doing
was in order to have a way,

2262
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,380
in order to have a way
of thinking of life,

2263
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:31,060
they were disciplining the mind to behave
on very specific frequencies and to

2264
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:32,620
have control over itself.

2265
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:36,190
And that in your discipline and
in your honor and your code,

2266
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,920
you have control over your emotions.

2267
01:01:38,921 --> 01:01:40,990
You have control over your body better.

2268
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:44,830
You have control over your psyche better
because you have an ethic because you

2269
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,520
have a coat.

2270
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,210
And that there's,

2271
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,710
there's a reason for that.

2272
01:01:47,711 --> 01:01:48,310
This is,

2273
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,900
it benefits you in combat.

2274
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,300
It benefits you to be sturdy of mind.

2275
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,820
So in order to practice
this mental discipline,

2276
01:01:54,821 --> 01:01:57,310
it actually puts you in a
better position for victory.

2277
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:58,670
That's why it's there.

2278
01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:59,543
Shut down.

2279
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:00,413
I remember,

2280
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:01,410
I'm not the,

2281
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,850
I think are kind of a we pattern.

2282
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:04,470
So every time I've coached in photography,

2283
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:06,630
no I got,

2284
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:07,320
I got freaked out.

2285
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,570
I get scared when I have to fight.

2286
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:09,180
You know,

2287
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,080
some guys are,

2288
01:02:10,081 --> 01:02:10,321
you know,

2289
01:02:10,321 --> 01:02:12,210
you read a checklist dial or Randy,

2290
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:13,220
these guys who speak to date,

2291
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,030
they don't know what
it means to be afraid.

2292
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:15,241
I'm like,

2293
01:02:15,241 --> 01:02:16,190
what the fuck you mean?

2294
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,600
It's like the scariest thing in the world.

2295
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:20,040
There's this guy was being
training to knock your

2296
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,730
head off.

2297
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:24,060
So I walked up and the
days before the tiny,

2298
01:02:24,061 --> 01:02:25,140
when I stepped on the mat,

2299
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,960
I feel like every singing
my body's shutting down.

2300
01:02:27,961 --> 01:02:30,750
I'm about to die kind of
feeling you every scene,

2301
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:31,584
freezers and,

2302
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,850
and so I can see how,

2303
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:33,090
you know,

2304
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:37,470
the whole zen thing is not about some
having some strange mystical authorities

2305
01:02:37,471 --> 01:02:38,304
about how the,

2306
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,510
you deal with the fact that this is what
you're gonna do and you do it without

2307
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,750
too much attachment or because
attachment will breed fear.

2308
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:48,630
Fear will shut you down
and then you'll get killed.

2309
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:49,240
Yeah.

2310
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,490
You got to control your body.

2311
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:50,850
Yeah.

2312
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,380
That's really ultimately what it is.

2313
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:53,090
And the,

2314
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:57,000
the ability to control your mind is
the same as the ability to control your

2315
01:02:57,001 --> 01:02:57,560
body.

2316
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,860
Cause if you can't control your mind,

2317
01:02:58,861 --> 01:03:00,000
you can't control your emotions.

2318
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:02,220
That can run a mock your possibilities.

2319
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,590
The real problem is you're intelligent.

2320
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:05,603
That's the real problem.

2321
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:06,540
And it's true.

2322
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:07,530
And when you're intelligent,

2323
01:03:07,531 --> 01:03:08,430
you realize,

2324
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:08,851
hey,

2325
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,060
we don't have to do this.

2326
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:14,160
This is an elective choice you're making
to go and enter your body and just some

2327
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:15,510
physical combat with another man.

2328
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,353
That's,

2329
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:17,910
that's intelligence,

2330
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,130
that's intelligent.

2331
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:20,371
You're,

2332
01:03:20,371 --> 01:03:20,671
you're,

2333
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,560
you're a smart person to think that way.

2334
01:03:22,561 --> 01:03:24,300
Your body thinks it's going to fight,

2335
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:24,661
you know,

2336
01:03:24,661 --> 01:03:25,740
and your body doesn't want to do it.

2337
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:26,574
So it starts,

2338
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:27,091
you know,

2339
01:03:27,091 --> 01:03:29,340
just really essentially
trying to pull you out of it.

2340
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:30,480
But I didn't have the same time.

2341
01:03:30,481 --> 01:03:33,930
It's like the most instructive thing in
the ward because he teaches you to get

2342
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:35,920
rid of attachments because you know,

2343
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:39,480
you'll leave with attachment of fierce
and all these things about you hope that

2344
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:42,660
the universe is not going to do this
and that to you and that you can end the

2345
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,400
realities in combat.

2346
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,061
Like in life.

2347
01:03:45,061 --> 01:03:46,260
You don't control Jack Shit,

2348
01:03:46,261 --> 01:03:50,040
you do the best you can and then it's
out of your aunts and you need to be able

2349
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:54,420
to live through it despite the
obvious fear that kicks in from south

2350
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:55,141
preservation.

2351
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:55,711
And so he's like,

2352
01:03:55,711 --> 01:03:56,450
hey man,

2353
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:57,061
bait man,

2354
01:03:57,061 --> 01:03:58,170
maybe you die in a second.

2355
01:03:58,290 --> 01:03:59,123
So what?

2356
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,210
It's not good.

2357
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,800
It doesn't feel good to work hard,

2358
01:04:01,801 --> 01:04:02,820
but it's good to work hard,

2359
01:04:02,821 --> 01:04:03,110
you know,

2360
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:03,450
you know,

2361
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:04,170
it's good.

2362
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:05,280
It's good to train hard,

2363
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:07,650
it's good to push your
body and your spirit,

2364
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:08,131
you know?

2365
01:04:08,131 --> 01:04:08,941
And that is a part of it.

2366
01:04:08,941 --> 01:04:09,774
Your spirit,

2367
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,111
you know,

2368
01:04:10,111 --> 01:04:12,050
I have friends that are men that have,

2369
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:13,080
and then I'm not talking about you,

2370
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:13,770
Brian,

2371
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:14,780
that are um,

2372
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,350
that have no experience whatsoever in,

2373
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:18,860
um,

2374
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:22,680
in any sort of difficult
physical endeavor.

2375
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:23,760
And it haunts them.

2376
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:24,871
It haunts them.

2377
01:04:24,871 --> 01:04:28,260
Like they get insecure when they're
around guys who are athletic,

2378
01:04:28,261 --> 01:04:28,430
it'll,

2379
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,100
they'll say,

2380
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:29,431
you know,

2381
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:34,230
dicky things and it's like to disarm
this person of their masculinity because

2382
01:04:34,231 --> 01:04:38,100
they've never truly face their own
physicality and they're terrified of it.

2383
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:38,881
It's fascinating.

2384
01:04:38,881 --> 01:04:40,050
It's fascinating to watch.

2385
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:43,570
Watch some have like these little weird
sort of semi meltdowns and they're

2386
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,010
around,

2387
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:44,281
you know,

2388
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:47,580
strong men and he's like the least you
train the tougher you think you are.

2389
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:48,540
That's the way it goes.

2390
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:49,351
You know?

2391
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:50,184
He's like,

2392
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,630
no worries about,

2393
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:52,890
oh I'm this stuff got done.

2394
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:53,611
When you step up,

2395
01:04:53,611 --> 01:04:56,490
you quickly find out that just guys
are funny when they want to talk about

2396
01:04:56,491 --> 01:04:59,640
Monday food and bar fights
toy ya to four 15 times.

2397
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,001
It's like,

2398
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:00,380
yeah,

2399
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:00,990
it's fine.

2400
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:01,221
Oh,

2401
01:05:01,221 --> 01:05:01,631
you're fine.

2402
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:05,220
15 people that don't know what the fuck
they're doing or your soccer punching

2403
01:05:05,221 --> 01:05:07,620
people when you're envious,

2404
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,400
this no train at all and
you've knocked down 15 dudes,

2405
01:05:11,401 --> 01:05:14,250
I'm okay know you're going to get
fucked up if you keep this up.

2406
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:17,800
One day you got to run into boss route
and at the bar and he's going to fucking

2407
01:05:17,801 --> 01:05:18,310
do what I was.

2408
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:19,870
Instructional videos on your head,

2409
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,311
Bang,

2410
01:05:21,311 --> 01:05:21,980
Bang,

2411
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:22,610
Sag.

2412
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:27,610
Imagine hope to put some the bully asshole
and you run into a guy like boss and

2413
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:28,360
then a bar.

2414
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:28,841
Oh,

2415
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:29,830
what a mistake.

2416
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,570
Especially if he tries to be nice to you.

2417
01:05:31,571 --> 01:05:33,220
And you mistake that for him being weak.

2418
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:36,040
Lipsey's yeah,

2419
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:37,180
we were watching,

2420
01:05:37,181 --> 01:05:42,181
I had Eddie Bravo in here the other
day and we were watching a Minotauro

2421
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:42,370
Nogueira versus Bob Sapp.

2422
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:42,521
Oh,

2423
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,060
that's awesome.

2424
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:44,470
That's classic classic.

2425
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:45,500
Brian,

2426
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:45,920
you,

2427
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,770
you saw it too because it's really,

2428
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:48,100
it was a,

2429
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,690
it was a cartoon fight,

2430
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:50,980
a real cartoon fight.

2431
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:51,770
And one of the,

2432
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:56,770
in my opinion's the best
example of technique over
power that this Guy Minataro

2433
01:05:58,391 --> 01:06:03,391
this 230 pound guy was ever repeat
this 350 plus pound monster of a man.

2434
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,670
Didn't even look real.

2435
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:08,530
That is an amazing,

2436
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:09,430
amazing fight.

2437
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,121
And that's a,

2438
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:10,570
I mean,

2439
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:11,201
that's a guy,

2440
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:11,860
I mean editorial,

2441
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,430
he's a,

2442
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:14,290
he's a real martial artist.

2443
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:15,503
He is a,

2444
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,120
he's a real like true warrior.

2445
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:19,811
You know,

2446
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:24,811
a guy who became a master of Jujitsu and
then became a great striker to add onto

2447
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:28,210
it and was just willing to fight anybody.

2448
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,670
And I think it started way back in
the day cause I mean when he was,

2449
01:06:30,671 --> 01:06:32,110
I forget Danny 11 whatever,

2450
01:06:32,111 --> 01:06:36,250
when he had that car accident and he was
sitting like hospital for like a year,

2451
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,350
a year where they tell him
you'll never walk again.

2452
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:43,120
Maybe you law may be definitely no
sparks and he goes on to become an MMA

2453
01:06:43,121 --> 01:06:46,300
champion and say they'd say
something about a guy's personality.

2454
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,490
I remember when he was
at the top of his game,

2455
01:06:48,491 --> 01:06:48,651
man,

2456
01:06:48,651 --> 01:06:50,980
when he was triangling
everybody and you know,

2457
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:54,250
you just saw you Jitsu on a level
that you had never seen before.

2458
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:58,490
Like all the sudden this bad ass
heavyweight who was tough as fuck though,

2459
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,490
who had a wicked guard.

2460
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:05,550
Oh wicked Jujitsu game was
hitting Anaconda chokes on
dudes and fucking strangle

2461
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:07,030
him from his back and you're like,

2462
01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:07,864
Whoa,

2463
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,670
do it is on another level.

2464
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:10,780
That was like,

2465
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:15,640
to me like a real victory for technique
and mixed mixed martial arts in my

2466
01:07:15,641 --> 01:07:19,810
opinion in editorial like embodies like
this era where people like learn like

2467
01:07:19,811 --> 01:07:20,320
Whoa,

2468
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,460
that's possible too.

2469
01:07:21,461 --> 01:07:22,090
Like that was,

2470
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:24,190
we were not seeing guys on,

2471
01:07:24,191 --> 01:07:28,420
on the highest levels submitting guys
the way Minataro was not as you know,

2472
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,300
he's so awesome.

2473
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,400
How about the Cro cop fight?

2474
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:33,460
He gets battered by Cro
cop in the first round,

2475
01:07:33,461 --> 01:07:38,461
right fucking smashed head kicks
by the guy who knocked out.

2476
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,940
Everybody would had cakes and somehow or
another he eats it and he's okay and he

2477
01:07:42,941 --> 01:07:44,830
gets up at the bottom of the round at the,

2478
01:07:44,831 --> 01:07:48,010
at the end of the round he gets head
kicked and dropped like seconds before the

2479
01:07:48,011 --> 01:07:50,830
round ends and he thought the referee
stopped the fight and the referee was

2480
01:07:50,831 --> 01:07:50,921
like,

2481
01:07:50,921 --> 01:07:51,160
nope.

2482
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:51,701
The rounds over.

2483
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:51,881
He's like,

2484
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:52,190
okay,

2485
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:53,410
then stop this fucking fight.

2486
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,360
And he goes back and he takes him down.

2487
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:56,770
He armbars I'm in the second round,

2488
01:07:56,771 --> 01:07:59,200
but he took up painting
in that first round like,

2489
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,161
God damn,

2490
01:08:00,161 --> 01:08:01,030
that dude is tough.

2491
01:08:01,031 --> 01:08:01,201
And like,

2492
01:08:01,201 --> 01:08:03,760
you've got to love it as a guys or
stuck or rabbi or does the guys,

2493
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:07,450
all my crazy wars Sakharova by
the time his career was over,

2494
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:09,640
he was essentially going in to the,

2495
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,110
to the ring with his legs.

2496
01:08:11,111 --> 01:08:16,111
Mummify his knees were so bad that he
would have the tape that would go all the

2497
01:08:16,521 --> 01:08:19,550
way up to the top of his thigh and
all the way down to his ankles.

2498
01:08:19,551 --> 01:08:20,510
It was crazy.

2499
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:21,110
Yeah,

2500
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,920
that was a,

2501
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,870
that was another guy that was like a real,

2502
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:26,000
like classic technique,

2503
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,820
a technique and heart oversize guy.

2504
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:32,270
Remember when he fought Quinton Jackson
and Quinto kept his land rover and he

2505
01:08:32,271 --> 01:08:33,104
got his back.

2506
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:34,870
I'm just flowing.

2507
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,210
I'm like,

2508
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:35,631
Jesus,

2509
01:08:35,631 --> 01:08:38,280
how do you stay relaxed when
some monster is lifting?

2510
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:39,111
Doing well.

2511
01:08:39,111 --> 01:08:40,400
His Jujitsu was beautiful.

2512
01:08:40,401 --> 01:08:41,420
He was so tough.

2513
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,090
He was so like willing to take punishment.

2514
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:44,661
You know,

2515
01:08:44,661 --> 01:08:45,200
he was,

2516
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,460
he was technical,

2517
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:47,810
but it was also brave.

2518
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,630
He's willing to take punishment
and essentially really,

2519
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,220
he should have been 170 pounder.

2520
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:52,700
Yup.

2521
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:52,881
I mean,

2522
01:08:52,881 --> 01:08:56,540
he was walking around at 189 pounds
without cutting any weight at all.

2523
01:08:56,541 --> 01:09:00,820
And he was a little fat and he was taken
on the heavy weights and he mentioned

2524
01:09:00,821 --> 01:09:05,360
that he thought that was kind of a
career he would have had that guy fucking

2525
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:08,000
beat Conan Sylvia with an arm bar.

2526
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:09,200
Remember that Shit.

2527
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:11,090
Kokona and went for a fucking Kamora.

2528
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:16,091
He spun around and caught him in an
arm bar that was a pure victory of

2529
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:17,691
technique,

2530
01:09:17,691 --> 01:09:18,410
oversize.

2531
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:20,330
That was a clear example of that.

2532
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,200
He was an amazing fighter
and know another one who was,

2533
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:24,501
you know,

2534
01:09:24,501 --> 01:09:26,990
embodied that Japanese warrior spirit,

2535
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:27,410
you know,

2536
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:30,590
and that's what they loved about him
and his willingness to go out there and

2537
01:09:30,591 --> 01:09:32,210
throw it down with anybody,

2538
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:32,570
anyone,

2539
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:35,300
even Vendelay Silva who beat
the fuck out of him three times.

2540
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:36,180
He kept stepping up,

2541
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:37,190
kept stepping up,

2542
01:09:37,191 --> 01:09:37,820
man.

2543
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:38,571
And that last one,

2544
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:41,520
when he got knocked out and Vandelay
caught him with two punches and it

2545
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,250
literally,

2546
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:46,520
he sent him flying through the air
as he skid unconscious on his back.

2547
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:48,020
Like wow,

2548
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,170
the Melvin Manhoef fight when
he fought Melvin Manhoef.

2549
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:51,410
No,

2550
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:51,801
Jesus,

2551
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:52,760
I feel bad for the guy.

2552
01:09:52,761 --> 01:09:54,530
And he just took so many beatings.

2553
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,520
Oh my God.

2554
01:09:55,521 --> 01:09:57,770
No one's taken more
beatings and Sakharova dude,

2555
01:09:57,771 --> 01:10:00,770
Melvin Manhoef is a destroyer.

2556
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,570
When that guy starts teeing off on you,

2557
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:05,900
he's one of the most terrifying
strikers in any martial law.

2558
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:06,740
You know,

2559
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:11,740
when he's attacking and he's just so
strong and fast and just blasting Sakuraba

2560
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,230
and the fucking guy came back
after that and he kept fighting.

2561
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:16,040
I mean he's,

2562
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:16,873
he's still fighting.

2563
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,120
Yeah,

2564
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:17,400
I know.

2565
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:17,780
I mean,

2566
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,640
I feel it's weird is perverted.

2567
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:19,800
Like,

2568
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,050
well I want to see him fight,

2569
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:22,250
but then I want him to retire,

2570
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:22,610
you know?

2571
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:22,941
Oh,

2572
01:10:22,941 --> 01:10:24,320
I would love to him to retire.

2573
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:25,520
We can watch this old fights.

2574
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:26,840
So many classics.

2575
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,290
He was involved in so many
fight of the year candidates,

2576
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:30,770
you know,

2577
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:30,951
I mean,

2578
01:10:30,951 --> 01:10:32,000
even when he was broken up,

2579
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:34,640
when it was that like a year ago or two
years ago when you had to fight with

2580
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:35,241
Gallese Guy,

2581
01:10:35,241 --> 01:10:35,910
I think he was,

2582
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:37,890
or he pulled the guy in
any bar and a guy like,

2583
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:39,690
he seemed like 50 straight times,

2584
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:40,941
no protection.

2585
01:10:40,941 --> 01:10:44,990
And the guy stayed with it so he could
get the knee bar and wind define how do

2586
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,130
you stay with that technique?

2587
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:47,840
Fuck for,

2588
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:49,160
it's amazing.

2589
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,870
He's got unbelievable determination.

2590
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:51,920
What about the Xerox guys?

2591
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:52,581
Fight wears ear,

2592
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,710
fell off his ear.

2593
01:10:54,711 --> 01:10:55,281
Literally it's,

2594
01:10:55,281 --> 01:10:55,750
it's a,

2595
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:59,030
Sakharova has these
gigantic cauliflower ears.

2596
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:03,110
So for people who don't know what that
means when you wrestle a lot or you get

2597
01:11:03,111 --> 01:11:04,070
hit in the ear a lot,

2598
01:11:04,071 --> 01:11:05,450
when it breaks up the tissue,

2599
01:11:05,451 --> 01:11:08,660
it fills up with fluid and
blood and then it hardens it.

2600
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,800
Like it becomes like almost like Cartlidge
like really fixed up and you have to

2601
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:13,890
have that cut out.

2602
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,060
And a lot of guys,

2603
01:11:15,061 --> 01:11:17,310
they get an ear that becomes like this.

2604
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:19,980
I mean Lou or loose like a
mouse is under their skin.

2605
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:20,310
It's,

2606
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:21,420
and that's what it
looked like with soccer.

2607
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:22,860
Rob of the whole thing was deformed.

2608
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,390
Randy coture actually uses his
in grappling cause it's hard,

2609
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:27,661
right?

2610
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:29,460
So when he takes guys down,

2611
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:33,390
he'll actually like shove his ear
and to parts of them and make them

2612
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:34,260
uncomfortable.

2613
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,660
He'll fucking jab them with his ears,

2614
01:11:36,661 --> 01:11:36,961
man.

2615
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:37,261
Those are,

2616
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:39,270
those are hard weapons
on the side of his head.

2617
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:40,500
It's really kind of crazy.

2618
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:45,680
But soccer rob was here was really
fucked up and it had always had tape on.

2619
01:11:45,891 --> 01:11:47,880
It was always getting cut
and training and shed.

2620
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:49,770
And this dude hit him with something.

2621
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:50,670
I forgot what he hit him with,

2622
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:53,130
but the fucking ear was
hanging off of his head.

2623
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:55,070
It was just hanging on
and there's a romps.

2624
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:55,591
This is like,

2625
01:11:55,591 --> 01:11:56,041
dude,

2626
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:56,874
you're fucking ear.

2627
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,050
Like even stopped fighting.

2628
01:11:58,051 --> 01:11:58,381
It was like,

2629
01:11:58,381 --> 01:11:59,071
Whoa,

2630
01:11:59,071 --> 01:11:59,880
dude,

2631
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,020
you might want to look at that.

2632
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,340
What's going on here?

2633
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,550
They stitched it up as he
fought since then he did.

2634
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:05,880
He's,

2635
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:06,260
you know,

2636
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:06,660
my rating.

2637
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:07,630
I hope he stops.

2638
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:08,803
He's not going to stop.

2639
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:09,781
He's not going to stop,

2640
01:12:09,781 --> 01:12:10,860
but they're not going to have them stop.

2641
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:11,551
They're going to,

2642
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:13,770
they're going to keep asking him to
keep doing it and he'll get doughnut.

2643
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:14,580
But I mean,

2644
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,830
if new hires Meyer to [inaudible],

2645
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:19,350
they would pay it and we'd like all the
legends and then mellow matches and they

2646
01:12:19,351 --> 01:12:20,370
would even make sense.

2647
01:12:20,371 --> 01:12:21,880
At least throw him in with werewolves.

2648
01:12:21,881 --> 01:12:22,210
Yeah.

2649
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:23,130
That's just fuck it up.

2650
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,090
Is He,

2651
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:24,990
does he still smoke?

2652
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:26,040
She,

2653
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:26,340
you know,

2654
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,630
I'd never known to reality.

2655
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:31,440
You'd always hear the story about hymns
chain smoking and they can all the time.

2656
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:32,340
That's what I always heard.

2657
01:12:32,341 --> 01:12:33,420
I think that's true,

2658
01:12:33,421 --> 01:12:33,940
man.

2659
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:34,773
Yeah.

2660
01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:35,160
Yeah.

2661
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,000
He trained hard,

2662
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:37,470
but I'm pretty sure he actually chained,

2663
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:38,700
smoked and drank.

2664
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:43,140
They lead.

2665
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,790
Ever make a movie about that guy.

2666
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:45,720
He was amazing.

2667
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:50,340
Such a diverse culture because they
are so by the book in so many ways.

2668
01:12:50,341 --> 01:12:54,390
But when the guys golf
model they really go,

2669
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:54,571
yeah,

2670
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:56,940
they get Mohawks and
tattoo their whole body.

2671
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:58,170
And there's one guy I had,

2672
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,560
I love this guy that I put in the book
isn't there is eat Q is the zen master

2673
01:13:03,841 --> 01:13:04,380
from,

2674
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:07,050
I want to say the 39 [inaudible]
49 or something like that.

2675
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,270
And this is your book
on the Warrior's path.

2676
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:11,220
These one is the one
that's called religion,

2677
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:12,660
religion book.

2678
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:17,370
This dude was the illegitimate
son of the emperor of Japan.

2679
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:19,500
And so they add to kind of his man,

2680
01:13:19,501 --> 01:13:22,530
just hit him in a monastery somewhere
so that he wouldn't get killed.

2681
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:23,040
Imbalance,

2682
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:23,821
conspiracy,

2683
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:25,580
trying to get rid of the possible here.

2684
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,011
So you know,

2685
01:13:26,011 --> 01:13:30,090
this poor kid grew up in the middle of
this fucked up zen monastery in the cold

2686
01:13:30,091 --> 01:13:30,924
and whatever,

2687
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,150
just trying to stay alive and so fine.

2688
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:33,331
You know,

2689
01:13:33,331 --> 01:13:34,890
not the most fun in the ward,

2690
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,070
but he goes up,

2691
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:36,923
no way.

2692
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:38,110
Absolute genius.

2693
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:38,881
Everybody said,

2694
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:39,241
Jesus,

2695
01:13:39,241 --> 01:13:40,600
nobody get us Zanda way.

2696
01:13:40,601 --> 01:13:42,290
This guy does his sorts marriages.

2697
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:45,510
So these is so that precisely
because he's so smart.

2698
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:49,830
He just flipped him off one day and he
decided when they give you mean Zandy

2699
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:50,281
every seen,

2700
01:13:50,281 --> 01:13:54,450
they called the certificate
of enlightenment where a
master certified a yard.

2701
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:55,290
Truly enlightened.

2702
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:55,830
Wow.

2703
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:57,060
He picked it up and he was like,

2704
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:59,040
certificate of enlightenment.

2705
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:00,150
Are you fucking kidding me?

2706
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:00,451
You know,

2707
01:14:00,451 --> 01:14:02,400
he burned it and he was like,

2708
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:02,900
come on.

2709
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:03,690
You know,

2710
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:04,740
and that that is pretty,

2711
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:05,191
pretty fast.

2712
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:05,600
I sued.

2713
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,880
Really mean and trying to keep
him in the fold by giving him,

2714
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:09,091
you know,

2715
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:10,820
will make you add both of these mourners.

2716
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:12,280
Three step a week later,

2717
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,270
nobody can find him.

2718
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,540
They find this poem that
he left behind saying,

2719
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:18,550
[inaudible] Jesus a
week in this monastery.

2720
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:19,440
I can't take it anymore.

2721
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:20,650
If anybody's looking for me,

2722
01:14:20,651 --> 01:14:24,610
I mean they're at the brothel or at the
Saki sharp and that's the rest of his

2723
01:14:24,611 --> 01:14:25,000
life.

2724
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,590
He goes off being does cut off one.

2725
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:30,290
That in teacher was main
passions are Zana uh,

2726
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:31,710
hookers and sad.

2727
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,790
That's all daddy loves,

2728
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,633
you know,

2729
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:37,530
eat Q is a key.

2730
01:14:37,531 --> 01:14:39,400
K why you wow,

2731
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:40,840
it's my full time here.

2732
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:41,733
I loved it.

2733
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:43,600
I loved that he figured it out.

2734
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:43,870
Yeah.

2735
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:44,980
It sounds like my friend bad,

2736
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:48,760
Bobby Bobby from Vancouver,

2737
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:50,340
he figured it out.

2738
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:55,420
Hookers and just Saki bezerk
and end to him is Zen and uh,

2739
01:14:55,450 --> 01:15:00,400
it was all to heat it to he Maria Zan
was leaving life with full awareness.

2740
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:02,080
That is then you can do it.

2741
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,220
Meditating in a mountain,

2742
01:15:03,221 --> 01:15:04,240
if that makes you feel good,

2743
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:06,700
you can do it in a brothel
if that makes you feel good.

2744
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,800
It's about having full awareness.

2745
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:12,350
It's not about what you're doing as much
as about whether you are awake and the

2746
01:15:12,351 --> 01:15:16,020
are alive to what's going on or whether
you're going through the motion and

2747
01:15:16,021 --> 01:15:19,570
you're not really there and whether or
not you're just reacting to every single

2748
01:15:19,571 --> 01:15:21,140
thing mindlessly around you.

2749
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:22,030
And by the way,

2750
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:25,480
there really is no true enlightenment
because even true enlightenment for a

2751
01:15:25,481 --> 01:15:27,670
human is just true
enlightenment for human.

2752
01:15:27,671 --> 01:15:29,260
Our little brains can't really,

2753
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:30,880
we're not set up right.

2754
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:31,331
We have,

2755
01:15:31,331 --> 01:15:32,050
we have,

2756
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:35,440
we are essentially just like this old
shitty computer we have that's running all

2757
01:15:35,441 --> 01:15:36,274
this equipment.

2758
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,550
We were really do not have the hardware
to deal with the scenario at hand.

2759
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:41,471
We're fucked.

2760
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:44,380
So even enlightenment for a person
that's just enlightenment for a person,

2761
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:44,920
you know,

2762
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,440
like the best you could do
is keep it together mildly.

2763
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:48,011
Cause I mean,

2764
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:48,370
you know,

2765
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:48,761
I mean it's,

2766
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:49,310
it's so funny.

2767
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:50,143
It's was like,

2768
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:51,160
you know,

2769
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,190
everybody is searching
for that and you know,

2770
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:57,970
what you're searching for is ultimately
a better feeling about your experience

2771
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:58,390
here.

2772
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,110
Right.

2773
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,400
That's what we're all searching for.

2774
01:16:00,401 --> 01:16:03,250
Whether it's through religion or
through meditation or through Yoga.

2775
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,430
I have a friend who their
family was very religious,

2776
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:06,650
uh,

2777
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:07,660
until recently,

2778
01:16:07,661 --> 01:16:08,351
like a few years ago,

2779
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:09,184
they started to kind of,

2780
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:10,090
I don't know what,

2781
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:11,110
what brought him out of it,

2782
01:16:11,111 --> 01:16:16,111
but they started kind of
see it differently and now
they're experiencing their

2783
01:16:16,301 --> 01:16:20,740
first year or two years completely
away from their church and the wife is

2784
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:22,090
starting to get into yoga.

2785
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:22,631
And you know,

2786
01:16:22,631 --> 01:16:23,500
the dude is like,

2787
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:26,140
we experiment with a bunch of different
things and just trying to figure out

2788
01:16:26,141 --> 01:16:27,460
what the fuck is going on in the world.

2789
01:16:27,461 --> 01:16:29,830
But it's weird to watch
someone come out of it.

2790
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:30,880
It's weird to watch someone go,

2791
01:16:30,881 --> 01:16:31,714
you know what?

2792
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,410
Maybe maybe this is a mistake here.

2793
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,400
Well you guys are nice.

2794
01:16:36,401 --> 01:16:37,590
I enjoy hanging out with you.

2795
01:16:37,591 --> 01:16:38,710
But Shit,

2796
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:39,460
come on.

2797
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:40,630
Like they're,

2798
01:16:40,631 --> 01:16:43,810
their own mind has evolved their,

2799
01:16:43,811 --> 01:16:44,021
their,

2800
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:47,980
their personal consciousness
of all past an ideology.

2801
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:48,640
Right.

2802
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,230
And that's a big decision to me.

2803
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,260
Very hard.

2804
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:51,820
Huge.

2805
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,620
It's bigger than breaking
up with a girlfriend.

2806
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:55,560
I don't know about that.

2807
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:56,443
But

2808
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,740
it depends on how religion
you are religious you are.

2809
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:00,201
But if you're like,

2810
01:17:00,201 --> 01:17:02,310
I'm really active with the church
and then you're going to lunch,

2811
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:03,690
it's an arm,

2812
01:17:03,870 --> 01:17:04,840
it doesn't get any bigger.

2813
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:06,980
It also depends how tight that girl is.

2814
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:07,400
Yeah,

2815
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:07,660
yeah.

2816
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:08,260
That's true.

2817
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:08,770
Right.

2818
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:09,950
And whether or not she's a freak.

2819
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:10,310
Yeah.

2820
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:10,731
Whether or not,

2821
01:17:10,731 --> 01:17:10,971
you know,

2822
01:17:10,971 --> 01:17:12,320
just turn it loose for one day.

2823
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:13,071
She's loyal,

2824
01:17:13,071 --> 01:17:15,500
but you're trying to lose from one
day and she's in a fucking gang bang.

2825
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:18,740
And you can't take that gang bang back
and there's a thing where she always

2826
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:19,820
really wanted to get with a black guy,

2827
01:17:19,821 --> 01:17:20,654
but she never had

2828
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:22,620
no.

2829
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:23,600
The mom when she's loose,

2830
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:27,020
do you see that video of the
octopus walking out of the water?

2831
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,340
How creepy is that?

2832
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:28,521
Well,

2833
01:17:28,521 --> 01:17:32,480
you know there's a video of an
octopus climbing out of its aquarium,

2834
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:36,740
walking across the floor and going up
to another aquarium that's in the same

2835
01:17:36,741 --> 01:17:39,950
room and eating fish and then
climbing back and as aquarium.

2836
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:40,640
Yeah,

2837
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,200
we're seeing some,

2838
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,033
I know this,

2839
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,190
I haven't seen it,

2840
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:47,120
but the reason why I know this is because
a friend was trying to explain to me

2841
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:51,830
how intelligent octopuses are that they
can take food and put it in a jar and

2842
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:52,461
the octopus,

2843
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:57,461
we'll unscrew the jar and get at the food
and that a guy was missing some of his

2844
01:17:58,401 --> 01:18:02,030
tropical fish and he had a couple of
fish tanks and one of them was right next

2845
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:02,151
to,

2846
01:18:02,151 --> 01:18:03,920
you know the octopus is right
next to this one with like,

2847
01:18:03,921 --> 01:18:04,970
this is really expensive fish.

2848
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,980
It's fucking octopus was climbing out,

2849
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:09,170
climbing up into the next tank,

2850
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:13,220
lifting the fucking lid up and getting
inside and eating the fish and then

2851
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,720
climbing back to his place.

2852
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:15,370
Put a time.

2853
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:17,460
So I really thought about it.

2854
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:17,661
It's like,

2855
01:18:17,661 --> 01:18:17,991
listen,

2856
01:18:17,991 --> 01:18:18,741
if I hang out here,

2857
01:18:18,741 --> 01:18:20,930
this motherfuckers going to know
that I can get it to this tag.

2858
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:21,900
You know?

2859
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,830
So the dude had a set up a camera.

2860
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:25,670
He set up a camera and
caught this octopus.

2861
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:28,490
Still haven't seen the video though.

2862
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:29,301
So it might be harsh.

2863
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:31,080
It might be in that legend tweet.

2864
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,000
Yeah.

2865
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:32,833
Tweet it.

2866
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:33,390
You,

2867
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:36,050
you whoever's listening where
there's enough people listening.

2868
01:18:36,051 --> 01:18:36,930
We don't need to tweak this.

2869
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:37,873
This is ridiculous.

2870
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:39,861
I'm going to leave it at that,

2871
01:18:39,861 --> 01:18:40,694
Brian.

2872
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:41,580
Um,

2873
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:41,721
no,

2874
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:42,021
I mean,

2875
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:43,220
I tweeted so I can see it.

2876
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:44,181
I don't know if somebody,

2877
01:18:44,181 --> 01:18:44,470
yeah,

2878
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,740
if they find it folks tweeted,

2879
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:46,550
yeah,

2880
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:47,060
somebody,

2881
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:47,600
if it's out there,

2882
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,433
it might not be out there.

2883
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:49,520
I might not be real.

2884
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:50,571
But,

2885
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:51,050
um,

2886
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:51,800
uh,

2887
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,850
how do we get on this subject
of Octopus's killing things?

2888
01:18:55,851 --> 01:18:57,260
If the climbing out of being intelligent,

2889
01:18:58,050 --> 01:18:58,870
you have it.

2890
01:18:58,870 --> 01:18:59,451
You've seen the,

2891
01:18:59,451 --> 01:18:59,840
uh,

2892
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,111
the,

2893
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:00,291
uh,

2894
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:01,760
evidence for a cracking.

2895
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,990
Have you seen the evidence
for a giant octopus of legend?

2896
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:06,261
You know,

2897
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:11,261
there's always been a legend of an octopus
that can devour ships and you know,

2898
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:13,340
a huge whale eating well,

2899
01:19:13,341 --> 01:19:18,070
they actually have found evidence of this
thing like a really boy inside of your

2900
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:18,700
octopus.

2901
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:18,920
No,

2902
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:19,641
they found,

2903
01:19:19,641 --> 01:19:24,200
they actually found whale bones
and the whale bones are fucked up.

2904
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:28,520
And so that means there's something
that is big enough to go kill a god damn

2905
01:19:28,521 --> 01:19:29,300
well.

2906
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:34,300
And they also found fossilized
imprints of giant suction cups.

2907
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:36,380
And that's what leads him to
believe that the possibly,

2908
01:19:36,381 --> 01:19:36,700
see,

2909
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,920
the thing about an octopus
is there's no bones really.

2910
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,450
There's nothing going to be left.

2911
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:43,340
There's no fossilize octopus.

2912
01:19:43,341 --> 01:19:46,700
It's not like a bird or something else
where you can get the structure of the

2913
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:47,091
animal.

2914
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:47,331
There's,

2915
01:19:47,331 --> 01:19:47,601
you know,

2916
01:19:47,601 --> 01:19:50,000
it's essentially all soft
tissue except for its beak.

2917
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,170
So it dissolves.

2918
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,160
It doesn't exist anymore.

2919
01:19:52,161 --> 01:19:57,161
But it was on the ocean floor
that they had these imprints.

2920
01:19:57,171 --> 01:20:00,950
He's fossilized imprints of what looked
like massive suction cups of a huge

2921
01:20:00,951 --> 01:20:01,784
tentacle.

2922
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:03,800
And by that they're,

2923
01:20:03,801 --> 01:20:07,100
they're making this pretty
reasonable hypothesis,

2924
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:07,501
you know,

2925
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:07,951
and the,

2926
01:20:07,951 --> 01:20:10,590
the bones of the whale
being all fucked up.

2927
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:12,180
And then these giant suction cups,

2928
01:20:12,181 --> 01:20:12,960
they're like,

2929
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:13,201
oh,

2930
01:20:13,201 --> 01:20:16,020
they're probably was this
real monster but lived.

2931
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:16,201
I mean,

2932
01:20:16,201 --> 01:20:17,220
if there's a whale,

2933
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,160
why wait?

2934
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,400
Just a whale's ridiculous.

2935
01:20:19,401 --> 01:20:21,200
And it's right there.

2936
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:22,230
It's weird as it gets,

2937
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:22,441
man,

2938
01:20:22,441 --> 01:20:23,370
a super smart,

2939
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:24,360
giant big thing.

2940
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:27,030
They can't do anything
and it has to breathe air.

2941
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:27,750
You know,

2942
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:31,020
like why it lives in the ocean
and it breathes air like Watson.

2943
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:31,500
I know.

2944
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:32,580
That's so stupid.

2945
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:35,250
You know the design that
I didn't quite workout.

2946
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,920
It lives in the water but yet can't,

2947
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:39,630
it can go down the water for a little bit,

2948
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:42,390
but it's got to come up for air
and then it can't even stop.

2949
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:44,520
It can't stop because of it stops.

2950
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:46,560
Then it'll fucking sink
and then it'll drown.

2951
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:49,223
That's fucking,

2952
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:49,890
how do they,

2953
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:50,790
do they even sleep?

2954
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:51,624
They don't even sleep.

2955
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:52,330
They think they like,

2956
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:53,161
like dolphins.

2957
01:20:53,161 --> 01:20:54,240
They're like partially sleep.

2958
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,910
I'd be like shut most of their
brain off for a couple hours a day.

2959
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,021
You see this video,

2960
01:20:58,021 --> 01:21:02,010
the octopus eye opening the jar to get
the food inside and then shutting the

2961
01:21:02,011 --> 01:21:02,580
jar.

2962
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:02,971
Oh yeah.

2963
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:03,720
I have seen this.

2964
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,553
Yeah.

2965
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:05,901
Have you seen the OCTA?

2966
01:21:05,901 --> 01:21:06,930
Was Jack the shark?

2967
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:07,680
No.

2968
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,040
What?

2969
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:08,341
Yeah,

2970
01:21:08,341 --> 01:21:09,690
there was another one in the aquarium.

2971
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:11,610
They're finding a lot
of sharks were missing.

2972
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,360
They're trying to figure out what
the fuck was going on and uh,

2973
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:17,090
they put a video camera up
and they saw you watched.

2974
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:18,600
That one definitely exists.

2975
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:20,850
If you look for a octopus,

2976
01:21:20,851 --> 01:21:23,410
each shark and it's fucking awkward.

2977
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:26,090
Let's just jump on the
shark and Jack theme.

2978
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:27,180
It's just Jujitsu.

2979
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,590
Once they get ahold of his body,

2980
01:21:28,591 --> 01:21:28,980
he's,

2981
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:30,480
he's helped eat them.

2982
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:30,820
Yeah.

2983
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:31,100
You know,

2984
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:31,850
it's really simple.

2985
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:32,620
Everybody thinks all do.

2986
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:33,900
Who would win and shark or an octopus?

2987
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:34,381
Oh Dude,

2988
01:21:34,381 --> 01:21:34,750
for sure.

2989
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:35,940
Shark the fuck it would.

2990
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:36,210
Right?

2991
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:37,170
It's supposed to move fast.

2992
01:21:37,171 --> 01:21:37,921
Shark is stupid.

2993
01:21:37,921 --> 01:21:38,754
They try to fight you.

2994
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:40,050
He just wrapped that bitch up,

2995
01:21:40,051 --> 01:21:40,680
watch this shit.

2996
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,520
It's kind of crazy.

2997
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:44,210
It's hard to see on this TV behind you.

2998
01:21:44,211 --> 01:21:44,370
Yeah.

2999
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:44,600
The,

3000
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:44,971
yeah.

3001
01:21:44,971 --> 01:21:45,770
There you go.

3002
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:46,603
TV buying,

3003
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:47,850
and I could look at this one back here.

3004
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:48,121
Well,

3005
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:50,040
this is act two was
just fuck the shark up,

3006
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:50,730
man.

3007
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:51,481
This shark was like,

3008
01:21:51,481 --> 01:21:52,081
yeah man,

3009
01:21:52,081 --> 01:21:52,681
I'm a shark.

3010
01:21:52,681 --> 01:21:54,180
I'm just going to fuck somebody up today.

3011
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:56,730
That shark never thought that
anyone is going to eat him.

3012
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:59,340
Sharks don't even really
have any natural predators.

3013
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:00,120
You know what I mean?

3014
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:00,391
Well,

3015
01:22:00,391 --> 01:22:01,620
the flux run around eating sharks.

3016
01:22:01,621 --> 01:22:03,480
Occasionally an Orca will kill a shark,

3017
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:06,570
but they only do it because the
sharks are too close to their babies.

3018
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,190
They're not like trying to eat him.

3019
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,150
It's pretty rare.

3020
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,200
Look at this stupid fucking shark.

3021
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:12,951
Yeah,

3022
01:22:12,951 --> 01:22:13,784
man.

3023
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:16,250
I'm just running shit down here.

3024
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,510
That's a live one right there.

3025
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:22,533
Okay,

3026
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:23,503
that's crazy.

3027
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:24,973
He's waiting.

3028
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:27,740
How long can the octopus
live outside of water?

3029
01:22:27,741 --> 01:22:29,450
That when I saw that video I was like,

3030
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:30,141
isn't he?

3031
01:22:30,141 --> 01:22:31,220
Doesn't he need water?

3032
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:31,941
I don't know,

3033
01:22:31,941 --> 01:22:34,610
but lobsters are skin live
outside a long fucking time.

3034
01:22:34,611 --> 01:22:38,290
You ever got a lobster in
the mail and they're nice.

3035
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:38,631
Yeah,

3036
01:22:38,631 --> 01:22:39,860
you can do that in the mail.

3037
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:40,730
Yeah.

3038
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:41,360
That's crazy.

3039
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:41,810
Yeah,

3040
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:42,471
and they're on ice.

3041
01:22:42,471 --> 01:22:42,741
It'll get it.

3042
01:22:42,741 --> 01:22:43,490
Here he goes,

3043
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:44,080
bitch,

3044
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:44,913
come here.

3045
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:47,180
Shark swims over the octopus.

3046
01:22:47,181 --> 01:22:50,900
The octopus just wraps this bitch
up with some like raw jujitsu.

3047
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:52,850
That's total Jujitsu,

3048
01:22:52,851 --> 01:22:53,091
bro.

3049
01:22:53,091 --> 01:22:53,924
Look at his hooks.

3050
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:54,861
Yeah,

3051
01:22:54,861 --> 01:22:55,760
he's got his back.

3052
01:22:55,761 --> 01:22:56,091
He's like,

3053
01:22:56,091 --> 01:22:56,451
oh no,

3054
01:22:56,451 --> 01:22:56,651
no,

3055
01:22:56,651 --> 01:22:56,871
no,

3056
01:22:56,871 --> 01:22:57,111
no.

3057
01:22:57,111 --> 01:22:58,100
My friend right now,

3058
01:22:58,101 --> 01:23:01,070
this is della Hiva guard
cause he's trying to get away.

3059
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:02,620
It's like our Masa.

3060
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:04,250
He's trying to bite them to the shark.

3061
01:23:04,251 --> 01:23:05,090
Might bite him a little,

3062
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:05,471
but you know,

3063
01:23:05,471 --> 01:23:06,750
here's the crazy thing about us.

3064
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,260
Or you can bite their limbs off.

3065
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:08,891
It doesn't matter.

3066
01:23:08,891 --> 01:23:10,060
Bitch growing other one,

3067
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:11,320
they grow another one.

3068
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:14,770
They're super is the super adaptable.

3069
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,090
So this shark is biting them,

3070
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:16,840
but so what?

3071
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,310
And he's just getting jacked.

3072
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,860
He's getting totally Anaconda in here.

3073
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,450
Spun around.

3074
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:23,111
Yeah,

3075
01:23:23,111 --> 01:23:25,030
there there's suction
cups are bad ass man.

3076
01:23:25,031 --> 01:23:26,380
It's a bad ass design.

3077
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:26,951
You know,

3078
01:23:26,951 --> 01:23:31,830
everything just pulls it into one center
where there's a giant fucking beak and

3079
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,640
that beat just jacks your Hass.

3080
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:34,803
Wow,

3081
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:35,920
that's cool.

3082
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:36,753
That's nature.

3083
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:37,361
Meanwhile,

3084
01:23:37,361 --> 01:23:40,840
that's crazy thing is their eyes
and our eyes are very similar.

3085
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:43,120
They're very similar biologically,

3086
01:23:43,121 --> 01:23:44,260
which is amazing.

3087
01:23:44,261 --> 01:23:44,561
Like me,

3088
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:46,270
somewhere along the line,

3089
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,460
some hundreds of millions of years ago,

3090
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:52,990
we were probably cousins of an octopus
and then we branched off into different

3091
01:23:52,991 --> 01:23:54,550
ways in the ocean floor.

3092
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:55,211
And you know,

3093
01:23:55,211 --> 01:23:55,961
we went one way,

3094
01:23:55,961 --> 01:23:56,890
they went another way.

3095
01:23:56,950 --> 01:24:00,880
They went this way of just blending in
their environment and Jack and sharks.

3096
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:03,820
And here we are jacking the world.

3097
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:04,843
Awesome.

3098
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:06,483
Um,

3099
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,230
so back to religion.

3100
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:09,280
Let's come back to it.

3101
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:09,941
Did you,

3102
01:24:09,941 --> 01:24:10,330
um,

3103
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:11,163
what did you ask?

3104
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,051
Did I ask you,

3105
01:24:12,051 --> 01:24:12,310
um,

3106
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:13,450
what was the oldest religion?

3107
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:14,021
Yeah,

3108
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:15,580
I mean I guess some form
of Fannie Mae's him.

3109
01:24:15,581 --> 01:24:16,390
He's basically,

3110
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,710
so you were telling me about the cave,

3111
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:19,210
for lack of a better term,

3112
01:24:19,211 --> 01:24:22,660
a scholar Scolito animism or shamanism
or however you want to call it.

3113
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:24,330
[inaudible] Jones.

3114
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:24,941
And they have,

3115
01:24:24,941 --> 01:24:25,630
you know,

3116
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:27,810
enormous variation from
one tribe to deny that,

3117
01:24:27,811 --> 01:24:31,630
but they have some common themes they
tend to see like the nature as alive,

3118
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:31,901
you know,

3119
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:32,681
in nature is alive.

3120
01:24:32,681 --> 01:24:36,100
We'd speed eight to spirits and everybody
seeing from threes to animals to all

3121
01:24:36,101 --> 01:24:37,000
sorts of stuff.

3122
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:37,870
Did.

3123
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:42,180
I kind of like star wars that there's a
power in everything forced to watch like

3124
01:24:42,181 --> 01:24:42,691
in a forest.

3125
01:24:42,691 --> 01:24:43,211
Exactly.

3126
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:44,560
That you cannot be in 20 times.

3127
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:44,741
No,

3128
01:24:44,741 --> 01:24:45,790
morality is not about,

3129
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:46,780
you have to be a drink first.

3130
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:47,680
Right.

3131
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,440
So there's,

3132
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,410
there's some cool stuff
out there that's uh,

3133
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:51,790
but um,

3134
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:52,121
but yeah,

3135
01:24:52,121 --> 01:24:55,690
he vats that Amanda's we from one type
to the next and it wasn't written down,

3136
01:24:55,691 --> 01:24:55,901
you know,

3137
01:24:55,901 --> 01:24:58,240
it wasn't an organized or
you joining that sense.

3138
01:24:58,241 --> 01:25:00,040
And I mean some of that's
two likes these do these day,

3139
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:00,311
you know,

3140
01:25:00,311 --> 01:25:01,330
and some tribal culture.

3141
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:02,051
It's was steel.

3142
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:02,800
What's going on?

3143
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,160
What's the official a
belief as far as like,

3144
01:25:06,161 --> 01:25:06,311
you know,

3145
01:25:06,311 --> 01:25:08,530
what's taught in schools when
it comes to cattle worship?

3146
01:25:08,531 --> 01:25:11,380
Why are there so many
cattle worshiping trials?

3147
01:25:12,030 --> 01:25:12,641
Delicious.

3148
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:12,880
Yeah,

3149
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:13,391
exactly.

3150
01:25:13,391 --> 01:25:13,930
That's,

3151
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:14,860
that's definitely true.

3152
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:19,000
That's they worshiped them as gods and
they don't even eat them in some parts of

3153
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:19,271
the world.

3154
01:25:19,271 --> 01:25:19,571
Right.

3155
01:25:19,571 --> 01:25:20,440
In the eye and stuff.

3156
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:22,330
How much does that have to
do with psychedelic drugs?

3157
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:26,660
So that's why with the theories about
Hinduism is about how a lot of it began

3158
01:25:26,661 --> 01:25:27,970
with Salma and saw him.

3159
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:30,950
I was going to see there to be some
people say was Amanita Mascara,

3160
01:25:30,951 --> 01:25:31,131
you know,

3161
01:25:31,131 --> 01:25:32,120
the marsh or Amanda,

3162
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:35,780
they say that they also say strew
Feria cubensis and they say,

3163
01:25:35,781 --> 01:25:37,010
and it might've been um,

3164
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,060
a combination,

3165
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:42,470
sort of a cocktail that they put together
right now it's amazing that if you

3166
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:43,760
know about the,

3167
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:46,880
their religion and the place
that Soma played in it,

3168
01:25:47,150 --> 01:25:48,680
that it was lost.

3169
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:50,210
Like we don't know what it is.

3170
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:50,510
Yep.

3171
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:51,290
No names.

3172
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:54,770
They would talk about Salma being greater
than all these different things and

3173
01:25:54,771 --> 01:25:55,940
Soma being amazing.

3174
01:25:55,941 --> 01:25:56,271
But yeah,

3175
01:25:56,271 --> 01:25:57,560
we don't know what Soma is.

3176
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:01,690
Somehow or another they lost with Soma
is there's that guy a garden west.

3177
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,860
And actually I think I was
in the book in there too,

3178
01:26:03,861 --> 01:26:04,040
cause

3179
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,420
it was too much of a fun story.

3180
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:05,821
Oh yeah,

3181
01:26:05,821 --> 01:26:06,070
yeah,

3182
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:06,281
yeah.

3183
01:26:06,281 --> 01:26:09,870
That chapter in title the piece drink I,

3184
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,550
how do you,

3185
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:11,530
how is it that one go

3186
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:16,830
and Watson is the one who initially made
psychedelic mushrooms popular with a

3187
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:18,040
western America.

3188
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:18,570
Oh yeah.

3189
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:22,580
I read a chapter entitled Peace Drinking
piece of drinking draggy priests

3190
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:27,150
created into Islam because it's one of
the theory that Western as about that is

3191
01:26:27,151 --> 01:26:30,750
that he believes that he believes he
was at many times carry out this summer.

3192
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,070
And the way he figured it out,

3193
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:35,490
he went through a bunch of these books
are referring to Sam and he was saying,

3194
01:26:35,491 --> 01:26:35,701
you know,

3195
01:26:35,701 --> 01:26:38,400
they keep talking about a plant
but they don't talk about leaves.

3196
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:39,360
They don't talk about,

3197
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:39,961
you know,

3198
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:41,190
they refer to stem,

3199
01:26:41,191 --> 01:26:42,470
they refer to somewhere crap.

3200
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,200
Right.

3201
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,290
And then so he was thinking he was
starting to go into mushroom direction and

3202
01:26:46,291 --> 01:26:49,810
then he finds out this piece of literature
or from somewhere else where it's

3203
01:26:49,811 --> 01:26:54,811
some Shyman in Siberia I think was
talking about how they feel terror Amanita

3204
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:57,950
Muscarella and he had read
about these three pl field.

3205
01:26:57,951 --> 01:26:59,670
Third are they using for some hour?

3206
01:26:59,671 --> 01:27:01,480
They do a couple of sinks to better wait.

3207
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:03,270
And then there's a human
filter and he was like,

3208
01:27:03,271 --> 01:27:04,650
what the hell is a human filter?

3209
01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:08,470
He find out that if you
take Amanita Mascara,

3210
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,680
you'll get the high by yours.

3211
01:27:09,681 --> 01:27:10,880
So guy the really nauseous and

3212
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,350
in your purse or your drink,

3213
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:16,850
somebody else getting the high,

3214
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,820
but they get stuck with a crappy part.

3215
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:21,830
They get all the side effects.

3216
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:22,960
Your dog.

3217
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:23,151
Well,

3218
01:27:23,151 --> 01:27:27,140
I know that people drink their own
parents when they're tripping it take an

3219
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:31,640
Amnio or when they're taking an fairy
cubensis they'll drink their own urine and

3220
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:33,080
they blast off.

3221
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:34,730
Apparently I talked to this dude,

3222
01:27:34,731 --> 01:27:35,031
he was like,

3223
01:27:35,031 --> 01:27:35,331
I was like,

3224
01:27:35,331 --> 01:27:36,290
I don't want to drink my piss.

3225
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:36,951
This is crazy.

3226
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:37,401
And was like,

3227
01:27:37,401 --> 01:27:37,641
dude,

3228
01:27:37,641 --> 01:27:37,941
trust me.

3229
01:27:37,941 --> 01:27:38,774
Drink your like,

3230
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:39,120
he's like,

3231
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:42,410
I'm tripping balls and they're telling
me I need to drink my piss to get higher

3232
01:27:42,411 --> 01:27:42,741
than this.

3233
01:27:42,741 --> 01:27:42,951
He goes,

3234
01:27:42,951 --> 01:27:44,000
I don't want to get out in this,

3235
01:27:44,001 --> 01:27:44,834
like trust me.

3236
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:45,411
And he goes,

3237
01:27:45,411 --> 01:27:46,190
okay.

3238
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:46,611
And he goes,

3239
01:27:46,611 --> 01:27:47,600
I drink my piss.

3240
01:27:47,601 --> 01:27:52,520
And he goes and all of a sudden it was
like a tornado opened up in front of my

3241
01:27:52,521 --> 01:27:57,521
eyes and I got sucked through the center
of it and said it was the craziest trip

3242
01:27:58,851 --> 01:28:00,560
and the most enlightening
trooper was life.

3243
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:01,401
But yeah,

3244
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:01,650
it,

3245
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:02,190
yeah,

3246
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:05,810
that's at least is your own in these
cases even closer because it's somebody

3247
01:28:05,811 --> 01:28:06,191
else's,

3248
01:28:06,191 --> 01:28:08,510
it just cause you don't want
to get the side effects.

3249
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:13,510
But I may or may not have watched people
drank animals pis who I may or may not.

3250
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:14,480
If I can't discuss money,

3251
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:15,140
she paid for that.

3252
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:17,210
I can't discuss this until now.

3253
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:18,140
It was in person.

3254
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:18,980
I didn't pay anything.

3255
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:19,853
I actually got paid,

3256
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,170
but it might not really be real.

3257
01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:21,630
Uh,

3258
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:21,910
I can,

3259
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:25,440
and I can't discuss this till uh,

3260
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:29,120
ironically and a totally unrelated
after fear factor starts hearing.

3261
01:28:29,121 --> 01:28:29,954
Which Harrison?

3262
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:31,720
Cool.

3263
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:32,553
Well,

3264
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:34,080
um,

3265
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,510
the human filter was a popular thing.

3266
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:37,500
People would just sell their own.

3267
01:28:37,530 --> 01:28:40,020
Would they sell it where
they just make a deal?

3268
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:40,790
I'll tell you what,

3269
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:45,000
like why line in some 40,000 year old
book or something so nobody really knows.

3270
01:28:45,001 --> 01:28:46,070
And he could be the west.

3271
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,150
He speculating going off
the deep end with that.

3272
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:48,930
Could be,

3273
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:49,890
but it's an interesting,

3274
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,240
it's a fan theory if nothing else.

3275
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:55,450
How many do Mascara is a very strange
mushroom because they believe it's not

3276
01:28:55,451 --> 01:28:56,830
only variable genetically,

3277
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,320
but it's variable by location seasonally.

3278
01:28:59,321 --> 01:29:02,430
And that some of them might
not even be psychoactive.

3279
01:29:02,431 --> 01:29:04,230
There's some of them might not even work.

3280
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:04,560
Right.

3281
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:04,900
You know,

3282
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:05,280
I've,

3283
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,430
I've tried am Anita and
to when nothing happened,

3284
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:08,671
right.

3285
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:08,971
You know,

3286
01:29:08,971 --> 01:29:09,721
I tried to,

3287
01:29:09,721 --> 01:29:10,554
I didn't,

3288
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:11,641
I went on a,

3289
01:29:11,641 --> 01:29:13,680
a combat atory experience.

3290
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:14,680
We tried the Amanita,

3291
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,500
we tried it for a few
hours and nothing took.

3292
01:29:16,501 --> 01:29:19,290
So then we took some regular
mushrooms and then we blast it off.

3293
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,590
So it was a combination of the
two of them was like ultra potent.

3294
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:24,270
The emoney that did something weird,

3295
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:27,180
but it wasn't really like getting you off.

3296
01:29:27,181 --> 01:29:29,910
It was just like getting you
to this weird head space.

3297
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:30,190
I was like,

3298
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:30,480
Whoa,

3299
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,320
what's going on here?

3300
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:32,201
Like is this,

3301
01:29:32,201 --> 01:29:33,570
this is what this stuff is like.

3302
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:35,370
I just think it wasn't strong enough.

3303
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:36,181
It wasn't good enough.

3304
01:29:36,181 --> 01:29:36,691
And I think,

3305
01:29:36,691 --> 01:29:37,080
um,

3306
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:37,381
you know,

3307
01:29:37,381 --> 01:29:39,030
there's parts of the
world where it's like,

3308
01:29:39,370 --> 01:29:39,670
Eh,

3309
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:40,503
you know,

3310
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:44,130
where they really know how to do it
and we'll really in Siberia special ed.

3311
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,600
And it's fascinating.

3312
01:29:45,601 --> 01:29:49,740
This thing about Siberia is how the
Amanita Mascara mushroom is essentially

3313
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:50,310
Christmas.

3314
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:51,540
It's essentially Santa Claus.

3315
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:53,660
When people don't know that the,

3316
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:58,080
the Christmas theme and the mushroom
theme are so closely related,

3317
01:29:58,230 --> 01:29:59,430
they're eating the same color,

3318
01:29:59,490 --> 01:29:59,721
right?

3319
01:29:59,721 --> 01:30:01,860
How many Anita must grow
mushroom is Santa Claus.

3320
01:30:01,861 --> 01:30:02,790
It's red,

3321
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,600
you know,

3322
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:08,600
and it has a Michael Rise relationship
with a certain coniferous trees so that

3323
01:30:09,091 --> 01:30:11,130
it grows only under those trees,

3324
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:14,370
just like packages under
your fucking Christmas tree.

3325
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:15,070
I mean,

3326
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:16,260
it's really amazing.

3327
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:16,741
I mean,

3328
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:17,401
and you know,

3329
01:30:17,401 --> 01:30:20,340
and people would gather them and the
way to drive them out was they would put

3330
01:30:20,341 --> 01:30:21,810
them on the fucking trees,

3331
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:23,260
on the branches of the trees.

3332
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:24,300
So the son would get them,

3333
01:30:24,301 --> 01:30:25,140
it would dry them out.

3334
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:26,130
Like it's like,

3335
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,810
that's the ornaments on the trees.

3336
01:30:27,811 --> 01:30:29,040
It's like all of it is there.

3337
01:30:29,041 --> 01:30:32,760
It's like there's so many connections
and it's been argued that,

3338
01:30:32,761 --> 01:30:33,000
uh,

3339
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:33,271
you know,

3340
01:30:33,271 --> 01:30:36,540
someone told me the Coca Cola was the
first one to actually make a red and white

3341
01:30:36,541 --> 01:30:37,081
Santa Claus.

3342
01:30:37,081 --> 01:30:38,460
Then he was a different color before then.

3343
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,660
But that's not really true.

3344
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:40,310
Um,

3345
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:40,820
there's,

3346
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:43,950
there's evidence of red and
white Sanchez from long time ago,

3347
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,661
you know,

3348
01:30:44,661 --> 01:30:44,881
and,

3349
01:30:44,881 --> 01:30:46,380
but that the Santa doesn't even matter.

3350
01:30:46,381 --> 01:30:49,470
What really matters is the fucking
presents under the tree the way you know,

3351
01:30:49,471 --> 01:30:49,711
the,

3352
01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:51,480
the relationship that
it has with the tree.

3353
01:30:51,481 --> 01:30:54,990
The reason why we have Christmas trees
and they're always fucking pine trees,

3354
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:55,590
man.

3355
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:55,801
I mean,

3356
01:30:55,801 --> 01:30:56,251
the whole thing,

3357
01:30:56,251 --> 01:30:56,551
it's like,

3358
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:57,041
wow,

3359
01:30:57,041 --> 01:30:57,230
it's,

3360
01:30:57,230 --> 01:30:59,310
there's the relationship's so close,

3361
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:00,210
the look,

3362
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:01,200
the color of it,

3363
01:31:01,201 --> 01:31:05,490
and the fact that we hang stockings over
the fireplace and those stockings when

3364
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:08,820
the fuck did you ever get a pair of
red and white stockings that you wore?

3365
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:09,440
Right.

3366
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,880
You don't button through that tool,

3367
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,230
but that's also how they dry
mushrooms out of their home.

3368
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,170
They hang them in front of the fireplace
and that's what drives them out.

3369
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:17,600
I would say

3370
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:23,290
it's an incredible like series of,

3371
01:31:23,291 --> 01:31:24,124
uh,

3372
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:25,281
whether they're,

3373
01:31:25,281 --> 01:31:26,880
they're co coincidences or,

3374
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:27,211
I mean,

3375
01:31:27,211 --> 01:31:28,110
I wouldn't say coincidence.

3376
01:31:28,111 --> 01:31:28,681
I would say,

3377
01:31:28,681 --> 01:31:28,891
you know,

3378
01:31:28,891 --> 01:31:29,131
there's,

3379
01:31:29,131 --> 01:31:31,550
there's evidence that
there's a relationship and a,

3380
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,060
there's a bunch of people
that have studied this.

3381
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:37,200
There's a guy a and Andrew
Ruta g and a young urban,

3382
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:37,501
they've,

3383
01:31:37,501 --> 01:31:39,240
they've done a lot of study on this stuff.

3384
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:40,133
And the,

3385
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:40,741
and the great,

3386
01:31:40,741 --> 01:31:45,090
Jack Herer was actually writing a book
about this before he died though the

3387
01:31:45,091 --> 01:31:48,810
relationship with Christianity
and a mushrooms as well.

3388
01:31:48,811 --> 01:31:53,811
He had all these really cool ancient
paintings of people who are naked dancing

3389
01:31:55,171 --> 01:31:57,750
and the ecstasy under the very clear,

3390
01:31:57,751 --> 01:32:00,280
transparent silhouette
of a shape of a mushroom,

3391
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:01,211
you know,

3392
01:32:01,211 --> 01:32:02,670
so it's really amazing stuff.

3393
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:04,030
Like the idea,

3394
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:08,470
and if you ever look at the really old
pictures of Halos that's as fascinating

3395
01:32:08,471 --> 01:32:09,690
to old Halos,

3396
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:13,330
like the new halos or like a Frisbee
or like a hula hoop proud and floating

3397
01:32:13,331 --> 01:32:14,260
around the back of your head.

3398
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:15,580
But the old Halos,

3399
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:18,520
we're literally on the
underside of a mushroom cap.

3400
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:19,773
Oh yeah,

3401
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:20,420
yeah,

3402
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:20,740
yeah.

3403
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:22,940
And it has the straw
that little lines in it,

3404
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:24,100
just like a mushroom does.

3405
01:32:24,101 --> 01:32:24,640
And it's,

3406
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,530
it's really a trip when
you see that you go,

3407
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:27,341
oh my God.

3408
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:31,570
Like this is what they were saying was
these people were under the spell of the

3409
01:32:31,571 --> 01:32:31,841
mushroom.

3410
01:32:31,841 --> 01:32:32,770
They were enlightened,

3411
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:33,100
right.

3412
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:34,630
Because they were under
the spell of the mushroom.

3413
01:32:34,631 --> 01:32:35,020
Right.

3414
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:36,700
And there's mushrooms symbology,

3415
01:32:36,701 --> 01:32:41,701
like all throughout ancient buildings
and like doorways or mushroom shaped like

3416
01:32:42,161 --> 01:32:42,870
literally these,

3417
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:43,270
these,

3418
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:45,610
these temples had mushroom shaped doorway.

3419
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:46,270
Right.

3420
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:47,170
Fuck man.

3421
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:49,660
How many people were
on mushrooms back then?

3422
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:51,030
No,

3423
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:51,900
no Internet.

3424
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:52,773
No TV.

3425
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:55,020
You got to keep entertained somehow.

3426
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:55,921
Yeah.

3427
01:32:55,921 --> 01:32:56,551
That's the move,

3428
01:32:56,551 --> 01:32:56,990
right?

3429
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:57,420
Yeah.

3430
01:32:57,420 --> 01:32:58,253
Damn man.

3431
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:00,150
So when you're teaching these classes,

3432
01:33:00,151 --> 01:33:02,040
do you ever get anybody
who's angry at you?

3433
01:33:02,190 --> 01:33:05,790
Do you ever get anybody who wants to
talk to you after class and just like,

3434
01:33:05,791 --> 01:33:06,061
you know,

3435
01:33:06,061 --> 01:33:06,320
hey,

3436
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,730
what you're doing is wrong or,

3437
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:08,090
no,

3438
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:09,800
for the most part airmail I mean,

3439
01:33:09,801 --> 01:33:10,221
and again,

3440
01:33:10,221 --> 01:33:13,700
I tried to do it in a way that I try
not to be offensive to the individual.

3441
01:33:13,701 --> 01:33:14,870
I may say something harsh.

3442
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:17,690
I always say something
harsh about the big picture,

3443
01:33:17,691 --> 01:33:18,770
but on the,

3444
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:20,150
on an individual lab and he's like,

3445
01:33:20,151 --> 01:33:20,451
hey man,

3446
01:33:20,451 --> 01:33:20,691
I mean,

3447
01:33:20,691 --> 01:33:21,710
it doesn't mean I hate you.

3448
01:33:21,711 --> 01:33:21,931
You know?

3449
01:33:21,931 --> 01:33:22,790
It's like we're playing here,

3450
01:33:22,791 --> 01:33:23,630
we're tossing ideas.

3451
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:25,070
I'm not attached to my ideas.

3452
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,540
That would be something that makes sense.

3453
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:27,470
I'll change my mind right now.

3454
01:33:27,471 --> 01:33:28,304
You're always like,

3455
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:29,900
I'm not here to defend an ideology.

3456
01:33:29,901 --> 01:33:30,681
So it would have been okay,

3457
01:33:30,681 --> 01:33:30,940
ours,

3458
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:31,773
we're just playing,

3459
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:32,510
you know,

3460
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:33,920
so people in my little out and once,

3461
01:33:33,921 --> 01:33:34,071
you know,

3462
01:33:34,071 --> 01:33:35,480
why do we have discussions?

3463
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:37,700
I had a Muslim student
who was very nice guy,

3464
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:40,250
but obviously wasn't too keen.

3465
01:33:40,251 --> 01:33:42,500
He loved me when I talk
shit about other religious,

3466
01:33:42,501 --> 01:33:43,910
but of course he had to sub each.

3467
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:46,320
That's what I started
picking on the Quran.

3468
01:33:47,150 --> 01:33:48,020
He had these,

3469
01:33:48,021 --> 01:33:48,854
um,

3470
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:51,680
one thing I pick it on was
this passage in the Koran,

3471
01:33:51,681 --> 01:33:56,681
the basically justify beating up your
wife if she's disobedient and uh,

3472
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:58,220
he's a nice guy,

3473
01:33:58,221 --> 01:34:00,290
so he doesn't really want to support that.

3474
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,480
But at the same time he doesn't
want to go it against the Koran.

3475
01:34:02,481 --> 01:34:05,030
So he was like struggling and trying
to figure out what do I do with it?

3476
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:08,060
He kept up with this weird
ass theory a week later,

3477
01:34:08,061 --> 01:34:08,461
tell him,

3478
01:34:08,461 --> 01:34:09,294
you know what?

3479
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:12,140
This is God telling you that
you shouldn't beat up women.

3480
01:34:12,141 --> 01:34:12,950
And I'm like,

3481
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:13,131
yeah,

3482
01:34:13,131 --> 01:34:13,581
that's the way it,

3483
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:17,030
except that it's saying
that you should [inaudible].

3484
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:18,111
She's like,

3485
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:18,261
no,

3486
01:34:18,261 --> 01:34:18,381
no.

3487
01:34:18,381 --> 01:34:20,060
He's using saboteurs psychology.

3488
01:34:20,061 --> 01:34:20,301
You know,

3489
01:34:20,301 --> 01:34:21,020
because he's,

3490
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:22,280
if he tells you not to,

3491
01:34:22,281 --> 01:34:23,061
then you get pieces,

3492
01:34:23,061 --> 01:34:23,930
then you want to do it.

3493
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,033
So firstly,

3494
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:26,090
wait,

3495
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:29,870
he said first Firstie Thal seal
that you should talk to them.

3496
01:34:29,871 --> 01:34:32,050
And then if they don't marry forum,

3497
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:36,200
then you banish them to another
room and not only as a last resort,

3498
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:37,140
then you can beat them.

3499
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:38,630
So really styling,

3500
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:38,841
you know,

3501
01:34:38,841 --> 01:34:39,870
you shouldn't be the map,

3502
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,350
but it's doing it in a smart way.

3503
01:34:41,351 --> 01:34:42,184
And I was like,

3504
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:43,231
oh my fucking God,

3505
01:34:43,231 --> 01:34:43,550
I it,

3506
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:44,780
can you just take them?

3507
01:34:44,781 --> 01:34:46,820
Maybe there's some good stuff
in the Koran and your cat,

3508
01:34:46,821 --> 01:34:47,421
some crap.

3509
01:34:47,421 --> 01:34:50,530
And can we engineer
the most dogmatic slums

3510
01:34:50,530 --> 01:34:52,930
like radical Muslims are
the most dogmatic about it.

3511
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:55,360
What do you find to be
the most ridiculous?

3512
01:34:55,361 --> 01:34:56,890
Is there are they are religions,

3513
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:58,243
ridiculous.

3514
01:34:59,310 --> 01:35:00,350
The people,

3515
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:04,070
all the ones who believe that there's
only one right way that has been revealed

3516
01:35:04,071 --> 01:35:05,330
by God to damn.

3517
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:08,340
And so they are super
hardcore to the magic.

3518
01:35:08,350 --> 01:35:08,901
And mostly,

3519
01:35:08,901 --> 01:35:12,260
I mean you're talking about Muslim
fundamentalists today in particular,

3520
01:35:12,261 --> 01:35:12,651
Mazda,

3521
01:35:12,651 --> 01:35:15,180
fundamentalist Christian
fundamentalists throughout metro fees.

3522
01:35:15,181 --> 01:35:16,760
Three they mellowed out a lethal today.

3523
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:17,930
They let you paint them.

3524
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:18,240
Yeah,

3525
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:18,651
exactly.

3526
01:35:18,651 --> 01:35:19,484
Draw Jesus.

3527
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:21,320
Mohammad a fucking shoot.

3528
01:35:21,321 --> 01:35:22,340
You blow your house up.

3529
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,571
But uh,

3530
01:35:23,571 --> 01:35:27,470
I think he's only in
western Western monotheistic
religions have the tendency to

3531
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:27,730
have,

3532
01:35:27,730 --> 01:35:28,330
uh,

3533
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:31,110
an alt s more Arad bead die.

3534
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:33,470
It'll kill you if you
disagree kind of mentality.

3535
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:35,240
Monster Asian seeing so,

3536
01:35:35,241 --> 01:35:35,391
I mean,

3537
01:35:35,391 --> 01:35:35,961
you can agree,

3538
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:36,771
you can disagree,

3539
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:37,730
but they are kind of like,

3540
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,150
Eh,

3541
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:38,480
you know,

3542
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,100
if you disagree with the hell cares,

3543
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:41,660
it's the years thing.

3544
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:42,570
Yeah.

3545
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:45,260
Asian martial arts or
Asian rather illusions.

3546
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:45,981
What about,

3547
01:35:45,981 --> 01:35:46,814
um,

3548
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:47,781
what do they got?

3549
01:35:47,781 --> 01:35:52,781
The idea that the most dogmatic and the
most restrictive religions are really

3550
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:58,310
the religions that have come from
the areas that have like the oldest

3551
01:35:58,311 --> 01:35:59,180
civilizations.

3552
01:35:59,210 --> 01:35:59,690
Right.

3553
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:00,830
And so almost like,

3554
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:01,251
you know,

3555
01:36:01,251 --> 01:36:01,670
like,

3556
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:02,510
like sue mayor,

3557
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:04,220
which is where I rack is,

3558
01:36:04,221 --> 01:36:04,470
right.

3559
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:04,850
You know,

3560
01:36:04,850 --> 01:36:09,850
really famously is a part of the
world that is still in the dark ages.

3561
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:11,210
Right.

3562
01:36:11,210 --> 01:36:12,043
And a lot of ways,

3563
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:12,650
you know,

3564
01:36:12,650 --> 01:36:12,951
the,

3565
01:36:12,951 --> 01:36:13,141
the,

3566
01:36:13,141 --> 01:36:16,040
the battles we're seeing the
Sunni and the Shiites and the,

3567
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:16,670
just the,

3568
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:17,300
the,

3569
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:19,820
the Kurds and all the shit that
happened with Saddam Hussein and,

3570
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:20,180
right.

3571
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:21,560
And you go back to that area.

3572
01:36:21,561 --> 01:36:21,951
I mean you,

3573
01:36:21,951 --> 01:36:22,551
you say,

3574
01:36:22,551 --> 01:36:23,090
well,

3575
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:23,601
you know this,

3576
01:36:23,601 --> 01:36:25,910
this area literally was sue mare.

3577
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:26,421
This is,

3578
01:36:26,421 --> 01:36:27,440
there is Babylon.

3579
01:36:27,441 --> 01:36:28,274
This is where,

3580
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:28,730
you know,

3581
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:28,901
the,

3582
01:36:28,901 --> 01:36:29,181
the,

3583
01:36:29,181 --> 01:36:32,720
literally the first religions
were created as far as we know.

3584
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:33,201
You know,

3585
01:36:33,201 --> 01:36:34,880
and when you think about that,

3586
01:36:34,881 --> 01:36:36,500
like the people that are still there,

3587
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:39,140
they're much more influenced by the deep,

3588
01:36:39,141 --> 01:36:40,100
deep past,

3589
01:36:40,290 --> 01:36:40,880
you know,

3590
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:44,720
then people that have spread out to
all parts of the world as travelers,

3591
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:46,070
especially Americans.

3592
01:36:46,071 --> 01:36:46,301
Right.

3593
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:46,850
That's the,

3594
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:47,510
the further,

3595
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:50,870
the last example of a new
continent that we know that,

3596
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:51,230
you know,

3597
01:36:51,230 --> 01:36:53,930
just over the last few hundred
years it's been established.

3598
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:54,471
Yeah.

3599
01:36:54,471 --> 01:36:56,840
I'm kind of scared of anything
that comes out of the desert.

3600
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:58,220
The desert is a it up place.

3601
01:36:58,221 --> 01:36:59,840
I mean it's just some
people do well in it,

3602
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:01,250
but for the most part it's harsh.

3603
01:37:01,251 --> 01:37:02,330
Environment matters,

3604
01:37:02,331 --> 01:37:02,571
man.

3605
01:37:02,571 --> 01:37:02,691
Oh,

3606
01:37:02,691 --> 01:37:05,590
do you want to do is you just
squeezed between two rocks but Ada,

3607
01:37:05,610 --> 01:37:06,500
your brain,

3608
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:08,060
does it start oozing out of your hand?

3609
01:37:08,910 --> 01:37:12,680
[inaudible] so it's like all
religions that come out of the desert.

3610
01:37:12,681 --> 01:37:17,290
I can see how the people that come out
of the desert ridge drive from California

3611
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:22,510
to the drive from California to Vegas
and he'd get out and you just smell crime

3612
01:37:23,031 --> 01:37:23,600
dude.

3613
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,310
Smell fear and anger.

3614
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:26,440
Fear and loathing.

3615
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:26,840
Right,

3616
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:27,673
exactly.

3617
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,840
At Arrest Thompson fucking nailed it.

3618
01:37:29,841 --> 01:37:30,440
I mean,

3619
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:35,440
it's not a mistake that he drove in a
convertible taking it all in while on

3620
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:37,093
ether.

3621
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:39,440
I come that,

3622
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:39,980
yeah,

3623
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,570
that's probably the way
to see it correctly.

3624
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:42,480
No,

3625
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:43,880
so that's with the religions.

3626
01:37:43,881 --> 01:37:44,960
I mean really jumped,

3627
01:37:44,961 --> 01:37:47,720
come out from beautiful
mountains and reverse and shit.

3628
01:37:47,721 --> 01:37:51,590
I'm sure he's going to do something to
its ideology where they are maybe not old

3629
01:37:51,591 --> 01:37:51,801
ways,

3630
01:37:51,801 --> 01:37:53,060
but for more likely than not,

3631
01:37:53,061 --> 01:37:55,290
they're going to have a
more mellow view of life.

3632
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:55,471
Well,

3633
01:37:55,471 --> 01:37:57,180
there's only one really mellow religion,

3634
01:37:57,181 --> 01:37:57,400
right?

3635
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:59,670
That's Buddhism led these
amazing perky model.

3636
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:00,150
In fact,

3637
01:38:00,150 --> 01:38:01,620
I have no problems with,

3638
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:02,940
I mean Sam bags.

3639
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:03,601
I can do that.

3640
01:38:03,601 --> 01:38:03,721
Good.

3641
01:38:03,721 --> 01:38:04,950
He read some stuff in Buddhism,

3642
01:38:04,951 --> 01:38:07,220
but is it's pleasant disagreement,

3643
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:07,411
you know,

3644
01:38:07,411 --> 01:38:07,921
it's like,

3645
01:38:07,921 --> 01:38:09,780
and they are not as a,

3646
01:38:09,781 --> 01:38:10,890
at least for the most part,

3647
01:38:10,891 --> 01:38:14,460
as our core trying to shove it down your
throat so it's a little more relaxed to

3648
01:38:14,461 --> 01:38:17,070
have a dialogue that's
really appreciate that.

3649
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:19,560
I really appreciate religions
that don't proselytize.

3650
01:38:19,561 --> 01:38:20,371
I really appreciate it.

3651
01:38:20,371 --> 01:38:21,210
Like two days.

3652
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:21,750
I'm like,

3653
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:22,980
nobody's trying to get you to be a Jew.

3654
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:23,191
Right,

3655
01:38:23,191 --> 01:38:23,311
right,

3656
01:38:23,311 --> 01:38:23,491
right,

3657
01:38:23,491 --> 01:38:24,324
right.

3658
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:25,790
Yeah.

3659
01:38:25,790 --> 01:38:27,150
And you really can't even join,

3660
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:27,361
you know,

3661
01:38:27,361 --> 01:38:28,410
it's really hard to join,

3662
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,010
right?

3663
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:29,370
Yeah.

3664
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:30,390
You've got to marry some chick.

3665
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:31,853
You know,

3666
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:32,041
it's,

3667
01:38:32,041 --> 01:38:32,770
my uncle did,

3668
01:38:32,770 --> 01:38:35,450
my uncle converted name
is Salvatore Digerlando.

3669
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:38,790
He could really became Jewish.

3670
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,170
Um,

3671
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:40,800
yeah.

3672
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,071
It's,

3673
01:38:41,071 --> 01:38:41,460
um,

3674
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:42,750
it's interesting to me that,

3675
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:43,440
you know,

3676
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,520
there's no,

3677
01:38:44,521 --> 01:38:45,180
uh,

3678
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:45,810
there's,

3679
01:38:45,810 --> 01:38:46,643
there's no,

3680
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:48,960
I wouldn't say there's no new religions,

3681
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:52,170
but there's no new respected religions.

3682
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:54,960
There's everything where you
can look back and feel like,

3683
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:55,710
you know,

3684
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:57,570
some people take Scientology seriously,

3685
01:38:57,870 --> 01:39:00,180
but for the most part it
seems to be just a group.

3686
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:00,650
You know what I mean?

3687
01:39:00,650 --> 01:39:01,740
You can call it a religion,

3688
01:39:01,741 --> 01:39:04,740
but no one in that really is believe,

3689
01:39:04,770 --> 01:39:09,180
at least I don't think they are believing
the stories of Scientology the same

3690
01:39:09,181 --> 01:39:10,830
way that people are
believing that ridiculous.

3691
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:11,071
I mean,

3692
01:39:11,071 --> 01:39:13,290
especially when it's written
by a science fiction author,

3693
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:14,640
but because we know motor shit today,

3694
01:39:14,641 --> 01:39:14,831
you know,

3695
01:39:14,831 --> 01:39:18,120
it's like you can make some great
claims about some of these 10 past where

3696
01:39:18,121 --> 01:39:19,020
nobody knows shit.

3697
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:19,681
Then it's,

3698
01:39:19,681 --> 01:39:22,500
you can spin a story that
nobody can disprove today.

3699
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:23,761
Uh,

3700
01:39:23,761 --> 01:39:24,001
you know,

3701
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:26,520
in three seconds people find out
all about you where they are like,

3702
01:39:26,521 --> 01:39:26,970
hey,

3703
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:27,631
either the,

3704
01:39:27,631 --> 01:39:28,291
your profit,

3705
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:31,950
the guy who was like ranting some
child porn the other day and he's like,

3706
01:39:31,951 --> 01:39:32,731
what are you talking about it?

3707
01:39:32,731 --> 01:39:35,260
So it's a little harder
to get away with stuff.

3708
01:39:35,290 --> 01:39:36,220
And you remember the uh,

3709
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:40,500
Ted Haggard documentary that
Hbo and one of the things,

3710
01:39:40,501 --> 01:39:43,860
he goes to look for a job and
after he gets out and goes,

3711
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:44,341
oh,

3712
01:39:44,341 --> 01:39:45,121
I think I'll be okay.

3713
01:39:45,121 --> 01:39:46,110
Unless they Google me,

3714
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:47,400
I had said,

3715
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:47,761
he said,

3716
01:39:47,761 --> 01:39:49,200
I think I'll be okay.

3717
01:39:49,201 --> 01:39:50,910
I'll get the job unless they Google me.

3718
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:51,660
It's great.

3719
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:52,411
It's Hilarious,

3720
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:52,890
man.

3721
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:53,723
That's hilarious.

3722
01:39:54,090 --> 01:39:55,560
He's back to teaching again.

3723
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,240
He's got a church now.

3724
01:39:57,270 --> 01:40:01,590
Let your love it does guys are so
hardcore about morality and this and that.

3725
01:40:01,591 --> 01:40:03,870
And they thought that they
mellow out a little bit,

3726
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:04,890
which would be healthy.

3727
01:40:04,891 --> 01:40:05,101
No,

3728
01:40:05,101 --> 01:40:06,330
they go all like,

3729
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:09,090
I'll do methamphetamine
with the gay hooker.

3730
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:10,910
That's one yard.

3731
01:40:10,911 --> 01:40:13,950
The wine was ugly in that
masturbation is the altity mets scene.

3732
01:40:13,951 --> 01:40:15,350
And it's like Jesus said haggard.

3733
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,410
He blocked me on Twitter.

3734
01:40:16,570 --> 01:40:17,250
Yeah,

3735
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:17,820
he did.

3736
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:18,870
I made a joke.

3737
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:22,830
He was talking about church
is like after church may be,

3738
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:23,221
uh,

3739
01:40:23,221 --> 01:40:23,521
you know,

3740
01:40:23,521 --> 01:40:26,130
sandwiches and a picnic and then dot,

3741
01:40:26,131 --> 01:40:26,401
dot.

3742
01:40:26,401 --> 01:40:27,150
Dot.

3743
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:28,730
And I wrote math and blowjob.

3744
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:30,860
Yeah.

3745
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:31,640
I mean,

3746
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,420
but he's even by [inaudible].

3747
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:34,313
Come on,

3748
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:35,461
man.

3749
01:40:35,461 --> 01:40:35,851
You can't just,

3750
01:40:35,851 --> 01:40:36,730
we'll leave that out there.

3751
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:38,603
He blocked me,

3752
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:39,451
blocked me on Twitter.

3753
01:40:39,451 --> 01:40:40,284
The fuck.

3754
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:41,730
I block people too,

3755
01:40:41,731 --> 01:40:42,630
but only when they're assholes.

3756
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:44,160
If you say something that funny,

3757
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:44,851
but you know,

3758
01:40:44,851 --> 01:40:49,260
some people that have got no sense of
humor priest to get busted with gay

3759
01:40:49,261 --> 01:40:50,460
hookers and math,

3760
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:51,960
the rarely can they laugh at it.

3761
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:52,231
No,

3762
01:40:52,231 --> 01:40:53,064
unfortunately.

3763
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:54,251
Unfortunately.

3764
01:40:54,251 --> 01:40:55,084
Yeah.

3765
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,940
So mostly the most unreal,

3766
01:40:57,970 --> 01:41:00,640
reasonable religion
would have to be Islam.

3767
01:41:00,670 --> 01:41:01,040
Right.

3768
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,140
They're the most,

3769
01:41:02,610 --> 01:41:03,400
they if you don't,

3770
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,020
I mean you can't make fun of them.

3771
01:41:05,021 --> 01:41:05,600
You can't,

3772
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,570
today's pretty tough to do,

3773
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:07,841
you know,

3774
01:41:07,841 --> 01:41:10,600
that woman that had to go into
hiding and they had changed her name.

3775
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:11,110
Um,

3776
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:11,520
she,

3777
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:11,860
uh,

3778
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:12,191
was a,

3779
01:41:12,191 --> 01:41:13,570
a calmness and she,

3780
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:18,390
she wanted to have a drama
Hammad Monday and uh,

3781
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:21,130
she had so many threats
against her life value.

3782
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:21,710
Yeah.

3783
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:22,750
They were really,

3784
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:23,643
they will kill you.

3785
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:24,730
Isn't that amazing?

3786
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:26,830
It's amazing that that's tolerated.

3787
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:28,060
Like that's some bullshit,

3788
01:41:28,110 --> 01:41:28,390
but yeah.

3789
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:29,650
You need to fucking relax.

3790
01:41:29,651 --> 01:41:29,771
Yeah.

3791
01:41:29,771 --> 01:41:30,780
One thing that trips me out,

3792
01:41:30,781 --> 01:41:34,090
what is the reaction like when they
wear the Mohammad cartoons are nowhere,

3793
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:38,590
even salamander actually back in the
day at branch of the Western world where

3794
01:41:38,591 --> 01:41:38,921
saying,

3795
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:39,161
yeah,

3796
01:41:39,161 --> 01:41:39,501
sure,

3797
01:41:39,501 --> 01:41:41,020
de violence is bad.

3798
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:45,340
The Muslim reaction by
release this terrible and the
fence if what these people

3799
01:41:45,341 --> 01:41:45,851
are doing.

3800
01:41:45,851 --> 01:41:46,684
And I'm just like,

3801
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:47,590
are you kidding me?

3802
01:41:47,591 --> 01:41:47,801
You know,

3803
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:50,910
you're giving into
burners and arguing that,

3804
01:41:50,911 --> 01:41:51,260
uh,

3805
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:52,600
exactly what we want to squash,

3806
01:41:52,601 --> 01:41:53,650
freedom of opinion.

3807
01:41:53,651 --> 01:41:54,484
That's a,

3808
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:56,320
in the name of respecting religion.

3809
01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:58,100
If you want to go to war,

3810
01:41:58,101 --> 01:41:59,430
if United States wants to go to war,

3811
01:41:59,431 --> 01:42:02,770
should go to war with anybody that wants
to kill a lady who suggests that you

3812
01:42:02,771 --> 01:42:04,320
should have a drama Hammad Monday,

3813
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:05,680
that's who she had a war with.

3814
01:42:05,681 --> 01:42:06,160
Terrorism.

3815
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:07,090
Go to war with them.

3816
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:09,880
Have people that pretend
to do shit like that.

3817
01:42:09,881 --> 01:42:12,370
Find out who's ready to kill
them and then go get them.

3818
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:13,750
Go get them boys.

3819
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:14,440
You know those,

3820
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:14,711
those,

3821
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:15,880
the jackasses in the world.

3822
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:20,080
Those are the people who you can't bounce
that bar that far back from where they

3823
01:42:20,081 --> 01:42:20,260
are.

3824
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:24,430
They need to die and come back and live
life again and try to learn from this

3825
01:42:24,431 --> 01:42:28,240
life's experiences because there you're
not going to bounce back from being a

3826
01:42:28,241 --> 01:42:32,320
guy who is willing to cut the heart out
of a woman who wanted to have a drama

3827
01:42:32,321 --> 01:42:33,520
Hammad Monday you,

3828
01:42:33,521 --> 01:42:36,160
that guy's never going to be a
productive member of society.

3829
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:36,970
He's not like,

3830
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:37,211
oh,

3831
01:42:37,211 --> 01:42:37,421
I,

3832
01:42:37,421 --> 01:42:37,691
you know,

3833
01:42:37,691 --> 01:42:39,080
I don't sleep well at the restaurant.

3834
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:39,520
Yeah,

3835
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,860
that's a pretty big cut floor right there.

3836
01:42:41,890 --> 01:42:42,041
Yeah.

3837
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:43,060
There's like a number,

3838
01:42:43,061 --> 01:42:43,560
like a,

3839
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:47,500
a place where you go where you can't
bounce back when you're so much of a piece

3840
01:42:47,501 --> 01:42:49,810
of shit and so much of
a problem in society.

3841
01:42:49,811 --> 01:42:50,380
The camp,

3842
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:51,550
I say child molesters,

3843
01:42:51,551 --> 01:42:52,384
I say anything,

3844
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:53,770
anything along those murderers.

3845
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,570
Like you can't bounce back
from that and you can't,

3846
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:56,920
you gotta stop.

3847
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:57,611
You gotta go.

3848
01:42:57,611 --> 01:43:00,940
We gotta Clean House and it's just like
you have to prune trees and you know,

3849
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:04,360
like you have to shoot
horses have broken legs.

3850
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:05,213
All right.

3851
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:06,200
Right Brian?

3852
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:07,033
Yes.

3853
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:08,030
Fuck we talking about,

3854
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,120
it's supposed to be about religion.

3855
01:43:11,140 --> 01:43:11,950
So did you,

3856
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:13,780
you didn't learn anything doing this book,

3857
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:17,260
you will learn something about the
reactions to people that when you praise

3858
01:43:17,261 --> 01:43:18,094
yourself,

3859
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,380
controversy and even this conversation,

3860
01:43:20,381 --> 01:43:20,890
you know,

3861
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:21,790
I'm sure there's going to be people,

3862
01:43:21,791 --> 01:43:22,930
you're lucky you don't have a Twitter.

3863
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:23,710
See what is like,

3864
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:24,543
do you have a Facebook?

3865
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:25,360
Facebook?

3866
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:25,790
Yeah.

3867
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:26,160
Oh,

3868
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:26,930
what is it?

3869
01:43:26,930 --> 01:43:27,221
What's your,

3870
01:43:27,221 --> 01:43:28,030
is it Danielle?

3871
01:43:28,030 --> 01:43:28,500
Billowing?

3872
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:29,080
Yep.

3873
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:31,300
I have a nice picture of
me holding my daughter.

3874
01:43:31,301 --> 01:43:32,290
Flipping people off.

3875
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:33,220
Really?

3876
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:33,850
Yeah.

3877
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:34,151
Wow.

3878
01:43:34,151 --> 01:43:36,280
So you were preparing for
this response from the shelf?

3879
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:36,610
Yeah.

3880
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:39,740
Did you do that in a
response or you would like,

3881
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:42,280
that was my ethical though the
last few months where I was like,

3882
01:43:42,281 --> 01:43:43,360
I've been through enough share to,

3883
01:43:43,361 --> 01:43:45,370
that's kind of my feeling
toward the university.

3884
01:43:45,371 --> 01:43:46,001
No one end,

3885
01:43:46,001 --> 01:43:47,020
I'm protective of the,

3886
01:43:47,021 --> 01:43:48,240
all the good theme there is.

3887
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:48,611
And then,

3888
01:43:48,611 --> 01:43:48,751
yeah,

3889
01:43:48,751 --> 01:43:49,120
there I,

3890
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:50,180
I'm like fuck you all.

3891
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,300
Is your go to Karaoke Song?

3892
01:43:53,301 --> 01:43:55,780
I by Rem I chance no,

3893
01:43:55,790 --> 01:43:56,623
it's Pavarotti.

3894
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:57,633
That's right.

3895
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:58,850
You got that accent.

3896
01:43:58,851 --> 01:44:01,310
You might as well just bust
out some opera and go for it.

3897
01:44:01,311 --> 01:44:02,144
Right?

3898
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:05,570
Is that you saying it over there?

3899
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:05,990
Yeah.

3900
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:06,430
Okay.

3901
01:44:06,430 --> 01:44:07,263
You're all right.

3902
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:08,270
Don't hurt him.

3903
01:44:08,270 --> 01:44:09,260
Don't hurt yourself over there.

3904
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:10,850
Um,

3905
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:11,451
so your book,

3906
01:44:11,451 --> 01:44:12,284
when is it going to be out?

3907
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:13,310
And I should be this week,

3908
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:13,941
this week.

3909
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:15,350
Keep giving me different dates.

3910
01:44:15,351 --> 01:44:15,591
I mean,

3911
01:44:15,591 --> 01:44:17,510
Amazon has it for like December 20,

3912
01:44:17,511 --> 01:44:18,710
but that hasn't always gets it wrong.

3913
01:44:18,711 --> 01:44:21,310
So I talked to the publisher and they
told me that she'll be out this week.

3914
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,330
And it's Danielle Bolelli.

3915
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:24,173
Yup.

3916
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:26,300
How do you say it in Italian?

3917
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:26,910
Daniella.

3918
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:27,710

Balilla.

3922
01:44:29,370 --> 01:44:29,810
Yeah.

E.

3927
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:32,300
L.

3928
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:32,300
L.

3929
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:32,300
I.

3930
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:32,330
N.

3931
01:44:32,330 --> 01:44:32,751
You can,

3932
01:44:32,751 --> 01:44:33,200
uh,

3933
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:35,030
you can find him on Facebook if you want.

3934
01:44:35,031 --> 01:44:36,500
Look for the guy holding his daughter,

3935
01:44:36,501 --> 01:44:37,340
giving you the finger.

3936
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:38,121
And,

3937
01:44:38,121 --> 01:44:38,390
um,

3938
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:38,991
this has been fun,

3939
01:44:38,991 --> 01:44:39,290
man.

3940
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:40,490
Really interesting conversation.

3941
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:40,930
Thanks man.

3942
01:44:40,930 --> 01:44:41,450
Um,

3943
01:44:41,450 --> 01:44:42,021
and uh,

3944
01:44:42,021 --> 01:44:44,260
I hope people buy your book and uh,

3945
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:45,440
we got to come back again.

3946
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:46,340
We'll talk about some more shit.

3947
01:44:46,341 --> 01:44:48,170
I'm sure that's the beautiful
thing about religion.

3948
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:52,430
There's hundreds and hundreds of hours
of discussion just on the silliness,

3949
01:44:52,431 --> 01:44:52,940
right.

3950
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:55,230
May or drag anything.

3951
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:55,791
Beautiful.

3952
01:44:55,791 --> 01:44:56,451
It's been a lot of fun,

3953
01:44:56,451 --> 01:44:56,631
man.

3954
01:44:56,631 --> 01:44:57,171
Thank you very much.

3955
01:44:57,171 --> 01:44:58,004
Thank you on here.

3956
01:44:58,250 --> 01:44:58,610
All right.

3957
01:44:58,610 --> 01:44:58,820
Uh,

3958
01:44:58,820 --> 01:44:59,653
that's it folks.

3959
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:02,720

The makers of Alpha brain,

3967

the cognitive and enhancing
submit supplement.

3968
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:20,600
I can't,

3969
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:21,433
I should use some

3970
01:45:23,110 --> 01:45:24,980
talked to him once that
caffeine withdrawal.

3971
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:25,821
It is probably,

3972
01:45:25,821 --> 01:45:27,170
I'm probably half retarded now.

3973
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:27,741
The,

3974
01:45:27,741 --> 01:45:28,250
um,

3975
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:29,000
uh,

3976
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,230
the new stuff is new mood.

3977
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:32,870
It's a five HTP and l
tryptofan supplement.

3978
01:45:33,110 --> 01:45:34,610
And we also have shroom tech,

and B12 energy supplement.

3980
01:45:38,331 --> 01:45:41,690
That's fantastic for people who work
out really hard and I fucking love it.

3981
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:43,040
I'm really getting into that stuff lately.

3982
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,060
Um,

3983
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:49,060
this Wednesday as in tomorrow we are
having a show here at the Ice House in

3984
01:45:49,341 --> 01:45:49,881
Pasadena.

3985
01:45:49,881 --> 01:45:50,400
What time's the show,

3986
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:50,691
Brian?

3987
01:45:50,691 --> 01:45:51,021
I don't know.

3988
01:45:51,021 --> 01:45:51,950
I haven't figured it out yet.

3989
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:52,903
We haven't figured it out.

3990
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:54,470
That's how we roll bitches.

3991
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:55,370
It's wild.

3992
01:45:55,371 --> 01:45:56,330
We're crazy.

3993
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:58,190
But it will be a lot of cool guys.

3994
01:45:58,191 --> 01:45:59,450
Bert Kreischer is going to be on the show.

3995
01:45:59,451 --> 01:46:03,260
Bert Kreischer is also going to be on
the ice house chronicles podcast that we

3996
01:46:03,261 --> 01:46:05,210
do whenever we have a show
here at the ice house.

3997
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:05,780
We,

3998
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:09,320
during the time the guys are on
stage and before everyone's on stage,

3999
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:11,860
we'll do a podcast
right here at this desk,

4000
01:46:11,861 --> 01:46:12,694
squad studio.

4001
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:13,371
And so,

4002
01:46:13,371 --> 01:46:13,770
uh,

4003
01:46:13,770 --> 01:46:14,960
Christ will be on that.

4004
01:46:14,961 --> 01:46:16,190
And who knows how many other,

4005
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:17,720
hopefully Joey Diaz is Joey and town.

4006
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:19,000
I don't know.

4007
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,150
Mad Flavor bitches.

4008
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:23,510
What we'll have to bring Joe in and
we've been having some kickass shows.

4009
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:24,111
They're amazing.

4010
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:26,720
We had last one was Steevo bill burr.

4011
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:27,500
Uh,

4012
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:28,070
who else?

4013
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:28,210
Uh,

4014
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:29,360
Ari Shaffir.

4015
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:30,261
Joey Diaz,

4016
01:46:30,261 --> 01:46:30,951
Brendan Walsh,

4017
01:46:30,951 --> 01:46:31,401
me.

4018
01:46:31,401 --> 01:46:31,970
I mean we're,

4019
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:32,570
we're,

4020
01:46:32,570 --> 01:46:34,650
these are like the craziest
shows you get and it's,

4021
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:35,460
it's cheap.

4022
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:35,660
It's,

4023
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:35,931
what is it?

4024
01:46:35,931 --> 01:46:36,650
15 bucks.

4025
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:37,100
Yep.

4026
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:37,350
Yeah.

4027
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:38,031
15 bucks.

4028
01:46:38,031 --> 01:46:40,130
And it's a real cool place
because it's intimate.

4029
01:46:40,131 --> 01:46:41,180
It's only 85 seats.

4030
01:46:41,181 --> 01:46:42,980
And we also have a show Friday every week.

4031
01:46:42,981 --> 01:46:44,270
Usually I'd per desk.

4032
01:46:44,271 --> 01:46:44,421
Why?

4033
01:46:44,421 --> 01:46:45,980
Where I take all like the other people,

4034
01:46:45,981 --> 01:46:46,191
like,

4035
01:46:46,191 --> 01:46:46,371
you know,

4036
01:46:46,371 --> 01:46:47,230

Jason Teebo at time and all those guys.

4038
01:46:49,921 --> 01:46:50,880
And I give them like,

4039
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,200
they're their own separate show too.

4040
01:46:52,201 --> 01:46:52,650
So yeah,

4041
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:53,850
solid solid shows.

4042
01:46:53,851 --> 01:46:55,630
If you're around and you
want to check those out,

4043
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:56,160
I mean,

4044
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,560
even if you don't know the guy's names,

4045
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:59,910
[inaudible] guarantee you
if they're on the shows,

4046
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:00,744
they're solid.

4047
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:01,380
Um,

4048
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:02,220

Doug's Stan hope is going to join us.

4057
01:47:12,841 --> 01:47:15,630

01:47:34,051 --> 01:47:35,010

4069
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:45,840
That's it.

4070
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:46,860
It's fucking shows over.

4071
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:47,490
Thank you.

4072
01:47:47,490 --> 01:47:48,323
Daniella.

4073
01:47:48,370 --> 01:47:49,203
Daniella,

4074
01:47:49,810 --> 01:47:50,750
Daniella [inaudible],

4075
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:51,683
my friend.

4076
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:52,111
You've,

4077
01:47:52,111 --> 01:47:52,350
uh,

4078
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:55,230
brought us some very interesting
topics for conversation here.

4079
01:47:55,231 --> 01:47:57,450
And I'm gonna check out your
book and check out his new book.

4080
01:47:57,690 --> 01:47:59,760
50 things you're not supposed
to know about religion,

4081
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:02,070
which should be out this week on info.com.

4082
01:48:02,610 --> 01:48:03,750
Disendow this sinful,

4083
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,240
not info.com info.

4084
01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:06,330
They're much fucking liars.

4085
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:08,640
Just Info Dotcom or telling you the truth.

4086
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:09,451
Uh,

4087
01:48:09,451 --> 01:48:10,630
subscribe to death squad.

4088
01:48:10,631 --> 01:48:13,230
That's the only way on
[inaudible] subscribed to it.

4089
01:48:13,231 --> 01:48:15,180
Cause it's the only way you can
get the icehouse chronicles,

4090
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:17,190
which I think is one of the
best podcasts out there.

4091
01:48:17,191 --> 01:48:17,420
It's,

4092
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:17,790
it's,

4093
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:21,570
it's all of us hanging out
pre shows and after shows.

4094
01:48:21,571 --> 01:48:22,080
And it's,

4095
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:23,310
you get some hilarious shit out of it.

4096
01:48:23,311 --> 01:48:23,941
It's a lot of fun.

4097
01:48:23,941 --> 01:48:26,610
Everybody's getting amped up for the
show and there's a lot of shit talking.

4098
01:48:26,611 --> 01:48:29,540
And it's always fun when you got
like 10 comics in a room together.

4099
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:30,840
The last one was beautiful.

4100
01:48:30,841 --> 01:48:32,880
It was Joey Diaz and Brendan Walsh,

4101
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:34,000
and it was everybody.

4102
01:48:34,001 --> 01:48:35,100
And the one before with Yoshi.

4103
01:48:35,101 --> 01:48:35,340
I mean,

4104
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:35,491
they're,

4105
01:48:35,491 --> 01:48:35,731
they're,

4106
01:48:35,731 --> 01:48:36,564
they're really fun.

4107
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:37,140
All right.

4108
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:38,220
The fucking shows over.

4109
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:39,833
Love you bitches.

4110
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:40,660
See Ya.

4111
01:48:40,660 --> 01:48:40,850
Bye.
