1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,580
Two,
two,

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,200
two,
two,

3
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,420
two.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,190
I'm here with confirmed cosmin.
Not Steve.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,033
Oh yeah man.
Who's been to space a man who knows 

6
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:18,230
about the atmosphere.
I can't say I've been to space.

7
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:19,064
I went up and a Russian Mig fighter jet 
to the edge of the earth's atmosphere 

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,163
high.
Was that.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,650
Do you know how I fucking forget shit.
I fucking forget.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,440
But it wasn't that much higher than a 
normal flight is like.

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,170
And then what's like,
I've heard the gun go higher,

12
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:37,004
right?
They can go up to like 35,000 for 

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,910
commercial flight.
I want to say that,

14
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:40,500
that,
that,

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,580
that it might've been like,
not much more than 50,000,

16
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:44,414
but I,
I,

17
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,990
I can't back that up.
I don't remember.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,740
Maybe it was shockingly less than you 
would imagine.

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,401
Oh,
that's.

20
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:53,840
You had a video of it.
Does it show this wild boys?

21
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,400
Oh no shit going straight up right 
there.

22
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,470
They used a lot of,
uh,

23
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,430
they used a lot of stock footage,
but at the same time,

24
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:07,840
on the way down this motherfucker did 
Toros and fuck it was,

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,460
it wasn't like the gnarliest 
rollercoaster ride ever.

26
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,763
And,
and this is me filming myself like at 

27
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:17,990
that.
Oh my God,

28
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,960
it's fucking night up there.
Wow.

29
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:21,794
That's,
that shows for anybody wants to say the 

30
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:28,220
fucking world is flat.
That's fucking prove motherfuckers.

31
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,930
Well,
you can see the curvature of the earth.

32
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:31,010
Wow.
That's nuts.

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,410
And so when you were doing this,
um,

34
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,660
did,
did you get ghost close to blacking out?

35
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,560
Like how has the course?
Um,

36
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,160
I didn't get close to black men or 
anything like that.

37
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,510
And uh,
I,

38
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,810
I thought that that it would be one 
thing.

39
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,360
What it was was I was just fucking 
claustrophobic.

40
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,570
Madison cramped in this tiny little.
I get claustrophobic.

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,800
I didn't like that.
Did you do,

42
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,710
did they tell you how many g forces you 
were doing?

43
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,900
High.
That's another thing.

44
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:58,550
I can't remember.
But,

45
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,384
uh,
I feel like there was more g shit going 

46
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:02,060
on when we did the,
uh,

47
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,950
the zero gravity plane,
which,

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,350
uh,
you know,

49
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:07,184
it just kind of goes along and then it 
does a big bell curve kind of deal with 

50
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,003
siggy you become weightless and uh,
that one you could feel yourself really 

51
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:18,110
like being pulled down with the gs or 
whatever.

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,710
I did a flight with the F,
a teen with the blue angels wants.

53
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,570
Oh,
they took me up and the,

54
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,493
they take out as you go down to San 
Diego and then you travel east like 

55
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,863
through the desert.
It's weird and I don't know which air 

56
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:34,650
force bases out there.
It's like real close to,

57
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:36,900
I guess close to Arizona or maybe even 
in Arizona.

58
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,770
But uh,
we got to seven and a half gs.

59
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,973
We were doing these crazy things where 
you go like through these mountain 

60
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,750
ranges and you're only like a hundred,
maybe 200 feet off the ground

61
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,140
turning and twisting and fucking 
bananas.

62
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,740
Dude,
dude.

63
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,060
So they took you up and wild boys.
And what year was this?

64
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,010
Was okay.
We were

65
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,550
cool with the Russians then,
right?

66
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,570
That was 2005.
Yeah.

67
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:07,450
Two thousand five.
That was our last ever wild boys trip.

68
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,630
Yeah.
And uh,

69
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,430
we brought Knoxville with us.
Knoxville.

70
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,710
We had some,
uh,

71
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,340
like Russian army kind of dudes.
And the Knox was like,

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,233
shoot me with the nine millimeter gun 
with the rubber bullet while the dog 

73
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:27,100
bites me why he was,
he was going for it.

74
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:27,551
And,
and,

75
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:30,250
and uh,
our director Jeff Tremaine was like,

76
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,930
hey,
if you still have this in you,

77
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,680
why don't we not do it for TV?
Let's make another movie.

78
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:39,520
And that was why we stopped doing wild 
boys and made Jack as number two.

79
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,413
If you still have this in,
you want to get beaten down with rubber 

80
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,284
bullets,
when do we have a lot of shit happened 

81
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:46,481
on that.
Fuck.

82
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:48,450
On that last wild boys trip,
man,

83
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,160
there is a that we always,
we had this practice of like,

84
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,830
um,
for the sensors,

85
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:55,930
you know,
it's called standards and practices.

86
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,940
They'll be like,
they'll give back notes,

87
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:58,774
like you can't show this.
And so we would film what we call red 

88
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:02,794
herrings,
like just blatantly ridiculous shit is 

89
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,100
never like never going to be allowed on 
TV.

90
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,450
But then we'll be like,
okay,

91
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:11,170
well we'll cut this out and so then 
we'll be able to keep some other shit.

92
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,380
So we would always go out of her way to 
fill in this fucked up stuff.

93
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,840
And in Russia we,
um,

94
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,843
me and one of the guys from the,
from the crew should put like put on 

95
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:24,640
these animals suits the um,
what was it at the time,

96
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:29,350
it wasn't panda bears with polar bears 
with the big fucking like mascot head.

97
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,513
And we fucking hired two hookers and had
full on fucking hookers came in like 

98
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,710
full porno.
We felt like full fucking porno.

99
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,993
I went included to be included that in 
the episode I had the notes came back 

100
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:46,600
from standards and practices.

101
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,800
I can really pleased.
I got that.

102
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,500
You have to take out the,
you know,

103
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:51,400
the COC,
soccer.

104
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,530
We had the polar bear getting his dick 
sucked like that.

105
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:57,810
The whole thing.
And Yeah.

106
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,750
And,
and there were,

107
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,330
there was a little bit of fucking hooker
action in that one,

108
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:02,164
you know,
and I'm not necessarily that stoked 

109
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:04,271
about it,
but,

110
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,560
um,
there was uh,

111
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:08,220
we went to a,
went to like a whorehouse,

112
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,100
brought this hooker back to the hotel 
right there,

113
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,150
like a whole thing and then in,
in,

114
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:14,910
in the,
and,

115
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,130
and I don't think I ever could have sex 
with a,

116
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,993
with a hooker without like snuggling 
after I want to like snipe snuggle and 

117
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,570
studying it on,
like I wanted to stay with me.

118
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:26,404
I want to like,
you know,

119
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,010
cuddle and stuff.
And in the morning this,

120
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,330
this hooker,
um,

121
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,520
she just tells me how much,
how much I owe her.

122
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,590
And I'm like,
that's fucking outrageous.

123
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:37,410
There's no fucking way I was.
I was like,

124
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,790
basically,
I don't care if you're a fucking pimp,

125
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,100
wants to kick my ass and fucking kill 
me.

126
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:47,101
I'm not paying that fucking much.
I forget it was so long ago.

127
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,813
But,
uh,

128
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,660
but yeah,
I was outraged beforehand.

129
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,830
It,
it just,

130
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,920
it just wasn't in that case.
I remember clearly.

131
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,390
I like,
do you want that mentioned?

132
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,300
I said,
I said,

133
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,520
I'll give you this much,
and that's how much he get,

134
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,190
period.
And we,

135
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,040
we,
we,

136
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,090
we came out,
right?

137
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,953
Like,
um,

138
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,220
you know,
I got to go film and uh,

139
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,133
well I can through the lobby.
Knoxville is down there having 

140
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:13,244
breakfast.
This hooker comes walking by and knocks 

141
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:16,160
on.
She says,

142
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,570
that's not Steve.
Oh,

143
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,800
that's cheap bowl.

144
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,320
I was never even that much into like 
hookers,

145
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,780
but,
um,

146
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:30,960
but,
but,

147
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,541
you know,
in,

148
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:35,900
in looking back on it,
I guess I really fucking kind of had sex

149
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:37,940
with a bunch of hookers because,
um,

150
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,950
I had this girlfriend and um,
you know,

151
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,200
like I work at like a program of 
recovery.

152
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:47,660
I got to be honest and shit.
And I had this girlfriend,

153
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:50,610
she was an English chick and she says,
um,

154
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,360
have you ever had sex with a prostitute?
And I'm like,

155
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,100
Oh fuck,
you know,

156
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:56,640
and I tell her,
uh,

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,340
what's the,
you know,

158
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,550
I never did until I was in,
in,

159
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,090
in,
in England one time.

160
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,500
And uh,
you know,

161
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:05,570
there's,
we did this gumball rally where you race

162
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:06,950
cars,
all the rich guys.

163
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,000
And uh,
yeah,

164
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,300
they're getting hugs and they got me one
and,

165
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,463
and I brought her to the uts.
I told her the whole story about how I 

166
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:15,614
was,
I can't give me a massage and she's 

167
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:21,560
giving me a back rub and the hooker says
this is one expensive back rub.

168
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,320
And I felt like she was making fun of me
and I said,

169
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,303
fuck it.
And I put on Motley crue and put on a 

170
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:27,680
rubber and humped her.
Okay.

171
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,150
You know,
I told this story to my girlfriend.

172
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:30,050
She says,
I said,

173
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:31,330
okay,
what uh,

174
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,320
did you,
uh,

175
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,830
was there any other ones?
I'm like,

176
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:34,431
ah,
fuck,

177
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:34,941
you know,
I'm like,

178
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:37,310
well,
in New Zealand you know,

179
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:40,860
like there was a massage parlor and it 
turned out that,

180
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,940
that they just have sex with you,
you know,

181
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:44,570
like,
and it's a joke.

182
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:44,920
I,
you know,

183
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,920
it's like I didn't feel like I felt like
it was having sex with a prostitute,

184
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:54,170
but she was a misuse,
like another one.

185
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:54,831
I'm like,
wow,

186
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:58,580
there's a time in Indonesia.
So it just kept rolling off.

187
00:07:58,581 --> 00:07:59,414
Yeah.
And the thing was that at that exact 

188
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:03,560
time we were,
she'd like,

189
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,930
she arranged this trip to go to 
cornwall.

190
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,083
Uh,
it's a little surf town in England 

191
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,140
because I like collect pictures with a,
you know,

192
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:14,150
of the different countries where the 
united,

193
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,033
I call it my surf passport and I'm like,
I want to get a surfing photo so I can 

194
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:20,180
include England.
She's like,

195
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:21,014
she says,
I know why you're making it sort of 

196
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:22,664
passport.
You should have a fucking hooker 

197
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:24,314
passport.

198
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,410
It's so funny to like driving over here.
I was,

199
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,910
I was like thinking man,
fucking so nervous about going on,

200
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,080
on,
you know,

201
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:40,640
Joe Rogan's podcast because how can I 
touch the last time it was so epic,

202
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:41,474
like there's never been another 
interview that I've ever done that has 

203
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:46,640
gotten that.
I've gotten more feedback.

204
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,140
Like people just being like,
dude,

205
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:48,974
I fucking heard that.
Like people were like inspired people 

206
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:53,960
who are struggling with substance abuse 
and they're like,

207
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:54,441
man,
like,

208
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,340
that helped.
Helped me get sober.

209
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,530
Like Howard Stern,
like,

210
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,010
you name it.
Any interview I've ever done in my life,

211
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,600
like it has.
This has been the one that I,

212
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,670
the I hear about the most and then I get
the most positive feedback.

213
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,043
Fucking grateful deed for that man.
I'm grateful for you coming on and you 

214
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:13,950
can't compare yourself to yourself 
though.

215
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,690
Don't ever do that.

216
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,481
Okay.
I get that,

217
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:19,050
but it'll get you every time I get that.
I know.

218
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:21,180
I saw that.
Like on Jim Jefferies,

219
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,630
a Jim Jeffrey does.
I think he even did that on his,

220
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,900
on his special.
He's like all this special isn't as good

221
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,760
as my last specialty.
He said that on this special.

222
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,943
Right.
But that's the thing like I'm not gonna 

223
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,520
do that too much,
but in the moment,

224
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,840
right in the moment.
Stephen,

225
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,840
thank you for that Joe Guy.
I'm pretty,

226
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:40,674
pretty good about that but.
But I should say and I can like get in 

227
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:45,360
my head and I'm not going to trip myself
out,

228
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,403
but I did want to come in hot so I just 
fucking came out with the hooker story 

229
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,830
going from edge of space.
The earth isn't cloud dude,

230
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,903
firemen and pot.
Chris Ponti is my wild boys coastguard 

231
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,130
guy.
I remember at one point saying something

232
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:03,720
to the effect of like,
ah,

233
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:05,490
you know,
like I'm an astronaut,

234
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:06,800
you know,
I,

235
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,040
and,
and pawnee is,

236
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,770
if I can nailed me so hard,
is so fucking funny.

237
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:12,440
He says,
he says,

238
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,370
uh,
you're not,

239
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:18,030
not a virgin because you'd go to the 
edge of the girl's vagina.

240
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,690
Good point.
Right?

241
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:28,050
He kind of had to cross the goal line.
What was more dangerous doing jackass or

242
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:32,280
doing wild boys had to be wild boys.
That's what I was in times over man,

243
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,990
because I watched jackass and I go,
wow,

244
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:37,350
these guys are so crazy.
But I watched wild boys and literally my

245
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:39,370
asshole just tight.
And so dude,

246
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,690
my toes curl,
start clenching my hands together.

247
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:43,524
I can't do.
I don't know how the fuck you guys did 

248
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,040
it and got away with it,
right?

249
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,800
There's no question man.
Like a fucking lions.

250
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,050
Tigers,
bears venomous reptiles.

251
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,003
Yeah.
When that lion climbed a tree and beat 

252
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:56,520
your fucking hat,
here's the thing,

253
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,650
right?
And here's the thing.

254
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:59,171
And,
and,

255
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:04,070
and there is a distinction about this 
jackass for completely fade there.

256
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:04,904
There's so much integrity and jackass 
Knoxville like would not ever people 

257
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,490
says is the stuff you do real fuck adds 
real 100 percent.

258
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,340
And with wild boys there is no,
uh,

259
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,190
I mean,
what you see is it happened,

260
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,170
but what we were dishonest about with 
wild boys is like locations.

261
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:27,171
We would pretend that we were in Africa 
when really they had this fucking,

262
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,680
uh,
in California,

263
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:30,990
there's a company called like a 
Hollywood animals,

264
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:33,070
right?
Where they've got like a,

265
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,291
you know,
whatever.

266
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,930
They've got the fucking lions and the 
Tigers and shit.

267
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,340
Now when we went over to Africa the 
first time we brought the zebra suit,

268
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,790
every intention of being on safari 
playing around in front of lions,

269
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,770
but that just wasn't in the cards.
They're like,

270
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:47,870
no,
that's not gonna happen.

271
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,440
So we kill you.
But yeah,

272
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:50,274
we found that.
We found this great whole thing going 

273
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:52,164
through the safari to Mansi pursuit.
But the only way we could get the end 

274
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,490
was to come back to California.

275
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,510
And I remember Jay Leno fucking caught 
called.

276
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,340
This happened the first time we went on 
the Jay Leno show to promote wild boys.

277
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,174
He says,
you know,

278
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,210
I walk into the dressing room,
you,

279
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,150
I said,
I watched that,

280
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:08,400
uh,
that um,

281
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,400
lion clip with the two Mansi pursuit and
thinking,

282
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,160
you know,
I've never seen gravel like that,

283
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,620
you know,
in Africa on the ground.

284
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:20,800
And he says,
the way that the line went for the Zebra

285
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:21,640
head,
the Ca,

286
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,290
the,
he said,

287
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,480
no part of that.
Nope.

288
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:30,220
No part of that lion wants that fake 
zebra head,

289
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,870
you know,
it doesn't make sense.

290
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,360
And uh,
and he was so right.

291
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:35,380
He nailed it.
One hundred percent.

292
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,360
He's like,
I'm guessing what,

293
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,270
what they did was they rubbed some kind 
of shit on the zebra,

294
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:43,930
had to attract the line to it and he 
just broke it down.

295
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:44,901
You know,
I'd,

296
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:45,734
I have,
the last thing I want to do is be a 

297
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:49,540
fucking fan of Jay Leno,
but he was a good God.

298
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,470
You did.
Okay.

299
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,273
Okay.

300
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,700
He is,
I'm telling you,

301
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:55,534
man,
he just seems weird because he did the 

302
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,820
tonight show for so long.

303
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,263
Ah,
okay.

304
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,113
And I'm not trying to like just 
piggyback on Howard Stern being the 

305
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,210
stern fan,
but,

306
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:03,890
uh,
I don't know.

307
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,720
I got a weird vibe by myself from,
from Jay Leno,

308
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,603
but I'll take your word for it.
What impressed the shit out of me with 

309
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:12,840
that calling out that line.
But what weird vibe did you get home?

310
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,700
You don't know,
like,

311
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:15,534
uh,
I just felt like for all the times that 

312
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:23,430
we were guests or that I was on his 
show,

313
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,850
I just felt like A.
I don't know,

314
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,670
is it?
Yeah,

315
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:30,504
I think it's fair to say felt like maybe
a little bit todd talked down to in a 

316
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:38,250
way I felt like sorta.
I like,

317
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,084
I like the impression that I got was 
that whoever booked us on the show 

318
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:44,670
wasn't him and that he was sort of like 
under protest,

319
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,151
like,
you know,

320
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:45,984
maybe I'm just,

321
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,740
he was sort of under protest for almost 
everything that was on his show.

322
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,450
Right.
It was really a mess.

323
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,493
Look,
Jay Leno started out as one of the top 

324
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:57,480
stand up comics in the world.
He was a fucking killer.

325
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:58,314
He was a young guy who would go on 
letterman and he was edgy and this is 

326
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:01,720
like,
you know,

327
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,110
19 seventies or early 19 eighties,
whatever.

328
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:08,310
And then he got the tonight show and 
when he got the tonight show,

329
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,870
he became a tonight show host and he 
never put out.

330
00:14:12,871 --> 00:14:14,980
He doesn't still to this day,
it doesn't put out any standup.

331
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,030
You can't see it anywhere other than my 
tonight show.

332
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,680
Mommy blogs.
He does it every week,

333
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:21,570
but he does the same act.
Ah Shit.

334
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,100
Yeah,
he doesn't change his shit.

335
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,590
It's real weird.
He's a weird guy.

336
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,470
But what his real.
I mean he's still a great comic,

337
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:32,850
but his real passion is cars.
Like if you're a car guy and you go over

338
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:36,410
to his place,
you get to see the real Jay Leno and Oh,

339
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,110
you should've been doing like I did his 
show to a Jay Leno's garage.

340
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:40,944
I was like,
you should have been doing this the 

341
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:42,174
whole time.
Why did you even fuck with the tonight 

342
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:44,634
show?
Like you're,

343
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,650
you're a fucking monster when it comes 
to cars.

344
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,630
He's fun.
He's loose,

345
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,680
he knows everything about cars.
You get to see the him.

346
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,040
He

347
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,100
lights up.
I remember we were promoting a jackass.

348
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:55,934
Three d on the tonight show.
Went over there and we did the tee ball 

349
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:58,941
thing,
right,

350
00:14:58,941 --> 00:14:59,774
like where it's like a tee ball but it's
got an arm and he hit it and then swing 

351
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,090
it hits me in the nuts and,
and we did it.

352
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,050
I think it was like during rehearsal or 
so we did it like during rehearsal fully

353
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:09,884
hit me in the nuts or so,
and I wanted to demonstrate that I 

354
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,260
wasn't wearing a cup.
Right.

355
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,103
And I had these tidy whities on and I 
and I fucking pulled down my tighty 

356
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:21,470
whities to show it was just my dick,
but he didn't really need to do.

357
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:26,590
I'm part of the problem.
He's so old school and,

358
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,220
and uh,
that's the,

359
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,410
I see it clearly now and he said it,
he goes,

360
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,640
it looks like a dick.

361
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:39,670
Just a lot smaller,
but I that,

362
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,980
that was just part of A.
I don't know,

363
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:44,780
that's just part of where I got that 
vibe from him.

364
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:46,920
But the last thing I don't want to feel 
like,

365
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:48,050
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean.

366
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:50,360
And then there was a dollar dispute with
him and Howard Stern.

367
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,440
Sure.
Because like,

368
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:52,274
what was it going on?
Like writers were taken bits from stern 

369
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:56,110
and doing it on.
Right.

370
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,120
I can't even remember at this.
Howard so hated Johnny Carson too,

371
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,720
right?
Yeah.

372
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,521
Well,
you know what,

373
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:05,354
man,
that's one of those things where a lot 

374
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,340
of those guys,
you know,

375
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
especially like if you have a platform 
like Howard,

376
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,530
you feel distraught by.
Some guys got another platform with fuck

377
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:14,240
this guy tell to go to war.
She was.

378
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,330
Howard's whole thing was about conflict.
Conflict is ratings.

379
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,870
He was the king of ratings with Jay Leno
and Howard.

380
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,703
It was personal with,
with Howard and cars and I think he was 

381
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:24,734
just.
Howard had the impression that Carson 

382
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:27,800
was a bad dude.
I don't know.

383
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:30,620
I think he had a personal thing.
I'm maybe I'm just making that up,

384
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,173
but I'm telling you man,
I knew Jay from the tonight show and 

385
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:37,730
knew Jay from when I was on NBC.
I've seen him on here with you too,

386
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,930
dude.
He was great on here.

387
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,020
The stories about like doing standup for
the mob shows.

388
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,090
I've seen some psychopath mob guy at a 
priest did.

389
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,120
They were great.
Fucking,

390
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,760
hey dude,
I fucking,

391
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,623
I recant anything negative said about 
Jayla plus I should say I'm fucking 

392
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,860
grateful it's Jay Leno because he had,
you know,

393
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,260
I never,
I was never on Letterman.

394
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,000
No.
Yeah.

395
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:03,470
What was the thing too,
with those dudes?

396
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:04,304
If you did one,
you couldn't do the other unless you're 

397
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:07,640
like,
you know,

398
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,830
someone who's like a humongous star.

399
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,050
Yeah,
those shows suck.

400
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,090
They're really do.
They're just not.

401
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,740
No,
no disrespect to them,

402
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:18,920
but those five minute things,
we sit on the couch,

403
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,880
then you cut to the next thing.
It's just right.

404
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,883
It's just a shitty way to get to know 
somebody and it's gone downhill from 

405
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,250
there because all anybody gives a fuck 
about is what's gonna,

406
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,500
you know,
take off on the Internet the next day.

407
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,660
Exactly.
They're not even,

408
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,560
they're not even focused on anything 
except some fucking gimmick.

409
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:38,740
That's gonna some highlight reel clip,
right?

410
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,903
Yeah.
Did you see the whole bear thing where 

411
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:44,510
he went off on trump?
I couldn't fucking believe it.

412
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:45,650
I was watching it.
I was like,

413
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,460
I and I,
I tweeted about this,

414
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:48,294
that I don't think kids today have any 
idea how strange it is to watch a talk 

415
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:52,584
show host.
Call the president's mouth a cock 

416
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,760
holster.
Okay.

417
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,770
This is talking about the president.
I mean,

418
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:04,110
I know it's tunneled trump,
but it's still the president.

419
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,770
There's weird.
There's a lot of weird stuff going on.

420
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:12,771
And then did you see a Koala bear 
responding to trump's response?

421
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,860
That made me uncomfortable.
Why?

422
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,130
I'm sure people don't want to even hear 
about it.

423
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,780
No,
please do.

424
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,700
It made me uncomfortable where he's 
like,

425
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,550
I won and you know,
like,

426
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,320
I mean it's,
it's again,

427
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,820
it's just playing into,
you know,

428
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,700
what,
what can I do?

429
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,760
What he said was he got trumped to 
response trying to get.

430
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,733
He was trying to get the president to 
say his name for so long and he finally 

431
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:37,134
did and it was what he said was that I 
thought you of all the things that I 

432
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,054
thought you were dumb about,
the one thing that I thought you knew 

433
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:45,860
about with show business,
I thought you understood showbiz.

434
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,273
So like,
I was trying to get you to respond and 

435
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:50,400
you did.
So I win,

436
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,740
right?
Which is just.

437
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,450
Okay.
So now the president didn't.

438
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,293
This is even weird because weirder 
because now the president is responding 

439
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:01,290
to a guy who's essentially saying that 
he's a fucking troll.

440
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,650
I mean Steven Cole Bear multimillionaire
talk show host on a major network,

441
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,033
took over the letterman spot is now 
admitting that he's essentially like a 

442
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:15,610
guy on twitter.
There's a fucking egg icon.

443
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,930
I think that that might've been what 
made me feel uncomfortable,

444
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,470
just low level,
super low level,

445
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,663
low level.
And,

446
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,900
and,
and uh,

447
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,093
it wasn't like all this stuff that trump
was saying about how they were going to 

448
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:29,604
take them off and they're gonna know the
guy coordinator came after they were 

449
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:35,440
going to put James Corden into Koala 
bears time slot.

450
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,690
Like,
I mean,

451
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,330
the other reports I saw were that they 
were trying to get cold,

452
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:40,164
bear the fuck out,
and then all of a sudden he started 

453
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:44,460
slamming trump and now he's like number 
one out of everybody in late night.

454
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,900
Well,
that's how it goes.

455
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:46,734
And that stupid fucking business.
They just have to get people to pay 

456
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:51,060
attention to them and sometimes that's 
the way to do it.

457
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,610
I mean,
maybe Cole bear just got Desperado,

458
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,660
but it's the whole thing is so fucking 
strange.

459
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,810
Like Kobe or strange man.
He's like a hardcore Catholic,

460
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,423
hardcore,
which is even weirder that he's calling 

461
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,420
the president's mouth a cock holster.
Was a hardcore Catholic.

462
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,510
Where do your,
where your standard Sli,

463
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,733
like where you,
uh,

464
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,820
where do you draw that line?
Right.

465
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,510
It's not very Catholic,
have you?

466
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,493
It's like the guy from megadeath,
the lead singer megadeath became like a 

467
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,580
super hardcore Christian really and now 
won't sing some of his songs.

468
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,730
Get the fuck you and he won't perform 
with some certain death metal bands.

469
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:35,870
Come on,
God,

470
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,280
come right back.
A fantastic man.

471
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,050
There's something happens.
I don't know if you noticed this,

472
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:44,880
but something happens that I've been 
noticing.

473
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,200
As you know,
I'm almost 50.

474
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,640
I'll be 50 in August.
Did bless your heart.

475
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,810
Bless your heart.
I'll be,

476
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,900
I'll be 43 next month.
Two to just creeps up on.

477
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:55,510
You did timely.
As faster as it goes by if.

478
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,630
Well,
you know what it is,

479
00:20:56,631 --> 00:21:00,220
it's like your reference to time is 
different because when you're six,

480
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,510
a year is a sixth of your life.
When you're 49,

481
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,010
it's like another year.
It's like also you're busy as fuck.

482
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,890
So the days keep moving.
Quick reference time.

483
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,870
I think it also goes by faster.
It seems like it goes by faster,

484
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,360
right?
You have more of them to think about.

485
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,130
I had a bit that I was working on for 
the long time.

486
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,830
I don't know if I'm going to resurrect 
it,

487
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:26,740
but the premise is that God must hate 
us.

488
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,620
Premise why she'd be dead.
Loved one.

489
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,780
No,
no.

490
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,643
You'd be suffering.
Think about you'll live in lack of a 

491
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:38,140
Steevo.
How could that hit?

492
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:39,160
Got Hit you.
He loves you.

493
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,941
Right?
Right.

494
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:40,681
Well,
I mean it's,

495
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:41,770
it's,
it's broken comedy,

496
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:42,604
right?
I mean,

497
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,470
it makes sense though,
right?

498
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,440
Sure.
And,

499
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
and I back it up,
dude.

500
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:47,554
I back it up.
They do that a kit now we're the only 

501
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,800
living organism,
right?

502
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,770
They can watch and have an opinion of 
itself wilting.

503
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,660
Right.
That's a good point.

504
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,350
It's a fucking really good point.
You know,

505
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,910
a fucking bananas not looking in the 
mirror saying off,

506
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,600
fuck,
I'm bruising the sides.

507
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,240
Like I don't look as good as I did 
fucking,

508
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,610
you know,
I'm going to rot and.

509
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,380
But what's really weird is when you 
watch,

510
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,273
do you watch videos of yourself from a 
long time ago and you see how different 

511
00:22:17,831 --> 00:22:18,490
you look?

512
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,190
Yes.
But I think uh,

513
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,053
uh,
have a lot of people I like pretty 

514
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:25,510
fucking.
I look less like,

515
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,710
less different than other people and now
I get like super sensitive about like,

516
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:30,544
you know,
if I posted a picture on lines and 

517
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,110
motherfuckers,
Oh,

518
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:32,963
do you know,
like,

519
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,780
shit effect it effects like I wish it 
didn't but it does,

520
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:39,220
man.
I'm a fucking sensitive guys.

521
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,100
Motherfuckers old.
But now I got,

522
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,440
now I got a uh,
a project that I'm working on where,

523
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:47,950
where I'm digging up like old ass 
footage and I'm looking at it.

524
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,190
I'm thinking I don't look that much 
different.

525
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,820
Fuck all these people,
you know,

526
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,110
maybe you're delusional.
I may look younger for sure.

527
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:58,630
But like,
uh,

528
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,490
it was,
there was a,

529
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,700
I don't know,
like I fucking,

530
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,350
well you've kept your body in reasonable
shape,

531
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:06,580
your engagement,
your healthy.

532
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,830
That was real issues when people 
balloon.

533
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,470
I looked at Kathleen Turner.
Do you remember?

534
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,690
Kathy went to my high school in London,
England.

535
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,553
Dude,
she was so hot when she was young and 

536
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:18,310
now she's like,
right,

537
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,173
like she's got that alcoholic face where
people don't just get older but 

538
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:27,020
everything sort of balloons.
And you know,

539
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,873
your,
your cheeks balloon in your Chin 

540
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:31,920
balloons.
Sure.

541
00:23:31,921 --> 00:23:32,754
All swelling.
And it's crazy to like I went to high 

542
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:36,154
school all four years in London,
England at the American School in 

543
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:39,994
London,
England and there's only called the 

544
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,910
American school,
the American School in London,

545
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:43,744
England.
So I don't have an accent because 

546
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:46,100
everyone was just American

547
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,780
at this school in my neighborhood.
I'm really.

548
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:51,770
So it was actually everyone at the 
school was in England.

549
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:53,750
They have like different fucking kind of
high school.

550
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:55,130
It's that guy.
It's not grades,

551
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:57,650
it's like forms.
He graduated and when you're 16 it's all

552
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:59,810
different curriculum.
But this is in England,

553
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:02,330
in London.
And you take your sats,

554
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:05,690
you have like American African American.
It's an American school in London.

555
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:08,720
Yeah.
Your folks were living in England folks?

556
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,000
Correct?
I grew up in five different countries.

557
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:11,961
Did you really?
Yeah.

558
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:12,794
I was born in England and uh,
when I was six months old and moved to 

559
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,800
Brazil and my family moved to Brazil.
It's like,

560
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,140
it's no one would ever fucking gets 
this.

561
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:25,360
But my dad was like a baller ass 
corporate executive real.

562
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:29,840
And when I was six months old my family 
moved to Brazil because my dad,

563
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,520
I became the president of Pepsi Cola in 
all of Brazil.

564
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,840
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

565
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,860
So he did.
So they ever fucking had shit going on,

566
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,723
like they live in maids and um,
I was raised by fucking like these 

567
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:50,120
Brazilian servants that lived,
that lived in the house.

568
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:53,460
So I spoke my first word in Portuguese.
Wow.

569
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,940
My,
my parents didn't.

570
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,720
My parents just didn't fucking pay 
attention to me.

571
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,550
So that's what made you crazy perhaps.
Yeah.

572
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,480
They deal with you now.
Um,

573
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,830
while my mom died in 2003 and my dad and
I are fucking tight as fuck everything.

574
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,530
That was cool.
Yeah,

575
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,383
everything that the drove apart brought 
us together and spoke my first words in 

576
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:16,964
Portuguese in Brazil when I was two 
years old I moved to Venezuela and I 

577
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:23,210
spoke fluent Spanish in nursery school 
in Caracas,

578
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:24,890
Venezuela.
Holy Shit.

579
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,650
When I was four years old and moved to,
to uh,

580
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,700
Connecticut.
So by the time I was three,

581
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,240
I spoke three languages fluently.

582
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,120
By the time I was five I forgot to have 
them completely.

583
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,373
And then when I was six years old we 
moved to Miami when I was nine years 

584
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:42,680
old.
Moved to London,

585
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:46,010
England when I was 12 years old,
moved to Canada,

586
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:46,844
lived in Toronto and then 13 years old 
back to England and I stayed there all 

587
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:51,470
through high school.
Wow.

588
00:25:51,471 --> 00:25:54,840
So this is all your dad just being an 
effort,

589
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,210
different companies within the moved 
from Brazil to Venezuela.

590
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:00,044
Dad got promoted to fuck.
Or the president of Pepsi Cola in South 

591
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,460
America I think maybe like maybe all of 
South America.

592
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:11,210
I'm not sure.
Then when we moved to,

593
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,370
uh,
to Connecticut,

594
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:17,270
I want to say that's when dad became a 
fucking a big tobacco CEO.

595
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,730
Whoa.
Hilarious.

596
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:20,923
Yeah.
Smoke.

597
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,173
Um,
he never fucking took a puff on a 

598
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:24,704
cigarette in his life ever because an 
executive I fucking didn't do dad sold 

599
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:30,134
soda,
Pepsi Bucket and just sugar water than 

600
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,303
cigarettes.

601
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,380
And then when we,
when we were living in Miami,

602
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,573
this is the 19 eighties and all the 
sudden it came to light that cigarettes 

603
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:41,204
were bad for you and right.
And all the tobacco companies started 

604
00:26:45,211 --> 00:26:46,960
buying up food companies,
you know,

605
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,940
because it's thinking,
fuck,

606
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,530
we got to get out,
we to get out of this.

607
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:55,070
And so my dad worked for Rjr,
which is a tobacco company and Rjr,

608
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,850
Rj Reynolds,
what?

609
00:26:56,851 --> 00:27:01,020
It was rj reynolds and they bought 
Nabisco and the companies merged.

610
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:01,854
It became Rjr Nabisco and that dad had 
an aberration only good year that year 

611
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,483
that,
that ended up becoming like the 

612
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:11,310
president of Nabisco and shit.
Wow.

613
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,680
Yeah.
I forget if it was,

614
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:14,514
um,
I don't really know what they didn't 

615
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,720
figure out until the 19 eighties and 
cigarettes are bad for you.

616
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,820
They only really only became a legal 
issue in the eighties,

617
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,200
like lawsuits and shit.

618
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,981
Right.
They,

619
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:26,814
they,
they only really got fucking scared of 

620
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:30,000
lawsuits in the eighties.
You know what's crazy?

621
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:33,360
I just read something about tobacco 
companies that they're making more money

622
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:34,194
now than ever that less people smoke,
but they charge more for cigarettes now 

623
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:39,410
than they ever have before.
Oh my God.

624
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:42,780
Australia in Australia,
it's 20 fucking dollars a pack.

625
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,940
What?
Twenty fucking dollars.

626
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:47,540
A pack of $20 American or $20.
Australian trillion.

627
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,630
$20 Australian exchange,
right?

628
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,090
It's full of parody to the Canadian 
dollar.

629
00:27:52,091 --> 00:27:52,924
So pretty close to our one.
One Australian dollar is seventy five 

630
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,743
cents,
um,

631
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,310
for,
for American students.

632
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,144
So fucking funny.
I was over there and I've done a couple 

633
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,304
of Australia,
a few Australia tours and I went in 

634
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:05,664
there,
they got the fucking cigarettes locked 

635
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:10,110
up.
Like you can't even see them.

636
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:12,090
They're in a fucking,
like a gun cabinet.

637
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,200
You gotta you gotta ask them to unlock 
the gun cabinet,

638
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:17,370
which you can't even see into.

639
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,090
And then like it's illegal for them to 
even have a fucking,

640
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,470
uh,
a logo.

641
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,360
Like there's no logo,
there's no,

642
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:27,170
nothing like even the name like 
Marlboro.

643
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,013
They don't,
they can't use the brand name of 

644
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,750
Marlboro every fucking cigarettes.
Uh,

645
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,350
the name of the company has to be in the
same fucking font.

646
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,213
They can't even,
they can't even have the Marlboro logo 

647
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:43,530
or font.
It's all a uniform of font that says the

648
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,830
company and the entire fucking pack is 
just the most.

649
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:47,963
The whole fucking packaging is nothing 
but one gigantic photo of like a dead 

650
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:56,700
baby.
The most hilarious fucking like shit.

651
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,593
And I'm telling you that.
And it's $20 per pack and everybody's 

652
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,124
fucking smoking.
I think that's the craziest thing about 

653
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:07,194
it,
is it the more that they charge more 

654
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:10,290
than ever.
And there you go.

655
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,670
Full screen with Jesus Christ.
That causes blindness.

656
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,163
Folks that were going,
I'd spoken causes throat and mouth 

657
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:22,860
cancer brand.
Same brand in the same fucking font.

658
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,270
Why am I so fucking hilarious?
Lapsed doesn't work,

659
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:28,723
dude.
It doesn't keep people from buying at 

660
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,830
and t,
I mean,

661
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:34,900
imagine that.
Imagine picking up a new pack.

662
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:39,901
Everything that is so fucking bizarre.
They got straight as he got dead babies.

663
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:41,424
They gotTa fucking Causes Emphysema.
Grandma Frankie knows every single one 

664
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:47,340
of them is so fucking hilarious.
Yeah,

665
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,183
I've never seen that.
I've seen in England they have a big 

666
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:51,664
picture of like people that have lung 
cancer and shit on the cover it says 

667
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:58,570
smoking will kill you,
but they don't have this shit.

668
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:02,860
What the fuck causes peripheral vascular
disease?

669
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:06,940
It makes your feet rot.
Gang Green Day was the most team picture

670
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:07,774
I saw on a pack of cigarettes was um,
it was a picture of a toilet with blood 

671
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,900
in the water and I forget what the point
was on that one.

672
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,860
But cigarettes make your asshole bleed.
Isn't that crazy?

673
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,030
That,
that doesn't even work.

674
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:22,923
Like you're selling someone something 
that you're showing them all the 

675
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:27,100
terrorists shit that it could do.
And everybody's like,

676
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:27,934
yeah,
worth it.

677
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,890
Right where the front pipe.
I know,

678
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:33,070
I used to be convinced.
I remember Dr Dre,

679
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Dr Dre used to Pester me to try and get 
me on that celebrity rehab show before I

680
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:42,310
was sober and he had another project 
which was trying to,

681
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,530
uh,
it was focused on getting people to quit

682
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:46,570
smoking cigarettes.
Were you smoking at the time?

683
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,463
I smoked for fucking 17 years.
I started smoking when I was 16 and 

684
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:53,320
stopped when I was 33.
Whoa.

685
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,210
Yeah.
Seventeen years.

686
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:57,850
I fucking smoked man.
Do you feel any ill effects of it now?

687
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,720
Forty three.
Uh,

688
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,160
almost 43.
And how's your cardio?

689
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,383
I think it's pretty good.
What fucked up my cardio was all that 

690
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:07,480
nitrous oxide dude.

691
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,180
I thought that material.
I went and I went through,

692
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,373
there was whippet cartridges.
There's 24 per box and there's 25 boxes 

693
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:17,284
per case.
So per case there's 600 cartridges and 

694
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:24,190
it was not unusual for me to go through 
624 hour,

695
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,033
24 to 36 hours.
I went and I took every measure to try 

696
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:34,531
to limit like the fucking air that went 
into my lungs to try to make it like all

697
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:39,790
nitrogen oxide.
Like I was the whole time I'm holding,

698
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:44,050
I'm holding in a long flow of that shit 
and I'm just with my fucking camp,

699
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:44,884
the canister from starbucks and Shannon.
I was like a fucking wizard at like 

700
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:52,100
loading up six until while holding the 
last fucking ones,

701
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,350
you know,
and,

702
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:54,184
and dear.
That was when all the crazy shit would 

703
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:56,954
go down because that would be like awake
on cocaine for three days and inhaling 

704
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,084
nothing but nitrous oxide at that point 
is when shit starts popping off and 

705
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:06,550
people,
people are.

706
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,360
People are walking around my apartment 
who are never physically there.

707
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,340
I was seeing a bunch of shit.
Oh Dude,

708
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,130
like actual fucking people,
man.

709
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:18,460
I watched a dude walk through my 
apartment and fucking pick up,

710
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,503
pick up my bong and take a hit and blow 
out smoke at fucking then like put it 

711
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:25,210
down.
And the dude walked through the wall.

712
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:30,211
He wasn't never fucking.
They're every looked as real as I did.

713
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,030
I had fucking like tactile 
hallucinations.

714
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:36,580
I had fucked.
Could feel things big time dude.

715
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,800
Because here's like,
here's my whole thing.

716
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:40,100
And,
and

717
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,920
I kind of still believe this to this day
is,

718
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,910
you know,
that like our little,

719
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,103
our little,
a three dimensional experiences is very 

720
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,783
small,
small part of what's going on in the 

721
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:53,240
universe right there.
There's dimensions,

722
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:54,320
there's,
you know,

723
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,820
all frequencies,
everything and that like did,

724
00:32:58,821 --> 00:32:59,654
if you do enough drugs like um,
the barriers between these different 

725
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:06,410
compartments of the universe becoming 
eroded somehow,

726
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:08,190
you know,
like I started hearing voices and,

727
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:13,070
and to an extent I fucking believe still
that that shit was real.

728
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:13,560
Like,
uh,

729
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,440
these spirits that we're fucking talking
to me.

730
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:16,274
I'm hearing the voices,
like I had a conversation with a friend 

731
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:18,764
of mine sells weed about a very similar 
thing where I was saying that I think 

732
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,780
that something happens when the,
when you smoke pot,

733
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:27,614
it's not just that you get high,
but that the way you interface with the 

734
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:33,800
world changes and then the world changes
because of that.

735
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:34,963
Not,
not the world changes the world changed 

736
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:37,034
for you or for him,
but the world that I'm experiencing 

737
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,010
different.
Yeah.

738
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,870
Like in the quantum physics kind of 
sense.

739
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,430
I don't know.
I'm too stupid for that.

740
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,590
What I'm saying is that my feeling about
the world is that when you,

741
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,410
when you change the way your brain 
works,

742
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,330
which is essentially what you're doing 
to get really high,

743
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,310
he changed the way you think about the 
world.

744
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,220
I think the world that you experience is
different.

745
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,083
Sure.
It's like,

746
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,193
you know,
like people think like this is a very 

747
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:04,160
simplistic way of looking at it,
but it's sort of parallel.

748
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:05,270
You know,
some people think,

749
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,380
oh,
the world sucks.

750
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:08,750
Everything sucks and their life always 
sucks,

751
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,930
and then there's people that are always 
super positive and super happy and their

752
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:12,764
life is always happening.
There's something about when you get 

753
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,373
like really high,
like especially marijuana because 

754
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:21,770
marijuana is a sensitivity drug.

755
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,730
It's almost like the opposite of a lot 
of drugs because a lot of drugs make you

756
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,870
insensitive.
Like alcohol makes you belonged,

757
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,630
right?
You,

758
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,730
you're not aware of people looking at 
you,

759
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:33,020
you don't give a fuck.
You're like,

760
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:34,490
Whoa,
you get drunk,

761
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:38,690
you get her loud and you're crazier and 
your social cues get skewed.

762
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:41,210
You don't see marijuana has the 
opposite.

763
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,313
Marijuana.
You get like really aware of other 

764
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:47,540
people.
People will call it paranoid because you

765
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:48,374
start thinking about all these 
possibilities that you never thought of 

766
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:52,274
before,
but I feel like the way you interface 

767
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:55,454
with the world becomes very different.
You're aware of all these different 

768
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:00,020
possibilities.
You start thinking about things that you

769
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:02,280
fucked up when you were in high school.
You know,

770
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,460
you start thinking of mushrooms are the 
worst for that.

771
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,600
Oh yeah.
Oh sure.

772
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,430
Oh God,
I made a mistake.

773
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,430
It makes you accountable.
I get too introspective.

774
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:13,190
I mean I been forever,
but is it too introspective?

775
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,083
I got,
I got to house how to like just started 

776
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:20,410
picking myself apart like a and you 
know,

777
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,880
putting myself on trial in a sense right
now,

778
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:27,560
like just too introspective or I've just
determined that I just suck,

779
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:30,350
you know?
But maybe that's just a perspective.

780
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,080
Like I think the introspective aspect of
it,

781
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:36,500
one of the reasons why it comes up,
it feels like to me is because there's a

782
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,980
bunch of shit about yourself that you

783
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,420
don't like,
but you don't address.

784
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,660
So if it forces you,
hey,

785
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,720
in order to truly live in the moment,
you have to be balanced.

786
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,613
You have to be like,
I've looked at it at all and I don't 

787
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,190
understand.
I made mistakes and here's where I'm at.

788
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,220
But if you've never looked at yourself,
if you never looked at those mistakes,

789
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,360
then you should have like this backlog 
of shit you have to deal with.

790
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,140
And I agree with that.
I agree with that.

791
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:05,850
Except when it becomes just a morbid 
fucking flogging of oneself,

792
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,990
right?
Oh yeah,

793
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,890
for sure.
Which is,

794
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,723
which is what it would come to,
but I feel like that more flogging 

795
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,340
yourself comes from you.
Like the,

796
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,293
the debt analogy is a good analogy 
because if you're like massive debt and 

797
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:18,210
you go to spend money,
you know,

798
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,940
because I don't even have any money,
how am I spending this money?

799
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,120
Whereas if you're even and you go to 
spend the money,

800
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,140
you're like,
no big deal.

801
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,690
I'm just spending some money.
It's normal.

802
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,653
Right?
I think that when you don't have an 

803
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:30,114
accounting of who you are and what 
you've done and especially I think the 

804
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:35,560
big one is your effect on other people,
you know,

805
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,910
that's the one that comes up with me on 
mushrooms or on pot,

806
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,330
especially on edibles.
It's like how I've interacted with other

807
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:43,164
people and even if I thought it was 
justified and maybe I was justified 

808
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,750
when,
when it comes up on pot,

809
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,170
especially on edibles,
the big one for me at least,

810
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,033
that's where I feel like the most 
accountable I'm gonna have to think 

811
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:56,184
about like my behavior the most.
I always feel like with the edible 

812
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:00,540
thing,
it always feels like,

813
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,630
could I have done better?
Instead of just being like,

814
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:04,260
was I okay?

815
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,621
Like,
yeah,

816
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:06,870
that guy was being a dick to you.
You have fuck him.

817
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,793
It's never that.
It's always like maybe I could have 

818
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,483
caught on earlier to how he was feeling 
and three assessed how I was 

819
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:20,250
communicating with them and then instead
of being defensive or aggressive,

820
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,263
right.
I mean maybe I could've handled it 

821
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:23,260
better.
Why?

822
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,303
Hey Man.
It sounds like you're working a great 

823
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:30,831
spiritual program with your edibles.
I tried to do it all the time,

824
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:35,100
but when I'm with edibles,
like I said this before and people go,

825
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,973
oh no,
but I think pot makes you a better 

826
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,214
person.
I really do because I think all that 

827
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,100
responsibility and accountability pot.
But you know,

828
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,740
my partner to my boos,
bone bone is connected to.

829
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,550
Right?
You don't have to look.

830
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,680
You don't.
Honestly,

831
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:53,160
no one has to do anything.
I get as much high and as much.

832
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,023
Um,
mental clarity from yoga is I do 

833
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,850
anything.
I really do dope.

834
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,680
I mean if someone told me I couldn't 
smoke pot for the rest of my life,

835
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,203
but I could do yoga or I could just 
smoke pot for the rest of my life and 

836
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:08,250
not to yoga.
I think I would take the yoga.

837
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,550
Wow.
I really do because Yoga gives me,

838
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:12,630
um,
I mean,

839
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:14,670
I love the feeling of pot.
I really do.

840
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,850
But Yoga gives me,
um,

841
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,690
a relaxation when it's over,
like a,

842
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,620
there was a clarity that comes from 
things that was like,

843
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,560
it's friendly after Blake Post Yoga 
class,

844
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,690
those are like the,
that is the friendliest,

845
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:30,990
nicest group of fucking people go Stan,
you want to meet some Nice folks?

846
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,870
Stand outside of a yoga class window.
Yoga classes,

847
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:34,704
exiting.
You'll meet like the most balanced nice 

848
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:39,550
people because they drained all the 
bullshit of themselves.

849
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,760
He created pause so I can take a leak 
already.

850
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,640
I'm going,
we're not,

851
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,720
we're not pausing though.

852
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,010
He's such a good guy.
He really is.

853
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,610
He's such a good guy and he's always 
like worried that he's not a good guy.

854
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:56,320
And he's always like,
you know,

855
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:59,770
like coming down on himself and we'll 
talk about this a little bit.

856
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,990
Um,
Al Madrigal,

857
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:04,680
I'll set this up so he doesn't have to.
So he doesn't have to be uncomfortable.

858
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,350
Allah magical.
When he was here was talking about he,

859
00:39:07,351 --> 00:39:08,184
he gets mad at guys like Steevo because 
Steevo is a guy who kinda came to stand 

860
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:18,130
up after he did other things.
And now it's like I don't want the thing

861
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:21,520
that is like what I feel is my chosen 
thing in life,

862
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:22,354
the most amazing thing in life to me to 
be something that someone comes to as a 

863
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:28,570
last resort.
But I'll even thinks it's stupid that he

864
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:29,404
thinks like that.
And then so like when he said I like 

865
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:32,320
Steve,
I was Kinda bumped down.

866
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:37,321
So Steve Texted me about it and Steve 
and I talked and I told we were supposed

867
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:38,674
to do a podcast anyway.
So it was like this question of whether 

868
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:45,400
or not we should talk about it like when
it came to the actual show itself.

869
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:46,234
But my feeling on all that stuff is that
it's whoever does stand up just stand 

870
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,010
up.
Like it's bullshit.

871
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:54,280
I was just explaining that you're a 
great guy and the whole al magical thing

872
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,470
without you having to be in the room and
feel uncomfortable.

873
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,710
But I think that anybody like that 
judgment thing of like,

874
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,490
this is not a stand up.
You're not a standup.

875
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,550
He's not a standing.
Right.

876
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,850
So insecure.
It's so crazy.

877
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,730
Especially when your premise is that you
care so much about standard.

878
00:40:14,731 --> 00:40:15,564
Yeah.
Well,

879
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,280
I love what you said to me at the comedy
store the other night.

880
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,240
He said,
well,

881
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:21,550
I just love standup.
So like I want more.

882
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,200
I want there to be Martin.
Yeah.

883
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,090
I want more people doing standup.
I love it.

884
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,340
I love,
I love.

885
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,220
I love funny shit.

886
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,143
Yeah.
If you're doing standup and people were 

887
00:40:29,911 --> 00:40:31,520
laughing that stand up.
It doesn't.

888
00:40:31,521 --> 00:40:33,170
I don't care if you're a fucking 
surgeon,

889
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,420
you know,
if you're a brain surgeon and he decided

890
00:40:35,421 --> 00:40:37,220
to stand up at night,
are you not a standup?

891
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:41,090
Like once you do stand up comedy to me,
you go onstage,

892
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,160
you tell some jokes,
people laugh.

893
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,800
You're a fucking comic.
You know?

894
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:46,310
I mean,
I don't care if it's an open mic night.

895
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:47,660
You're a comic.
Sure.

896
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,030
He might not be a professional stand up 
comedian.

897
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:50,910
Right?
But if you,

898
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,621
if someone says,
oh,

899
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:52,520
I'm a comic too,
like,

900
00:40:52,521 --> 00:40:54,170
okay,
it doesn't mean you're good.

901
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:54,870
Like,
you know,

902
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,500
like you could,
you could be be a guy who works on cars,

903
00:40:57,501 --> 00:40:58,334
but you just fuck up constantly.
It doesn't make you a professional 

904
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:02,540
mechanic,
you know what I'm saying?

905
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:04,110
Right.
It's like once you.

906
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,770
You're doing it.
We're all doing the same thing.

907
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,890
Thinking suck one dick.
You're a cock sucker.

908
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:10,763
You might not be good at it.
Let me tell you about the way that guy 

909
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:14,270
sucks.
Good taste.

910
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,070
Terrible at it.
I get my dick sucked by a guy one time.

911
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:19,000
I was totally underwhelmed.
Yeah.

912
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,880
Why did that happen?
Was It on purpose?

913
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,910
It started out like I'm a joke now.
It wasn't a joke.

914
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,753
It,
this,

915
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,920
this happened in December of 2002.
And uh,

916
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:37,654
I was,
I was doing a show at the 9:30 club in 

917
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,340
d,
c after the show.

918
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:44,920
There was great blah,
blah,

919
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,820
great place,
fucking waste.

920
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:47,654
And I was really wasted and I had this 
shady manager and he was really wasted 

921
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,373
too.
And he was talking to this person who 

922
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:55,210
appeared to be a hot chick,
right.

923
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,710
Appeared to be a hot chick.
And I was like.

924
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,453
And so I kind of started talking to this
person who appeared to be a hot chick 

925
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:03,104
and,
and rude to the person away from the 

926
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:06,050
shady manager.

927
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,510
And I was feeling really good about it,
you know,

928
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,403
turns out in hindsight that had written,
had we not been so intoxicated it was 

929
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,030
rather evidence,
but we were really intoxicated.

930
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:20,210
So we're walking away from the,
from the 9:30 club,

931
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,103
um,
if that was that of safari or 9:31 of 

932
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:23,594
the two,
but I don't think they have safari 

933
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,910
anymore.
But walking down the street,

934
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,690
going to the next place.
Someone pulls me aside with a,

935
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,540
you know,
a friend pulls me aside and says,

936
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,740
Hey,
just why,

937
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:35,900
you know that,
that person you're talking to.

938
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,020
Um,
was it like a,

939
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,990
not a girl or.
But it wasn't like I would say,

940
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:43,824
uh,
that that person is a road map for a 

941
00:42:46,951 --> 00:42:50,390
diet was what the was described as 
hermaphrodite.

942
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,060
Meaning I get,
you know,

943
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,960
they'd be like,
of both in both women.

944
00:42:53,961 --> 00:42:56,180
And um,
and uh,

945
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:57,014
they did describe that the person had 
had a surgical operation to remove the 

946
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:02,120
male parts.

947
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,380
So it was kind of a chick,
right?

948
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,330
And I was just like,
oh,

949
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:08,164
whatever,
I don't care,

950
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,690
you know,
I was just like,

951
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:12,171
oh,
whatever,

952
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:13,250
you know,
wound up.

953
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,140
I wrote about this in my book.
I'm like,

954
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:19,400
I really had the sense,
you know,

955
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:21,940
I,
I came back to the hotel and,

956
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,340
and um,
and uh,

957
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,203
the,
the sense that I got and this is pretty 

958
00:43:26,721 --> 00:43:28,790
fucking outrageous and take on it was 
that,

959
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,670
here's this person who was,
um,

960
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,130
kind of,
I dunno,

961
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,010
damages and mean word,
but like,

962
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:38,090
you know,
there was something or other,

963
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,210
this person wanted to be loved,
wanting to be accepted.

964
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,850
Now there was something more,
there was some kind of thing.

965
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,120
And I wanted this person to feel,
you know,

966
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,423
and that was kind of where the,
I think that was part of what was going 

967
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:53,510
on.
You know,

968
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,021
I was like,
Hey,

969
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:55,940
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna play ball with this person and

970
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:59,480
we're going to snuggle all night.
And so like,

971
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:01,190
uh,
so then,

972
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:05,000
and that was in the hole in the course 
of the evening,

973
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:08,010
there was,
there was oral sex and um,

974
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,520
a while later,
this is where it gets really crazy.

975
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:12,170
I wasn't doing that.
And it's the show.

976
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:14,930
Dr Drew's loved line shown and talked to
Dr Drew,

977
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,700
Dr. Drew says,
uh,

978
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,350
you know,
I'm paraphrasing,

979
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:19,280
he says,
Steve,

980
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,114
oh,
there's no such thing as a 

981
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:24,140
hermaphrodite.
What happened was a dude,

982
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:26,180
suck your Dick.
Wait a minute.

983
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,120
There's no such thing as Dr. drew told 
me,

984
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,500
uh,
I don't think that's true.

985
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,310
Well,

986
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,870
you know,
and I'm not a doctor,

987
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:34,704
so I probably shouldn't say that she's 
wrong about pot and he's not a potsom 

988
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,360
smoker.
Dr Chu was,

989
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,343
I love Dr. Jew almost more than anybody,
but they bet the first chink in his 

990
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:45,100
armor happened when,
uh,

991
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,430
when I asked him Dr drew,
why,

992
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,910
why is,
uh,

993
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,833
is jerking off so much more pleasurable 
if you tickle your balls while you're 

994
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:57,210
doing it.
And he said,

995
00:44:57,211 --> 00:45:02,211
I didn't know that was the case.
What's think jerks off with his head out

996
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:11,121
the window.
I was like,

997
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,840
how do you thought you knew everything?
What feel good?

998
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,640
It feels good to touch your balls.
Same Way.

999
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,580
The reason why it feels good for other 
people to touch your balls,

1000
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,410
like listen,
Rub your own neck.

1001
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,273
It feels good to rub your own name.
Just like it feels good to get a 

1002
00:45:25,081 --> 00:45:25,990
massage,
right?

1003
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:26,970
Jesus Christ.
Of course.

1004
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:28,920
It feels good to rub your balls with 
dumb answer,

1005
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,930
but since you brought up the magic 
bullet per maphrodite find out.

1006
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:33,783
That's true.
I need to know because I'm pretty sure 

1007
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,503
that it's rare,
but it does exist that there have been 

1008
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:42,960
people that have been born.
I androgynous,

1009
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:45,360
I think is,
is it androgynous?

1010
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,280
Has something.
But uh,

1011
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:52,340
he says hermaphrodite does not exist and
well that doesn't seem to.

1012
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:53,523
He maybe he's just fucking around with 
you and that doesn't seem to make sense 

1013
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:58,620
though because I've talked to because 
that's a medical term.

1014
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,870
I've talked to him about it on many 
occasions,

1015
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,260
but he,
I liked Dr drew,

1016
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,094
I don't want to.
I want to shit on Dr. Joe's was a good 

1017
00:46:06,211 --> 00:46:07,290
guy,
but he fucked up.

1018
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,513
He fucked up when he started talking 
about Hillary Clinton's medical 

1019
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:14,560
condition on the right and they fired 
him from CNN for it and now do that.

1020
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,990
Right?
You can't do that.

1021
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:16,824
You're not.
If you're a doctor and you started 

1022
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,343
talking about someone's medical 
condition without actually appraising 

1023
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:21,084
them physically,
you don't see that in the tabloid 

1024
00:46:22,651 --> 00:46:24,390
magazine.
This doctor commented,

1025
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:26,880
but then they have to clarify that this 
doctor,

1026
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,630
like the person they're talking about 
wasn't never one of their patients.

1027
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,130
She made an assessment about her health.
Right,

1028
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,230
and that's dangerous because you're 
doing it on television.

1029
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:35,730
You're talking about someone who's 
running for president.

1030
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,530
Meanwhile,
look,

1031
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,620
he's right in some ways like she blacked
out,

1032
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:41,463
hit her head,
had brain trauma that Bill Clinton 

1033
00:46:43,381 --> 00:46:46,440
talked about publicly.
Bill Clinton talked about how she was in

1034
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:49,620
recovery for six months from brain 
trauma,

1035
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,573
from having a seizure falling down and 
smashing her head off the ground when 

1036
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:57,870
you're 67 years old or however old she 
was when that happened.

1037
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,350
That's really dangerous.
Like I know a lot about head trauma.

1038
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,420
I've.
I've researched a lot about head trauma.

1039
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,780
I've experienced a bunch of myself,
as I'm sure you have.

1040
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,140
I know you did from Tim Kennedy special.
I talked to you about it afterwards.

1041
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:12,060
I'm like,
I can't let somebody do that to you.

1042
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,390
I know.
I asked her to drop me on my head and he

1043
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,500
dropped me.
He lifted me up by my neck,

1044
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,480
choking me out with my feet off the 
ground,

1045
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,100
and then it let you go,
drop me,

1046
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:20,934
dropped you on your head.
That's so bad for announced like a 

1047
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,940
basset died.
For sure.

1048
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,060
People die from metal and to my soft.
Oh my God.

1049
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:28,800
What's the super,
just super dangerous.

1050
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,183
Like anytime you fall you hit your head.
This is how you have to think about and 

1051
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,520
do that again.
Please don't,

1052
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:34,683
don't think of it as hitting your head.
Think of that as you getting hit by the 

1053
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:38,290
world.
That's what it's like.

1054
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:41,170
The whole world is like slamming into 
your fucking head.

1055
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,580
And I was talking to Tony Hawk about the
cte stuff so bad.

1056
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:46,810
He said that,
uh,

1057
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,660
that if you have a gene

1058
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:50,663
predisposes to Alzheimer's,
then your brain doesn't regenerate or 

1059
00:47:56,491 --> 00:47:57,960
he'll,
you know.

1060
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,240
And um,
and so,

1061
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,330
so,
so you're more,

1062
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,200
you're more at risk for cte if that's 
the case,

1063
00:48:04,201 --> 00:48:06,510
if you had that gene give you don't have
the gene,

1064
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:08,730
then you're better off and you said,
so I've went.

1065
00:48:08,731 --> 00:48:09,564
So I went and got it.
I went and got this test and it 

1066
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,310
determined that I don't have the Jane.
So I was like,

1067
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,090
okay,
cool.

1068
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:17,430
And I thought about it for awhile and 
then I had to text him like,

1069
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:18,700
Hey,
so what were you going

1070
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,940
do if it turned out that you did have 
the gene?

1071
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:21,690
And he's like,
oh,

1072
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,523
I didn't have a plan.
So then I asked myself do I want to go 

1073
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,580
get that test?
Because what happens?

1074
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:29,820
It turns out that you do have the gene 
and there's nothing to do about it.

1075
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,200
You're super bummed out about it.
Bombed.

1076
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,200
Yeah.
Well there's,

1077
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,063
there's ways you can,
I guess you could probably mitigate the 

1078
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:37,014
onset of Alzheimer's now.
I would have to like look at what 

1079
00:48:39,691 --> 00:48:42,660
they're doing now and what we can figure
out and they're working hard at it.

1080
00:48:42,661 --> 00:48:44,830
But yeah man,
it's fucking on that shit.

1081
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,523
I mean the really you need medical 
science to figure out like they have to 

1082
00:48:49,021 --> 00:48:49,854
figure out.
I mean there has to be some pretty 

1083
00:48:51,001 --> 00:48:51,834
legitimate studies and those studies 
take a long time because you have to 

1084
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,164
follow people with Alzheimer's.
You gotta to try one way with one group 

1085
00:48:57,421 --> 00:49:00,180
and another way with another group and 
see like what the,

1086
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,100
you know,
which group has more progress.

1087
00:49:02,101 --> 00:49:05,280
But the bottom line is anytime you're 
getting hit in the head,

1088
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:08,400
it's fucking bad.
Tennis players get,

1089
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,440
get concussions,
you know,

1090
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,780
like people get concussions from playing
soccer,

1091
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:13,823
you know,
who gets brain trauma because it gets 

1092
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,100
really crazy.
People ride jet skis,

1093
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,350
the bouncing of jet skis.

1094
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,240
It shakes your fucking brain inside your
head.

1095
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:24,780
I'm

1096
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,613
thinking of times when I got hit in the 
head hard enough that I actually lost 

1097
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,650
time,
you know,

1098
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:31,930
where like a time traveled because I 
blacked out,

1099
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,370
right?
Like um,

1100
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,800
I got in the ring with a,
the fucking,

1101
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:41,650
the Monday night raw.
The wrestling was so fucking terrible.

1102
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,100
It was so bad because here's the thing,
I was never fucking wrestling fan.

1103
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:46,990
I never got into.
I just didn't understand it.

1104
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,550
And,
and um,

1105
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:52,120
and so like when we got in the fucking 
rang to promote it,

1106
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,180
like we kind of walked through what the 
moves we're going to be,

1107
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:56,303
you know,
with this restaurant who's since passed 

1108
00:49:57,551 --> 00:49:58,384
away,
his name is [inaudible] Maga is fucking 

1109
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:00,491
jacked guy.
They the column,

1110
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:03,160
the Samoan bulldozer.
And uh,

1111
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,293
so we walk through what it was and like 
I'm going to do a back flip off the top 

1112
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,990
rope and he was going to do this and 
we'd been knocked over,

1113
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:12,370
you know,
and it's pretty incredible how they just

1114
00:50:12,371 --> 00:50:14,590
very loosely like walk through every 
horse,

1115
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,740
very loosely choreographed.

1116
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,210
But we know that the moves are and we 
know it's supposed to be the final move.

1117
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,433
What I did not know,
and this was this period we have really 

1118
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:24,880
bad,
is that I did not know that the match is

1119
00:50:24,881 --> 00:50:27,950
not fucking over until you actually play
dead.

1120
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:32,951
You have to be like completely still at 
the end when he was supposed to,

1121
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:33,914
uh,
there was some fucking pretty major hit 

1122
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:40,400
like 10 to my head or to check whatever 
it was.

1123
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:42,800
I can't remember.
But the final hit like in,

1124
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:44,810
in,
in when we're doing it live,

1125
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,450
it was,
he was getting so much fucking harder.

1126
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,440
Oh yeah.
I know what it was.

1127
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:51,030
He jumped off the top rope on and,
and,

1128
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,000
and fuck landed.
I landed on me.

1129
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:56,180
Yeah.
He jumped off the top rope and landed on

1130
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:58,000
the size of that flat.
Oh No.

1131
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,960
Now here's the thing that's supposed to 
be over.

1132
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:06,170
But if you notice I'm fucking not 
playing dead.

1133
00:51:06,171 --> 00:51:10,250
I'm rolling around like I see I'm moving
around,

1134
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,010
moving around.
So here,

1135
00:51:12,011 --> 00:51:16,010
here he notices it supposed to be over.
At this point he's offended because he's

1136
00:51:16,011 --> 00:51:18,380
like,
I'm not now.

1137
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,243
This is not.
This is never supposed to look at this 

1138
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:21,620
elbow.
Boom.

1139
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,150
That knocked me out and I don't remember
anything after that.

1140
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:29,690
So you don't.
I'm begging him.

1141
00:51:29,691 --> 00:51:33,800
I'm praying them.
But the thing is that I'm still throwing

1142
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,490
his world.
It's not over until you play dead.

1143
00:51:37,491 --> 00:51:39,200
But I didn't know that they didn't even 
show the end.

1144
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:40,603
They never say just cut away from it 
because it got so ugly and I don't 

1145
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:44,444
remember leaving the ring.
And then on top of that I went home and 

1146
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:53,110
fucking destroyed my brain some more 
with the Goddamn nitris out.

1147
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:56,850
You know,
you talked to him afterwards to Jamie,

1148
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,140
why don't you fucking crack me in?

1149
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,140
She was cool with me.
I went back,

1150
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,633
I went back to a and worked my way in.
I was like with my video camera trying 

1151
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:08,120
to get him to fucking choke me 
unconscious.

1152
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,003
Like,
like Tim Kennedy did know I wanted to 

1153
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:12,470
film that for a thing and he was totally
down.

1154
00:52:12,471 --> 00:52:15,170
But then like they got hip to what I was
doing.

1155
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:16,004
They're like,
and all the wwe Bras I kinda came and 

1156
00:52:18,651 --> 00:52:21,140
gotten kicked out.
He was cool with me.

1157
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:21,591
But,
but yeah,

1158
00:52:21,591 --> 00:52:25,070
that that's offensive to a wrestler to 
get in there and play in their world and

1159
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:27,800
not like.
Because when I,

1160
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:31,010
when I get hit really hard,
like to me like I react,

1161
00:52:31,011 --> 00:52:31,850
I laughed,
you know,

1162
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:34,010
like whatever.
Like it's a thing and I,

1163
00:52:34,011 --> 00:52:34,844
you know,
like I'm reacting to it and that was 

1164
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:37,724
offensive to him.
It has to be final and us be over that 

1165
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:44,570
elbow to the head was the fucking or can
imagine that was giant dude.

1166
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,493
Yeah.
After what happened and how did he pass 

1167
00:52:47,121 --> 00:52:48,800
away?
I think he had a heart attack.

1168
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,930
He'd be bad.
Yeah.

1169
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:53,050
That guy was great.
I got a lot of those um,

1170
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,180
wrestlers they get hooked on pills 
because they're in prime time.

1171
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,193
It's a big problem with pro wrestling.
Wrestling is one of the most 

1172
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:05,210
unappreciated or under appreciated 
things in terms of like how difficult it

1173
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:08,690
is for the performers was one of the 
most difficult jobs a person could do.

1174
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,090
Those guys are on tour hundreds of days 
a year,

1175
00:53:11,091 --> 00:53:12,740
if not 300 days a year.
Right.

1176
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,710
They're constantly on the road and 
they're doing that all the time.

1177
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:18,830
They're slamming into each other,
throwing each other on the ground,

1178
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:20,870
pile driving each other,
slamming,

1179
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,790
jumping from the top rope.
I get it,

1180
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:24,110
man.
Massive,

1181
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:26,100
massive trauma.
Those

1182
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,460
guys all suffer from some kind of trauma
for sure.

1183
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:33,020
Yeah.
That was a heavy blackout.

1184
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,080
And um,
I,

1185
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:34,973
I can think of a few times where I just 
blacked out because I hit my head so 

1186
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:38,034
hard and then there's other times where 
I hit my head and then starting the 

1187
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:45,060
nausea kicks in and start barfing.
That happened when I was 10 years old.

1188
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:47,160
Well,
you probably got a lot of brain damage,

1189
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:48,250
bro.
Yeah.

1190
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:52,290
And what's fucked up about is that it 
doesn't affect me now,

1191
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:54,300
but that's just creeping up on me for 
later.

1192
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,850
Well,
it definitely affects me now.

1193
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,770
It's just like,
how much does it affect you?

1194
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,500
It's like you ever wake up,
I'm sure you've broken up,

1195
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:02,460
hung over,
and you're like,

1196
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:03,900
Oh God,
I feel like Shit.

1197
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,500
Well that's how you feel because what 
you did to your body,

1198
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:10,780
but if that's how you felt every day,
you would just get used to that.

1199
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:12,660
That's,
that would be who you are.

1200
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:13,853
And when you fuck your brain up with.
The weird thing is you never go back to 

1201
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,653
how you used to feel.
It's not like you can hit a switch and 

1202
00:54:20,881 --> 00:54:22,530
you go,
how was I when I was 18?

1203
00:54:22,531 --> 00:54:24,330
And I had never been hitting the head,
let me hit this switch,

1204
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:25,200
Click,
oh,

1205
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:27,630
so much clarity that that's not 
available.

1206
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:31,610
So you just deal with how you are,
like you ever wake up in the morning and

1207
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,080
you just feel kind of stupid.
You can't forget where your keys are.

1208
00:54:34,081 --> 00:54:35,790
What am I supposed to do today?
You just feel dull.

1209
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,050
Everybody's been there,
right?

1210
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,010
Because field,
dull.

1211
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:40,050
Maybe she'll jet lagged like,
you know,

1212
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:43,380
jet lag.
I just kept saying I feel tired.

1213
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,940
I'm always fucking tired right now.
That just in general because um,

1214
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,593
and,
and I wonder if that's it because that 

1215
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,910
was a factor for sure.

1216
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,050
I got on the Vegan Diet,
right?

1217
00:54:55,051 --> 00:54:55,884
And I remember a while,
a while until I started feeling fucking 

1218
00:54:59,251 --> 00:54:59,941
tired and I,
it's like,

1219
00:54:59,941 --> 00:55:01,830
man,
it's got to be my fucking Vegan Diet and

1220
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:02,664
pissed,
you know?

1221
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,820
And then there was a point where I said,
fuck the Vegan Diet,

1222
00:55:05,821 --> 00:55:06,654
I'm going to eat fish again and eggs,
but it's still tired and I was still 

1223
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:13,000
fucking ever get your blood work done.
Um,

1224
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,280
I should,
I should,

1225
00:55:14,281 --> 00:55:14,841
I do.
I mean,

1226
00:55:14,841 --> 00:55:17,490
I get,
I get like full panel everything you do.

1227
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:21,330
I mean as far as like for like stds and 
shit,

1228
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:22,440
I'm like,
no,

1229
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,990
you right,
you should go to a doctor that can check

1230
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:27,780
out your nutritional profile and they 
might do that.

1231
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,790
Yeah.
They might say you're deficient on iron.

1232
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,630
It could be like a nice to have that,
like that.

1233
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:37,470
Tell me that my testosterone is low.
My vitamin D,

1234
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:39,360
a lot of that also comes from brain 
damage.

1235
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,240
Oh yeah.
Testosterone being low as a bigger issue

1236
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:44,190
with football players,
fighters.

1237
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,383
Um,
your pituitary gland is very sensitive 

1238
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:47,544
and that's one of the things that 
happens with people literally just from 

1239
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:50,390
jet skiing.
Like I was saying,

1240
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,233
skiing in general,
like jumping ski jumps and stuff like 

1241
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:56,040
that.
Even without even get get getting hit in

1242
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:56,874
the head,
which is anything that causes your head 

1243
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:00,144
to shake around a lot.
Like I'm sure headbanging like ACDC and 

1244
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:07,370
say I went to the fucking Chiropractor,
I've been to chiropractors and you know,

1245
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:10,100
I'll go to the chiropractor and they're 
familiar with Jack Ass and shit.

1246
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:11,820
I've done and,
and yeah,

1247
00:56:11,821 --> 00:56:14,910
they'll like take my uh,
my x ray to look at my,

1248
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,040
at my spine and they're like,
dude,

1249
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:20,250
I don't understand it.
Like you're like fucking Keith Richards,

1250
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,050
you know,
like there's,

1251
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:21,883
there's like getting much,
much better shape than I expected you 

1252
00:56:24,671 --> 00:56:25,504
would be in,
except for in my neck where I've got 

1253
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:29,800
the,
what do they call it,

1254
00:56:29,801 --> 00:56:33,610
the cad callous or are not callous.

1255
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:34,960
The,
I don't know,

1256
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:37,580
some kind of fucking build up.
Um,

1257
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:42,820
and then calcium deposits or.
Oh,

1258
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:45,040
Jesus,
he gets her head banging.

1259
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,390
Yeah.
Some kind of.

1260
00:56:46,391 --> 00:56:49,240
So you have some disc degeneration,
some sort of deterioration.

1261
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:50,321
Yeah.
Anyway,

1262
00:56:50,321 --> 00:56:51,154
whatever it is,
it's my neck is more fucked up than 

1263
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:53,644
anything.
And so then there's more of that super 

1264
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:57,400
skeptical of chiropractors.
By the way,

1265
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,300
I'm not a big fan either.
I just heard too many regular doctors.

1266
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:02,800
So that's just horse shit,
right.

1267
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:05,530
I went to a,
it got to a point where I was like,

1268
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:06,221
fuck,
you know,

1269
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:08,020
and,
and I was doing some job,

1270
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:09,423
um,
I was getting ready to do some job and 

1271
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:13,390
you know,
you go to this side physician,

1272
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:16,420
he'd say,
clear to you before you can be on,

1273
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:17,283
like of work a TV or a movie job.
Go to this fucking physician to the 

1274
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:23,890
stars who just did their own and she's 
shining a light down my throat.

1275
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,150
And she says,
hmm.

1276
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,020
Um,
the,

1277
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,043
the,
the opening at the back of your throat 

1278
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:31,020
is very narrow diy,
like,

1279
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,030
do you ever find that you sleep a full 
night sleep,

1280
00:57:34,031 --> 00:57:36,910
but you wake up and you're still tired?
I was like,

1281
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,780
Jesus Christ,
that's exactly fucking me.

1282
00:57:38,781 --> 00:57:41,440
You know,
I'll sleep for eight hours,

1283
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:43,480
nine hours.
I get up fucking tired.

1284
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,800
Sleep apnea.
Yeah.

1285
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:47,020
So she said,
I recommend you get a sleep study.

1286
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,370
Did you do it?
I did.

1287
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:49,263
I got to say,
they said I have a mild to moderate 

1288
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,650
sleep apnea.
Super Common.

1289
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:55,120
You know,
you get a mouthpiece to fix that.

1290
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:56,320
I,
now I got to you,

1291
00:57:56,321 --> 00:58:01,321
but I already have a mouthpiece.
Fortunately for you,

1292
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:05,350
it fits on the bottom,
on the bottom,

1293
00:58:05,351 --> 00:58:06,184
and what it does is as a tongue 
depressor and it presses down your 

1294
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:09,970
tongue,
the tongue from sliding back.

1295
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,770
I'd right here.
I have a buddy of mine that,

1296
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:12,650
that fixed everything.

1297
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,860
I know God does it to.
I have to do that immediately.

1298
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,790
It's,
um,

1299
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,930
there's a doctor in Encino,
Dr Kirby and who was famous for it.

1300
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

1301
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:28,750
It's um,
it's super common like sleep apnea,

1302
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,200
people with big tongues.
Your tongue as you laid back,

1303
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:33,034
especially if you lay on your back,
it falls back and covers over your air 

1304
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:36,550
hole.
Right.

1305
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,000
That's what causes a lot of gagging and 
loud snoring,

1306
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,820
you know.
But it's a huge issue for people.

1307
00:58:42,821 --> 00:58:44,510
And that's c pap machine,
man mean.

1308
00:58:44,511 --> 00:58:45,920
Some people need to have it.
Me,

1309
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,050
I did,
I tried it,

1310
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:48,103
I tried,
I tried it for awhile and I was able to 

1311
00:58:50,201 --> 00:58:53,440
fall asleep.
But then about an hour or two into it,

1312
00:58:53,441 --> 00:58:54,640
the fuck,
they just blowing,

1313
00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:56,430
blowing me away and wakes me up and 
there's.

1314
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,560
And there's,
I couldn't fucking do.

1315
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,413
It's too weird.
You're sleeping with darth vader mascot 

1316
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:02,743
is.
It's too weird for really fat people 

1317
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:06,334
though.
It's huge and the extent that you have 

1318
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:12,180
to clean that fucking thing.
And speaking of family pieces,

1319
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,290
easy.
What do we go from there though?

1320
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:15,124
We,
we started out with some sort of 

1321
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,000
reporting we would.
We're talking about Al Madrigal and then

1322
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:22,130
we got on dudes sucking dude's Dick.
Then we got

1323
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,120
onto the head drama.

1324
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,510
We have an important thing to say about 
head trauma.

1325
00:59:25,511 --> 00:59:29,750
Like what did we start off?
It was just that it's Kinda bad to,

1326
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:33,070
you know,
being tired.

1327
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,113
Yeah.
If,

1328
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,780
I mean guarantee you that has something 
to do with why your testosterone is low.

1329
00:59:37,781 --> 00:59:38,561
Also,
you know,

1330
00:59:38,561 --> 00:59:41,620
another thing that has to do with how 
many like healthy fats,

1331
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:42,843
how much healthy fat in your diet,
because fats and even cholesterol are 

1332
00:59:46,721 --> 00:59:50,170
literally the precursors for hormones.
It's like how your body,

1333
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:53,830
like one of the things that people find 
when they go on a heavy fat based diet,

1334
00:59:53,831 --> 00:59:56,160
like a key to genic diet is,
um,

1335
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,000
they are hormones.
Jump Up.

1336
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,820
It's because your body,
that's how your body makes hormones.

1337
01:00:00,821 --> 01:00:04,000
Your body uses fats and cholesterol 
actually to make hormones.

1338
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,510
Now when you say healthy fats like 
Avocados,

1339
01:00:06,511 --> 01:00:07,344
coconut oil,
avocado is interesting because it's a 

1340
01:00:09,281 --> 01:00:13,780
combination of a saturated fat and 
uncheck trade fat and most people assume

1341
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:16,720
that saturated fat is bad for you,
but it's not.

1342
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:19,490
A lot of that came out of the sugar 
industry that you're.

1343
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,520
Your fucking dad was probably a part of 
the sugar industry paid off and this was

1344
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:25,563
from the New York Times and a bunch of 
like really reputable newspapers 

1345
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:29,080
reported on this.
Really recently.

1346
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:30,213
The sugar industry paid off scientists 
to lie about the effects of saturated 

1347
01:00:34,691 --> 01:00:35,524
fats to cover up the effects of sugar.
It's really sad because so many people 

1348
01:00:38,921 --> 01:00:39,754
to this day running around worrying 
about saturated fat and not worrying 

1349
01:00:43,061 --> 01:00:43,894
about sugar because they're worried 
about saturated fat in their diet and 

1350
01:00:46,301 --> 01:00:48,730
that's what made people switch over to 
shit like margarine,

1351
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,790
which are terrible for you.
Didn't even recommend margin anymore.

1352
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,880
That's how trans fats get introduced 
into people's terrible.

1353
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,330
They're trying to make them illegal and 
they've made them illegal in America,

1354
01:00:58,331 --> 01:01:01,270
but they still have like another year or
so where you're allowed to sell it,

1355
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,283
which is hilarious.
They give these companies an extra year 

1356
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,460
or two to get rid of all the bullshit 
that they,

1357
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:08,294
they,
they made so that they can still fuck 

1358
01:01:10,421 --> 01:01:12,970
people over for 12 months and make 
money.

1359
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,660
They knew that that stuff was bad for 
you decades ago and they just,

1360
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:18,160
they've been like la La,
La,

1361
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:19,023
not listening.

1362
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,400
Damn.
Diane didn't tell you this story about,

1363
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:23,930
uh,
about my dad Kay.

1364
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,250
So when I was 12 I moved to Toronto,
right.

1365
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:29,860
Living in Canada.
Dad was the president of Nabisco,

1366
01:01:29,861 --> 01:01:32,370
Canada and I was,
speaking of head,

1367
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:36,340
I was a fucking rabid motley crue fan.
Right?

1368
01:01:36,341 --> 01:01:39,070
I fucking loved Motley crew.
This was 1987.

1369
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:42,670
Shout of the right now this is that are 
girls,

1370
01:01:42,671 --> 01:01:43,570
girls,
girls tour,

1371
01:01:43,571 --> 01:01:44,404
right?
I mean I got fucking Motley crue all 

1372
01:01:45,311 --> 01:01:47,980
over my bedroom walls and fucking crazy 
about these fucking guys.

1373
01:01:47,981 --> 01:01:51,880
Now they come to uh,
to Toronto for their girls,

1374
01:01:51,881 --> 01:01:52,720
girls,
girls tour.

1375
01:01:52,721 --> 01:01:56,870
They're doing maple leaf gardens and I,
the day before the concert,

1376
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:58,930
well I should say my dad knew that would
a big fan.

1377
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:03,100
I wasn't the Bisco Canada had a sky box 
in the arena,

1378
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:04,323
but my dad also knew that,
that nobody from Nabisco gave a fuck 

1379
01:02:08,081 --> 01:02:09,340
about a motley crue concerts.

1380
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,890
The skybox was going to be empty.
So my dad,

1381
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,210
my dad said to me,
he said,

1382
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,790
had no,
I'm and she loved Motley crue and so I'm

1383
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:20,010
going to bring you to the concert.
We can sit in the Dubiski skybox and I'd

1384
01:02:20,011 --> 01:02:20,844
tell my dad,
dad watching Motley crue through a 

1385
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:24,570
plate,
glass window sucks.

1386
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,640
And he says,
and he says,

1387
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:27,474
all right,
well,

1388
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,830
you know,
basically fuck you,

1389
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:29,341
you know,
he's like,

1390
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:30,174
if you can do better and then we'll do 
better with then we'll use your tickets 

1391
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:34,230
if you can,
you know,

1392
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,060
fucking.
I was 13,

1393
01:02:36,061 --> 01:02:36,894
you know,
so the day before the concert I see on 

1394
01:02:39,601 --> 01:02:41,430
the news,
they're like complaining.

1395
01:02:41,431 --> 01:02:42,264
They're like,
these fucking asshole rockstars come to 

1396
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:45,870
our city and fucking fuck around like 
one way or another.

1397
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:46,771
And I'm like,
dude,

1398
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:48,620
they're here.
The fucking molly quit.

1399
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,170
What would he say?
Rockstar?

1400
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:54,840
They made the news for something like 
blush.

1401
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,080
I forget what it was.
I think they started some kind of fire,

1402
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:59,990
it's something created,
but they were on the news and the like,

1403
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:03,900
they were complaining to these fucking 
guys come here and so I'm like,

1404
01:03:03,901 --> 01:03:04,734
they're in Toronto,
they're in the city now and the fucking 

1405
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,173
concert tomorrow.
So I deduce that they're in a hotel and 

1406
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,740
I'm going to fucking find these guys.
I want to fuck.

1407
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,470
I was 13 and so I go fucking running to 
my room.

1408
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,313
Right.
Like right away I'm thinking I know all 

1409
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:23,280
the guys and I know their real names 
like Vince Neil is Vincent Wharton,

1410
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:24,503
right.
Like I know all their names and I'm 

1411
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:26,184
like,
I couldn't fucking check into the hotel 

1412
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:32,130
as Frank Carlton Ferranto right.
That's Nikki Sixx.

1413
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,600
They're not going to use their real 
names.

1414
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:34,434
And I was like,
they're going to check into the hotel 

1415
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:36,570
under the name of their manager.

1416
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:37,883
Right.
And then I guess just go right into my 

1417
01:03:40,201 --> 01:03:44,970
room and I fucking check on my little 
cassette fucking album sleeves and check

1418
01:03:44,971 --> 01:03:46,650
everyone.
It says doc mcgee,

1419
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,990
which was their manager at Doc Mcgee.
So I'm like,

1420
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,700
that's the fucking one I go run into.
Uh,

1421
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:52,940
the,
the,

1422
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,520
the phone book and the fucking opening 
up the hotel,

1423
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,473
like the yellow pages and I districts 
are calling every fucking hotel in the 

1424
01:04:00,151 --> 01:04:02,660
yellow pages and when the hotel answers 
and like,

1425
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,533
will you please put me through to Mr 
Mcgee's room right in the fucking show 

1426
01:04:07,601 --> 01:04:08,434
was like a Sunday instead of Saturday.
And my dad's like watching college 

1427
01:04:10,621 --> 01:04:11,454
football,
right.

1428
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,533
I'm sitting on the phone call and every 
fucking hotel in Toronto who's going 

1429
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:17,460
down the list,
not even calling the ones with the ads,

1430
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:20,010
like literally just sticking to the list
so I don't miss one.

1431
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:22,380
And my mom's pissed because there was no
call waiting.

1432
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,820
She's like,
you're tying up the house phone.

1433
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:25,643
My Dad,
all my dad ever wanted was for me to 

1434
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:30,030
show initiative and to be like,
motivated for something,

1435
01:04:30,031 --> 01:04:32,100
you know.
And so my dad's like super still,

1436
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,480
I'm on fire.
I'm telling my mom,

1437
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,360
mom called Motley crue fucking and my 
dad,

1438
01:04:36,361 --> 01:04:37,920
my calls off my mom,
you know,

1439
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:39,570
like honey,
like let him do his thing.

1440
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,900
And I fucking sat there for probably two
or three hours.

1441
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:46,260
There's calling hotels and get.
They put me through to this room.

1442
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,330
There was one like false alarm,
you know,

1443
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,433
but then the second nicky's room that I 
got through to the guy picks up the 

1444
01:04:52,531 --> 01:04:55,440
phone and I said,
hello,

1445
01:04:55,441 --> 01:04:56,730
is that Dr Mcgee?
And he says,

1446
01:04:56,731 --> 01:04:58,890
no,
this is [inaudible] brother Scott.

1447
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,650
He's and I'm like,
as in Motley crue.

1448
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:02,970
And he says,
uh,

1449
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:04,590
he says,
how did you get this number?

1450
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:05,401
And I told him,
I fuck,

1451
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,140
I just call it every fucking hotel in 
the yellow painted.

1452
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:08,490
I just told them,
I said,

1453
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:10,440
I just called every hotel in the yellow 
pages.

1454
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:12,530
Is the crew there?
And,

1455
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:13,710
and,
and he goes,

1456
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:14,630
he goes,
Whoa,

1457
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:15,930
wait,
hold on a second.

1458
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,970
Are you fucking kidding me?
That's awesome.

1459
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:20,450
And he says,
uh,

1460
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,630
he goes,
I'm so impressed by what you did.

1461
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:23,860
And he says,
he says,

1462
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:27,970
how would you like it if I put you on 
the list for backstage passes and I can,

1463
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,250
I can give you tickets in the fifth 
road.

1464
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:32,260
So he gave me two tickets in the fifth 
row.

1465
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:33,393
Fucking backstage passes.
My Dad and my went fucking show for my 

1466
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:39,190
dad's a chauffeur to the fucking maple 
leaf gardens.

1467
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:41,610
We've gotten the fucking press lined 
with the FEC.

1468
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,320
Fifth row,
fifth row.

1469
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:44,223
It's insane.
That's actually better than the first 

1470
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:45,670
row.

1471
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:46,503
You're like a back on.
It was the dope because I was fucking 

1472
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:54,871
head bay like a magic kit myself.
Hell of brain damage that he did like a.

1473
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:01,710
How are you not showing me with fucking 
Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee's picture?

1474
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:02,331
No,
no,

1475
01:06:02,331 --> 01:06:02,711
no,
no.

1476
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:03,544
But Google.
Steven fucking Steve and Motley crue 

1477
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:08,740
man.
When you were 13.

1478
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:12,600
I was fucking 13.
We went up to the sky box and I put my,

1479
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,620
my,
my ghetto blaster.

1480
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:15,663
Fuck.
I put my ghetto blaster next to the 

1481
01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:20,080
little speaker deal and there's me and 
Tommy Lee.

1482
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,360
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

1483
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,940
And then uh,
and seeing how old is Tommy Lee?

1484
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,640
I got,
that's crazy.

1485
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:29,950
Me and Nikki sixx right there.
You're like a bb.

1486
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:33,070
I was a fucking baby dude.
That is so weird.

1487
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:33,911
Yeah.
And you know,

1488
01:06:33,911 --> 01:06:35,980
I'm standing next to these guys and I'm 
like,

1489
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:38,230
I don't have fucking,
you know,

1490
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:41,410
like shit to talk to them about,
but the fact that I was standing next to

1491
01:06:41,411 --> 01:06:42,910
those guys and I was like,
you know what,

1492
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,073
I'm here backstage with my fucking 
heroes and it's because I fucking 

1493
01:06:47,381 --> 01:06:48,214
decided so you know,
like there's something about that that 

1494
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:53,020
gave me this,
this,

1495
01:06:53,021 --> 01:06:53,890
this and mentality.

1496
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:54,490
And they see,
look,

1497
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:56,610
top left right there,
check it out.

1498
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:57,483
Fucking all these years later when they,
when they announced that they're back 

1499
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:03,040
together and going on their carnival of 
sins tour,

1500
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,490
Tommy Lee asked me to do something 
fucked up and introduce them.

1501
01:07:06,491 --> 01:07:07,660
Dude.
How full circle.

1502
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:08,543
Wow.
That's crazy data was the dopest as the 

1503
01:07:12,741 --> 01:07:15,550
dude on the far right.
That's mcmorris with the hat.

1504
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,820
Yeah.
He's got like a generative bone disease.

1505
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,380
What's going on with them?
Yeah.

1506
01:07:20,381 --> 01:07:21,670
Like,
I forget what it's called,

1507
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:22,630
but uh,
yeah,

1508
01:07:22,631 --> 01:07:24,850
he's like,
they got to like have them come out when

1509
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:27,890
the lights aren't on leg,
you know,

1510
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,010
or I don't know,
maybe he's doing better at it.

1511
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:32,800
Limps gay.
He's in rough shape.

1512
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,100
Brianna,
I love that story,

1513
01:07:36,101 --> 01:07:37,420
man,
and my dad,

1514
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:40,090
you know,
it was like my kind of how my dad is.

1515
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,350
That's awesome man.
Yeah,

1516
01:07:42,351 --> 01:07:43,380
dude,
it's a great story.

1517
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,211
Well,
thank you man.

1518
01:07:44,211 --> 01:07:46,600
It made,
it really made me into a monster in some

1519
01:07:46,601 --> 01:07:50,080
regard because I think that at that 
young age it's like,

1520
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:53,410
you know,
I really can fucking,

1521
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:54,400
you know,
if you just.

1522
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,130
And I've always said,
it doesn't matter what people want,

1523
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:59,650
it just mattered how bad they really put
them on.

1524
01:07:59,651 --> 01:08:00,484
And I mean,
of course they definitely matters what 

1525
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:03,210
they want.
You want to play basketball against,

1526
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:07,500
of course within some.
But I want it right,

1527
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:08,343
of course,
within,

1528
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:11,950
within some parameters of reality.
But,

1529
01:08:11,951 --> 01:08:14,410
but a factor,
what do they say they say that,

1530
01:08:14,411 --> 01:08:16,060
uh,
that uh,

1531
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,190
luck is when preparation meets 
opportunity.

1532
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,350
Yes.
Which is dope.

1533
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:23,270
I love her.
I love that fucking saying.

1534
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,553
Yeah,
there's a lot of variables and you can 

1535
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:27,080
control some of them.
Right.

1536
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:28,293
And you definitely saw some of them,
like with like with fucking standup and 

1537
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:35,510
at a really wanted,
he brought up our magic.

1538
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,520
I'm all,
I'm going to say this quickly,

1539
01:08:37,521 --> 01:08:39,920
I don't want to be careful not to lynch 
the guy because you know,

1540
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:41,630
I'd like a dyke.
I don't want everyone's at all.

1541
01:08:41,631 --> 01:08:43,850
Fuck that guy from,
from everything.

1542
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:46,280
I understand.
He's hilarious and great guy.

1543
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,050
He's a great guy.
He's hilarious.

1544
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:50,900
And you should absolutely check out as 
comedy special on the show time,

1545
01:08:50,901 --> 01:08:53,860
which is called shrimping.
Ain't easy to decide for yourself.

1546
01:08:53,861 --> 01:08:55,190
Is this guy fucking funny?
Yes.

1547
01:08:55,191 --> 01:08:56,240
He's very,
very funny.

1548
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:58,670
He's very funny.
Not ever met the guy.

1549
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,550
I didn't know shit about him but.
But um,

1550
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:03,590
and this was,
this was a,

1551
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:06,740
was it 2012 or 2000?
13.

1552
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:11,690
I had been headline in comedy clubs 
since 2010.

1553
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:12,643
You know,
I had got into it and I've been doing 

1554
01:09:14,841 --> 01:09:16,490
standup for seven years now.
Yeah,

1555
01:09:16,491 --> 01:09:17,324
well technically it's been,
it's been almost 11 years since the 

1556
01:09:19,791 --> 01:09:22,190
first time I ever tried it,
which was a,

1557
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:27,191
at the laugh factory when skyler stone 
in 2006 asked me to do a stunt at the,

1558
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:31,430
at the laugh factory because he was 
hosting a show and he wants to,

1559
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,750
you know,
so I'm like,

1560
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:33,830
yeah,
I'll do a fucking stunt,

1561
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:34,340
like whatever.

1562
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:36,650
And I showed up.
I had no game plan when I walked in.

1563
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,750
Just as I said,
I said I can't,

1564
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:39,623
there's nothing fucking crazier than me 
getting on stage trying to make people 

1565
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:43,550
laugh.
That's the stuff that was,

1566
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:46,280
I was terrified.
So I tried it that night,

1567
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:47,593
but I never got like really hardcore 
like in earnest and so 2000 who'd 

1568
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:51,683
started 2010 now 2012,
2013 amount of point where I'm super 

1569
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:59,300
comfortable in my,
in my 45 minutes,

1570
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:00,134
right.
Like my whatever my hour is at that 

1571
01:10:01,851 --> 01:10:02,684
point.
My like I'm just really comfortable in 

1572
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:05,234
it and I'm starting to feel like stale 
because I'm fucking going through the 

1573
01:10:08,031 --> 01:10:10,340
motions and the shit.
Like,

1574
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,260
uh,
you know what that's like writing,

1575
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:13,323
you get to a point where you're just 
like fucking with dying because I'm not 

1576
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,020
doing anything new,
not doing anything new.

1577
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,041
And,
and,

1578
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:19,701
uh,
and,

1579
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:22,100
and,
and the worst is if is,

1580
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,980
if you'd go back to a fucking place and 
do the same material,

1581
01:10:24,981 --> 01:10:25,814
that's the,
you know,

1582
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,370
and I don't,
I don't ever want to fucking do that.

1583
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:29,541
I,
so,

1584
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:32,110
so I'm like a kid,
uh,

1585
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,820
my comfort zone and I got to get out of 
it,

1586
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:36,650
but I ended up at,
but I just wasn't doing it.

1587
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,480
As I finally put my,
put my foot down,

1588
01:10:38,481 --> 01:10:39,260
I said,
fuck it.

1589
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,550
Okay,
this is what I'm doing.

1590
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:43,760
I'm promising myself,
I'm going to go do 10 minutes,

1591
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:47,970
10 minute set here in La and,
and even if I have to,

1592
01:10:47,971 --> 01:10:52,460
I put it on my calendar for one week 
later and even if I have to bomb,

1593
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:54,890
I'm not backing out period.
I'm going,

1594
01:10:54,891 --> 01:10:56,330
I'm doing 10,
20 minutes.

1595
01:10:56,510 --> 01:11:00,200
And I wrote fucking 10.
I wrote a fucking set and I went over to

1596
01:11:00,201 --> 01:11:02,060
the laugh factory and I did it and I was
thrilled.

1597
01:11:02,061 --> 01:11:03,320
I got some laughs,
you know,

1598
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:07,670
then I go over to the fucking the Improv
and I'm like,

1599
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:08,160
Hey,
you know,

1600
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,730
and I made the mistake,
it was a mistake where I say,

1601
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:11,960
Hey,
I'm working on some new material.

1602
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,430
You never say that when you're on new 
material to the audience.

1603
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:15,751
Right.
But,

1604
01:11:15,751 --> 01:11:17,070
but I mentioned it.
Say Hey,

1605
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:19,560
or maybe I did it and then I said,
hey guys,

1606
01:11:19,561 --> 01:11:21,270
thanks.
You know that like I was trying some new

1607
01:11:21,271 --> 01:11:23,370
material and then thanks for,
you know,

1608
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:26,520
and I diligently recorded the fucking 
set to play it back.

1609
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:28,410
And here were the last word,
you know,

1610
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:31,130
like I wrote my own shit.
I went there and I fucking did,

1611
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:34,500
didn't do shit and I worked it out and I
recorded it and you know,

1612
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:36,090
that's how you do it.
Well,

1613
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:40,320
when I get off the stage and I'm 
thrilled because of fucking people left,

1614
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,910
you know,
and I sit in the crowd,

1615
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,630
I sit in the crowd,
the host brings up the next comment,

1616
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:47,850
next comic is Allah magical.
He walks out and he goes,

1617
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,880
oh my God,
what did we just see?

1618
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:56,060
We just saw steevo working on new 
material.

1619
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:59,780
I just,
and he's just like,

1620
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,180
I just,
I just can't take it anymore.

1621
01:12:03,181 --> 01:12:07,140
Like I just,
I just can't believe that,

1622
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,023
you know,
that,

1623
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,960
that,
this thing that,

1624
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:10,794
that I consider my calling in life,
standup comedy that I care about it so 

1625
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:19,791
much.
And now we have Steve and Dustin diamond

1626
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,590
out here doing this thing.
It's like,

1627
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:23,424
I can't believe that these people are 
taking something that's so sacred to me 

1628
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:32,640
and just using it as their last resort.
And I'm sitting right there watching him

1629
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:34,050
say this shit.
I'm like,

1630
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:37,050
what the fuck?
Like,

1631
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:38,550
what the fuck are you doing?
Dude?

1632
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,393
It was just an odd.
There was a blatant attack from the 

1633
01:12:41,311 --> 01:12:42,144
stage,
you know?

1634
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:44,130
And I'm like,
I'm like,

1635
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:48,270
it's not fucking right because a 
motherfuckers were laughing,

1636
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,280
you know,
I played it back and be like,

1637
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,860
I got in the car right after that,
you know why we're.

1638
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,570
And I sat there,
I couldn't even believe it.

1639
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:56,790
And then there's,
there was a lady that was talking at our

1640
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:59,460
table and he just went in on her like 
beyond,

1641
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,220
beyond what was like,
what was like,

1642
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:03,060
Hey,
be quiet,

1643
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:03,894
you know,
start with starting in with like the 

1644
01:13:04,621 --> 01:13:06,860
personal,
like whatever.

1645
01:13:06,861 --> 01:13:07,694
And I don't even care.
But what I perceived was that here's a 

1646
01:13:10,441 --> 01:13:13,440
guy who's claiming that his whole 
passionate standup comedy,

1647
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,290
but his whole attack on me and then 
berating the woman.

1648
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:19,080
There weren't any jokes,
you know,

1649
01:13:19,081 --> 01:13:19,914
like it was almost like he just four 
went the act of performing comedy to 

1650
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,760
kind of be mean to me because he was 
upset that you were doing standup.

1651
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:28,730
He's upset that I was doing standup and,
and,

1652
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:29,401
and,
and,

1653
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:30,330
and,
and whatever.

1654
01:13:30,331 --> 01:13:34,260
But then then after his set and he went 
in and started selling drugs after that.

1655
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,093
But after his set,
he comes over to the booth and I'm 

1656
01:13:36,901 --> 01:13:39,720
sitting right next to the sound booth,
said right next to it.

1657
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:40,613
And he comes over and says something to 
the sound guy and kind of awkwardly 

1658
01:13:42,631 --> 01:13:43,464
notices I'm sitting right there.
And then he comes over and leans over 

1659
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,210
the table and he says,
just so you know,

1660
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:52,530
what you're doing isn't taken lately,
like face to face.

1661
01:13:52,531 --> 01:13:55,950
I felt like he totally insulted me just 
so you know,

1662
01:13:55,951 --> 01:14:00,390
what you're doing isn't taken lightly.
Like I don't even know what it meant,

1663
01:14:00,391 --> 01:14:03,170
but I bet it was clear that the,
that the sentiment was like.

1664
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,680
And I meant everything.
I said,

1665
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:05,603
you know,
I felt like he came in and assaulted me 

1666
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:09,650
to my face on top of that and I was 
just,

1667
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,790
I was pretty bent out of shape about it,
but I didn't like say anything or,

1668
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,653
you know,
and I certainly wouldn't have come here 

1669
01:14:15,371 --> 01:14:19,810
to talk about that like at all except 
what was it?

1670
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:22,420
I was on here a couple weeks ago and 
like I,

1671
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:23,443
I see in my twitter feed my,
like my name is tagged and it says 

1672
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:31,510
listen to the podcast Douche.
And I'm like,

1673
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,970
Huh.
And I'm like okay.

1674
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:37,270
So.
So Al was on the Joe Rogan podcast and I

1675
01:14:37,271 --> 01:14:38,104
guess he's telling me to listen to it.
And then there was more like Brendan 

1676
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:44,280
Schaub replied and they're all playing 
nice and I just plugged.

1677
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:47,140
So I started listening to the album 
magical thing and he's,

1678
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,240
and he like ran out of the gate.
He's saying like,

1679
01:14:49,241 --> 01:14:50,074
Oh man,
I have this habit where I like kind of 

1680
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,473
create problems.
I just said I'd talk shit on people and 

1681
01:14:55,091 --> 01:14:55,924
I create beefs and it's really 
counterproductive and I should work on 

1682
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,131
it and I'd,
you know,

1683
01:15:00,131 --> 01:15:04,210
like it's not a good thing.
And he basically went onto apologized to

1684
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:06,240
everybody under the sun,
you know,

1685
01:15:06,241 --> 01:15:07,074
like,
and then my name comes up and he makes 

1686
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:11,620
the distinction that,
oh,

1687
01:15:11,621 --> 01:15:14,650
well I actually don't feel bad about 
fucking talking shit on Steve.

1688
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:15,483
I don't feel.
He says I actually don't feel bad about 

1689
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:17,644
this at all.
And then he goes on to repeat like all 

1690
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:21,970
the shit that he said from the stage and
like,

1691
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,800
I got so bad I'd fucking shade that 
night,

1692
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:25,900
you know,
your side texting.

1693
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,570
We talked and,
and whatever.

1694
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:30,490
Like he's just getting.
You made the great point.

1695
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:31,001
He said,
hey,

1696
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:31,691
you know,
he just,

1697
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:34,000
he does that shit sometimes.
He says dumb shit and,

1698
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:34,871
and,
and,

1699
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:35,704
uh,
and I actually had a conversation with 

1700
01:15:37,001 --> 01:15:40,840
them about it and it was a hilarious 
conversation because he was like,

1701
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,560
he calls me up and I answered the phone.
He was like,

1702
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:43,271
how you doing?
I'm like,

1703
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:44,260
well,
not that fucking good,

1704
01:15:44,261 --> 01:15:45,430
you know?
I was so fucking pissed.

1705
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,620
I didn't even really fucking sleep last 
night.

1706
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,140
You know,
when I was,

1707
01:15:50,141 --> 01:15:52,360
I was really kept you up.
It kept me up.

1708
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,530
Dude.
That's crazy.

1709
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,720
How do you live with the people affected
that much?

1710
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,940
That's a great question.
It's a really meditative.

1711
01:15:57,941 --> 01:15:58,774
It'll,
I haven't got into the 10 and I've been 

1712
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:04,270
doing it very fucking little.
I got to do it way more.

1713
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:08,230
You can't let someone rent space in your
head like that.

1714
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:11,590
I know he said was very mild.
It was,

1715
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:13,390
it was.
And we sit on the podcast.

1716
01:16:13,391 --> 01:16:15,500
He was also kind of conciliatory.
He was like,

1717
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:18,580
no,
military to everybody but me.

1718
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,550
That's what I think what bothered me so 
much.

1719
01:16:21,551 --> 01:16:22,420
He goes,
he goes,

1720
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:23,830
I feel bad at doing this.
He goes,

1721
01:16:23,831 --> 01:16:25,780
but then,
but then when it comes to this depot,

1722
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:26,693
oh,
I actually don't feel bad about this 

1723
01:16:28,061 --> 01:16:29,800
one.
It's so stupid.

1724
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:31,110
What you do is funny.
I've seen you.

1725
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,530
I've seen you do stand up.
You're funny.

1726
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:33,431
Well,
thank you man.

1727
01:16:33,431 --> 01:16:34,140
I appreciate it.

1728
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,740
I in my mind,
hey,

1729
01:16:35,741 --> 01:16:38,260
I appreciate that so much and I think 
that what,

1730
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,333
what particularly fucking got me hot 
about that was that the time that he 

1731
01:16:43,751 --> 01:16:47,650
chose to attack me was when I had 
fucking,

1732
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:52,480
when I was really working the craft of 
fucking call me writing my own material,

1733
01:16:52,481 --> 01:16:55,120
going out there,
getting outside of my comfort zone,

1734
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,300
doing fucking new shit,
diligently recording it,

1735
01:16:58,301 --> 01:17:03,301
fucking like fucking craft.
And it was just a fucking shitty time.

1736
01:17:03,511 --> 01:17:06,250
So he really does care about standup 
comedy.

1737
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:10,130
But I think because of that carrying it,
it sometimes it blinds you,

1738
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,383
you know,
and I'm very sensitive to it because I 

1739
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:13,454
experienced it a lot when I was first 
starting out where people didn't think 

1740
01:17:15,471 --> 01:17:17,540
that I fit into the mold of what they 
thought.

1741
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:21,860
A standup which should be sure that you 
make that point because yeah,

1742
01:17:21,861 --> 01:17:24,230
it was fucking miles at the fact that I 
got out of shape.

1743
01:17:24,231 --> 01:17:29,231
The way I did was bullshit.
Such a public figure two and your,

1744
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:33,470
your,
your career has been so controversial.

1745
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,130
That's why I don't understand why you're
so sensitive to criticism because you,

1746
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:39,590
you've done everything you've done has 
been chaos.

1747
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,060
You know,
you've done so much chaos.

1748
01:17:41,061 --> 01:17:41,894
I mean,
I've just sort of imagined that so many 

1749
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:43,970
people.
Shit on you.

1750
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,950
I guess I just,
I dunno,

1751
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:49,390
I just think I fucking care about 
comedy.

1752
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,240
I would imagine him saying that to you 
in person just so you know.

1753
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:57,530
What you're doing is not taken lightly.
I would probably smack him.

1754
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,350
I really have to have a really hard time
with that.

1755
01:18:00,351 --> 01:18:03,530
Like what doing standup would.
That's not taken lightly.

1756
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:06,260
What you own.
Standup you out of your fucking mind.

1757
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:07,763
Do you don't like it.
This is what I said to you the other 

1758
01:18:08,871 --> 01:18:10,070
day.
Don't you like stand up?

1759
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:11,210
If I,
I like standup.

1760
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,540
I want my fucking mailman to try it.
He might be funny too.

1761
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:17,780
One of the funniest guys I've ever 
fucking met was a private detective that

1762
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:18,614
I worked for.
He lost his license at a Dui and a I 

1763
01:18:21,411 --> 01:18:24,600
want to be in his driver and I,
he needed a drive.

1764
01:18:24,601 --> 01:18:25,434
He needed an assistant in quotes,
but really what he needed as a guy to 

1765
01:18:27,321 --> 01:18:29,810
drive him around because he lost his 
license for six months or something like

1766
01:18:29,811 --> 01:18:30,644
that.
So I worked for them for like six 

1767
01:18:31,521 --> 01:18:31,820
months.

1768
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:32,653
I drove my,
he was the funniest fucking guy I ever 

1769
01:18:34,281 --> 01:18:36,800
met in my life and while I was doing 
standup,

1770
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:42,440
I think I was 21 at the time and I think
he was probably 35,

1771
01:18:42,891 --> 01:18:44,360
36.
I was like,

1772
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:47,660
this guy just did stand up.
He would fucking put me out of business.

1773
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:50,460
That's all I could think of is like if 
this guy went into stand up,

1774
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,920
you know.
Meanwhile he was a man.

1775
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,720
He had experienced life.
I was a boy.

1776
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:54,613
Right.
But everybody that you like that wants 

1777
01:18:57,921 --> 01:18:59,480
to do standup,
you should encourage them to do it.

1778
01:18:59,481 --> 01:19:00,314
Like my friend Brendan Schaub,
he does stand up and he faces the same 

1779
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:05,210
shit.
People like this fucking guy who's doing

1780
01:19:05,211 --> 01:19:08,880
standup.
I heard about similar,

1781
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:11,090
very Sarah and shit on him,
but I.

1782
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,430
But Eric was just being funny and I said
to him,

1783
01:19:13,431 --> 01:19:14,930
I go,
of course they're going to shit on you.

1784
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:18,760
You're a big handsome gorilla.
Shockingly good luck.

1785
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,550
Good looking fella.
And he's a great dude.

1786
01:19:22,551 --> 01:19:25,250
He's a great guy and he's funny.
He's fucking funny.

1787
01:19:25,251 --> 01:19:27,410
And I told him,
you should do stand up smart.

1788
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,960
He's very smart.
He works hard.

1789
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,770
He's been doing standup a year and he's 
killing it.

1790
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,040
He does.
He does really well.

1791
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:34,953
I mean,
I saw him the other night at the comedy 

1792
01:19:35,601 --> 01:19:40,601
store sandwiched in between me and 
sharks swimming with sharks.

1793
01:19:41,091 --> 01:19:41,924
He was doing a real show,
like at a real show and he had a real 

1794
01:19:43,851 --> 01:19:45,590
good set.
Dane Cook helped me a lot.

1795
01:19:45,591 --> 01:19:47,390
Man.
I know he's a polarizing figure,

1796
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:49,820
but when I,
when I first,

1797
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:52,580
uh,
when I got into standup and earnest,

1798
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:56,780
because back in 2006,
I was like,

1799
01:19:56,781 --> 01:19:57,320
man,
I should,

1800
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,810
I really liked this.
You know,

1801
01:19:59,060 --> 01:19:59,893
I tried it,
I got on stage for a few minutes that 

1802
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:01,904
first night and people have.
The sense I got was that people were 

1803
01:20:04,701 --> 01:20:07,080
excited to see me.
They were rooting for me.

1804
01:20:07,081 --> 01:20:08,220
They wanted me to do well

1805
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,380
for some reason,
like,

1806
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:11,910
like a,
I can be endearing to people and they're

1807
01:20:11,911 --> 01:20:14,640
rooting for me and I got a few laughs,
you know,

1808
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:17,300
I made a couple of fucking gay jokes,
whatever,

1809
01:20:17,301 --> 01:20:18,780
like,
you know,

1810
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,950
and uh,
and before I left the left,

1811
01:20:20,951 --> 01:20:22,730
after that night I scheduled my return 
and,

1812
01:20:22,731 --> 01:20:23,120
and,
and,

1813
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:23,953
and before I came back I wrote,
I wrote a set and I came back and it 

1814
01:20:26,611 --> 01:20:29,700
went reasonably well and I was thrilled.
Then I got over confident.

1815
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:30,150
I was like,
Oh,

1816
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:33,480
I'm just good at standup so I can come 
back again and don't even know.

1817
01:20:33,481 --> 01:20:35,910
I don't try to work on the fucking act I
had written,

1818
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,910
I'm like dominant to fucking God garb 
and wing it.

1819
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,870
And I bombed and I heard her and I 
bombed again.

1820
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:44,063
And then I was like scared to get back 
to it and I was out of control with 

1821
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:46,590
drugs.

1822
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,590
So that guy,
I was really dizzy,

1823
01:20:48,591 --> 01:20:49,424
it wasn't the time now,
once I got sober in Rehab then like 

1824
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:55,070
going to bars,
going to nightclubs,

1825
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:57,390
that's just,
that's not on the table anymore.

1826
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,580
Like again,
you've got to ask yourself do you have a

1827
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:00,414
reason to go there?
And I didn't have any fucking reasons 

1828
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:03,840
but I had every reason to go to a comedy
club.

1829
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,240
So that became like my goto thing at 
night,

1830
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:07,074
you know,
like from going with going out with a 

1831
01:21:07,771 --> 01:21:09,200
girl,
you know,

1832
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:10,043
it's like a thing.
I got a reason to be there and I go to 

1833
01:21:11,281 --> 01:21:15,480
the comedy club and so I'm sitting in 
the comedy club and in my early sobriety

1834
01:21:15,481 --> 01:21:16,980
and we're looking at the stage thinking 
a,

1835
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,930
she'd be on that stage,
I should be on that stage.

1836
01:21:18,931 --> 01:21:20,310
But I was like scared,
you know.

1837
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:25,580
And then as the press machine was,
it wasn't even real.

1838
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:26,413
It was the first name thing I even did 
ostensibly to promote jackass three d 

1839
01:21:29,161 --> 01:21:32,070
was this young Hollywood interview and 
they said Adim cooks in there.

1840
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:34,800
Just go barge genders interview.
It'll be great.

1841
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:36,980
So I walk into Dean cooks,
interview on it,

1842
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:39,680
and I meet him and I'm like,
hey dude,

1843
01:21:39,710 --> 01:21:40,100
like,
uh,

1844
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:40,933
you know,
I've dabbled in standup but I want to 

1845
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:42,504
get serious about it.
I want to really dive in and fucking to 

1846
01:21:45,331 --> 01:21:46,470
his credit man.
He said,

1847
01:21:46,471 --> 01:21:48,030
cool.
He said,

1848
01:21:48,031 --> 01:21:49,560
let's do it.
I'll give you my number.

1849
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:52,230
Will get on stage at the,
at the Improv,

1850
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,070
like,
uh,

1851
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:53,903
in,
in a week a gave me his number and I 

1852
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:57,120
fucking wrote.
And I wrote,

1853
01:21:57,121 --> 01:22:00,930
I rode that whole fucking week and went 
when the fucking practice of that shitty

1854
01:22:00,931 --> 01:22:01,764
little,
uh,

1855
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,480
the open mic,
Marty's,

1856
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:06,370
it's hilarious.
He wouldn't even know it was morning.

1857
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:09,870
It's on Sunset Boulevard,
right by rock and roll routes.

1858
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:10,773
It's a,
it's a hilarious little fucking hole in 

1859
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:13,870
the wall and stand open,
you know,

1860
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,380
open mic.
And I went to,

1861
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:16,380
you know,
sure enough,

1862
01:22:16,381 --> 01:22:19,170
I met Dean Cook at the Improv.
Like,

1863
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,153
dude,
it was like two comics after Sarah 

1864
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:22,823
Silverman.
And then I go on and then Dane goes on 

1865
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:29,420
and right after Dane said he sat down 
with me and fucking gave me notes.

1866
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:30,803
The first thing he said was,
I'm not sending you back to the drawing 

1867
01:22:32,521 --> 01:22:33,354
board,
which was like his way of saying that 

1868
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:38,490
the material I did like wasn't like 
don't rewrite.

1869
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:39,383
Like it's good,
he's just worried about your delivery 

1870
01:22:40,271 --> 01:22:41,104
and your timing and from there I went to
the fucking tonight's laugh fighter 

1871
01:22:44,671 --> 01:22:46,280
Danes there,
which is,

1872
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,000
he took me under his wing,
you know,

1873
01:22:48,001 --> 01:22:49,620
like,
just like with regularity,

1874
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:50,593
she'd go and I'd go and he'd go the 
other way around and he'd sit me down 

1875
01:22:53,611 --> 01:22:56,140
and give me notes.
That put so much fucking winded myself.

1876
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:57,063
That's awesome.
I'm really grateful to Dane Cook for 

1877
01:22:58,411 --> 01:23:03,411
that music through.
Oh yeah.

1878
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:10,900
What's up with hermaphrodites their real
name to Intersex a couple years ago.

1879
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:12,760
It's like the medical terminology was 
changed.

1880
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:15,460
So is there such thing as having a Dick 
and pussy?

1881
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:16,720
Yeah.
So there's a.

1882
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:20,170
here's all the stats on which is born 
with which,

1883
01:23:20,171 --> 01:23:23,590
and there's different one in 1000,
666 births.

1884
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:29,520
So I don't know which is actually the 
androgen insensitivity syndrome both.

1885
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,000
So they don't necessarily use the term 
hermaphrodites right?

1886
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:36,190
Yeah.
It's so used to like in biology.

1887
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,210
Oh,
I see.

1888
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:39,610
So when it comes to.
Oh,

1889
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:42,340
so there's like a list of.
It looks like there's like 30 of them.

1890
01:23:42,341 --> 01:23:43,001
How many are there?
One,

1891
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:43,241
two,
three,

1892
01:23:43,241 --> 01:23:43,500
four,
five,

1893
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,140
six.
Hold it.

1894
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:46,473
When referring to humans,
I think they stopped using that word 

1895
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:51,850
because it made people feel bad.
Probably Jesus Christ.

1896
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,270
So complete Gonadal Digen,
Isas,

1897
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:56,800
oo.
One in 100.

1898
01:23:56,801 --> 01:23:58,240
50,000.
That can't be good.

1899
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,980
Alpha reductase deficiency.
Five.

1900
01:24:02,981 --> 01:24:05,510
Alpha reductase deficiency.
Vaginal agent.

1901
01:24:05,511 --> 01:24:09,120
SSS.
Imagine Vagina vaginal agent.

1902
01:24:09,121 --> 01:24:12,370
Emphasis that feel.
It sounds like you have an old pussy.

1903
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:13,750
You're born.
I'm sorry.

1904
01:24:13,751 --> 01:24:16,330
Your baby was born with an old pussy.
He looked down.

1905
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:20,260
It's like an old fucking pussy.
I don't even want to know what their is,

1906
01:24:23,070 --> 01:24:26,440
but only your vagina could be worse.
Things.

1907
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,453
Phases.
Cute.

1908
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:30,903
So there are hermaphrodites.
There are people that are born with a 

1909
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:33,334
vagina and Google are.
Is there people that are born with both 

1910
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:38,680
of a giant,
a penis?

1911
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:40,143
Oh,
are people born with both a vagina and 

1912
01:24:42,241 --> 01:24:43,074
penis?
Because it was too many medical terms 

1913
01:24:43,691 --> 01:24:44,524
there.
I don't know which one of those would 

1914
01:24:45,071 --> 01:24:46,120
apply.
Right.

1915
01:24:46,121 --> 01:24:49,030
It's Kinda like with that,
with little people.

1916
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,980
And I hate that fucking term.
Well,

1917
01:24:50,981 --> 01:24:54,610
the thing about Dr drew is he's an 
addiction specialist,

1918
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:56,140
right?
So He.

1919
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,600
How much does he even know about this 
stuff?

1920
01:24:58,630 --> 01:24:59,463
I mean,
how much did he really learn about this 

1921
01:25:00,371 --> 01:25:01,204
stuff?
And he's also an addiction specialist 

1922
01:25:02,891 --> 01:25:06,250
who earnestly says that marijuana is 
hugely addictive,

1923
01:25:06,251 --> 01:25:07,084
which is just.

1924
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:12,500
I did,
I used to fucking used to do it a lot,

1925
01:25:12,501 --> 01:25:13,430
I'm sure.
But yeah,

1926
01:25:13,431 --> 01:25:15,920
here's the thing dude,
like I,

1927
01:25:15,921 --> 01:25:17,660
uh,
at one point,

1928
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:18,740
um,
I was,

1929
01:25:18,741 --> 01:25:23,460
I was starting to have setting for this,
this chair can I humped uh,

1930
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:26,060
uh,
as strange chicken,

1931
01:25:26,061 --> 01:25:28,730
her bed and tied the rubber and,
and not,

1932
01:25:28,731 --> 01:25:29,880
which I would do,
you know,

1933
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:34,040
an entire Robert and non threw it on the
floor or fucking dog ate the rubber.

1934
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:35,230
Right?
And like,

1935
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,433
and um,
and it was her boyfriend's dog and I'm 

1936
01:25:38,121 --> 01:25:38,990
thinking,
oh no,

1937
01:25:38,991 --> 01:25:40,820
the fucking dog.
Maybe take the rubber,

1938
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:41,923
the rubber,
like the dog tempt them fucking rubber 

1939
01:25:44,511 --> 01:25:46,570
for like a victory lap and it's kind of 
driving.

1940
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:48,110
It's going to look terrible for this 
girl,

1941
01:25:48,111 --> 01:25:49,720
so I'm like,
following the dog around.

1942
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:50,623
Ultimately the dog shit it out and it 
was hilarious but I felt bad because 

1943
01:25:53,631 --> 01:25:54,680
like,
you know,

1944
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:55,523
I based,
it's kind of like sodomized him the dog 

1945
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:58,210
a little bit.

1946
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,820
And so then I felt like to make it up to
the dog,

1947
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:07,010
get the high when I owe,
I owe it to the dog to do it myself.

1948
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:07,844
And I'm like,
because this is a funny bit like condom 

1949
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:12,560
for load in it and wow,
that was essentially,

1950
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,520
that would be really fun.
But I got it in my head.

1951
01:26:16,521 --> 01:26:18,050
I'm going to swallow a condom,
but then I was like,

1952
01:26:18,051 --> 01:26:18,681
okay,
cool.

1953
01:26:18,681 --> 01:26:20,810
When I'm on tour,
when I'm on tour in Europe,

1954
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,033
I'll fucking put weed in the condom,
tied in a knot and it'll be like a skit 

1955
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:28,400
where I've found minton international 
drug smuggler skit.

1956
01:26:28,401 --> 01:26:31,280
I'll do it country and I'll fly to the 
other country and shit it out.

1957
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,230
And uh,
and I did it.

1958
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:34,500
It was his fucking saga.
Actually.

1959
01:26:34,501 --> 01:26:35,334
I have a fucking epic they guy.
There's a huge tent pole a bit in my 

1960
01:26:38,631 --> 01:26:40,460
standard right now about that whole.

1961
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:43,610
I got arrested for international drug 
smuggling and Sweden.

1962
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:45,650
Did you?
I did.

1963
01:26:45,651 --> 01:26:48,070
And it's fucking ipad.
That's so classic.

1964
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:52,040
Swallowing a condo.
Greatest fucking story ever did.

1965
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,200
It's so fucking awesome.
Yeah,

1966
01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:56,110
I get it.
Yeah.

1967
01:26:56,970 --> 01:27:01,880
I spent such a get caught because I 
fucking told the press like I was like,

1968
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:03,670
at first I did it.
I did it.

1969
01:27:03,671 --> 01:27:04,504
It was so mad.
I didn't so big they want to try to 

1970
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:07,754
fucking swallow.
It got stuck in my throat and I'm 

1971
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,450
freaking the fuck out.
I'm turning out like.

1972
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:13,503
And then I fly.
I fly from Norway to Sweden and a 

1973
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,830
Knoxville told me I was.
It was the nug.

1974
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:20,053
See I didn't even take.
I didn't even break the buds off the 

1975
01:27:21,801 --> 01:27:26,801
stem and it had a bucket of Moroccan 
hash in there too.

1976
01:27:34,871 --> 01:27:37,580
To put Jesus in the same cognitive.
Yeah.

1977
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:38,414
And I swallowed it.
Dick Dick was one of the jugs deep 

1978
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:43,910
throat in the incredible.

1979
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:47,253
Oh,
show me in your fingers how big this 

1980
01:27:50,151 --> 01:27:52,310
thing was.
It was uh,

1981
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:53,900
I dunno,
I mean I have,

1982
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:56,280
it's on video and that's it for my next 
comedy special.

1983
01:27:56,281 --> 01:27:57,410
It's on video.
Yeah,

1984
01:27:57,411 --> 01:27:59,480
the filmed everything it was.
That was formative for my,

1985
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:03,320
for my DVD at the visit online.
I'm sure it probably is.

1986
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:04,011
But what's,
what,

1987
01:28:04,011 --> 01:28:04,844
what's so I'm so excited about my next 
comedy special is that so many of the 

1988
01:28:08,001 --> 01:28:11,750
stories I tell in my stand up or things 
that happened on camera originally,

1989
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:12,883
so I'm editing into editing into the 
fucking actual standup kind of like you 

1990
01:28:17,151 --> 01:28:20,390
do with the podcast,
like supporting foot archival footage,

1991
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,570
which just demonstrates that,
that everything is not only not true.

1992
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,290
It's not only truthful,
it's not even embellished,

1993
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:30,300
but it's like,
it's like a 100 percent and saw like,

1994
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,780
am just so excited to do that.
Uh,

1995
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:35,150
yeah.
That's all my God.

1996
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,313
Wait a minute.
It's hard to tell because the 

1997
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:39,020
perspective,
where's your fingers?

1998
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,023
It's a fucking play it.
So they could say that's where I'm 

1999
01:28:44,001 --> 01:28:47,540
swallowing.
I can click and go fucking massive.

2000
01:28:47,710 --> 01:28:50,150
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2001
01:28:50,151 --> 01:28:54,800
It got stuck and people that are 
looking,

2002
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:57,070
it's like basically like an eight year 
old here.

2003
01:28:57,071 --> 01:28:58,060
I just,
it's,

2004
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:02,160
it's totally stuck in my throat.
Oh my God.

2005
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:09,890
And you're throwing up blood trying to 
throwing up blood.

2006
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:11,533
Oh,
this is so crazy to see the inside of 

2007
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:15,350
your body up.
I was trying to swallow it.

2008
01:29:15,351 --> 01:29:16,770
It wouldn't go down.
I'm trying to Barf.

2009
01:29:16,771 --> 01:29:18,490
It wouldn't go.
It wouldn't come on.

2010
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:23,250
Fly to Sweden because like my buddies 
are like,

2011
01:29:23,251 --> 01:29:24,084
we got to take care of the hardship that
out ever took six and a half days at 

2012
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:30,323
Knox was active.
You're going to dive intestinal 

2013
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:34,830
strangulation because if I can get a 
block at my intestines,

2014
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:35,970
oh my God,
dude,

2015
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:37,363
I got sorry.
Ticket Tuesdays to come out and when it 

2016
01:29:39,181 --> 01:29:39,811
came out,
man,

2017
01:29:39,811 --> 01:29:44,811
you must pass my asshole exploded.
I don't want to tell all my jokes on the

2018
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:48,690
podcast because that's fucking land.
A big important part of the day.

2019
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:51,750
There's fucking the best bet.
I love it.

2020
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:52,923
I mean I've,
I've,

2021
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,570
I'm proud of what I'm doing on stage.

2022
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:59,560
So are you saying that pot is a.
That was how I got in.

2023
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,710
That's how I first did it.
Then I realized,

2024
01:30:01,711 --> 01:30:03,840
okay,
because filming wild boys,

2025
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:08,900
every time we would like I would freak 
the fuck out whenever we went to the Far

2026
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:11,070
East because you know,
you're not going to be able to find weed

2027
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:11,933
and that was not a case.
So I anytime I went to anywhere where I 

2028
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:17,670
wasn't competent I would be able to get 
weed.

2029
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:20,610
I sat there with my.
Before I go into the airport I sat there

2030
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:21,444
with my fucking weed grinder and grind 
it up like a ton and fucking compacted 

2031
01:30:26,971 --> 01:30:27,804
so you know,
broke the buds off the steps and then I 

2032
01:30:31,471 --> 01:30:33,660
would,
I would fill up and put them out like an

2033
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:35,430
eighth in each condom,
whatever.

2034
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:39,960
Night Nights and smaller pack it up and 
I would swallow like six of them,

2035
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:41,570
you know,
really doll.

2036
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,530
Yeah,
I would say when you swallow those,

2037
01:30:43,531 --> 01:30:47,310
how long did it take to ship those ones?
Those ones that come up quick was one to

2038
01:30:47,311 --> 01:30:48,930
come out and,
and I don't know,

2039
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,140
like one to two days,
like a,

2040
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:54,980
of something like that many times you 
swole condoms every day.

2041
01:30:54,981 --> 01:30:56,460
I went in,
when I went to Thailand,

2042
01:30:56,461 --> 01:30:57,294
I give them one onto Russia,
like a dad didn't think it was my 

2043
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:00,090
fucking thing.
I was like,

2044
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:03,570
that was your thing was shitting out 
your pot that you would smoke?

2045
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:05,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

2046
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:09,390
And it's either 70 when you lit it.
Did ever smell like a condom?

2047
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:13,470
It never smelled like a condo dot the 
day that say there's a lot of,

2048
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,700
uh,
there's a lot of funny in that,

2049
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:18,780
but I'm sure that's a psychological 
issue.

2050
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:23,670
It's not like physical addiction is what
we're talking about kids and addicted to

2051
01:31:23,671 --> 01:31:27,120
alcohol to the point where alcohol is 
one of the most dangerous for addictions

2052
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:30,030
because when you get onto these die from
it.

2053
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:31,920
Sure.
Like that's how he mean winehouse died.

2054
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,600
Like a lot of people think she died from
drugs.

2055
01:31:33,601 --> 01:31:36,270
She actually died because she went cold 
Turkey off of alcohol.

2056
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:37,733
I believe that it kills me.
I know that I'm a fucking true drug 

2057
01:31:41,281 --> 01:31:43,800
addict is that I watched that 
documentary,

2058
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:44,663
amy,
and as I walked out of the fucking 

2059
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:46,801
theater,
I like,

2060
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:51,801
fuck man,
I want to get so crazy.

2061
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:57,050
That was the least glamorous portrayal 
of drug addiction to ever,

2062
01:31:57,070 --> 01:31:59,070
ever just looked great to me.
I was like,

2063
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,670
my God fucked out.
Well,

2064
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:01,733
there's no,
there's no mistaking the fact that 

2065
01:32:05,021 --> 01:32:07,930
somehow or another that what she was 
doing with her life,

2066
01:32:07,931 --> 01:32:08,764
whether or not you could say that it was
the drugs or the state of mind that she 

2067
01:32:10,721 --> 01:32:11,554
was in when she was taking the drugs.
She produced some fucking amazing music 

2068
01:32:14,621 --> 01:32:15,630
man.
Right.

2069
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:17,590
She just tapped into it.

2070
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:20,320
Whatever it is like that.
She wasn't the hottest chick like,

2071
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:21,233
you know,
you know that someone's talented when 

2072
01:32:22,631 --> 01:32:27,310
they're not that hot chick and they're 
fucking huge star for singing.

2073
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,650
Oh yeah.
She was super talented.

2074
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:30,270
She was saying,
well,

2075
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,920
I mean,
there's a lot of hot chicks like Adele.

2076
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:34,600
She's.
Who else?

2077
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:36,470
Um,
I mean,

2078
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,833
I'm sure you could find other ones.
I've never really sat down and thought 

2079
01:32:40,361 --> 01:32:41,400
about it.
Exactly.

2080
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:44,600
It's kind of a rule that you're supposed
to be really hot and the same.

2081
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:46,030
Yeah,
I guess so.

2082
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,980
And I'm trying to think like amy 
winehouse.

2083
01:32:47,981 --> 01:32:49,840
Adele.
That's unfortunate,

2084
01:32:49,841 --> 01:32:51,190
isn't it?
It's bullshit.

2085
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:52,300
Yeah.
For a girl,

2086
01:32:52,301 --> 01:32:53,650
right?
That's gotta suck,

2087
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:54,993
right?
Oh,

2088
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:59,390
what Dick's for yards.
But see ya.

2089
01:32:59,930 --> 01:33:02,920
Who's that?
C is not super hot and I dunno know that

2090
01:33:02,921 --> 01:33:04,510
is.
She uh,

2091
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:09,100
is a hugely popular singer.
I'm so out of the loop.

2092
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:10,293
I'm not old man.
Who doesn't know what the fuck's going 

2093
01:33:11,351 --> 01:33:13,870
on with the young kids today?
Kids today.

2094
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:15,183
I get it there and he had to tell me 
that little bow fakes the fact that he 

2095
01:33:17,831 --> 01:33:22,831
was on a jet,
a private jet when he said that.

2096
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:24,963
He said it was his jet and I told him he
got busted and he was flying on a 

2097
01:33:27,461 --> 01:33:30,940
private jet and some of them was 
actually on a commercial flight with him

2098
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:33,550
and took a picture of him because they 
saw it on instagram.

2099
01:33:33,551 --> 01:33:35,650
This motherfucker is full of shit.
He's right in front of me.

2100
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:36,963
That's so fucking classic.
That's exactly like that dude bear 

2101
01:33:39,401 --> 01:33:41,020
grylls.
Yes.

2102
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,790
Very similar.
Same type of thing.

2103
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:43,870
Well,
it's actually worse.

2104
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:47,350
It's like he,
he set up his tent,

2105
01:33:47,351 --> 01:33:48,184
like Ferris Bueller with the bow thing 
is indicative of an entire culture 

2106
01:33:54,910 --> 01:33:55,743
shift.
It's just all about showing off your 

2107
01:33:57,191 --> 01:33:59,750
flashlight shit and like showing that 
you know,

2108
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:00,593
we ball in here,
we bought it and I was watching a 

2109
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:07,771
fucking documentary vice documentary on 
Youtube about a bay area hip hop and the

2110
01:34:08,171 --> 01:34:09,370
whole thing is they're like,
they're.

2111
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:12,990
They're talking about how it's such a 
fucking travesty that are the tech money

2112
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,960
came in and,
and the area got gentrified headed.

2113
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:16,803
The whole thing is they're like,
our land got gentrified and the rap 

2114
01:34:21,311 --> 01:34:26,311
artists talk about their life and I got 
millions like it doesn't.

2115
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,393
It doesn't jive.
You can't be complaining about 

2116
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:31,480
gentrification and talking about your 
millions.

2117
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:34,570
Well,
not all hip hop does that,

2118
01:34:34,571 --> 01:34:36,700
you know,
there's like some socially conscious hip

2119
01:34:36,701 --> 01:34:41,390
documentary.
They were so stupid that complaining,

2120
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:42,633
complaining that these people that make 
the fucking very electronics they need 

2121
01:34:45,731 --> 01:34:50,731
to make their music came in and I had a 
terrible time in San Francisco.

2122
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:54,190
Francisco trip.
It's my car broken into.

2123
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,650
It was parked it outside of a fucking 
vegetarian restaurant.

2124
01:34:57,651 --> 01:34:58,040
Granted

2125
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,530
in the tenderloin.
It's terrible,

2126
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:01,823
but it was fucking noon.
It was parked right outside the 

2127
01:35:04,881 --> 01:35:06,950
restaurant and they fucking smashed on 
window.

2128
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:07,784
And then for the rest of the weekend I 
was at Cobb's comedy club the rest of 

2129
01:35:10,781 --> 01:35:12,500
the week and every single person I said,
yeah,

2130
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:15,020
I got my fucking window,
smashed my shit stolen on my car.

2131
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:16,640
Every person I mentioned that to you 
said,

2132
01:35:16,641 --> 01:35:17,700
yeah,
that happened to me too.

2133
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:21,680
And that's starting to happen in La too,
man.

2134
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:25,770
What's always happened on La West 
Hollywood there and smash and grab isn't

2135
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:28,550
becoming a bit did in San Francisco to 
the worst,

2136
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:30,530
but it's always happened.
It's always been broke.

2137
01:35:30,531 --> 01:35:31,364
People that break into people's cars,
especially if you leave anything like 

2138
01:35:32,931 --> 01:35:35,090
really obvious in the front seat,
it's visible,

2139
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:36,163
visible.
That's was the biggest score that 

2140
01:35:38,630 --> 01:35:42,110
whoever broken in my car,
I had my Super Pac,

2141
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:44,690
I was getting ready to go.
Fucking fell on my super PAC is like,

2142
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:47,900
plus I have the merchant money from 
selling.

2143
01:35:47,901 --> 01:35:48,734
Fucking merge left in your car to I was 
going to film and I didn't even fucking 

2144
01:35:52,731 --> 01:35:54,410
thing about it.
Day there is like three minutes.

2145
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:55,303
You didn't think that you are going to 
park and one of the shittiest 

2146
01:35:56,811 --> 01:36:00,780
neighborhoods in all of California with 
a really valuable.

2147
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:01,823
Yes,
Joe.

2148
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:04,560
You've seen it like it's like.
It's like,

2149
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:05,870
wow.
It's so weird.

2150
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:08,510
Okay,
Joe.

2151
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:12,310
I'm dumb.
I hit my head a lot.

2152
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:13,153
Joe.

2153
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:18,460
People don't know how bad the tenderloin
is.

2154
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:19,523
I didn't know how bad it was and for me 
like I'd like to add to what could 

2155
01:36:23,571 --> 01:36:26,840
happen outside of a spiritual fucking 
vegetarian restaurant,

2156
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:32,070
which is right outside the window.
Plus we sat and sitting next to them.

2157
01:36:32,571 --> 01:36:36,200
We sat by the window so as to see the 
car in our line of vision.

2158
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:39,440
How's that possible?
Yeah.

2159
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:41,270
I don't know.
Yeah,

2160
01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:42,283
San Francisco is a weird place now 
because like the money that you have to 

2161
01:36:45,861 --> 01:36:50,030
spend to buy a house there is so crazy 
that it doesn't even make sense anymore.

2162
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:50,990
Right?
Like they.

2163
01:36:50,991 --> 01:36:51,824
There was a house that was for sale for 
over a million dollars and it was a 

2164
01:36:54,531 --> 01:36:57,920
fucking tiny,
shitty shack that had to be torn down.

2165
01:36:58,190 --> 01:36:59,023
I mean,
there was literally nothing there and 

2166
01:37:00,291 --> 01:37:01,124
people like this is the most piece of 
ridiculous real estate in all of North 

2167
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:04,970
America.

2168
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:06,680
Right.
It's all that tech money.

2169
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:09,680
I lived there when I was a kid.
I lived there from age seven to 11.

2170
01:37:09,681 --> 01:37:12,350
I still magic show fisherman's wharf 
when I was eight years old.

2171
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:13,443
I think you were telling me that you're 
in a car or you're talking with the al 

2172
01:37:16,481 --> 01:37:17,450
about it,
but what?

2173
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:18,980
We work to cops together.
Yeah,

2174
01:37:18,981 --> 01:37:21,740
but I used to live there when I was a 
little kid and it was just,

2175
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,633
you know,
this was during the Vietnam war is like 

2176
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:25,730
hippie time.
It was weird.

2177
01:37:25,731 --> 01:37:29,420
It was just all hippies and gay people 
and it was a,

2178
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:30,523
you know,
that was what San Francisco was forever 

2179
01:37:32,001 --> 01:37:36,290
until this tech boom and now it's just 
fucking insane money.

2180
01:37:36,291 --> 01:37:38,690
If you ever go on,
like I go on like that,

2181
01:37:38,691 --> 01:37:40,090
a APP,
Trulia,

2182
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:41,570
it's like a real estate or art,
but I go,

2183
01:37:41,571 --> 01:37:42,404
what do they look?
What kind of houses they have in 

2184
01:37:43,101 --> 01:37:43,580
Seattle?

2185
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,050
Like,
let's look at houses just for goof.

2186
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:46,213
Sure.
You look at San Francisco and you're 

2187
01:37:46,971 --> 01:37:47,804
like,
what is 14 million by you in San 

2188
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:51,020
Francisco?
Holy Shit.

2189
01:37:51,021 --> 01:37:52,500
Are you getting fucked?
Right?

2190
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:55,710
Like a regular house.
It's like $14 bucks.

2191
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:00,120
West Vancouver is pretty fucked up too.
So a lot of tech money up there too.

2192
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,830
I don't know what it is,
but it's tech money for whatever reason.

2193
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:05,843
I guess it's just because you know,
everybody uses tech and just chunk tons 

2194
01:38:08,671 --> 01:38:12,060
of money in it,
but those guys just seem to figure out a

2195
01:38:12,061 --> 01:38:12,894
way to make more money than anybody.
There's so much money in San Francisco 

2196
01:38:16,531 --> 01:38:17,760
though.
It's crazy.

2197
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:19,080
Right?
I know.

2198
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:20,003
So you had a bad time at San Francisco 
because you parked the car on the 

2199
01:38:21,781 --> 01:38:24,400
tenderloin with a lot of money and a lot
of electronics,

2200
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:29,040
like laptop,
Ipad Fuckin,

2201
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:29,903
Seventy d,
every lens will three grand in cash or 

2202
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:35,640
are you doing.

2203
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:38,340
I'm so you're doing like these shows 
that you're filming them,

2204
01:38:38,341 --> 01:38:40,950
is that what you're bringing all this 
electronics sometimes.

2205
01:38:40,951 --> 01:38:41,784
Yeah.
And sometimes I'm just filming for 

2206
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:46,650
whatever youtube you know now you did 
your showtime special.

2207
01:38:46,651 --> 01:38:48,000
That was what,
a year and a half ago or so?

2208
01:38:48,030 --> 01:38:50,940
Yeah,
it was the end of 2015 and then it aired

2209
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:53,280
in March of 2016.
Yeah,

2210
01:38:53,281 --> 01:38:56,240
because remember you get in touch with 
me saying you need so much choke Johan,

2211
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:57,083
Texas.
I'm like,

2212
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:59,850
I know the guy.
I fucking loved him.

2213
01:38:59,851 --> 01:39:01,690
Kennedy MTM.
So thrilled.

2214
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:03,590
The top of my plugin especially came out
on showtime.

2215
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:04,290
Oh,
that's awesome.

2216
01:39:04,290 --> 01:39:05,123
I really fucking people get it somewhere
other than showtimes that available on 

2217
01:39:08,131 --> 01:39:11,210
Netflix and those things.
He had um,

2218
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:13,860
uh,
the showtime showtime on demand.

2219
01:39:13,861 --> 01:39:17,070
And then Vimeo and I thought it was on 
Vimeo.

2220
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:17,943
Yeah,
I think that,

2221
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:19,460
that uh,
it was,

2222
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:22,530
I guess there was tied up for two years 
before it can go on Netflix.

2223
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:24,690
So No.
So is it available now?

2224
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:26,520
Not yet.
Not yet soon.

2225
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:28,140
Yeah.
That's cool.

2226
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:29,840
I'm fucking stoked.
Time on,

2227
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:31,740
on how that came out.
Are you going to do another one?

2228
01:39:31,930 --> 01:39:32,880
Yeah,
like I said,

2229
01:39:32,881 --> 01:39:33,714
man,
I'm working on,

2230
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:37,800
I'm working on doing a comedy special 
where I edit in archival footage,

2231
01:39:37,801 --> 01:39:40,800
which is sort of makes it a docu comedy 
special,

2232
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:42,060
which I have,
which I love.

2233
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:45,420
Do people or people born that have a 
penis and vagina.

2234
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:50,370
We figured that out.
I was looking up a yes and no.

2235
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:51,363
I would say I forgot what I was reading 
most of the headmaster after that comes 

2236
01:39:53,641 --> 01:39:58,200
from having ovaries and testicles that 
are maybe both at the same time.

2237
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:03,920
There's a pseudo hermaphrodites or also 
true hermaphrodites,

2238
01:40:04,471 --> 01:40:05,304
and there's some sort of true 
hermaphrodite is someone who has both 

2239
01:40:07,141 --> 01:40:07,801
genitals.
Yeah.

2240
01:40:07,801 --> 01:40:10,440
This is the best picture,
true Hermaphrodites,

2241
01:40:10,441 --> 01:40:13,920
internal sex organs,
tissue,

2242
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:15,143
and some cases.
That means that a ball in one side and 

2243
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:20,040
ovary and the other and others,
that means hybrid beasties notice,

2244
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:23,370
oh my God.
Over testes to the naked eye.

2245
01:40:23,371 --> 01:40:25,830
They're external genitals tend to be 
iffy.

2246
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:29,370
Maybe it's a big clit,
perhaps the urban dictionary,

2247
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:33,440
scientific scientific document per 
chance.

2248
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:36,600
It's some unholy.
Pino vaginal mismatched.

2249
01:40:36,601 --> 01:40:37,434
Pseudo hermaphrodites have the 
chromosome and internal sex organs of 

2250
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:45,960
one gender while the external 
protuberances are.

2251
01:40:45,961 --> 01:40:48,210
Again,
anyone's guest photo,

2252
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:51,000
click that.
Nothing.

2253
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:55,540
Oh,
that's a hardcore clear.

2254
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:57,250
That's.
That makes sense.

2255
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:59,680
That is a Hermaphrodite,
right?

2256
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:02,430
Tibi.
This page also has something called A.

2257
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:05,920
There's a is an ant eater.
What'd you say?

2258
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:07,493
Double Penis.
And then there's this thing down at the 

2259
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:10,900
bottom I found,
which is this?

2260
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:11,920
Never heard of this.

2261
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:14,580
Persistent chloe,
Chloe,

2262
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:16,573
one in 20,000 female verse Gianna and 
Vagina and Urethra coverage converged 

2263
01:41:21,861 --> 01:41:24,680
into one nauseatingly funnel like drain 
and Chol.

2264
01:41:24,681 --> 01:41:27,950
Located somewhere in the area between 
the clitoris and the buttocks.

2265
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:30,680
Poopy and vaginal sludge.
Mingle.

2266
01:41:30,681 --> 01:41:33,500
Freely corrective surgeries.
Costly,

2267
01:41:33,501 --> 01:41:35,870
complicated and risky.
Don't click on that photo.

2268
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:38,000
Um,
what about the double vagina photo?

2269
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:39,890
Click on that bitch.
See what the fuck's going on,

2270
01:41:39,891 --> 01:41:42,290
but not.
Oh Jesus.

2271
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:45,200
There's one next to the other one.
Whoa.

2272
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:48,110
Why does it look like that?
It looks like a chicken.

2273
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:50,510
Like an autopsy,
right?

2274
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:51,800
Yeah.
That's not good.

2275
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:54,310
That's when it didn't work out.
Um,

2276
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:55,930
let's go with the double penis.
Let me see.

2277
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:56,773
Adult Penis picture is that real?
And this isn't one of those dudes that 

2278
01:41:59,631 --> 01:42:03,110
slices it.
That's a cred that micro penis.

2279
01:42:03,111 --> 01:42:08,111
Things like bomber man click to penises.
Oh,

2280
01:42:08,931 --> 01:42:10,190
it's true guys.
Double Deck.

2281
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:11,480
No,
that's a slice.

2282
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:13,700
That's a.
This is websites.

2283
01:42:13,701 --> 01:42:18,250
Bullshit image.
That's a 1955.

2284
01:42:19,070 --> 01:42:19,611
Oh,
okay.

2285
01:42:19,611 --> 01:42:22,370
So it's not a split.
It's just he's just got a broken,

2286
01:42:22,371 --> 01:42:25,120
doubled dick thing going on.
He's peeing out of his clit whole.

2287
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:28,880
It's like the Lizard Dude that Kinda 
tongue as a lot of people do that.

2288
01:42:28,910 --> 01:42:32,270
That's a real common to cutting the 
tongue cutting the Deq.

2289
01:42:32,330 --> 01:42:33,163
They split their dick down the Middle 
and then the pee comes out and just a 

2290
01:42:35,991 --> 01:42:40,310
big Ole splatter and wow.
People just.

2291
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,630
They just do.
You know?

2292
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:46,220
It's a weird world.
We live in Steevo.

2293
01:42:47,810 --> 01:42:49,760
So another thing about my comedy 
special,

2294
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:54,800
that guy's got to double Dick's pig.
Fatties really does.

2295
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:57,450
Maybe you could donate one to a friend 
with a little bit.

2296
01:42:58,220 --> 01:42:59,053
They do that now.
They do in Doug Dick replacement 

2297
01:43:00,981 --> 01:43:01,814
surgeries.
But like if someone had an accident or 

2298
01:43:03,891 --> 01:43:04,724
something happened to their Dick,
they give them a penile replacement 

2299
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,353
where they'll,
someone will die and they'll take his 

2300
01:43:10,731 --> 01:43:14,420
dick and sew it onto you and it works.
You can get an erection and everything

2301
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,960
and they do it for a soldier that got an
explosion.

2302
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,520
I thought,
I remember reading that.

2303
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:20,533
I do not remember.
I remember the first guy that got it 

2304
01:43:22,431 --> 01:43:23,264
done though.
I believe it was a 50 year old man and 

2305
01:43:24,921 --> 01:43:29,120
something happened to him and he was 
dickless for like a year.

2306
01:43:30,230 --> 01:43:31,670
Tough year.
Yeah.

2307
01:43:31,671 --> 01:43:33,520
Well he kind of sewed back up memory.
He could.

2308
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:37,490
He did porn when it was done.
It was just the head of his Dick.

2309
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:38,713
She cut it in half.
She basically just slopped the top off 

2310
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:42,243
of that.
Yeah,

2311
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:44,970
yeah,
yeah,

2312
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:50,660
yeah.
I'll never forget and I didn't even know

2313
01:43:50,661 --> 01:43:52,340
that this is until somebody explained

2314
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:54,020
to me on the show that this actually 
happened,

2315
01:43:54,021 --> 01:43:54,854
but uh,
Ozzy Osbourne's wife was on some talk 

2316
01:43:57,891 --> 01:43:58,724
show that she was doing for awhile and 
she was joking around about some woman 

2317
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:03,453
cut her husband's Dick off and threw it 
in a garbage disposal and they were 

2318
01:44:06,771 --> 01:44:08,390
laughing about it.
I'm just laughing,

2319
01:44:08,391 --> 01:44:11,360
thinking about his willie spinning 
around inside that garbage pillar.

2320
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:13,430
And I went,
wow,

2321
01:44:13,431 --> 01:44:15,950
what double standards with crazy double 
standards,

2322
01:44:16,130 --> 01:44:16,963
because you could,
you imagine a group of men sitting 

2323
01:44:18,021 --> 01:44:18,854
around laughing about a guy cutting off 
a chick's pussy and throwing it in a 

2324
01:44:21,981 --> 01:44:23,150
garbage disposal.
There's,

2325
01:44:23,151 --> 01:44:27,020
I can't imagine a scenario where you 
would not only laugh about that,

2326
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:30,200
but laugh about it on television and 
think it's okay.

2327
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:35,180
But somehow or another it was okay for 
her to laugh about a guy losing his dick

2328
01:44:35,181 --> 01:44:38,300
and having a chopped off and thrown into
a fucking garbage disposal.

2329
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:40,910
So weird,
creepy double standard.

2330
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:44,450
Right?
But at the same time,

2331
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:45,313
like if you think like,
I'm kind of close to this because 

2332
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:54,050
sometimes people want to make like a 
female version of jackass where girls do

2333
01:44:54,051 --> 01:44:57,440
like terrible shit and,
and hurt themselves on purpose.

2334
01:44:58,250 --> 01:44:59,083
That's never gonna work.
And it boils down to a hormonal thing 

2335
01:45:02,031 --> 01:45:07,031
because like men with testosterone,
the idea is that,

2336
01:45:07,791 --> 01:45:09,620
you know,
we're providers and we're supposed to be

2337
01:45:09,621 --> 01:45:12,080
like macho and prove that we're tough.
And so it,

2338
01:45:12,110 --> 01:45:12,680
it,
it,

2339
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:16,310
it becomes funny to see a guy fail and 
get hurt.

2340
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,050
Like that's fun.
And because it's but not.

2341
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,290
But with,
but with women,

2342
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,660
with women,
they're their maternal.

2343
01:45:23,661 --> 01:45:26,360
They're nurturers there,
so it's not cool to see them get hurt.

2344
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:28,960
They blur the line a little bit when

2345
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:29,913
they tied the guy down and cut his dick 
off and threw it in the garbage 

2346
01:45:32,621 --> 01:45:35,500
disposal.
This is not a like a blurry line here.

2347
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:36,433
Alright,
this is.

2348
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:37,330
This is.
Okay.

2349
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:42,040
Joe Is in jail for the rest of her life 
because she chopped his dude's cock off.

2350
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:43,300
Hey Man.
It's just.

2351
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:46,150
I'm just saying it's weird that they 
thought it was okay to laugh about.

2352
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:47,013
It's not.
I mean it's horrific that people do 

2353
01:45:48,011 --> 01:45:48,844
horrific things to each other.
It's no more horrific than a woman does 

2354
01:45:51,071 --> 01:45:51,904
it to a man that Amanda's to a woman and
people have done horrible shit to women 

2355
01:45:54,430 --> 01:45:56,350
for forever.
But it's never funny.

2356
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,113
Did they make it funny?
Because a lot of people can make a lot 

2357
01:45:59,711 --> 01:46:00,670
of things funny.
Shane,

2358
01:46:00,671 --> 01:46:03,040
funny.
Ozzy Osbourne's wife.

2359
01:46:03,610 --> 01:46:04,720
Not very funny.
No,

2360
01:46:04,721 --> 01:46:06,400
it was just gross.
It was just mean.

2361
01:46:06,730 --> 01:46:08,650
But it was weird that all these women 
thought it was funny.

2362
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:10,510
They call,
he lost his dick.

2363
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:15,010
Like whoa.
Like it's seem real,

2364
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:17,410
but I guess it's also because like,
you know,

2365
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:18,423
like what you're saying,
it's like there's something funny about 

2366
01:46:20,891 --> 01:46:21,724
a man getting fucked up.
Like a lot of people feel like that 

2367
01:46:24,911 --> 01:46:25,744
about watching women fighting.
There's people that I know that are 

2368
01:46:28,541 --> 01:46:29,374
super uncomfortable.
It's like watching a Yoni and Jim Check 

2369
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:32,273
fight because she beats the fuck out of 
checks and balances are facing and cuts 

2370
01:46:35,081 --> 01:46:36,070
them up.
Right?

2371
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:37,850
Like,
do you watch a watch?

2372
01:46:38,290 --> 01:46:38,700
Major

2373
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:42,160
Fan of UFC?
I really fucking love that shit.

2374
01:46:42,190 --> 01:46:44,010
I think it's,
it's incredible.

2375
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:47,120
How not only did women,
you know,

2376
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:49,650
I mean Dana White said forever,
there will never be women.

2377
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:50,100
And then

2378
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:52,410
now not only are there women but there 
like the headliners,

2379
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:54,810
the headliners often.
Um,

2380
01:46:54,811 --> 01:46:58,560
this past weekend it was a co main event
that you want to check and it was a real

2381
01:46:58,561 --> 01:46:59,910
good fight because the woman she was 
fighting,

2382
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:02,430
which was tough as fuck and she took a 
serious beating,

2383
01:47:02,431 --> 01:47:05,760
but there was a fight that she did you 
want to check against?

2384
01:47:05,770 --> 01:47:07,380
Um,
see you pull up the highlights.

2385
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:12,750
A young Jay check versus Jessica Panay.
Try spelling her name.

2386
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:15,000
Good luck.
I don't even know how to support her.

2387
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:18,000
It's so hard to spell it into the people
just call her Yolanda champion.

2388
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:19,073
They don't even try with her last name 
because it's like aj and z and then a 

2389
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:22,673
fucking eat and then some letters that 
don't even exist in the English 

2390
01:47:25,051 --> 01:47:26,790
language.
But um,

2391
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:30,660
she beat this girl up so bad that it 
was,

2392
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:32,850
it was fucking disturbing.

2393
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:35,850
I mean,
she fucked this girl up.

2394
01:47:36,230 --> 01:47:37,850
She's,
yeah,

2395
01:47:38,270 --> 01:47:39,870
there's a lot of blood in this one.
Oh,

2396
01:47:39,871 --> 01:47:40,920
it's horrible.
Well,

2397
01:47:40,921 --> 01:47:44,280
the girl just just did not belong in the
ring with her.

2398
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:48,060
I mean in the cage with her.
She's from Holland.

2399
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,560
Poland,
Poland,

2400
01:47:49,610 --> 01:47:52,080
yeah.
Multiple time world champion.

2401
01:47:52,110 --> 01:47:52,943
She was before she ever got into mma,
she was one of the best strikers on the 

2402
01:47:55,171 --> 01:47:58,170
planet.
And if you go like deep into the fight,

2403
01:47:58,350 --> 01:47:59,183
she just packs her apart for the first 
couple of rounds and then by the time 

2404
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:02,933
you're deep in the ground,
she's just a mask of blood and you want 

2405
01:48:05,541 --> 01:48:06,374
to.
It's just beating the fuck out of her 

2406
01:48:08,161 --> 01:48:11,640
and smashing her in the face with elbows
and cutting her up.

2407
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:15,570
And then the final barrage when she,
when they stopped the fight,

2408
01:48:15,571 --> 01:48:18,060
like you see blood pouring out of her 
nose.

2409
01:48:18,061 --> 01:48:18,750
It's coming out.

2410
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:21,300
And the girl Jessica Panay all due 
credit to her.

2411
01:48:21,310 --> 01:48:22,900
That girl is tough as fuck.
Like,

2412
01:48:22,901 --> 01:48:23,734
look at this.
She is a mask of blood and swelling and 

2413
01:48:27,121 --> 01:48:29,790
you and Jay check is just a fucking 
demon.

2414
01:48:29,791 --> 01:48:32,970
She's just kicking at her and smashing 
her face.

2415
01:48:32,971 --> 01:48:34,920
And her face is,
comes from the other girl.

2416
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:35,813
Oh yeah.
Well she probably got hit a few times 

2417
01:48:36,991 --> 01:48:39,270
herself.
I mean it was a fight.

2418
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:41,460
I'm sure she got scratched and cut a 
little bit.

2419
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,520
Was just know if she got hit at all,
which I'm sure she did.

2420
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:45,443
But look at that,
that these short elbows like look at it 

2421
01:48:46,851 --> 01:48:49,140
across my face.
I mean it's just.

2422
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:50,183
And you see also that she's just having 
a hard time taking it and this is the 

2423
01:48:52,471 --> 01:48:54,570
final barrage.
She steps forward.

2424
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:59,100
Elbows are in the face and just boots 
dog shit out of her.

2425
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:00,173
And uh,
I had some friends that were watching 

2426
01:49:01,231 --> 01:49:03,480
this that weren't in a May fans and they
were like,

2427
01:49:03,481 --> 01:49:05,090
fuck this,
I can't watch this.

2428
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:06,160
Look at this.
Bang,

2429
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:07,950
Bang,
look at that.

2430
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:10,770
That was final barrage.
Oh,

2431
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:11,863
no way.
But I just had a lot of thoughts on the 

2432
01:49:15,781 --> 01:49:17,300
same time,
like thinking man,

2433
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:21,690
what an honor to sit next to Joe Rogan 
as he essentially commentates fight.

2434
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:24,480
Like a lot of people would want to do 
that.

2435
01:49:24,481 --> 01:49:24,811
And then,
uh,

2436
01:49:24,811 --> 01:49:26,320
and then I was,
you know,

2437
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,080
like,
I'm such a fan of yours,

2438
01:49:28,081 --> 01:49:28,914
you know,
and I don't want to keep spending years 

2439
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:31,980
to.
We're friends.

2440
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:34,170
We don't really have to talk like we're 
fans of each other.

2441
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:37,290
We're just buddies.
Then I thought,

2442
01:49:37,291 --> 01:49:38,124
fuck did this one coming up is an 
anaheim where a cormier and Jon Jones 

2443
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:46,890
exciting fucking thing is.
How do I want to.

2444
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:48,053
Yeah.

2445
01:49:48,450 --> 01:49:49,990
Oh Dude,
you're the man.

2446
01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:53,050
That's it.
I fucking love sitting right next to me.

2447
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:56,020
My Dad's gonna be in town to.
My Dad's going to do.

2448
01:49:56,150 --> 01:49:57,760
I'll give you two tickets.
One for your dad.

2449
01:49:58,030 --> 01:50:00,070
Ah,
fuck you and your dad.

2450
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:02,320
I want to meet your dad.
I want to try the store.

2451
01:50:02,321 --> 01:50:04,200
When you're 13,
you went to motley crew with them.

2452
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:06,093
My Dad's gods.
That wouldn't even be a priority for 

2453
01:50:08,111 --> 01:50:08,740
him.
I don't think.

2454
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:10,780
That's awesome.
That's cool.

2455
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:13,210
I am so excited.
I wanted to ask too,

2456
01:50:13,211 --> 01:50:14,340
like,
you know,

2457
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:16,630
for all the shit talking,
people have to promote the fights,

2458
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:21,850
but like Daniel Cormier and Jon Jones,
no matter who wins the end of the fight,

2459
01:50:21,851 --> 01:50:22,900
they're going to shake each other's 
hand.

2460
01:50:22,901 --> 01:50:24,000
Right.
I hope so.

2461
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:29,620
Is it common like what we saw with Ronda
Rousey not shaking me shit.

2462
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:31,863
Fucking armbar somebody they tap out and
then they get up and go to shake your 

2463
01:50:35,141 --> 01:50:37,900
hand and you won't do it like that.
Well,

2464
01:50:37,901 --> 01:50:40,330
I think that mentality that Rhonda has,

2465
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:44,750
she's like,
she's mercenary in there.

2466
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:45,613
I mean,
and it wasn't over when it was over to 

2467
01:50:47,031 --> 01:50:50,000
her for her wasn't a competition.
It was life.

2468
01:50:50,001 --> 01:50:51,830
It was,
it was life or death.

2469
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:53,143
I don't know man.
I mean that same thing is probably why 

2470
01:50:54,651 --> 01:50:56,390
she's not fighting anymore,
you know,

2471
01:50:56,450 --> 01:51:01,310
like her animosity and our emotions were
so riding on that thing.

2472
01:51:01,910 --> 01:51:02,743
And then when she lost,
and then when she lost again in 

2473
01:51:04,881 --> 01:51:05,714
devastating fashion,
that's also the reason why there was so 

2474
01:51:07,551 --> 01:51:10,850
much backlash.
Whereas someone who's really loved,

2475
01:51:10,851 --> 01:51:11,684
like randy coture,
randy couture would lose a fight and no 

2476
01:51:14,391 --> 01:51:15,081
one talked.
I mean,

2477
01:51:15,081 --> 01:51:15,914
I'm sure someone talked trash about him,
but no one's opinion of him deferred 

2478
01:51:18,651 --> 01:51:20,840
when he lost because you such a good 
guy.

2479
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:23,080
And because when he,
when he won,

2480
01:51:23,110 --> 01:51:24,080
you know,
after the fight,

2481
01:51:24,081 --> 01:51:26,570
he would always pick the guy up and 
shake their hand and hugged them.

2482
01:51:26,570 --> 01:51:27,403
And he was always a gentleman.
And when people have that sort of a 

2483
01:51:30,981 --> 01:51:32,630
mentality,
you know,

2484
01:51:32,631 --> 01:51:33,530
like,
here's a perfect example.

2485
01:51:33,531 --> 01:51:34,364
This past weekend,
Dustin poor ea and Eddie Alvarez had a 

2486
01:51:37,071 --> 01:51:37,904
fight and the fight was stopped because 
of an illegal blow that Eddie Alvarez 

2487
01:51:41,721 --> 01:51:44,540
accidentally landed on Dustin Poirier.
And the crowd was booing.

2488
01:51:44,541 --> 01:51:47,690
Eddie Alverez and Dustin poray yelled at
the crowd,

2489
01:51:47,691 --> 01:51:48,524
don't boo this man.
Like we were in a fight and he's not a 

2490
01:51:50,751 --> 01:51:52,980
dirty fighter.
And he made a mistake and they,

2491
01:51:53,660 --> 01:51:54,680
first of all,
Eddie Alvarez,

2492
01:51:54,681 --> 01:51:56,990
I was closed.
He could barely see.

2493
01:51:57,110 --> 01:51:57,943
He was completely on Queer Street,
he had been almost knocked unconscious 

2494
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:04,400
and he hit this dude in the clench with 
a couple of knees and the referee didn't

2495
01:52:04,401 --> 01:52:05,750
stop.
I mean he thought they were illegal,

2496
01:52:05,751 --> 01:52:08,660
you know,
he's in the chaos of a crazy cage fight,

2497
01:52:09,050 --> 01:52:12,470
but to have those two dudes after the 
fight,

2498
01:52:12,490 --> 01:52:13,323
bolt or bloody and battered,
both of them are just like exhausted 

2499
01:52:16,041 --> 01:52:17,150
from a war.
Right.

2500
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:18,253
And I'm interviewing the both of them 
side by side and to have dustin poirier 

2501
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:22,543
step in to defend Eddie Alvarez who just
need him illegally in the face telling 

2502
01:52:27,081 --> 01:52:28,970
the crowd,
don't boo this man.

2503
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:32,330
Like he was literally upset and then 
they shook hands.

2504
01:52:32,510 --> 01:52:35,280
There's something beautiful about that 
and I think people to me,

2505
01:52:35,281 --> 01:52:39,140
people like the animosity,
but they also really liked the fact when

2506
01:52:39,141 --> 01:52:41,810
the animosity squashed after the fight 
and people hug it out,

2507
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:42,800
they really do like that.

2508
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:44,110
Yeah.
And I think that there's.

2509
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:45,620
I think that there's a parallel

2510
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:50,090
with comedians who don't want to accept 
other comedians and then that.

2511
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:53,720
And then there's you who's just not 
insecure and wants more fucking comedy.

2512
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:56,060
I love comedy.
I love comedians.

2513
01:52:56,061 --> 01:52:56,894
There's some comedians that want to be 
the only person that's funny and they 

2514
01:52:58,431 --> 01:53:00,440
also bring people that suck with them on
the road.

2515
01:53:00,441 --> 01:53:02,510
That's one thing to say.
I can't stand it.

2516
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:04,750
Oh,
that's so common guys will do.

2517
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:05,593
They stack the deck,
they'll bring someone on the road with 

2518
01:53:06,801 --> 01:53:07,700
them.
That's terrible.

2519
01:53:08,210 --> 01:53:09,680
I tried to bring the funniest young 
guys.

2520
01:53:09,681 --> 01:53:11,120
I can find an Edwards.
Yeah,

2521
01:53:11,121 --> 01:53:12,770
Ian.
And this weekend Tony and Ian,

2522
01:53:12,771 --> 01:53:14,410
those guys are national headliners,
you know,

2523
01:53:14,411 --> 01:53:15,244
and,
but I bring both of them on the road 

2524
01:53:15,801 --> 01:53:16,634
with me.
I hadn't joined the years and I had one 

2525
01:53:18,411 --> 01:53:21,660
show and uh,
uh,

2526
01:53:21,850 --> 01:53:26,850
November 2011 and it was my first 
theater show in La and this was like,

2527
01:53:26,871 --> 01:53:29,750
I'm going to have everybody that matters
to me like every,

2528
01:53:29,770 --> 01:53:30,603
you know.

2529
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:33,950
And uh,
and I asked Ian Edwards to open for me.

2530
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:35,730
That's awesome.
And uh,

2531
01:53:36,170 --> 01:53:37,003
the fucking stoked.
He's an alum was just so struck that he 

2532
01:53:38,901 --> 01:53:42,740
even did it and I loved that.
He's so much better than me.

2533
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:43,763
He's a really fucking good guy too.
He's another guy that he spent too much 

2534
01:53:48,201 --> 01:53:49,034
time doing other things other than doing
standup and it was one of the things 

2535
01:53:52,551 --> 01:53:53,384
that I always tell comics,
so you've got to be careful of those 

2536
01:53:54,471 --> 01:53:57,770
honeypot jobs,
like writing for a show,

2537
01:53:57,830 --> 01:53:58,663
like a lot of really good comics wind up
losing their standup careers because 

2538
01:54:02,391 --> 01:54:04,390
they develop a writing career and they 
they,

2539
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:07,940
they look,
Ian should be a national headlight or in

2540
01:54:07,941 --> 01:54:08,774
big theaters all over the world.
He really all of the country and all 

2541
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:12,500
over the world who really should be,
he's that good,

2542
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:17,150
but because of the fact that he spent so
much time writing on sitcoms,

2543
01:54:17,510 --> 01:54:20,060
he didn't tour enough and he didn't put 
out enough material.

2544
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:23,120
Like he only has one cd out.
He's been doing comedy as long as me.

2545
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:26,810
Even Edwards and I started doing comedy 
together in 1990.

2546
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:28,033
That's when I met him.
I met him in 1990 or 91 in New York and 

2547
01:54:31,971 --> 01:54:32,804
I've known him for ever.
He was when I made my first video is 

2548
01:54:35,481 --> 01:54:37,070
1990.
Wow.

2549
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:38,960
It's a long time,
man.

2550
01:54:39,770 --> 01:54:41,300
Fuck that dude.
But yeah,

2551
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:45,140
my thoughts are that we should,
I mean if you like,

2552
01:54:45,230 --> 01:54:47,270
like everybody gets into comedy because 
they love it,

2553
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:48,560
right?
That's why you get into it.

2554
01:54:48,561 --> 01:54:50,660
You want,
you want to watch,

2555
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:53,910
you know,
you see a guy like dice clay or Kennison

2556
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:56,720
or prior or whoever it is that inspired 
you and you see them,

2557
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:58,700
Kevin Hart,
no name your per person.

2558
01:54:59,210 --> 01:55:00,880
You see them.
You want to be like,

2559
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:01,880
wow,
that was awesome.

2560
01:55:01,881 --> 01:55:03,410
I want to see that guy again.
You know,

2561
01:55:03,411 --> 01:55:04,400
and you want to go see comedy.

2562
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:06,650
And that's why.
That's why I got into it.

2563
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:07,513
Like to get into it and then all of a 
sudden they want to be the only one 

2564
01:55:09,831 --> 01:55:11,030
that's funny.
It's crazy.

2565
01:55:11,031 --> 01:55:12,230
To me,
it doesn't even make any sense.

2566
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:13,273
And to not like the other comedians.
It's just like you're robbing yourself 

2567
01:55:15,951 --> 01:55:18,800
of inspiration.
But there's a lot of comics like that.

2568
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:21,800
They won't watch the other comedians.
They don't want to see them.

2569
01:55:21,950 --> 01:55:24,140
And when the comics are doing good,
they get upset,

2570
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:25,570
you know,
they're like light,

2571
01:55:25,610 --> 01:55:26,460
um,
early let them earlier.

2572
01:55:26,461 --> 01:55:31,100
Like I've seen people say it's totally a
question of being insecure.

2573
01:55:31,730 --> 01:55:33,140
It definitely is.
It's also,

2574
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:34,390
I think it's,
it's a,

2575
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:38,480
it's a famine mindset.
And the famine mindset is this mindset.

2576
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:41,240
Like there can only be one,
like you could only be.

2577
01:55:41,241 --> 01:55:42,074
It can only all come to me.
It has to all come to me like no one 

2578
01:55:43,801 --> 01:55:43,980
else

2579
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,080
can,
but it's no.

2580
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:46,333
Who's that snoop Dogg Song Song.
It's no fun if the homies can't have 

2581
01:55:48,661 --> 01:55:51,600
some.
But it's true.

2582
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:54,050
You don't want to be the only one who's 
doing well.

2583
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:56,370
That's crazy.
It's just not a good thinking.

2584
01:55:56,430 --> 01:55:59,970
It's not a good way of thinking rather.
And Fuck,

2585
01:55:59,971 --> 01:56:02,620
I'm excited for,
for Anaheim.

2586
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:03,680
Oh,
you're going to have time.

2587
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:06,750
It's great car to.
As sad as it stands right now,

2588
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:11,820
there's a lot of issues.
I'm like getting these cards to actually

2589
01:56:11,850 --> 01:56:12,683
show,
like to play out because guys get 

2590
01:56:13,831 --> 01:56:16,380
injured,
they get disqualified or.

2591
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:18,420
Yeah.
But I mean when you're getting to.

2592
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:19,860
Yeah,
they get caught doing something.

2593
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,430
Yeah.
Sorry for interrupting that.

2594
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:24,930
I watched that hurt business documentary
on Netflix.

2595
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:29,990
I haven't seen Daniel cormier the 
fucking like a knee injury and is trying

2596
01:56:30,451 --> 01:56:35,310
to get healthy again and fuck that 
documentaries and I haven't seen it.

2597
01:56:36,330 --> 01:56:38,280
It's so incredible.
Like the way,

2598
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:40,860
I mean almost like the focus of it is I 
get,

2599
01:56:40,861 --> 01:56:41,694
we're going to spotlight like a number 
of these personalities from the UFC and 

2600
01:56:45,061 --> 01:56:47,220
really showed us how fucking tragic it 
is.

2601
01:56:47,221 --> 01:56:49,630
They put so much into it and then they,
you know,

2602
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:52,920
they had their careers for whatever it's
worth.

2603
01:56:52,921 --> 01:56:53,754
And then when it's all said and done,
they just got nothing to fucking show 

2604
01:56:56,011 --> 01:56:57,820
for it and it's just so fucking trash.

2605
01:56:58,260 --> 01:56:59,093
Well,
you can't think that you're going to 

2606
01:57:00,121 --> 01:57:02,010
have something to show for it.
That's the thing.

2607
01:57:02,011 --> 01:57:06,240
If you're lucky and you become a condom,
mcgregor who is like one in a million or

2608
01:57:06,241 --> 01:57:07,490
you become,
you know,

2609
01:57:07,491 --> 01:57:08,324
uh,
George St Pierre who retires as the 

2610
01:57:09,271 --> 01:57:10,310
champion.
You're,

2611
01:57:10,311 --> 01:57:12,030
you're really,
really unusual.

2612
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:14,640
But for everyone else,
you have to do it because you love doing

2613
01:57:14,641 --> 01:57:15,474
it.
And if you do it because you love doing 

2614
01:57:16,741 --> 01:57:17,574
it and that's what you want to do,
then you should do it and you will bank 

2615
01:57:19,051 --> 01:57:19,884
a lot of money if you're successful.
But there's this thing that people have 

2616
01:57:23,371 --> 01:57:25,920
when they see a guy like floyd 
mayweather and they say,

2617
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:26,933
well,
hey,

2618
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:28,553
boxers make millions of dollars.
Look Floyd me whether made hundreds of 

2619
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:31,490
millions of dollars.
No,

2620
01:57:31,490 --> 01:57:31,711
no,
no,

2621
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:32,340
no,
no.

2622
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:35,100
Floyd mayweather makes hundreds of 
millions of dollars.

2623
01:57:35,101 --> 01:57:37,970
Not Boxers,
like Gennady Golovkin who,

2624
01:57:37,971 --> 01:57:39,660
who's one of the best boxers in the 
world.

2625
01:57:39,810 --> 01:57:43,820
He can't even sell 200,000 paper views 
like his last paper view by,

2626
01:57:43,950 --> 01:57:45,830
I think it was like a hundred and 
50,000,

2627
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:46,913
which is insanely low to the point where
it's very difficult for promoters even 

2628
01:57:51,151 --> 01:57:53,820
get behind him unless he's fighting 
someone like Canelo Alvarez,

2629
01:57:53,821 --> 01:57:54,654
which is his next fight,
will he'll make some money in that 

2630
01:57:56,341 --> 01:57:57,174
fight,
but guarantee you he ain't making very 

2631
01:57:59,131 --> 01:57:59,964
good money.

2632
01:58:00,010 --> 01:58:02,310
Like with a hundred and 50,000 paper 
views.

2633
01:58:02,370 --> 01:58:07,370
And he's a multiple time world champion 
and like a fantastic amateur fighter.

2634
01:58:07,910 --> 01:58:08,743
One of the best in the world.
It's about being a star and a promoter 

2635
01:58:12,451 --> 01:58:13,284
is not responsible to give a fighter a 
bunch of money if they're not earning a 

2636
01:58:16,351 --> 01:58:17,184
bunch of money.
It's a business and the business is 

2637
01:58:18,990 --> 01:58:21,510
people want to pay to see you.
Why do they want to see you?

2638
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:22,573
Do they want to see you because you 
trash talk or do they want to see you 

2639
01:58:24,331 --> 01:58:26,180
because you're Anderson Silva and you'll
fight like you're in.

2640
01:58:26,181 --> 01:58:29,710
You're in the matrix or do they want to 
see you because you're Ronda Rousey?

2641
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:32,310
The first ever woman asked kicker that 
we've ever seen like this.

2642
01:58:32,530 --> 01:58:33,363
Well,
whatever reason it is that they want to 

2643
01:58:34,291 --> 01:58:35,124
see you.
That reason is why you can make a shit 

2644
01:58:38,101 --> 01:58:38,820
ton of money.

2645
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:43,240
It's not that you just deserve a shit 
ton of money because it's hard to do and

2646
01:58:43,241 --> 01:58:46,480
that's where a lot of people get that 
wrong in their head.

2647
01:58:46,570 --> 01:58:48,040
They get that wrong in their head.
Well,

2648
01:58:48,041 --> 01:58:50,200
it's show business,
but it's also athletics,

2649
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:53,230
so it's a very bizarre combination of 
two worlds.

2650
01:58:53,290 --> 01:58:54,123
Do you think that conor mcgregor is 
doing a disservice to myself by putting 

2651
01:58:56,621 --> 01:58:57,454
so much attention on,
like just putting his whole UFC career 

2652
01:59:00,641 --> 01:59:03,460
on hold for this mayweather thing?
No.

2653
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,940
Um,
because ultimately he can only fight for

2654
01:59:06,941 --> 01:59:10,540
so long and he stands to win.
Who knows how much money?

2655
01:59:10,541 --> 01:59:13,770
I mean he can make.
It could be as much as $100,000,000 sort

2656
01:59:13,771 --> 01:59:14,604
of fight.
It's going to be insane asking you guys 

2657
01:59:16,050 --> 01:59:18,940
to pass up on the opportunity to make 
$100,000,000 is kind of crazy.

2658
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:23,760
That said he's fighting boxing.
No,

2659
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:24,250
no,
no.

2660
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:24,730
It doesn't matter.

2661
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:29,380
It's not.
The way boxing works is you get a purse,

2662
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:30,303
you know,
like the way UFC works is different and 

2663
01:59:32,291 --> 01:59:36,760
often criticized and I think rightly so 
is that you have a wind money and a show

2664
01:59:36,761 --> 01:59:37,594
money.
So say if you were going to fight Jamie 

2665
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:41,890
and they set it up where you,
uh,

2666
01:59:41,891 --> 01:59:42,724
you fight,
you make $50,000 to show and then 

2667
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:46,594
another 50 if you win.
A lot of people have a real hard time 

2668
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:51,580
with that and I think they should 
because you're doing your best.

2669
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:54,460
You're giving your best performance 
regardless of whether or not you win.

2670
01:59:54,461 --> 01:59:57,010
No one's going to fight harder,
I don't think,

2671
01:59:57,070 --> 02:00:00,070
at least to get that wind bonus.
These guys are trying to win.

2672
02:00:00,071 --> 02:00:01,870
They're fucking gladiators,
you know?

2673
02:00:01,871 --> 02:00:04,420
I mean,
I think you should have a purse and that

2674
02:00:04,421 --> 02:00:05,254
should be what you get paid and you 
fight your best and that's what you get 

2675
02:00:08,051 --> 02:00:08,350
paid.

2676
02:00:08,350 --> 02:00:11,370
Like this idea that you're double is 
gonna,

2677
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:14,530
you know you're going to come your way 
if you get the judge's nod.

2678
02:00:14,660 --> 02:00:15,493
Meanwhile the judges get shit wrong all 
the time and to have your future like 

2679
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:20,913
have $50,000 or 100 that or who knows 
what the number is on the line due to 

2680
02:00:24,761 --> 02:00:28,780
someone else's interpretation of it.
Or you can get injured and one up losing

2681
02:00:28,781 --> 02:00:29,614
or anything of that.
But like I think that's kind of fucked 

2682
02:00:30,701 --> 02:00:32,770
up.
The thing about the condom mcgregor,

2683
02:00:32,771 --> 02:00:33,820
floyd mayweather fight.
If,

2684
02:00:33,821 --> 02:00:35,140
if,
if it's tennis,

2685
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:37,300
you'd get the money if you win.
Yeah,

2686
02:00:37,301 --> 02:00:38,590
but that's different.
First of all,

2687
02:00:38,591 --> 02:00:39,780
it's not a fight.
Okay.

2688
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:42,130
Because you can play tennis.
Match every weekend.

2689
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:44,440
Try fighting every weekend.
We'd be dead in a month.

2690
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:45,600
You know,
a cure.

2691
02:00:45,610 --> 02:00:46,870
This US president.
Yeah,

2692
02:00:46,871 --> 02:00:50,110
they agreed to sign a deal with Florida.
That doesn't mean anything because floyd

2693
02:00:50,111 --> 02:00:51,190
mayweather hasn't agreed to.

2694
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:53,710
The deal has been negotiated.
Connor has agreed,

2695
02:00:54,220 --> 02:00:56,380
so that's what that means,
but here's the deal.

2696
02:00:56,410 --> 02:00:58,810
Let's be honest about this as much as 
possible.

2697
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:01,600
This is a boxing match between conor 
Mcgregor,

2698
02:01:01,601 --> 02:01:03,660
a guy who's never had a real 
professional boxing match.

2699
02:01:03,661 --> 02:01:04,494
It was a really good amateur boxer,
an hour in Ireland who is a real 

2700
02:01:07,930 --> 02:01:10,690
multiple division world champion,
combat sports fighter.

2701
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:12,940
No doubt about that,
but an a striker,

2702
02:01:12,970 --> 02:01:13,803
no doubt about that,
but he's fighting one of the best 

2703
02:01:15,611 --> 02:01:18,340
boxers,
if not the best boxer ever.

2704
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:21,880
Most likely.
This is not gonna work out well for him.

2705
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:26,020
If you had to guess,
that's my honest take on it.

2706
02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:29,980
The only way it could work out well is 
if floyd takes them lightly.

2707
02:01:30,490 --> 02:01:31,420
Conocophillips.
Him,

2708
02:01:31,740 --> 02:01:34,150
connor mugs him kind of does some like 
old school.

2709
02:01:34,151 --> 02:01:36,730
Bernard Hopkins,
Shit like this ties him up.

2710
02:01:36,910 --> 02:01:41,320
Rough sum up inside the clench,
hits them with some real hard shots or,

2711
02:01:41,390 --> 02:01:43,010
or does something fucked up to them.

2712
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:43,701
I mean,
who knows,

2713
02:01:43,701 --> 02:01:44,511
had bought some.
I mean,

2714
02:01:44,511 --> 02:01:45,950
that's what Victor Ortiz tried to do to 
him.

2715
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:48,160
I guess you can also say that,
um,

2716
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:51,020
that uh,
he doesn't really stand there.

2717
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:53,460
It's a win win for connor because if he 
loses,

2718
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:54,840
of course he was going to lose.
Yeah.

2719
02:01:55,040 --> 02:02:00,040
And also floyd is not a vicious puncher.
Floyd's not knowing.

2720
02:02:00,531 --> 02:02:02,000
Never was.
No,

2721
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:03,240
no,
he never was he.

2722
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:06,410
He is an amazing boxer,
but he was very brittle.

2723
02:02:06,411 --> 02:02:07,244
Hands.
He breaks his hands a lot and he can 

2724
02:02:08,721 --> 02:02:10,380
knock you out like you knocked out 
Victoria.

2725
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:12,950
But he knocked out victorious because 
you're just standing in front of him.

2726
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:15,680
He knocked out ricky Hatton who is a 
smaller fighter,

2727
02:02:15,850 --> 02:02:18,710
but he doesn't knock out most guys.
He stuns them,

2728
02:02:18,711 --> 02:02:19,544
he sticks them with some hard shots.
But Connor has got a really good chin 

2729
02:02:22,031 --> 02:02:23,600
and he's a much bigger guy.

2730
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:26,480
So the odds are if even if connor gets 
worked,

2731
02:02:26,690 --> 02:02:31,180
he's just going to get out boxed for 12 
rounds and get embarrassed and just with

2732
02:02:31,181 --> 02:02:32,014
at a bunch of punches and flow is not 
going to be anywhere near him or he can 

2733
02:02:34,701 --> 02:02:37,120
catch him.
I mean it is possible that you can catch

2734
02:02:37,121 --> 02:02:37,954
them,
but it's not likely the odds are going 

2735
02:02:40,311 --> 02:02:42,980
to be huge in floyd made with his 
favorite.

2736
02:02:43,460 --> 02:02:46,490
If I had a gas it's going to be like 20 
to one or something crazy like that.

2737
02:02:47,870 --> 02:02:52,190
I'm not an odds maker but.
But I do know movement and I know boxing

2738
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:55,040
and just just,
just a big difference between what a guy

2739
02:02:55,041 --> 02:02:55,874
like floyd mayweather can do and a guy 
like conor can do when it comes to the 

2740
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:02,720
actual boxing skills.
But there's also,

2741
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:03,713
there's another factor too that connor 
has been fighting with small gloves and 

2742
02:03:06,710 --> 02:03:08,150
I was going to be fighting with larger 
gloves.

2743
02:03:08,330 --> 02:03:10,340
What size?
Gloves they agree on for the fight.

2744
02:03:10,341 --> 02:03:11,174
If Floyd smart,
he's going to make them fight with 10 

2745
02:03:12,471 --> 02:03:13,900
ounce gloves,
you know,

2746
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:16,730
because probably connor will want to 
watch were eight.

2747
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:17,773
I Dunno what,
what weight class they have the cutoff 

2748
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:20,203
in like a lighter weight classes.
They use eight ounce gloves and heavier 

2749
02:03:23,781 --> 02:03:25,670
these 10 ounce gloves,
you know,

2750
02:03:25,790 --> 02:03:26,623
so it's like that was a stipulation in 
the Marvin Hagler and sugar Ray Leonard 

2751
02:03:29,181 --> 02:03:30,014
Fight Sugar Ray Leonard wanted the 
bigger gloves when a heavier gloves 

2752
02:03:32,091 --> 02:03:34,760
because he's fighting a big heavy 
puncher like Hagler,

2753
02:03:35,090 --> 02:03:38,840
so they might make some sort of a 
decision to go with larger gloves,

2754
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:39,913
but floyd's a fucking 49 and oh,
multiple division world boxing champion 

2755
02:03:46,371 --> 02:03:48,410
and connor has never had a professional 
boxing fight.

2756
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:51,470
That's really what it is.
It's interesting.

2757
02:03:51,530 --> 02:03:53,750
I mean I want to see it.
Don't make no mistake about it.

2758
02:03:53,751 --> 02:03:56,630
When the first bell rings,
I'll have my popcorn ready,

2759
02:03:56,631 --> 02:03:57,464
bro.

2760
02:03:57,700 --> 02:04:00,230
Well you'll probably be right there.
I don't think so.

2761
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:01,340
No,
I think it be home.

2762
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,560
Yeah,
I think I'll be watching that from home.

2763
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:06,500
I think that's a.
whoever does commentary on that.

2764
02:04:06,501 --> 02:04:07,334
It's going to be probably boxing people.
It's like if you had Max Kellerman and 

2765
02:04:10,551 --> 02:04:15,551
Jim Lampley doing commentary on Floyd 
Mayweather fighting conor mcgregor in an

2766
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:17,780
mma fight,
I think that would be an embarrassment.

2767
02:04:17,990 --> 02:04:21,500
That'd be ridiculous.
Just as ridiculous as it would be for me

2768
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:24,920
to do commentary on Connor Fighting 
Floyd in a boxing match.

2769
02:04:25,490 --> 02:04:30,490
Unless they wanted to have a combination
of an MMA judge and a or an mma,

2770
02:04:30,801 --> 02:04:33,470
a commentator and a box and commentator 
maybe.

2771
02:04:33,890 --> 02:04:35,490
Perhaps I would do it with Max 
Kellerman.

2772
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,290
I'm a big fan of that guy.
Like that guy a lot.

2773
02:04:37,410 --> 02:04:38,550
I think that would be kind of 
interesting,

2774
02:04:38,670 --> 02:04:40,860
but most likely I'll be at home watching
it.

2775
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:44,010
You know,
I'd like to see it live.

2776
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:47,760
Maybe I'm like maybe sit ringside.
We'd be kind of interesting to see that.

2777
02:04:48,030 --> 02:04:48,863
It's going to be a crazy,
interesting experience to see what 

2778
02:04:50,791 --> 02:04:51,624
connor can do and I know he's been 
working like almost exclusively on his 

2779
02:04:55,051 --> 02:04:58,200
boxing for months and months and months 
in preparation for this.

2780
02:04:59,130 --> 02:05:02,370
Here's the thing that mother fucker can 
put you into orbit with one punch.

2781
02:05:02,610 --> 02:05:04,110
That's a fact.
You know,

2782
02:05:04,111 --> 02:05:06,630
like if you look at this past weekend is
a perfect example.

2783
02:05:06,631 --> 02:05:10,920
When I said I'm about Eddie Alvarez and 
Dustin poray having this crazy war.

2784
02:05:11,510 --> 02:05:15,690
Connor worked both of those guys with 
one punch with,

2785
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:16,533
I mean with Eddie.
He softened him up with a few punches 

2786
02:05:18,331 --> 02:05:19,950
before he marked him,
but he,

2787
02:05:19,951 --> 02:05:20,784
he had him on Queer Street with one 
punch and he murked dustin poirier with 

2788
02:05:24,661 --> 02:05:26,430
one punch.
I mean he's just,

2789
02:05:26,431 --> 02:05:29,630
he hits fucking hard.
This,

2790
02:05:29,631 --> 02:05:30,464
this guy for Rasa hobbies,
a very famous mma coach and he said it 

2791
02:05:32,941 --> 02:05:33,270
best.

2792
02:05:33,270 --> 02:05:35,310
He said,
connor has a touch of death.

2793
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:37,680
Like he just,
he just fucking,

2794
02:05:37,950 --> 02:05:38,783
he just collapsed dudes in Zap.
Some ridiculous speed and accuracy and 

2795
02:05:43,921 --> 02:05:47,020
when he does your Foxville,
the question is whether or not it can be

2796
02:05:47,021 --> 02:05:52,021
able to do that to floyd motherfucking 
mayweather and most likely it's going to

2797
02:05:52,831 --> 02:05:55,350
be nowhere near him when those punches 
come flying.

2798
02:05:55,351 --> 02:05:59,130
I mean he's a wizard ever watched like 
Floyd Mayweather,

2799
02:05:59,131 --> 02:05:59,964
defensive highlight reel,
but it's just him kind of running 

2800
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:05,610
backward know him just moving away from 
punches,

2801
02:06:05,611 --> 02:06:07,380
bending at the hips.
He's not a runner,

2802
02:06:07,510 --> 02:06:09,350
so he flew.
People think of Floyd's or runner.

2803
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:12,150
Floyd doesn't run.
He's not like running away from guys who

2804
02:06:12,151 --> 02:06:12,984
stands right in front of Dude's.
He stands right in front of dudes and 

2805
02:06:15,631 --> 02:06:17,940
maybe backs up slightly or moves to the 
side,

2806
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:19,073
but he's just so knowledgeable when it 
comes to boxing and he has such a deep 

2807
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:24,293
understanding of where to be at the 
right time and where the punches can 

2808
02:06:27,001 --> 02:06:27,810
come from.

2809
02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:28,643
The left comes from here,
that means a right to come in this way 

2810
02:06:30,121 --> 02:06:30,954
and he's nowhere near that.
He's over here and that means after the 

2811
02:06:32,731 --> 02:06:36,870
right look like what can you stand in 
front of them when you watch him,

2812
02:06:36,930 --> 02:06:39,630
the way he's able to like slide out of 
the way a shit.

2813
02:06:40,110 --> 02:06:43,500
I mean dudes just don't fucking hit him 
very often.

2814
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:48,680
He's been hit least or less than any 
world champion that's had 49 fights.

2815
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:55,170
I would say that he probably has the 
most successful defensive career and the

2816
02:06:55,171 --> 02:06:57,180
history of boxing.
He's,

2817
02:06:57,680 --> 02:07:01,710
I mean he's literally been tagged hard 
maybe five,

2818
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:02,633
six times in his entire career and he 
stands in front of some of the best 

2819
02:07:05,431 --> 02:07:06,264
fighters in the world,
like Canelo Alvarez mean Canelo was 

2820
02:07:08,581 --> 02:07:12,030
younger than it was a few years ago and 
Canelo wasn't as good as he is now,

2821
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:13,253
but he just stands right in front of 
guys and pop them in the face and just 

2822
02:07:15,901 --> 02:07:17,130
understands how to move.

2823
02:07:17,190 --> 02:07:18,023
Like that kind of shit.
Like when you watching this highlight 

2824
02:07:20,071 --> 02:07:20,904
reel,
you watch them master like young 

2825
02:07:22,681 --> 02:07:24,450
fighters.
They should,

2826
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:25,493
they should watch his defensive 
movements and abilities I think almost 

2827
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:31,290
above all others,
except now this new guy,

2828
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:34,800
facility Loma Chenko,
who I think his rivals,

2829
02:07:34,801 --> 02:07:37,240
anybody that's ever lived in terms of 
his movement,

2830
02:07:37,241 --> 02:07:39,990
his ability to move and his,
his positioning and footwork.

2831
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,850
I think he's as good as it's ever been,
but you know,

2832
02:07:42,851 --> 02:07:46,120
he is only got like nine professional 
fights or something like that.

2833
02:07:46,121 --> 02:07:46,954
He just hasn't really.
Luckily this Oscar de la Hoya standard 

2834
02:07:50,111 --> 02:07:51,690
right in front of him and he can't 
fucking head him.

2835
02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:55,150
He's throwing all these punches like you
that mom won my mail Marquez,

2836
02:07:55,270 --> 02:07:57,730
he pops them and just swooped slides 
right out of the way.

2837
02:07:57,731 --> 02:07:58,810
Sorry,
not here.

2838
02:07:59,890 --> 02:08:04,180
And unbelievable work ethic like Floyd 
Mayweather will go to a club,

2839
02:08:04,330 --> 02:08:06,490
go to a nightclub in Vegas,
hang out,

2840
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:08,770
drink water,
hang out with everybody,

2841
02:08:08,771 --> 02:08:09,760
get all the accolades.

2842
02:08:09,780 --> 02:08:14,780
Ladies and gentlemen floored everybody 
goes crazy.

2843
02:08:15,251 --> 02:08:17,170
Lights in hundred dollar bills.
Then he know what he does.

2844
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:19,870
People will drive his Rolls Royce and 
he'll run.

2845
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:20,913
He'll run the vegas strip of run miles 
and then go to the gym 3:00 in the 

2846
02:08:23,771 --> 02:08:26,200
morning and do fucking 15 rounds in the 
heavy bag.

2847
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:28,390
He's an animal.
I mean his,

2848
02:08:28,391 --> 02:08:29,224
his work ethic and his mind and his 
determination and focus and I guarantee 

2849
02:08:33,131 --> 02:08:33,760
you,
man,

2850
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:37,000
if he's getting ready for Floyd,
mayweather is getting ready for.

2851
02:08:37,001 --> 02:08:39,940
I'm conor Mcgregor.
He's going to be in tip top shape again,

2852
02:08:39,941 --> 02:08:40,540
man.
He's not.

2853
02:08:40,540 --> 02:08:42,250
He's never going to come in and slept 
in.

2854
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:43,893
It's gonna.
Be Fun.

2855
02:08:44,110 --> 02:08:44,943
But why has he got to be so such a Dick?
Because that's how I made all that 

2856
02:08:47,771 --> 02:08:48,604
money.
It's because we were talking about 

2857
02:08:49,031 --> 02:08:49,864
before,
like what it like the shell business is 

2858
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:52,133
the show business aspect of it is having
p like he used to be pretty boy floyd 

2859
02:08:56,261 --> 02:08:56,920
mayweather.

2860
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:57,753
That's it.
They used to call them but it wasn't 

2861
02:08:58,641 --> 02:09:00,100
really making any money.
You know,

2862
02:09:00,101 --> 02:09:04,060
he became rich when he became floyd.
Money Mayweather when he started talking

2863
02:09:04,061 --> 02:09:07,030
all this shit and people want him to get
his ass kicked and he wasn't getting his

2864
02:09:07,031 --> 02:09:09,070
ass kicked.
Like people are paying to see him.

2865
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:10,473
Not necessarily because they like 
they're paying to see him because they 

2866
02:09:12,971 --> 02:09:13,804
want to see them get fucked up because 
he's a huge star and it became a huge 

2867
02:09:16,751 --> 02:09:19,810
star by fucking with people talking a 
lot of shit.

2868
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:20,853
Talking about a gradient is showing all 
of his watches and all of his jewelry 

2869
02:09:24,011 --> 02:09:24,844
and all.
He's got this crazy house in Vegas and 

2870
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:27,993
you know,
it's the,

2871
02:09:28,190 --> 02:09:29,023
it's really the controversy like 
domestic violence through went to jail 

2872
02:09:31,721 --> 02:09:33,340
for beating up girls.
You know,

2873
02:09:33,341 --> 02:09:34,174
like there's a lot of controversy 
involved in him and that's one of the 

2874
02:09:37,271 --> 02:09:38,920
reasons why people wanted to see him 
fight.

2875
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:40,360
They want to see him lose.

2876
02:09:42,430 --> 02:09:44,680
He didn't lose.
He went all the way to the bank.

2877
02:09:44,681 --> 02:09:45,514
I mean he tied rocky Marciano's record 
for having the most successful fights 

2878
02:09:49,121 --> 02:09:50,830
ever.
Forty $9,

2879
02:09:50,831 --> 02:09:52,960
zero as a champion.
It's not unheard of.

2880
02:09:53,260 --> 02:09:54,093
Unheard of.
And Rocky Marciano's record is bullshit 

2881
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:57,633
because rocky Marciano Italians right 
now going crazy with the rubbish dump 

2882
02:10:01,860 --> 02:10:02,693
past.
It's pretty much agree that rocky 

2883
02:10:04,901 --> 02:10:09,160
Marciano fought his brother and at least
one fight early in his career.

2884
02:10:09,970 --> 02:10:13,120
So it was like a fake fight to pull that
up.

2885
02:10:13,330 --> 02:10:15,040
See if you've.
That's been,

2886
02:10:15,730 --> 02:10:19,060
that's been validated.
I'm pretty sure I've read that,

2887
02:10:19,330 --> 02:10:24,330
that rocky Marciano had like a fixed 
fight with his brother back in the day.

2888
02:10:24,701 --> 02:10:25,534
You know,
like a guy like rocky Marciano was a 

2889
02:10:26,801 --> 02:10:27,634
murderous puncher.
It's probably like he would show up for 

2890
02:10:28,781 --> 02:10:29,614
fighting.
People didn't want to fight them and 

2891
02:10:30,540 --> 02:10:31,740
like the people that paid to see him,
like,

2892
02:10:31,741 --> 02:10:32,780
what are we going to do?
I'm like,

2893
02:10:32,781 --> 02:10:33,890
damn my brother,
I'll get in there.

2894
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:37,130
So his brother gets in there and it goes
down to a body shot or something.

2895
02:10:37,850 --> 02:10:39,410
I don't know.
I don't know how it played out,

2896
02:10:39,411 --> 02:10:42,860
but we're lucky we're not in that 
business.

2897
02:10:42,861 --> 02:10:43,694
Do you think you have brain damage from 
Tim Kennedy dropping you off in your 

2898
02:10:46,821 --> 02:10:47,654
head?
How about just getting flooded in the 

2899
02:10:49,911 --> 02:10:52,100
head by some of the best fighters in the
world?

2900
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:54,650
I think I'm in pretty good shape with 
all that.

2901
02:10:54,710 --> 02:10:56,370
Seemed fun.
Look,

2902
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:57,223
Anthony Rumble Johnson,
who was one of the best fighters in the 

2903
02:10:59,091 --> 02:10:59,924
world,
just retired and he did an interview 

2904
02:11:01,191 --> 02:11:04,250
recently and uh,
today the interview came out.

2905
02:11:04,251 --> 02:11:07,420
We said brain damage is a big concern 
and he's a guy,

2906
02:11:07,470 --> 02:11:10,340
gives everybody brain damage.
Have you ever seen rumble fight?

2907
02:11:11,130 --> 02:11:13,940
Most terrifying knockout artists in mma?
In my opinion.

2908
02:11:14,240 --> 02:11:17,060
And he retired because he's worried 
about someone doing that to him.

2909
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:18,920
He's like,
I don't want brain damage.

2910
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:20,240
He was like,
I want,

2911
02:11:20,300 --> 02:11:23,120
I want other things in my life.
It was also interesting because he's one

2912
02:11:23,121 --> 02:11:24,890
of the best fighters in the world and he
said,

2913
02:11:24,891 --> 02:11:26,060
I'm not really a fighter.
He goes,

2914
02:11:26,061 --> 02:11:27,740
I'm an athlete.
It was really good at fighting.

2915
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:31,220
I thought it was fascinating because it 
shows so much awareness.

2916
02:11:31,250 --> 02:11:32,083
Shows what a smart guy he is,
but he's really kind of aware of who he 

2917
02:11:34,701 --> 02:11:37,430
is.
Fuck that dude.

2918
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:41,010
So Anaheim you.
They're down a suicide.

2919
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:43,610
It's a good one too.
I hope nobody fucks up before the fight.

2920
02:11:44,250 --> 02:11:45,980
They almost kind of brought this past 
weekend.

2921
02:11:46,580 --> 02:11:49,220
You should check out that show the 
business business.

2922
02:11:49,460 --> 02:11:52,010
This past weekend,
Daniel Cormay hit John Jones in the face

2923
02:11:52,011 --> 02:11:52,844
with a water bottle at a press 
conference and John Tried to chuck one 

2924
02:11:55,551 --> 02:11:56,384
at him and they almost bald and people 
got water bottles at the press 

2925
02:11:58,911 --> 02:11:59,744
conferences.
Well they now they drained the monster 

2926
02:12:02,361 --> 02:12:03,194
energy cans.
So when you see those monster energy 

2927
02:12:04,671 --> 02:12:06,730
drinks that are sitting there on the 
dance,

2928
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:09,620
those are fake.
The real monster energy drinks,

2929
02:12:09,621 --> 02:12:12,230
but they have to drink them all or empty
them out before they get up there.

2930
02:12:12,790 --> 02:12:13,623
Right.

2931
02:12:15,530 --> 02:12:17,520
So exciting.
It's so exciting.

2932
02:12:17,580 --> 02:12:18,413
Just the this John John's.
That was so interesting that that a 

2933
02:12:22,580 --> 02:12:26,090
press conference where Jon Jones is 
talking all the positive like,

2934
02:12:26,091 --> 02:12:26,924
no,
I want to show that you can get back on 

2935
02:12:27,741 --> 02:12:30,480
your feet and then says,
wait,

2936
02:12:30,700 --> 02:12:31,533
hold on a second.
These backstage you telling me I'm the 

2937
02:12:33,081 --> 02:12:35,420
biggest puts he ever saw and then 
they'd.

2938
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:37,060
Yeah,
that's fascinating.

2939
02:12:37,070 --> 02:12:37,903
The way that played out.
Well John is starting to come clean now 

2940
02:12:39,710 --> 02:12:40,543
trying to be more of himself and this 
past weekend they had a press 

2941
02:12:42,321 --> 02:12:43,154
conference.
He said that he was fucking doing 

2942
02:12:44,181 --> 02:12:46,040
cocaine all weekend long before he beat 
him.

2943
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:47,083
Well,
Dennis said Danny was talking all this 

2944
02:12:49,191 --> 02:12:50,024
shit.
What is this fight even though that 

2945
02:12:50,570 --> 02:12:51,403
happened?
Who knows if John gets caught doing 

2946
02:12:53,181 --> 02:12:57,410
cocaine or sandblast and a prostitute.
What is sandblasting?

2947
02:12:57,680 --> 02:13:00,590
But it's hilarious.
Hilarious term.

2948
02:13:01,450 --> 02:13:02,283
Dale's funny man.
I did commentary within this funny 

2949
02:13:06,411 --> 02:13:09,260
fucking dude man.
That on your story.

2950
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:09,941
Yeah,
yeah.

2951
02:13:09,941 --> 02:13:12,230
Yeah.
And so anyway,

2952
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:16,040
when John said that I beat you after I 
did cocaine for a weekend,

2953
02:13:16,510 --> 02:13:18,380
but it was like,
oh shit.

2954
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:21,350
It's like I liked that John is being 
himself.

2955
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:22,293
That's,
that's,

2956
02:13:22,490 --> 02:13:26,560
that'll serve him better than all this 
fake shit.

2957
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:30,260
Like I'm just a good guy and uplifting.
Yeah.

2958
02:13:30,261 --> 02:13:32,010
Well he doesn't want to be to,

2959
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:34,770
but when it comes to like actual 
fighting,

2960
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:38,460
he's a fucking straight up killer.
Jon Jones is a killer.

2961
02:13:38,670 --> 02:13:39,391
That's,
I mean,

2962
02:13:39,391 --> 02:13:43,110
you don't get to be the youngest ever 
UFC champion if you're not a killer.

2963
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:44,850
He got,
he showed up.

2964
02:13:45,150 --> 02:13:47,820
He fought Mauricio Shogun who,
uh,

2965
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:51,240
in his UFC title fight,
who is a legend in Brazil.

2966
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:52,253
His opening move was a flying knee.
He threw a flying knee and Maricio 

2967
02:13:56,930 --> 02:13:58,290
Shogun Hua.
That is just crazy.

2968
02:13:58,950 --> 02:13:59,783
I mean,
you have to be such a gangster to even 

2969
02:14:01,261 --> 02:14:04,320
think about doing that to a guy like 
she's not feeling feeling amount.

2970
02:14:04,470 --> 02:14:08,550
He just leapt in and through a fucking 
flying knee it show guns face and caught

2971
02:14:08,551 --> 02:14:13,551
him and beat his ass and stopped him 
when he was like 22 won the world title,

2972
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:15,270
Ms Dot.
It was bananas,

2973
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:17,730
you know,
John was something special and still is,

2974
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:19,800
but it's gonna,
you know,

2975
02:14:20,010 --> 02:14:21,540
it's going to be a Ra,
a long,

2976
02:14:21,541 --> 02:14:23,280
tough fight with him and cormier this 
time.

2977
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:26,310
I think it's going to be fun.
It's going to be there.

2978
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:27,101
I can't wait.
Yeah,

2979
02:14:27,101 --> 02:14:28,710
I just hope the car doesn't fall apart.
You know,

2980
02:14:28,730 --> 02:14:29,563
cards fall apart.
So hard to get through a camp without 

2981
02:14:31,411 --> 02:14:32,244
getting injured.
Like we're in danger of losing tj 

2982
02:14:34,621 --> 02:14:38,250
dillashaw versus a cody garbrandt for 
the bantamweight title.

2983
02:14:38,350 --> 02:14:41,400
Cody cody,
cody garbrandt right now is in Germany,

2984
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:42,533
getting some shit done to his back and 
he's getting Regena keen done on his 

2985
02:14:46,771 --> 02:14:49,920
back to deal with a bulging disc that's 
been bothering me.

2986
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:51,833
Like,
um,

2987
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:55,140
I followed him on twitter and then he 
followed me back.

2988
02:14:55,380 --> 02:14:56,280
Oh,
that's cool.

2989
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:58,570
That's dope.
It's just strikingly handsome guys.

2990
02:14:58,590 --> 02:14:59,910
Very handsome.
Beautiful Man.

2991
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:05,760
Bad motherfucker too.
That was the best fight of that night.

2992
02:15:05,790 --> 02:15:07,080
Dominick Cruz,
him and dominick Cruz.

2993
02:15:07,110 --> 02:15:08,070
Yeah.
Well,

2994
02:15:08,071 --> 02:15:08,904
not only that,
but I mean he's fighting a guy who was 

2995
02:15:09,811 --> 02:15:10,644
consensus top two or three pound for 
pound fighter in the world and Dominick 

2996
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:15,090
Cruz and he still lit them up.

2997
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:16,890
Yeah.
That's a big fight.

2998
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:18,970
And,
and the bravado that.

2999
02:15:19,380 --> 02:15:20,340
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3000
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,370
Oh yeah.
I was break dancing and shit improvising

3001
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:25,740
after he dropped him and knocked him 
down.

3002
02:15:25,741 --> 02:15:29,760
He was posing kid finished Mba.
He was telling us about that.

3003
02:15:30,090 --> 02:15:31,410
I don't know about that.
I mean,

3004
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:34,080
if he thought he could have finished and
we would have tried to finish him,

3005
02:15:34,081 --> 02:15:36,450
he realized that dom was hurting Stan,
do you want to humiliate him?

3006
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:38,640
He wanted to fuck with his head because 
dom,

3007
02:15:39,090 --> 02:15:40,530
Dominick Cruz,
his whole game,

3008
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:41,393
a big part of it was getting inside your
head be fucked with the wrong guy 

3009
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:46,630
because cody grew up getting fucked with
so like,

3010
02:15:46,670 --> 02:15:48,300
you start fucking with him.
He's like,

3011
02:15:48,330 --> 02:15:49,410
Oh,
I'm home here.

3012
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:51,180
Like I like fucking with people.
Come on,

3013
02:15:51,181 --> 02:15:52,290
fuck with me.
I'll fuck with you.

3014
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:56,130
Like if you want to be like reasonable 
and respectful,

3015
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:58,140
he'll be respectful,
be respectful.

3016
02:15:58,380 --> 02:16:01,770
But if you want to talk shit to him.
Oh he's a black belt and talking shit.

3017
02:16:02,070 --> 02:16:02,903
So it was like dominick Cruz just kind 
of bit off more than he could chew when 

3018
02:16:04,891 --> 02:16:08,010
it came to the shit talking and really 
fired cody up.

3019
02:16:08,220 --> 02:16:09,053
So when cody dropped him and then 
started posing and then dominic has to 

3020
02:16:11,911 --> 02:16:13,650
kind of get it back and he couldn't get 
it back.

3021
02:16:13,651 --> 02:16:15,540
So we got kind of a little bit out of 
his,

3022
02:16:15,541 --> 02:16:17,280
uh,
his comfort level.

3023
02:16:17,830 --> 02:16:21,010
It's just a fascinating aspect of 
fighting the trash,

3024
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:23,000
talking in the mental warfare.
Yeah.

3025
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:24,990
No,
there's a lot to it.

3026
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:26,400
Don't.
Don't ever do that,

3027
02:16:26,401 --> 02:16:27,234
dude.
Don't ever let anybody talk you into 

3028
02:16:28,051 --> 02:16:29,710
doing that.
I know Knoxville,

3029
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:30,310
he

3030
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:34,300
did that boxing match with butter being 
that was so hard to watch.

3031
02:16:35,270 --> 02:16:36,940
It's terrible.
How bad was he?

3032
02:16:36,941 --> 02:16:41,830
Fucked up after that fight.
I know it's not the words for Knoxville.

3033
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:44,133
What is he doing these days?
Right now he's filming a movie in South 

3034
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:47,913
Africa based on a true story about an 
amusement park in New Jersey called 

3035
02:16:52,031 --> 02:16:56,530
action park,
which was notoriously the most dangerous

3036
02:16:57,090 --> 02:17:00,540
a amusement park like lots of people 
died on their rides.

3037
02:17:01,220 --> 02:17:02,053
Everybody that worked there was 
intoxicated and fucked up other working 

3038
02:17:05,951 --> 02:17:06,784
and they caught it.
Class Action Park and I got on stage 

3039
02:17:10,311 --> 02:17:14,500
making a comedy movie about the guy who 
ran that park and they'd set New Jersey,

3040
02:17:14,501 --> 02:17:16,470
but they're filming it in South Africa 
because there's so many.

3041
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:19,480
A lot of shit in South Africa,
so cheap to film in South Africa,

3042
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:21,430
so they're building a whole fucking 
thing.

3043
02:17:21,490 --> 02:17:23,590
Russell Peters just got back from South 
Africa.

3044
02:17:23,591 --> 02:17:27,550
He was filming a new show for Netflix 
called the Indian detective.

3045
02:17:28,170 --> 02:17:30,460
He's filming in South Africa,
I think for the same reasons.

3046
02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:33,580
They just film a lot of stuff in South 
Africa now because of the so cheap.

3047
02:17:33,581 --> 02:17:37,390
They're really.
I remember being there and um,

3048
02:17:37,400 --> 02:17:39,800
we were,
when we went out there for wildboys is a

3049
02:17:39,801 --> 02:17:40,634
dangerous.
Johannesburg is the car jacking capital 

3050
02:17:45,611 --> 02:17:47,100
of the world.
Oh.

3051
02:17:47,290 --> 02:17:50,410
Which we thought was hilarious.
We're jacking off in cars the whole time

3052
02:17:54,720 --> 02:17:58,570
working capital of the world.
I thought it was jersey.

3053
02:17:59,110 --> 02:18:01,160
Wasn't there like a,
a movie on that,

3054
02:18:01,161 --> 02:18:01,994
like drive.
Was there a movie about car jacking and 

3055
02:18:04,811 --> 02:18:07,540
Camden affiliate?
Camden,

3056
02:18:07,541 --> 02:18:09,170
New Jersey.
But they,

3057
02:18:09,190 --> 02:18:10,023
what did they say?
A Cape Town is a first world city and a 

3058
02:18:13,541 --> 02:18:15,220
third world country,
I think.

3059
02:18:15,540 --> 02:18:18,540
Does that makes sense?
So,

3060
02:18:18,541 --> 02:18:19,374
uh,
in Johannesburg is more Hansberger I 

3061
02:18:21,351 --> 02:18:25,390
think is a little gnarlier that's more 
kind of Lebanon kind of deal.

3062
02:18:25,510 --> 02:18:26,480
Oh yeah.
I mean,

3063
02:18:26,490 --> 02:18:27,323
I don't know.

3064
02:18:27,550 --> 02:18:30,850
That was the impression I got was it was
creepier.

3065
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:33,550
I want to go to Africa,
but I'm scared of malaria.

3066
02:18:35,380 --> 02:18:36,213
So funny.
I used to a dump out my malaria pills 

3067
02:18:38,951 --> 02:18:41,990
and fill up the bottle of Xanax.
What?

3068
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:45,400
You weren't worried about malaria.
Now the quote,

3069
02:18:45,401 --> 02:18:46,234
because the malaria pills give you like 
terrible nightmares are no crazy 

3070
02:18:49,781 --> 02:18:50,614
hallucinations.
Like I didn't like the experience in 

3071
02:18:52,361 --> 02:18:54,430
malaria pills.
Would it do for you?

3072
02:18:54,490 --> 02:18:55,610
Give you nightmares?
Yeah.

3073
02:18:55,650 --> 02:18:58,390
Gave me fucked up nightmares if I,
if I remember right,

3074
02:18:58,420 --> 02:19:00,160
I didn't.
And I was like,

3075
02:19:00,161 --> 02:19:00,994
oh,
well I can bring tons of pills and just 

3076
02:19:02,801 --> 02:19:04,780
put them in the wrong bottle.
Will never get malaria.

3077
02:19:04,781 --> 02:19:06,260
Then what?
I don't know.

3078
02:19:07,350 --> 02:19:08,680
That's another thing,
man,

3079
02:19:08,870 --> 02:19:09,703
that uh,
when I was a kid at the American school 

3080
02:19:11,951 --> 02:19:13,360
in London,
like in eighth grade,

3081
02:19:13,361 --> 02:19:17,410
we went on a field trip to Egypt and um,
they told us,

3082
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:19,840
they said,
don't fucking drink the water.

3083
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:20,950
Don't like,
uh,

3084
02:19:20,980 --> 02:19:21,813
even if the order is soda,
don't let them give you ice cubes to 

3085
02:19:24,281 --> 02:19:26,650
Port [inaudible] the,
you'll get so sick from the water.

3086
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:28,760
And uh,
and we took it seriously.

3087
02:19:28,761 --> 02:19:31,580
But then we were eating out Ted,
this restaurant on,

3088
02:19:31,581 --> 02:19:33,320
uh,
on the River Nile.

3089
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:37,670
Here's this Egyptian dude fucking 
watched and Duncan toothbrush.

3090
02:19:37,671 --> 02:19:40,580
And the river now is sitting there 
brushing his teeth and I was thinking,

3091
02:19:40,581 --> 02:19:43,520
well if the tap water so bad then what's
the river?

3092
02:19:43,521 --> 02:19:44,354
Nile has got to be insane.
But I remember at a and I was 13 and I 

3093
02:19:48,141 --> 02:19:49,330
thought,
well fuck,

3094
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:52,100
if that guy or that guy went to America,
that guy went to England,

3095
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:53,570
the toothbrush,
dude,

3096
02:19:53,670 --> 02:19:56,810
he'd probably get sick drinking the 
water where I live.

3097
02:19:57,450 --> 02:19:58,251
I mean,
I don't know.

3098
02:19:58,251 --> 02:20:01,460
It's like whatever your exposure is it,
this has built up his immune system.

3099
02:20:01,461 --> 02:20:02,294
He can do that.

3100
02:20:02,660 --> 02:20:03,493
And I remember thinking it's probably 
the best thing you could do would be to 

3101
02:20:06,321 --> 02:20:09,980
travel the whole world and drink fucking
tap water like crazy everywhere you go.

3102
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:11,900
That'd be the way to build up your 
immune system.

3103
02:20:11,901 --> 02:20:12,734
And then ultimately that's what we did.
Wildboys we went to fucking every God 

3104
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:19,550
damn continent except Antarctica 
Adjunct.

3105
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:20,513
First thing I did in front of them from 
the airport and check in the hotel room 

3106
02:20:22,461 --> 02:20:25,220
and I would put down my bag and I'd 
fucking brush my teeth.

3107
02:20:25,221 --> 02:20:26,054
You know,
you brush your teeth and he'd been 

3108
02:20:26,610 --> 02:20:28,370
rented out and then you think.
And I,

3109
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:30,640
and I'd put my head and out of the tap 
and it's gulp,

3110
02:20:30,641 --> 02:20:31,171
Gulp,
gulp,

3111
02:20:31,171 --> 02:20:34,600
and drink a ton of tap water.
I did that all over the,

3112
02:20:34,670 --> 02:20:37,850
all over Africa.
Fucking Asia,

3113
02:20:38,030 --> 02:20:40,700
South America everywhere I fucking drank
tap water.

3114
02:20:40,701 --> 02:20:41,534
Let's get some other fucker.
Had a little bit of diarrhea in Kenya 

3115
02:20:46,590 --> 02:20:50,510
but bad on.
I don't think that that was a,

3116
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:52,170
that big of a deal.
And I think that,

3117
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:52,890
that,
um,

3118
02:20:52,890 --> 02:20:54,080
the,
that my theory was,

3119
02:20:54,110 --> 02:20:55,580
was a sound.

3120
02:20:58,370 --> 02:21:02,060
I like how you experiment on yourself.
He brought somebody with you.

3121
02:21:02,061 --> 02:21:02,990
Mike.
Drink the water

3122
02:21:03,400 --> 02:21:04,440
right now,
dude.

3123
02:21:04,450 --> 02:21:05,590
Like that's.
Yeah,

3124
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:06,473
it's wider.
Understand Germaphobes and shit like 

3125
02:21:07,811 --> 02:21:08,680
that.
That's crazy.

3126
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:11,830
You live in an incubator,
that's how you get sick,

3127
02:21:11,831 --> 02:21:13,470
you know,
you want to like,

3128
02:21:13,980 --> 02:21:17,170
I don't get nervous about shaking 
people's hands or no shit like that.

3129
02:21:17,171 --> 02:21:18,850
Fuck that.
That's keeping your immune system on it.

3130
02:21:19,580 --> 02:21:20,413
Yeah.
No,

3131
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:23,990
of course of a weekend I'll shake 
hundreds of people's hands.

3132
02:21:23,991 --> 02:21:24,640
Sure.
You know,

3133
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:25,473
at a comedy show,
especially if I have a meet and greet 

3134
02:21:26,751 --> 02:21:27,584
after the show,
which I didn't do in Dallas this past 

3135
02:21:30,470 --> 02:21:31,303
weekend.
But for people that are asking fucking 

3136
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:35,840
unbelievable,
6,000 people,

3137
02:21:35,841 --> 02:21:37,880
I can do it.
Congratulations.

3138
02:21:37,881 --> 02:21:39,350
Thanks man.
That was fucking cool.

3139
02:21:39,560 --> 02:21:40,400
Thank you.
It's fun.

3140
02:21:40,401 --> 02:21:42,890
It's fucking awesome.
I just saw it.

3141
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:44,960
I saw this morning.
I know you're a tour guide.

3142
02:21:44,961 --> 02:21:47,360
I'm jealous of your tour.
Scheduled to go like three days and then

3143
02:21:47,361 --> 02:21:48,710
I'm home for.
That's how I do it.

3144
02:21:48,711 --> 02:21:50,060
I can't do any.
I have kids.

3145
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:52,500
I don't want to do it any other way.
I do two days.

3146
02:21:52,710 --> 02:21:56,030
Come back.
Bert Kreischer schedule.

3147
02:21:56,120 --> 02:21:56,841
Oh,
he's crazy.

3148
02:21:56,841 --> 02:22:00,320
He's fucking hilarious.
So Bert Kreischer would go and do things

3149
02:22:00,321 --> 02:22:05,321
on the road for months at a time in a 
television show the entire fucking year.

3150
02:22:05,930 --> 02:22:06,763
You guys never have.
Well for his television show was real 

3151
02:22:08,871 --> 02:22:09,301
bad,
but.

3152
02:22:09,301 --> 02:22:11,030
And he's not doing that television show 
anymore,

3153
02:22:11,031 --> 02:22:13,820
which I think is great because it allows
them to concentrate on a standup,

3154
02:22:13,821 --> 02:22:14,654
which is another thing.
It's like that was kind of his honeypot 

3155
02:22:17,180 --> 02:22:20,910
was the his travel channel show.
Whereas it was kind of taken away from a

3156
02:22:20,911 --> 02:22:21,744
standup,
but now a standard was blowing up 

3157
02:22:22,791 --> 02:22:26,160
because he's really focusing on.
And he's doing it a touring a lot

3158
02:22:26,370 --> 02:22:27,780
and now people are getting a chance to 
enter.

3159
02:22:27,930 --> 02:22:30,150
It's tighter too,
like you see him on stage,

3160
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:32,880
it's fucking super tight because he's 
performing a lot,

3161
02:22:33,190 --> 02:22:34,023
would go a long time without performing 
because he'd be doing all this crazy 

3162
02:22:38,101 --> 02:22:39,780
shit on the road.
Right.

3163
02:22:39,790 --> 02:22:40,860
So she enjoyed,
you know,

3164
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:42,970
it's so fun.
I love them too.

3165
02:22:42,971 --> 02:22:43,804
Like I did his podcast and we had,
we had a blast and he really encouraged 

3166
02:22:47,141 --> 02:22:49,650
me is like a man,
go to the store,

3167
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:50,513
go to the store.
And I've been going to the store a lot 

3168
02:22:51,810 --> 02:22:52,351
and,
and,

3169
02:22:52,351 --> 02:22:54,640
and he,
he encouraged me to do that.

3170
02:22:54,670 --> 02:22:55,503
That's awesome.
I just think it's funny how you say 

3171
02:22:56,801 --> 02:22:57,634
that,
uh,

3172
02:22:57,700 --> 02:23:00,070
his standup separate because of the 
travel channel show,

3173
02:23:00,071 --> 02:23:03,880
but now he's on the road and like 
everyday out of the year it's like where

3174
02:23:03,881 --> 02:23:05,020
does his family fit in?

3175
02:23:05,720 --> 02:23:08,180
He's not really mean.
He's home during the weekdays a lot.

3176
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:09,730
It's weekends.
Why?

3177
02:23:09,740 --> 02:23:11,370
Yeah.
But he's on the comedy club grind.

3178
02:23:11,371 --> 02:23:14,120
So that means he doesn't night.
That's the way it works with me.

3179
02:23:14,121 --> 02:23:14,954
My kids are asleep by the time I leave 
the house because my sets at the comedy 

3180
02:23:17,391 --> 02:23:18,770
store always like 10,
15.

3181
02:23:19,010 --> 02:23:19,843
I put my kids to bed at eight and then 
I'll go over my material real quick and 

3182
02:23:22,551 --> 02:23:24,560
head out the door and then,
you know,

3183
02:23:24,561 --> 02:23:26,050
it's like I have another life,
you know,

3184
02:23:26,110 --> 02:23:28,010
have the nighttime life.
It's,

3185
02:23:28,070 --> 02:23:29,750
it's doable.
It's doable,

3186
02:23:29,751 --> 02:23:32,300
but the travels of fucking grind,
man,

3187
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:33,820
it's just,
it's so bad

3188
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:35,930
for your body.
I'm not touring as much as I,

3189
02:23:35,931 --> 02:23:39,320
as I did the last few week on week off.

3190
02:23:39,910 --> 02:23:41,170
Yeah.
I think on week off,

3191
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:45,340
week on week off as a way to do it.
Two weekends out of the month is enough.

3192
02:23:45,370 --> 02:23:47,710
It's more than enough because like if I 
come home,

3193
02:23:47,740 --> 02:23:48,573
like yesterday I was wrecked when I come
home just just for the weekend of 

3194
02:23:52,031 --> 02:23:55,360
traveling and then the flight Ensonata 
fucking long flight.

3195
02:23:55,361 --> 02:23:57,460
Dallas is only two and a half hours or 
something.

3196
02:23:57,880 --> 02:23:59,740
It's nothing but you get home and you're
like,

3197
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:02,140
oh,
you just said so dragon.

3198
02:24:02,410 --> 02:24:04,330
But what you gotta do is work out.
That's the key.

3199
02:24:04,900 --> 02:24:06,130
When you get home from something like 
that,

3200
02:24:06,131 --> 02:24:06,964
go on a hike,
do something to get your metabolism 

3201
02:24:09,191 --> 02:24:11,110
pumped up,
and then you'll feel normal.

3202
02:24:11,850 --> 02:24:14,170
It's the only way to feel normal.
If you feel jet lagged.

3203
02:24:14,171 --> 02:24:16,030
A lot of people just like to lay around,
do nothing.

3204
02:24:16,690 --> 02:24:17,523
You can't do that.
You've gotta you gotta kickstart your 

3205
02:24:18,971 --> 02:24:20,110
body.
Just got a blog.

3206
02:24:20,140 --> 02:24:24,400
All the carbon can meditate too.
That'll help too.

3207
02:24:24,820 --> 02:24:25,653
That'll help too.
Don't worry about people fucking with 

3208
02:24:27,911 --> 02:24:28,650
you,
Steven.

3209
02:24:28,650 --> 02:24:29,483
I nowadays,

3210
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:31,090
thanks for setting me straight like 
that.

3211
02:24:31,330 --> 02:24:32,101
No problem,
man.

3212
02:24:32,101 --> 02:24:32,934
I felt I got to have pharmacy staff said
what if had talked about hookers so 

3213
02:24:35,891 --> 02:24:38,850
much.
He didn't.

3214
02:24:38,930 --> 02:24:41,980
I know or whatever.
That's the hooker stories are so fucking

3215
02:24:41,990 --> 02:24:42,823
ancient care.
It's just that I have a girlfriend now 

3216
02:24:44,231 --> 02:24:46,180
and I'm really.
She's just wonderful,

3217
02:24:46,181 --> 02:24:49,570
wonderful person and I'd hate for her to
feel bad.

3218
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:51,220
I'd hate for her tabby.
Negative.

3219
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:53,260
Negatively impact.
I'm not saying anything.

3220
02:24:53,261 --> 02:24:54,420
Who Cares?
I'll go ahead and tell her,

3221
02:24:54,421 --> 02:24:56,510
hey,
I taught some old hooker stories now.

3222
02:24:56,590 --> 02:24:57,423
Like,
who cares?

3223
02:24:57,570 --> 02:24:59,050
You're just sensitive.
But then,

3224
02:24:59,051 --> 02:24:59,884
um,
yeah,

3225
02:24:59,910 --> 02:25:01,840
one reason why you like to snuggle.
You're a good guy.

at cobb's in San Francisco.

3246
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:44,780
If anybody's listening and they're like,

3253
02:25:58,470 --> 02:26:01,720
My next Gig is in Salt Lake City 
wiseguys.

3254
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:02,591
Oh,

3255
02:26:02,591 --> 02:26:03,424
Cool.
I wonder if you had tickets can be my 

3256
02:26:03,881 --> 02:26:05,800
sixth time there.
I'd love it if,

3257
02:26:05,801 --> 02:26:08,140

If I'm in the one of the Green Valley.

3258
02:26:08,141 --> 02:26:10,740
Is it called her?
I don't know which one I'm going to.

3259
02:26:10,760 --> 02:26:13,120
I don't know which one.
Which in July.

3260
02:26:13,420 --> 02:26:14,830
Salt Lake City.
I love that.

3261
02:26:14,831 --> 02:26:17,440
Fucking Salt Lake City is a great 
fucking place.

3262
02:26:17,441 --> 02:26:19,210
People have it all goofy.

3263
02:26:21,670 --> 02:26:23,140
Well,
they have it.

3264
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:27,220
They have it in their head that Salt 
Lake City is like stuck a mormons,

3265
02:26:27,400 --> 02:26:28,860
but the people that come out to the 
comedy clubs,

3266
02:26:28,910 --> 02:26:30,250
the people that are tired of the 
Mormons.

3267
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:32,620
Sure they're fun.
Or the people that are Mormons.

3268
02:26:32,621 --> 02:26:33,920
That could take a joke.
I've done so.

3269
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:36,190
I've done so phenomenally well there.
I mean,

3270
02:26:36,590 --> 02:26:37,423
I really think I'd been there five times
and I think I'm going back for my sixth 

3271
02:26:40,181 --> 02:26:41,014
time.
Joey ideas was the first person to tell 

3272
02:26:42,101 --> 02:26:42,510
me.
He's like,

3273
02:26:42,510 --> 02:26:44,920
Joe Rogan,
you've got to get done that fucking Salt

3274
02:26:44,920 --> 02:26:46,900
Lake City.
Those motherfuckers are starving.

3275
02:26:47,050 --> 02:26:49,390
They're starving for comedy.
I love it.

3276
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:50,950
I love it.
And what?

3277
02:26:50,951 --> 02:26:52,930
What the fuck outside after that,
I'm not even.

3278
02:26:53,860 --> 02:26:55,740
I can.
Everything's that.

I'm filming a cameo for this.

3281
02:27:00,521 --> 02:27:04,030
A movie on Netflix called game over man.
What is it?

3282
02:27:04,390 --> 02:27:04,850
Oh No,

3283
02:27:04,850 --> 02:27:07,340
but I think seth rogen producing it.
Cool.

3284
02:27:07,400 --> 02:27:08,233
It's Netflix original.
Isn't it interesting that Netflix is 

3285
02:27:09,971 --> 02:27:10,804
doing all these original movies now too?
Like he keeps seeing what the fuck are 

3286
02:27:13,931 --> 02:27:14,764
they coming up?
I was talking to her about how they're 

3287
02:27:16,661 --> 02:27:20,530
giving away so much millions of a 
dollars to comedians for.

3288
02:27:20,900 --> 02:27:22,100
It's great.
It was.

3289
02:27:22,101 --> 02:27:23,250
It was.
It was cracking up.

3290
02:27:23,251 --> 02:27:24,940
He was like,
what am I good time to get into comedy.

3291
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:28,140
It's very good.
Yeah.

3292
02:27:28,330 --> 02:27:29,450
All right.
