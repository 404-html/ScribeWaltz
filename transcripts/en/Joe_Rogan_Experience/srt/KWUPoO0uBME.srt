1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:02,883
Right back.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,440
We're back. Perfect. Amy on point.
Right? That time when the round starts,

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,800
I like how they're doing that. Well, they
have like a, a seven eighths commercial.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,630
Pretty Rhonda rousing.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,390
All right. Second round. Very interesting.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,800
Who's better than herb dean as a referee?
I say no one and it's good. I see.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,700
I think he's the best big. John
McCarthy gets a little bossy.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,890
I've seen that happen a few times.
The hardest I got to bring this up.

9
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:37,540
The hardest one I ever saw was a,
uh, I wanna say Frodo versus Marlin.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,080
Sandro. Uh, there was a nut shot
and John says, I don't think no.

11
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:46,840
Was that bad. You have two minutes. Yeah.
When I'm there going, you can't do that.

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,060
It makes sense as the commentary.

13
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:53,650
I have to explain that the referee just
said something that doesn't make sense.

14
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:58,420
Doesn't make any sense. Thank
[inaudible]. Can't do that Jeremy.

15
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:01,870
Just tag cub with a nice right hand.
So that's the knock on, on big John.

16
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,100
How bout this? This Strauss fight.
When James Strauss fought Bobby,

17
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,710
Bobby Green and Bobby Green
kicked him in the nuts two times.

18
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:11,320
Had Him hurt bad then kicked him
in the nuts a third time so hard.

19
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,890
You can hear the cup or the palm heard
the pop of the cup and big John said it

20
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:18,010
was a gut shot and stopped
the fight and you know,

21
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,720
I think knew that he fucked up
but just didn't want to admit it.

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,440
That was a mistake. That
was just a mistake. I mean
everybody makes mistakes. Yeah.

23
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,360
Especially when you're in something
like you're refereeing in MMA.

24
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,860
I mean he's still one of my all time
favorites and he did a great fucking job.

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,060
Popped him again. He's a monster
man. He's just hit so hard.

26
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:40,060
He smiled at them and they
touch gloves afterwards.

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,820
Yeah. Jeremy's power. That
fucking power or something, man.

28
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,500
Okay.

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,640
Oh, when he goes to the body there,
the problem is if your cub Swanson,

30
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:54,560
you'd have to stay busy cause
you gotta outland the guy,

31
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,570
you can't go one for
one with Jeremy Stevens.

32
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:59,240
Well he's doing a lot of thinking
and he's thinking a lot. Yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,530
He's got to do a lot of thinking.

34
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,390
You've got this fucking
monster in front of you.

35
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,230
So that's the problem is you have to
stay busy to Atlanta, but you don't,

36
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,070
you can't leave a vulnerability for go.
It's that hard. You just can't. Yeah.

37
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:14,000
And he's quick. Yeah. Jeremy's not slow
and he's, he was not counter fighter too.

38
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,650
He's not just an aggressive guy.
He's good at setting shit up.

39
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,960
That was a nice inside leg kick.

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,290
He's really come a long way since
he went to alliance to Eric Delphia.

41
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,660
I was doing a great job with him.

42
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,020
Okay.

43
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,140
It's just, it's so fucking
huge to have good coaching.

44
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,440
You've been with Oyama
your entire career now.

45
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:36,310
I started with Chris Brennan and
then I left Christmas to go to Jeremy

46
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,820
Generation. Tim Ngi, next generation.
Back in the day of those guys.

47
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,500
I was a fucking kid, you know, I
just [inaudible] he's right now.

48
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,740
He's in trouble. Damn. That
was a hard fucking punch.

49
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,740
Oh Shit. Holy Shit. She's not smiling at
this one now. Then he smiles. Yeah, Dude.

50
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,540
Jeremy Stevens can fucking bang.
Wow.

51
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,750
Okay.

52
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,210
COMP is a, it's gotta be very careful.
He looks all tentative now too, right?

53
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,530
He, I would, I would be, yeah, he's
got fucking cracked a couple of times,

54
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,810
especially Jeremy at one 45
carrying all that power down

55
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,140
is in a weird thing. Power. It's like you
can't really eat, can only teach so much.

56
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,880
You can teach a guy to hit harder,

57
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,240
but you can never teach a guy
to be like a Tommy Hearns.

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,850
You either have that
shit or you don't see,

59
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:31,990
my brother got the power in the family.
He hits a fucking truck, but I just,

60
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,153
I don't know.

61
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,380
I didn't get it. It's
weird isn't it? You just,

62
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:38,810
either you get it or you
don't like a joke. Oh,

63
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:41,810
we tried that cartwheel kick again.
Like a guy like George Foreman,

64
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,670
you can never teach. I got a
punch like that. They just, they,

65
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:46,960
you could either do it or you don't.

66
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,670
So strange because you can get
a guy stronger. You can lift

67
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,010
weights and you can be physically strong.
You can take it to it. Like you said,

68
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:57,830
you can take it to a certain degree in
teach you gotta really turn over a punch,

69
00:03:57,831 --> 00:04:00,020
stuff like that, but right. Yeah.

70
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,910
But you can never develop a
Pino Quavis left hook. No. Uh,

71
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,790
you have that Hook because you have that
power. It carries through technique.

72
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,140
And what's your technique?
It's better.

73
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:12,320
You just punched fucking harder and
better. Yeah. You just get better.

74
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,330
But there's certain guys like they
have that rocky Marciano thing. Yeah.

75
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,220
That Marsianno Jersey Joe
Walcott and knock out,

76
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,650
there's like a classic
photo up against the rope.

77
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:25,500
His arm's hanging there and he sees
conveyancing Walcott's face and walkouts

78
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,600
faces all distorted like
Marsianno had that creepy power,

79
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,230
that weird thing. They were guys can just,
just fuck your world up with one shot

80
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,540
and you either have that or you
don't. It's weird, you know,

81
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,320
great fighters who go their entire
career without that one weapon.

82
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,950
You know, Jeremy, Steve and shoots
her, it gets a take down too.

83
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,790
That was one of the things that core mia
was talking about in the breakdown was

84
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,540
a Steven should threaten with
a take down or to just to, uh,

85
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,520
just to keep cub Swanson thinking
it's freezes people up a lot, man.

86
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,500
Yeah.
And he's right in front of his corner too.

87
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,770
There's the active yarrow right
in front of the alliance team.

88
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,420
Great fucking team in San Diego. It's
a good round for Steven's. Huge round

89
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,480
cubs wants, got a bunch of roses on
his leg. It's an interesting choice.

90
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,980
Ooh. Now they're good, right? Yeah.

91
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,060
I would like to hear what a
cubs corners telling him, man.

92
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,650
I would love to hear
what they have to say.

93
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,140
Wonder what kind of
advice they're giving him.

94
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,360
You know what a what an accident
is Jackson using? Is He?

95
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,150
That was hilarious. That Russian accent.
I think they have a game that they play.

96
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,180
Oh my God likes it when he talks to
him like that. Thinks it's funny.

97
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,040
At least that's what he said.

98
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,680
He's doing his best
fucking lock impression.

99
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,250
That was a big fucking wind for Henderson.
Beaten Hobby Loft. Yeah. Finishing him.

100
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,280
Yeah. Finishing it with
a rear naked. Yeah,

101
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,570
just lower down. When we don't
deliver that lower Napo come on back.

102
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,423
Come back to the fucking

103
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,920
lower down and come back with something.
Look at this

104
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,110
Jeremy Stevens, a mother fucker, and
that's that right hand over the top.

105
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:17,040
They're really clipped him
two big rounds for Jeremy Stevens,

106
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:17,874
right?
Yeah.

107
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,920
Okay.

108
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,470
Jimmy looks fucking good man.
Yeah, it's gotta be the beard.

109
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,830
It's a little bit of everything,
man. He's just, he's amped up man.

110
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:30,390
The kids motivated round three should
see when he wakes up in the morning with

111
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,224
his kids,

112
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,150
fire it up five or six in the morning.
But it's shame.

113
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:38,130
That was all you used to go down there
and just what he does and oh yeah.

114
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,720
If it gets up at like six and they
see him as kids are fucking chant and

115
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:43,700
marching around the house
cooking breakfast. They
say fire it up, fire it up.

116
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:47,940
Really? And Shane didn't wake up
early, so that's what he does.

117
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,830
So he's got like a champ that he
does in the morning. Wow. Oh it did.

118
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,200
Just to get his kids up out
of bed. Oh, that's hilarious.

119
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,200
My mom used to sing and I was
like, mom, get out of my room.

120
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,140
You are an early morning person.
Stop it.

121
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,980
I don't believe there are early,
early morning people.

122
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:06,950
There's people that just wake up earlier
than you and they want you to think

123
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:09,890
they are early morning people so
they have some sort of edge on you.

124
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,600
No.
If you have no reason to get,

125
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:15,730
if it's Sunday and you're up at five in
the morning like my mom are and you love

126
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:17,250
that Shit,
you are an early morning person.

127
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:21,920
She will get up at five five
30 on a Sunday for no reason.
That's ridiculous. Hey,

128
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,520
that's ridiculous. My daughter woke me
up at like six dad will sleep till noon.

129
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:27,890
I don't know how they
ever spoke to one of you.

130
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,290
My kids will climb on top of
me at five in the morning.

131
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,990
Started asking me questions. Yeah, and
I'm like, go away. They're so cute though.

132
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,040
Go hang out with GRANDPA. My four year
old, she would just touch my face. Daddy,

133
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,030
give me kiss. Oh, you're cute. And
so sweet. Can we go in the pool?

134
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,280
Five of the vulgar morning. You want to
swim? Nice, right hand. The right hand.

135
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,830
I knew better than trying to wake
my dad up at six in the morning.

136
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,430
I got thrown through a window.
I got to seriously,

137
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,080
my dad did not play one daughter
who is a fucking princesses.

138
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,440
Me and my dad living in the house.

139
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:04,790
So she's just got us fucking
wrapped around her finger. She just,

140
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,640
I'm like, oh go get a, she awakes
two and a half should wake up,

141
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:09,020
take her diaper off coal.

142
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,640
Come try and wake me up and a up
with a nice right hand there man. Oh

143
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,760
he is hurt another right hand. Yep. Oh

144
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,690
now can you, oh Jeremy Ryan. He's stunned.

145
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,840
He is and he's still trying to protect
that body yet. It's still hurting.

146
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,780
He can't bring his right hand up cause
he's keeping the oval down there.

147
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:34,590
He's reacting from the body and
cubs season goes from the left hook.

148
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,750
He went with the left hook upstairs.

149
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,070
Okay.

150
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,340
And he brought it from down low cut.
Oh right hand.

151
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,760
Oh beautiful.
That's the accuracy of cub.

152
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,090
He's got such good accuracy and that's
something you saw on the Seaver fight.

153
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,960
Oh good takedown defense to Jeremy's a
little bit of trouble seeing breed there.

154
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:56,070
Just trying to breathe to get those the
flow back to his lungs because he is

155
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,500
a body shots taken everything out of him.

156
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,730
Okay.

157
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,220
Yeah.
That body shot really fucked him up man.

158
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:06,660
That kick and cubs switching that
stance against to looking forward again,

159
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:08,970
looking for that left
kick cub needs a recharge.

160
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:10,670
There were no obvious with that left here.

161
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,280
Throw that thing just hit the body cause
whether they can block it because even

162
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,290
if you block it you're hurting.
Yeah.

163
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,950
Well I think he was throwing it up high
just because he figured he was going to

164
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,900
protect his ribs at all costs. Jeremy's
still hurting, man. He's still hurting.

165
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,220
You see the power difference.

166
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:32,170
Cub landed some great shots in sequence
in Gi clinic. Get Steven's office feet.

167
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,250
Yeah
man.

168
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,070
Interesting fight. Very interesting. Very,

169
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:44,150
very interesting and interesting to see
what kind of damage Jeremy is sustained

170
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,350
from that kick to the body.

171
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,520
You know a lot of guys get broken
ribs from that kick to the body a lot.

172
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,040
Do you remember that Heath
Herring Cro cop picture? Yup.

173
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,010
There was a picture of a cro cop where
he threw a left body kick and it's

174
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:00,830
halfway into heath herrings,
abdomen.

175
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,130
It literally looks like he got thrown from
a car wrapped around a telephone pole.

176
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,450
Like, Whoa, who is it?
Who did he leave the, the,

177
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,220
the toe of the foot bruise on Vandelay
Silva man. That was the first fight.

178
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,410
Famous footprint.
Yeah.

179
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:20,000
That was back when Vandelay and him had
that weird rules where they only find

180
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:23,780
the ground for 30 seconds.
They just wanted to stand in
bludgeon each other. Well,

181
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:26,730
there was a, it was first time
that cro cop had fought MMA. Yeah.

182
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,790
Weird hybrid match. He wanted some weird
rules and if it, if nothing happened,

183
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,040
if nobody finished anybody
who was a draw. Yeah. Yeah.

184
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,040
So that's how that fight turned out
a draw. And then in the rematch,

185
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,190
he just beat the career out of it
and the rematch, it was full cro cop.

186
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,920
There's the, there's the uh, photo
right there. There's the picture.

187
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,880
Look at that picture.
Oh my God. Oh my God.

188
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:51,881
The photo of Marco's fucking Chin
halfway into heath herrings body is so

189
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,260
terrifying. It's wrapping around.
That's a perfect kick. I, so can you,

190
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,360
can you kick any better than that?
That's about it. It's perfect.

191
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,980
And here Jeremy and cub going
at it in the third round.

192
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,830
Jeremy cannot wait for
this round to be over.

193
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,490
This is amazing fight so far
though. Yeah, it is. Well,

194
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:15,870
good knee to the body by cub.

195
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,613
Okay.

196
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,730
Do you think everyone always says hey.
Oh Hey, there's that Mexican actor. Ooh,

197
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,710
Mexican actor.

198
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,890
Oh, that guy. I didn't see that
movie, but I know who that guy is.

199
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:39,780
I've seen him in other shit.
Let me hear what they're saying.

200
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,490
Give us some volume,
Jamie

201
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,130
to work. They're like, attacks are good.
I need combinations. Two to three punches.

202
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,530
There's talking about combination.
I want to know about his Bonnie

203
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,520
deep breath here. It is slanted. Yeah.

204
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,080
Right to the liver man

205
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,510
that look on your face when you know
it's coming and he can't stop it.

206
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,830
Is that right hand over the top?
Look how accurate cub is. Yup.

207
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,920
He's so fucking accurate
in these wild malaise.

208
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,933
Okay.

209
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,720
It was one of the most impressive
things I've ever seen as far as like

210
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:33,000
combinations of techniques landed was
his fight with Seaver. Yeah, it was.

211
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,900
Yeah cause it was, everything was bunched
up in one certain fucking box. Yeah.

212
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,680
And he was, there were, you know,

213
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:42,250
Siva was moving away and he was chasing
after him was still catching with

214
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:46,900
everything. Here's a good kick by cub cubs
coming on strong and that third round.

215
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:50,200
This is a very interesting fight.
Now round two definitely.

216
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,030
You got to give to Jeremy Stevens.

217
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:56,620
Round three definitely got to give to cub
the first round. I think Steven's one.

218
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,580
But you put your, you're heading
into subjective in competence area.

219
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,910
You know when a fight is close it's
like you would like experts to call it,

220
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,160
but they're not. That's the weirdest
thing about MMA judging. It's,

221
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,670
they're not experts at all. Some lady that
got the job because she knew somebody.

222
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:21,580
Then the question,
I mean for,

223
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:24,050
for people who don't know anything
about MMA that are listening to this,

224
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,340
you would think they were exaggerating,
but we're, we're not exaggerating.

225
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:33,430
MMA judging is the worst out of any sport
in the world that you could think of

226
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,700
where you have like experts that are
watching the contest at the highest level

227
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,050
and they're, they're aware of the subtle
nuances of ebb and flow. The fight world.

228
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,540
Well, that must be the
case in MMA, surely,

229
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,580
where there's billions
of dollars on the line.

230
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Multinational corporations owned by Viacom
and people called zoo fa and by they

231
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:59,960
would ensure that these
headings or someone else's
life judged correctly. Cool.

232
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:03,230
Courier. No, they're
just fucking terribly,

233
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:08,231
they're the worst judged contests probably
in all of professional sports is MMA.

234
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,200
There's more in competence in a MMA
judging and more judging being done by

235
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:18,170
people who have no idea what
they're watching. Just guesswork.

236
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,450
We'll have no background in the sport, no
background, not even as an amateur, not,

237
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:24,860
not as an amateur competitor,

238
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,170
not even as a person who practices
it and not even a martial artist.

239
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,470
No martial arts background at all.

240
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,073
Okay.

241
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,020
A lot of the delays,

242
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:37,720
sometimes we'll get on when there's a bad
decision and there's, there's a delay.

243
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:40,840
A lot of times our ring announcer,
Michael C.

244
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,800
Williams is going around making sure
that they knew it was the right person.

245
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,220
Like you know they're the one with the
gray shorts and then the want the red

246
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:52,610
shorts. Right. We had one where they had
mixed it up, dad gone the wrong person.

247
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:56,330
He had to go around and go, uh, you know
they have the retro, it's like Oh hold on.

248
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:58,610
And they scratched it and put different,
different numbers in there.

249
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,260
It has happened man

250
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,540
and competence.

251
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,870
It's just the sport was kind of like
nudged in and one of the Wa the big pieces

252
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:11,560
of evidence that it was nudged in is the
adoption of the 10 point must system.

253
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,820
It's just not a good system. It was
too much going on in MMA and boxing.

254
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:17,950
That system makes sense
cause you're only boxing.

255
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,930
But when you have boxing
with knees, elbows, kicks,

256
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,860
and then take downs and then
submissions and then ground impound,

257
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,570
all those variables that don't exist in,

258
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,290
in a boxing scoring system, it's just
the 10 points. It's just not enough.

259
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,810
What does it do? Like a 30 point
system. That's a good idea.

260
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,700
Groundwork takedowns and then strike it.
And it's still all subjective though.

261
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:45,550
You'd have to know what the fuck is
going on. Like you'd have to know,

262
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,950
like sometimes the guys caught in
a, in a guy's, uh, like a guy got,

263
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,830
has a guy's nice and a lot of trouble
and sometimes the guys not in trouble at

264
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:54,310
all.

265
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,520
And you have to be able to differentiate
between a guy who's defending really

266
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,770
well and a guy who's not
defending well at all.

267
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:04,150
It was on the brink of getting finished
at any second. There's a difference.

268
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,550
Well, cubs smiling because he defended
a takedown. Good. He punched the body.

269
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,510
They're in short range.
He's taking that right hand at the body.

270
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,130
How, how hard are those knees
to the thigh on the Europe,

271
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,050
the hero of the cage like that? How much
of those suck? I don't, I don't know.

272
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,910
Do you know, feel him at the time? No. I
mean, you're so amped up with adrenaline.

273
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,240
Yeah. And you just kind of get
past the pain thing. That's just,

274
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,640
that's going to go away. Or when
you're in training, do you wear,

275
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,760
do you wear knee pads when
you're in training, when you
do those? Sometimes, yeah.

276
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:42,000
I won't need without any pads on.
I mean that's just not really fair.

277
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,330
They can fuck each other up is
rude. Yeah, exactly. It's just some,

278
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,320
some rude shit to do to each other.
It's like foot stomps and training.

279
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:53,130
You have to be an asshole. It's fucking
stupid. Front knee kicks. Oh yeah.

280
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:55,350
Those are brutal.
Those little bleak kicks in front,

281
00:16:55,351 --> 00:17:00,160
like so kicks at Jon Jones does to the
PSI effective, but they're an old cub.

282
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,110
Just Nice. He's blitzkrieg ing. Jeremy's
starting to slow down a little bit.

283
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,720
I noticed a number of training where
I got kicked a need around the muscle.

284
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:09,430
When they find that space
in between the muscles.

285
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,340
Ooh. Oh Man. It was always
terrible the next day.

286
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,050
That's the accuracy of real Thai baht.

287
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,960
Real Thai guys at one spot and
the kick it twice and you're like,

288
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:19,510
fuck 'em I'm sucks over this.
Vanessa,

289
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:24,430
who's used to always get that spot right
above the knee where the bone meets the

290
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:27,280
top of the quad or the
bottom on the quad stopped.

291
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:30,760
He googled Changin with kicks and K one.
Yeah,

292
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,930
there's a few of those guys that tried
to venture forth in the k one from MMA

293
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,670
work. Tourists results,
oftentimes disastrous results.

294
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,980
But rampage did that.
A lot of people forget.

295
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:46,750
Rampage fought Mike Bernardo and beat
them and beat them in fucking k one

296
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,080
rampage was a beast in his prime.
I mean, it's Kinda sucks now here,

297
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:54,960
and I'm talking about retirement and
Hayden and yeah, he's still fighting,

298
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:58,530
but you could tell he's kind of on his
way out doing it for the money. Yeah.

299
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,860
Job Security. Yeah. Well it's a lot of
money. Me, he's got a bunch of kids too.

300
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:08,490
There's a lot going on.
You got to keep that money coming in.

301
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,530
It's, but it's, it's one of those guys,

302
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,690
he was the first guy ever rolled
with ever wrap on a mat was rampage.

303
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,610
I'm actually, that was fun. Yeah.
Um, he brings it up a lot when,

304
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,540
when we're hanging out and every time I
see him and, uh, uh, nice. Look at that.

305
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:31,430
Nice. Neat. Naturally when
the most incredibly strong
people. Yeah. He's so strong.

306
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:32,690
My God.
Yeah.

307
00:18:32,691 --> 00:18:36,500
I rolled with him before when
we were filming that a UFC,

308
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,370
whatever the fuck it was show for
spike. Yeah. So strong. It's ridiculous.

309
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,773
Here we go.

310
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,390
Yeah.

311
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,780
Final round here. Hey, that last
round one to, it's a good question.

312
00:18:46,781 --> 00:18:48,970
That's a close one.
It was close.

313
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,580
Okay.

314
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,240
I wasn't really paying attention enough
to score it. You know, I don't like,

315
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,110
I mean sometimes a rounds obvious,
but even when I'm doing commentary,

316
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,510
I don't know because what
I'm doing commentary,

317
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:03,580
I'm trying to point out all
these different things about,

318
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,750
around and I'm not doing it.
I think if you're going to score around,

319
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:10,540
you should shut the fuck up and you should
have a piece of paper in front of you

320
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,640
and you should be marking things down.
You know,

321
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:15,490
Eddie Bravo used to do
it in between fights. Um,

322
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,820
in between rounds he would talk
about the round and you know,

323
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,640
I'd have like an official scorekeeper,
like a,

324
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:25,030
they have Harold Harold betterment for
the u s or for a boxing and Eddie used to

325
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,110
have two columns,

326
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,040
one for each guy and he would have all
these marks down as far as like hard

327
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,790
kicks that were landed punches that were
landed near submissions and he had a

328
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,550
whole system that he would do and
it was a very accurate system.

329
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,800
I agreed with every one of his little,

330
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:43,210
a little in fight inbetween round things,
creativity,

331
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:47,470
being smart and being knowledgeable
of what the fuck's going on. Control.

332
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,830
There's a lot of variables.
I just think that there,

333
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,100
there's too many variables
for a 10 point must system.

334
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,890
We need our own system and I don't,
I don't know what the hell is going to be.

335
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,910
I would like them to Kipp come up with
better fucking gloves and I would like

336
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:04,450
them to come up with a better
scoring system. Those are
my two number one gripes.

337
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,830
I have to score mine for belts or,
and I have some,

338
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:10,250
some fighters to get pissed
at me, man. Yeah. Sorry Dude.

339
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:13,760
Why did they make you it is dead. It's
always a good idea. And I was like,

340
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:16,700
all right, I don't mind doing it. You
know, you should probably tell them, well,

341
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:17,960
I don't know,
do whatever the fuck you want.

342
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:21,140
But I would probably tell them
I don't want to do that anymore.

343
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,100
I don't mind doing it. Just, you know,
just who I think won and why and you know,

344
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,170
it's just a good template for
right. Here's why. I think in,

345
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:29,570
in explaining the scorecard,

346
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:33,020
it does make me break it down what I'm
thinking while I'm watching it. Right.

347
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:36,110
So I do like it. Do you write
things down when you're scoring?

348
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,570
Like when you were doing commentary,
do you write anything down? Yeah. Yeah.

349
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,650
Sometimes I do. Most of the time
I do. Yeah. I, I just try to,

350
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:47,200
when I'm doing commentary, since I don't
have to score, I just try to be, oh

351
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,960
damn. He's hitting them
hard with that left. Oh,

352
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,140
another right hand is on
a man. Oh, cartwheel kick.

353
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,240
Beautiful Double Jab. Look at
them. Hands Down right hand. Oh,

354
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:05,420
he's taken over.
Jeremy's a bloody mess too.

355
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,110
He's so creative. Like look what he
just did there. He ducks down wings,

356
00:21:12,111 --> 00:21:13,670
that overhead.
Old Left Hook.

357
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,720
So every time he's so accurate man.

358
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,810
And Punch in with your head off of the,

359
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,160
you know the beeline punch in the same
area and still have you and have your

360
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:28,280
head off of, you know, whatever line
you're going on. The other lead. Right?

361
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,510
Two minutes ago though. Good combinations.
This, this round is still kicking.

362
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,280
Jeremy's got a lot of blood coming out
of that nose. Oh, splattering everywhere.

363
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,950
Yeah. His face is a mess. Oh,

364
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,850
come throws a lot of off speed stuff too.
He does things.

365
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,180
He's really hard to figure out
what he's going to do. Yeah.

366
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:49,650
Okay.

367
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,510
Very sneaky with the way he moves at
you hit like slow, slow, fast. You know,

368
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:57,990
he does a lot of that nice left
hook there and it's hard to see.

369
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,770
It's a lot of times it's hard to see
punches it come from the hip like that.

370
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,310
Yeah. Very difficult. Especially,

371
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:05,250
we have good head movement and
he's got very good movement.

372
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:07,830
Very good waste movement back and forth.

373
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,090
Okay.

374
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,720
Damn. Yeah, I'm happy I don't have to
score this fucking thing. I really,

375
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,040
I just get to watch it and I have to worry
about it. Well, I just don't know man.

376
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:22,450
I just, I think if I was going to
score around and do, do my best at it,

377
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:25,210
I really would shut the fuck
up. Yeah, you'd have to. Yeah.

378
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,100
Which I'm sure some people would like.

379
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,900
I cannot, I've got to talking and score.
It's nice left hook again by carb.

380
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,000
This is all cub this round. Yeah,
totally. Jeremy's got to know that.

381
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,810
I mean this is a,
it's a very interesting situation.

382
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,860
I think you all my hinge on that
fourth round was real close.

383
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,840
Yeah. Right. Cause three
and five are definitely cub.

384
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,300
I would say one and two
are Stephen's right now.

385
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,460
Well this is all that fourth
round just looked up at the clock.

386
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,510
This is a perfect example of why one brown
being a ten nine and this round being

387
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:02,050
a ten nine is ridiculous. Yeah. So
the round that was really close,

388
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:04,060
if that was a ten nine for
either one of those guys.

389
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,690
And then this is a ten nine round for cub.
That's fucking crazy.

390
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,800
That highlights how fucked up the system
is because carb is schooling him in

391
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:15,310
this round and Cobb also schooled
him and that other route. Oh,

392
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:19,810
Jeremy Lands that right
hand. Woo. Still dangerous.

393
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,880
It's still dangerous. Fucking 24
minutes. 24 and a half minutes in.

394
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,170
Yup. Yeah. Good one. Yeah.
He carries her fucking power.

395
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,760
He'll switch it up to get you thinking
about that overhand and come with that

396
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:37,390
upper gut. Oh, we, y'all heard
him? He heard him. Who was
a stumble there, man. Damn.

397
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:42,200
Jeremy Stevens is swinging a hate
to see somebody lose a fight. Man.

398
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,410
That's a great fight. Wow.
Holy Shit. She's a great fight.

399
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,710
Look at these guys. Awesome. Fantastic
fight. I love this too. I love this.

400
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,630
I love these guys walking around, holding
each others arms up. Yeah, amazing.

401
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,870
Especially have to fight. And there was
a moment of pause when the bell rang.

402
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,870
We were still like, fuck you. Ah, goodbye.

403
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,470
Because Jerry was chasing after a moving
in for the kill and that last minute.

404
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,730
Wow. Amazing fight. I still
gave that last round to cub,

405
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,670
but that highlights why, you
know, it's like, what is that?

406
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:16,640
Is that a ten nine round?
Is that a ten eight what is it?

407
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:21,570
Ten eight you know what the fuck?
Why do we still have this 10 point system?

408
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,940
It's fucking goofy.

409
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,310
So what do you think you have
to judge if you had to guess.

410
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,020
I think cub did more damage. I would
say cub. Yeah. I would say to Cobb as,

411
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:38,021
I mean the problem is when you're looking
at that whole 10 point must system is,

412
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,670
is it going to be looked
like that at the judges?

413
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,660
So it's same right now that that Jeremy
broke his hand. Is that what they said?

414
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,720
That's what it says right
now. Dana White tweeted, oh,

415
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,690
he broke his hand and the
third round when or which hand?

416
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,960
I was thrown both there at the end. So
I was, I was trying to pay attention.

417
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,090
He's so crazy. He probably didn't bother
him at all. It goes numb. Yeah. Yeah.

418
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,850
You don't want to feel it. He probably
knew it and just kept bombing with it.

419
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,930
I fuck,
I mean I,

420
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,100
I crushed my hand and broke my knuckle
and like five pay up pieces and then

421
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:10,070
broke my hand too. Impacted it
and it just, you don't feel it.

422
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,040
I mean it's not like I'm like fuck
yeah, propane, you know, it's,

423
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,650
he just went numb and I think I,
you know,

424
00:25:14,651 --> 00:25:18,170
I threw a hundred and punches in the
makeup show that fist make a fist.

425
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,480
That's where it goes. A little
bridge right now. What's a little,

426
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:24,500
a little swollen credit.
I can land it in his fucking eye socket.

427
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,240
And when you're training,
what do you,

428
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,410
what do you do to me your hands
different with Boston gloves on it, it's,

429
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,180
it's the padding's there
so it helps out a lot.

430
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:35,420
But if I still put it in someone's
forehead or something or catch it on an

431
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,400
overhand, which is how I broke it. A,

432
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,970
it fucking hurts my fingers going
to break like this. I mean it's,

433
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,800
it's all fucking bruise right now, but
you know, it's all right. Like it is here.

434
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:46,634
It is.

435
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,903
Okay.

436
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,180
Cub Swanson. I thought it was just
fun. Yeah, I think that's justified.

437
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,720
I think it's justified in terms
of the overall fight. Yeah.

438
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,730
If you look at the overall fight, I think
that cub Swanson one, the overall fight,

439
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,990
definitely.

440
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,520
Jeremy had some moments in definitely
Jeremy scored a lot and had cub heard at

441
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:11,510
one point in time,
but

442
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,860
it's a good fight, man. Yeah,
really good. Yeah, that's,

443
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,300
that's the kind of fight that you want
to see when you see a guy who's fighting

444
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,090
for a world title next.
Yeah.

445
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,210
He fights another top guy in the division
to hungry young lions and both guys

446
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:37,550
had moments. You know, Jeremy had
some big moments in that fight,

447
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,210
but Cobb had more moments. It's
a big win for him, man. Yes. And

448
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,140
Jeremy Stevens being now
the harder hitter. He,

449
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,880
he stepped forward and
landed some good shots.

450
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,970
Cub had to do a lot of things
to keep that pressure on.

451
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,740
He didn't have that one shot power.

452
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,740
You had to show a lot of accuracy
through a lot of jabs mixed.

453
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:57,390
A lot of kicks in there.
A lot of head movement.

454
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,660
He had to do a lot more cause
he didn't have that power. Yeah.

455
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,100
That's an interesting, I like seeing
that person. Yeah, I do too. Well that's,

456
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,420
that's a kind of fight to,
that makes a guy really grow.

457
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:09,750
That's some serious fucking experience
you get there mentally. Just,

458
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,690
just your fight Iq goes up
fucking a lot of points.

459
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,010
When you fought like w who's,
who do you think is he?

460
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,490
See Ian Mccall when you
fought mighty mouse,

461
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:22,770
when you fought Benevidez what fight?

462
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,720
Do you have any fights
that you look back on?

463
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:27,840
He say that's the fight that
really I took the most from.

464
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,220
Ah,
I would say it'd be in Joe.

465
00:27:32,221 --> 00:27:35,160
I don't think either of us fought to our
full potential and that fight. How come?

466
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,560
I don't know. We just kinda
stood there. We didn't really,

467
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,210
neither of us move like we should have
it didn't get after it, you know? Um,

468
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,830
you know, I'm pretty disappointed my UFC
career, so I don't know. Are you willing?

469
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:55,660
Yeah, no. Dude, you are a perfectionist.

470
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,500
Striving to improve. Yeah. I should be
world champion. That's not good enough.

471
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,440
And I think that I, everyone knows
I'm the only threat to Demetrius.

472
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,120
Listen to you and you know it's I
fucking molester than once on the ground.

473
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:10,060
I'll do it again and get my fucking
hands on you. I'm gonna, I'm gonna.

474
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,450
I think that, you know what? I
don't have the best pair of Jujitsu.

475
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,040
I don't have the best pure wrestling.
I don't have the best pure striking,

476
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:22,990
but when it comes to getting in a fucking
fist fight and having it end up on the

477
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:25,480
ground,
I'll fuck up anybody in my weight class.

478
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,640
I don't think there's anybody who
can do it. Want to scramble with me.

479
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:30,940
You want to, you know,
with, with submissions and
shit like that and punches.

480
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:34,360
I'll fuck you up. What do you think
separates you? What do you think it is?

481
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:35,830
Okay.

482
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,440
Oh Man. I don't want to sound
like gene the bell too much,

483
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,070
but I do the belt and I get off
on it. You know, it's, it's,

484
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:44,920
and it's maybe not as sexual as
Jean Jean likes it to be, but I,

485
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,230
I thoroughly enjoy fucking people up,
man.

486
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,040
It's always entertaining. I got a lot of
pent up aggression. I like to perform.

487
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:57,050
I think performing's become
the biggest part. Just putting
on a show. Yeah. And if,

488
00:28:57,051 --> 00:29:01,360
if someone's, you know, their wellbeing
is at stake during that. I'm fuck,

489
00:29:01,361 --> 00:29:04,770
I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm not sorry.
And what car do you on next? Uh,

490
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:08,650
July 19th and Ireland. I'm fighting
Brad Pickett finally. Finally fight.

491
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,690
That's how you get your site in
English, man. And I am in the name. Wow.

492
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:16,930
I have a super gets, well, it's
Gaelic, it's uh, you know, it's Irish,

493
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,270
Scottish whales. I think it's a
Gaelic is oh, your last name. Yeah,

494
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,990
it's and we'll call you don't get
any more Irish than that, but sorry,

495
00:29:22,991 --> 00:29:26,830
I'm not Irish. Yeah, they're going to
be bummed out. Like put the fuck man.

496
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:31,360
You confusing us. We want to route
Irish and Mexican or something.

497
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,390
That's Hilarious, man. That's a good
fight though. I love that fight.

498
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:39,910
Brad pickets fun. He's a fun guy.
He's, I mean we're, we're gonna,

499
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,030
we're gonna get a bonus.
Did picket fight flyway yet?

500
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:48,160
Once it would be fine. Neil Neil, Siri,
the Irish guy. Did he win or lose?

501
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,310
He won but he looked like shit. Did
he? Yeah, I mean he tough weight cut.

502
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,960
I think that's what was a big part of it.

503
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:56,530
And you know you're supposed to be a
boxer and you get cracked and you'll turn

504
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:58,780
into a wrestler, but I'm not going
to get a Russell by an Englishman.

505
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,620
Embarrassing.
But I talk shit.

506
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,780
But I got fucking taken down
by a Brazilian so I've, I
jumped into it. But again,

507
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,040
I say stupid shit all the time. You're
comfortable with saying stupid shit. Yeah,

508
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:13,690
because it's entertainment,
you know,

509
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:16,120
I think people get buttered on Twitter
that should I say and I'm like,

510
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,050
motherfucker, you got a problem,
you can text me or something.

511
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,920
I have some people that
I know have gotten hurt.

512
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:25,180
The Internet is filled with people that
are not just bought her Lukey and to be

513
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:26,560
butt hurt and I'm just playing the game.

514
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,510
People have said the most horrible
shit to me online. I mean with,

515
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,150
with recent events, especially shit
that had been said to me, I'm like,

516
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,720
Jesus Christ, you guys are mean
because they don't going to feelings.

517
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,150
If I had a heart. Yeah. And this would
really suck. Not just mean, but mean.

518
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:46,510
And they don't even know you. Like,
it's not like they're angry at you.

519
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,330
They're trying to get back because you
did something to them that they can't

520
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:53,680
forgive. It's like, no, you don't have
any relationship with them at all.

521
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:57,250
They just reach out to you and just
try to shit on you because the life is

522
00:30:57,251 --> 00:31:00,190
fucking misery ever met before
because now you're saying some shit.

523
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,360
If you were in person,

524
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,090
I'd break this fucking Mug over
your head and stick it in the neck.

525
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,140
You want to fuck me? I mean
like what? What for what reason?

526
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:12,370
Just to try to get just a rise
out of you to ruin my day. Well,

527
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,580
it's because response from you because
they don't have anything going on in

528
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:20,080
their lives. Gotcha. Rogan mad
and he said something to me,

529
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,380
it's a big deal to them.
This is definitely true
that that's, that's a fact.

530
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,940
And that's a sure sign that you're a loser
because that's something that winners

531
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:31,540
don't do. I've always said that Michael
Jordan is not leaving youtube comments.

532
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,690
No. You know, he's not like shitting
all over someone who's fucking video.

533
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,150
You know what I mean? It's fucking song
blows scope. The dining a fire, you know,

534
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,110
that kind of attitude is almost always
perpetrated by losers and it's just a

535
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:48,670
matter of thinking a certain way that
you will constantly chase down an Ian

536
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,750
Mccall and shit all over.

537
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,990
I'm gonna try to hurt us feel and try to
try to reach them online and try to eat,

538
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:57,590
recognize me
fucking scene.

539
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,433
The Guy,

540
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,740
he's a fucking supposed to be a comedian
and he called that Louis C K for a

541
00:32:02,741 --> 00:32:06,010
fight to fight Louie who? Some
fucking guy, I don't know his name,

542
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:09,400
I don't fight Louis C K wants to fight
him. And he called out me and he says,

543
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:11,890
check this guy out, calling out
Louis C K and I was like, oh.

544
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:14,530
So I retweeted it and then I watched
it and I was like, is that you?

545
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,470
You're a fucking douchebag.
Horrible piece of shit.

546
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:19,060
And I'm sorry I fucking retweeted that.

547
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,790
But like you're the kind of guy that
I'm going to fucking spit in my hand and

548
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:23,860
slap you in the mouth with it.

549
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,870
Like so he's calling out Louis C K
because Lucy Kay is doing well. Exactly.

550
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:31,810
And then he calls me out.
Oh who the fuck you're talking to?

551
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,070
Like
weird.

552
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:38,980
And there's a lot of idiots out there but
those idiots think that that's the way

553
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,980
they can become famous.

554
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,900
That's the way they can get a
name, you know, credit card.

555
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:45,530
And he used to do the MMA uncensored
show. He's all right. He is.

556
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,080
Everybody hates the guy cause it's his,

557
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,490
he's like a New York loud mouth like
radio hosts and everybody hates him.

558
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,450
And we were doing a shoot.

559
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,740
I was on the show and he's actually
a nice guy in real life and he goes,

560
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,140
not one time with all the hate I get.

561
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,550
Has anyone in real life in person ever
said anything to me? I go, really?

562
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,070
He goes not once,
and he is hated.

563
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,440
Not like there's some people out
there that don't like you and me, Joe,

564
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:12,740
I'm talking like most people don't
like crit carton. He's liking them.

565
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,900
Noxious and they don't.

566
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,760
Most people I've talked to a
litter MMA fans like you a lot. Oh,

567
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,320
I think you do really well.
But yeah,

568
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:24,230
there are some people that
just get fucking universally,

569
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,820
there's some people I talked to a lot
of people that fucking hate Jon Jones,

570
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,630
you know, they're talking to me
about how John Jones is hated.

571
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:35,720
All my friends hate Jon Jones. He's
so fucking cocky. And I'm like,

572
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,660
let me help you out here. Here's
what's going on. You know?

573
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,870
And I know that Jon Jones is awesome
and that's one of the things that's

574
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:44,180
bothering you. Is it? Jon
Jones knows he's awesome.

575
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,850
Does he do things that are debatable?
Yeah,

576
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:50,270
he got in an accident with a Bentley
when he was drunk with a bunch of strip,

577
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,133
presume his car.

578
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,440
Me like he was having a
good time and have a night.

579
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,970
You can't get a lot of us in that.
So what are you mad at?

580
00:33:57,971 --> 00:34:00,000
You mad at the fact that he thinks
he's going to win every fight.

581
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,650
Guess why he won every fight. So he's
driving, you know like what do you matter?

582
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,370
I don't understand that. You mad
that he's, he's ducking Gustafson.

583
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,570
He wanted to fight Daniel fucking
core me a Olympic wrestler.

584
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:13,660
Undefeated both as a heavyweight
and as a light heavyweight.

585
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:17,620
A guy who's been running through
people destroyed Dan Henderson.

586
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,150
He wants to fight him and you
think he's a coward. Yeah,

587
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,280
that makes a lot of sense. People
are fucking stupid. Look the simple,

588
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:27,700
the simple phrase of go ahead and
explain yourself. Yeah. Tiers.

589
00:34:27,701 --> 00:34:31,480
Most people completely of, no, just tick
that tick. Tick that logic a bit further.

590
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,480
I just want to, I just want to hear
you express it. One piece at a time.

591
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,740
All said everything falls apart.

592
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:40,030
The other thing that fucks people up is
the platform of being able to do like a

593
00:34:40,031 --> 00:34:45,031
Twitter post or a blog entry or you know
anything where you're not addressing

594
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:49,000
the human.
A person's not challenging what Cannibal.

595
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,910
Like if you're saying something,
even if you're saying something to me,

596
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,620
if you're not talking to Jon Jones,

597
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:56,170
you're saying something to me that doesn't
make any sense. I'll go, wait, hold on.

598
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,940
What? I'll stop you if the first
paragraph and go, that's not even true.

599
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,920
That doesn't make sense.
Well here's why.

600
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:08,070
But instead they get to just buy through
a whole entire blog entry and justify

601
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:13,870
their thoughts or what
unchecked and by the end of it,

602
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,540
you know somebody reads it,
they'll get angry,

603
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:18,010
they'll have all these opinions on it,

604
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:20,660
but it would have never happened
if they were interactive.

605
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,040
There was an experiment at Stanford
University where they put people in masks

606
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:30,070
and had them shock people and that is
that a control group or one subject didn't

607
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:32,960
have masks on and they were behind this
glass and they were shocking people.

608
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,390
When they would answer a question,
question certain way,

609
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,720
then they took a group of will and put
masks on them and did the same experiment

610
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,700
and people would hit the button
like incessantly. When there was,

611
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,010
they wouldn't even ask a question.
They would just shock them.

612
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,200
As soon as they became anonymous,

613
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,260
they will hit that fucking thing when
they said the right answer when they

614
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:52,380
didn't even talk in and they
realize when you make people,

615
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:56,850
and this is like 1972 and they realize
when you make people anonymous,

616
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,570
they will do horrible shit
incessantly and well Susie,

617
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,131
what mask on?

618
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:05,010
They would hit the shock button
constantly throughout the experiment.

619
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,890
Why do you think the KKK wore masks?
People are shitty.

620
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,400
People can be under the flushing
shitty but also awesome. You know,

621
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,290
people are pretty fucking awesome. I all,
my favorite people are people. The way,

622
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,320
the way I look at it personally,
that's, that's a great statement.

623
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,140
The way my favorite people or
animals and throwing that out there.

624
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:24,870
I know I like pets and shit.
I'm going to monkeys and shit.

625
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:29,220
My as monkeys do have shit and they
do have shit and they fling it.

626
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,900
My thing is like I like,
you know,

627
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,700
if I like something I'm a,

628
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:40,701
I'm a reasonable normal human being and
I don't like pickles and I liked the

629
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:41,850
Pittsburgh Steelers.

630
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,880
I've never gone online and talked
about either one of those subjects.

631
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,360
Most people didn't like something or
don't want to just go, oh yeah. I'm like,

632
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,410
you know,
Jimmy Smith is all right.

633
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,780
They're not going to get on
a form and yell about me.

634
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,190
It's the vast majority people that likes
something and just enjoy it generally

635
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:57,930
don't make a big deal,

636
00:36:57,931 --> 00:37:02,931
but we're talking about very slender part
of the population that it's just loud,

637
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:05,540
obnoxious about stuff. Yeah.
No matter what you know,

638
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,600
no matter what you do in the smart phone,
right.

639
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,450
Every asshole has a fucking voice.
Now.

640
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,250
Everybody's going to pin this
thing about being anonymous. I must

641
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,430
be able to reach people. This is
unprecedented in human culture. Yeah.

642
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,230
It's never happened before, so people
don't know how to fucking deal with it.

643
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,330
They don't know how to manage it.
It's just,

644
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:26,410
it's not a ability that
anybody's ever had in history.

645
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,670
So this ability is something that it's
going to take a long time for people to

646
00:37:30,671 --> 00:37:34,120
manage and use and I think what's going
to change it more than anything is it's

647
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:36,430
somewhere along the line we're
going to lose it. Not anonymity.

648
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,130
I think everyone's going to
know who everyone else is.

649
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,720
You're going to be accountable
at the NSA. Yeah, it's gonna.

650
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,180
It's exactly like if you were doing
death threats to the government,

651
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,590
they know who you are immediately.
You could try to hide behind a proxy,

652
00:37:50,591 --> 00:37:52,450
but if you're,
they're going to find you,

653
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,680
they're going to find you really quickly
and ultimately that kind of ability is

654
00:37:56,681 --> 00:37:59,690
going to trickle down to the common man.
Everyone's going to have that.

655
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,653
Yeah you do.

656
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,030
And the world is going to know that
you're a cunt for doing that too.

657
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:07,090
Have you found out like you remember
that reddit thing that happened a while

658
00:38:07,091 --> 00:38:10,870
back where there was a guy who would post
all kinds of fucked up shit on reddit

659
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,240
and he like like creep shots,

660
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:17,590
like up skirt shots and stuff and underage
shots and all these different weird

661
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:18,424
creepy shit.

662
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:22,330
And then they found out who he was in
real life and they contacted his employer

663
00:38:22,331 --> 00:38:23,860
and showed him all the
stuff that he put on line.

664
00:38:23,861 --> 00:38:27,820
They fire that fucking guy could well
and the guy had like a wife and kids and

665
00:38:27,821 --> 00:38:32,260
the whole deal and you know like lost
his job and he got outed on the Internet

666
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:36,100
and you know, millions of people
hated that guy after that. So many

667
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,910
people got ahold of the articles and
retweeted things and Facebook didn't.

668
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,050
It was a big issue,

669
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:44,440
a big issue about freedom of speech
and privacy but also a big issue about

670
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:48,820
outing fuckheads. Yeah.
Good. Fuck them. Yup. Yeah.

671
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,790
Fuck them all. Fuck them all
says Ian Mccall. Rimes and rimes.

672
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,010
Really well. So a, the
fights are over gentlemen.

673
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,730
I guess the podcast is over to this
has been a great time. Yes, this is,

674
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:05,020
it hasn't been fucking fun. Three hours.
We put this together this afternoon too.

675
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,050
Yeah, I got a call this afternoon
we doing tonight. Nothing Bro.

676
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:11,800
What's going on and was like,
I am there. I am there. Yeah.

677
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:13,300
This is a lot of work on my seat,
man.

678
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:17,380
I'll be there and I really wanted to do
with you too because I mean I don't know

679
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:20,200
how many people know that we were really
friendly with each other. You know,

680
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,890
despite the fact that we're supposed to
be something we're supposed to knock,

681
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:25,120
I guess we're supposed to be rivals.

682
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:28,310
There's some shit are not going along
with the whole Bjorn Dana thing.

683
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:32,200
That's so goofy to me. It's what, you
know when you, when I was talking to,

684
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:35,020
I mean the way I see it is if
there's a rivalry in UFC, in Beltour,

685
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:40,300
at what level does that really happen?
Like when I see Kenny are you, it's like,

686
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,930
hey, what's like we're peers,
we do the same job. We like,
hey, how's it going man?

687
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:46,030
We talked about fire to
whatever and you know,

688
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:48,730
I know you know a lot of the technical
people that have worked on both shows and

689
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:49,541
like they don't get along.

690
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:53,170
It's not the director sees my director
and starts a fight or something like fuck

691
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,230
you. Yeah. Does my work that way. It's
really good. You know? It's funny,

692
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,420
I ran into some dude's last, a small
like foster man. I love that guy. Yeah,

693
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,260
great guy. He's a great
guy. My boy, I love him.

694
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,920
I ran into some guys last night that it
just Jujitsu guys and we talked to Jitsu

695
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:07,330
till two o'clock in the fucking morning.

696
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,020
That's like when you run into someone
who likes what you like and you start

697
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:14,740
talking like, I mean I don't
understand. I don't know.

698
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:17,500
I've never understood that though.
I've supported the people's podcasts,

699
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:21,190
I've always supported other comedians.
I just, I don't, I don't see that.

700
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,300
I think the main competition is always
with yourself and when you bring in

701
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:28,930
someone else who's good or
you have someone around you
that's good and you have

702
00:40:28,931 --> 00:40:31,120
to compare yourself to them,
I think it makes you better.

703
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:34,210
So I think it's important. Every
true, you see that a lot in MMA man.

704
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:35,920
How many times you see
guys that are training,

705
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,040
they're in the same God damn
weight class and they're,

706
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:41,140
they're helping each other out and you
know that one day they might have to

707
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:46,141
fight like your riot and
t and Tj Dillashaw after
Uriah loses to hand Barao he

708
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:48,160
says, Hey, you know
there's a guy in my camp,

709
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:51,530
I'd love to see him fight for the title
next. I love to see him. See Tj Dillashaw.

710
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:52,270
I get a shot.

711
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:57,270
Same fucking way class beating
each other's asses every
day and still supporting

712
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:00,700
him. That's the fucking,
that's a brotherhood right
there. That's where it's at,

713
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:02,260
right?
That's where it's not that big.

714
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:05,230
I think that's what people don't get
is community is not that big. No.

715
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,150
We all know one another.
At least.

716
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:10,440
There's like two degrees of separation
in this entire sport. Maybe.

717
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,450
How many of us are they? Not at, not
a lot of us out there. Jason Chambers,

718
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,270
who's a friend of mine who does a one FC.
Yep.

719
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,810
There's you who Smith who
I fought Jason Chambers.

720
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,770
Like it's just like there's only
one degree of separation. This tire.

721
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:27,610
You guys both had a TV show where you're
traveling around and doing different

722
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:31,060
martial arts. He did human weapon. I
didn't fight quest. He keep called me.

723
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:34,670
Send me a message. As soon as Fike
was came out and goes, hey man, great.

724
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,160
See on TV man, hope we get to the
to hang out soon. I was like, Hey,

725
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,130
good luck with your thing too bro. And
like Jason's, it's like what we're,

726
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:44,360
you know, we're gonna you know Jason,
he's right over again. We already did one.

727
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,760
It's ridiculous. It
doesn't work that way. No.

728
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,220
You know Anthony Bourdain
and Andrew Zimmerman, he had,

729
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,830
I'm going to like to have a brawl

730
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,830
traveling. I mean, how many
of us are there? There's now,

731
00:41:57,831 --> 00:41:59,320
there's a couple of
fighters would do at Kenney.

732
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:03,120
Brian Stand and Frank Mir
used to do it until what?

733
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,270
He said he wanted to kill
Brock Lesnar in the ring,

734
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:09,680
one of the houses to be the first
MMA death in ring. Not Smart.

735
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,960
Well not the smart, but still. I
don't think it's like, you know,

736
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,810
the guy's a great commentator who's nearly
good. Yeah. I enjoyed his commentary,

737
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:22,850
but I mean there's only the point
being this may be 10 of us worldwide.

738
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,430
I mean, I don't know who
does that Indian promotion.

739
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,790
They still have that Indian promotion
superfly league or something.

740
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,120
I know there's one bag for a little while.
The Arab Emirates you at Uva,

741
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,910
UAE. Um, one of my buddies
is fighting out there soon.

742
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,740
Is that a new organization?
I think so.

743
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,580
You know how much money
they have to think of.

744
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,920
It's hard to think of any job or
they're a few fewer people doing it,

745
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:48,440
then it would make commentary. There
are a dozen of us in the whole world.

746
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:52,670
Like how many jobs are there? Yeah,
there they're 10 of us. Yeah, no shit.

747
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,580
[inaudible] CEO, there's, you
know, several hundred. Yeah. Yeah.

748
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,450
That was why we can run an inch with
her into each other and talk shit,

749
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:04,260
talk shop rather just what we do general.
Yeah. How many of us are this is,

750
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,040
that's it. That's interesting. Yeah.
That's probably as far as others,

751
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,880
like the two major promotions
that anyone has seen,

752
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:14,840
president of the United
States is probably, you know,
that's a singular biggie.

753
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,130
It's a biggie when you run into
former presidents, you're fucking but,

754
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:22,610
but there's a former presidents as far
as people doing the job currently, man.

755
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,240
Yeah, I guess boxing commentators,
but there's probably way more of them.

756
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,340
More boxing on TV too.
Well they always do more guys to,

757
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:33,590
like I was listening to some
boxing last night and it was like,

758
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,660
which I don't like in MMA. Yeah, but they
do them in boxing. Well it can fuck up.

759
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:42,950
Especially if you know you got too many
people talking over each other when

760
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:47,390
action happens or they don't like specific
roles like especially when it comes

761
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:47,780
to,

762
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,870
I think you and I both do something very
different than other sports too where

763
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:55,790
there's a color guy and a play by play,
but we both do play by play. We do color,

764
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,110
but we also do play by play,

765
00:43:57,111 --> 00:44:00,980
especially when shit goes to the ground
because the play by play guy doesn't

766
00:44:00,981 --> 00:44:03,980
really know what the fuck is happening.
What they do a little,

767
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,990
but you kind of have to do that.
Well,

768
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:10,991
you have to explain every nuance of the
position and then start to explain what

769
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,480
could be bad if this happens.
And what could be good if that happens.

770
00:44:14,481 --> 00:44:16,910
Or women amaze the color medium.
I,

771
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:20,900
it's Jeff Blatnick who I love,
Love Jeff Blatnick. He was,

772
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:24,540
I thought it was a great, as a rescue
is a great, great human being. Um,

773
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,740
when he started doing color
commentary for the UFC,

774
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,500
it became a color medium just
because if you, if you watch boxing,

775
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,950
my mom knows what's happening in boxing
match you d I mean they would ask

776
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:37,920
Emmanuel steward little stuff and,
or you know,

777
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:41,970
it was George Foreman for awhile at
Hbo and, but the play by play guy,

778
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:46,020
that's the voice of Hbo is
Jim Lampley Basically, um,

779
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,090
with MMA color,

780
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:50,760
guys have to talk a lot more because
there's a lot more of the audience doesn't

781
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:53,880
know the answer is never done Jujitsu.
The answer has never done Muay Thai.

782
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,640
The audience knows boxing a little bit.
They'd never wrestled.

783
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:00,840
So there's so many facets that the fans
have just never been a part of that.

784
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,330
We have to break down and
explain and I think it's made it,

785
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,300
the color guys have to do a lot
more than them. It made them,

786
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:08,310
they do in boxing a lot more. Yeah, more.

787
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:11,870
It's a completely different gig
and that's also, it's also a,

788
00:45:11,871 --> 00:45:16,410
a gig that would be really cumbersome
with a bunch of people talking if you had

789
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:19,440
like three or four people in the booth.
We've done three in the UFC before,

790
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:20,550
but it didn't work that well.

791
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,060
And Dana didn't like it and so they
went back to two. Yeah, it's brief.

792
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:25,040
The Times I've done it in Beltsville,

793
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:28,260
they'll have like somebody jumped
in for around it too. Yeah.

794
00:45:28,261 --> 00:45:29,670
I think what would be,
yeah,

795
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,210
I think we'll be cool as a guy doing
the Harold Letterman Gig though,

796
00:45:33,211 --> 00:45:36,180
that Eddie Bravo used to do. Yeah.
You know, Eddie's too busy these days.

797
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:39,510
He wouldn't do it. But someone who's
like a real experienced guy, like uh,

798
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,400
you know,
that would be a good thing to do.

799
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:43,730
Like to have like a
dominant Cruz or you know,

800
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:47,250
someone along that lines who's
really good at breaking things down.

801
00:45:47,251 --> 00:45:49,170
It's very analytical.
Give some,

802
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:53,130
I think it would help give people some
insight and also give some insight as to

803
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:55,140
really what's wrong with the scoring.

804
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,100
We could see if you've got a real
expert at breaks down exactly what they

805
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:02,940
thought about each individual aspect of
the fight and then you see in contrast

806
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:06,150
how shitty the the judges
perceptions of the fight where, yeah,

807
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,600
I'd probably say sign me up
and I'd probably say some stuff

808
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:13,090
[inaudible] shit.
Well,

809
00:46:13,091 --> 00:46:16,490
you know what I've liked and elected
Josh Barnett has a blog now or has a

810
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,170
podcast now. I think, you know, you'd be
great at something like that too, man.

811
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,010
We've thought about it. I've had a
few people kind of hit me up about it.

812
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:28,011
We have a business called a direct
endorsement where we do live streaming for

813
00:46:28,021 --> 00:46:31,530
only for an hour and we take an athlete,
not just fighting, but fighting,

814
00:46:31,531 --> 00:46:35,700
skateboarding, motorcross, whatever it is.
They pick a charity, we pick a product,

815
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,820
say it's this Mug,
everyone buys the mug. We,

816
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,640
as we're doing that through
the, you know, the, the,

817
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,460
the podcast that person's signing
while we're talking, asking questions,

818
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,500
we get into what the charity is
and it's just, it's, you know,

819
00:46:47,501 --> 00:46:51,720
like whatever percentage they want.
Usually 20% goes to the, the, uh,

820
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:54,950
the charity they pick. So that's very
cool. It's a cool little thing we had,

821
00:46:54,951 --> 00:46:58,600
we only had three of them. We
did myself. We did a quick,

822
00:46:58,601 --> 00:47:02,100
let's go for skateboarding and Kyle Loza
for motocross and we'd like to get on

823
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:05,130
the ball and start doing more. Might you
Donal Logue for acting and just some,

824
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,060
you know,
just to kind of,

825
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,990
just to hit different surfaces
just because I don't have,

826
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,880
I don't really hang out
with fighters that much.

827
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:14,380
Yeah, no, that's interesting. So what,

828
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:16,720
you only hung out with fighters from
your training when you get outside of

829
00:47:16,721 --> 00:47:17,530
training?

830
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:20,500
Yeah, I mean, realistically I'm the
hanging out people at the gym. If I'm not,

831
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:22,450
not at the gym,
I'm at home with my kid.

832
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,950
But a lot of people that are fighters
find that they're the only people that

833
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:30,070
understand them, that other fighters
like it's such a crazy lifestyle

834
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,530
to the training. So brutal. The,

835
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:35,800
it's almost like you need someone to
commiserate with or you need someone who

836
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:40,000
understands what you're going through.
You don't feel like that. Um, I do,

837
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:43,950
but I don't want to talk about it.
I want to just fucking forget about it.

838
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:44,960
I want to hang out with my,
you know,

839
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,980
with my kid and my girlfriend and her
kid and just not have to worry about the

840
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:54,100
fucking misery that I put myself through
for, for, for greatness. You know, it's,

841
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:56,140
it's a lot of fun. I love
my job. Don't get me wrong,

842
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:58,630
but I'd usually don't want
to talk about it, you know,

843
00:47:58,631 --> 00:48:02,590
unless it's on something like this. So
you're, you preserve your interest in it.

844
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:05,260
Yeah, because otherwise, you know, I do.

845
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,360
I've been watching more fights
lately now that I, you know,

846
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:09,700
meet me and my dad lived together.
That's a fucking all he does.

847
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,420
And my daughter loves watching fights.
That's hilarious.

848
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,250
A two and a half year old, loves watching
fights and she now, you know, she sees,

849
00:48:15,251 --> 00:48:18,220
you know, uncle Shane's on the TV, you
know, this person's on the TV, this Romy,

850
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:23,170
there's, you know, coach or whatever.
It is cute. That is cute. Um, when you,

851
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,690
when you're in between camps,
like say like after a fight and you,

852
00:48:26,691 --> 00:48:28,240
you don't have anything
scheduled for a while,

853
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:32,170
how much time do you spend training and
working on things and how much is just,

854
00:48:32,171 --> 00:48:35,560
just decompressing?
I live a very active lifestyle.

855
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,510
Like everything I do is outdoors.
You know, I'm in Tahoe, Reno a lot,

856
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,930
high altitude, so we're always going on
hikes and I'm always doing, you know,

857
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:47,470
high altitude beaker and with
my girlfriend and w we just,

858
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,150
she doesn't let me fucking sit still.

859
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,470
Like she always has something to do with
the kids are with me and her or fucking

860
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,730
it. We've even for traveling, like
went to Costa Rica for a surf trip.

861
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:01,330
So we served him at jungle hiking and
tried to find fucking Sloss and monkeys

862
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:05,680
and shit. I know. So it's
like, if she keeps, it keeps
my attention going and, and I,

863
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:09,280
I'm always fit. That's cool.
That's a cool vacation. Yeah.

864
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:12,610
Except for the diseases and the bugs
that can kill you. See any of those.

865
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:18,010
Everything wants to kill you down. Yeah.
I mean, it's not like you got to Hawaii.

866
00:49:18,011 --> 00:49:20,350
Like I went to Hilo and hung
out with Bj and we went to Ypo.

867
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,700
I'm looking around like,
where's your bugs? Yeah, well
there's fucking mosquitoes.

868
00:49:24,701 --> 00:49:27,910
But besides that, I'm like, there's
nothing here that wants to kill me.

869
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,310
Even the mosquitoes I
think came from people.

870
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:34,190
They brought him over on boats and
shit. He's like, no bro, he's cool. No,

871
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:38,520
we're just going to hang out. And if, you
know, farm some farms from Taro. Okay.

872
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:43,500
Bj has been there his whole life and still
trains there. That's crazy. Yeah. We, we,

873
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,110
we finished building the gym in Ypo,
his little Dojo,

874
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:52,120
I call it my Miyagi. And, uh, and then one
morning I woke up, I was like, hey bro,

875
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,410
I'm gonna go want to go bust the gym.
Like, yeah, it's a great, grab your shit.

876
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,270
Let's go. And we just fucking drove
the Ypo and it's got a sh, you know,

877
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:02,500
little shitty old truck it doesn't care
about and drives it through the river

878
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:07,090
and it's got no, no, no. Uh, no electrical
has been shorted so it's no, no, uh,

879
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:08,500
no radio or anything.

880
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,770
He just drives through the most
fucking beautiful country you can.

881
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:16,060
And then we go in there and we just beat
the shit out of each other, you know,

882
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:16,960
half an hour.
We had some,

883
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:20,110
some shirtless fucking hippie
dude doing the time for us.

884
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,760
He used to like wrestle and high
school is, I'll stocking so we get,

885
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,110
can you just tell us when five
minutes is up? Okay. Ready? Go.

886
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:30,670
How many live in Hilo have no idea.
Not that, not that many, right.

887
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:34,280
It's like 30,000 or something crazy
because just the big island itself,

888
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,250
not a lot of people live in the big eye
on the big items. Fucking huge. Yeah.

889
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:41,720
I think the big island only has 100,000
people on it probably. And I mean it's,

890
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:45,530
it's, it's desolate. And
on the big island alone,

891
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:50,330
there's like every single climate in
the world except for like one or two.

892
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,560
It's, it's, it's, there's so much going
on there. It's so fucking beautiful.

893
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:57,220
You look and feel like you're in Jurassic
Park and especially getting to hang

894
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:00,650
out with him. It's, he's a fucking
savage man. It's a good time.

895
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:05,240
What do you think about this fight with
him and Frankie Edgar? He, like I said,

896
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:08,030
when I was out there, this is a while
ago, two months ago or something,

897
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:12,320
he was 160 pounds.
I got tired first and I don't,

898
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:15,800
I don't get fucking tired. I mean,
granted I just tore my hip and my groin,

899
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,820
but I still don't get tired much.
And he was,

900
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:22,190
I still stayed in shape and I mean,
he fucking,

901
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:27,050
he was going after me for
half an hour. Wow. And I was
just like, after I was like,

902
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:30,830
Oh, I'm fucking, I'm excited because he,
it's my favorite fighter of all time.

903
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,220
I mean, he's a fucking savage when you
can make another man cry, another man who,

904
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:37,220
who deserves a title shot at your title.

905
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,970
And you can beat him up so bad that he
cries and then you fucking lick his blood

906
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:44,070
off your gloves and bang your
head after I like, I like,

907
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,540
oh the Joe Stevenson place.

908
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:51,190
The problem is on throwing the counter
here is that he's always had trouble with

909
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,590
fights where he wasn't on top,
at least mentally.

910
00:51:53,591 --> 00:51:57,040
When the ball starts rolling
the other way, it rolls bad.

911
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,810
The momentum goes the other way for him.

912
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:03,130
And so Eric is the guy you got to outwork
and that's as it always been physical

913
00:52:03,131 --> 00:52:05,650
with Bj. It's when I'm not on
top and I'm not dominating,

914
00:52:05,651 --> 00:52:07,780
when I'm not licking the
guy's blood off my hands,

915
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,920
I start questioning myself and I started
rolling backwards and if he's got those

916
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:16,390
mental demons in check, then he's got
a great shot. Yeah, it's the same.

917
00:52:16,391 --> 00:52:20,740
Frankie Edgar always shows up and that's
saint consistent, so consistent, so hard.

918
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:24,880
Bj was so good when he's with the
Marinovich bitches when he fought Diego

919
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,940
Sanchez, he was in incredible shape.
He had a fucking full six pack.

920
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:32,350
I mean he was in shape and chasing
after Diego deep into the fight.

921
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:35,980
Fourth and fifth round going to hit
him twice, doesn't it? Open, open.

922
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,430
That was the only time Bj's ever
thrown a head kick in a fight.

923
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:41,440
Fucking landed perfect. Perfectly.
You know, I mean that was a,

924
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,800
that was him at his best because
he had tremendous stamina.

925
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,270
What do you know what he's doing now?
Oh,

926
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,370
for strength and
conditioning. I farming. Yeah.

927
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,480
What are, what are we doing? And
we're going to go farm manual labor.

928
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:55,810
I don't need fucking
strength conditioning.

929
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,060
We don't need strength and conditioning.

930
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:03,820
We just built roads in Ypo and fucking
Farm Taro and beat the shit out of each

931
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:08,920
other. Build the roads. We built like a
fucking, and like with like a unum og,

932
00:53:08,921 --> 00:53:09,980
you know,
like Mercedes Union mugs,

933
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,480
you can put a fucking ditch
digger on the back and like,

934
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:17,110
I don't know what an [inaudible] is. A
big, uh, like a tractor kind of vehicle.

935
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:22,000
Big Mercedes unit. Mog All three of
them out there. And he has a farm. Yeah,

936
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:26,030
he's got a farm and you go into Ypo
valley and it's, there's, I mean,

937
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,490
not even a hundred people live there and
it's this huge fucking garden of Eden.

938
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:33,420
I mean it's massive and it's so
beautiful and just there nothing there.

939
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,730
Is he growing weed?
I wish I was he farming Tara.

940
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:42,350
Tara is Tara. If you say quietly into a
mic, they can still hear you should poops.

941
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,680
Makes no difference. Bring it
up. What is he was Taro? Taro is,

942
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,950
they're trying to make it to try and make
the Hawaiian superfood a Taro root and

943
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:54,540
it's, it's, it's a really starchy,
starchy vegetable that, you know,

944
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:57,960
that's why Hawaiians punched so
hard. That's what they tell me. Yeah.

945
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,110
My first fight was in Hawaii.
I had never heard a terrible before.

946
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:04,740
How about how have I never heard of this
before? It tastes like, like put like,

947
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,770
like bland is fuck and put sugar
in it and tastes like sugar.

948
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:12,660
But it's supposed to give you superpowers.
You know, it's, it's a matter before,

949
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:14,840
I don't remember where, but I've
had it before. What did you,

950
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,480
what's your impression of it? It's like
a, like a, like a more bland kind of Yam.

951
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,000
Yeah. This is the best way
to describe it, Huh? Yeah,

952
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:25,110
but it's super the soupy like [inaudible]
gooey. Huh? Weird. They mash it up.

953
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:27,900
I had it mashed up with something
that was like a Tarot kind of stew.

954
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,150
Is it supposed to be good for you?
Like actually like that's,

955
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,280
it's not supposed to be good for you.
It's fucking weird and purple.

956
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:41,370
That's a unit Mog oh, okay. So the,
the local Hawaii. Does anybody else?

957
00:54:41,371 --> 00:54:43,060
He did. Is it anything
that like, you know,

958
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:45,720
everybody's eating like Bok
Choy now is the new Kale.

959
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,960
Everybody's telling you you got to
get ahold of some Bok Choy but he eats

960
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:53,370
[inaudible] in Hawaii.
But Dino Hawaiians are fucking,

961
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:57,160
they believe in like mermaids and shit.
Brother [inaudible]

962
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,710
and I love to death.
Don't get me wrong.

963
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:04,680
I love Hawaiians and like they're my
favorite fucking people on the planet.

964
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,190
Like that's the only place I vacation.
I lived with two fucking Hawaiians for,

965
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,860
you know, I live with Shane
and rich, rich who know rich.

966
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:12,860
He used to run Strikeforce.

967
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:16,380
He was mean match metric for Strikeforce
and they're both fucking Hawaiian.

968
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:18,930
And then I dunno,
I just really like fucking lines.

969
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,630
I tried vacation other the places. I'm
like, this isn't as good as Hawaiian.

970
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:24,780
Why am I fucking, I go
anywhere. Well Hawaii's right
there. It's going to Hawaii.

971
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,710
It's cheat. Well kind of. She is
still America but it's not, you know,

972
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:31,000
it's like you're protected by
the constitution to the alleged.

973
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,920
Go to Bj's and go to have him take you
to Ypo and you feel like you're in French

974
00:55:34,921 --> 00:55:36,840
Polynesia or something
cause the people talking.

975
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:40,850
You're just like all meeting income goal
by some fees. You know, buckle around,

976
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,770
smoke some weed bro. High School. And
you're like, what did he just say?

977
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:51,090
Phrasebook that pigeon talking to Brian
and Bj starts rattling off stuff and

978
00:55:51,091 --> 00:55:52,080
then you start drinking,

979
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,260
you know like homemade sock aid down
in the valley and then you just,

980
00:55:55,261 --> 00:55:59,520
it just turns into it, I imagine
short food. Yeah. What plate lunches?

981
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,940
Manchild food. How am I supposed
to fucking make weight with this?

982
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:06,420
This is delicious, but it's not on
my diet. Yeah. I remember one of the,

983
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:09,330
one of the countdown shows Bj when he was,
uh,

984
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:13,230
he had apparently burned off
too many calories, he said,
so it's time to load up.

985
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:17,190
So we had one of those local Moco
burgers with an egg on it and everything.

986
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,520
And you get fucking get your,
your,

987
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:24,100
your Mac Salad and you're fucking
chicken Katsu or, and it's just,

988
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:28,390
they, you know, they're, they are
island people. They're fucking crazy.

989
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:30,040
And it's just so entertaining
to hang out with them.

990
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:33,190
I just go out there and like, oh my
God, okay, what are we doing today?

991
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:37,270
Do you think you'd live there though?
Yeah, but like Bj, I want to move to Reno,

992
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,580
you know, and that's
pretty just, you know,

993
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,140
cause it's might be the only guy on the
planet that wants to move to never heard,

994
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:48,190
never heard in my life.

995
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:54,690
And it's, it's fucking, you
girlfriend lives there. Yeah.
And we'll then move. Yeah.

996
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,760
But it's, you know, it's wilderness
enough where you're, I mean,

997
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,730
you fucking seen Nevada parts in Nevada
and you're like, where the fuck am I?

998
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,250
Right. Yeah. There's parts of Nevada
where they have crazy elk hunting. Yeah.

999
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,960
Where there were bugling elks and you
hear these elks like fucking 1200 pound

1000
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:10,630
beats come rolling over the hill.
30 and 40 of them at a time.

1001
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,000
Her cousins are all trappers and hunters,
hunters out there.

1002
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,590
They're like the two of the
best young guys out there.

1003
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:17,080
Isn't that funny that people don't think
about that when they think of Nevada?

1004
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:19,930
I think of only Vegas nuclear waste.

1005
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,410
The Safari Club is the biggest fucking
incredible club in the credible nature

1006
00:57:23,411 --> 00:57:27,110
out in the back. Yeah. Yeah. Oh well,
especially up near Lake Tahoe is,

1007
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:32,190
it's fucking 7,000 feet and you go hiking
and you go running and do whatever the

1008
00:57:32,711 --> 00:57:36,130
fuck you wanna do. You get in shape
quick. Yeah. And it's beautiful too.

1009
00:57:36,131 --> 00:57:38,550
It's inspiring how
beautiful it is, man. My,

1010
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,260
my grandparents have a spot right on
the lake down there and it's, it's,

1011
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:45,530
it's fucking incredible. I mean
it is so nice. And you know,

1012
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:49,120
I just pulling in grandma's yard and go,
go down to the dock and just like,

1013
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,630
oh and plus my, no, my girlfriend, she's
the face of Harrison Harvey's up there.

1014
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,940
What is that? She's the big
hotels up there. Oh she's,

1015
00:57:56,730 --> 00:58:00,940
they pay her to just fucking stand
around. Oh that's cool. So to sweet Gig,

1016
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:05,200
deep down, it doesn't suck. Isn't all
meth down up there though isn't Reno?

1017
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:07,600
There's parts of Reno that is shit,
don't get me wrong there.

1018
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:08,860
Knows Reno nine one one there.

1019
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:13,630
But like if you go to the [inaudible]
out the mad cat hilarity like the free

1020
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,050
fun.

1021
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:16,840
If you go to the free fund like the river
and people that blow up mattresses is

1022
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:19,090
going down and shit. But
if you can just, you know,

1023
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:21,070
say that's hilarious and then kind of,
you know,

1024
00:58:21,071 --> 00:58:24,760
have your own life and do your own thing.
I just liked seclusion.

1025
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:27,950
I'm I becoming more secluded and,
and again back to like Bj has, he,

1026
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:30,460
he'll go stir crazy and then
he'll go train over here.

1027
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:34,240
I'll go train in Brazil and he gets away
and get away from your family and kids.

1028
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,610
Yeah. Yeah. I think that also too,

1029
00:58:37,611 --> 00:58:41,330
you live in a place in Orange
County that is super congested.

1030
00:58:41,331 --> 00:58:44,570
There's so many people came there.
Yeah. I'm not a fan of that either.

1031
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:49,460
So when you go somewhere else,
like take a a place where like Reno,

1032
00:58:49,461 --> 00:58:51,500
which is just,
especially at near Tahoe,

1033
00:58:51,501 --> 00:58:53,920
where it's just all nature and
beautiful and you feel like

1034
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:59,700
you feel it's relaxed, you're not
stuck in traffic for 20 minutes,

1035
00:58:59,701 --> 00:59:02,920
you're going to go two miles in
20 minutes. I mean, that's a,

1036
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,490
if you're in Vegas and you know you're,

1037
00:59:05,491 --> 00:59:09,180
you're trying to go down the strip and
you're trying to go from one in this trip

1038
00:59:09,181 --> 00:59:12,780
to the other end on a Friday
night, good fucking luck. You know,

1039
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:17,580
it might take you hours. Yeah. And
that's, that's every day in Orange County.

1040
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,230
Every day. I mean, you can go,

1041
00:59:19,231 --> 00:59:22,000
you can get traffic in Orange County
at four o'clock in morning. Literally,

1042
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,180
I'm on another run into traffic.

1043
00:59:23,181 --> 00:59:26,900
So I got here an hour early because I
never know I was in fucking Irvine and I'm

1044
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:31,640
like, oh, I got to go now. Yeah, what?

1045
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:33,860
I texted you, I think it was like
two in the afternoon. I'm like,

1046
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,230
I wonder if that's enough time for him
to get out here. Yeah, seriously. Yeah,

1047
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,880
it's so fucking stupid.

1048
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:41,560
So you go to a place like Reno and
you feel that that nature and you go,

1049
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:43,010
I could live like this though.

1050
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:47,570
Like why would I got fucking
hot girlfriend I got,

1051
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:52,970
she got a cute kid, I got a cute kid
and cost of living is super low and I,

1052
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:57,350
all I need is a nice little all wheel
drive Subaru or something or an Audi and

1053
00:59:57,351 --> 01:00:01,180
just hit that fucking Kingsbury grade
while blah blah blah. Pop Up, pop up,

1054
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:05,240
you know, which you would
you train up there? Yeah,

1055
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:08,120
I would do my training camps down
in, in uh, orange county still.

1056
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,960
But if I could just get away and I
mean there, there is Jim's up there.

1057
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,980
What does their high level gyms?
There's a,

1058
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:20,120
there's a reno or Nevada Moy Moitai, which
is I think the best gym up there. Um,

1059
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:24,410
and they have Charles Gracie Jujitsu. She,
they've got some good black folks. Nice.

1060
01:00:24,411 --> 01:00:27,920
And that's all in Reno. Yeah. And
then when the people live in Reno, uh,

1061
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:29,350
it's getting bigger and it's getting,

1062
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,660
I mean like the food's getting really
good really? And yeah, there's, there's,

1063
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:35,120
and every, you know, my
girlfriend, like I said,

1064
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:37,760
it's kind of the face of the area
and she's always around other hot.

1065
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,830
That's what I get to see it get
to see hot women all the time.

1066
01:00:39,831 --> 01:00:40,970
She runs a promotional company,

1067
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:46,660
so it all makes sense now. I understand.
I want to read, I didn't get it.

1068
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,860
The cat,
the caliber of ask that comes out of her,

1069
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:51,980
even her little town of [inaudible]
is fucking incredible. I'm like, wow,

1070
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:56,660
this place is great. That's interesting
because I think it's biased of course.

1071
01:00:56,661 --> 01:00:59,030
But I think, I've never been
to reno, but I think of Reno,

1072
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,850
I might've been the arena, but I don't
remember it. But I think of Doug,

1073
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:05,720
Stan hope recorded a CD there once because
Doug likes to go to fucked up places

1074
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:09,710
and record things like he, he did
one of them in Oslo, Norway, like,

1075
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:14,660
oh I fuck do that. They barely even
understood what he was saying. He,

1076
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:19,661
but he recorded his first CD and a v Reno
and the voice that's chalked off on a

1077
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:25,060
list of places I don't need to go to
and listen to that CD. I'm like, yeah,

1078
01:01:25,061 --> 01:01:27,970
I don't need to go there. It's changed
very recently where it's becoming cool.

1079
01:01:27,971 --> 01:01:31,640
It's becoming kind of Portland dish,
but minus the fucking Douchey.

1080
01:01:31,641 --> 01:01:34,910
Let's save the world kind of Shit. It's
like, when did that happen? Recently?

1081
01:01:34,911 --> 01:01:39,320
Super recently. I how many years?
Past five years maybe. What caused it?

1082
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,580
People probably realize that
people realize that we're
fucking everything up and

1083
01:01:43,581 --> 01:01:45,890
we're douchebags and everyone's
like, okay. But it's, it's just,

1084
01:01:45,891 --> 01:01:48,530
it's so outdoorsy and it's so,
it's,

1085
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:52,130
it's still got the fucking casinos and
they're just trying to be, become nicer.

1086
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,290
But uh,
there's always something going on.

1087
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,850
There's only other guys I know that lives
in Reno is a, my friend Remy who's a,

1088
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,330
he's, there's a show
called solo hunters. Yeah,

1089
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:06,430
well he goes hunting biopsies of a guide
and he's kind of famous hunter and he

1090
01:02:07,371 --> 01:02:08,120
uh,
they,

1091
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:12,500
he goes by himself and just brings like
these cameras and Gopros and shit and

1092
01:02:12,501 --> 01:02:14,780
films everything and then edits
it all together. It was crazy,

1093
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:17,450
crazy hunts and he goes on,
I want to kill something with a sword.

1094
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:20,040
I cause that is but not

1095
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,770
likely. You're really
good with a sword. Yeah.

1096
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,350
I got a black belt in San Suu when I was
younger. Kung Fu Sensu so I was just,

1097
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:28,430
it was just go with weapons.
He was all like threat strokes in growing,

1098
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,870
growing shit and like I was
just good with a weapons.

1099
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,800
Have you ever like put on the Kendo gear
and done that? No. It looks fun. It is.

1100
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:37,980
What? I'm going to beat the shit out of
each other with pillows on your body.

1101
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,200
Well I think it looks like
you're the of sticks. Yeah. Yeah.

1102
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:45,780
David Lee Roth moved to Japan
and he practices Kendall all day.

1103
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:49,620
He does Kendo every day. Cause he's
David Lee Roth. He said he's a gangster.

1104
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,760
He's fucking awesome. David,
Dave Dude. Fucking high
kickin and shit. Took his dog.

1105
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:56,970
Yeah, it took his dog got on
a fucking plane at like what?

1106
01:02:56,971 --> 01:03:01,140
60 is he 60 moved to fucking Japan.
He's taking Kendo lessons.

1107
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:05,310
It's under some great fucking
Samurai warrior character.

1108
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,870
They tried to do it for five West.
That was one of the ones that we,

1109
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:12,540
they tried to do and apparently the
association is unbelievably strict. Real.

1110
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:15,120
It isn't like, oh we have our Kendo
school. We do what we want. No,

1111
01:03:15,121 --> 01:03:18,290
it's like the hierarchy's very, very
rigid and they were like, no, fuck.

1112
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:18,781
I just want to,

1113
01:03:18,781 --> 01:03:22,600
I want to pick to run at me and just
soon and then just have it slide. Yeah,

1114
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:26,610
that was being in the food. You not want
to pick to run those mother fuckers.

1115
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:29,400
When we were at a to hone
ranch when I was pig hunting,

1116
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,210
they had a skull from this one
really big board that they killed.

1117
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:38,280
It was a 450 pound boar and the fucking
teeth were like two fingers and they

1118
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,450
were sticking out like this.

1119
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:43,350
He's taught us and that they would
tell you that they run by you.

1120
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:48,000
They just run at you and literally tear
at the side of you. With these tusks,

1121
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,470
they use these tusks almost like as
remember those carts as chariots.

1122
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,830
He said those wheels blades, tick it
off of him. That's what the the hogs do.

1123
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:59,040
They run by you and you'll see this
will fuck you up. They will fuck you up.

1124
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,290
Let rethinking my idea.
Yeah. Don't want to,

1125
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:04,410
you don't want to sort of always
best with the rifle. Yeah. Rifles.

1126
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:07,440
The moon bone Arrow is good but are very,

1127
01:04:07,441 --> 01:04:10,830
there's a very small window to get a
board with a bone arrow down with the

1128
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:12,180
fucking spirit. Difficult. Well,

1129
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:16,500
they have difficult a Oregon's to reach
and they also have an incredibly dense

1130
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:18,700
upper body, like their upper body, the,

1131
01:04:18,701 --> 01:04:22,500
the thick skin around their neck and Cape.
It's like,

1132
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:25,710
it literally is like some sort of a
like a shield that they're wearing.

1133
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:30,480
Like we touched a when, when I was in
camp there was a, I killed a female pig,

1134
01:04:30,481 --> 01:04:33,840
but there was a guy that killed a big
boar and they were explaining to me,

1135
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:36,840
this is why like shot placement is
critical when it comes to archery,

1136
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,340
like touch this and it's like a saddle,
like a, like a, like a horse saddle.

1137
01:04:41,341 --> 01:04:42,870
That's what it felt like around the neck.

1138
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:46,080
And because they're constantly cutting
each other up and fucking each other up

1139
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,720
so they have like this thick
meat all around their body.

1140
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,940
Can you do eat that meat or
is that just the shock? Yeah,

1141
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:52,020
I was gonna say it's got to be good.

1142
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:57,000
Well the pork is very good
for especially smoked.

1143
01:04:57,001 --> 01:05:00,290
I smoked a ham and I'm telling you, it's
one of the best things I've ever eaten.

1144
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,580
It was delicious and super healthy,

1145
01:05:02,581 --> 01:05:06,090
much healthier than a pig that you'd be
getting a grocery store because these

1146
01:05:06,091 --> 01:05:08,820
pigs are just eating egg corns
and there they're running around,

1147
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:12,360
they're real muscular. So there it's
like a dense rich, dark protein.

1148
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:15,870
Super good for you, man. Meets
all oxygenated and fucking,

1149
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,470
if you wind up going up to Reno,

1150
01:05:17,471 --> 01:05:19,870
you'll get a lot of elk cause
there's a lot of elk up in Reno.

1151
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:22,480
There's a lot of people that have,
you know, a lot of hunters up there.

1152
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:25,080
I'm sure you can probably
buy it up there too. Yeah,

1153
01:05:25,081 --> 01:05:27,970
I would want to go kill it myself. I
would just go with, with my girlfriends,

1154
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,730
cousins, they fucking,
that's their thing. They, I,

1155
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:34,300
I want them took me fishing over the
winter and out to the rivers. You know,

1156
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:36,640
we just, he's like, yeah,
throw it there and I missed,

1157
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:38,530
don't wanna throw it right there.
And I missed again. He's like,

1158
01:05:38,531 --> 01:05:40,390
give me that through it in
the spot and kind of fish.

1159
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,930
Did he see it or you just know where
the pool was and mean? He's like,

1160
01:05:43,931 --> 01:05:45,160
and we're driving by and he's like,

1161
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:47,880
we're driving from the highway and it's
a hundred feet down to see the ribbon.

1162
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:51,460
He's like, oh, you see the fish coming
up? I'm like, no man, he's driving. Yeah,

1163
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,680
we're driving this train station, the
road bitch. She's like, you see that?

1164
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,610
I don't fucking put your fucking eyes off
the river. I'm like, I don't know man.

1165
01:05:57,611 --> 01:06:00,070
So we went down there and he, he
just, wherever he tells you to put it,

1166
01:06:00,071 --> 01:06:02,560
if you can live,
once you landed in that exact spot,

1167
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:05,620
you pull in a fucking fish and like how
many times have you caught that fish?

1168
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,690
He'll look at it and be like, Eh,
maybe not this one. I don't know.

1169
01:06:08,691 --> 01:06:09,341
And then like he's like,

1170
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:12,520
I've seen fish with Talon marks
on them that I've caught before.

1171
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:16,240
Talon marks from an eagle funnels
up and Rhea. Oh fuck yeah.

1172
01:06:16,241 --> 01:06:18,070
There's a bunch up down in that area.
Wow.

1173
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,610
I've seen like 10 in one
spot and in Tahoe. No Shit.

1174
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,400
My [inaudible] said my grandparents
haven't had spots all over the lake,

1175
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:25,540
but like right on the lake.

1176
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,540
So you just sit in their backyard and the
fucking in the winter especially cause

1177
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:30,760
it's all white, you know, you can
just see these big fucking birds.

1178
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:34,840
I saw my first live eagle last
summer in Alaska. Really credible,

1179
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:37,600
credible Alaska is fucking amazing.
Flew over our boat.

1180
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:41,230
Me and my friend Ari Shaffir. We went up
there fishing and we did a gig up there.

1181
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,800
Fucking had a great time.
But when we're uh,

1182
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:46,300
we're taking the boat to
the spot on the river,

1183
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,600
he's fucking eagle flew over
our head is huge eagle. Just

1184
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:57,040
big ass fucking legs and shit tucked up.
It's not a big fuck you man.

1185
01:06:57,090 --> 01:07:00,880
It's such big birds to fucking snatch
you up and take you home looking for the

1186
01:07:00,881 --> 01:07:03,430
same shit. I'm looking for
trying to steal some salmon.

1187
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:07,150
They're so big and there's so many
of them. You see them up there.

1188
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,620
The people say they're like pigeons.

1189
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,960
Like they think of them as
like pigeons and nuisance bird.

1190
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:16,570
The American Eagle caught dammit. Dammit.
Our national birds of nuisance bird.

1191
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,120
That's a problem too because if it got,

1192
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:23,770
if they got so overpopulated they would
never get so overpopulated in America or

1193
01:07:23,771 --> 01:07:26,740
doubt. I mean Alaska is not really
America, it's kind of America,

1194
01:07:26,741 --> 01:07:27,970
but whatever other Russia.

1195
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:31,180
But if they got down here and the got
that over populated and they started like

1196
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:34,150
stealing cats and shit problem,

1197
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:38,020
like people might be an issue like
the wolves now do in my neighborhood.

1198
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,380
I have a problem with owls.
I don't have a problem with owls,

1199
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:45,010
but you know my problems and our problem.
No, cause they'll fuck up some cats.

1200
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:48,940
Like if you leave your cat outside the
and the owl catches your cat slipping the

1201
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:51,090
little fucking swooped down.
Owls.

1202
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,270
People don't think of owls as being
like vicious predators. They are.

1203
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:58,240
They're ruthless.
Hallberg big owls are big.

1204
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:01,750
I had an album on my back porch is
motherfucker was three feet tall.

1205
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,230
It was like this tall. There's
sitting there. I'm like, God damn.

1206
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:08,980
I didn't know owls with that big
creepy fucker was backwards head.

1207
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,200
What else I want time to next.
There was a four foot,

1208
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:16,040
four and a half foot beating the shit out

1209
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,310
of my sister's dogs here.
This cheese Mac and the shit out of Ge.

1210
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:24,720
Yelping I'm like, I had to go out
there and save my sister's dog. Do it.

1211
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,850
Recognizable fucker. Oh good.
You issued their fucking vicious.

1212
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:32,630
Have you ever seen a video of Kevin
Rose? He's from a, what does that,

1213
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:35,350
what does he from dig from Digg dot.
Kaiser.

1214
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,470
He created dig and his dog was
getting attacked by a raccoon.

1215
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:42,710
So he picked a raccoon up and
they got it on security camera,

1216
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:45,680
picked a raccoon up and threw
it down a flight of stairs.

1217
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,230
But it's pretty fucking gangster.
The way he does it.

1218
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:52,430
He grabs a raccoon bites back to see if
he can find it, see if we could find it.

1219
01:08:52,431 --> 01:08:55,860
He's got it.
And your rabies walk.

1220
01:08:55,861 --> 01:08:59,450
Rabies just loved his dog so he
just fucking did it. You know,

1221
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:03,140
he just had to do it and this is,
you had it.

1222
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:08,510
Oh Shit. That's so the,
he runs up to the Rep.

1223
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:14,470
Isn't that crazy thing. Look at that.

1224
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,750
Thinks leg and twirling fucking balls,
man.

1225
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:20,480
He's got balls do cause he
didn't like try to underhanded.

1226
01:09:20,481 --> 01:09:22,340
He brought it behind his head.

1227
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,770
He fucking hated that raccoon.
That guy's bad ass.

1228
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:30,410
They will fuck your pets
up if you are not careful.

1229
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:33,410
That is wild man that he did that.

1230
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:37,040
Meanwhile the raccoon probably
walked it off like it was nothing.

1231
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:41,030
This is my dog toaster
crying and yelping and pain.

1232
01:09:41,031 --> 01:09:44,690
I discovered a raccoon attack. Him. I do
not occur. It encourage animal violence.

1233
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,440
I want to get the wild animals far away
from us as possible. Toasters. Okay.

1234
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,750
But it has some bite marks.
Look at it.

1235
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:53,240
There's a dog and the
raccoon are going at it, man.

1236
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,460
And he sees that shit and he just runs
up and grabs that motherfucker and whips.

1237
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:02,780
It runs after it. Bad motherfucker.

1238
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:06,170
Kevin Rose is a bad
motherfucker that is gangster,

1239
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:08,690
but it looks like he owns a poodle.
I'm just

1240
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,130
throwing that out there. A little count.
I'm not even sure if he's straight.

1241
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:20,180
I'm not even sure if he's straight.
So you know, whatever, whatever.

1242
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:24,380
He went after that record and after he
threw it, he said, fucking crazy prick.

1243
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,600
That guy's a mad man. I
ticked that raccoon. Turn
them into a hat. Oh done deal.

1244
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:32,180
Stomp on his little head.
And my dad's from Kentucky.

1245
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:36,470
He was hunting since he was like three.
He's eaten everything. He is in the woods.

1246
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:41,420
Oh a million times. Raccoons,
squirrels, snakes, all kinds of shit.

1247
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:46,060
I beaver when I was in Wisconsin and I
don't mean what you think. [inaudible]

1248
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,420
I got a, I had a beaver. Stu,

1249
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:55,280
Steve Rinella a he slow simmered a beaver.
He caught a beaver.

1250
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:58,590
Killed. It turned its mitten.
It's a body and a mittens.

1251
01:10:58,591 --> 01:11:02,450
Saw that on your Instagram. The same
beaver. I ate some of that beaver.

1252
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:07,050
It was really delicious. Yeah. Tasted
good. Tastes like beef. Like, like,

1253
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:10,020
like a beef pot roast. That's
what it tasted like. Man.

1254
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:13,770
I hate I have eaten. No,
no, no. I will eat anything.

1255
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:17,190
Like I will eat anything.
And my dad,

1256
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:21,120
he did eat things that I
will not touch and my mom,

1257
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,610
he thinks like I have
parents that are even worse.

1258
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:27,330
I'm know for reading anything like balloon
in the Philippines and you know, it's,

1259
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:30,480
I mean all kinds of shit doesn't
really, I don't, doesn't bother me.

1260
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:35,590
I refuse to eat what I drink is
holding a turtle blood one time. Yeah,

1261
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,830
it was like a thing for the gym.
Like really? When I fuck Yoka Shin,

1262
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:44,520
they said it's a thing in our
gym first they gave me a curry.

1263
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:48,900
That was so, it was the hottest thing
I've ever eaten and I like spicy food.

1264
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:54,440
It burned from like the moment all you
could feel what all your intestines where

1265
01:11:54,871 --> 01:11:58,020
like it when all the way through my
intestines burning everything and I just

1266
01:11:58,021 --> 01:12:01,050
kept eating it and other guys
reading and they were meditating.

1267
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:04,230
They had towels on their
heads like blocking out the
pain and they're crying and

1268
01:12:04,231 --> 01:12:06,840
stuff and I'm eating it. I'm
just mad. It's fucking hot.

1269
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:10,860
And I just kept eating it
and the instructor turns
to our translator and goes,

1270
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:11,250
ah,

1271
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:14,840
that is some shit in Japanese and the
instruction that Translate Trans People's,

1272
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:16,780
you're very tough.
A lot of people pass out.

1273
01:12:16,781 --> 01:12:20,670
I'd have to go to the emergency room
like a lot of people die. They were like,

1274
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:24,990
what? They have to pump them or they'll
die. It starts burning and I was like,

1275
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:29,130
are you fucking kidding me? And I finished
it. I May 8th of thing. How's your ass?

1276
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,230
Oh my goodness.

1277
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,610
That's a great question. I don't even
think about that. Burned on the way out.

1278
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:42,240
It didn't burn as bad as it did on the
way down. Like it was burning like,

1279
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:45,690
oh this is uncomfortable and not,
Oh shit, I'm in big trouble burning.

1280
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,740
And then the next night we went to this
old school Sushi place in the middle of

1281
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:53,910
Tokyo and they have a thing
where it's like a, a Mug,

1282
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:57,540
like a beer Stein full of turtle books.
Do you have this turtle soup?

1283
01:12:57,541 --> 01:13:00,840
And they put the blood in this thing
and they usually mix with alcohol,

1284
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:01,680
but I don't drink.

1285
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:05,430
So they had to mix it with some kind of
juice and they mix it all up and like

1286
01:13:05,431 --> 01:13:08,460
here you go. And I'm like, all
right. And I drank this whole mug.

1287
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:12,530
It turtle blood man, just chugged
it. Tire Stein of turtle blooded,

1288
01:13:12,531 --> 01:13:15,780
Chug the whole thing. How many
ounces? Like 1216 year mug.

1289
01:13:15,781 --> 01:13:20,400
Like a Beer Stein to like 20 feels
a lot. Like it was a while. Yeah,

1290
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:23,880
it was a lot. And I just chugged it,
man. I was like, all right, here you go.

1291
01:13:23,881 --> 01:13:28,470
And sit it down. So he's like, it actually
wasn't bad. It wasn't that strong.

1292
01:13:28,471 --> 01:13:30,750
So it tasted like whatever.
It looks like an apple juice or something.

1293
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:32,550
It's usually put booze in
there and I won't drink.

1294
01:13:32,551 --> 01:13:36,780
So they had a like apple juice mixed with
the turtle blood and tasted more like

1295
01:13:36,781 --> 01:13:40,380
apple juice. So I just drank the whole
thing. Oh, so it wasn't bad at all then?

1296
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:42,200
It was actually show me,
no I didn't.

1297
01:13:42,201 --> 01:13:44,100
I didn't think the blood
tastes was that strong,

1298
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,770
but I'm sure it would gross out a lot
of people that couldn't get through it.

1299
01:13:46,771 --> 01:13:49,800
I didn't really care. Your mouth was
still burning from the fucking yeah,

1300
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:53,580
from that curry. I didn't tell you
shit man. That was the deal. They put,

1301
01:13:53,581 --> 01:13:55,180
they just hated us
pretty bad on that shit.

1302
01:13:55,930 --> 01:14:00,930
They cut out a lot of it on the show was
because you could only fit so much in

1303
01:14:01,051 --> 01:14:04,050
the TV show. Like when I went to
Gracie, who? Martha in Brazil,

1304
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:07,950
I fought everyone in the room for
three and a half hours, Wah. Okay.

1305
01:14:07,951 --> 01:14:12,410
By the time I was done, I was like that
Gabe written over my face like, and no,

1306
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:15,790
we're dealing, you know, 15 black belts.
It wasn't like how many times did you tap?

1307
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,650
I don't even remember because the
first 45 minutes I'm doing fine.

1308
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,950
And then after that you just bought.

1309
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,500
It just starts giving even out on you
and they don't stop and they're all,

1310
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,740
and then I look around and I realized
that nobody else is fighting but me,

1311
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:33,670
I like, I'm waiting and they're all
waiting on the mat just to face me.

1312
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,600
And so I'm just riding the snake for
three and out. Three and a half hours.

1313
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:42,580
That is some annoying shit when you see
it sitting there waiting to roll with

1314
01:14:42,581 --> 01:14:44,830
you and he's not rolling.
He's waiting for you to get tired.

1315
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:48,280
And then as soon as your turn is up,
the bell rings and then he's like,

1316
01:14:48,281 --> 01:14:51,700
you want to go? And you're like, what are
you been doing for the past 10 minutes?

1317
01:14:51,701 --> 01:14:54,820
Imagine a whole class full of
that guy. And I mean, like I said,

1318
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:58,540
15 black belts and it wasn't, I mean
this is the original Gracie academy.

1319
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:01,090
It wasn't like a bunch of chumps here.
I mean these guys were amazing.

1320
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:01,871
It's good as it gets.

1321
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:04,600
And the next day I came in and they
did the exact same thing to me.

1322
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:08,830
Oh my goodness. I couldn't, I wasn't
moving great by the end of that.

1323
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:13,750
And then I got not food poisoning.
They made me swim out in Ipanema beach.

1324
01:15:13,751 --> 01:15:15,760
They want a shot of me
swimming and they said, okay,

1325
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,220
we want you to swim from here
to here. And I went, all right.

1326
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:23,320
And then that night I got sicker
than I've ever been in my whole life.

1327
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:27,220
The sound guy got sick listening
to me puke. He was like,

1328
01:15:27,221 --> 01:15:29,740
he was holding the mic
going like he got sick.

1329
01:15:29,741 --> 01:15:31,210
He literally got sick listening to you,

1330
01:15:31,211 --> 01:15:35,140
you get sick because I was shitting in
puke and like from the water and your

1331
01:15:35,141 --> 01:15:36,310
mouth,
those fathers,

1332
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:41,380
they had me swim where the
favela runoff goes. Nobody told,

1333
01:15:41,381 --> 01:15:43,600
like the producers
didn't research anything.

1334
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:46,000
They just said swim from there to there
because it would look good. I went,

1335
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:49,660
all right, fine. Well
that's fucking Brazil.

1336
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,000
And I went to go. I went, yeah,

1337
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:54,850
I swam out there and the the
local looks at me and he goes,

1338
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:58,900
you can't swim out there. That's
where the favela runs off. And I went,

1339
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:04,000
ah, and they go, no, no, no, you can't
swim up there. He goes, American, Nah,

1340
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:07,900
you can't swim out there. And I'm like,
Oh shit. That's why I got so sick.

1341
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:09,910
You swam and Favela Shit.

1342
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:14,350
And the next day I had to fight the guy
for the final fight and fight quests.

1343
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:19,440
And I, I remember standing there and I
was so sick that I was sweating. You know,

1344
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:22,180
you're so sick,
you're swaying like you can't stand still.

1345
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:26,470
And I was swinging around and
because they wanted footage to cut,

1346
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:30,590
I fought the guy for 2024 minutes.
Oh my.

1347
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,950
Like it wasn't like a seven, you
know, I was a pro bowl at the time.

1348
01:16:32,951 --> 01:16:36,250
It wasn't a seven minute match.
That is two or three times. So,

1349
01:16:36,251 --> 01:16:40,870
and this guy was like, he was
amazing. Not only was he really good,

1350
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:45,490
I was sicker than a goddamn dog, so it
was just terrible. So that happened a lot.

1351
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,620
Like there are a lot of things, it just
didn't make the cut. There were like,

1352
01:16:47,621 --> 01:16:51,040
that sounds like, oh, that's
the show. It was rough. Man.

1353
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:53,500
That's the problem with having a show.
It's got to be an hour.

1354
01:16:53,501 --> 01:16:55,840
It's got to fit between this time.
Like no,

1355
01:16:55,841 --> 01:16:58,870
it should be fucking hours and hours long.
He should have to watch all of it.

1356
01:16:58,871 --> 01:17:00,130
Yeah.
Just watch what I mean,

1357
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:03,040
that sounds like a lot of entertaining
shit went down a lot of stuff.

1358
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:03,701
I mean it was cool man.

1359
01:17:03,701 --> 01:17:05,500
It was an experience of a
lifetime doing that kind of stuff.

1360
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:08,680
I would have liked to seen those video
of the guy telling you that that's where

1361
01:17:08,681 --> 01:17:11,840
the favela runoff goes.
I was so knowing that you were sick,

1362
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,590
doctor Brazil and I was like, no,
it was when I was, I'd gone back to,

1363
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:20,690
I trained with Nova neon Donna
Brazil. Oh, on that trip. And uh,

1364
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:23,690
I was just down there for vacation.

1365
01:17:23,691 --> 01:17:27,530
I did an m one show and decided to
stay for a few weeks. And uh, yeah,

1366
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:29,930
I went back to that beach
and a local set. No, no,

1367
01:17:29,931 --> 01:17:34,310
you can't swim out there
and shit. Water. Like fuck.

1368
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:39,290
They missed that. I got so God damn
sick. It was horrible. Yeah. That's not

1369
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,990
in, yeah, probably. I was in the
emergency room in Rio and I can't,

1370
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:49,100
I was lying on the floor cause I couldn't
sit up and a doctor came by and said,

1371
01:17:49,101 --> 01:17:53,150
get him in a room right now and
I'm in an emergency room in Rio.

1372
01:17:53,151 --> 01:17:55,820
So it wasn't like, you know, I'm
out in the middle of nowhere.

1373
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:57,770
Like this is it packed
emergency room in a major city.

1374
01:17:57,771 --> 01:18:00,560
And they went get him an emergency
room right now. Get him in a room,

1375
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:05,210
getting my next day, the next day.
God Damn. Oh God. It was all it was.

1376
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:10,200
I felt like ass, you should have
just shit all over. What I did,

1377
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:15,140
I kept my cabby bubble buttle
clenched up and kept rolling,

1378
01:18:15,141 --> 01:18:18,920
man. You know, that sounded like it
was a fun show to do though. It was,

1379
01:18:18,921 --> 01:18:22,460
it was a blast to do. It really
was. It really was. It was, um,

1380
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:27,940
it was just the disconnect between
the,

1381
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,700
the people who made the show, the
producers and everything weren't fighters.

1382
01:18:30,701 --> 01:18:34,120
They weren't martial arts
didn't understand anything.
And, and right, so Doug got,

1383
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:38,920
when are we doing Kilcoyne in Japan.
He got concussed so badly. He didn't,

1384
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:40,930
he couldn't see out of his eye.

1385
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,510
He had a hemorrhage behind his eye and
he couldn't see out of it. And, and they,

1386
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:47,650
they would go to me and go, well, what
do you think's wrong with Doug? And I go,

1387
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:50,440
I'm not a medical professional.
I can't, you know,

1388
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:55,240
his knee was like grapefruit sized or
like a melon sized. And they were like,

1389
01:18:55,241 --> 01:18:58,090
what's wrong with him? And
I go, I, I'm not Dr. Smith.

1390
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,820
I go there like nine things that could
be wrong and to create those symptoms.

1391
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,770
He needs an MRI. And they
went, oh, he'll be all right.

1392
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:05,640
And he fought like they didn't,
this wasn't,

1393
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:08,650
they weren't staff reginae
they could've been anything,

1394
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:11,740
but they did these warrants
sanctioned athletic events.

1395
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:15,280
So they didn't test.
If we were,

1396
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:19,380
if we could get out there and
fight, we fought, that is up.

1397
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:23,410
They just didn't have any, that's the
problem with reality to is there's no,

1398
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:28,300
you know, I remember, you know, a pretty,
she doesn't know like is that safe?

1399
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:29,463
They don't know.

1400
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:32,920
We shot on the edge of the volcano one
time and there are all these signs going,

1401
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:35,260
like there's, there was, there was a, uh,

1402
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:38,680
like a guard rail to keep it from going
out with this poisonous gas. Well,

1403
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:40,240
the camera guy goes,

1404
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:43,690
I'd be great shot if we got out
there and this is in Indonesia.

1405
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:48,250
And he just turns to the, the guy,
the ranger and says, can we just go,

1406
01:19:48,251 --> 01:19:50,050
we're just gonna go right out there.
Just is that cool?

1407
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:53,320
And the guy just kind of threw his hands
up on, yeah, go ahead. And he goes,

1408
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:55,510
and then, so we went out there and he
goes, all right, well how about that one?

1409
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:58,000
And so we did the shot and
I turned around and we are

1410
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:04,710
60 yards behind. Do Not Cross poisonous
gas. Don't go over this slide.

1411
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:05,641
And the camera guy,

1412
01:20:05,641 --> 01:20:08,820
it's about talk to his dude into
letting us get all the way out there.

1413
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:13,260
And the guy starts talking and our
trans or turns to us and goes, yeah,

1414
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:16,800
there are rivers of poisonous gas around
where you're shooting if you fall,

1415
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:18,900
that's it for you basically.

1416
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:22,230
And I'm like doing stuff on the top of
this mountain. And they're like, yeah,

1417
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:24,980
if you follow that, that's it for you.
And the producers don't give a fuck.

1418
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:29,520
They do not. It's good for the show. God
Damn it. Get your ass out there and do it.

1419
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:31,080
That's the attitude of reality TV.

1420
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,790
So it was this combination of
fighting and reality TV. So it was,

1421
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:40,380
it was interesting because they don't
know that. And I had to go, hey,

1422
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:45,180
Doug needs a concussion check. And they
went, well, how do I go? Or I said,

1423
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:49,110
we need concussion checks after we
fought five guys in the CALC isn't final.

1424
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:52,170
I said, we need concussion checks. And
they said, well, how do you know? I said,

1425
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:57,150
listen to me, I just fought
five guys in a row. I, you know,

1426
01:20:57,151 --> 01:20:59,940
I'm telling you we need to get checked
out to make sure we don't have a

1427
01:20:59,941 --> 01:21:03,420
concussion. And they're like
fighting me on it. And I went, look,

1428
01:21:03,421 --> 01:21:05,160
we need to go to the restroom when
we need get concussion checks.

1429
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:08,330
We both got kicked in the head, they
were fighting, you'll fine. But I,

1430
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,860
the whole point is I shouldn't
know the difference. You know,

1431
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:13,090
if a guy's telling you doesn't he
concussion check, it needs to concussion.

1432
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:16,800
So they went and they took us there and
Doug blew his nose because of blood in

1433
01:21:16,801 --> 01:21:19,770
his nose and his cheek starts
blowing up like a balloon.

1434
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,800
He had cracked or orbital bone and so
air was getting out through his cheek and

1435
01:21:25,591 --> 01:21:28,110
so he goes, is there something
wrong in my cheek? And I hit it.

1436
01:21:28,111 --> 01:21:32,650
I pushed it and it was going like a
rice krispies cause there was air, air,

1437
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:36,420
air bubbles in there. And I went, I think
you cracked your own little Barb wrote.

1438
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:37,560
It's like, Ah Shit. Okay.

1439
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:40,510
And then we fought again in like 10 days
were in another country, the same shit.

1440
01:21:40,511 --> 01:21:42,420
It's taught again with a broken orbital.

1441
01:21:42,421 --> 01:21:44,950
Two days later we had 10 days
between shoots. That's exactly.

1442
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:50,010
So that's when we started the
next one down. Tough fuck man.

1443
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:52,410
I was just our lives man.
How old were you then?

1444
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:56,310
I turned 30 during the show,
so I was 29 for most of it.

1445
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:59,070
So you were young enough to be talked
into something really fucking stupid.

1446
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:03,960
But I also, but also like
defensively, like the pro Doug
really got beat on my, my,

1447
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:08,430
my cohost on the show because
I have fought professionally
when I'm in deep shit

1448
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:12,630
in the show, I would put my hands up
and move my head and, and you know,

1449
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:15,390
I've been around the block enough to
know that when I was outgunned I was

1450
01:22:15,391 --> 01:22:18,300
fighting a heavyweight.
Okay. If I can cover up,

1451
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,670
cover up and not get
hurt straight defense,

1452
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,730
he had no idea how to do that
and would just get hammered.

1453
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:27,210
When I was living with his background,
none, he was a, he was a military guy.

1454
01:22:27,211 --> 01:22:29,210
He had been,
he had been in Iraq and,

1455
01:22:29,211 --> 01:22:33,120
and had been a bodyguard in Iraq
and had done some amateur fights.

1456
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:35,730
So he just didn't have the
wherewithal to go, you don't,

1457
01:22:35,731 --> 01:22:37,140
when you're fighting six guys,

1458
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,210
I'm going to make it look
good for three of those guys.

1459
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:41,770
And then for the rest I'm slipping
and moving and you know, I'm,

1460
01:22:41,771 --> 01:22:45,570
I'm working on my, using my defensive
skills. He didn't have that skill set.

1461
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,550
So when the water got too deep,

1462
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:52,050
he would just get hammered and hammered
and I'd have to talk to producers and go,

1463
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:57,030
you can't. One time we were in
Indonesian and he's a real jovial guys,

1464
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:58,460
a lot like use those jokers,

1465
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:01,890
smaller guys who he's funny
and he was just depressed,

1466
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:06,280
like to the point of like he wasn't
the same dude and the producers went,

1467
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:07,690
what's wrong with Doug?
And I said,

1468
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:11,710
he's getting beaten up every fucking week.

1469
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:15,970
You can't put him through this
physically and mentally every week.

1470
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:19,720
Like these starting to break
down and we're, I'm like,
week six, whatever it was.

1471
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:23,590
I go, he you, you can't, it's like at
the gym, like when you get hazed. Yeah,

1472
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:26,980
that's fine.
If you hate the guy every day for a month,

1473
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:30,550
he starts just fallen apart or you,
you can't,

1474
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:32,800
I mean every good coach
knows that like you put,

1475
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:34,630
you go with guys or higher level,

1476
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:36,280
but there are certain point
you don't give him those,

1477
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,370
give them those times where he's feeling
good and if you don't have those,

1478
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:42,310
you start breaking down.
And Doug started just breaking down.

1479
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,233
Well there's also right,

1480
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:47,260
your whole system gets fucked
up cause of head trauma bad.

1481
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,710
That's what they're finding now
and out mad about head trauma.

1482
01:23:50,711 --> 01:23:53,950
Head trauma to a tear gland just doesn't
produce the chemicals needs when it

1483
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:57,670
gets smashed by a Shin kick,
it just doesn't work.

1484
01:23:57,671 --> 01:24:01,630
The ranch is the big argument about this
TRT shit cause they're saying if these

1485
01:24:01,631 --> 01:24:05,800
guys need TRT thing wrong cause they're
getting kicked in the head all the time,

1486
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:08,920
it's either that or steroids or
there's a medical issue on top of that.

1487
01:24:08,921 --> 01:24:13,480
So how many people have that
medical issue? It's a small
percentage. Most of them.

1488
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:16,840
Hypo Gandy, isn't it? Yeah.
Going at a homeowner, either.

1489
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:20,500
Most of them see their steroid abuse or
they've getting hit in the head too much

1490
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:22,920
or weight cutting. Weight
cutting is a big one too. I had,

1491
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:24,310
I had a doctor telling me,
he goes,

1492
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:29,200
no functioning athlete should
need TRT. He's like, if,

1493
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:34,000
if you need TRT, something's wrong. You've
been, your endocrine system is screwed.

1494
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:37,150
There's something that's happened
to fuck you up. Uh, apply. Matt,

1495
01:24:37,151 --> 01:24:40,990
you shouldn't be thinking
about TRT therapy until
you're like 45 50 until you're

1496
01:24:40,991 --> 01:24:43,810
literally not, you know, I'm not preaching
of Sergeant, I'm getting too old.

1497
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:46,270
It's like a prime athletes
shouldn't have that on.

1498
01:24:46,271 --> 01:24:48,120
The only doctors I've talked to
you have given me, they said,

1499
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,430
shouldn't happen if you're that
age unless something's wrong. Yeah.

1500
01:24:51,431 --> 01:24:56,000
There were guys in the UFC
that had in their 20s yeah.

1501
01:24:57,830 --> 01:25:02,800
What, what? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Maybe
like Antonio Silva because he's got,

1502
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:07,910
he's a very extreme example. This
is a special case period. Yeah.

1503
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:13,260
It makes sense that he would
need it. But you know, it's,

1504
01:25:13,290 --> 01:25:14,080
it's a fucking,

1505
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:18,250
it's just such a crazy situation because
they let it through for a while. Yeah.

1506
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,590
You know, so we've got, Oh God,

1507
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:24,340
the guy like Chael Sonnen is kind of
like the canary in a coal mine and he's

1508
01:25:24,341 --> 01:25:26,920
kind of like one of the
first guys you know,

1509
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,220
and had the issue after the
Anderson Silva fight, we said,

1510
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:34,600
they said it was clear but it wasn't
cleared and almost won the title and then

1511
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:39,220
was suspended for a long time and then
came back and then failed that test and

1512
01:25:39,221 --> 01:25:42,790
then failed this new test. And so,
but the problem with this new test,

1513
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:44,810
okay,

1514
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:49,810
if the last test he had that obviously
was things to deal with the TRT therapy,

1515
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:57,390
what I've read and the argument is going
to be how does this affect his legacy

1516
01:25:57,391 --> 01:25:59,480
and that he had in that,

1517
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:00,600
okay,

1518
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,090
did he retire because he knew he
had pissed off of this other test.

1519
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,130
Didn't want that,
but come on

1520
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,850
public and you know,
it just raises all these questions about,

1521
01:26:07,851 --> 01:26:11,090
well he's on all this other stuff.
He knew he took the test already.

1522
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:13,700
The one in Oregon was he retiring because,
oh man,

1523
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:17,860
I pissed off for this one to you and
try and get out. I mean it just castle,

1524
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:22,280
there's a serious doubt on his,
his legacy. When you throw him the,

1525
01:26:22,281 --> 01:26:25,250
the new tests it got announced
today. That's huge. Okay.

1526
01:26:25,251 --> 01:26:29,390
But do you could question
vandelays legacy? Uh,

1527
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:33,380
a little bit. I mean, we're all sitting
here talking about when Vandelay was at,

1528
01:26:33,381 --> 01:26:36,670
his best motherfucker was
juiced beyond. Oh, and we're,

1529
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,780
we're sitting here talking about man,
when Vandelay was at his best,

1530
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:44,510
he was a walking pharmacy. We're
assuming that, but that's legacy.

1531
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,250
When you see Vandelay Silva,
Joe,

1532
01:26:46,251 --> 01:26:49,550
what do you think of this roided
out beast killing people in prime.

1533
01:26:49,551 --> 01:26:53,420
Different time. Different time. But
it's still what we're thinking about.

1534
01:26:53,421 --> 01:26:54,500
It's still in our head.

1535
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:58,820
It's still part of the conversation we
just had about a prime mentally involved

1536
01:26:58,821 --> 01:27:03,680
pharmaceutical products. That's legacy.
Yeah. You got to knowledge. It is,

1537
01:27:03,681 --> 01:27:07,590
it's what you talk about. It's still my
favorite. Yeah, exactly what it, man,

1538
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:12,470
I'm put my bitch Vandelay fan till the
day I die. I love the guy to death.

1539
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:14,750
But like I said, when you say
legacy, yeah. You're thinking,

1540
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:17,810
what do I think of when I think of
that? No, absolutely. It's true.

1541
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:22,620
I mean, look, it's something that
has to be considered. And with jail,

1542
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:27,990
you know, there's more than one situation,
more, more than one instance of it.

1543
01:27:27,991 --> 01:27:30,510
So it's, you know, it's, it's,
it's a part of his legacy,

1544
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:35,340
but I think Chels legacy ultimately is
going to be more of a self promoter then

1545
01:27:35,341 --> 01:27:39,150
even if a fighter, I mean, he's, I think
he's the best shit talker ever by far.

1546
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:44,070
His mouth, his bronze.
Fucking, he's the greatest.

1547
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,880
I love his shit. Talking
and it made him, I mean,

1548
01:27:47,881 --> 01:27:51,120
you think about he has a victory
over shogun. Huge victory submission.

1549
01:27:51,121 --> 01:27:53,670
When the Anderson fight,
the first one,

1550
01:27:53,671 --> 01:27:56,400
very close fight gets submitted
in the final round. I mean,

1551
01:27:56,401 --> 01:27:58,050
there's a lot of good
moments in his career

1552
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:00,020
leading up to the Anderson Silva fight.

1553
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:04,290
I remember he'd beaten Nate Marquardt
was a great fight, great fight. Uh,

1554
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:08,730
he'd beaten, I want to see,
you should know comedy before
that. Yeah, he'd be, yeah.

1555
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,650
Decisions. I mean, you
know, had he, he'd be,

1556
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,310
I remember not thinking he had much
of a shot. I remember thinking, oh,

1557
01:28:16,311 --> 01:28:19,270
those are good ones. Good solid
guys. But they weren't blowouts.

1558
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:23,510
He didn't destroy those guys.
They were decisioned wins his mouth.

1559
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,470
Sold that fight.
Yeah.

1560
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:30,050
I don't remember a lot of people thinking
before he started talking that he had

1561
01:28:30,051 --> 01:28:32,300
a great shot.
His mouth made that fight.

1562
01:28:32,301 --> 01:28:36,070
I've heard from more than one person that
they were worried that Anderson Silva,

1563
01:28:36,071 --> 01:28:39,080
cause remember he had fought tail
slate, this, this goofy, weird fight.

1564
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,520
The Damien Maia fight.

1565
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:45,940
Weird kind of fight that Dana was
furious and Anderson Silva and they were

1566
01:28:46,641 --> 01:28:50,200
worried about him putting his fight like
on an undercard who's was threatening

1567
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:53,510
put on a car. I don't know how real
that is, but chill went fuck it.

1568
01:28:53,511 --> 01:28:56,150
I gotta sell this thing.
And that's when the mouth came out.

1569
01:28:56,151 --> 01:28:58,140
Cause he hadn't really done that before.
Yeah,

1570
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:02,190
it was through that fight that
all came out. And his teammate,

1571
01:29:02,191 --> 01:29:04,140
one of his teammates or his
old coach told me, he goes,

1572
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:07,950
they were worried Anderson Silva vs shale
was going to be on an undercard cause

1573
01:29:07,951 --> 01:29:10,590
there's other performances have been so
weird that they were going to kind of

1574
01:29:10,591 --> 01:29:12,570
punish him. So that shale went, fuck,

1575
01:29:12,571 --> 01:29:16,410
I got to sell this thing and just started
running his mouth off and made a fight.

1576
01:29:16,411 --> 01:29:21,060
That on paper I don't think was super
compelling into like must see TV.

1577
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:23,910
And then it became, and then
it became a thing. You can,

1578
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:27,120
the problem with the character,
and I tell this to fighters all the time,

1579
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:31,290
if it's not you, be
careful. It becomes you.

1580
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:36,120
If it's not you, if you
aren't comfortable, may
him. Miller became a dude.

1581
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:39,840
Mayhem became a person and you to
be a nickname when I first met him.

1582
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:43,080
Now it's a guy,
it's an amalgam I gotta be.

1583
01:29:43,081 --> 01:29:45,180
And it's like if you aren't
comfortable being that guy,

1584
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:48,300
please don't start because
you can't just stop.

1585
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:53,250
Imagine not wanting to be Hulk Hogan.
And when people come up and go,

1586
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:57,440
hey, you have to be hokey. He can't be
whatever his name is newer right now.

1587
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:03,450
You can't not feed that back. I can't not
be that guy, so I tell fight. I was like,

1588
01:30:03,451 --> 01:30:07,230
Oh, be careful with that
shit. That's once you start,

1589
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:09,690
you cannot stop.
Ultimate warrior died.

1590
01:30:09,691 --> 01:30:14,430
The ultimate [inaudible]
in his mom's basement.

1591
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:19,570
[inaudible]

1592
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,120
seriously, can't just turn it off that
aren't, she can't go, you know what?

1593
01:30:24,121 --> 01:30:25,230
I'm really sick of this stick.

1594
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:29,820
These kids got to be that
guy or else don't start.

1595
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:35,150
Don't create a character to to hyper fight
and for the rest of your life you are

1596
01:30:35,611 --> 01:30:39,390
a whole Cogan or you're the ultimate
warrior or you're some character you don't

1597
01:30:39,391 --> 01:30:42,990
believe in because it won't go away.
That is hilarious.

1598
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:47,490
We'll talk to you and be disappointed
that man, you're pretty normal. I'm just,

1599
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,490
one of the things that that really
I really liked is that people, fans,

1600
01:30:50,491 --> 01:30:52,710
a Fike was met me and went,
wow, you're not that different.

1601
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:54,120
Like you're not any different.

1602
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:58,170
Like the show is just you doing stuff.

1603
01:30:58,171 --> 01:31:00,830
People who see my commentary and
meet me in real life go, well,

1604
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:02,580
you're not any different really.

1605
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:06,600
I don't have to create a guy that I have
to be when people come up and I've got

1606
01:31:06,601 --> 01:31:09,000
to be fight question me.
Like I don't have to be that guy.

1607
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:13,290
Bobcat Goldthwait struggled with that
forever. Bobcat for the longest time,

1608
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:14,740
you know, he, his comedy act,

1609
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:20,690
who would do that?
Like he would delivery it

1610
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:25,440
and then after a while,
I mean it was hilarious,

1611
01:31:25,441 --> 01:31:28,230
but after a while he got tired
of fucking doing that. He, his,

1612
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:32,010
he had a great comedy DVD called
is he liked that all the time.

1613
01:31:32,011 --> 01:31:35,430
Do you remember that? Bobcat Goldthwait
is, he liked that all the time.

1614
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:38,940
And he's a really, really
smart guy with, you know,

1615
01:31:38,941 --> 01:31:41,820
insightful things to say about stuff.
But

1616
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:46,320
I don't think he does that at all
anymore though. Now he's just,

1617
01:31:46,321 --> 01:31:48,620
he's allowed to be himself
now, but people, it took,

1618
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:52,170
there was a transitionary period after
he's been on the podcast for, he's great.

1619
01:31:52,171 --> 01:31:56,580
I love him. He made a big foot movie,
man. Really? Yeah, a horror movie.

1620
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:59,980
It's good. Let's coming out
soon. We're going to have a,

1621
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:04,680
um, some sort of a release party. I'm in
where we you want to go? Shit. Alright.

1622
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:05,683
Bobcat

1623
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:11,690
Ian and I were in bravo be a screening
somewhere. I'll let you guys know when it,

1624
01:32:11,691 --> 01:32:14,540
when it takes place. But uh, Bob,
I seen, I've seen it already.

1625
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:17,630
It's really fucking good.
He had a really good big foot movie.

1626
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:22,000
It's called Willow Creek. That is not easy
to pull off to a really good big Gary.

1627
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:26,990
It got 93 on rotten tomatoes, Asca,
93 fucking percent on rotten tomatoes.

1628
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:31,850
That's huge. Or I am db one
of those things, whatever
it is. But it's, it's good.

1629
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,460
It's like a Blair witch style filming.

1630
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:39,620
Like these people that went out looking
to make a film about a big foot and then

1631
01:32:39,621 --> 01:32:40,191
they,
you know,

1632
01:32:40,191 --> 01:32:43,340
they pieced together this documentary
based on their unedited footage.

1633
01:32:43,730 --> 01:32:47,780
It's fucking good. That's crazy. Yeah.
Bob, he's a big believer in big fun man.

1634
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:50,230
I wish big. It was real. I
show two. That'd be so awesome.

1635
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:52,190
I have a theory that if he's real,
he has to be gay.

1636
01:32:52,191 --> 01:32:53,210
That's why there's only 10 of them.

1637
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:57,470
Otherwise they'd be everywhere because no
one's eating big foot babies. Who's he?

1638
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:58,790
Who's keeping them from bring days?

1639
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:02,210
Wait too much logic for most people
because most people when you start talking

1640
01:33:02,211 --> 01:33:04,430
about you don't, you need a
breeding population of something.

1641
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:06,500
They look at you with this
blank stare and you go,

1642
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:10,160
there has to be enough of them to
have genetic variety and have babies.

1643
01:33:10,161 --> 01:33:14,420
This makes sense to anybody.
There's not one big foot one. Oh,

1644
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:16,680
you course you can find,
but you can cut me in population.

1645
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:20,390
Who's then the Pacific northwest. It's so
vast, so it could be thousands of them.

1646
01:33:20,391 --> 01:33:24,470
I believe there's about 10,000 Sasquatch
in North America approximately.

1647
01:33:24,830 --> 01:33:28,030
When I did that show for Psi Phi
Joe Rogan questions, everything.

1648
01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:30,050
I talked to all those
fucking goof balls too.

1649
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:33,410
I talked to those people in depth
for hours. I went squashing.

1650
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:36,230
I went out in the woods with those
people for days poking around,

1651
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:40,820
just poking around, looking at animals.
There's a lot of shit out there.

1652
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:42,460
There's a lot of weird shit
out there like you, you know,

1653
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:43,880
there's things you'll never see.

1654
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:46,730
Like you could live the rest of your
life and never see them outlined or live

1655
01:33:46,731 --> 01:33:49,460
the rest of your life and never see a
wolverine. And we know that they're real.

1656
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:51,020
So in their logic they like,

1657
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:54,500
but there are people who are very
credible witnesses who told him,

1658
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,770
here's a problem. And I went bear
hunting recently and when I was hunting,

1659
01:33:57,860 --> 01:34:01,100
I saw a squirrel for half a second.
I thought that squirrel was a wolf

1660
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:08,380
half of one second. It's like, hello,
it's a fucking squirrel. You asshole.

1661
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:14,240
That highlights, you know,
fairly good light. You know,

1662
01:34:14,241 --> 01:34:18,910
it was towards the, you are and
you've been in. Yeah, I'm hunting.

1663
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:23,570
I got a fucking boat.
I'm there for the full experience.

1664
01:34:23,571 --> 01:34:25,520
And I thought a squirrel was a wolf.

1665
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:31,270
It was only for a half a second.
But it happened. I really,

1666
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:35,930
I was like, fuck no, it's not
a fucking wolf. You, that's
all it was that much time.

1667
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:40,640
But Oh, that's awesome. That's what
happens, man. You see a bear. Okay.

1668
01:34:40,641 --> 01:34:43,970
And you see a bear standing up on
on its back feet, which they do.

1669
01:34:43,971 --> 01:34:46,400
I've seen bears do it.
They stand up on their back feet.

1670
01:34:46,401 --> 01:34:48,140
It's weird to see because
they're big as fuck.

1671
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:51,860
When you see a seven foot
tall bear standing up and
his back feet and he's near

1672
01:34:51,861 --> 01:34:56,780
a tree and if you see that from really
far away and if you're in the woods,

1673
01:34:56,781 --> 01:35:00,740
the also is, you're not seeing,
it's not like it's in a field.

1674
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:05,630
You're seeing it in between trees so
you're not getting a good view of it.

1675
01:35:05,631 --> 01:35:07,600
You're getting a view of it from what a,

1676
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:10,880
even if it's in the Pacific
northwest especially, it's so dense.

1677
01:35:11,110 --> 01:35:12,830
If it's 20 yards away from you,

1678
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:16,130
you're looking at a sliver
of it through a dozen trees.

1679
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:19,410
It least probably more like a hundred
tree is depth. Perception is just fuck,

1680
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,000
fuck the perceptions.
Fuck what you're looking at as fuck.

1681
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:26,810
And then if you convince yourself that
it was a guy standing up that was like

1682
01:35:26,811 --> 01:35:29,660
black and covered with hair, you're
like, oh my God, I saw big foot.

1683
01:35:29,661 --> 01:35:32,930
And then you start painting it in your,
your head that it was big foot.

1684
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,690
It's a bear. You dumb
fuck. It's a black bear.

1685
01:35:35,691 --> 01:35:38,600
A big tall black bear that was
scratching his back on a tree.

1686
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:42,050
Or we saw them rubbing their
pussies on trees. The females,

1687
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,560
they back their pussy up to trees and
they start rubbing their pussies on church

1688
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:49,130
working that they get their ass, they
get horny and they start freaking out.

1689
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:51,590
You guys, he got it. Got
to just find a way. Well,

1690
01:35:51,591 --> 01:35:53,570
my favorite is there's nothing
like that in the fossil record.

1691
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,150
And they look at you with another blank
stare. Like, Hey, you know, we've,

1692
01:35:56,151 --> 01:35:58,520
we've found every creature
that's in the woods now,

1693
01:35:59,510 --> 01:36:01,610
millions of years of
versions of those creatures.

1694
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:07,340
We've never seen anything like a big
foot. That's where you're wrong. Yeah.

1695
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:11,780
Yeah. But it is so incredible.
Have you seen one of those things?

1696
01:36:12,110 --> 01:36:16,770
It is unbelievably gigantic. There's
no transitional. I've, I've heard that,

1697
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:17,720
that same theory.

1698
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:22,010
There's no transitional species that
they found like to go from there to

1699
01:36:22,011 --> 01:36:26,680
anything big foot size. There's no
rugby that big. See the thing about

1700
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:27,570
gigantic pithy goes,

1701
01:36:27,571 --> 01:36:31,410
it's really fascinating is they didn't
even know it existed until the 1920 some

1702
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:34,620
guy, was it an apothecary
shop and China and they found,

1703
01:36:35,430 --> 01:36:38,960
they found it too unknown primate to
try to figure out what it was asked.

1704
01:36:38,961 --> 01:36:41,250
The guy where'd you get this?
They take them to this place,

1705
01:36:41,251 --> 01:36:45,000
they find more bones and they find a job
bone that seems to indicate a bipedal

1706
01:36:45,001 --> 01:36:48,360
hominid because of the position of
the jaw bone with the animals that are

1707
01:36:48,361 --> 01:36:49,440
walking on all fours.

1708
01:36:49,441 --> 01:36:52,350
Their jaws positioned differently
than someone standing straight up.

1709
01:36:52,590 --> 01:36:55,740
So but based on jaw bones
and a couple of other pieces,

1710
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:59,340
they put together this enormous primate
that they think is between eight and 10

1711
01:36:59,341 --> 01:37:01,500
feet tall,
which is what a lot of people say.

1712
01:37:01,501 --> 01:37:03,300
The big foot is between
eight and 10 feet tall.

1713
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:08,630
The other thing that's weird is that the
gigantic pikas existed as recently as a

1714
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:11,340
hundred thousand years ago,
documented and lived in Asia,

1715
01:37:11,341 --> 01:37:15,700
which is exactly where the Bering strait
connected to the North American land

1716
01:37:15,701 --> 01:37:17,400
mass before the last ice age.

1717
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:22,640
So if something did walk cross during
the Ice Age and followed people,

1718
01:37:22,681 --> 01:37:23,820
which is what they think happened,

1719
01:37:23,821 --> 01:37:26,310
that people walked across that
and came to North America.

1720
01:37:26,311 --> 01:37:29,790
That's why when they test native
Americans, they test their DNA.

1721
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:32,580
They find that a lot of them are
related to people from Siberia.

1722
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,430
We just kind of fascinating.
So the animal,

1723
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:40,140
if it did exist at the time and did camp,
they don't know if existed, you know,

1724
01:37:40,141 --> 01:37:43,110
15, 20,000 years ago, they know
existed a hundred thousand years ago.

1725
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:44,790
That's a long,
long gap.

1726
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:48,420
But if that thing did come and
lived in the Pacific northwest,

1727
01:37:48,421 --> 01:37:50,790
the idea is that a small amount
of them would still be there.

1728
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:54,050
There is a thing in Siberia
they call them almost,

1729
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,620
that's their word for the wild man,
uh,

1730
01:37:56,670 --> 01:38:01,670
that are like either big
neanderthal or small.

1731
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:03,473
Uh,

1732
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:08,610
I can never say the word [inaudible]
again to a pitch again to pick is um, the,

1733
01:38:08,611 --> 01:38:13,230
so the Russians had their own kind of
big foot called an Alma and in the mid 18

1734
01:38:13,231 --> 01:38:13,591
hundreds,

1735
01:38:13,591 --> 01:38:18,120
there's a story of a one called Zona
that they had captured and some crazy

1736
01:38:18,121 --> 01:38:23,121
fucker has sex with it and they produced
half Alma kids and their descendants

1737
01:38:24,251 --> 01:38:28,140
are still live in this village
and in the steps of Russia. Yeah.

1738
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:30,180
So like stories out there,

1739
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:33,300
totally likely stories out there
probably definitely happened.

1740
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:35,810
I'd fuck big from the end of
towels were short. It's fuck,

1741
01:38:35,811 --> 01:38:40,170
neanderthals were short and strong
as shit. Five feet tall, 200 pounds.

1742
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:43,740
Dance as fuck. Yeah, they were
weird. Bill, break your shit.

1743
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:47,010
They were built way more like a
gorilla than they were like a person.

1744
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:49,320
They like Wade dense thick muscles.

1745
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:52,410
And it's interesting that we don't know
what they really looked like either.

1746
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:54,630
We have these ideas that they make,
you know,

1747
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:56,580
we don't know what the
color their skin was.

1748
01:38:57,030 --> 01:39:01,200
It's just total speculation as to
what color their skin was. You know,

1749
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:02,280
we don't know what they looked like.

1750
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:05,430
They could've looked way more
like some sort of an ape. Yeah,

1751
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:08,130
we do know that they fucked people
though and that people fuck them.

1752
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,350
We noticed there was a
whole lot fucking going on.

1753
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:14,430
Cro-Magnon either push them out or
interbred with them. They're competing.

1754
01:39:14,431 --> 01:39:17,160
Fucked him to extinction. Fucked
them into extinction. Man.

1755
01:39:17,161 --> 01:39:21,270
Took all those crazy freak neanderthal
bitches and fuck the shit out of him.

1756
01:39:21,271 --> 01:39:26,150
Killed their husbands and that's a good,
have a good set of genocide, right? Yup.

1757
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:27,680
Just fucking and killing everything.

1758
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:30,540
It is interesting because they think
now they're starting to think that

1759
01:39:30,541 --> 01:39:33,060
neanderthals were way smarter than we
thought they were because their brains are

1760
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:35,280
actually larger than,
than Homo sapiens.

1761
01:39:35,790 --> 01:39:38,550
And they thought that those brains that
were larger was to compensate for the

1762
01:39:38,551 --> 01:39:42,510
extra muscle mass and all the different
functions that their body was able to

1763
01:39:42,511 --> 01:39:46,240
perform that ours warrant because they
were way stronger than people. Yeah.

1764
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:49,950
Then like they would, if we had a
neanderthal that was fighting in the UFC,

1765
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:55,140
he would make who somal par
Horez look like Brad Pickett.

1766
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:58,120
Teach me mean fucking leg left
leg locks and set it out there.

1767
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:01,950
Keep imagine what those
fucking things would look like.

1768
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:06,960
Just thick fucking five foot
tall, 200 pounds. Dense ass,

1769
01:40:06,961 --> 01:40:11,430
thick bones, giant elbows and
shit. Fuck you up. Extra long arms,

1770
01:40:11,431 --> 01:40:15,900
short legs where you've got to punch
it just catches you and pulls you in.

1771
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:22,390
Our design. Suck so hard. The
JobOne of the modern human,

1772
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:25,890
you know, you see guys get right like
Schilling and mark, Simon Marcus,

1773
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:30,990
perfect shot on the job. Prank shuts
everything off. Not the or. Nope.

1774
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:32,520
It's like punching a forehead.

1775
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:36,060
Part of the reason part of me isn't there
at their heads were shaped differently

1776
01:40:36,061 --> 01:40:39,780
is they had extra attachments here.
Dope for muscles.

1777
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,600
Also for buying raw meat.
She's chewing through.

1778
01:40:42,601 --> 01:40:46,170
Fucking would hide when they
didn't have time to advent knives.

1779
01:40:46,171 --> 01:40:51,171
Just fucking chewing through a fucking
woolly mammoths face trying to fucking

1780
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:55,480
take it down. Yeah. That's
not a good way to live.

1781
01:40:56,110 --> 01:40:58,910
They don't know what fucking killed
those people off. It's fascinating. It,

1782
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:01,180
they could have also died off
at the end of the ice age.

1783
01:41:01,181 --> 01:41:04,060
They think because a neanderthals,

1784
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:08,230
I don't know if they know
when the last ones existed,

1785
01:41:08,231 --> 01:41:11,720
but they think it's as recently as 40,000
years ago. Yeah. I think that was the,

1786
01:41:11,721 --> 01:41:14,590
the most recent explanations or ideas.

1787
01:41:14,591 --> 01:41:19,591
But that's also like 10,000 years ago
is when the woolly mammoth died off and

1788
01:41:19,721 --> 01:41:22,780
the saber tooth tiger, and that's also
the coincided with the end of the ice age.

1789
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,210
And so there's a bunch of guys that
think that that happened because of

1790
01:41:25,211 --> 01:41:30,211
asteroidal impacts that it might have
wiped off gigantic slice of the population

1791
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:32,800
and the end. It's all might've
been too stupid to survive.

1792
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,440
I Dunno if that makes any sense though.
I liked the fucking theory better.

1793
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:41,620
Fucking dairy is a little more awesome,
I must say.

1794
01:41:42,190 --> 01:41:46,000
Could you imagine if we found neanderthals
doe and they would be technically

1795
01:41:46,001 --> 01:41:50,680
human. So if some like shoot the box type
dude went out there and recruited them.

1796
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:54,730
Vandelay recruited them, you
know, brought him back to America.

1797
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:57,130
He's probably the closest
thing to a 20 Anatol.

1798
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:02,830
What'd you think about Vandelay running
out on his drug test? That stupid.

1799
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:07,960
That's unreal. And, but the idea of I ran
out cause it was on diuretics. I don't,

1800
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:13,120
come on, that's, I don't that
it's a little fishy dude.

1801
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:14,440
And you know,

1802
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:19,620
it's also coming from a guy who we sort
of already decided strongly suspect in

1803
01:42:22,121 --> 01:42:26,080
our nonmedical. Opinion's been rumored
according to our friend Phil Baroni.

1804
01:42:26,081 --> 01:42:29,220
He believes it. I know people who
have seen the contracts. Yeah.

1805
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,920
And who were told by officials
that we test for these drugs,

1806
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:35,710
but we don't test for steroids.
Well Jason Chambers,

1807
01:42:35,711 --> 01:42:39,550
they told him to get on steroids. Yeah.
They wanted them to get up to 185 pounds.

1808
01:42:39,551 --> 01:42:43,320
Chase is like a weight on one 71 70
right now. And there was like a bigger,

1809
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:47,650
you'll one 85 much bigger Jamus on wow.
Come kind of come.

1810
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:53,880
Yeah. They told him to get on
steroids. They don't, didn't pride.

1811
01:42:53,881 --> 01:42:57,370
They did not play it man. And he
was like, fucking, I don't think so.

1812
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:02,410
This is not a good idea. The
best idea. Yeah. But those
were interesting times, man.

1813
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:04,480
Like one of my favorite times ever.

1814
01:43:04,481 --> 01:43:06,980
I used to love getting up in
the middle of the night or,

1815
01:43:06,981 --> 01:43:10,450
or staying up in the middle of the night
and watching those cards take place.

1816
01:43:10,451 --> 01:43:13,300
Live from Japan, like, yeah.
What time would they start?

1817
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:15,100
It was totally like stupid late at night.
Right?

1818
01:43:15,190 --> 01:43:17,440
I would give the tapes from little Tokyo,
but the,

1819
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:21,160
at the like little rental stores that do
Japanese stuff, that's how you get them.

1820
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:25,480
That's how I see good. I was at UCLA man
and I would ride my bike to downtown.

1821
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,720
I didn't have a car at the time and I
would go to these video stories and they

1822
01:43:28,721 --> 01:43:32,470
would barely speak English and I would
go, I remember saying like, I want,

1823
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:36,670
I've used MMA didn't really exist
at the time. It was like pride.

1824
01:43:36,671 --> 01:43:40,330
And he looked at me and he goes and he
didn't really understand me. Hey Pride.

1825
01:43:40,331 --> 01:43:44,810
And I said,
yeah,

1826
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:47,600
I remember that man
fucking scream for years.

1827
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:51,590
Go from get was the only words I knew.
And in Japanese five left.

1828
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:55,700
There's only where a new Japanese, but
I looked at him and I go and I go, shit,

1829
01:43:55,701 --> 01:43:58,490
I'm trying to think of a name and I just
went room on a Saturday when he goes

1830
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:03,530
and he points to this area.
We had all these shoot and pride tapes,

1831
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:05,090
whole section.

1832
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:08,630
I remember going back there and back
over and over again just to like,

1833
01:44:08,631 --> 01:44:10,550
cause they had all of them and
you couldn't find him anywhere.

1834
01:44:10,551 --> 01:44:13,820
Optos alumina Sato broken
grappler man room and a sauna.

1835
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:18,170
Charles Taylor flying armbar
to any fucking so cool.

1836
01:44:18,230 --> 01:44:21,240
Does Edwards coming up on it?
He would do grappling competitions too.

1837
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:26,120
He was a bad motherfucker. Bad Mama
Jama. He can't cone and beat him twice.

1838
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:27,410
I did it.
Did it.

1839
01:44:27,410 --> 01:44:30,470
I just mentioned tournament and flying
fucking triangle like three out of four

1840
01:44:30,471 --> 01:44:31,000
people.

1841
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:31,833
What did,
okay,

1842
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:35,870
but think about the level of Jujitsu
then and then the level of guys now,

1843
01:44:35,871 --> 01:44:37,490
where do you,
where do you put him?

1844
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:42,480
I think that he was back then he was,

1845
01:44:42,481 --> 01:44:47,130
he was at the level we're at now,
almost that level back then.

1846
01:44:47,730 --> 01:44:50,750
But he was,
you know,

1847
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:54,200
a lot of those guys that the Japanese
aren't, aren't that strong? No,

1848
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:57,720
not physically imposing. So I think
that's what I have trouble in the US lots.

1849
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:00,630
Once you get the super athletes who are
physically imposing that just get just

1850
01:45:00,631 --> 01:45:04,230
as good. Sure. They're
slick. But you know,

1851
01:45:04,231 --> 01:45:06,570
and they have that like one shot,
one kill,

1852
01:45:06,571 --> 01:45:10,230
I'll die before I give up
kind of attitude. It just,

1853
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:13,930
they just can't deal with the
physical strength of, of, you know,

1854
01:45:13,931 --> 01:45:16,950
I'm American fucking
muscle shit like that.

1855
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:21,530
I totally agree with that. I make like
a, you've look at the guys like, uh,

1856
01:45:22,060 --> 01:45:26,610
there's no Japanese Mark
Coleman's? No. Fujita was

1857
01:45:28,770 --> 01:45:32,470
pretty, he was pretty close like gas, but
it was just a different sort of thing.

1858
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:35,660
All right. That Juno Kid. Um,
but he never panned out to be,

1859
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:40,480
yeah. I mean, well they made
him fight Fado and like, I mean,

1860
01:45:40,481 --> 01:45:43,480
how many nights was he in your sheet?
At his first fight? Yeah. You'll,

1861
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:46,720
she didn't his first fight fade or within
the first couple of years that was,

1862
01:45:46,721 --> 01:45:47,800
that was another pride thing.

1863
01:45:47,801 --> 01:45:52,420
Like they would feed guys to the God damn
wolves freedom to Fidor eight or what

1864
01:45:52,421 --> 01:45:56,110
are you thinking? They love that
shit and the knockouts brutal too.

1865
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:58,180
I mean he just really
is helpless and fatal.

1866
01:45:58,181 --> 01:46:02,050
It's just sniping him just
Poland back and watching it.

1867
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:06,280
It was exciting to watch. That was, hey
no one put a gun to his head alleged.

1868
01:46:06,281 --> 01:46:08,520
I mean maybe they did. I
don't know. Never know dude.

1869
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:12,680
Who's a scandal that getting one
guy with missing a finger do well,

1870
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:13,630
you know it's,
it's,

1871
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:16,720
that was another knock on
Japanese fighters that come
to us and oh there's big

1872
01:46:16,721 --> 01:46:20,020
in Japan and they can do well here.
It's big physical wrestlers, man.

1873
01:46:20,021 --> 01:46:21,160
It's hard to overcome that.

1874
01:46:21,161 --> 01:46:24,400
What that Japanese like you said
kind of balls out submission star.

1875
01:46:24,401 --> 01:46:26,700
We're going hard for the submission
if you don't get it. Okay.

1876
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:29,350
I've put your head through the ground.
Also, the weight cutting aspect,

1877
01:46:29,351 --> 01:46:31,120
they didn't really,
they weren't cutting weight.

1878
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:33,230
Not nothing like Americans
are cutting weight.

1879
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:36,760
So you would see guys weigh in and they
see the guy they were funding like what?

1880
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:41,410
That's crazy. Like soccer. I and
Matt Hughes. Perfect example.

1881
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:45,430
You Know Matt, he uses a big
fucking welterweight at at
time. I mean he had these,

1882
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:50,010
these garden hose muscles that would
connect the back of his head to

1883
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:50,843
his neck.
Yeah,

1884
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:55,200
just these thick ass neck fucking
country strong and shit and soccer.

1885
01:46:55,201 --> 01:46:57,720
I was just not able to deal with that.

1886
01:46:57,740 --> 01:47:01,350
Just it was as a different kind of
athlete. Good fucking passing ability.

1887
01:47:01,351 --> 01:47:04,700
Good Jujitsu, good Jujitsu.
He was the first wrestler.

1888
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:08,880
My opinion that really learned how to not
just take us down and ground and pound

1889
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:09,180
them,

1890
01:47:09,180 --> 01:47:13,260
but learn how to hit things like that
far side arm bar that he hit on George

1891
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:16,440
Saint Pierre. When George Saint Pierre
went for that Komora he had good Jujitsu.

1892
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:21,030
He had, he had real solid
skills, good defensive skills to,

1893
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:24,660
you know like the Frank Trigg, rear
naked choke. He can put guys away.

1894
01:47:24,661 --> 01:47:27,660
He could choke guys and that a soccer.

1895
01:47:27,661 --> 01:47:32,490
I was just not big enough to talk
with them. She doesn't handle soccer.

1896
01:47:32,491 --> 01:47:37,380
I had some good fucking kicks though
too. Big Ass legs, good leg kicks. Fast,

1897
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,670
fast,
accurate,

1898
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:42,690
loaded Sato but sato he was
one of the first guys to,

1899
01:47:42,691 --> 01:47:43,860
we saw get a little chimney.

1900
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:46,650
He started to go towards the
end of his career or just

1901
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,930
when? Called Luna?
Yeah. Yup. Clipped Bang.

1902
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:54,560
Or Am I in their rematch?
Knocked him right out. Yeah.

1903
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:57,890
How about Carl? Who Know How but what
a bad ass mother fucker that guy was.

1904
01:47:58,340 --> 01:48:02,960
He looked when he looked good, he looked
fucking nominal. Just super amazing.

1905
01:48:02,961 --> 01:48:05,610
And then some days you're just like,
fuck is this guy.

1906
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:10,540
How about when Bj and just charged
at him ran offense, pop, pop juice,

1907
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:15,320
Kale and him within the first 1520
seconds and just left him there.

1908
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:18,020
I mean it was like one of
the, we are just salt. Yeah.

1909
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:22,280
He's just like for the cops get me
like ran out of the cage in the back.

1910
01:48:22,281 --> 01:48:24,630
Like what the fuck is he
gone? It's going crazy. Hilo.

1911
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,550
I did it for Mana nuts man.

1912
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:32,280
He went crazy man. Do you think
he has a, you know the, the,

1913
01:48:32,281 --> 01:48:35,910
the odds are 10 to one against him.
Frankie Edgar,

1914
01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:40,710
10 to one 10 to one 10 to one
yeah. Yeah. I'd take that.

1915
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:45,240
Attended one, couple hundred
bucks on it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1916
01:48:45,241 --> 01:48:49,620
You never fucking know. I mean, especially
listening to what you're saying, man,

1917
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:52,560
listening to what you're saying
about him being in that good a shape.

1918
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:54,570
That was always a thing
that held him back.

1919
01:48:54,810 --> 01:48:57,150
And if there's one last
that fucks with them,

1920
01:48:57,180 --> 01:49:02,180
it's not the losses to Nick Diaz or
Rory Macdonald guys who were just too

1921
01:49:02,881 --> 01:49:04,590
fucking pig.
He shouldn't have been fighting.

1922
01:49:04,591 --> 01:49:08,370
Those guys shouldn't have been [inaudible]
70 and now that he's fighting at one

1923
01:49:08,371 --> 01:49:10,950
45 and you're like,
wait a minute.

1924
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:15,290
You used to fight at one 70
you fought Machida to a fuck.

1925
01:49:15,630 --> 01:49:18,790
What the fuck man, you fought
heavyweight. He has sent me,

1926
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:21,750
Machida was over two oh five but
she was essentially a heavyweight.

1927
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,730
It was ridiculous.

1928
01:49:23,910 --> 01:49:28,620
And here he is fighting at one 45 is
there ever a guy like that that went from

1929
01:49:28,621 --> 01:49:30,300
heavyweight down to one 45

1930
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:31,990
speaking of size disadvantage.

1931
01:49:31,991 --> 01:49:34,560
And then he fucking ends up choking out
Matt Hughes and knocking it out. Man.

1932
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:38,650
He knocked him out with one punch.
Him Choking out.

1933
01:49:38,651 --> 01:49:41,290
Matt Hughes could have been.

1934
01:49:41,620 --> 01:49:45,220
I don't in many ways kind of a worse
thing ever happened to him is that he kept

1935
01:49:45,221 --> 01:49:47,980
flirting with one 70
against these gigantic

1936
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:51,850
dudes. That success, I don't
know, maybe set asides too high.

1937
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:53,020
We're going to do that.

1938
01:49:53,021 --> 01:49:56,650
Was the Matt Hughes the only guy he
ever beat at one 70 that's interest.

1939
01:49:56,651 --> 01:50:01,040
Everybody forgets. Matt Hughes was the
only guy he ever beat. At 170 pounds.

1940
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:05,020
You're going to beat only
one guy going back and it is.

1941
01:50:05,021 --> 01:50:07,360
We kept going back to the
well at once. I'm like, Bro,

1942
01:50:07,361 --> 01:50:10,070
you just can't physically
handle those guys. Well,

1943
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:13,750
especially George Saint Pierre figured
out a way to tire him out first and then

1944
01:50:13,751 --> 01:50:18,310
beat him up. Increase should up and
your grease, your chest or back.

1945
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:21,340
Remember we had that guy that was doing
like Voodoo on them and shit rubbing his

1946
01:50:21,341 --> 01:50:26,341
chest and they caught him putting
Vaseline on his back like what are you

1947
01:50:26,441 --> 01:50:29,210
motherfuckers doing?
Tended that touching his nipples,

1948
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:31,640
his forehead and his fucking
giving them the choice.

1949
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:34,330
You have grease on your hands.

1950
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:38,250
It's not an interesting about the UFC
too is that they have cornermen men. Um,

1951
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:42,310
but they don't have it. Like boxing has
their own cut men. The UFC they bring,

1952
01:50:42,311 --> 01:50:45,070
they have staff cut men that
worked for the entire card.

1953
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:47,950
I think that's probably the
way to do it. Smarter. Yeah.

1954
01:50:47,951 --> 01:50:52,310
Cause you run in those Panama Lewis
type situations where Louie Resto. Yeah.

1955
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:55,950
Irish. Billy can come on. Give me the
bottle. I made a, that was the one I made.

1956
01:50:56,620 --> 01:51:01,450
Aaron Pryor and prior on the hardwire
Aguayo was fucking so good. Yeah.

1957
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:05,190
The loon resto thing, man. That was,
that was the craziest shit ever. Yup.

1958
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:09,390
What was the dude's name? The Billy
Irish. Billy Collins. Billy Collins. Yeah.

1959
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:12,750
That was crazy. That kid committed
suicide after himself. Drove us,

1960
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:15,340
drove his car into a,

1961
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:18,070
off a bridge for people don't
know what we're talking about.

1962
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:21,610
They took Louie [inaudible],
took the padding out of his gloves.

1963
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:25,510
That was back in the day. We're a boxing
goes were made it a horse hair and a,

1964
01:51:25,511 --> 01:51:28,630
they didn't have those foam pads like
they had today and sometimes they still

1965
01:51:28,631 --> 01:51:31,110
use those horse hair gloves.
Like that was what, uh,

1966
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:34,270
my Donna was trying to use with Floyd
Mayweather and they were like, pitch,

1967
01:51:34,271 --> 01:51:35,690
you're not using these fucking luck.

1968
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:38,140
Did you ever see that video
with Floyd Mayweather?

1969
01:51:38,141 --> 01:51:41,750
But the day after with the gloves
got a real problem with Mei Mei,

1970
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:42,693
whether it was putting on goes,

1971
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:45,110
it's real simple when you're
using these mother fucking gloves.

1972
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:46,100
Like it's real sad.

1973
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:49,720
I feel my fucking knuckle went using these
motherfucking glove and you know, uh,

1974
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:53,350
they're like, don't be scared and why
are you scared to be scared? Bitch,

1975
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:56,950
I ain't scared. I have 49 fucking fights.
Right? We're not using these gloves also,

1976
01:51:56,951 --> 01:52:01,300
dude, my hands are worth $78 million
without breaking them because,

1977
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:04,980
and not letting him have those gloves.
That was the big hit with a hammer.

1978
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:07,630
Donna's a vicious fucking punches.
But,

1979
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:10,750
so they took the horse
here out of the gloves.

1980
01:52:10,751 --> 01:52:15,730
They made a small hole and then pulled
the horse here out and it was essentially

1981
01:52:15,850 --> 01:52:19,810
just taped up knuckles and he beat
the shit out of Billy Collins. Fuck.

1982
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:22,930
This was undefeated at the time and
we really go fight or a little more

1983
01:52:22,931 --> 01:52:25,510
journeymen and big upset.

1984
01:52:25,930 --> 01:52:29,050
His eyes were so badly swollen.

1985
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:33,340
They took a photo after the
fight and the promoter said,

1986
01:52:33,341 --> 01:52:35,590
why don't you take it with his
eyes open and goes, those are open.

1987
01:52:36,210 --> 01:52:38,080
Like that's as far as he could
open them. I mean, they were like,

1988
01:52:38,410 --> 01:52:39,430
isn't that interesting?

1989
01:52:39,431 --> 01:52:43,120
That years later MMA fighters
were fighting bare knuckled. Yeah.

1990
01:52:43,390 --> 01:52:46,010
Banned for life.
Both banned

1991
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:50,390
for life. Louie Resto and Panama Lewis
and they both did time for assault. Yeah.

1992
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:53,720
And then Panama Louis went to work with
Tyson afterwards but couldn't work.

1993
01:52:53,721 --> 01:52:57,140
The corner. CanNot work. The
corner somehow are in his camp,

1994
01:52:57,170 --> 01:53:00,530
but couldn't work the corner. He can
train guys. You can't ever corner anybody.

1995
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:03,800
So as he still doing that to this
day, to this day, he's still doing it.

1996
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:08,840
Louie Resto never got it.
A little Billy Collins killed himself,

1997
01:53:09,710 --> 01:53:14,420
spiraled into depression, killed himself.
Louie Resto in and out of trouble.

1998
01:53:14,421 --> 01:53:16,370
Homeless drug addict.
Never got it.

1999
01:53:16,371 --> 01:53:20,610
You know that I saw a documentary
where he tried to talk to,

2000
01:53:20,650 --> 01:53:25,280
to Billy Collins Dad, we wouldn't
have it. Oh Mom. The mom forgave him,

2001
01:53:25,281 --> 01:53:29,480
the mom and sister and forgave him.
But the dad wouldn't have it. And uh,

2002
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:32,000
he confessed during the,
the thing too that,

2003
01:53:32,001 --> 01:53:34,370
that they'd wrapped his hand
and like this plaster stuff,

2004
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:39,550
the same shit that probably are Rito
Margarito shit that was in the fucking two

2005
01:53:39,681 --> 01:53:44,370
thousands bleeding out of
his ears. Nose. I mean,

2006
01:53:44,390 --> 01:53:47,030
and then he can, that's
fucking right. That's almost,

2007
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:49,790
that's assault with a deadly
weapon. I don't, I don't get why.

2008
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:53,480
And also I never got wide. Louie
Resto and Panama, Louis went to jail,

2009
01:53:53,481 --> 01:53:54,260
banned for life.

2010
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:58,070
Margarito gets caught trying to do the
same thing and it's not to the song like

2011
01:53:58,071 --> 01:54:02,030
it's not you got suspension, but do
Louie Resto did time for that. I mean,

2012
01:54:02,031 --> 01:54:04,980
panel Lewis did. Tom, Shane Mosley
that beat the fuck out of him. Right.

2013
01:54:04,981 --> 01:54:08,330
Beat the piss out of them after they
found out they wouldn't let him use the

2014
01:54:08,331 --> 01:54:11,770
wrap. They put new raps and he
got the shit kicked out of them.

2015
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:14,650
Shane was like torturing him,

2016
01:54:14,651 --> 01:54:17,610
like he was punishing him for
that and that that was it.

2017
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:21,200
It was a great fight for Shane. That was
Shane's last great fight too, by the way.

2018
01:54:21,270 --> 01:54:24,970
Totally fucking pistol. Whipped and bad.
Apparently. Shane's a little punchy now.

2019
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:29,540
People who have talked to
them and interviewing them
now they say that it's a,

2020
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:31,780
he had a few too many,
you know,

2021
01:54:31,870 --> 01:54:34,960
probably the Margarito fight should
have been the last one didn't help,

2022
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:37,960
but he fought Canelo after that
and fall may with her. Yeah,

2023
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:41,980
and they were their Canelo but Canelo
want apparently was that was the beating

2024
01:54:42,190 --> 01:54:45,640
that tough man. Fuck yeah,
and better all the time.

2025
01:54:45,970 --> 01:54:48,220
Getting that Floyd Mayweather
fight was a good fight for him.

2026
01:54:48,940 --> 01:54:50,850
Taught him a lot of shit.
You got to,

2027
01:54:50,890 --> 01:54:53,530
you know when you're in with a guy
like that, then moves like Floyd does.

2028
01:54:53,890 --> 01:54:56,410
Until you see that you don't
know what the fuck that is,

2029
01:54:56,411 --> 01:54:58,210
you know you're not going to
get that in training. Who's,

2030
01:54:58,330 --> 01:55:02,080
who's going to be your sparring partner?
That's undefeated world champion,

2031
01:55:02,081 --> 01:55:06,160
one of the eight or 10 best fighters
that's ever walked the face of the planet.

2032
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:09,870
The first time you see something, you
don't want it to be in a fight. Yeah.

2033
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:15,040
You want to have seen that before. At
some point in training, you know, I,

2034
01:55:15,041 --> 01:55:19,170
I play chess. Um, I really like,
yeah, that's Billy Collins.

2035
01:55:19,171 --> 01:55:21,720
After the fight with his eyes open,
his eyes are open right now.

2036
01:55:21,721 --> 01:55:26,230
It's so far that's as good as it would
get. Oh my God. That's so fucked up.

2037
01:55:26,730 --> 01:55:30,280
That's so fucked. Jesus. Never the same.

2038
01:55:31,330 --> 01:55:35,060
He went blind. Right. He was lost some
of his vision's awesome. His vision,

2039
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:36,960
and he was trying to sue.

2040
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:41,160
He tried to sue basically the
commission for not catching the,

2041
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:44,850
the gloves because his dad at
the end of the fight, you see it,

2042
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:49,590
Louie Resto goes up and shakes hands
with Billy Collins Dad who's his trainer

2043
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:54,030
and he feels the glove and he goes, wait,
hey, hey. And he gets a commissioner,

2044
01:55:54,031 --> 01:55:57,030
but he starts yelling,
this club's half the patterns out of it.

2045
01:55:57,390 --> 01:55:59,470
He shook hands and felt the glove.
Yeah.

2046
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:04,410
And he tried to sue the
athletic commission for
letting Louie Resto fight with

2047
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:08,700
the pattern move from the glove and
not protecting the sun. So it kept,

2048
01:56:08,701 --> 01:56:10,680
Billy comes from fighting
because they were suing.

2049
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:14,160
And so he was just sitting around
and just getting worse and you know,

2050
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:16,470
got depressed and that was all she wrote.

2051
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:19,470
Wow. That's fucking fine. Yeah. Yeah.

2052
01:56:19,471 --> 01:56:24,150
And Panama Lewis is this same fucking
guy who gave Richard Aaron Pryor that

2053
01:56:24,330 --> 01:56:25,163
bottle,

2054
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:30,000
the bottle he mixed and he came out
against Alexis Arguayo just supercharged.

2055
01:56:30,030 --> 01:56:32,400
Yup. Like whatever it was,
it was in that bottle.

2056
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:37,030
Louie Resto said that he used to give him,
uh,

2057
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:40,860
they were asthma pills, crushed up
asthma pill. So you would, you would,

2058
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:44,860
it would get your breathing
back basically. Amphetamines,
Christof Amphetamines.

2059
01:56:44,861 --> 01:56:45,694
He used to treat asthma.

2060
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:49,320
Isn't it interesting that both
Aaron Pryor, any more trivia? Just,

2061
01:56:49,321 --> 01:56:51,310
just let me know.
Trivia master,

2062
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:54,820
but both Aaron Pryor and Louie
Resto became drug addicts. Yeah.

2063
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:57,400
Isn't that interesting.
And Alexis, shark whale,

2064
01:56:58,160 --> 01:56:59,650
Eddie really big struggles with cocaine.

2065
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:03,450
Big struggles killed himself in Nicaragua.
Uh,

2066
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:05,920
well wasn't he like a
politician in Nicaragua?

2067
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:08,290
There there's some suspicion about yeah.

2068
01:57:08,291 --> 01:57:11,760
And it wasn't like a gunshot
wound to the chest. Yeah.

2069
01:57:11,770 --> 01:57:15,160
Which is pretty weird for suicide.
Yeah. Well that's the official story.

2070
01:57:15,170 --> 01:57:18,670
I niggerize he killed himself
while a lot of boxers, especially,

2071
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:21,490
they wind up with depression,
you know,

2072
01:57:21,491 --> 01:57:24,820
from just a repeated trauma and cocaine.

2073
01:57:24,970 --> 01:57:27,730
Cocaine also means no Bueno.

2074
01:57:30,170 --> 01:57:34,510
Who Was it? Um, Arturo Gotti I
saw thinking about his supposedly,

2075
01:57:34,820 --> 01:57:37,690
oh, that wasn't no fucking
suicide. That bitch killed them

2076
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:40,400
once.
But what I thought was interesting,

2077
01:57:40,850 --> 01:57:45,280
I saw a very evenhanded documentary
about his alleged to aside slash murder,

2078
01:57:45,290 --> 01:57:47,900
whatever you think.
And not once did they go,

2079
01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:49,760
did they mention pugilistic dementia,

2080
01:57:49,761 --> 01:57:53,450
which causes depression and suicidal
tendencies. They wouldn't, didn't once go.

2081
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:57,410
Maybe that hit in the head one too many
fucking times. You know what I mean?

2082
01:57:57,411 --> 01:58:00,710
He didn't, they never once brought it up.
I thought it deserved mentioning that,

2083
01:58:00,711 --> 01:58:03,560
you know,
his brain had to be putting at that point,

2084
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:07,490
but didn't he have a big, wasn't there
like at some point in time, wasn't there?

2085
01:58:07,491 --> 01:58:11,540
Um, during the, the, the, the
incident, whatever killed him.

2086
01:58:11,830 --> 01:58:13,720
It wasn't there a head trauma,
a big

2087
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:16,570
he had gotten in a fight that night.
That's why they had argued,

2088
01:58:16,571 --> 01:58:19,750
he had gotten in a fight on the street
in Brazil and they interviewed a cab

2089
01:58:19,751 --> 01:58:20,081
driver.

2090
01:58:20,081 --> 01:58:24,670
The cab driver drove him from where
he was from where the fight was to his

2091
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:28,480
apartment and the guy said those blood
on the back of my seat, they hit,

2092
01:58:28,481 --> 01:58:29,620
they had beaten him up pretty good.

2093
01:58:29,621 --> 01:58:32,650
Like he had hit the ground and he
had gotten in a fight with all these

2094
01:58:32,651 --> 01:58:33,101
Brazilians.

2095
01:58:33,101 --> 01:58:37,000
He had been Malvin off at this club and
his wife left him and that's why they

2096
01:58:37,001 --> 01:58:37,840
were arguing that night.

2097
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:40,450
And so he had gotten a fight with
like three dudes on the street.

2098
01:58:40,690 --> 01:58:44,680
So cab driver said, yeah and there was
blood on my seat. He had, you know,

2099
01:58:45,130 --> 01:58:46,150
nobody beat him like,

2100
01:58:46,340 --> 01:58:49,060
and then we said all that she had people
beat him up and then now he was beat up

2101
01:58:49,061 --> 01:58:51,160
in the cap when he was in the back of my,

2102
01:58:51,210 --> 01:58:54,370
my cab and then he was
found on the ground.

2103
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:57,730
And the only thing that
makes zero sense to me,

2104
01:58:58,090 --> 01:59:01,300
zero of all the whole story.
I can see both sides of it.

2105
01:59:01,301 --> 01:59:04,780
The only thing that makes zero sense is
the wife claimed was seen in the morning

2106
01:59:04,781 --> 01:59:08,500
and thought he was asleep.
If you see the photos of Arturo Gotti,

2107
01:59:08,501 --> 01:59:13,300
which I have on the ground,
he's dead in a pool of his own blood.

2108
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:17,140
Clearly like you couldn't walk past
this and think he's okay. Well,

2109
01:59:17,310 --> 01:59:20,920
in her stories that she saw him and
thought he was all right. He always,

2110
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:23,230
he always finds that's
what they said he was.

2111
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:26,830
He always used to pass out and fall
asleep drunk. That it, I'm like,

2112
01:59:27,490 --> 01:59:31,510
I don't know how you could walk past
that and go, ah, he's fine. You know?

2113
01:59:31,511 --> 01:59:34,840
Okay honey. Okay. All right, good.
I'll make some coffee and that's,

2114
01:59:34,841 --> 01:59:38,380
that's your story, but I hooked up with
the wrong bitch. A very interesting,

2115
01:59:38,381 --> 01:59:40,010
it's an interesting case to say that

2116
01:59:40,590 --> 01:59:43,340
case. It's, it's a very sad case,

2117
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:45,800
but you know when she got out of jail,

2118
01:59:45,801 --> 01:59:47,420
did you ever see the
photos of her out of jail?

2119
01:59:47,421 --> 01:59:49,640
She was like smiling and
laughing when they released.

2120
01:59:50,060 --> 01:59:54,530
Yeah, that was, yeah, that was, that was
family was not pleased about that one.

2121
01:59:54,770 --> 01:59:58,430
Although if I got left, if I got to let
out of a Brazilian Gera for any reason,

2122
01:59:58,670 --> 02:00:02,590
I'd be smiling and happy too.
So I don't take, I don't,

2123
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:06,050
I don't hold that so much against it
cause I'd be thrilled that I'm not,

2124
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:09,300
you know, indicted for murder
in Brazil. I'd be thrilled. Um,

2125
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:10,310
he said it kind of fucked up.

2126
02:00:11,060 --> 02:00:15,560
No, like he was a guy who was like
sort of, his career was dwindling down.

2127
02:00:15,770 --> 02:00:18,920
He wasn't going to be like
the top of the food chain,

2128
02:00:18,921 --> 02:00:20,150
Floyd Mayweather type fighters,

2129
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:24,110
but he found another guy that was on
his level and then it became one of the

2130
02:00:24,111 --> 02:00:28,490
first trilogy is one of the first series
of fights where both everyone knew

2131
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:30,650
these guys weren't going to win a title.
Yeah.

2132
02:00:30,830 --> 02:00:34,190
So it was like one of the first fights
where it was just an awesome fight

2133
02:00:34,370 --> 02:00:38,660
because they matched up together. Well,
you know, it wasn't an awesome vibe,

2134
02:00:38,661 --> 02:00:42,560
but Micky, Micky Ward wasn't going to
be world champion. Arturo Gotti wasn't,

2135
02:00:42,690 --> 02:00:44,480
he had a title at one point in time,

2136
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:46,310
but he wasn't going to
be the best in the world.

2137
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:49,940
Everyone knew and that was the thing
about boxers is we always wanted to see an

2138
02:00:49,941 --> 02:00:53,210
undefeated fighter and we always want
to see a guy fight for the title.

2139
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:58,350
Like the thing about rocky Marciano was
always at Marsianno died 49 oh yeah,

2140
02:00:58,780 --> 02:01:02,930
he was up best matching. I don't
never lost. Well, in boxing,

2141
02:01:03,230 --> 02:01:05,900
that was like the first duo.

2142
02:01:06,020 --> 02:01:10,010
Those two guys going at it the first
match up where we knew that they weren't

2143
02:01:10,011 --> 02:01:12,530
going to get a world title, but
we still wanted to see it. Yeah.

2144
02:01:13,150 --> 02:01:13,983
You know what's,

2145
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:18,310
what's different in combat
sports that's unique in combat.

2146
02:01:18,311 --> 02:01:20,980
Sports is different than another,
especially team sports.

2147
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:25,360
Popularity and ability
just don't go together.

2148
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:28,730
They don't know the best guy isn't the
most popular guy in our church. God,

2149
02:01:28,731 --> 02:01:33,490
he was that guy that I would pay to
watch that guy fight no matter what.

2150
02:01:33,491 --> 02:01:34,211
No matter when,

2151
02:01:34,211 --> 02:01:37,750
even though there were much better guys
out there watching Arturo Gotti fight

2152
02:01:37,751 --> 02:01:40,310
was really something special
and he got with Micky Ward

2153
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:43,190
and they had that amazing trilogy.
Um,

2154
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:47,780
the problem is God can do you see the
Mayweather fight? That was like humility.

2155
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:52,010
I was like hard to watch as hard
to watch those too many after that,

2156
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:54,380
after the Micky ward trilogy.
Yeah. It was also God,

2157
02:01:54,381 --> 02:01:57,470
he had already taken a lot of punishment,
his career and he wasn't,

2158
02:01:57,530 --> 02:02:00,220
he just had no business being in
the ring with Mayweather Mayweather.

2159
02:02:00,230 --> 02:02:04,520
There's way too sharp in his prime.
Yeah, I mean I think maybe it was better.

2160
02:02:04,810 --> 02:02:08,360
I mean, he was so sharp then.
Unbelievable. Great Guy. He's amazing.

2161
02:02:08,361 --> 02:02:10,610
Now I don't even know why I'm
saying this is amazing now,

2162
02:02:10,611 --> 02:02:15,250
but even like a younger, even faster
version of, of Mayweather, he was killed.

2163
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:19,760
You know what's really
incredible is fucking Hopkins
winning a world title nine.

2164
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:22,520
That's one of the weirdest examples.
Unboxing of all time.

2165
02:02:22,521 --> 02:02:27,440
You want to talk about a guy that just
never faded off? No, still wicked good.

2166
02:02:27,441 --> 02:02:32,210
I mean knock that Russian dude down in
the 10th round at 49 but style wise,

2167
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:34,730
he's the kind of guy,
if you looked at all his fights,

2168
02:02:34,970 --> 02:02:38,060
the big knock on Hopkins and he never
took a lot of risks. You never know.

2169
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:39,200
Never taking damage.

2170
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:43,700
He's fighting it 50 cause he
never took those and talks great.

2171
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,100
It's great. Yeah. Yeah.
His brain isn't putting,

2172
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:50,900
I was just amazed that his body's holding
up. It doesn't look totally the same.

2173
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:53,720
Like he doesn't look as muscular.
He's a little more smooth, loose,

2174
02:02:53,721 --> 02:02:56,210
a little more soft,
but not much of a difference.

2175
02:02:56,270 --> 02:02:58,980
I think it was part of the reason he's
moving up in weight class a lot is,

2176
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:04,400
you know, speed is the first thing to go
and I think he realizes I can beat these

2177
02:03:04,401 --> 02:03:06,740
cruisers,
I can outslick these cruisers.

2178
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:10,190
I don't if you'd do that against
Gennady Golovkin guys at middleweight,

2179
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:14,420
the middleweight, Andre Ward,
those guys are fast and I think he,

2180
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:18,500
I think he's smart. He's a really
smart guy, is a boxing Iq was amazing.

2181
02:03:18,710 --> 02:03:21,830
I think you realize is I move up,
I cannot slick these guys.

2182
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:23,630
That's a good point
because for middle weight,

2183
02:03:24,190 --> 02:03:27,930
the last guy that he had real problems
with is Germane Taylor and Taylor was way

2184
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:32,900
fast, one 61 60 lightening
fast and then, you know,

2185
02:03:33,050 --> 02:03:37,400
look, look at the performances that
he's had at light heavyweight and um,

2186
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:41,900
you know, look at what's his name for
Pittsburgh? Uh, the, the, the white kid,

2187
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:46,440
um, uh, Kelly Patrick from uh,

2188
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:50,930
Youngstown on Nice town. Yeah. Kelly
Pavlik was a slower guy. Yeah. You know,

2189
02:03:50,931 --> 02:03:54,710
and Kelly Pavlik didn't have that sort
of ethnicity. Him looked like a fool.

2190
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:56,170
It was beautiful performance.

2191
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:59,810
I made him look ridiculous for 12 rounds
and everybody was shocked and he was

2192
02:03:59,811 --> 02:04:03,050
doing it at what, like 43 back then
it was like, this is incredible.

2193
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:06,560
Six years later you would think there's
no way he's going to win a world title

2194
02:04:06,561 --> 02:04:07,730
six years from them.

2195
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:10,230
But I think that's why he's moving up
and staying in these weight classes where

2196
02:04:10,231 --> 02:04:13,280
he doesn't worry about that kind of
speed. Yeah, that's a good point, man.

2197
02:04:13,281 --> 02:04:15,200
That's the hardest thing to
deal with at that age. Yeah,

2198
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:20,260
that's a good point because he's so good
at being in the right place to make a

2199
02:04:20,331 --> 02:04:24,680
guy move. And you also, you know
how like you see a guy like,

2200
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:28,850
like today we saw like there was one point
in time where cubs wants and winds up

2201
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:30,770
and I'm seeing him getting
ready to throw kick.

2202
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:32,990
It's cause we've seen a guy
getting ready to throw a kick.

2203
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:36,620
We've seen a subtle changes and when a
guy's getting ready to throw a kick and

2204
02:04:36,621 --> 02:04:38,610
you could spot it,
Bernard Hopkins,

2205
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:42,480
he's seen so many guys in
front of him do things.

2206
02:04:42,481 --> 02:04:44,220
So many guys try to hit him with punches.

2207
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:46,620
He knows what they're going to do before
and they know what they're going to do.

2208
02:04:46,670 --> 02:04:47,030
Oh yeah.

2209
02:04:47,030 --> 02:04:51,780
So when he's stepping and forcing guys
into positions where he knows what

2210
02:04:51,781 --> 02:04:53,580
they're going to do,
once they get into that position,

2211
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:55,770
they don't even know
what they're going to do.

2212
02:04:55,771 --> 02:04:57,900
He's like two and three
steps ahead of them.

2213
02:04:58,170 --> 02:05:01,380
So because of that boxing
knowledge that he has,

2214
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:05,770
you get to see like this
really pure sort of a like a,

2215
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:09,030
a pure execution of boxing from him.

2216
02:05:09,031 --> 02:05:13,320
Dismantling the executioner, but
not anymore. Now he's an alien.

2217
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:15,990
I had to say that he's the alien and
there'd be throwing the softball.

2218
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,720
Got to hit it. She called him.
Yeah. He wears a rubber mask.

2219
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:23,080
He goes into the ring with a rubber
it,

2220
02:05:23,130 --> 02:05:26,250
where's the rubber fucking alien mask?
He calls himself the alien.

2221
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:28,890
