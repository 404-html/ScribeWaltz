1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,890
Hey everybody,

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,293
what the fuck?

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,493
What's up?

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,030
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you by the dollar Shave

5
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:14,940
club@dollarshaveclub.com.

6
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:19,941
You can get razors sent to you for
just six bucks for a four pack,

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,260
six bucks for the best
quality blades you can get.

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,880
There's a lot of shit out there when
it comes to a razors that people are,

9
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:30,270
uh,

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,110
trying to,

11
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:31,590
uh,

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,090
sell you on and promote.

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,800
That's a lot of nonsense.

14
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:35,011
This is,

15
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:39,630
we need a sharp blade that
cuts the fucking hair on
your face and all this other

16
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,770
self lubing backscratching laser pointing,

17
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:46,470
vibrating text messaging.

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,080
That's ridiculous for a razor.

19
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,943
You don't need that.

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,340
Imagine if your razors
really did text messaging.

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,701
It's probably happening.

22
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:56,400
It's on the way someone's probably
working on right now and they listened to

23
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:57,570
this podcast and like you,

24
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:58,380
Dick,

25
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,370
you've sabotaged my plan on a
meet to sabotage your plant dude.

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,930
But sorrow slowly.

27
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,003
Look at that.

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,330
Look what it says right there.

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,193
A dollar month,

30
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,360
$6 a month,

31
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,500
$9 a month.

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,440
If you want to get super
crafty and go to Ganga Blades,

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,930
it's nine bucks in the Middlesex,

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,690
but you can get them for
a dollar a dollar a month.

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,231
I mean,

36
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:20,220
come on son.

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,740
Why did you want to throw money away?

38
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,120
They also have a ton of other cool shit
for your bathroom like Dr Carver's,

39
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,230
easy shave butter and one wipe Charlies,

40
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,940
but wipes from men.

41
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,290
I don't know why they have to be for men,

42
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,360
like of a chick comes
over your house and uses,

43
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,194
but wipe Charlies.

44
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,110
He said one of those weird things
like when a chick uses your deodorant,

45
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,840
I think they need more
like a bigger light,

46
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,520
so that's why their
dues have bigger bottle.

47
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,930
I guess.

48
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,310
What if you're doing a really large woman,

49
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,051
whatever,

50
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:49,884
whatever,

51
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,390
and since dollar shave club.com doesn't
waste their money on ridiculous shave

52

tech,

53
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,950

the big shave companies charge.

63
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,900
razor for an extra 50 bucks.

64
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,380
Holla.

65
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,990
We're also brought to you by legal zoom
and legal zoom is a way that you can do

66
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:46,470
a lot of things that you wouldn't order
it ordinarily have to go to a law office

67
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:47,304
to do.

68
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,130
You could do them all from
the comfort of your own home.

69
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,310
You can do them while you're doing other
shit like you could conceivably play

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,980
Xbox and w in the time that it
takes you to respond after you get

71
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,700
killed.

72
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,350
You could fill out forms if you're
just a fucking real multitasking nut.

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,220
You could have porn on in the
background and also legal zoom.

74
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,540
You could probably do it in,

75
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,830
in like if you have a large laptop or
if you have good eyes and you could like

76
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:17,560
do it in a split window
format while shaving.

77
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,101
Yes,

78
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:18,970
while shaving.

79
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:19,721
Good point.

80
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:20,830
Mr Antonopoulos.

81
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,170
If you've been thinking about
starting your own business,

82
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:25,900
you can incorporate and form an LLC.

83
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,790
You could do it at legal zoom and you
could form an LLC starting at 99 bucks.

84
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,260
You can protect your family with
a last will for only 69 bucks.

85
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:38,470
You can get a living trust
power of attorney and more.

86
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Nine out of 10 customers who have used
legal zoom would recommend the service to

87
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:46,150
their friends and family.

88
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,710
That is huge.

89
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,820
You know what else is huge?

90
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,280
They got an a plus from
the better business.

91
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:51,850
Pure.

92
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,410
That's double huge so that way you got
to huges because like nine out of 10

93
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:56,621
you're like,

94
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:56,861
okay,

95
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,694
who did they ask?

96
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,121
It's like,

97
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:02,080
you know they say half the people say
that the earth is less than 10,000 years

98
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:02,500
old.

99
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,680
Half the people in this country believe
in the biblical version of the Bible.

100
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:10,681
It's like 40 something a high 40
over 46% shocking but not really.

101
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:14,710
When you consider the fact that 100%
of all people who answer surveys are

102
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,573
idiots,

103
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,700
so half of the idiots think
the earth is 10,000 years old,

104
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,470
but for real legit.

105
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Nine out of 10 customers who have actually
used legal zoom say that they would

106
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:29,110
recommend it and the a plus
from the better business bureau.

107
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,400
You can't buy that Sun.

108
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:30,791
Okay?

109
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,680
That only exists if a company is good,

110
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,480
they can help out with trademarks,

111
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,290
copyrights,

112
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:35,890
patents.

113
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,820
In the past 12 years,

114
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:41,350
over 2 million Americans have used legal
zoom and they've saved ass loads of

115
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:42,070
money,

116
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,950
big ass loads like the kind
of ass loads that you need.

117
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,020
Those those wipes for like large,

118
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,003
large buds.

119
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,353

122
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,820
Legal Zoom is not a law firm,

123
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,900
but if you are in the middle of filling
out forms and doing it all by herself

124
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,370
and you fucking panic and you're like,

125
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:04,204
I'm going to jail,

126
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,480
you can get connected through legal zoom
to a third party attorney and they can

127
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:12,610
provide you with self help services.

128
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,660
That's what legal zoom
is really there for,

129
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,560
but the third party attorney
thing is gigantic if,

130
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,020
if everything goes awry,

131
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,300
which a word a very rarely used by very,

132
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,470
I feel strong when I use it.

138
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,500
will you?

139
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
My name is Joe Rogan.

140
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,060
No,

141
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,893
someone else could.

142
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,861
I guess you go,

143
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:42,790
there's more than one of us.

144
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,103
There's a guy in a,

145
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,550
I guess he's in Idaho now,

146
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,200
has the Joe rogan.com

147
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,260
I actually liked it that he has
it now because I just know he was,

148
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,100
he was so douchey about it when I wanted
to buy it and I'm glad I never did

149
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,890
anyway,

150
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,130
go

151
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,751
to on it.

152
00:05:58,751 --> 00:05:59,270
Dot.

153
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,350
I shouldn't say douchey.

154
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,310
He recognized the value of it and
he was playing hardball with me.

155
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,701
Okay.

156
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:05,301
That's a better way.

157
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,620
It was smart on his side.

158
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:07,990
He would say I'm Douchey Shit.

159
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,480
All the fucking emails that
he probably gets from people.

160
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,411
Black holes and stuff.

161
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:12,651
Yeah,

162
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:14,570
all sorts of black dicks.

163
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,050
It's probably got more black dicks
and any other Joe Rogan but me

164
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,751
other than me,

165
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,320
I'm like,

166
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
I'm a close second.

167
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,230
Do you get a lot of
plaques every now and then?

168
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,220
Every now and then in the early days of
the podcast when we would bring up black

169
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:27,531
hawks,

170
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:30,230
like every 30 30 was a confusion.

171
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,730
There was something that was wrong.

172
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:32,720
We didn't know what we're talking about.

173
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,690
Black Hawks are just,

174
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,420
we started talking about that.

175
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,920
We're also brought to you by on at.com.

176
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:37,281
It's o,

177
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:37,851
n N.

178
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:40,100
I t if you have not been
to on it in a while.

179
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,130
We have a lot of new
and fabulous shit like,

180
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:43,520
uh,

181
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,480
the warrior bar,

182
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:49,481
which is our new protein bar that is
made from organic buffalo meat with no

183
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,040
antibiotics,

184
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,360
no hormones.

185
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,330
It is gluten free with no nitrates.

186
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,310
It is also no MSG,

187
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,091
no soy,

188
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:00,140
no lactose.

189
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,040
And it is 14 grams of protein in each
serving with only four grams of fat and

190
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:08,684
it's healthy fat.

191
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,530
Does it help?

192
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,540
Bisons are very healthy animals.

193
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,550
Buffalo there,

194
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,790
you know,

195
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,623
you,

196
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,910
there's very few wild buffalo these days,

197
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:18,890
unfortunately because our great ancestors,

198
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:19,431
not mine,

199
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:20,150
but yours.

200
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,080
There were cons.

201
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,610
Mine came from Italy and Ireland.

202
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,740
They had no part in the buffalo slang.

203
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,600
They came here during the 20th century.

204
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,861
But for,

205
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:28,694
um,

206
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,780
the people that,

207
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:30,200
uh,

208
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,200
did wipe out the Buffalo Buffalo's
are an incredibly healthy and powerful

209
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:36,650
animals.

210
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,000
They killed a fuck load of them,

211
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:39,560
but they saved a lot of them too.

212
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,300
Like a lot of people think
that buffaloes are extinct.

213
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:42,590
They're not in Texas.

214
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,041
In fact,

215
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:43,431
you can,

216
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:43,970
um,

217
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,300
you can find them at a lot of,

218
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:45,920
uh,

219
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,030
private hunting ranches.

220
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:51,380
They have buffaloes and they have
a lot of these buffalo farms.

221
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,290
It's like one of the best high
protein meats that you can get it.

222
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,600
There is such a crazy animal too.

223
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,520
It's a huge fucking what a,

224
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:58,761
I mean,

225
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:03,020
what an amazing animal to perfect animal
really to represent the wild west.

226
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:06,800
It's big giant wild
cow with a lion's mane,

227
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,580
you know,

228
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,413
they're so cool.

229
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,140
Anyway,

230
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,050
they're yummy and delicious and
we sell their meat at on it.

231
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,600
We also have,

232
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:14,820
uh,

233
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,760
a wide variety of other healthy
foods like organic coconut oil,

234
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,710
which is super healthy for you as well.

235
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:26,480
Hemp protein powder and we have a new
supplement called earth grown nutrients

236
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,760
with earth grow nutrients is,

237
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,840
it's a combination of,

238
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:31,190
uh,

239
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,840
several different greens,

240
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,350
things that are like super healthy for
you and you can add it to protein powers

241
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,490
and it just gives you a little extra
boost of nutrients if you're covers your

242
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:41,870
bases as it were.

243
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,870
If you're not really totally diligent
about your diet or if you're a busy person

244
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:52,151
and you do not have the time to eat
many servings of fruits and vegetables a

245
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,310
day,

246
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,240
you can cover a lot of that with a,

247
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:56,490
a good nutrient blend.

248
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,520
The best way is to get things
that come from actual whole foods.

249
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,773
Um,

250
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,220
your body can process synthetic vitamins,

251
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:09,660
but for sure they're not going to process
them as well as actual nutrients that

252
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:11,400
come from food itself.

253
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,100
And what we use is a combination of,

254
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:14,911
you know,

255
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:16,320
essentially what we do
with everything else.

256
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:21,150
We just get the best nutritious things
that we can find the best strength and

257
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,370
conditioning equipment we can find.

258
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:25,380
And with this earth grown nutrients,

259
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,070
we have a lot of really exotic
ingredients like Peruvian purple corn,

260
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:30,810
which is high in antioxidants,

261
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,010
Asai uh,

262
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,070
a lot of other grapes,

263
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,421
grapes,

264
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:36,254
Skins,

265
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,360
Camou I don't know what that is.

266
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,880
So these are really potent antioxidants.

267
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,800
Mcqueen,

268
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,160
Barry [inaudible],

269
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,850
m,

270
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,240
a,

271
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,970
Q.

272
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:45,980
U.

273
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,201
I,

274
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,034
how would you say that?

275
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,350
My key bury my kid?

276
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,160
This is a few words that I know I've,

277
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,120
I've read that word many,

278
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:51,601
many times.

279
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:52,680
I've never even tried to say it.

280
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,203
Um,

281
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,470
the Greens has a,

282
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:56,880
a combination of wheat grass,

283
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:57,750
barley grass,

284
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:58,411
oat grass,

285
00:09:58,411 --> 00:09:59,000
Kale,

286
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,833
Kelp,

287
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,780
Alfalfa,

288
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:01,531
spirulina.

289
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:05,400
And what we're just trying to do is
give you an option to add to your food,

290
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:06,900
especially to a protein drink.

291
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:07,710
That's how I,

292
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,550
that's how I use it,

293
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,190
which just covers a lot of
your basis nutritionally.

294
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,600
Excellent stuff.

295
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:13,790
Really,

296
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,220
um,

297
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,000
really healthy.

298
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,900
It doesn't taste bad and you can throw
it right into your food and also has

299
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:19,890
probiotics in it.

300
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,060
Super good for you.

301
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,510
Um,

302
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,460
use the Codeword Rogan at Ana and
you will save 10% off any end.

303
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:27,330
All supplements,

304
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,440
the fitness equipment,

305
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:28,981
again,

306
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:30,240
we sell the best shit we can find,

307
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:31,440
whether it's kettlebells,

308
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,101
steel,

309
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:32,641
maces,

310
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:33,690
steel clubs,

311
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,741
ab wheels,

312
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:35,521
medicine balls,

313
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:36,210
we just fought.

314
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,440
Who makes the best equipment,

315
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,640
buy it from them.

316
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,623
That's the way to do it.

317
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,770
Battle ropes.

318
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,130
And we also have kettle bells that
we've designed and made ourselves these

319
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:45,740
Zombie bells and the primal bells.

320
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,720
Those are artistic kettle
bells that are also functional.

321
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:50,910
They're three d designed,

322
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,470
the three d graft them,

323
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:52,830
uh,

324
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,690
to make sure that they're balanced though,

325
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:56,010
so that they're not just cool looking,

326
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:57,120
but they're actually functional.

327
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:57,541
When you,

328
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:57,840
uh,

329
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,950
do the kettlebell swings,

330
00:10:58,951 --> 00:10:59,151
they don't,

331
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:00,240
they're not like off kilter.

332
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,190
What's steel belts?

333
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,110
Steel belts are these
bags that are filled with,

334
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:04,590
um,

335
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,730
these little tiny,

336
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,000
uh,

337
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,370
steel pellets and their,

338
00:11:07,371 --> 00:11:08,250
their heaviest shit.

339
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,620
And you pick them up and you
toss them around and throw them.

340
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,990
Really what you should
do is get a fucking job,

341
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:13,531
uh,

342
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:14,364
farm,

343
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,030
uh,

344
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,200
and work doing that all day.

345
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,430
He'd be strong as shit.

346
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,960
You ever tried to arm wrestle at farmer?

347
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,220
They will fuck you up.

348
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,350
That Joel Salitan guy that
we had on the podcast,

349
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:23,880
I bet that old man would fuck me up.

350
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,870
I bet if we arm wrestle,

351
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,100
but I kicked my ass.

352
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,990
They throw hay bales
around all day and shit.

353
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:29,370
But if you don't have time for Hay Bales,

354
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,061
you can,

355
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:30,300
uh,

356
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,290
get it all done.

357
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,620
Uh,

358
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:31,981
with,

359
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:32,161
uh,

360
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:32,521
the,

361
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:32,700
uh,

362
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,720
Onnit steel bells.

363
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,450
I'm a big fan of the medicine balls.

364
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:39,690
I've really only worked out with the
primal steel belt once and that was when I

365
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:40,524
was at on it,

366
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,330
but I could see a big benefit in it.

367
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:43,950
It's also awkward to pick up,

368
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:44,131
you know,

369
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:45,510
when you're picking up
one of these things,

370
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,480
it's not like picking up a
weight shifts and moves around.

371
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,650
And the idea is that it
sort of mimics real work.

372
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,900
So it's good for like a conditioning
workout as you want to do something that

373
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:57,400
really like ups,

374
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,080
you're a ups your cardio,

375
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:03,700
just pick this up and slamming on the
ground like 150 times you'd be fucking

376
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:06,820
exhausted and a bunch of
different exercises that you
can find with these things

377
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:07,810
to really,

378
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:08,200
uh,

379
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
it's Kinda cool.

380
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,700
Um,

381
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,030
there's,

382
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,280
we have a video of a bunch of them,

383
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:12,700
uh,

384
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,310
at on it and we also have a,

385
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,520
a workout section at on it that you
can go to for all the different,

386
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,570
um,

387
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:19,901
uh,

388
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,380
workout equipment like the steel bells,

389
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,680
w kettlebells.

390
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:27,250
We have a new video that Aubrey and
I did where we were talking about our

391
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:28,480
favorite exercises show,

392
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,390
some alternating cleans and
a bunch of different things.

393
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:33,670
We're going to put these
out as as much as possible.

394
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,660
Um,

395
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,100
one important point though,

396
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,320
if you're going to do anything like this,

397
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,880
if you haven't done it,

398
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:43,000
if you don't have a background
in strength and conditioning,

399
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,620
if you don't have a
background in exercise,

400
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:48,190
police start slowly
concentrating on the proper form.

401
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,820
If you can film yourself and compare
yourself to the way other people are doing

402
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:54,160
it in videos to make sure that
you're doing it correctly,

403
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,750
if you really can,

404
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,870
the the really the best
move is to get a trainer.

405
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,960
Get someone who can even
just for one workout,

406
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,470
show you how to do it correctly so
that you're not fucking yourself up.

407
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,190
You can work out safe and and
efficiently with this stuff,

408
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,680
but you really want to make
sure that you do it correctly.

409
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:12,430
To do so.

410
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:12,701
All right,

411
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:13,690
go to [inaudible] Dot Com o.

412
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:14,171
N N.

413
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:17,950
I t used the Codeword Rogan and save
10% off any and all supplements.

414
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,430
Right.

415
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,990
Andrea [inaudible],

416
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:25,090
our policies here and we are going to
learn more than we did before about the

417
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:27,370
wonderful powers of the bitcoin

418
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,010
pitch out Rogan experience.

419
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,230
Joe Rogan podcast.

420
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,943
Boom.

421
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,603
How are you sir?

422
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,750
I'm doing great.

423
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,070
Great to have you back again,

424
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:43,311
man.

425
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:46,160
It was fun having you on
before and a lot of feedback.

426
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,570
A lot of people learned a lot about crypto
currencies and the benefits of them,

427
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:51,590
what's going on,

428
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:52,321
what were the,

429
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:56,360
the pushes where the negative things
are and put a little balance to a lot of

430
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:59,780
the negative press that you hear about
bitcoin and all these different various

431
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,950
cryptocurrencies in the media
because that's literally all I hear.

432
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,220
Yeah,

433
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,461
I mean,

434
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:06,680
I know people are trading
things back and forth,

435
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:09,320
but you really put it
into perspective for us,

436
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,820
especially when you were talking about
that what was $150 million transaction as

437
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:15,920
I was the one that was
done through bitcoin.

438
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,080
When you start hearing things like that,

439
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:18,291
you go,

440
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:18,950
okay,

441
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,180
well there's some people out there that
have some serious fucking money and

442
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:24,440
they're banking on this.

443
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,260
They're throwing their
chips in this corner,

444
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,450
at least some of them
to see what's going on.

445
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,830
And I guess the idea is if
it's worth $150 million today,

446
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,890
who fucking knows what it
would be worth in five years?

447
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,970
That's the big gamble,

448
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:38,560
right?

449
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,010
Yeah.

450
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,281
Yeah,

451
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:39,551
it is.

452
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:39,980
But I,

453
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,390
I,

454
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,700
I think it's important not to
look at it as an investment.

455
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,063
Um,

456
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,320
it's so much more interesting as a means
of exchange than as a store of value.

457
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,673
It's,

458
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,980
it can do amazing things

459
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,060
in terms of velocity,

460
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,070
just getting money from
one place to another,

461
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,960
and it's not about the big movements.

462
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,300
What's even more fascinating
as the small moments?

463
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:00,134
So for example,

464
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,670
I take tips on Twitter and
without knowing these people,

465
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:06,560
they can send me a quarter,

466
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,030
like 25 cents or 10 cents
over Twitter instantly.

467
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,330
And you can't even do that with any
other payments system because it costs so

468
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,350
much to move money.

469
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,450
And it enables all of these little tiny,

470
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,800
tiny transactions,

471
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,970
um,

472
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:20,803
and they add up,

473
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,460
you know,

474
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,040
uh,

475
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,970
and it's fun to,

476
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:24,710
to be able to connect
with people that way.

477
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,810
And it's direct unlike say like a paypal
situation where you have to give them a

478
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:29,710
piece of the action.

479
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:30,431
Yeah.

480
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:30,971
Not just that.

481
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:31,320
I mean,

482
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,330
it requires no prior
arrangements of any kind.

483
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,010
They don't need to create an account.

484
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:37,390
I don't need to create an account.

485
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:39,820
I can just put up my bitcoin
address as harvest saving things.

486
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,920
Now if you pay taxes on Bitcoin,

487
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,401
does,

488
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:42,821
does it,

489
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:43,091
I mean,

490
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:45,520
how do you sort it out
over the course of a year?

491
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:45,990
Because the,

492
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,210
the,

493
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,380
the dollar value of it goes up and down.

494
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:50,800
Yeah.

495
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,060
So how do you figure out,

496
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:53,200
like when you make taxes,

497
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,060
do you do it at the current rate,

498
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,560
the day you file it?

499
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,071
I mean,

500
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:57,904
how do you do that?

501
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:58,960
Um,

502
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,291
well,

503
00:15:59,291 --> 00:15:59,620
we're,

504
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,131
first of all,

505
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:01,510
we're still trying to figure that out.

506
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,870
It's been about a month since the IRS
released some information on how they want

507
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:07,691
to tax it.

508
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:09,130
Then they were taxing it like a commodity,

509
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:10,330
which means capital gains.

510
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:11,020
So,

511
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,380
um,

512
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,230
you have to account for the price when
you bought it and then the price when you

513
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:16,360
sold it and then look at the difference.

514
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:17,230
And if you gained you,

515
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,300
you pay tax on capital gains tax on the,

516
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,193
and if you lost you,

517
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,150
you can account for capital losses.

518
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,370
That seems like if people were smart,

519
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:26,150
they would buy up a shit load of Bitcoin,

520
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,790
then sell like right before and fucking
crash the market and then pay their

521
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:34,570
taxes and then buy and then
you'd fucking just keep winning.

522
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:34,981
Yeah.

523
00:16:34,981 --> 00:16:38,160
The market's big enough that you can't
really play those kinds of games.

524
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,010
Dude always think it's
going to get complicated.

525
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,860
Is that a possibility?

526
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:44,490
Could you do that?

527
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,620
And did I just violate the law?

528
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,080
No,

529
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,500
the insider trading never confused

530
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,120
the,

531
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,953
the markets,

532
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,360
the markets pretty huge right now.

533
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:54,194
So the,

534
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,490
on a daily basis,

535
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:55,820
uh,

536
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,770
tens of thousands of big coin move around.

537
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:02,540
So unless you were able to
bring a very big amount of air,

538
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,650
you can't really do that.

539
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:05,780
You can't move these markets artificially.

540
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,860
You'd have to be like some Bill
Gates type character to do that and,

541
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,090
and uh,

542
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,050
it would be difficult.

543
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:13,760
There are far more liquid
markets to do that.

544
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:13,941
You know,

545
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:14,950
if you want to play games like that,

546
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,870
go play them on s and s and
p 500 with front running,

547
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:18,950
high frequency trading.

548
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,121
That's what's going on.

549
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:21,680
That's where the big
games are being played.

550
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:22,670
This is small stuff.

551
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,600
They have to make the
stock market illegal.

552
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,120
They really do the shits.

553
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:26,580
Yeah.

554
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,180
You've got a good point too about saying
that it's important to not look at it

555
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:34,620
as an investment because there's some
kind of gross about those kinds of

556
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:35,454
investments.

557
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,890
Like when you find out about
somebody got in on a stock early,

558
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,040
like some tech company and then
it may like 300 million bucks,

559
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,450
like for no fucking reason.

560
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,261
And then you're like,

561
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:44,094
wait a minute,

562
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,403
what'd you do?

563
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,880
Where's that money coming from?

564
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,710
I don't get it.

565
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,340
It's way too volatile.

566
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,150
Um,

567
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,920
because it's,

568
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,310
it's a growing technology.

569
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:55,230
It's a brand new technology
is still being tested.

570
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:56,340
It's way too volatile.

571
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,410
And for the average investor,

572
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,580
that means it's way too risky.

573
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,110
Now there are some investors,

574
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:05,520
sophisticated investors who have a broad
portfolio and who may want to take a

575
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:10,521
small part of that portfolio and put it
into a very high volatility investment

576
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:13,080
in order to churn some returns out.

577
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,790
But they would do that's in a very,

578
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,480
uh,

579
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,390
knowing exactly how much
risk they're taking,

580
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:22,890
which is a lot and balancing out
that risk over big afford a folio.

581
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,840
But your average person,

582
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,111
no,

583
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:27,750
this is definitely not the kind of
thing you want to be playing with.

584
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,030
Use it to do transactions,

585
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,530
hold it for long term playing with
this market will only get you burned.

586
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,151
There's this,

587
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:40,290
there's this real temptation to
try to day trade this market.

588
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,011
Uh,

589
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:43,050
and a lot of people fall
for that temptation.

590
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,840
I played with it when I
first started with bitcoin.

591
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,750
It was learned that lesson pretty fast.

592
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,600
So you're,

593
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,770
if you're day trading,

594
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,001
exactly.

595
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:53,080
How would you work that out?

596
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,110
You would say you'd buy up a bunch of
bitcoin and then when the price hit a

597
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,890
significant margin,

598
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:01,930
like if it got to a high
enough level you like,

599
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:02,710
you know what,

600
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,880
I think we just hit the lid,

601
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,590
sell that shit and then you sell it.

602
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,360
Yeah,

603
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,811
buy low,

604
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:07,470
sell high,

605
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,303
it's cool.

606
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,810
But the problem is you never know where
highest and you never know where low

607
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:12,141
isn't it?

608
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:16,940
Most people essentially end up falling
for the basic psychology of panic and

609
00:19:16,941 --> 00:19:21,941
greed and so they end up actually buying
high because of greed and selling low

610
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:25,520
because of panic and then they end up
flipping that equation and losing a lot of

611
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:26,030
money.

612
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,780
Don't do it.

613
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,220
I mean it's really not worth it.

614
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,590
This is a very interesting technology.

615
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,580
Treating it like a penny
stock and trying to,

616
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,840
we make money off it
will only get you burned.

617
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,690
Well spoken is a true believer.

618
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,510
I agree with you on that and I
think that's cool that you uh,

619
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,553
you stressed that.

620
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,570
What I keep hearing about this Mt.

621
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,650
Gox monkey in the news,

622
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:44,891
man.

623
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:46,480
This guy is constantly in the news.

624
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,160
What are they going to do with that dude?

625
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,390
And for folks who don't know,

626
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,321
explain,

627
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:52,090
if they haven't heard
the earlier podcasts,

628
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,380
explain what this,

629
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:53,740
uh,

630
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,210
Mt Gox situation is.

631
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,530
So first of all,

632
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,364
there's no mountain.

633
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,263
Uh,

634
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,650
here's the interesting story.

635
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:05,510
This started out as a trading site for
a cards for playing cards called magic,

636
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:07,070
the gathering online exchange,

637
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,280
which everybody knows and no
offense to magic the gathering fans,

638
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
you guys are fucking dorks.

639
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:12,591
Okay?

640
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:13,430
There's no offense,

641
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,211
no offense,

642
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:15,044
I'm a dork too.

643
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,610
There's a lot of dorkiness too.

644
00:20:16,611 --> 00:20:17,930
A lot of things that I enjoy.

645
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:18,290
Yeah,

646
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,420
but you guys are fucking serious dorks.

647
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,490
And that was the basis
for the original Mt.

648
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,260
Gox site and the domain at least.

649
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:27,681
Yes.

650
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:31,040
And then it became this exchange,

651
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,410
one of the biggest exchanges
in the world for Bitcoin,

652
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:34,940
but not secure,

653
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,590
not coded properly,

654
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,693
just a wreck.

655
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:38,461
Well,

656
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:39,294
the thing is,

657
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,750
um,

658
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,470
Mt.

659
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,850
Gox is I like to call it a,

660
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:44,010
which kind of rhymes with Mt.

661
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,330
Gox.

662
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:44,930
Um,

663
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,560
because it really is just an acronym.

664
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:47,394
It's not a,

665
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,423
um,

666
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,610
it started off as a trading site and it
offered something really important and

667
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:55,324
valuable.

668
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,840
In the early days of Bitcoin when you
were trading locally among individuals,

669
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,460
there was no price discovery mechanism.

670
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:03,430
There was no way to figure out how much
a big coin was worth because there was

671
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:04,330
no liquid market.

672
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,231
So,

673
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:05,501
you know,

674
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:05,921
if I,

675
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:07,570
if I bought some bitcoin from you,

676
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:11,290
we have to figure out what price we were
both comfortable with and maybe we'd

677
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,120
ask somebody else to,

678
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,251
well,

679
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:13,630
how much did you buy it for?

680
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,100
And that's how you discover the price,

681
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:15,400
right?

682
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,430
Because if there isn't a
really big liquid market,

683
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,720
you don't know what the prices,

684
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,800
was it more stable then?

685
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:21,881
No,

686
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,541
it was a,

687
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,660
it was a even more volatile
because keep in mind at the time,

688
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,220
bitcoin was trading for,

689
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,180
uh,

690
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,850
thousands of a penny a or pennies.

691
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,180
So you could basically buy a thousand
bitcoin for a dollar and you're really

692
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,020
tastes

693
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,500
wow.

694
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,000
And that would be worth what,

695
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:39,200
like a hundred grand now
or something close to it.

696
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:39,890
All right,

697
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,250
that wouldn't be worth
half a million dollars.

698
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:41,760
Now.

699
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,810
Half a million.

700
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,331
Well,

701
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:43,651
wow.

702
00:21:43,651 --> 00:21:45,150
I'm so behind the price.

703
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:45,690
Yeah.

704
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,280
What is the price of 501?

705
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:47,760
No.

706
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:47,851
Oh,

707
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:48,960
it's 500 bucks now.

708
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,380
Yeah.

709
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,760
Wow.

710
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,380
I was way off as the thing goes.

711
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,223
300 something.

712
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:52,590
I,

713
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:52,921
yeah,

714
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:56,430
I really wasn't sure between down what's
the lowest it's been like in recent

715
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:57,264
times.

716
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,681
Um,

717
00:21:58,681 --> 00:21:59,730
so last year,

718
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,530
this time it jumped from about a hundred
to two 66 and then dropped again down

719
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,364
to 50.

720
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:05,910
Um,

721
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,190
so at some point last year it was 50,

722
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,421
and then,

723
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:09,800
uh,

724
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,040
in the meantime it's 500.

725
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,220
Then it went all the way
up to about a thousand,

726
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,990
maybe 1100 on some markets,

727
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,870
and then it dumped all
the way down to 800.

728
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:19,681
Stayed there for a bit,

729
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:21,640
and then it dumped all
the way down to 500.

730
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:25,260
And then it had a brief
period flirting with three 70,

731
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,610
and then it went back up.

732
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,180
I mean,

733
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,380
so here's what's happening.

734
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,400
Um,

735
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,031
every couple,

736
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:30,870
every few weeks.

737
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,770
Um,

738
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:35,250
China started back in April of last year.

739
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,780
The China market opened up in,

740
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,051
oh,

741
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:37,331
sorry.

742
00:22:37,331 --> 00:22:38,400
In November of last year,

743
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,060
the China market opened
up and everyone's like,

744
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:40,760
yeah,

745
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,930
China's in bit coin to the moon.

746
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,280
The price shut up.

747
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,330
Ah,

748
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,020
interesting.

749
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,950
And then China said,

750
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,740
we're thinking of banding it
and the price crashes and then,

751
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,110
but maybe we won't baton
it to the price rises,

752
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,790
but maybe we'll ban it's and then the
price crashes and we've been playing this,

753
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,891
is it band?

754
00:22:57,891 --> 00:22:58,691
Is it not band?

755
00:22:58,691 --> 00:22:59,281
Does it pans?

756
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:04,281
Is it not band for the last five months
and it's been a rollercoaster and in the

757
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,030
end or it really doesn't matter.

758
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:06,850
I mean,

759
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,040
so for folks who don't know
what we're talking about,

760
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:14,630
this Mt Gox thing was this online exchange
that it turned out someone somehow,

761
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,890
whether it was an inside job or not,

762
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,740
someone somehow was stealing money
to the tune of hundreds of millions

763
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,351
took all of it.

764
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:25,430
The bitcoin took all of the
money and they change 100% of it.

765
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,640
Well like 85 90% of it.

766
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,450
Oh my God.

767
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,890
So someone somewhere stole
an insane amount of money,

768
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,480
but you're not hearing about some
wild man hunt to get to that money.

769
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:39,314
If it was like,

770
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,510
there was a guy named Lee Marie all right.

771
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:46,340
And Lee Marie was a mixed martial arts
fighter from the UK who is a real crazy

772
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:46,970
man.

773
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,530
He was like as white as they come.

774
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:52,970
He was like a real live version of a
character from a Guy Ritchie movie guy was

775
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:53,510
nuts.

776
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,680
He fought in the UFC.

777
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:58,160
It was a really good fighter to
fought Anderson Silva and cage rage.

778
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:59,720
I mean high level guy.

779
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,093
Um,

780
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,560
and he was also a fucking thug,

781
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:08,580
like super legit criminal and he was a
part of a huge multimillion dollar bank

782
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:15,971
heist where they came in with fucking
ski masks and bulletproof vests and,

783
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:17,120
and you know,

784
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,380
high powered rifles and machine
guns though the full deal,

785
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:22,730
like full black ops,

786
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,330
like,

787
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,163
like a movie.

788
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,010
And they,

789
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,430
I mean they have the security cameras
with these guys and then somehow or

790
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:30,020
another they all got nabbed.

791
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,220
And uh,

792
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,053
this guy,

793
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,500
Lee Marie was a,

794
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,240
one of the ones they
chased after the hardest.

795
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:38,360
He went to Morocco and he was hiding
there and they got arrested there for,

796
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,290
he got arrested there for like kidnapping
someone a beaten him like after he did

797
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,130
the bank job.

798
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,660
I mean this guy's a fucking maniac,

799
00:24:44,661 --> 00:24:45,390
right?

800
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:45,590
Uh,

801
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,490
but the point is there
was a fucking man hunt.

802
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:51,740
It was all over the newspapers in the UK.

803
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:52,730
It was everywhere.

804
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,830
They were going after these motherfuckers.

805
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,840
And it seems to me like the amount
of money that was stolen in Mt.

806
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,100
Gox is commensurate

807
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,840
to this or it's bigger,

808
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,680
bigger,

809
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:03,921
but,

810
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:04,370
but here's,

811
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:04,820
here's the,

812
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,653
is it really bigger?

813
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,051
Yeah.

814
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:06,884
I think how much are they?

815
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,450
How much was the UK Bank?

816
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,290
Let me find out.

817
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,900
Nobody knows exactly
how much is gone at Cox,

818
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:14,090
but it's somewhere between
six and 800 million.

819
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:14,751
All my God,

820
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:15,584
it is bigger.

821
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,700
But here's the thing,

822
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,170
Bernie Madoff stole $20 billion,

823
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,360
20 billion with a B and there wasn't a
man hunt there because the real truth is

824
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:30,080
that if you want to rob a bank,

825
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:33,470
what you do is you go
get a banking license.

826
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,750
Thank you for all of the bank using
a keyboard instead of a machine gun.

827
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:42,260
No one starts a man hunt that way.

828
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,220
Um,

829
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,440
that's the modern way of
doing bank heists and,

830
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:50,630
and that's the way that doesn't get you
a shot and nets you the biggest return.

831
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,001
Well,

832
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:52,350
when you're a crazy criminal though,

833
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,960
and you don't know how
to work keyboard fat,

834
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,361
well,

835
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:54,481
I mean,

836
00:25:54,481 --> 00:25:55,314
you gotta be Italy.

837
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,610
You gotta be El three,

838
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:57,444
three t,

839
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,423
right?

840
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,520
Pull that shit off.

841
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,800
So this Mt Gox thing.

842
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,500
Someone somewhere has stolen,

843
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,060
let's put a number on it.

844
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,560
You say $800 million.

845
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:07,950
No,

846
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,660
nobody knows that.

847
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,560
I was just saying $100 million.

848
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:11,940
It's somewhere between five and eight,

849
00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:12,430
I think.

850
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,400
Let's just say it's $100 million.

851
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,360
Several hundred million dollars derivative
and say it's $100 million from the

852
00:26:18,361 --> 00:26:20,700
current at the current bitcoin price.

853
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,630
Yeah.

854
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:25,980
If someone stole a hundred fucking
million dollars worth of money,

855
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,620
like if $100 million worth
of diamonds went missing,

856
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,340
what a man hunt there would be for that,

857
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,520
but something like that or,

858
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,180
or stolen and go missing
in the banking system.

859
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,180
And in government affairs all the time.

860
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,290
And there was no man hunt.

861
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,900
I mean this is fairly
typical of what happens.

862
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,913
These are white collar.

863
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,070
It's about

864
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,090
records and forensic accounting and
analysis and drawn out cases where they

865
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:49,350
tried to figure out what happened.

866
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,680
The bottom line is every year about a
hundred or more banks fail spectacularly

867
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,900
and the money disappears.

868
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,330
And this was just another bank failure.

869
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,780
It really had very little
to do with bitcoin.

870
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,840
It was a bank failure of
the very traditional kinds.

871
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:12,110
This was not a system that's used
bitcoin to protect its security.

872
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:16,170
It was a systems that collected all
of the bitcoin and one big account,

873
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,220
uh,

874
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,270
and then lost that.

875
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,770
So it's essentially,

876
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,160
um,

877
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,290
the account was robbed in the account,

878
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,930
just happened to be holding bitcoin.

879
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:25,590
Yeah.

880
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,640
And actually the dollar
dollars dollar's had gone to

881
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,950
the currency accounts
in the banks were also,

882
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,910
um,

883
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,800
how much was that?

884
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,471
Their dollars?

885
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:35,400
Some dollars missing.

886
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:35,791
I don't know.

887
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:39,840
It was a lot less money to man.

888
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,950
It was a few million.

889
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,290
It was a few million or
maybe tens of millions,

890
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:43,521
but,

891
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:45,060
but it wasn't like hundreds.

892
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,223
So,

893
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,160
yeah,

894
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,150
here's the thing,

895
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,010
like,

896
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,740
um,

897
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,970
you have a bitcoin wallet,

898
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:51,804
right?

899
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,400
That means you control the keys.

900
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,460
And that's the essence of Bitcoin
is that individual's control them.

901
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:57,900
They don't have a bank,

902
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,950
they don't have their money in a bank
where someone else has custody of it and

903
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:05,520
then they just have a little IOU note
that says you have this much in the bank

904
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:08,640
and maybe we'll give it to you when
you come to was my next question.

905
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,630
So Gox did not have individual account
bitcoin accounts for the users.

906
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,780
They took the bitcoin and then put it
all into one of their own accounts and,

907
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,123
and managed it.

908
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,060
So they took it out all of the security
of each person having their own keys and

909
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:27,120
instead collected all the
money in one vague wallet.

910
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:27,780
Wow,

911
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,620
that's crazy.

912
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:29,520
Why would they do that?

913
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,720
What's the benefit of that?

914
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,430
Well,

915
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,263
um,

916
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:38,250
there's this instinct to implement
the same types of centralized banking

917
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:38,941
institutions.

918
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:39,571
And here's the thing.

919
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:44,250
When you have that much money under
the control of an individual on an

920
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,150
organization,

921
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,570
society then builds all of
these regulatory institutions
because they figured

922
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:51,750
out that when you do that,

923
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,850
those institutions,

924
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:55,080
those organizations,

925
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:57,810
those individuals steal
the money again and again.

926
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,910
When you put one person
in charge of the money,

927
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,020
they steal the money.

928
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,180
That's what power corrupts.

929
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,070
Absolute power corrupts absolutely,

930
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:08,100
and there is no more powerful
corrupting influence than money.

931
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:11,400
So when you have people who
have millions in their control,

932
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:12,810
bad things happen.

933
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:14,190
Someone just fucks off with it.

934
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:17,910
They just figured out a way to do it right
or they're sloppy with their security

935
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:19,140
and somebody else robs them.

936
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,400
But in either case,

937
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,530
all of the banking regulations we have
are to stop the fact that individual's

938
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,720
control too much money
from stealing that money.

939
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,430
Bitcoin is a different solution.

940
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:33,120
The idea is instead of collecting
all the money in one big bucket,

941
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,690
you have each user
controlling their own money.

942
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,800
You don't put it in a bank,

943
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:39,630
you don't concentrate the risk.

944
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,040
And that way you don't need all of

945
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,850
these elaborate controls because you
don't take the control of the money away

946
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:46,670
from the individual.

947
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,610
You leave it in the
hands of the individuals.

948
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:48,941
Well,

949
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:49,540
Mt.

950
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,250
Gox took it away of the
control of the individuals,

951
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:55,060
but then didn't have any of the regulatory
institutions that we traditionally

952
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:55,894
have in banking,

953
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,710
so they weren't using the bitcoin
security and there weren't using the

954
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:02,500
traditional banking regulations
and audits to protect them.

955
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,070
They were in this gray area in between
where they had all of the control over

956
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,050
the money and none of the protections.

957
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,700
What the fuck?

958
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,230
That's ridiculous.

959
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,440
That is a vending competence as well.

960
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,820
I mean like really,

961
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:20,770
really bad management
of really bad coding.

962
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,420
Really bad technology use.

963
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:26,470
Just gross and competence
of an unbelievable scale.

964
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,290
I mean you'd think with all of that
money they'd hire some competent people,

965
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,540
but the incompetent started at the top.

966
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:31,961
Well,

967
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:34,510
you look at the guy at the
top and has dumped fat face.

968
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,890
Look at that fucking dummy.

969
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,091
Look at that.

970
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:38,680
That guy's never been good at anything.

971
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,930
I'll tell you why right now,

972
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,240
God was a dump fat face like that.

973
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:42,481
I said,

974
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:44,190
if you have a dumb fat
face and you're smart,

975
00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:45,060
I apologize.

976
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,470
Apologize Right now.

977
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
I have a dumb face to,

978
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:48,620
oh,

979
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,251
he plays magic.

980
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:49,840
The gathering.

981
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,080
Yeah.

982
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,020
Well he doesn't just play it.

983
00:30:51,021 --> 00:30:52,820
He owns a fucking online exchange.

984
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:53,511
Well,

985
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:54,710
he actually bought it from someone else.

986
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,910
How much do you pay for it?

987
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,091
I,

988
00:30:56,091 --> 00:30:56,571
I don't know.

989
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:56,781
I mean,

990
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:57,620
there was some kind of,

991
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,750
this goes way back in the early days,

992
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,793
but here's the thing,

993
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,060
Mark Kurt Palace to the guy
you just showed in that photo,

994
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,230
let's call big fat face.

995
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,263
Can we cut?

996
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,390
Sure.

997
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:08,780
Um,

998
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,360
so I don't,

999
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,310
I don't know him personally.

1000
00:31:10,311 --> 00:31:10,971
I've never met him,

1001
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:15,860
but he provided a really critical service
at a time when bitcoin desperately

1002
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:16,281
needed it.

1003
00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:20,750
He provided a market where people could
buy and sell bitcoin in a transparent

1004
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:21,584
way.

1005
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,710
And for the first time
you had bitcoin pricing,

1006
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:28,070
you could figure out how much a bitcoin
was worth because there were lots of

1007
00:31:28,071 --> 00:31:28,791
people trading it.

1008
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:33,470
And therefore the price that they settled
on over thousands of trades was priced

1009
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:33,921
discovery.

1010
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:34,151
You,

1011
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:35,900
you need that to the market to function.

1012
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,910
So now you had a price and for many
years the Mt Gox price was the price of

1013
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:41,744
bitcoin.

1014
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,490
Um,

1015
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:42,801
all right,

1016
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:44,690
so we'll stop calling them big fat face,

1017
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,790
but then let's call poor bastard.

1018
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,653
Okay.

1019
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,410
So poor bastard starts out good.

1020
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,340
It starts out good,

1021
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,210
everything's going great.

1022
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:56,620
He helps out a lot of people by
letting them establish a price.

1023
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:56,981
Yeah.

1024
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,020
Which we made a huge
difference for bitcoin.

1025
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:01,510
I mean there was the first time you
had a liquid market where people could

1026
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:03,520
actually trade knots just face to face,

1027
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,180
but,

1028
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,850
but could exchange of various
currencies for bitcoin.

1029
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,890
And that was incredibly important without,

1030
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,180
without Mt.

1031
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,370
Gox

1032
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,420
so he's essentially,

1033
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:16,250
this is just a symptom of a growing
market that he just wasn't prepared for.

1034
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,550
Like as if like here's a perfect example.

1035
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,380
If I was running something,

1036
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,453
okay,

1037
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,570
I'm a dummy.

1038
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,040
Like when it comes to computers,

1039
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:25,910
I'm a real dummy.

1040
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:30,040
So if I was running some sort of online
exchange and somehow or another it

1041
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:32,110
started trading bitcoin and then I saw,

1042
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,340
started seeing hundreds
of millions of dollars,

1043
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:34,741
I would,

1044
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:36,140
I would have to bring people in.

1045
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,110
I would have to bring in
like financial experts,

1046
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,130
coding experts.

1047
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,120
I have to try to anywhere,

1048
00:32:41,121 --> 00:32:41,590
any experts,

1049
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:41,731
man,

1050
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:42,890
I'm busy as fuck man.

1051
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,300
I wouldn't probably do it right.

1052
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,960
I would probably fuck it up just
the way poor bastard fucked it up.

1053
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,040
Yeah.

1054
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,560
So can't really blame him
except he's got his finger out.

1055
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,100
Well,

1056
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,933
here's the thing.

1057
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,260
Fuck you back buddy.

1058
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,760
There's a chance,

1059
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:56,720
you know,

1060
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,720
we don't know if this was just gross
waste management or also fraud.

1061
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,130
I'm not gonna go as far as say poor
bastard because there's a good chance that

1062
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:08,330
he heard,

1063
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,850
he heard a lot of people
very badly and there's a,

1064
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:12,410
there's a chance that he was culpable.

1065
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,610
Big Fat face,

1066
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:14,660
you will find out.

1067
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,530
But,

1068
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,670
but at the same time,

1069
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,000
it's a classic story of someone who,

1070
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,153
um,

1071
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,440
was in a situation that was way over their
head and then they tried to handle it

1072
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:28,340
without asking for help.

1073
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,600
And then it snowballed and they tried
to cover up some mistakes by trying to

1074
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:33,290
cover up,

1075
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:37,310
by making bigger mistakes and then
bigger mistakes and then bigger mistakes.

1076
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,420
How did you try to cover it up?

1077
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,171
Well,

1078
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:39,591
once,

1079
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:40,130
uh,

1080
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:45,130
so some money was taken in an earlier
incident from the system and then I think

1081
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:53,381
he tried to cover up the lack of money
by essentially generating more fees from,

1082
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:54,350
from the customers.

1083
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,400
Um,

1084
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,121
and you know,

1085
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:59,870
paying for the previous loss by bringing
in new customers and trying to stay

1086
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,190
ahead of the loss,

1087
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,480
which by the way,

1088
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:02,930
you've seen,

1089
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,130
we've seen this again and again,

1090
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:05,270
it's a Bernie Madoff movie.

1091
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,310
Essentially it was running
a mini pyramid scheme,

1092
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,060
right.

1093
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,211
And,

1094
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:12,350
and Pyramid Scheme pyramid schemes
are very rarely intentional.

1095
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,510
Nobody starts out to Sam
going to run a pyramid scheme.

1096
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,070
What happens is they take a bat,

1097
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,220
they lose on that bet and then they tried
to cover up the fact that they lost by

1098
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:21,020
bringing in more people and the like,

1099
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,220
as long as I stay ahead of this,

1100
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:23,120
it's not going to bite me.

1101
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,710
And then it gets bigger and bigger.

1102
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,200
We saw that with that trader in,

1103
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,040
um,

1104
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,860
I think it was a one of the Swiss banks,

1105
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:31,880
um,

1106
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,300
who was,

1107
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,710
who was essentially trading bigger and
bigger bets in order to cover up previous

1108
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:40,850
mistakes and getting further out
until eventually it all collapsed.

1109
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,950
And we've seen this
happen again and again.

1110
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,270
It's really trying to cover up an early
mistake by making a bigger mistake.

1111
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,620
And then it snowballs.

1112
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,340
Well,

1113
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,680
I have seen legit pyramid schemes.

1114
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:54,110
I had a guy who was a
coach at a boxing gym,

1115
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,000
tried to talk me into a pyramid scheme.

1116
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,760
I mean he was describing
it in the dumbest way ever.

1117
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:00,470
He was describing a pyramid scheme.

1118
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,950
He's like a bunch of people
put the money in and then a,

1119
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:04,161
hey,

1120
00:35:04,161 --> 00:35:04,731
I got money.

1121
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:04,960
Oh,

1122
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,440
that's how I got these rooms on my truck.

1123
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:07,281
And I was like,

1124
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:08,150
what are you doing?

1125
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:08,751
He's like,

1126
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:08,871
you,

1127
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:09,621
you invest,

1128
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:09,771
you know,

1129
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:12,410
you put money in the new
people come in and then,

1130
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:12,621
you know,

1131
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:14,160
you could take money out
of the new people coming.

1132
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,361
I go,

1133
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:15,194
it's a pyramid scheme.

1134
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,453
Do you know what you're saying?

1135
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,031
He's like,

1136
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,350
he didn't know what a pyramid scheme was.

1137
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:18,890
Well,

1138
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,310
um,

1139
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,030
I learned that lesson in seventh grade.

1140
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:23,541
Yeah,

1141
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:24,374
it's a very,

1142
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,930
my school buddies were
running a little um,

1143
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,450
candy permit scheme,

1144
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,890
a candy Perez.

1145
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:32,720
Basically it was candy was um,

1146
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:33,831
what do you call it?

1147
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:34,664
Like the,

1148
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,920
we had one of those uh,

1149
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,010
cantinas where you

1150
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,990
could buy doughnuts and things like that.

1151
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,380
So it was kind of like a doughnut.

1152
00:35:41,381 --> 00:35:44,040
It's a pyramid scheme based on
the school canteen that wears.

1153
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,610
Um,

1154
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:44,910
but,

1155
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,620
but they actually drew it on the,

1156
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,620
on the blackboard as a,

1157
00:35:49,621 --> 00:35:53,820
as an airplane where you sit at the front
and then two people sit behind you and

1158
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:55,410
then four people sit behind you.

1159
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,180
And then it was kind of like,

1160
00:35:57,181 --> 00:36:01,080
it was called the airplane and it was
basically a permit scheme that some kid

1161
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:03,780
had heard from somewhere and
introduced into the class.

1162
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,730
And then our teacher sat us down and said,

1163
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:08,850
this is what a pyramid scheme is and
this is why you're not allowed to do this

1164
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:09,684
in the school.

1165
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,950
Does he does it to see what you'd want
to like find out where that guy is now of

1166
00:36:14,951 --> 00:36:19,951
even if he was doing that with candy
back then when I can creep in of Avon,

1167
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,210
I would like to send him a thank you
card or a real life financial education.

1168
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,170
I mean what a valuable lesson to learn
early and then not fall for it again.

1169
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,250
That is so true.

1170
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,340
Especially because you got
to see it in an actual form,

1171
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,670
not like some sort of abstract
lesson that's someone's teaching.

1172
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:38,170
You got to see it actually play out.

1173
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,260
PLO 800 people in the school.

1174
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,760
It fizzles out pretty quickly.

1175
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,100
You run out of soccer,

1176
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,280
soccer really,

1177
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:45,971
really fast.

1178
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:46,720
Right.

1179
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,870
So it only lasted

1180
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,090
I think about two weeks before the
whole thing came crashing down,

1181
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:51,270
but,

1182
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:55,260
but it was a fantastic demonstration
in real life in a closed controlled

1183
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:59,640
environments and the only losses were
really to the collapse of the local donuts

1184
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,474
economy.

1185
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,323
That's funny.

1186
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:01,960
My,

1187
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,100
the guy who came up to me,

1188
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,400
I explained to him that it was a pyramid
scheme and he still tried to sell me on

1189
00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:07,210
it.

1190
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:07,570
He's like,

1191
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:07,810
Yo,

1192
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:07,961
no,

1193
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:08,980
I'm telling you you should do it.

1194
00:37:08,981 --> 00:37:09,590
You should put your money.

1195
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:09,911
I'm like,

1196
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:10,870
what are you saying?

1197
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,230
Like did I just explained to you
what this is is a pyramid scheme.

1198
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,190
You know what a pyramid scheme is?

1199
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,930
Like people get ripped off,

1200
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,171
hey,

1201
00:37:17,171 --> 00:37:17,980
you're not going to get ripped off.

1202
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,520
Okay,

1203
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,353
I gotta go.

1204
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,193
Yeah,

1205
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:25,570
but this was a pyramid scheme almost
like just to cover up in competence and

1206
00:37:25,571 --> 00:37:30,400
then it sort of snowballed like a lie
that you couldn't help and then that lie,

1207
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,980
you might have got a bunch
of their lives to cover that.

1208
00:37:32,981 --> 00:37:34,910
La and then La.

1209
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:35,191
Well,

1210
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:35,671
keep in mind,

1211
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:36,391
I'm speculating,

1212
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:38,760
this is based on the
information we have right now.

1213
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:42,240
We've seen that there were a couple of
failures early on and then it seems like

1214
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:43,920
he was trying to cover up for those.

1215
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,463
We don't know yet.

1216
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:45,720
Right.

1217
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,880
This is only going to come out.

1218
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:48,410
He was a part of it as well.

1219
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:48,900
Right.

1220
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,630
We don't know how much was
stolen by outside people.

1221
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:51,990
Um,

1222
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,840
he certainly did try to cover losses,

1223
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,660
but we don't know if those losses
occurred because he lost a keys to,

1224
00:37:59,740 --> 00:37:59,970
to,

1225
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,920
to bitcoin and essentially lost the
money or if it was stolen or if it was

1226
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:06,750
embezzled or if it was whatever.

1227
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,063
We don't know.

1228
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:13,100
And there's now parallel prosecutions
happening both in Japan and in the United

1229
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,260
States to find the answers to that.

1230
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,250
Here's the interesting thing.

1231
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,540
We're going to find out the answers to
that because Bitcoin uses a public ledger

1232
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:26,600
and there's forensic evidence sprinkled
in the bitcoin transaction leisure that

1233
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:30,240
allows us to track exactly what happens.

1234
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,430
This is the most transparent
financial system.

1235
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:36,070
So we're going to get some
really interesting answers
so we'll be able to find

1236
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,903
out who has it.

1237
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,051
We,

1238
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:38,470
um,

1239
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,281
not really,

1240
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,040
but we're going to be able to find
out what happened and when it happens.

1241
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,251
I mean,

1242
00:38:42,251 --> 00:38:43,480
you'd just happened when it happened,

1243
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:45,940
but you can't find out where
it went and you can't track it.

1244
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,183
Right.

1245
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,020
Can,

1246
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,870
you can't track Ip
addresses through Bitcoin.

1247
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,920
You can or can't,

1248
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,401
cannot,

1249
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:52,000
cannot,

1250
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,833
cannot.

1251
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:53,171
No,

1252
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:53,731
you can't home.

1253
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,470
So there's no way to figure
out where that stuff went,

1254
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,580
where the bitcoins went.

1255
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,330
Not really.

1256
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,080
Not really.

1257
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,060
But you can see when it went out,

1258
00:39:01,061 --> 00:39:03,930
all of accounts that wouldn't
known to be controlled by Gox and,

1259
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,130
and so you can rebuild a timeline.

1260
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,840
Here's the other thing
that's not going to happen.

1261
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,040
Mt.

1262
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,090
Gox didn't get bailed out.

1263
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,393
Um,

1264
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,910
Mt.

1265
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,290
Gox didn't get 0% interest loans from a
central bank in order to pretend they're

1266
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:18,490
solvent when they're not.

1267
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:22,840
Mt Gox didn't make deals with other
banks to cover up their losses by

1268
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:25,060
collateralizing them in CDOS.

1269
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:25,721
Mt.

1270
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:29,020
Gox didn't get to acquire
some of the failing banks,

1271
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,520
add them to their asset
sheets and for them,

1272
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:31,990
pretend that they were not failing.

1273
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,920
Mt.

1274
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,390
Gox didn't gets to bail in all of the
customers of bitcoin across the entire

1275
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:38,224
economy.

1276
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,070
Mt.

1277
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:43,030
Gox didn't get too hyper inflate the
currency in order to save themselves,

1278
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:44,110
but destroy the economy.

1279
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:44,620
No.

1280
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,840
All of those things happened after 2008.

1281
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:47,591
Hold on a second.

1282
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:52,591
What you're saying sounds exactly
like what went on with our economy.

1283
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:54,304
Yeah.

1284
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,240
Oh,

1285
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:55,760
law.

1286
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,010
Wait a minute.

1287
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,230
Wait a minute.

1288
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,820
Does this guy in trouble?

1289
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:02,440
Oh yeah.

1290
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,040
Yeah.

1291
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,873
Where is he?

1292
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:04,210
It,

1293
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:04,990
he might,

1294
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,620
he might be,

1295
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,680
he might be one of the few
examples of banker's going to jail.

1296
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:09,790
Really?

1297
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,151
Yes.

1298
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:11,440
Which doesn't happen very often.

1299
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,970
It really happens in two cases.

1300
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,761
It happens.

1301
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:14,710
So the two,

1302
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:15,820
two small fish,

1303
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,420
uh,

1304
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,120
who can't get out of the book of Justice,

1305
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:19,870
him,

1306
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,950
the look of justice,

1307
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:21,340
I love it.

1308
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,860
Or A,

1309
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,600
it happens for those who
steal money from very,

1310
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:26,440
very rich people.

1311
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:27,310
Can't do that.

1312
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:28,510
Bernie Madoff didn't steal.

1313
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:31,330
I didn't steal millions
of mortgages from people.

1314
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,781
No,

1315
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:32,980
he stole money from very,

1316
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:33,641
very rich people.

1317
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:34,630
You can't get away with that.

1318
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:35,320
Uh,

1319
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,153
I see.

1320
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,060
Um,

1321
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,440
do you think that,

1322
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,090
is this guy in hiding?

1323
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,960
Like is he,

1324
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,381
no,

1325
00:40:41,381 --> 00:40:41,740
he's in,

1326
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,700
he's in Japan right now.

1327
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:44,260
There's a extradition requests.

1328
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,490
They know where he is.

1329
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,151
I believe so,

1330
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:46,301
yeah.

1331
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:47,710
How has no one killed him?

1332
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:48,431
I mean,

1333
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:51,080
you would think that this guy with
hundreds of millions of dollars,

1334
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,050
like every step that God takes,

1335
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,370
you must be looking over his shoulder.

1336
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,630
Does he still look like that?

1337
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,660
I would shave my head
and grow big tape beard.

1338
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,863
Yeah,

1339
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,210
free.

1340
00:40:59,210 --> 00:40:59,950
First of all,

1341
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,783
Japan,

1342
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,700
Japan has very,

1343
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,600
very few,

1344
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,030
very low incidences of violent crime.

1345
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,811
Uh,

1346
00:41:07,811 --> 00:41:10,030
there's not too many weapons around.

1347
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,160
The culture is not like that.

1348
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,600
And then the other culture,

1349
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,390
which is a well geeks like me,

1350
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,290
I mean,

1351
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:17,930
you know,

1352
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:18,763
um,

1353
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,350
I am trying to attack
someone and caused them harm.

1354
00:41:22,351 --> 00:41:27,160
I'd have to reach for an asthma inhaler
four times in the process of committing

1355
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:27,994
a crime.

1356
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,901
But it seems like a guy,

1357
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:32,050
like you could figure out a way
to code an APP for your phone.

1358
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:34,280
The controls are drone that shoots

1359
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,113
missiles.

1360
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,421
I mean,

1361
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:35,660
I would,

1362
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,110
I would think you'd see people like
you'd be the worst people to fuck.

1363
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:40,280
Not motivated enough.

1364
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:41,960
I Dunno,

1365
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,800
but you're not motivated.

1366
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:42,891
No,

1367
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:45,440
but you didn't lose hundreds
of millions of dollars is cat.

1368
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:50,450
Like what if you had $100 million in
that 800 plus whatever it was that

1369
00:41:50,451 --> 00:41:52,430
disappeared if $100 million,

1370
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,030
you know,

1371
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,430
whatever Poe plus or minus was all yours.

1372
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:55,711
You,

1373
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,130
it'd be fucking bloody furious.

1374
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,830
And there are a lot of people who
are very upset and very hurt by this

1375
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,550
situation.

1376
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,080
And a lot of people who
lost a lot of money,

1377
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:03,960
including a,

1378
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,270
it had a ripple effect.

1379
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,300
You've got to realize that many bitcoin
businesses had money in accounts there.

1380
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:11,630
Mm.

1381
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,620
So that loss then
affected the cashflow of,

1382
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,960
of other bitcoin businesses
that suffered and charities,

1383
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,260
many charities that lost money and,

1384
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,200
and Mt.

1385
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,310
Gox

1386
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:21,941
oh wow.

1387
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:26,260
So a business like say like a one that
I keep hearing about is tiger direct

1388
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,970
tiger directors is a pretty huge

1389
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,373
pewter company.

1390
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,140
overstock.com both of those hues.

1391
00:42:32,141 --> 00:42:32,500
Bitcoin.

1392
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:32,950
Yeah.

1393
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,430
Um,

1394
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,263
that's interesting.

1395
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:35,261
Overstock,

1396
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,760
keep hearing good things about overstock.

1397
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,010
Yeah.

1398
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,550
They generally don't have much
exposure because they don't,

1399
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,030
they,

1400
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:40,863
here's the thing,

1401
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,240
people who are using it as an exchange,

1402
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,490
so when you have excess bit coin,

1403
00:42:45,491 --> 00:42:46,520
move it in their self,

1404
00:42:46,521 --> 00:42:46,931
a dollars,

1405
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:47,860
move the dollars out.

1406
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,060
It just in and out.

1407
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:49,670
Right.

1408
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,900
The first is storing the
bitcoin there as a wallet,

1409
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,130
uh,

1410
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,760
and giving them full control of that
and just leaving piles of bitcoin there.

1411
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:02,800
Those were the ones most affected and
some of the day traders who had to have

1412
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,830
piles of bitcoin there so that
they could trade very quickly.

1413
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,600
Those were very affected.

1414
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,550
But people who just
moved money in and out,

1415
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,030
you know,

1416
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,770
maybe they lost that day's take.

1417
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,211
And,

1418
00:43:12,211 --> 00:43:13,100
and if you look at it,

1419
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,220
merchants like the ones you mentioned,

1420
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,120
uh,

1421
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,270
they don't leave stashes
of bitcoin around.

1422
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:20,050
They're going to exchange
that pretty quickly.

1423
00:43:20,051 --> 00:43:22,150
They're going to move out of
the exchange if they're smart.

1424
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,450
So they exchange it for
dollars and then they move.

1425
00:43:24,451 --> 00:43:25,080
Okay.

1426
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,501
Now,

1427
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:26,190
um,

1428
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:29,700
how much can you actually store
on your phone or your phone?

1429
00:43:29,701 --> 00:43:30,690
Like if you wanted a store,

1430
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,060
$1 million with the Bitcoin,

1431
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,180
could you put it on your phone?

1432
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,320
You could store $1
trillion worth of bitcoin.

1433
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:38,170
You could store whatever you want.

1434
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:38,441
I mean,

1435
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:40,150
there is no one in case
you lose your phone,

1436
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,380
Jesus fucking Christ.

1437
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:44,950
You'd have your phone connected to your
wrist and all wrapped around your waist

1438
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:45,784
with chains.

1439
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,161
Yeah,

1440
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:48,740
that would be a supremely
dumb and bad idea to do.

1441
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:51,370
But you can't make backups of Bitcoin,

1442
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,420
which you can't do with regular money.

1443
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,130
You can have multiple copies,

1444
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:56,810
you can encrypt those copies.

1445
00:43:56,811 --> 00:43:59,780
So you can do a lot of things to
protect yourself against loss.

1446
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,510
Can you have what you call it?

1447
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,740
Like can you have like your main wallet
and then like have like a sub wallet

1448
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,810
that hasn't completely different
like pass code or a way to get in?

1449
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,550
Yeah,

1450
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:10,280
that's right.

1451
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:10,491
Yeah.

1452
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:13,640
You can actually make a whole
tree structure of wallets.

1453
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,840
So why didn't like this,

1454
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:15,680
this company,

1455
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:17,550
this mk or whatever it's called to God,

1456
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,000
why didn't they just have
a shitload of sub wallets,

1457
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:20,720
you know,

1458
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,930
to protect each individual user
instead of putting it into one.

1459
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,740
Is that,

1460
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,920
that that goes to the gross and
competence I was talking about earlier.

1461
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:29,630
So that's not how they,

1462
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:32,340
there are are the businesses
who also have custodial account

1463
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:37,220
over bitcoin and they implement very
smart systems to segregate bitcoin.

1464
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:38,054
So for example,

1465
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:39,480
on a daily basis,

1466
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:44,481
they will sweep 95 to 98% of
the bitcoin off into a wallets.

1467
00:44:45,661 --> 00:44:48,990
The require three out of
six people to come together.

1468
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,520
To unlock them with the key
separated on separate devices.

1469
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:54,743
Um,

1470
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,000
and those systems are
very difficult to break,

1471
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:57,301
right?

1472
00:44:57,301 --> 00:45:00,720
Because you need collusion
between multiple people
and that protects both from

1473
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:01,560
external theft,

1474
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,770
but it also protects
from internal compromise,

1475
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:06,770
a malicious insider or um,

1476
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:10,050
embezzlement fraud even
by the CEO sometimes.

1477
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:13,260
So there are ways to get around this.

1478
00:45:13,261 --> 00:45:18,000
You can have good security practices
and all of those good security practices

1479
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:22,600
were completely ignored by Mark Karpeles.

1480
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,870
So he's a fuck head no matter what.

1481
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:25,930
Yeah.

1482
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:30,930
So the question really now is gross
incompetence or fraud and we don't know,

1483
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:31,870
but in,

1484
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:33,360
in either case it's bad.

1485
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,680
It hurt a lot of people,

1486
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:36,960
but in the end it had
nothing to do with bitcoin.

1487
00:45:36,961 --> 00:45:40,800
It was a classic bank failure of the
traditional kind that it was the result of

1488
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:44,940
the fact that they fell in a gray area
where they didn't have the protections of

1489
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:47,430
bitcoin and they didn't have the
regulations of a regular bank.

1490
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,410
So this guy lives in Japan.

1491
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:52,320
Did he move to Japan when the shit hit
the fan or was he there the entire time?

1492
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,030
He was there the entire time.

1493
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,440
So he's always lived in Japan.

1494
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:56,340
That's where Mt.

1495
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:56,851
Gox was based.

1496
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:57,050
Yes.

1497
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:57,410
Ah,

1498
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:58,080
interesting.

1499
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:58,470
Okay.

1500
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:58,831
Mt.

1501
00:45:58,831 --> 00:45:59,664
Gox I love it.

1502
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,590
And so Mt.

1503
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,750
Gox now is insolvent.

1504
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:04,501
Is it done?

1505
00:46:04,501 --> 00:46:05,334
I mean there was some

1506
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,400
trying to do some kind of
structured thing and then,

1507
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:08,780
uh,

1508
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,530
I think it was four or five days ago,

1509
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:15,531
the Japanese authorities decided to
decline and forced them into liquidation.

1510
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,650
So they are now done and tick boxes over.

1511
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:24,000
The one thing we can say about Mt
Gox is that they can no longer hurt

1512
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:24,933
anyone else.

1513
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,170
That's the good thing.

1514
00:46:26,171 --> 00:46:26,471
Now,

1515
00:46:26,471 --> 00:46:28,990
this gentleman who runs it or ran it,

1516
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,210
he's walking on the streets.

1517
00:46:31,211 --> 00:46:32,050
He goes places.

1518
00:46:32,051 --> 00:46:33,220
He's just like a regular guy.

1519
00:46:33,221 --> 00:46:34,054
Do they follow him?

1520
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:34,751
I have no idea.

1521
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,350
I think he's on,

1522
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,310
he's under indictment.

1523
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:36,611
I don't,

1524
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:38,080
I don't know what his status is.

1525
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,080
So He's under indictment
from America and from Japan.

1526
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:41,680
Correct.

1527
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:41,980
There's,

1528
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,740
and there's a warrant for
him to come to the states.

1529
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:45,490
Okay.

1530
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:45,940
So,

1531
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,270
um,

1532
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:51,270
it's not as gangster as if he robbed
a bank and held it up with guns.

1533
00:46:51,551 --> 00:46:52,330
Like they're not,

1534
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:55,930
they're not going after him with like
a swat team and dragging them back,

1535
00:46:55,931 --> 00:46:58,030
but most likely he's fucked.

1536
00:46:59,050 --> 00:46:59,620
We'll see.

1537
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,310
Yeah,

1538
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,143
most likely.

1539
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:01,630
Yeah.

1540
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:02,463
I mean I,

1541
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,510
I would be surprised if he doesn't face
some kind of a serious consequences.

1542
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:12,040
You weren't that concerned though about
this in the overall scheme of things for

1543
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:12,611
bitcoin.

1544
00:47:12,611 --> 00:47:15,610
You thought this was just sort of a
bump in the road and that eventually it

1545
00:47:15,611 --> 00:47:20,410
would be overwhelmed by the sheer
positive benefits of cryptocurrencies?

1546
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:21,621
Well,

1547
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:22,670
I mean I think the,

1548
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,120
the thing is that it didn't
really affect bitcoin itself.

1549
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:27,350
It wasn't a weakness of bitcoin.

1550
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,070
It was in fact a very strong arguments

1551
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,620
for why you need to decentralize
financial institutions.

1552
00:47:32,621 --> 00:47:33,670
Cause when you centralize them,

1553
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:35,350
they failed in exactly this fashion.

1554
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:35,780
That's,

1555
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,580
that's what we're trying to
change about financial services.

1556
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:40,720
Make them more decentralized,

1557
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:43,270
diffuse the power so it
can be corrupted and,

1558
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:44,560
and compromised.

1559
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,013
Um,

1560
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,050
there are going to be more,

1561
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:48,700
I'll tell you right now,

1562
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:52,270
there are going to be more bank failures
Bolson bitcoin and of course as they

1563
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:54,340
happen every single year by the hundreds,

1564
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:56,950
they're going to be bank failures
in every currency including bitcoin.

1565
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:01,870
There are going to be CEOs who run away
with the money until we implement better

1566
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:04,540
solutions to control the power.

1567
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:05,650
So for example,

1568
00:48:05,651 --> 00:48:08,560
if you've got a startup and
they raising money in Bitcoin,

1569
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,220
you don't give all of the
keys to one person use,

1570
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:13,840
you split them among multiple people.

1571
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:14,471
So that one part,

1572
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:19,471
because the person you think you know
who's your Cherice partner in this venture

1573
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:22,150
and you've known all your life
and your childhood friends,

1574
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,140
um,

1575
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,110
when they have access to
a couple million dollars,

1576
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:27,580
they change,

1577
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,600
people change their dramatically
and radically affected by money.

1578
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,720
And then all you need is
a precipitating event,

1579
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,190
an illness in the family,

1580
00:48:36,191 --> 00:48:37,150
a crisis,

1581
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,030
you know,

1582
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:38,210
a,

1583
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,150
a bad thing happening to that person.

1584
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:41,770
And they will grab that money and run.

1585
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,120
People make very poor decisions

1586
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,030
and they still tell you the,

1587
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,421
hey man,

1588
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:44,921
I needed it.

1589
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:45,740
Yeah.

1590
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,040
Right?

1591
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,580
And they'll rationalize it or they'll
make a mistake day trading and making a

1592
00:48:49,581 --> 00:48:53,120
loss or losing some of the money
and then trying to cover it up,

1593
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,290
whatever it is that,

1594
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,100
you know,

1595
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,070
my advice to bitcoin companies
is when you're starting out,

1596
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,760
look at the person sitting next to you
and do not assume you can trust them,

1597
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:07,060
assumes that people are fallible and
then put in place controls so that no

1598
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:10,490
single person can run away with money
and then you're going to be much more

1599
00:49:10,491 --> 00:49:12,800
secure and everybody will
be able to be above board.

1600
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,860
David Seaman who was on the podcast last
week had a really interesting take on

1601
00:49:16,861 --> 00:49:18,980
big coin that I thought
it was kinda funny.

1602
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:19,680
Um,

1603
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,210
he was saying that if,

1604
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,530
if bank,

1605
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,850
like Bank of America for [inaudible],

1606
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:24,720
if they were smart,

1607
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:27,000
they would get involved in bitcoin.

1608
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:31,260
It was like you already have
this established name brand,

1609
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:33,150
like cryptocurrencies
are going to be here.

1610
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:33,390
They're,

1611
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:33,750
they're,

1612
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,230
they're,

1613
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:35,063
they're here to stay.

1614
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:35,903
This is his take.

1615
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,243
He was like,

1616
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:41,250
why wouldn't you capitalize on the name
brand that you've already built in on

1617
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,840
and get in on the mark and quick get
it on it now and the early days and

1618
00:49:45,841 --> 00:49:50,841
established like that Bank of America
like still has like a footing in in this

1619
00:49:51,751 --> 00:49:53,730
as well as in regular money.

1620
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,540
And he was like,

1621
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,130
it would be a really wise investment.

1622
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,100
I think you're going
to see that happening.

1623
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,120
Um,

1624
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,340
in short time really,

1625
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:02,581
um,

1626
00:50:02,581 --> 00:50:03,720
we saw this with the Internet,

1627
00:50:03,721 --> 00:50:07,620
which was at first the telecommunications
companies fought tooth and nail.

1628
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:12,390
They could not believe
that a decentralized packet
switch network like the

1629
00:50:12,391 --> 00:50:14,370
Internet would deliver quality,

1630
00:50:14,371 --> 00:50:15,840
voice and quality video.

1631
00:50:15,841 --> 00:50:18,570
They wanted to build highly
controlled and structured networks.

1632
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:19,800
Um,

1633
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,120
and they tried to fight it because it,

1634
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,310
it threatens and long distance market,

1635
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,450
which was very lucrative.

1636
00:50:24,451 --> 00:50:25,680
It threatened many other markets.

1637
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:26,514
Today,

1638
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,810
three quarters of all international
calls happen on Skype.

1639
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:30,830
Three quarters,

1640
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:31,550
three quarters.

1641
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:31,970
That's,

1642
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,700
that's a market that a few,

1643
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:35,021
you know,

1644
00:50:35,021 --> 00:50:36,470
a two decades ago was,

1645
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:36,830
uh,

1646
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,500
15 $20 billion market and disappeared.

1647
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:40,623
Um,

1648
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,770
and essentially they had
to restructure operations.

1649
00:50:42,771 --> 00:50:43,940
Now they made up for it.

1650
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:48,970
The smart ones became very
good as Internet service
providers and created whole

1651
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:50,541
new businesses.

1652
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:52,130
The replace those lost revenues.

1653
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:52,880
So,

1654
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,290
so what happened there is you have these
telecom companies trying to fight it

1655
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,840
until some of the smaller ones,

1656
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,330
some of the ones that don't have solid,

1657
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:05,080
entrenched positions and
can't take advantage of size.

1658
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:05,691
Think,

1659
00:51:05,691 --> 00:51:06,524
you know what,

1660
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,340
maybe I'm going to cut off from this
herd and go play with that bitcoin a bit.

1661
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:11,930
And as soon as that starts happening,

1662
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:15,050
there's almost a stampede because
everybody tries to rush into it.

1663
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,510
That's what happens
with telecommunications.

1664
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:20,840
The smaller providers started peeling
off from the herd and instead of fighting

1665
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:20,931
it,

1666
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:23,120
they started trying to
build service providers.

1667
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:23,480
Uh,

1668
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,090
so it's really just a
matter of who runs first,

1669
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:26,241
right?

1670
00:51:26,241 --> 00:51:28,220
Someone's going to start running and then,

1671
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:33,380
and then the herd breaks apart
because until the first one breaks,

1672
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,220
everyone's like,

1673
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:34,540
well,

1674
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,220
we were too serious
for this bitcoin stuff.

1675
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:40,880
And they're looking over their shoulder
trying to make sure that everybody else

1676
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:42,500
is also staying away from it.

1677
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,140
But eventually the market dynamic changes.

1678
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:46,220
So it's just

1679
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:46,891
essentially,

1680
00:51:46,891 --> 00:51:48,030
it's just human nature,

1681
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,630
like with human nature this to certain
rules that are just always going to be

1682
00:51:51,631 --> 00:51:52,464
into place,

1683
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,540
play hard to get and follow the leader.

1684
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,650
Those are two big ones.

1685
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:56,530
Yeah.

1686
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:01,530
And bitcoin threatens some business
structures within the banking industry.

1687
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:02,510
It May,

1688
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:05,650
it's going to make it difficult for
them to charge exorbitant fees to do

1689
00:52:05,651 --> 00:52:07,720
international wire transfers
when you can do it cheaper.

1690
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:09,730
Just like if you have Skype,

1691
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:14,770
you can't justify $3 a minute
long distance calls and,

1692
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,270
but at the same time the smart bankers
are looking at this and their thing.

1693
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:19,961
Yeah.

1694
00:52:19,961 --> 00:52:22,600
But if we have a cheap,

1695
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,261
efficient,

1696
00:52:23,261 --> 00:52:24,580
secure payment system,

1697
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:28,690
we can build some really interesting
things on top of that and create whole new

1698
00:52:28,691 --> 00:52:32,170
businesses that are very competitive
that can actually give us a lead.

1699
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,030
So we,

1700
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:33,390
oh,

1701
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,260
Alix run the heard the,

1702
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,040
you know,

1703
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,270
disruption in a competitive
market is actually very,

1704
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,143
um,

1705
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,000
very enticing to the,

1706
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,570
to the second and third tier players
because they don't have an advantage.

1707
00:52:46,571 --> 00:52:48,580
They're too small to compete
against the big guys.

1708
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,770
But if they see this
disruptive technology,

1709
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:50,981
I think,

1710
00:52:50,981 --> 00:52:51,220
well,

1711
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,760
maybe if I hit your ride on that
I'm going to overtake everybody.

1712
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:55,840
Um,

1713
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,860
and you know,

1714
00:52:56,861 --> 00:53:00,310
I can be the blockbuster
or I can be the Netflix,

1715
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,860
I can be the tower records,

1716
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:04,780
or I can be the iTunes.

1717
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:08,020
And we've seen this happen
in technology racist before.

1718
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:08,591
Yeah.

1719
00:53:08,591 --> 00:53:10,120
That's fascinating how people,

1720
00:53:10,121 --> 00:53:13,130
some people just don't want
to buck the trends they did.

1721
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:16,540
They don't want to go along with the
flow of things or they want to buck the

1722
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:16,901
trends.

1723
00:53:16,901 --> 00:53:20,160
They want to somehow or
another figure out a way where,

1724
00:53:20,161 --> 00:53:20,590
you know,

1725
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:23,770
they can prove everybody else wrong
and VHS is making a comeback and,

1726
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:24,251
you know,

1727
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:25,830
renting movies still valid.

1728
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:26,340
You know,

1729
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:26,610
there's,

1730
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:30,020
there's a lot of those fuckers out
there that just won't let it go.

1731
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,460
Radio companies change is scary.

1732
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,151
Yeah.

1733
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:33,984
That's scary.

1734
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:34,500
But that's,

1735
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,101
that's a,

1736
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:36,630
that's the nature of the beast.

1737
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,430
Especially today.

1738
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,680
We were involved in the
craziest time for change.

1739
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:41,700
The world's ever known.

1740
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:42,350
Yeah.

1741
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,160
Um,

1742
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,120
there at the moment,

1743
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,860
being on the top of it and industry,

1744
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:50,280
especially an industry that's involved
in technology is a very precarious

1745
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:51,090
position.

1746
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:51,420
You know,

1747
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,770
if you talk to,

1748
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,043
um,

1749
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,210
Kodak a decade ago,

1750
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,620
do you think they would,

1751
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:03,680
they would realize that suddenly it's
the largest vendor or manufacturer of

1752
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:07,620
cameras in the world would
be a telephone company.

1753
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:09,210
Nokia,

1754
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:09,211
Nokia,

1755
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:14,211
within three years became the world's
largest maker of cameras and suddenly the

1756
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:16,260
entire industry changed.

1757
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:16,980
Right.

1758
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,480
And how do you compete against that?

1759
00:54:18,481 --> 00:54:19,800
They're not even in your industry.

1760
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:21,270
They just came out of left field.

1761
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:24,660
It's like you're suddenly the horse
buggy manufacturer and forward is taking

1762
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:28,170
your business and you never
expected that was going to happen.

1763
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:28,531
Well,

1764
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,750
Nokia has a camera phone now,

1765
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,280
a windows phone that is some
insane amount of pixels.

1766
00:54:35,281 --> 00:54:37,830
It's like 40 fucking
megapixels or something,

1767
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:38,933
something crazy.

1768
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,840
41 41 megapixel says Jamie,

1769
00:54:41,841 --> 00:54:42,990
Jamie's on top of that shit.

1770
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,660
41 fucking megapixels on a phone.

1771
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:45,871
I mean,

1772
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:48,210
this thing I think has the note three,

1773
00:54:48,211 --> 00:54:50,010
I think it has 12 or something.

1774
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:51,240
No,

1775
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,290
it's better than that.

1776
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:53,970
Are you familiar with Moore's law?

1777
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,020
Yes.

1778
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,530
So,

1779
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,191
so for,

1780
00:54:56,191 --> 00:54:57,750
for your listeners to Moore's law,

1781
00:54:57,751 --> 00:55:00,420
it was created by Gordon Moore processors,

1782
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:00,660
right?

1783
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,070
Processing speed and yeah,

1784
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:06,600
and what he said was that he estimated
that because of the way silicon works

1785
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:08,070
every 18 months,

1786
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:12,630
the speed of a computer with double
or the price would drop by half.

1787
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,530
And that has been true now
for more than 25 years.

1788
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,430
Wow.

1789
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:17,850
And,

1790
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:21,810
and that thing then plays
out in camera megapixels,

1791
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,780
in storage on SD cards in the size of the,

1792
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,100
of your smartphone,

1793
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:26,881
in the,

1794
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:29,740
a number of sensors you can
put into the smartphone.

1795
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:30,640
And it's battery.

1796
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,060
Battery life is the one
that's lagging behind.

1797
00:55:33,061 --> 00:55:35,640
And it's the main thing that's
holding back this technology.

1798
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:38,310
Moore's law also applies
to things like bitcoin.

1799
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,860
It also applies to
networks like the Internet.

1800
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:44,580
And what it means is that if you're
in an industry that's established and

1801
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:48,210
suddenly you have a competitor that's
coming at you with the power of Moore's

1802
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:49,020
law,

1803
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,830
you better watch out because you're in,

1804
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:54,270
it's not a matter of whether you
will be able to compete in a decade.

1805
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:57,510
It's a matter of whether your
industry will still exist in a decade,

1806
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:58,930
right?

1807
00:55:58,930 --> 00:55:59,580
Yeah.

1808
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,570
Isn't that fascinating?

1809
00:56:00,571 --> 00:56:05,571
That whole industries can just vanish
hundred and 50 years of Kodak and then

1810
00:56:05,701 --> 00:56:07,290
suddenly film doesn't exist,

1811
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,450
God and the decade.

1812
00:56:09,451 --> 00:56:12,780
Do you remember when you used to
have to pay money for long distance?

1813
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,480
Long distance calls don't exist.

1814
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:19,650
You can call New York right now and
your home phone and it's regular call on

1815
00:56:19,651 --> 00:56:20,251
your cell phone.

1816
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,300
It's totally normal.

1817
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,980
Like if you used to call
long distance on a cell

1818
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,251
phone,

1819
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:26,500
it was an exorbitant amount of money.

1820
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,150
Saturday afternoons,

1821
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:28,860
London,

1822
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:29,170
painful.

1823
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:33,520
And when I was a student I would go
there with a stack of coins that was

1824
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:36,520
probably about $10 worth in today's money.

1825
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:41,110
I would sit in a payphone and my family
would know what time I was going to call

1826
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:41,973
coordinated.

1827
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,000
I'd call in,

1828
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,310
they'd be a line of 15 relatives sitting,

1829
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,490
standing behind the phone
on the Athens sides and Avi.

1830
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:49,151
Hi Mom.

1831
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,961
I love you very much.

1832
00:56:49,961 --> 00:56:50,411
Hi Dad.

1833
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:51,230
I love you very much,

1834
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:51,910
Hasis.

1835
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:52,750
It's all awesome.

1836
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,081
Okay,

1837
00:56:53,081 --> 00:56:54,580
next ants,

1838
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,091
ants,

1839
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:55,924
Maria.

1840
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,120
And you know London's awesome.

1841
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:01,480
And I'm stuffing coins as fast
as I can into this pay phone.

1842
00:57:01,481 --> 00:57:02,314
And then you know,

1843
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,690
four or five minutes later,

1844
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:07,690
$10 down the drain and I've said hello
to the entire family and that's all I

1845
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:08,524
could afford.

1846
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,060
That was my experience.

1847
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,380
And now you could Skype for
hours for free and not crazy.

1848
00:57:14,381 --> 00:57:15,630
You could look at a video of you

1849
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:18,910
each other talking to each other
through your laptop for free.

1850
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,261
Wow.

1851
00:57:20,261 --> 00:57:21,071
Fascinating,

1852
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:21,791
fascinating times.

1853
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:23,560
And when you put it in
that kind of a perspective,

1854
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:25,600
you really sort of understand that change.

1855
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:26,943
They just,

1856
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:31,840
the ability that we have to reach out
to each other is just unprecedented in

1857
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:32,501
human history.

1858
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:35,770
It's never been even remotely
close to what it is now.

1859
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,660
I saw somebody walking down
the street the other day,

1860
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:40,300
skyping with someone while they were
walking down the street and they were

1861
00:57:40,301 --> 00:57:41,770
talking while they're
walking down the street.

1862
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:42,011
They're like,

1863
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:42,251
yeah,

1864
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:42,850
so we're gonna,

1865
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:42,971
blah,

1866
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:43,141
blah,

1867
00:57:43,141 --> 00:57:43,690
blah.

1868
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,490
And then the other
person's on the other end.

1869
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:46,450
I'm looking at their phone.

1870
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:46,721
I'm like,

1871
00:57:46,721 --> 00:57:47,411
this is crazy.

1872
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:49,140
They're doing it through
a cell phone connection.

1873
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,460
I'm doing that all the time now.

1874
00:57:50,461 --> 00:57:51,080
Yeah.

1875
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,510
Walking down the street through
a cell phone connection,

1876
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,490
streaming video back
and forth to each other.

1877
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,353
It's amazing.

1878
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,193
Amazing.

1879
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,960
What do you think about things like,

1880
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:05,290
is there a reason why apple doesn't
have any apps where you can exchange

1881
00:58:05,931 --> 00:58:06,560
bitcoin?

1882
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,140
They have some bitcoin monitoring apps,

1883
00:58:09,141 --> 00:58:09,890
correct?

1884
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:10,180
They've,

1885
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:14,850
they've basically banned any apps
that allow you to run a wallet to do

1886
00:58:14,851 --> 00:58:15,430
transactions.

1887
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:17,500
Is there a reason for that?

1888
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:17,771
I mean,

1889
00:58:17,771 --> 00:58:18,610
is there like,

1890
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:23,170
can you find a lug a logical if
you try to take devil's advocate?

1891
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:23,280
Yeah,

1892
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:23,640
there's,

1893
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,510
there's three or four reasons and I can
give you them from the obvious to the,

1894
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,310
to the cynical and paranoid.

1895
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:30,623
Um,

1896
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,033
first of all,

1897
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,880
I think they are worried about this
strange technology that they don't know

1898
00:58:38,221 --> 00:58:41,610
anything about and they're worried about
what kind of reputation hit they'll

1899
00:58:41,611 --> 00:58:43,740
take if one of these apps is compromised,

1900
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,090
um,

1901
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:47,310
and causes their customers to lose money.

1902
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,413
Right.

1903
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,480
I'm more worried then Google who allow
all of these applications on Google play.

1904
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,660
So it's not a legal thing because Google
has lawyers too and they're quite happy

1905
00:58:57,661 --> 00:59:00,270
to allow bitcoin applications
and apple does not like it.

1906
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,190
That's the obvious answer.

1907
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,473
Um,

1908
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,700
there's another thing when whenever you
spend money on buying an APP or buying

1909
00:59:09,031 --> 00:59:10,290
something inside the nap,

1910
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,240
apple takes like 30%

1911
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:13,870
mm.

1912
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:18,190
So their own payment system through the
APP store and iTunes and all of these

1913
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:22,580
things generates an enormous amount of
revenue because they take a very big cut

1914
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:23,503
of these things.

1915
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,710
If you could put a wallet in a phone,

1916
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,250
then you could also
put a wallet in an APP.

1917
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,350
Then you could also do bitcoin
transactions in an APP.

1918
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:35,351
Then why give apple 30% cut if you can
just bypass them and do all the payments

1919
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:37,124
through that?

1920
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,240
That's ultimately going to
be apples demise though.

1921
00:59:40,241 --> 00:59:41,230
I mean if you look at it,

1922
00:59:41,231 --> 00:59:44,050
you want to talk about like people
that had a grip on a market and then it

1923
00:59:44,051 --> 00:59:45,250
slowly slipped away.

1924
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:50,280
Apple had an enormous chunk of the
smartphone market just a few years ago.

1925
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,011
I mean,

1926
00:59:51,011 --> 00:59:56,011
they had the majority of it now 80
something percent of the smart phones or

1927
00:59:56,081 --> 00:59:56,914
android phones.

1928
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,240
That's crazy.

1929
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:58,731
I mean that,

1930
00:59:58,731 --> 00:59:59,950
that's quite amazing.

1931
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:02,590
And the technology has surpassed them.

1932
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:06,610
Now you have several choices with
android phones that are waterproof,

1933
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,710
big giant ones as Sony Experia you could
throw it underwater for a fucking half

1934
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:11,860
an hour,

1935
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:14,080
like five feet of water for half an hour.

1936
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:14,921
I mean the,

1937
01:00:14,921 --> 01:00:16,540
the galaxy s five,

1938
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:17,200
the new one,

1939
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,070
water resistant.

1940
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:20,050
You could take a shower
with it and listen to music.

1941
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:20,640
He,

1942
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,880
you could put a fucking stuff it in your
underwear and literally shower with the

1943
01:00:24,881 --> 01:00:25,361
thing on.

1944
01:00:25,361 --> 01:00:26,194
I mean,

1945
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:27,700
fingerprint sensors,

1946
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,560
they had them first on iPhones,

1947
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,450
but now Samsung galaxies,

1948
01:00:31,451 --> 01:00:33,850
a s five has a fucking heart rate monitor.

1949
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:34,721
I mean,

1950
01:00:34,721 --> 01:00:35,051
there's,

1951
01:00:35,051 --> 01:00:35,770
they're just,

1952
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:36,970
they're ahead of the curve.

1953
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:37,641
Like the,

1954
01:00:37,641 --> 01:00:41,530
the android phones aren't playing
catch up with apple anymore.

1955
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,940
Now they're bypassing him.

1956
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:47,470
And I wonder if that's going to
happen with things like iTunes,

1957
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:48,340
the exchanges,

1958
01:00:48,341 --> 01:00:48,740
things.

1959
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,980
Right now it's convenient to use iTunes.

1960
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,380
But once I switched over to Android,

1961
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,160
um,

1962
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:58,140
I found a thing called double twist
where you could send your music to your

1963
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:58,660
phone,

1964
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,940
you can use iTunes with this thing.

1965
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:04,300
And also I found Amazon Mp3,

1966
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,340
which is just as easy to use,

1967
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:07,510
if not easier.

1968
01:01:07,511 --> 01:01:08,344
Then iTunes.

1969
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,350
I changed as a horrible application.

1970
01:01:10,351 --> 01:01:11,220
I can't stand it.

1971
01:01:11,221 --> 01:01:15,570
It's like you put it on your Mac and you
get a pinwheel every time you click on

1972
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:16,350
anything,

1973
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:18,120
especially if you have a large collection,

1974
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:18,751
it's,

1975
01:01:18,751 --> 01:01:21,900
and it hasn't really changed
or improved much at all.

1976
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:22,650
Um,

1977
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:27,150
but it does ask you to accept the terms
and conditions every time you sneeze.

1978
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,110
Uh,

1979
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:29,580
so you have to click on that thing.

1980
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,270
It's like,

1981
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:31,103
listen,

1982
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:31,830
apple,

1983
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:33,660
I've accepted the terms.

1984
01:01:33,661 --> 01:01:34,494
I haven't read them,

1985
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,400
no one's read them,

1986
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:36,391
but I accept them.

1987
01:01:36,391 --> 01:01:37,410
I accept them forever.

1988
01:01:37,411 --> 01:01:39,600
Just give me a checkbox
that says from now on,

1989
01:01:39,601 --> 01:01:41,010
until the end of time,

1990
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:41,844
I accept,

1991
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:42,930
I accept.

1992
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:43,853
Please.

1993
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:45,471
Yeah.

1994
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:48,470
Do a retina scan every
time I look at your APP,

1995
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,670
as soon I'm accepting.

1996
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:50,450
Um,

1997
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:52,250
I like iTunes for some things.

1998
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:54,080
I use it still to buy movies.

1999
01:01:54,081 --> 01:01:56,150
I use it on my laptop exclusively.

2000
01:01:56,151 --> 01:01:59,030
I use it on my home computer exclusively.

2001
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,320
Like if I'm buying music,

2002
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:02,810
I buy my music and I
buy it off through that.

2003
01:02:02,811 --> 01:02:06,080
But on my phone it's just as
easy to buy it through Amazon.

2004
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:07,280
It's very simple.

2005
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:07,971
It's not,

2006
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:10,250
it's not like some new
thing you have to learn.

2007
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:11,300
Same process.

2008
01:02:11,301 --> 01:02:13,790
You search a genre search an artist,

2009
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,910
oh I wanted to buy like we were in the
green room the other day if the Orlando

2010
01:02:16,911 --> 01:02:17,391
hard rock,

2011
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:22,020
me and Joey Diaz and Joey Diaz goes on
this epic rant about led Zeppelin as led

2012
01:02:22,021 --> 01:02:25,860
Zeppelin one cause there was a poster on
the wall that I took a picture of and I

2013
01:02:25,861 --> 01:02:30,840
put it up on my Instagram and it was the
first tour poster from led Zeppelin in

2014
01:02:30,841 --> 01:02:33,210
1968 69 and we were like,

2015
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:37,110
could you fucking imagine what that
must have been like to experience like

2016
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:38,940
Zeplin for the first time?

2017
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:39,871
Like back then,

2018
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:43,260
like any jelly was going off
about how it blew people away.

2019
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,880
So listening to him,

2020
01:02:44,881 --> 01:02:46,020
I get inspired.

2021
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:49,410
I go to my phone as he's
talking within like 10 seconds,

2022
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:51,780
I type led Zeppelin in the search.

2023
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,620
Boom,

2024
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,610
it's downloading.

2025
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,110
Three seconds after that,

2026
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:55,800
Bam,

2027
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,910
I'm playing the album.

2028
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:57,870
I mean like,

2029
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:58,950
wow,

2030
01:02:58,980 --> 01:02:59,940
that's crazy.

2031
01:02:59,941 --> 01:03:00,840
I put it on speaker,

2032
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:05,250
we sit down and we start laughing about
how easy that is to do and how amazing

2033
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:06,084
this music is.

2034
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:06,971
Well,

2035
01:03:06,971 --> 01:03:07,151
yeah,

2036
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:07,631
exactly.

2037
01:03:07,631 --> 01:03:08,500
I apple,

2038
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:09,520
um,

2039
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,380
change the way we think about music,

2040
01:03:11,381 --> 01:03:13,360
change the way we think about phones,

2041
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:14,200
um,

2042
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,120
and created all of these new technologies.

2043
01:03:16,121 --> 01:03:16,954
But here's the,

2044
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:17,950
this happens again,

2045
01:03:17,951 --> 01:03:19,300
again in technology as part of the,

2046
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:20,680
let me give you the context.

2047
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,151
By the way,

2048
01:03:21,151 --> 01:03:24,960
iTunes stores not loading right
now just to show you pinwheel.

2049
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:27,240
So it's been willing right now.

2050
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:28,680
I clicked it as you,

2051
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:29,670
as you brought that up.

2052
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:29,971
I said,

2053
01:03:29,971 --> 01:03:30,770
let's see.

2054
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:31,351
And I clicked it.

2055
01:03:31,351 --> 01:03:32,400
It's fucking not loading.

2056
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:36,560
So what happens with technology

2057
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:40,420
again and again is that you always
have to make this trade off.

2058
01:03:40,421 --> 01:03:45,070
Do you want to have an experience that's
very tightly controlled and therefore

2059
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:45,910
consistent,

2060
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:46,271
right?

2061
01:03:46,271 --> 01:03:48,640
You combine a very
limited set of hardware,

2062
01:03:48,641 --> 01:03:50,230
very limited set of features.

2063
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,650
But what you get is that it
works every time consistently.

2064
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:58,120
And then you can have this kind of wild
west situation as you do with android.

2065
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:02,530
And at first it creates a
lot of fragmentation and
everything's inconsistent and

2066
01:04:02,531 --> 01:04:03,610
it doesn't work very well.

2067
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:04,990
But over time,

2068
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:05,980
here's what happens.

2069
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:09,910
The controlled situation that gave you
the advantage at first starts lagging

2070
01:04:09,911 --> 01:04:14,770
behind innovation because it can't change
fast enough and the wild west starts

2071
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:19,060
getting better and better at
quality until eventually it wins.

2072
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,000
And we've seen this happen over time.

2073
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,240
And then the,

2074
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:26,050
the control situation has to
open up the borders again.

2075
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:27,610
Let everybody flood in,

2076
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,820
do a lot of fragmentation
and experimentation and
the cycle starts again.

2077
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:32,560
That's going to happen to,

2078
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:33,610
I mean,

2079
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:35,770
we're going to see much
more openness and music.

2080
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:38,140
We're going to see more openness
and phones as a result of this.

2081
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:41,500
And then apple will have to actually
go out and invent something new.

2082
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:42,370
Um,

2083
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:43,300
instead of just,

2084
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:44,110
you know,

2085
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:45,940
small incremental changes,

2086
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:46,591
oh shit,

2087
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,490
it's bothering you,

2088
01:04:47,491 --> 01:04:48,140
man,

2089
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,620
bothering me and bothering me.

2090
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:49,951
What?

2091
01:04:49,951 --> 01:04:51,000
It's 52%,

2092
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:51,211
uh,

2093
01:04:51,211 --> 01:04:53,610
android and 41% uh,

2094
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:54,480
is uh,

2095
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:57,240
apple is that you went to Reno was 80.

2096
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:02,580
That's a red 80 somewhere and a apple
still has sold more a applications.

2097
01:05:03,751 --> 01:05:04,141
It's a,

2098
01:05:04,141 --> 01:05:06,030
apple has sold 50 APP,

2099
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,220
50 million apps I think
or something like that.

2100
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:09,061
An android,

2101
01:05:09,061 --> 01:05:11,100
it's up to 48 million apps.

2102
01:05:11,101 --> 01:05:11,670
Total soul.

2103
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:12,720
What's bothering you about it?

2104
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:14,853
Man?

2105
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,370
81% man on cnet.

2106
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,820
Cnet says android dominates 81%
of the world's smart phone market.

2107
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:19,961
Yeah,

2108
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:23,530
that's the global versus I think what you
quoted as us and it's a very different

2109
01:05:23,531 --> 01:05:23,980
market.

2110
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:24,230
Oh,

2111
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:24,720
okay.

2112
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,080
Well let's look at it globally.

2113
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:26,943
So Asia,

2114
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,770
much bigger android penetration.

2115
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:30,161
Okay.

2116
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:30,750
That's what I read.

2117
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:34,500
I was in Vancouver this weekend and I
had to use my android phone completely.

2118
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:36,720
Only using my android phone note.

2119
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,710
No iPhone at all.

2120
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:38,783
And it,

2121
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:43,850
I do not understand people that say that
the android phone is better in any way.

2122
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,300
The camera was horrible.

2123
01:05:45,301 --> 01:05:48,690
I tried to take so many photos using that
camera and this is the note three that

2124
01:05:48,691 --> 01:05:50,250
has like a really nice camera.

2125
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:51,870
That camera is a piece of shit.

2126
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:52,330
All,

2127
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:57,090
all Samsung does is add a bunch of
crap to their phones to be the first,

2128
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:00,830
but they do it so halfassed that
it just doesn't work like that.

2129
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:04,830
Like you keep on taking this heartbeat
sensor and that the thumbprint thing is

2130
01:06:04,831 --> 01:06:05,960
one of the worst input.

2131
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,940
The thumbprint and the
new s five is horrible.

2132
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,620
People are saying it's
the dumbest thing ever,

2133
01:06:10,621 --> 01:06:12,000
that it never works.

2134
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,230
It's just a piece of shit.

2135
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:14,790
Well that's exactly the compromise.

2136
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,010
You need to have control
and tight quality,

2137
01:06:17,011 --> 01:06:19,380
but it's slow or you have speed,

2138
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:19,920
but it's,

2139
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:20,551
it's a,

2140
01:06:20,551 --> 01:06:20,970
you know,

2141
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,980
at first it's flaky.

2142
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:23,470
Yeah.

2143
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:25,470
And I'd be the first director say,

2144
01:06:25,471 --> 01:06:25,681
Hey,

2145
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:26,331
you're right at,

2146
01:06:26,331 --> 01:06:26,760
you know,

2147
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,290
this iPhone is a piece of shit.

2148
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:33,210
I still buy all the newest phones just
because I'm looking just like everyone

2149
01:06:33,211 --> 01:06:34,110
else to find something better.

2150
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,531
But man,

2151
01:06:34,531 --> 01:06:34,910
I,

2152
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:36,990
you can't break this thing being quality.

2153
01:06:36,991 --> 01:06:38,160
Like it's always working.

2154
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,350
You had the best photos
you can possibly get.

2155
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,120
All the APPS are perfect.

2156
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:44,340
I definitely agree with you on the photos.

2157
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,700
There's a big difference between
the iPhone photos and the,

2158
01:06:47,701 --> 01:06:47,821
uh,

2159
01:06:47,821 --> 01:06:48,690
android photos.

2160
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:50,310
I think the sensor,

2161
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:50,551
the,

2162
01:06:50,551 --> 01:06:51,000
like the,

2163
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,331
the,

2164
01:06:51,331 --> 01:06:54,960
the sensor on the iPhone is a lower
megapixel but much higher quality.

2165
01:06:54,961 --> 01:06:56,010
It's just a better phone.

2166
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:57,031
But I'm like,

2167
01:06:57,031 --> 01:06:58,320
what does it mega pixel on the iPhone.

2168
01:06:58,321 --> 01:06:59,010
It's like eight,

2169
01:06:59,010 --> 01:06:59,400
eight,

2170
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,190
eight.

2171
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:00,450
Oh,

2172
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:04,770
forget lenses and things like that
make a huge different Carl Zeiss Lens.

2173
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:05,191
It's,

2174
01:07:05,191 --> 01:07:10,191
I'm back like it's actually 13
megapixels on the galaxy note three.

2175
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:10,650
Yeah.

2176
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:12,210
But it's not as good.

2177
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:12,691
It's,

2178
01:07:12,691 --> 01:07:14,820
it's fine if the light is good.

2179
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:15,773
Are you talking Jamie?

2180
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:16,021
You know,

2181
01:07:16,021 --> 01:07:17,500
you don't have a microphone
on you motherfucker.

2182
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:18,413
I can't hear you.

2183
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:19,350
What are you doing?

2184
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:20,670
Why don't you make sign language at me?

2185
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:21,913
I can't hear that either.

2186
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:23,123
Um,

2187
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:23,611
the,

2188
01:07:23,611 --> 01:07:24,360
uh,

2189
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,193
there's,

2190
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,380
I mean I think there is a
better camera than the iPhone,

2191
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,670
but it's not the note three.

2192
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:30,923
I think there is,

2193
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,610
I'm sure there is a better camera,

2194
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,473
but I'm just saying,

2195
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:35,050
let's find out what's the best.

2196
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,120
Let's Google best smart phone camera.

2197
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,010
I bet apples in the top two.

2198
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:43,690
There was also reports saying that you
know why it's such a big share is not

2199
01:07:43,691 --> 01:07:44,710
because of quality.

2200
01:07:44,711 --> 01:07:49,180
It's because of price that that android
users are more poor and they get more

2201
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:50,380
technology for the money.

2202
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:53,680
So that's why it's become
so popular because all the
poor markets are buying it.

2203
01:07:53,681 --> 01:07:56,860
So it looks like Android's
just destroying apple in that,

2204
01:07:56,861 --> 01:07:57,551
that regards.

2205
01:07:57,551 --> 01:07:59,260
But it's not meaning that it's a better

2206
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:00,090
products.

2207
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:05,090
Smartphone camera overall iPhone
five s it's the mass market audience,

2208
01:08:05,431 --> 01:08:10,020
especially in in Asia where you can get
an android phone for 50 to $100 instead

2209
01:08:10,021 --> 01:08:15,021
of three to $400 equivalent for iPhone
image stabilization and dual led flash.

2210
01:08:17,311 --> 01:08:20,600
She got one of the best phones for
taking pictures in low light or any

2211
01:08:20,601 --> 01:08:21,261
situation.

2212
01:08:21,261 --> 01:08:25,610
Apple has improved its camera app
for the five s what's the difference?

2213
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,140
Oh it does like photos.

2214
01:08:27,141 --> 01:08:28,040
There's slow Mo.

2215
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:29,610
One of the coolest things,

2216
01:08:29,611 --> 01:08:32,130
I think you could do this on the
android offsites burst mode but,

2217
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,860
but being able to adjust and
I didn't even know I had it.

2218
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:36,600
If you just hold down the camera,

2219
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,370
it just takes a million photos.

2220
01:08:38,371 --> 01:08:40,890
So like if you're like with like say
like you want a picture of Joe Rogan,

2221
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:41,940
you just sit there,

2222
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:46,860
hold down the camera it was and take
like 300 photos and then you can just

2223
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:48,680
choose which one you
didn't blink and stuff.

2224
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:49,040
Like

2225
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,060
I do miss the camera.

2226
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:50,990
That's the one thing I missed.

2227
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:52,260
But I don't miss that little bitch.

2228
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:54,830
He screen screens a Joe June.

2229
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:55,850
That's all you have to wait.

2230
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:56,121
Yeah,

2231
01:08:56,121 --> 01:08:56,930
allegedly.

2232
01:08:56,930 --> 01:09:00,350
But that's a 4.71 the 5.51 is
not going to be for a long time.

2233
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,303
It's September.

2234
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:02,541
So says you,

2235
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,130
what are you a Mac insider?

2236
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:04,690
What the fuck?

2237
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:05,310
Do you know

2238
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,170
why in this humongous iPads coming out?

2239
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:07,771
Yeah,

2240
01:09:07,771 --> 01:09:08,640
that's all good dude.

2241
01:09:08,641 --> 01:09:09,840
But this,

2242
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:11,250
I'll take it every day.

2243
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,300
I'll take that all day.

2244
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:13,261
It's not important.

2245
01:09:13,261 --> 01:09:16,380
The camera's not nearly as important
to me as being able to do my email,

2246
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,460
go online.

2247
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,260
Everything plays like flash.

2248
01:09:19,261 --> 01:09:21,900
Anything that has flash
on it plays no problem.

2249
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:22,560
I,

2250
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,510
that to me is gigantic.

2251
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:29,190
When I look at a youtube video and it's
that Goddamn big to me that's huge.

2252
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,780
And also the stylists.

2253
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,790
I fucking love this thing.

2254
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:33,560
Are you kidding me?

2255
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:33,740
Yeah,

2256
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:34,573
I never use it.

2257
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,670
Every time I use the style was
like I'm just wasting my time.

2258
01:09:36,671 --> 01:09:37,030
Why am I,

2259
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:37,830
why am I doing this?

2260
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:38,420
Well I,

2261
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:40,680
I use it a lot for writing my jokes.

2262
01:09:40,681 --> 01:09:40,900
Right.

2263
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:41,230
That's,

2264
01:09:41,230 --> 01:09:43,270
that's interesting that you
do that too because that's,

2265
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,470
it seems so much.

2266
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:45,251
I don't know.

2267
01:09:45,251 --> 01:09:46,810
Like I'm just so fast on the keyboard.

2268
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:47,251
Yeah.

2269
01:09:47,251 --> 01:09:50,700
I mean it's not the fast thing
for me it's a memorization thing.

2270
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:53,580
When you actually write things
physically with your hand,

2271
01:09:53,581 --> 01:09:54,990
you can remember them better.

2272
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:58,050
And this took I for a long time.

2273
01:09:58,051 --> 01:10:00,090
I was still bringing the notebook as well,

2274
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,530
but I gave up on the notebook.

2275
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:02,760
I do it all on this thing now.

2276
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,300
I thought you meant since this Ipod,

2277
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:04,841
iPad,

2278
01:10:04,841 --> 01:10:05,051
air.

2279
01:10:05,051 --> 01:10:08,680
I've been taking my iPad almost everywhere
and now I don't give a shit about my

2280
01:10:08,681 --> 01:10:08,981
phone.

2281
01:10:08,981 --> 01:10:09,850
This is just for texting.

2282
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:11,380
You meet pad or my eye,

2283
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:12,303
my iPad,

2284
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:12,910
my iPad.

2285
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:13,660
Air pod.

2286
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:14,140
Yeah.

2287
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:17,530
This thing is so light and like you
could just keep it everywhere and like if

2288
01:10:17,531 --> 01:10:18,700
you really want to surf the net,

2289
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,780
you know even the new one,

2290
01:10:19,781 --> 01:10:20,614
the small one.

2291
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:21,981
Yeah,

2292
01:10:21,981 --> 01:10:22,970
that is a good move.

2293
01:10:22,971 --> 01:10:24,830
But you can't put it in your pocket.

2294
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:25,440
Yeah,

2295
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:25,951
I don't just,

2296
01:10:25,951 --> 01:10:26,041
I,

2297
01:10:26,041 --> 01:10:26,311
you know,

2298
01:10:26,311 --> 01:10:27,970
I honestly just don't trust the,

2299
01:10:27,971 --> 01:10:28,331
the,

2300
01:10:28,331 --> 01:10:32,740
the apps in the APP store and the Google
apps and the back doors and the hacking

2301
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,100
hackability of the operating system.

2302
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:35,581
To me,

2303
01:10:35,581 --> 01:10:38,700
I think this is the way the iPhone is
just a brick and then see it like your

2304
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:39,534
important stuff,

2305
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,070
the text messages and your,

2306
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:44,620
your crap like that should have the
highest security and not something that

2307
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:46,350
that's so easily been hacked.

2308
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:46,740
So

2309
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:47,401
right here,

2310
01:10:47,401 --> 01:10:50,010
this comparison between control,

2311
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:51,030
quality,

2312
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:54,210
but slow innovation versus speed choice,

2313
01:10:54,211 --> 01:10:55,050
fragmentation,

2314
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:58,680
but flakiness and weird security
problems and cutting edge,

2315
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:03,510
that choice is playing out
in many areas of technology,

2316
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:04,344
whether it's and,

2317
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,510
and this choice played out
on the Internet for at first,

2318
01:11:06,511 --> 01:11:11,430
which was the idea that the Internet was
a far inferior network to the carefully

2319
01:11:11,431 --> 01:11:12,330
controlled,

2320
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:13,140
if you like it,

2321
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,690
phone companies were doing
the iPhone of networks,

2322
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:16,740
right?

2323
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,800
And the Internet was
like the scrappy mess.

2324
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:21,150
See android of networks.

2325
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:26,151
But over time it continued to innovate
and get better and the other systems got

2326
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:29,760
slower and slower and less innovative.

2327
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,000
And so the closest
items have that problem.

2328
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:33,834
They lag,

2329
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,560
but they offer you much better control
and quality and security at first.

2330
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,150
So here's the thing that's been
happening in finance and in finance,

2331
01:11:42,151 --> 01:11:47,151
it's much worse because the closed control
systems of the banks have existed for

2332
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,100
hundreds of years.

2333
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,040
And this scrappy new bitcoin thing,

2334
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:57,000
which is not as fast in many cases,

2335
01:11:57,001 --> 01:12:00,840
but fast and other cases has more choice
but also puts more responsibility for

2336
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:01,411
security.

2337
01:12:01,411 --> 01:12:02,340
It's more flaky,

2338
01:12:02,341 --> 01:12:03,390
it's more scrappy,

2339
01:12:03,391 --> 01:12:04,950
it's more versatile.

2340
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:08,190
It gives you a hell of a lot more choice
and it allows you to innovate really,

2341
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,024
really fast,

2342
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:10,920
doesn't give you the quality.

2343
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,720
You don't have the,

2344
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:13,351
you know,

2345
01:12:13,351 --> 01:12:16,020
the controls and security supposedly,

2346
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,460
but then at the same time,

2347
01:12:17,461 --> 01:12:21,150
the banking system is failing
to deliver to consumers.

2348
01:12:21,151 --> 01:12:24,570
It's failing to deliver security because
people can get away with massive theft

2349
01:12:24,571 --> 01:12:25,380
on it.

2350
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:30,150
And so now what we're seeing is this exact
same scenario that you described that

2351
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:34,170
we saw with the Internet versus telecom
networks that we saw with iPhone versus

2352
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:36,480
android is now playing out
in finance with bitcoin.

2353
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:37,950
That's fascinating.

2354
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:39,180
They say that the best

2355
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:42,900
a camera for power users is that Nokia,

2356
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:42,960
Nokia,

2357
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,570
they had 'em on Tom's guide.

2358
01:12:45,571 --> 01:12:46,110
Dot.

2359
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:47,490
When I'm reading a,

2360
01:12:47,491 --> 01:12:49,290
they've rated a bunch of different ones.

2361
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:51,060
I don't know why Tom
Really knows his shit,

2362
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,000
but it seems like a highly rated side.

2363
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,670
But the 41 megapixel
camera apparently just,

2364
01:12:56,671 --> 01:12:57,870
it's just unbelievable.

2365
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:58,250
It.

2366
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,510
The photos are so big that a,

2367
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:04,710
even when you zoom in like way in like
you could take a photo and zoom way in,

2368
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:07,020
it's still crop it and it's
still an excellent photo.

2369
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:07,441
Yeah.

2370
01:13:07,441 --> 01:13:10,740
That's about the only reason why you'd
want that meeting megapixels though.

2371
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:11,790
Right?

2372
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,120
Because I'm mega pixels,

2373
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:17,310
people stopped caring about megapixels
a while ago for the most part.

2374
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,010
Even some of the higher end
cameras has kind of stopped.

2375
01:13:20,011 --> 01:13:21,660
Even though they could go bigger they,

2376
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:25,620
I mean it's just not as important as
it when it was like from one mega pixel

2377
01:13:25,621 --> 01:13:26,820
that five megapixels,

2378
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:28,380
unless you're making like billboards,

2379
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,740
unless you're making billboards or you
really are just going to spend time just

2380
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:36,030
cropping out sections of large photos
and even that with a such a small device

2381
01:13:36,031 --> 01:13:36,841
that's in your hand.

2382
01:13:36,841 --> 01:13:40,530
I would imagine that there's a lot of
blur and even if you do crop out little

2383
01:13:40,531 --> 01:13:40,921
pieces,

2384
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:44,790
it's still not going to be like something
like if you had a tripod and a DSLR or

2385
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:45,250
something.

2386
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:45,430
Yeah.

2387
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:49,570
They're saying that the galaxy s five
is a big improvement too from the note

2388
01:13:49,571 --> 01:13:51,190
three as far as cameras go.

2389
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:51,790
Yeah.

2390
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:52,450
Yeah.

2391
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:55,180
You get to a point of saturation
where it becomes good enough.

2392
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:59,020
You'll remember the time when you bought
a computer based on how many gigahertz

2393
01:13:59,021 --> 01:14:00,700
it had and how fast it wasn't.

2394
01:14:00,701 --> 01:14:04,540
You needed to upgrade every year and
then we reached a point probably five or

2395
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:08,110
six years ago when you bought a computer
and then it was still perfectly fast

2396
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:11,050
enough for five years later and
you didn't need to upgrade it.

2397
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,070
Right.

2398
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,460
Or when you use the needs a bigger and
bigger hard drive every single year and

2399
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:16,870
then you race the tower by and I are like,

2400
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:17,111
well,

2401
01:14:17,111 --> 01:14:18,910
I can store everything so I'm done.

2402
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:20,170
I don't need anymore.

2403
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:20,560
Right.

2404
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,730
Same thing with megapixels.

2405
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:26,260
You reach a point where at first it makes
a really big difference and then it's

2406
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:29,350
such a small difference that
it doesn't matter anymore.

2407
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:30,280
You've reached saturation,

2408
01:14:30,281 --> 01:14:33,250
you have to find something
else to emphasize.

2409
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:34,150
Some new innovation.

2410
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:35,343
Yeah.

2411
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:35,621
Yeah.

2412
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:36,420
At a certain point,

2413
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,850
Time's going to be very
difficult for one company,

2414
01:14:38,851 --> 01:14:43,050
like a company like apple to compete
with the overwhelming amount of companies

2415
01:14:43,051 --> 01:14:44,850
that are producing android phones.

2416
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:46,230
That's the open ecosystem.

2417
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:50,280
That's the difference between being able
to innovate and multiple places versus

2418
01:14:50,281 --> 01:14:53,430
trying to control everything and you
can really see that too if you pay

2419
01:14:53,431 --> 01:14:57,420
attention to the original android phones
and what they are today as opposed to

2420
01:14:57,421 --> 01:14:58,530
the original iPhone,

2421
01:14:58,531 --> 01:14:59,820
which was incredibly innovative,

2422
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:04,050
like the original iPhone is pretty
close to what they have today.

2423
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,390
I mean it was very similar in size.

2424
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,830
Very similar in look.

2425
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:10,200
Obviously the resolution got better,

2426
01:15:10,201 --> 01:15:11,310
the camera got better,

2427
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,240
it got quicker,

2428
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:12,931
it moves better,

2429
01:15:12,931 --> 01:15:13,710
has more,

2430
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:14,543
more features,

2431
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:19,080
but the original android
phones were dog shit.

2432
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:19,590
Yes,

2433
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:20,910
they were so bad.

2434
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:21,691
Do you remember Brad?

2435
01:15:21,691 --> 01:15:22,201
Did you have one?

2436
01:15:22,201 --> 01:15:23,760
Brian at the front went the first droid.

2437
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:24,270
Yeah.

2438
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:24,660
God,

2439
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,470
I have one too.

2440
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:26,340
It was so bad.

2441
01:15:26,341 --> 01:15:28,640
I had it for one day and
I brought it back in.

2442
01:15:28,641 --> 01:15:31,050
The Verizon guys were trying
to talk me out of it and I go,

2443
01:15:31,051 --> 01:15:31,710
nope,

2444
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:32,310
nope,

2445
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:32,760
nope,

2446
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:33,000
nope,

2447
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,390
nope.

2448
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,020
I'm going to look.

2449
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,160
Take it and they're like,

2450
01:15:35,161 --> 01:15:36,180
well you don't want to bring it back.

2451
01:15:36,181 --> 01:15:37,950
Like just get did get used to it.

2452
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:38,761
I'm telling you,

2453
01:15:38,761 --> 01:15:39,391
I really like it.

2454
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:41,790
Get this piece of shit away from me.

2455
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,210
Cause I had an iPhone and I would try
to switch to a droid to go on Verizon at

2456
01:15:45,211 --> 01:15:46,020
the time.

2457
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:46,800
Woo.

2458
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,670
Is that what you had Brian?

2459
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:47,961
Yeah.

2460
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:50,720
Here's me doing a review of the first one.

2461
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:52,690
Uh,

2462
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:54,890
the phone has a five megapixel camera.

2463
01:15:54,891 --> 01:15:55,880
It's got a flash.

2464
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:58,040
The camera is really good.

2465
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:00,890
It has a watch guy looks
though unfortunately.

2466
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:02,930
And you have to

2467
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:05,690
install,

2468
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,400
look at all this seems kind of,

2469
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:08,720
you know,

2470
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,340
there's some things about
it where you're just like,

2471
01:16:10,341 --> 01:16:11,030
why don't,

2472
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:13,040
why don't they just copy what works?

2473
01:16:13,041 --> 01:16:14,660
You know the iPhone works.

2474
01:16:14,661 --> 01:16:16,640
That's the best way to lead applications,

2475
01:16:16,641 --> 01:16:17,474
whatever.

2476
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:17,871
Uh,

2477
01:16:17,871 --> 01:16:19,470
so there's a couple of things
here and there that I know.

2478
01:16:19,471 --> 01:16:20,271
What's crazy is that,

2479
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:20,900
you know,

2480
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,830
down the line and more that droid
started becoming more unpopular.

2481
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:27,080
They did start copying everything that
iPhone used and that's why they're in

2482
01:16:27,081 --> 01:16:27,651
court right now.

2483
01:16:27,651 --> 01:16:30,140
Samsung versus apple in court.

2484
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:30,360
Yeah.

2485
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:30,700
What are the,

2486
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,360
what is the lawsuit about,

2487
01:16:32,361 --> 01:16:33,230
do you know the specifics?

2488
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:33,441
Oh,

2489
01:16:33,441 --> 01:16:34,610
just a lot of different things.

2490
01:16:34,611 --> 01:16:34,820
Like,

2491
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:35,540
like uh,

2492
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:36,170
like uh,

2493
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:36,441
the,

2494
01:16:36,441 --> 01:16:40,610
the unlock screen I think like how you
unlock the phone and just different like

2495
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:41,211
you know,

2496
01:16:41,211 --> 01:16:42,920
operating systems shit that,

2497
01:16:42,921 --> 01:16:43,730
that pretty much,

2498
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:45,350
they just kind of just copied

2499
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:46,770
that apple figured out first.

2500
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:49,440
And so the new iPhone is
supposed to come out in June,

2501
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:49,970
is that right?

2502
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:53,600
You is supposedly like the new iPhone
six and then they're going to have the

2503
01:16:53,601 --> 01:16:54,301
giant one.

2504
01:16:54,301 --> 01:16:57,200
Supposedly this is just what they do
every year where they announced it in June

2505
01:16:57,201 --> 01:16:58,850
and then it's like the
next month they'll have,

2506
01:16:59,080 --> 01:16:59,440
you know,

2507
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,220
one come out and then the bigger one,

2508
01:17:01,221 --> 01:17:03,950
like I guess in the other reason why
they're waiting a little bit longer,

2509
01:17:03,951 --> 01:17:04,520
it's because the,

2510
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:08,240
the panels that are going to be using
and the new phone or backwards so much

2511
01:17:08,241 --> 01:17:10,430
because when starts selling something new,

2512
01:17:10,431 --> 01:17:10,611
it's,

2513
01:17:10,611 --> 01:17:11,340
you know,

2514
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:11,640
it,

2515
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,180
it pretty much just destroys
anyone that does that.

2516
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:14,541
You know,

2517
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:15,860
like we make five inch screens.

2518
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:16,251
Well yeah,

2519
01:17:16,251 --> 01:17:18,110
apple is going to buy 5 million of these.

2520
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:19,200
So it right.

2521
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,050
Their screens are different
too than like the,

2522
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:26,340
that was the other thing
that I was reading about the
difference between the ht

2523
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:27,270
one m eight,

2524
01:17:27,271 --> 01:17:31,020
which is like probably the
highest rated android phone.

2525
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:31,500
Right.

2526
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:31,830
Um,

2527
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:32,640
have you seen that one?

2528
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:32,880
Yeah,

2529
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,200
it's pretty fucking slick.

2530
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:36,570
I even read an actual uh,

2531
01:17:36,571 --> 01:17:38,640
apple website was um,

2532
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:39,361
uh,

2533
01:17:39,361 --> 01:17:44,361
reviewing the HTC one m eight and they
were saying that if apple built uh,

2534
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,630
an android phone,

2535
01:17:45,631 --> 01:17:46,980
this would be the phone that they built.

2536
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:51,150
It's pretty fucking slick and they
actually have a different approach to

2537
01:17:51,151 --> 01:17:52,260
camera's entirely.

2538
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:54,270
They have a small mega pixel phone.

2539
01:17:54,271 --> 01:17:58,980
That's how slick looking phone apparently
the sound on these is incredible.

2540
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,900
The sound is supposed to be amazing.

2541
01:18:00,901 --> 01:18:04,680
Like literally it sounds like are a little
radio like all like a little boombox.

2542
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:06,690
I think that's one of
the big deals to that.

2543
01:18:06,691 --> 01:18:11,580
Why I haven't been happy with as much
as they android is I really think that

2544
01:18:11,581 --> 01:18:14,970
Samsung is not actually the
best maker of the phones.

2545
01:18:14,971 --> 01:18:17,880
I think like even like
these HTC seem a little bit

2546
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,640
better put together.

2547
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:21,211
Yeah.

2548
01:18:21,211 --> 01:18:21,391
Well,

2549
01:18:21,391 --> 01:18:25,380
this one is like particularly well
designed but this one only has a four

2550
01:18:25,381 --> 01:18:28,890
megapixel or if they
call ultra pixel phone.

2551
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:29,850
Yeah,

2552
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:31,440
or ultra picture camera rather.

2553
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:35,670
And I don't understand that
but it has to camera lenses.

2554
01:18:35,671 --> 01:18:39,390
You see what they're doing there while
you're clicking back and forth with the

2555
01:18:39,391 --> 01:18:44,391
two lenses are there's two different
cameras on the back and those two cameras

2556
01:18:44,491 --> 01:18:49,491
allow you to blur out the foreground
or the background if you so choose to.

2557
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:51,210
It's pretty slick for photos.

2558
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,510
I've seen the uh,

2559
01:18:52,511 --> 01:18:56,010
the pictures but four megapixels is just,

2560
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,960
the images are just not
going to be as large.

2561
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:59,310
The real question becomes,

2562
01:18:59,311 --> 01:19:00,960
is four megapixels enough,

2563
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,000
four phones,

2564
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:05,180
phones are actually taking over cameras.

2565
01:19:05,181 --> 01:19:05,421
I,

2566
01:19:05,421 --> 01:19:05,810
I'm,

2567
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:09,470
I haven't looked lately but I'm pretty
sure that that the camera sales,

2568
01:19:09,471 --> 01:19:14,471
especially pointed shooters are completely
other than it should or I used to buy

2569
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:16,220
them all the time because you know,

2570
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,680
those were great to put in
your pocket but now it is,

2571
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:19,250
you don't need it.

2572
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:19,461
Yeah.

2573
01:19:19,461 --> 01:19:23,240
I have one that I use
just for after shows.

2574
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:27,290
Like why I have people like line up and
take pictures with them and then I put

2575
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:30,290
it up on my website cause
it cause it saves time.

2576
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:31,483
But um,

2577
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:32,773
the uh,

2578
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:34,880
the actual need for them,

2579
01:19:34,881 --> 01:19:39,440
for the average person it's
almost nonexistent unless
you're like one of those

2580
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:43,520
SLR type people that has a big
crazy lens and all that jazz.

2581
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,540
I guess that that technology you
were talking about like blurring the

2582
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:50,490
foregrounds actually built into the
new android operating system that,

2583
01:19:50,491 --> 01:19:50,930
that,

2584
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:51,900
that whole thing.

2585
01:19:51,901 --> 01:19:52,050
Yeah.

2586
01:19:52,050 --> 01:19:52,531
Yeah.

2587
01:19:52,531 --> 01:19:54,060
You can do it with software.

2588
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:58,530
The difference with the HTC one is it
actually does it with hardware as well and

2589
01:19:58,531 --> 01:19:59,820
it's supposed to look slicker.

2590
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:04,620
They have that avail of that ability
to do it on the HTC or not the HDC,

2591
01:20:04,621 --> 01:20:06,900
the Samsung galaxy s five as well.

2592
01:20:06,901 --> 01:20:08,100
You do that in

2593
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:08,933
the background.

2594
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,890
I just think that what HTC has decided
to do is try to do it with two different

2595
01:20:13,891 --> 01:20:15,450
cameras at the same time.

2596
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:16,690
So is this the,

2597
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:17,960
what would you say this is the,

2598
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:18,590
the,

2599
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:20,330
the one to do the buy now.

2600
01:20:20,331 --> 01:20:21,470
If you were going to get a new android or,

2601
01:20:21,471 --> 01:20:21,680
Gee,

2602
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,820
you think the nexus right?

2603
01:20:22,821 --> 01:20:23,370
The next,

2604
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:24,540
I love the nexus eyeful.

2605
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:24,680
Yeah,

2606
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:28,670
I like the HTC one two I have to
say I think both of them are great,

2607
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:30,140
great hardware solutions.

2608
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:34,880
Then you have to really be careful about
what software is loaded on them because

2609
01:20:34,881 --> 01:20:36,380
depending on which car you get it from,

2610
01:20:36,381 --> 01:20:37,970
they're going to have
different quality of software.

2611
01:20:37,971 --> 01:20:41,720
Where this is the latest kit
Kat or an earlier version I get,

2612
01:20:41,721 --> 01:20:42,650
my phone's on locked,

2613
01:20:42,651 --> 01:20:45,970
I wiped them and I replaced the software
with my own choices immediately.

2614
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:46,883
Right.

2615
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:47,410
It does.

2616
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:48,071
How hard is that?

2617
01:20:48,071 --> 01:20:49,240
How much time does that take?

2618
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:50,863
It's not a matter of,

2619
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:53,890
I mean it takes me two or three
days to get everything done,

2620
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,420
but I mean,

2621
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:56,050
you know,

2622
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:56,281
not,

2623
01:20:56,281 --> 01:20:57,640
not full time time.

2624
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,990
That's a lot of time.

2625
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:00,480
Nobody does this stuff.

2626
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:00,791
Listen,

2627
01:21:00,791 --> 01:21:01,071
I'm a,

2628
01:21:01,071 --> 01:21:02,710
I'm a technology contrary and I,

2629
01:21:02,711 --> 01:21:04,330
android versus iPhone.

2630
01:21:04,331 --> 01:21:06,700
I do android windows versus Linux.

2631
01:21:06,701 --> 01:21:09,460
I do Linux even when
it's at first dog shits,

2632
01:21:09,461 --> 01:21:10,510
user experience.

2633
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:13,680
I do it anyway for the
freedom and the versatility.

2634
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:18,990
Mac Laptop and I'm an early
adopter on a bitcoin and so yeah,

2635
01:21:19,481 --> 01:21:23,440
I have a Mac laptop and I run the run
apple on or I read something crazy.

2636
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,420
I run apple on it tonight.

2637
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:27,310
Also run Linux machines on
it too as virtual machines.

2638
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:28,270
Um,

2639
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:30,250
so I have a combination
of operating systems here.

2640
01:21:30,251 --> 01:21:32,020
But you run Linux on an apple laptop,

2641
01:21:32,021 --> 01:21:32,854
you could do that.

2642
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:33,250
Yeah,

2643
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:33,930
it was not official.

2644
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:34,840
I know that you could do that.

2645
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:37,680
They still have that option
to run windows on Mac laptops.

2646
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:38,740
We've got windows seven here,

2647
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:40,360
two windows

2648
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:40,911
man.

2649
01:21:40,911 --> 01:21:42,470
Have you used lately?

2650
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,940
It's so do they,

2651
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:46,600
when are they just going
to give up and start over?

2652
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:47,483
Not going to they uh,

2653
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:49,370
they still have a giant
chunk of the market.

2654
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:49,670
Yeah,

2655
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:53,570
I love what they're doing now is that
they're actually making money off a still

2656
01:21:53,571 --> 01:21:56,120
supporting windows 98 to banks.

2657
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:56,961
Like they were like,

2658
01:21:56,961 --> 01:21:57,141
no,

2659
01:21:57,141 --> 01:22:01,220
we give up on windows 98 or XP
and we give up on windows XP,

2660
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,320
but will you know if you want to pay us.

2661
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:07,800
Did you remember when they had windows
stores at the mall that didn't sell

2662
01:22:07,801 --> 01:22:08,580
anything?

2663
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,413
Yeah,

2664
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:11,090
they had a windows store and I went in.

2665
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:11,401
I'm like,

2666
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:12,270
do you guys sell computers?

2667
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:12,481
They go,

2668
01:22:12,481 --> 01:22:12,721
no.

2669
01:22:12,721 --> 01:22:13,260
I go,

2670
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:14,850
what the fuck are you doing?

2671
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,640
You guys are windows and
you don't sell computers.

2672
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:19,220
While we're windows were
not computer sellers.

2673
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:19,411
We're,

2674
01:22:19,411 --> 01:22:20,340
we're an operating system.

2675
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:21,330
They sold windows.

2676
01:22:21,331 --> 01:22:22,260
You could buy windows there.

2677
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:24,373
Yeah.

2678
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:25,860
The coups talk.

2679
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:26,730
Who's running this?

2680
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:27,630
Let me talk to that guy.

2681
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:28,251
He,

2682
01:22:28,251 --> 01:22:29,084
dude,

2683
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:30,870
this is fucking stupid.

2684
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:32,190
You have all this cool shit.

2685
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:35,580
Like you should like have a variety of
different manufacturers have really cool

2686
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:36,414
computers.

2687
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,273
Yeah.

2688
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,430
Maybe I'm wrong.

2689
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:41,490
They haven't been out of the windows
store is now sell everything.

2690
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:42,571
Laptops.

2691
01:22:42,571 --> 01:22:43,650
They have all that stuff.

2692
01:22:43,651 --> 01:22:46,670
The surface and it's still not of itself.

2693
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,191
Yeah.

2694
01:22:47,191 --> 01:22:47,461
You know,

2695
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:48,630
I'm more interested in these,

2696
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:50,130
these into android notebooks.

2697
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:51,060
I saw one the other day.

2698
01:22:51,061 --> 01:22:52,230
I think that's the way to go.

2699
01:22:52,231 --> 01:22:54,480
If you just want it a little
teeny notebook to put in your,

2700
01:22:54,481 --> 01:22:54,811
you know,

2701
01:22:54,811 --> 01:22:56,760
the check email and stuff like that.

2702
01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:59,170
Maybe they did sell
computers and I'm wrong.

2703
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:00,280
Okay.

2704
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:03,130
I think there were some early windows
stores that didn't and it was just more

2705
01:23:03,131 --> 01:23:04,400
like kiosks or no,

2706
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:05,170
not,

2707
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:05,800
yeah,

2708
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,330
when I went to one of
them that's what are,

2709
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:08,613
maybe I'm wrong,

2710
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,780
I'm trying to remember cause
it was quite a while ago,

2711
01:23:10,781 --> 01:23:13,540
but I remember going in and my kids
were playing with like one of the things

2712
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:14,280
that they,

2713
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:19,140
like I said says this article on cio.com
for things you'll love about HTCs once

2714
01:23:19,141 --> 01:23:20,070
and for you won't.

2715
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:25,460
What you won't love about the HTC one
inmate duo camera is disappointing single

2716
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:27,181
most unfortunately.

2717
01:23:27,181 --> 01:23:28,830
Thing about HD one is to camera.

2718
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:29,580
Okay.

2719
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:34,440
The device rear facing four megapixel
duo camera with ultra pixel technology

2720
01:23:34,441 --> 01:23:39,441
stop moving two different lenses allows
user to d checked and calculate the

2721
01:23:40,231 --> 01:23:42,000
relative distance of
subjects in the image.

2722
01:23:42,001 --> 01:23:42,571
Sounds cool.

2723
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:42,990
Right?

2724
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:46,590
Well except for the
measly four megapixels,

2725
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:52,010
it doesn't take long to at all to realize
that while the camera works fairly

2726
01:23:52,351 --> 01:23:53,930
well in dimly lit environments.

2727
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:54,031
Oh.

2728
01:23:54,031 --> 01:23:54,930
So that was the idea.

2729
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
They kept with the low mega pixel
to or another function better in low

2730
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:01,890
environments,

2731
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:06,640
but then that that quality turned
the Tay is to be left to be desired.

2732
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:07,000
So the,

2733
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,171
the,

2734
01:24:07,171 --> 01:24:08,680
the what you're going to
use it most of the time,

2735
01:24:08,681 --> 01:24:09,520
probably during the day.

2736
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:10,833
It sucks.

2737
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:11,351
Okay.

2738
01:24:11,351 --> 01:24:15,640
So there's only two options that are
really good if you want to go with,

2739
01:24:15,641 --> 01:24:16,474
uh,

2740
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,080
with,

2741
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:18,040
with phones,

2742
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:18,581
it's a,

2743
01:24:18,581 --> 01:24:20,740
that Lumina and the,

2744
01:24:20,741 --> 01:24:21,220
uh,

2745
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:22,053
the apple,

2746
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:23,380
those are the two big ones.

2747
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:23,771
Oh.

2748
01:24:23,771 --> 01:24:26,920
And then apparently there's
Sony Xperia too for cameras.

2749
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:27,520
Yeah.

2750
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,430
The Sony Xperia apparently
has a pretty dope camera too.

2751
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:33,460
So I think the reason they're putting
two cameras on the back of the phone,

2752
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:37,480
which would be interesting is where
you get to the ability to shoot 3-d

2753
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:38,463
directly.

2754
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:39,790
Because if you think about it,

2755
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:44,350
this phone is now wide enough that you
can separate the cameras if five about as

2756
01:24:44,351 --> 01:24:48,670
much as your eyes are separated at the
focal distance and then you can shoot,

2757
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:49,720
um,

2758
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,830
direct three d off two cameras.

2759
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:51,971
Well,

2760
01:24:51,971 --> 01:24:53,170
do you remember when they had that?

2761
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:56,860
For awhile they had three d photography
on some of those crazy phones.

2762
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:57,713
You remember?

2763
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:58,720
Was it good enough?

2764
01:24:58,721 --> 01:25:01,840
There were really weird and
it only worked on your phone.

2765
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:03,400
It wouldn't work on the computer.

2766
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,833
Look at there

2767
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:05,751
the first,

2768
01:25:05,751 --> 01:25:09,410
the first iteration is
always clooci and heal,

2769
01:25:09,411 --> 01:25:11,140
but I like to have the choice.

2770
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:11,600
Yeah.

2771
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,650
Cloogy let's close.

2772
01:25:12,651 --> 01:25:13,690
You mean it's,

2773
01:25:13,730 --> 01:25:14,630
it's rough.

2774
01:25:14,631 --> 01:25:16,100
It's rough around the edges.

2775
01:25:16,101 --> 01:25:21,030
Would have ever used an English
word to start using g chord.

2776
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:21,873
He'd be herbal.

2777
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:24,560
How dare you double it?

2778
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:25,880
Urban Dictionary.

2779
01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:26,420
Is it?

2780
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:26,661
Oh,

2781
01:25:26,661 --> 01:25:27,410
it's an urban one.

2782
01:25:27,410 --> 01:25:27,770
Oh,

2783
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:28,130
I dunno.

2784
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:28,641
It's a geek.

2785
01:25:28,641 --> 01:25:29,330
It's a geek term,

2786
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:32,870
but I mean it's the first iteration
of the technology has always flaky,

2787
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,670
but if it's a powerful
and disruptive enough,

2788
01:25:37,671 --> 01:25:40,880
then there'll be an
incentive to make it better.

2789
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:44,780
When when I use the first
iterations of web browsers,

2790
01:25:44,781 --> 01:25:45,680
there were terrible.

2791
01:25:45,681 --> 01:25:47,690
The first versions of
android there were terrible,

2792
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,553
and guess what?

2793
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:51,560
The first versions of
bitcoin wallets are terrible,

2794
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:54,740
but I have choice and I love that.

2795
01:25:54,741 --> 01:25:55,130
I'd love,

2796
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:58,520
I'd rather be on the cutting edge and
be dealing with something that's rough

2797
01:25:58,521 --> 01:26:02,180
around the edges and get to experience
the technology as it matures.

2798
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:06,410
Eventually it will get to the point
where it's as easy to use as an IPAD,

2799
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:09,550
which is how my mom got on
the Internet and Bitcoin,

2800
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:10,860
we'll get to that point to,

2801
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:12,173
uh,

2802
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:13,310
to me choices,

2803
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:14,480
more importance than,

2804
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:15,380
than Polish.

2805
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:18,770
But for other people they go with the
opposite choice and that's perfectly

2806
01:26:18,771 --> 01:26:19,604
understandable.

2807
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,520
That's interesting man.

2808
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:22,750
Yeah,

2809
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,310
I agree with you in a lot of ways,

2810
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:29,610
but I think that there's a
similarity to a windows and apple,

2811
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:31,631
you know,

2812
01:26:31,631 --> 01:26:32,180
the,

2813
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:34,780
as far as like apple phones and you know,

2814
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:36,010
the,

2815
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:39,700
the whole idea of the way apple lock
things down and controls it and windows

2816
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:42,850
where they don't and they allow
you to get into the registry,

2817
01:26:42,851 --> 01:26:45,850
the allow you to do a lot of things with
the computers and a lot of power users

2818
01:26:45,851 --> 01:26:47,220
like break it.

2819
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:47,741
Yeah.

2820
01:26:47,741 --> 01:26:48,820
The average person might,

2821
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,160
it might fuck it up and up.

2822
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:55,830
So do you think that that could
possibly have like a rational,

2823
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:57,100
uh,

2824
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:01,630
effect on Apple's decision to not have
bitcoin wallets outside of the commerce?

2825
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:01,891
Oh,

2826
01:27:01,891 --> 01:27:02,431
absolutely.

2827
01:27:02,431 --> 01:27:02,641
Yeah.

2828
01:27:02,641 --> 01:27:03,510
So as I said,

2829
01:27:03,511 --> 01:27:03,751
you know,

2830
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:04,140
the,

2831
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:08,340
the straightforward one is that it
introduces risk and an environment that is

2832
01:27:08,341 --> 01:27:11,040
deliberately conservative about quality,

2833
01:27:11,041 --> 01:27:13,080
security and control over the environment.

2834
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,620
So they're going to be slow to
adopt things that are disruptive

2835
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:22,560
and it's also self serving because it
threatens their payment network and it

2836
01:27:22,561 --> 01:27:26,550
might be self serving because it also
threatens their ability to introduce their

2837
01:27:26,551 --> 01:27:29,460
own form of digital currency
with digital wallets,

2838
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:32,070
which there are a lot of
rumors that they're in,

2839
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,110
in working on that.

2840
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:35,290
Um,

2841
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:35,480
I,

2842
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:36,260
I don't,

2843
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:36,420
yeah,

2844
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:39,510
I mean you can take all of those
together and it makes sense,

2845
01:27:39,511 --> 01:27:43,410
but it's not a longterm decision because
if there's enough momentum behind

2846
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:44,370
digital currencies,

2847
01:27:44,371 --> 01:27:47,400
eventually they're going to add
them slower than everybody else,

2848
01:27:47,401 --> 01:27:48,234
but they will get it.

2849
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:52,630
Have you thought about the future
and looked at like the trends,

2850
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:54,220
the technological trends,

2851
01:27:54,221 --> 01:27:55,360
and tried to extrapolate,

2852
01:27:55,361 --> 01:28:00,361
like what would be the method for
exchanging controlling bitcoin in the very

2853
01:28:00,971 --> 01:28:01,601
near future?

2854
01:28:01,601 --> 01:28:06,601
Is there like a better version of what
these apps can provide on phones that you

2855
01:28:07,421 --> 01:28:09,880
believe could be implemented
sometime in the near future?

2856
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:10,251
Oh,

2857
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:11,084
absolutely.

2858
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:11,660
I mean,

2859
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:12,530
at the moment,

2860
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:13,933
um,

2861
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:14,890
you,

2862
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:19,890
you don't want to have a lot of the raw
elements of the system expose to users

2863
01:28:21,021 --> 01:28:22,990
who don't want to learn
anything about these.

2864
01:28:22,991 --> 01:28:26,210
So right now there's a pretty steep
learning curve if you want to understand

2865
01:28:26,211 --> 01:28:27,490
digital crypto currencies,

2866
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:28,220
uh,

2867
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,240
just the name alone,

2868
01:28:29,241 --> 01:28:32,420
like crypto currencies sounds
so awfully geeky and weird,

2869
01:28:32,421 --> 01:28:35,090
but if you want to
understand digital money,

2870
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:36,290
let's start by renaming that,

2871
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:36,530
right?

2872
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:37,670
So it's a digital money.

2873
01:28:37,671 --> 01:28:39,080
If you want to understand digital money,

2874
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,903
um,

2875
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:42,710
you get introduced these terms,

2876
01:28:42,711 --> 01:28:43,311
public key,

2877
01:28:43,311 --> 01:28:45,500
private key encryption,

2878
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:47,720
address wallet,

2879
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,400
a Bitcoin address,

2880
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:50,240
uh,

2881
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,080
transaction.

2882
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:54,980
All of these are confusing terms because
they don't actually mean what they,

2883
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:55,730
what they,

2884
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:56,570
what you think they mean.

2885
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:01,840
So a bitcoin wallet is not actually a
wallet because it doesn't contain coins.

2886
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:04,920
It only contains the keys that
allow you to unlock the coins.

2887
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:08,430
The coins are actually on the network and
you get into all of these things where

2888
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:12,600
you've picked a name that
name evokes a thought,

2889
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:16,200
but that thought doesn't quite
match what's really happening.

2890
01:29:16,201 --> 01:29:19,290
So it ends up confusing
rather than enlightened.

2891
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:19,591
Right?

2892
01:29:19,591 --> 01:29:24,591
So a good name is one that tells you how
this is going to work because it evokes

2893
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:26,880
the correct paradigm,

2894
01:29:26,881 --> 01:29:28,230
the correct user interface

2895
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:30,930
design.

2896
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,930
And so we don't have that in bit coin yet.

2897
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:35,700
The words are wrong,

2898
01:29:35,701 --> 01:29:37,020
the terminology is wrong.

2899
01:29:37,021 --> 01:29:39,630
The user interface and user
experience is still very,

2900
01:29:39,631 --> 01:29:40,464
very geeky.

2901
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,390
And you know,

2902
01:29:42,391 --> 01:29:43,620
that happened on the Internet.

2903
01:29:43,621 --> 01:29:48,621
I remember watching in 1994 there's this
classic segment on Good Morning America

2904
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:51,300
when the like,

2905
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:51,870
so,

2906
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:54,150
so the thing with the at
sign is that the Internet,

2907
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:54,841
no,

2908
01:29:54,841 --> 01:29:55,021
no,

2909
01:29:55,021 --> 01:29:55,351
Kelly.

2910
01:29:55,351 --> 01:29:55,741
That's,

2911
01:29:55,741 --> 01:29:57,990
that's email and um,

2912
01:29:58,170 --> 01:29:59,040
and the dots,

2913
01:29:59,041 --> 01:29:59,341
that's,

2914
01:29:59,341 --> 01:30:00,390
that's the internet.

2915
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:04,260
And so why are there all the
slashes and what does an IP address?

2916
01:30:04,261 --> 01:30:05,640
And I don't really understand any of this.

2917
01:30:05,641 --> 01:30:06,140
Right.

2918
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:06,720
It,

2919
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,400
and you get to two things.

2920
01:30:08,401 --> 01:30:08,910
One,

2921
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:11,340
the technology gets
smoother and more polished,

2922
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:14,490
and the words get at the same time,

2923
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:19,520
the culture changes and the
culture gradually adopts
the terminology so that now

2924
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:25,740
people are more comfortable with a weird
words and the words have gotten less

2925
01:30:25,741 --> 01:30:29,070
weird and somewhere in the middle of the
meat and you get mainstream adoption.

2926
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,651
Uh,

2927
01:30:29,651 --> 01:30:34,651
are people working on trying to get any
sort of a bit coin wallet reintroduced

2928
01:30:34,981 --> 01:30:35,880
into the Apple,

2929
01:30:36,490 --> 01:30:38,730
the APP store because
there was one for a while,

2930
01:30:38,731 --> 01:30:38,911
right?

2931
01:30:38,911 --> 01:30:40,170
Was there more than one or was one,

2932
01:30:40,171 --> 01:30:41,190
it was more than one.

2933
01:30:41,191 --> 01:30:42,390
And now there's more to,

2934
01:30:42,391 --> 01:30:46,050
there's new ones have been reintroduced
already to the apple store.

2935
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:46,321
Yes,

2936
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:46,891
absolutely.

2937
01:30:46,891 --> 01:30:48,150
They use a few little,

2938
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:48,840
um,

2939
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:50,700
how do I call this loopholes?

2940
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:51,151
Are you,

2941
01:30:51,151 --> 01:30:53,160
I'm outing them or should
we not say their name?

2942
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:55,110
I won't say their names at the moment,

2943
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,240
but there are ways to do this.

2944
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:58,440
Then what's the point?

2945
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,760
You're the fucking bitcoin.

2946
01:30:59,761 --> 01:31:00,181
Jesus.

2947
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:01,110
If you don't say their names,

2948
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:03,510
they don't get promoted and
they fucking die on the vine.

2949
01:31:03,511 --> 01:31:04,470
You'll get pulled immediately.

2950
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:05,670
Well they get pulled immediately.

2951
01:31:05,671 --> 01:31:09,630
If you say their name Amy
later for Nintendo's like a
pop up almost every day on

2952
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:10,110
the story.

2953
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:13,000
It's like some backdoor into
something like food cooking programs.

2954
01:31:13,001 --> 01:31:13,834
People want,

2955
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:18,000
if people want to find bitcoin wallets
for I os they can search for those terms

2956
01:31:18,001 --> 01:31:18,834
and find them.

2957
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:24,800
And essentially the other way to do it
is by building a pure html five wallet,

2958
01:31:25,171 --> 01:31:26,760
the runs entirely in the browser.

2959
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,710
And then it's not an app you install,

2960
01:31:28,711 --> 01:31:29,850
it's a page you visit,

2961
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:31,020
but it's fully functional.

2962
01:31:31,021 --> 01:31:34,080
It looks like an application that
they have those we're building those.

2963
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:37,500
Every company in the space is building
one of those right now to avoid the whole

2964
01:31:37,501 --> 01:31:38,334
APP system,

2965
01:31:38,530 --> 01:31:39,270
uh,

2966
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:42,480
to get around the APP system and to enable
users to use it through the browser.

2967
01:31:42,540 --> 01:31:45,150
And you still have to use
Apple's browser though.

2968
01:31:45,151 --> 01:31:45,541
Correct?

2969
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:46,680
You can't use chrome yet.

2970
01:31:46,681 --> 01:31:48,330
Can you can use chrome for apple?

2971
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:50,783
Yeah.

2972
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:52,710
I have a chrome application.

2973
01:31:52,711 --> 01:31:54,810
They have Microsoft word now on Ios.

2974
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:55,720
Right.

2975
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,270
So any html five browser.

2976
01:31:57,271 --> 01:31:58,950
And that's the nice thing about html five.

2977
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,100
It's the new version of the web

2978
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:04,030
protocol and it will run on any browser
on any device and it will give you a

2979
01:32:04,031 --> 01:32:06,520
full app like experience.

2980
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:07,630
It doesn't feel like a webpage.

2981
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:09,430
It feels like an application.

2982
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:10,450
So That's interesting.

2983
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:11,290
Yeah,

2984
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:12,250
that's really interesting.

2985
01:32:12,251 --> 01:32:13,660
So that we'll cut it all out.

2986
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:16,180
If you can get online then
you can get to this web page,

2987
01:32:16,181 --> 01:32:17,740
then you can trade bitcoin period.

2988
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:19,150
So exactly.

2989
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:21,910
And this is what's exciting
about the bitcoin space for me,

2990
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:23,690
which is that uh,

2991
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:28,600
we talk about this idea that we're
going to convert dollars to bitcoin.

2992
01:32:28,601 --> 01:32:31,720
Like if only say Amazon adopts Bitcoin,

2993
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:36,690
then all of the stuff they're selling
through bitcoin will now be sold through a

2994
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:39,340
will that be solved through
bitcoin instead of dollars.

2995
01:32:39,341 --> 01:32:42,400
And it's like chewing
out little parts of the,

2996
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:45,700
of the traditional economy and just
converting it into a different currency.

2997
01:32:45,701 --> 01:32:47,050
And that is boring.

2998
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:47,891
It is.

2999
01:32:47,891 --> 01:32:49,000
So not the point.

3000
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:50,740
That's a bit like thinking that,

3001
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:51,760
you know,

3002
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:55,810
the Internet succeeds when all phone
calls happen on the Internet and we've

3003
01:32:55,811 --> 01:33:00,811
taken over the entire facts market and
now facts is dominated by Internet,

3004
01:33:02,441 --> 01:33:03,010
fax.

3005
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:05,740
And the whole point is that
it made facts irrelevant.

3006
01:33:05,741 --> 01:33:07,120
It didn't replace it,

3007
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:10,270
it made it irrelevant and it
didn't replace phone calls.

3008
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:14,350
It gave people better communication
tools and different communication tools.

3009
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:18,310
I'm more interested in what we can do
with bitcoin that can be done today rather

3010
01:33:18,311 --> 01:33:22,710
than replacing the things we already do
with dollars or visa and making a bet of

3011
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:23,160
visa,

3012
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:24,000
better pay pal,

3013
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:26,080
a better online shopping experience.

3014
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:27,280
That stuff is board.

3015
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:30,760
So here's what's happening
within the bitcoin economy,

3016
01:33:30,761 --> 01:33:34,150
there's now hundreds of startups
and they're hiring people.

3017
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:34,531
We're,

3018
01:33:34,531 --> 01:33:37,900
we have a jobs fair in
Sunnyvale on May 3rd,

3019
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:38,441
uh,

3020
01:33:38,441 --> 01:33:41,680
where we're going to have hundreds of
people and dozens of companies with job

3021
01:33:41,681 --> 01:33:42,580
open openings,

3022
01:33:42,581 --> 01:33:46,000
hiring developers and designers and
marketing professionals and all kinds of

3023
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:46,834
things like that.

3024
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:47,290
Now,

3025
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:47,620
uh,

3026
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:49,810
for those who are probably
new to this market,

3027
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,960
a jobs fair is this thing that happened
before 2008 where companies actually had

3028
01:33:55,631 --> 01:33:58,930
jobs and would come to
you in order to find you.

3029
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:00,163
Yes.

3030
01:34:00,490 --> 01:34:05,490
And we're doing this in bitcoin because
of this incredible spirit of innovation

3031
01:34:05,531 --> 01:34:06,490
that's been unleashed.

3032
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:11,580
So if you're an entrepreneur and you
look at these rough edges and you look at

3033
01:34:12,011 --> 01:34:13,540
these difficulties in the system,

3034
01:34:13,541 --> 01:34:16,330
and you'd look at the fact that it's
not ready for mainstream adoption,

3035
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:18,940
what you see as opportunity,

3036
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,100
massive opportunity.

3037
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:24,250
Because remember at first on the Internet,

3038
01:34:24,251 --> 01:34:25,360
you couldn't find anything.

3039
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:26,740
So someone said,

3040
01:34:26,741 --> 01:34:27,370
well,

3041
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,870
how about we build a search engine?

3042
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,680
And now that's a multi hundred
billion dollar company,

3043
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:33,670
right?

3044
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:34,930
And search became,

3045
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:35,411
uh,

3046
01:34:35,411 --> 01:34:39,610
an entire industry out
of a single problem.

3047
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:41,650
And the problem was you
couldn't find anything.

3048
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,060
Now you can find everything.

3049
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:44,830
And so at first people said,

3050
01:34:44,831 --> 01:34:45,011
well,

3051
01:34:45,011 --> 01:34:48,040
the Internet is never going to succeed
because you can't find anything on the

3052
01:34:48,041 --> 01:34:48,640
Internet.

3053
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:50,950
And smart entrepreneurs
took that problem and said,

3054
01:34:51,070 --> 01:34:51,520
no,

3055
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,840
if I solve this problem,

3056
01:34:52,841 --> 01:34:54,400
not only do I make the internet work,

3057
01:34:54,401 --> 01:34:56,410
but I also creates an
entirely new industry.

3058
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:57,500
So right now,

3059
01:34:57,501 --> 01:34:59,120
bitcoin is difficult to use.

3060
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,980
But if you solve that problem,

3061
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:06,590
if you take for example the fact that
a bitcoin addresses like a 37 character

3062
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:09,950
thing and it's unreadable
and you hide that,

3063
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,800
just like we no longer use
IP addresses on the Internet,

3064
01:35:12,801 --> 01:35:14,660
we use nice and easy to use names.

3065
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,160
We used to use,

3066
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:17,001
you know,

3067
01:35:17,001 --> 01:35:20,360
one nine two.one six
eight.zero.one and you had to,

3068
01:35:20,361 --> 01:35:22,760
I had the list in my
wallet of Ip addresses.

3069
01:35:22,761 --> 01:35:24,440
If I want it to go to
the Stanford website,

3070
01:35:24,441 --> 01:35:27,830
I had to pull out my wallet
and look up their Ip address.

3071
01:35:27,831 --> 01:35:31,310
That's how I used to work and there was
no way that was going to go mainstream.

3072
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:34,790
So each one of these problems,

3073
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:39,791
he's one of these rough edges is an
opportunity to create a whole new industry

3074
01:35:41,511 --> 01:35:45,590
that does things in a different way
that reinvents financial services in the

3075
01:35:45,591 --> 01:35:50,591
makes them new and innovative and
decentralized and enables things that have

3076
01:35:51,351 --> 01:35:52,310
never been done before.

3077
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:55,040
This is not about making a
better shopping experience.

3078
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,440
It's about doing things
we couldn't do before.

3079
01:35:58,130 --> 01:36:03,130
And eventually people are going to build
wallets that are very easy to use and

3080
01:36:03,381 --> 01:36:05,930
wallets that are going to be
very beautifully designed.

3081
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:10,990
And we're beginning to see that now as
all of these startups are rushing in to

3082
01:36:11,091 --> 01:36:12,110
fill in the gaps,

3083
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:17,180
to polish all the rough
edges and to deliver real
quality consumer products that

3084
01:36:17,181 --> 01:36:22,181
people can take this incredible underlying
power of bitcoin and turn it into an

3085
01:36:22,761 --> 01:36:26,000
everyday experience that a person who
doesn't want to know about any of the

3086
01:36:26,001 --> 01:36:27,350
geeky stuff about encryption,

3087
01:36:27,351 --> 01:36:27,951
about keys,

3088
01:36:27,951 --> 01:36:29,780
about all of that simply says,

3089
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:35,320
I want to send Joe some money and the
wallet is Joe Money Send and all of the

3090
01:36:37,551 --> 01:36:39,620
rest is hidden in the background
and we're getting there

3091
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,790
and we are getting there and it's,

3092
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:46,240
it sort of mirrors what's already been
done with the Internet so that people

3093
01:36:46,241 --> 01:36:47,260
could sort of see the path.

3094
01:36:47,261 --> 01:36:50,650
It's not like it's some completely new
thing that's never been done before.

3095
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:53,620
No one's ever taken something
that was unbelievably complex,

3096
01:36:53,621 --> 01:36:56,230
simplified it and made
it mainstream online.

3097
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:56,441
Yeah,

3098
01:36:56,441 --> 01:36:56,861
they have.

3099
01:36:56,861 --> 01:36:57,281
And they,

3100
01:36:57,281 --> 01:36:58,031
you could see it.

3101
01:36:58,031 --> 01:37:00,760
So with bitcoin it's like
the path has already lit.

3102
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:03,520
He just have to get people that
are brave enough to step forward.

3103
01:37:03,730 --> 01:37:05,080
And that's obviously happening

3104
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:07,010
except for one fundamental difference.

3105
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:11,450
We don't have to lay hundreds of
thousands of miles of new copper and fiber

3106
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:12,170
line,

3107
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:17,030
don't caption build the physical
infrastructure because it's already there.

3108
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:18,290
The Internet took,

3109
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:18,861
you know,

3110
01:37:18,861 --> 01:37:23,330
a decade and a half to spread in terms
of adoption and one of the big issues was

3111
01:37:23,331 --> 01:37:27,620
getting high speed Internet to enough
people and then getting fully on all the

3112
01:37:27,621 --> 01:37:28,454
time intranet.

3113
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:29,780
You remember the days of dialogue

3114
01:37:29,930 --> 01:37:31,520
and but modems going be

3115
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:38,360
right and to Carl London now,

3116
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:44,140
it was impossible to get my mom to do
email if she had to first turn on the

3117
01:37:44,211 --> 01:37:46,120
computer and log on Doubleclick,

3118
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:47,080
start the dialogue,

3119
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:49,070
do all of this with her phone.

3120
01:37:49,071 --> 01:37:52,520
That made her phone busy so she couldn't
actually use it and it would drop off

3121
01:37:52,521 --> 01:37:53,354
sometimes too.

3122
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:56,010
And then connect and
sync the EMA that are now

3123
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,030
she,

3124
01:37:57,030 --> 01:38:02,030
she swipes her iPad and the email is
there and she doesn't know how it works.

3125
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:03,570
All of this is always on.

3126
01:38:03,571 --> 01:38:04,170
It's Wifi,

3127
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:04,740
it's simple,

3128
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:05,041
boom,

3129
01:38:05,041 --> 01:38:05,874
done.

3130
01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:08,160
That's the progression we're going to see.

3131
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:09,870
That's fascinating.

3132
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,033
Um,

3133
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,710
what are right now as of today,

3134
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:14,250
what,

3135
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:17,640
what are the changes in bitcoin
since the last time you were on?

3136
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,070
Um,

3137
01:38:19,070 --> 01:38:21,090
there are some really
interesting things happening.

3138
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:21,953
I think,

3139
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:23,101
so,

3140
01:38:23,101 --> 01:38:23,934
let's see.

3141
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:25,050
It's been a while.

3142
01:38:25,051 --> 01:38:25,291
You know,

3143
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:25,501
in,

3144
01:38:25,501 --> 01:38:26,334
in,

3145
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:29,280
in real life it's been
two and a half months,

3146
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:32,280
which in bitcoin terms is
like two and a half years.

3147
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:34,470
So much has happened is just ridiculous.

3148
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:40,430
One of the interesting things we've
seen is serious efforts and results in

3149
01:38:40,441 --> 01:38:43,050
building multisignature capabilities.

3150
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:47,280
I don't think we even talked about
that last time or maybe we mentioned it

3151
01:38:47,281 --> 01:38:47,850
briefly.

3152
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:49,590
What is multisignature capabilities?

3153
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:51,990
So this is a feature that was
added to the core protocol,

3154
01:38:51,991 --> 01:38:56,640
the bitcoin protocol back in November
of 2013 officially and would work.

3155
01:38:56,820 --> 01:39:00,810
So when you send bitcoin to someone,

3156
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,510
what you're doing is almost
like signing a digital check.

3157
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:07,050
And you're saying from Joe Rogan's
wallets and you sign at the bottom to say,

3158
01:39:07,051 --> 01:39:07,261
yes,

3159
01:39:07,261 --> 01:39:09,630
I'm releasing this money to red band.

3160
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:10,171
Great.

3161
01:39:10,171 --> 01:39:13,440
So you've sent it and the bitcoin network
will look at that signature and say,

3162
01:39:13,441 --> 01:39:14,700
that's Joe Rogan signature.

3163
01:39:14,701 --> 01:39:15,061
Great.

3164
01:39:15,061 --> 01:39:16,740
So therefore now the
money belongs to read.

3165
01:39:16,741 --> 01:39:17,070
Ben,

3166
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:18,090
you've done the transaction.

3167
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:19,980
So what your wallet is doing,

3168
01:39:19,981 --> 01:39:23,760
what's your phone is doing when
it's sending bitcoins to someone?

3169
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:26,690
Is it signing a transaction
with your key to,

3170
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:27,511
to basically say,

3171
01:39:27,511 --> 01:39:28,500
I authorize this.

3172
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:30,270
Um,

3173
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:33,180
it takes one signature to release
the money from your law firm.

3174
01:39:33,181 --> 01:39:37,350
Your Wallet Multisig allows you to
build wallets that require multiple

3175
01:39:37,351 --> 01:39:38,184
signatures.

3176
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:43,230
So let's say you were running a company
and you want it to make sure that every

3177
01:39:43,231 --> 01:39:45,540
single time you made
a bitcoin transaction,

3178
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:50,720
it had to be signed by the CEO
and the chief financial officer,

3179
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:53,363
right?

3180
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:54,780
So now you could say,

3181
01:39:54,781 --> 01:39:55,141
well,

3182
01:39:55,141 --> 01:39:57,840
a requires two out of two signatures.

3183
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,170
The account has two
signatures associated with it.

3184
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:04,170
Both must sign in order to do that.

3185
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:08,730
Or You could create a joint account
between two spouses and you could say a

3186
01:40:08,731 --> 01:40:10,830
requires one of two signatures.

3187
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:14,700
Here is the signature of one spouse
has the signature of the other spouse.

3188
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,590
If either of them signs,

3189
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,160
you can do it right.

3190
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:19,320
Um,

3191
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:22,710
you could create a trust
account where you have,

3192
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:23,813
um,

3193
01:40:23,970 --> 01:40:27,330
either the signature of one spouse and
a trustee or the other spouse and a

3194
01:40:27,331 --> 01:40:30,720
trustee to sign off for
the account of a child.

3195
01:40:30,721 --> 01:40:31,554
For example,

3196
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:34,770
you could create an escrow
account where you say,

3197
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:39,800
I'm going to sell you Joe something
and you send me the bitcoin and I don't

3198
01:40:39,811 --> 01:40:40,644
deliver.

3199
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:42,360
What happens then that's a problem,

3200
01:40:42,361 --> 01:40:43,020
right?

3201
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:44,010
You can't get a refund.

3202
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:45,630
Now instead of that,

3203
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:49,680
you send the Bitcoin to an account
that requires to have three signatures,

3204
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:51,300
your signature,

3205
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:52,500
my signature,

3206
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,160
and an escrow party,

3207
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:57,190
a third party that works as
an arbitrator between us.

3208
01:40:57,610 --> 01:41:01,870
So if I send you the stuff that you
wanted and you are happy with it,

3209
01:41:02,350 --> 01:41:03,220
we both sign,

3210
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:04,383
I get the money,

3211
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:05,500
right?

3212
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:06,333
So you've paid me.

3213
01:41:06,410 --> 01:41:08,620
It's like an escrow like
you do with paypal and Ebay.

3214
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:10,900
Right now,

3215
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:12,160
if we have a dispute,

3216
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,490
you call the arbitrator and you say,

3217
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:20,470
I'm not happy I didn't get this product
and you and the arbitrator sign and get

3218
01:41:20,471 --> 01:41:21,220
the refund,

3219
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:22,270
send the money back to you.

3220
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:25,480
But if I'm not satisfied,

3221
01:41:25,481 --> 01:41:29,260
because I really did send you the product
and you just don't want to pay for it,

3222
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,390
I persuade the arbitrator
that you're cheating.

3223
01:41:32,230 --> 01:41:33,430
I sign it with the arbitrator.

3224
01:41:33,431 --> 01:41:34,600
Two out of three signatures,

3225
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:36,100
get the money to myself.

3226
01:41:36,101 --> 01:41:41,101
So you can create these complex
environments where you can do escrow,

3227
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,620
you can do trust accounts,

3228
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:45,280
you can have arbitration,

3229
01:41:45,281 --> 01:41:50,281
third party arbitration for refunds so
that you can solve problems and you can

3230
01:41:50,381 --> 01:41:54,670
create more complex forms of transactions
that give you better security and

3231
01:41:54,671 --> 01:41:55,504
better trust.

3232
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:56,181
That seems,

3233
01:41:56,181 --> 01:41:56,990
um,

3234
01:41:56,990 --> 01:41:59,320
like you would really have to
trust the arbitrator and the,

3235
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:03,950
they would have to somehow or another
not being cahoots with one party.

3236
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:04,570
Yeah.

3237
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:08,080
So when you use the visa network,

3238
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:10,510
you abide by visas,

3239
01:42:10,511 --> 01:42:11,470
arbitration rules,

3240
01:42:12,090 --> 01:42:12,670
right?

3241
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:16,510
So if you do a charge back and they're
going to contact the merchant and say,

3242
01:42:16,511 --> 01:42:16,661
well,

3243
01:42:16,661 --> 01:42:20,710
show us a signature from this transaction
and feess arbitration rules apply

3244
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:21,880
whether you'd like it or not.

3245
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:23,500
When you use Ebay,

3246
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:26,920
paypal arbitration rules apply
whether you like it or not,

3247
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:30,460
the means of payment determines
the rules of arbitration.

3248
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:35,400
So that seems like a good opportunity
for something like Bank of America to get

3249
01:42:35,401 --> 01:42:36,150
involved with.

3250
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:36,983
Yes.

3251
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:39,660
Paypal could be one of the
arbitrators if you'd like.

3252
01:42:40,110 --> 01:42:40,943
Oh thank you.

3253
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:41,970
If you like the,

3254
01:42:41,971 --> 01:42:42,360
uh,

3255
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:44,520
arbitration rules of that group,

3256
01:42:44,521 --> 01:42:45,354
you could use them.

3257
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:46,320
Here's the,

3258
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,400
here's the interesting things though.

3259
01:42:47,401 --> 01:42:49,170
What it does is it allows you to say,

3260
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:55,220
I'm going to have a market of arbitration
providers all with different rules and

3261
01:42:55,471 --> 01:42:56,550
different levels of trust.

3262
01:42:56,551 --> 01:43:00,570
And some of them will have very good
reviews because people had group could

3263
01:43:00,571 --> 01:43:03,360
experience with them and some of them are
specialized in real estate and some of

3264
01:43:03,361 --> 01:43:04,740
them are specialized in um,

3265
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,000
auction markets.

3266
01:43:06,001 --> 01:43:09,630
And some of them specialize in antiques
and some of them are specialized in art

3267
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:10,613
or appraisal.

3268
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:14,760
And so I'm doing a transaction with
you and I want to buy an antique.

3269
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:18,480
I'm going to list 200 antique arbitrators.

3270
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:20,790
I'm going to pick the one with
the highest level of refuse.

3271
01:43:20,791 --> 01:43:22,650
He's an experts in appraising antiques.

3272
01:43:22,651 --> 01:43:24,000
He's going to do a good job for us.

3273
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:24,601
We agree.

3274
01:43:24,601 --> 01:43:25,890
That's the one we want to use.

3275
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:26,910
Now we've got,

3276
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:30,990
it's opens up all of these possibilities
and it creates a whole new market for

3277
01:43:30,991 --> 01:43:31,890
these services.

3278
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:33,360
So you've taken trust.

3279
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:35,910
The was centralized in
someone like paypal.

3280
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,630
You didn't have a choice but to use their
arbitration and you decentralize it.

3281
01:43:39,631 --> 01:43:43,950
Tonight you have a market where the buyer
and the seller can decide what rules

3282
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:44,610
apply.

3283
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:47,700
So do you believe that this
is very similar to what we
were talking about before

3284
01:43:47,701 --> 01:43:48,271
with banks?

3285
01:43:48,271 --> 01:43:49,980
That one person just has to do it,

3286
01:43:49,981 --> 01:43:50,910
start profiting on it,

3287
01:43:50,911 --> 01:43:52,100
and the rush will be

3288
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:54,750
for all the other sort of
joining on the bandwagon?

3289
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:59,600
There's already an arbitration market
where lawyers and real estate agents and

3290
01:43:59,601 --> 01:44:04,370
others are providing arbitration services
for a small transaction fee like 0.1%

3291
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:08,390
of the transaction in order to
provide escrow capabilities.

3292
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:10,400
And you can do that when you
buy something with Bitcoin,

3293
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:13,820
you can now use escrow and this is all
within the last time you were here.

3294
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:14,780
Um,

3295
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:18,560
the technology was nascent and the
services were still being built and now

3296
01:44:18,561 --> 01:44:18,850
they're,

3297
01:44:18,850 --> 01:44:20,000
they're being built faster.

3298
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:22,790
So that two months
really is like two years.

3299
01:44:22,791 --> 01:44:23,300
Yeah.

3300
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:24,470
Let me give you another example,

3301
01:44:24,471 --> 01:44:25,430
which is really cool.

3302
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:29,540
A lot of people are worried about their
bitcoin being stolen from their wallets

3303
01:44:29,541 --> 01:44:30,530
because of a hack.

3304
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:33,500
So one of the ways you can use multisig,

3305
01:44:33,501 --> 01:44:34,790
which is very interesting,

3306
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:39,320
is to have a two have three account.

3307
01:44:39,410 --> 01:44:40,530
And what I mean by two of three,

3308
01:44:40,531 --> 01:44:45,170
it means it has three signatures
registered and you require at least two of

3309
01:44:45,171 --> 01:44:48,050
those three signatures in order
to authorize the transaction.

3310
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:50,090
You keep one,

3311
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,790
you keep another one as a backup,

3312
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:54,530
put it printed on paper,

3313
01:44:54,531 --> 01:44:55,341
put it in a safe,

3314
01:44:55,341 --> 01:44:57,980
that's your recovery in
case something goes wrong.

3315
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:02,600
And then you give the third signature to
a service that checks every transaction

3316
01:45:02,601 --> 01:45:03,434
for risk.

3317
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:06,110
And what they do is
when you make a payment,

3318
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:06,850
they,

3319
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:08,870
they look at the merchant that you paid,

3320
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:09,800
they look at their history,

3321
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:11,540
they look at what kind of amount it is.

3322
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:12,620
Is this usual,

3323
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:16,430
is it like $10 and you normally spend
that or did you just suddenly tried to

3324
01:45:16,431 --> 01:45:19,880
transfer half a million dollars out of
your accounts and wipe it clean to a

3325
01:45:19,881 --> 01:45:21,650
random address they've never seen before.

3326
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:23,090
And so based on that,

3327
01:45:23,091 --> 01:45:26,150
they're going to risk score it and
then they're going to call you,

3328
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:27,830
they're going to send you
a text message and say,

3329
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:29,570
we seeing a transaction here,

3330
01:45:29,571 --> 01:45:32,720
you've requested for two and a half
thousand dollars to merchant we've never

3331
01:45:32,721 --> 01:45:34,430
seen before that you normally don't do.

3332
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:36,050
Are you sure you know,

3333
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:38,540
respond one for authorizing
this transaction,

3334
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:39,890
respond to to cancel it.

3335
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:42,430
And if it's a really big one,

3336
01:45:42,431 --> 01:45:44,890
maybe they're going to call you on the
phone and you're going to speak to Jim

3337
01:45:44,891 --> 01:45:45,850
and Jim is going to say,

3338
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:46,440
um,

3339
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:48,370
can you please give me the
last four of your social,

3340
01:45:48,371 --> 01:45:49,210
I want to check this,

3341
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:50,140
whatever you can,

3342
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:55,710
you can reintroduce some of the fraud
prevention systems that banks do.

3343
01:45:56,710 --> 01:46:00,850
But the really cool thing is now that's
a market instead of having to do it with

3344
01:46:00,851 --> 01:46:02,080
your payment provider,

3345
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:04,300
you can pick who gives you a risk service.

3346
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:06,730
Yeah,

3347
01:46:06,730 --> 01:46:07,610
it's fascinating,

3348
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:12,611
but it's sort of along the same lines
of the difference between apple locking

3349
01:46:12,831 --> 01:46:13,700
everything down.

3350
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:14,301
You know,

3351
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:15,134
it's secure.

3352
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:19,610
You're not going to get a virus from
an APP and the wild world of like,

3353
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:25,720
like say perfect example
would be like a bit torrent.

3354
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:26,560
Yes.

3355
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,840
Fucking download a
program from bit torrent.

3356
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:29,890
Good lucks on.

3357
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:32,200
Better Cross your fingers
because you never know.

3358
01:46:32,201 --> 01:46:33,160
What the hell are you going to get?

3359
01:46:33,161 --> 01:46:33,880
Right?

3360
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:34,720
So here's the thing.

3361
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:35,410
I mean,

3362
01:46:35,410 --> 01:46:35,751
by the way,

3363
01:46:35,751 --> 01:46:37,240
these pickles are God damn delicious.

3364
01:46:37,241 --> 01:46:39,940
If you want to pick over
Grillo's pickles sent us some,

3365
01:46:39,941 --> 01:46:40,150
uh,

3366
01:46:40,150 --> 01:46:41,350
some pickles are amazing.

3367
01:46:41,351 --> 01:46:42,340
Have you had the sweet ones?

3368
01:46:42,370 --> 01:46:42,920
Yes.

3369
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,530
If my favorite one one.

3370
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:46,310
Can you now come to normal Joe,

3371
01:46:46,311 --> 01:46:49,040
go over and buy Grillo's
pickles or is there a website?

3372
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:50,130
Is it just like local

3373
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:50,460
shit?

3374
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:50,870
Only.

3375
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:51,360
Only people.

3376
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:51,631
Yeah.

3377
01:46:51,631 --> 01:46:51,811
No,

3378
01:46:51,811 --> 01:46:52,710
you can get them delivered.

3379
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,360
Grillo's pickles.com delivers.

3380
01:46:54,361 --> 01:46:56,700
Now they're the nicest guys that were too.

3381
01:46:56,701 --> 01:46:58,440
They came to our show
in Boston and they were,

3382
01:46:58,450 --> 01:47:00,240
if he gave out free
pickles to the whole crowd,

3383
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:00,871
dude,

3384
01:47:00,871 --> 01:47:03,690
probably like a million dollars for
the pickles and handed it out to 2000

3385
01:47:03,691 --> 01:47:04,380
people.

3386
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:05,213
It's all fresh jail.

3387
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:06,263
They take bitcoin,

3388
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:09,810
they should those pickles
good on the ball badge.

3389
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:12,330
You shouldn't really start bitcoin now.

3390
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:12,721
Right?

3391
01:47:12,721 --> 01:47:12,851
Like,

3392
01:47:12,851 --> 01:47:14,220
like if I wanted to buy Bitcoin,

3393
01:47:14,221 --> 01:47:15,930
I wouldn't want to start now.

3394
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:18,690
I would wait when await because
I'm not going to spend what,

3395
01:47:18,691 --> 01:47:21,000
$500 for a single bitcoin.

3396
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:22,560
Can you buy pieces of Bitcoin?

3397
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:24,710
You can buy first small amounts we can.

3398
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:25,613
Where do you do that?

3399
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:27,241
So most of the,

3400
01:47:27,241 --> 01:47:27,690
uh,

3401
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:30,270
most of the exchanges or place
where you can buy Bitcoin,

3402
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:31,380
you can probably buy like,

3403
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:34,320
I think the minimum is $20
for something like that worth.

3404
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:35,490
Okay.

3405
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:36,350
So you can buy a,

3406
01:47:36,430 --> 01:47:37,980
a 20th of a bitcoin.

3407
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:39,931
Theoretically,

3408
01:47:39,931 --> 01:47:43,170
you could go and buy a hundred millions
of a bitcoin if somebody who was willing

3409
01:47:43,171 --> 01:47:43,771
to sell it to you.

3410
01:47:43,771 --> 01:47:44,051
But the,

3411
01:47:44,051 --> 01:47:44,820
usually the,

3412
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:47,370
it's not worth doing
for them at that amount.

3413
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:48,663
Um,

3414
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:50,610
so you can divide it as much as he wants.

3415
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:51,060
It's,

3416
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:53,520
you do not need to spend
an enormous amount.

3417
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:55,110
And then again,

3418
01:47:55,111 --> 01:47:56,790
the thing is what are
you gonna use it for?

3419
01:47:56,791 --> 01:47:57,120
If you,

3420
01:47:57,120 --> 01:48:00,090
if you're going to try and use
bitcoin to invest in Bitcoin,

3421
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:00,871
be very,

3422
01:48:00,871 --> 01:48:01,704
very careful.

3423
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:06,990
Do not take your retirement funds and
all of your savings and dump them into

3424
01:48:06,991 --> 01:48:09,390
this wild ride that is not smart.

3425
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:10,020
Right?

3426
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:11,550
And I need to say that again and again.

3427
01:48:11,551 --> 01:48:12,720
People don't do that.

3428
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:13,830
I mean,

3429
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:16,500
I've done some of that
and it's not prudent,

3430
01:48:16,501 --> 01:48:19,380
but my career is tied to this.

3431
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,640
I'm in the industry,

3432
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,950
this is not for the mainstream investor.

3433
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:24,810
And it's not really an investment,

3434
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,310
but I'm sorry,

3435
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:27,323
who's cool.

3436
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:32,540
Maybe put a couple of percentage points
of a nicely diversified portfolio like

3437
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:33,001
that.

3438
01:48:33,001 --> 01:48:33,601
I'll throw,

3439
01:48:33,601 --> 01:48:33,871
you know,

3440
01:48:33,871 --> 01:48:36,600
$1,000 maybe $2,000 if I lose it,

3441
01:48:36,601 --> 01:48:37,231
I lose it.

3442
01:48:37,231 --> 01:48:37,831
If I don't,

3443
01:48:37,831 --> 01:48:39,130
in the meantime I can play with it.

3444
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:40,380
I can buy a bit of bit coin,

3445
01:48:40,410 --> 01:48:41,850
learn about the technology,

3446
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:44,040
feel like I'm part of
an early adopter thing.

3447
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:45,143
That's cool.

3448
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:46,980
Don't go putting all
your money in bitcoin.

3449
01:48:46,981 --> 01:48:47,814
That's not smart.

3450
01:48:47,970 --> 01:48:48,451
What happened?

3451
01:48:48,451 --> 01:48:53,451
That one dude who had like $9 million in
bitcoin in a hard drive and he couldn't

3452
01:48:53,461 --> 01:48:54,060
find it,

3453
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:57,480
so he was going to the dump with a fine
tooth comb trying to figure out where

3454
01:48:57,481 --> 01:48:58,470
that hard drive was.

3455
01:48:58,870 --> 01:48:59,703
Do you remember that story?

3456
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:00,120
Yeah.

3457
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:01,990
Well fortunately he
didn't buy that bitcoin.

3458
01:49:02,010 --> 01:49:06,300
He was just one of the people who were
involved in mining several years back and

3459
01:49:06,301 --> 01:49:09,320
then he forgot about it and
then he realized this whole
hard drive heats thrown

3460
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:09,520
away.

3461
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12,360
Ashley had a wallet which had seven
and a half thousand bitcoin on it or

3462
01:49:12,361 --> 01:49:13,194
something like that.

3463
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:15,450
It's hilarious by the way.

3464
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:16,380
But it's no loss.

3465
01:49:16,410 --> 01:49:19,350
You're going to have treasure
hunters as a new occupation.

3466
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:22,200
It's no loss because he
didn't actually have it.

3467
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:22,621
You know,

3468
01:49:22,621 --> 01:49:23,130
he didn't.

3469
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:23,963
He didn't.

3470
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:24,810
Um,

3471
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:25,740
but if he had it,

3472
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:26,603
he would have it.

3473
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:28,050
It could be a gain loss.

3474
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:28,973
Yes.

3475
01:49:29,010 --> 01:49:29,843
It's a fucking law.

3476
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:30,420
Yeah.

3477
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:32,460
It's not going to keep the
dude from committing suicide.

3478
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:33,330
Well,

3479
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:33,910
um,

3480
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:34,170
Eh,

3481
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:37,620
I think it's going to create a
whole new treasure hunting business.

3482
01:49:37,621 --> 01:49:38,760
People are going to start,

3483
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:39,180
um,

3484
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:40,290
and already we've seen this.

3485
01:49:40,291 --> 01:49:42,420
People buy old computers on Ebay.

3486
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:47,220
Go through the hard drives and find
wallets on them or porn or financial

3487
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:48,153
information.

3488
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:49,240
Identity theft.

3489
01:49:49,410 --> 01:49:49,870
Yeah.

3490
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:50,021
Yeah.

3491
01:49:50,021 --> 01:49:50,590
You got to be,

3492
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:51,850
people need to know that too.

3493
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:52,930
If you get rid of a hard drive,

3494
01:49:52,931 --> 01:49:54,710
you've got to wipe that
bitch clean a strike.

3495
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:55,600
You have to do more than that.

3496
01:49:55,630 --> 01:49:55,931
Like you,

3497
01:49:55,931 --> 01:49:57,200
you gave me a bunch of
your hard drives out,

3498
01:49:57,210 --> 01:49:57,851
wipe them clean by.

3499
01:49:57,851 --> 01:50:00,400
Still didn't throw them away because I
know that there's programs out there that

3500
01:50:00,401 --> 01:50:01,121
could just do that.

3501
01:50:01,121 --> 01:50:02,170
So now I'm thinking like,

3502
01:50:02,230 --> 01:50:02,661
what do you do?

3503
01:50:02,661 --> 01:50:05,110
You just dip them in acid
or we should shoot him.

3504
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:06,500
Take him to the place sheet.

3505
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:07,270
That'd be fine.

3506
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:07,681
Let's do it.

3507
01:50:07,681 --> 01:50:08,110
Let's do it.

3508
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:08,620
Alright,

3509
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:11,770
well we're having this
conversation at the very moment.

3510
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:13,000
We're having this conversation,

3511
01:50:13,001 --> 01:50:15,340
like my watch keeps
buzzing every now and then.

3512
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:16,810
What do you got on your watch?

3513
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:18,010
It's a pebble.

3514
01:50:18,010 --> 01:50:19,450
It's a smartwatch.

3515
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:19,691
Oh,

3516
01:50:19,691 --> 01:50:20,411
how dare you.

3517
01:50:20,411 --> 01:50:21,280
You're one of those guys.

3518
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:21,611
Well,

3519
01:50:21,611 --> 01:50:22,530
I'm getting Bitcoin,

3520
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:26,470
not notifications of people tipping
me over Twitter as we're speaking.

3521
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:27,641
Very,

3522
01:50:27,641 --> 01:50:28,091
very cool.

3523
01:50:28,091 --> 01:50:29,740
I'm sitting here and as I say things,

3524
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:30,160
if,

3525
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:33,820
if I say something that people like my
watch buzzes a bit because people start

3526
01:50:33,821 --> 01:50:34,654
sending me tips.

3527
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:37,210
So that's pretty cool.

3528
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:38,140
That's pretty cool.

3529
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:39,460
And now it's buzzing lots.

3530
01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:41,080
Once I said deal from you,

3531
01:50:41,081 --> 01:50:41,621
can they be like,

3532
01:50:41,621 --> 01:50:42,221
fuck you?

3533
01:50:42,221 --> 01:50:43,660
Can you get like a negative shock?

3534
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:45,460
Could you say something stupid?

3535
01:50:45,461 --> 01:50:46,750
Are you willing to take a chance?

3536
01:50:47,050 --> 01:50:48,640
I think that's a,

3537
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:49,001
again,

3538
01:50:49,001 --> 01:50:49,481
that's what I said.

3539
01:50:49,481 --> 01:50:50,350
If you're an entrepreneur,

3540
01:50:50,351 --> 01:50:51,550
there was an opportunity.

3541
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,040
Yeah.

3542
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:53,873
Yeah.

3543
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:56,980
Pay someone to wear a shock
collar that's written by Bitcoin.

3544
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:58,860
So I got my blocked,

3545
01:50:58,870 --> 01:50:59,381
I just read,

3546
01:50:59,381 --> 01:51:02,500
downloaded my blockchain app and uh,

3547
01:51:02,501 --> 01:51:02,791
and,

3548
01:51:02,791 --> 01:51:03,101
and you know,

3549
01:51:03,101 --> 01:51:04,390
just checking to see I,

3550
01:51:04,570 --> 01:51:06,310
what number am I,

3551
01:51:06,311 --> 01:51:07,150
should I give out?

3552
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:07,931
People were like,

3553
01:51:07,931 --> 01:51:08,261
Brian,

3554
01:51:08,261 --> 01:51:09,300
what's your number?

3555
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:10,930
Address this address right here,

3556
01:51:11,450 --> 01:51:11,680
right.

3557
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:12,190
This is,

3558
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:13,760
there's no dangers of giving her,

3559
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:14,613
people were telling me,

3560
01:51:14,630 --> 01:51:14,770
oh,

3561
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:16,330
it's like giving out your email address.

3562
01:51:16,490 --> 01:51:17,020
Okay.

3563
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:20,530
Better actually because it doesn't reveal
any information about where you are or

3564
01:51:20,531 --> 01:51:21,970
who you are or any of that.

3565
01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:22,330
Okay.

3566
01:51:22,330 --> 01:51:24,460
Well it allows people
to do is send you money.

3567
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:25,533
Sweet.

3568
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:27,070
And that's nice because you can,

3569
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:28,630
you can put that down on the tee shirt.

3570
01:51:28,631 --> 01:51:29,680
You can put it on a QR code.

3571
01:51:29,681 --> 01:51:29,921
In fact,

3572
01:51:29,921 --> 01:51:34,921
there was this guy who went to a football
game with a giant Qr code date printed

3573
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:39,250
and during the ESPN coverage
when they were on the Jumbo Tron,

3574
01:51:39,251 --> 01:51:40,240
they held it up and it said,

3575
01:51:40,241 --> 01:51:41,920
pay for my college or something like that.

3576
01:51:42,490 --> 01:51:44,880
They made like two and a half grand or in,

3577
01:51:44,930 --> 01:51:47,650
in a matter of minutes because
people would see it on TV,

3578
01:51:47,651 --> 01:51:49,480
take a snapshot and send
them a little bit coin.

3579
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:50,770
Wow.

3580
01:51:51,190 --> 01:51:51,850
Why not?

3581
01:51:51,850 --> 01:51:56,230
There's a congressman who went to a recent
meeting wearing a sandwich board with

3582
01:51:56,231 --> 01:51:59,310
a Qr Code on the front where
you could donate bid bitcoin to.

3583
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:00,730
Wow.

3584
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:01,870
It's perfectly safe.

3585
01:52:01,871 --> 01:52:02,561
You could publish that.

3586
01:52:02,561 --> 01:52:04,600
You can put it on posters
around the city if he wants to.

3587
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,433
My tweet it right now.

3588
01:52:05,470 --> 01:52:06,700
That's fantastic.

3589
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:07,870
That's when to Joe.

3590
01:52:08,050 --> 01:52:11,830
So many people ask me for your bitcoin
address so they could send you bitcoin.

3591
01:52:13,050 --> 01:52:15,430
Tell me what it is if you
still have the application.

3592
01:52:15,431 --> 01:52:16,061
Absolutely.

3593
01:52:16,061 --> 01:52:16,870
Yeah.

3594
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:17,703
We'll give it out.

3595
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:18,633
We'll see what happens.

3596
01:52:18,670 --> 01:52:20,290
If somebody sent me one too and I'm like,

3597
01:52:20,291 --> 01:52:21,180
how the fuck did you begin?

3598
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:22,960
I know it's really funny.

3599
01:52:22,961 --> 01:52:23,590
The the,

3600
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:23,860
the,

3601
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:25,300
the watch is buzzing all the time.

3602
01:52:25,850 --> 01:52:26,560
Watch.

3603
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:27,101
I'm not a,

3604
01:52:27,101 --> 01:52:28,990
I'm not a big fan of
that Dick Tracy Watch.

3605
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:30,190
That shit's ridiculous.

3606
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:31,960
I only use it.

3607
01:52:31,961 --> 01:52:35,350
You don't want to use it for most of the
time for notifications on trip it when

3608
01:52:35,351 --> 01:52:36,660
I'm traveling it tells you like,

3609
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:39,460
and it goes gate change
and I don't miss my flight.

3610
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:40,030
I mean that,

3611
01:52:40,030 --> 01:52:41,200
that's useful.

3612
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:42,020
Yeah.

3613
01:52:42,020 --> 01:52:43,780
I heard the pebbles the
best one out right now.

3614
01:52:43,930 --> 01:52:45,980
Still quite new them songs.

3615
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:47,060
I'm enjoying it a lot.

3616
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:47,540
Yeah.

3617
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:51,290
What's the difference between the
Samsungs and the pebble and I don't know.

3618
01:52:51,291 --> 01:52:54,680
I got this as a gift a and just the only
one I've ever used and I'm just still

3619
01:52:54,681 --> 01:52:55,514
playing with it.

3620
01:52:55,910 --> 01:53:00,080
So here's something weird that happened
to me after the first Joe Rogan my

3621
01:53:00,081 --> 01:53:00,810
thing.

3622
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:01,091
Yet.

3623
01:53:01,091 --> 01:53:01,701
You still got it.

3624
01:53:01,701 --> 01:53:03,580
There are just like
somebody sent me one too.

3625
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:05,000
Yeah,

3626
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:09,060
right after I got some big in
front of a camera with that.

3627
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:10,460
How will that work?

3628
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:12,650
People can see the Qr Code on,

3629
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:13,730
on your phone.

3630
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:16,820
You can hold it up to the camera that's
pointing at me over there behind you

3631
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:18,850
and,

3632
01:53:18,850 --> 01:53:21,740
and that will and uh,

3633
01:53:22,670 --> 01:53:25,400
is that going to work
there you go right there.

3634
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:26,180
Once the,

3635
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:26,450
yeah,

3636
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:28,430
once the brightness that's good.

3637
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:29,390
Stabilizes.

3638
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:29,781
Yeah,

3639
01:53:29,781 --> 01:53:32,240
but you can publish that
address and that's a,

3640
01:53:32,241 --> 01:53:34,370
that's Joe Rogan's bitcoin
address right there.

3641
01:53:34,370 --> 01:53:37,970
And hopefully you can say
hello to Joe with money

3642
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:42,470
and you can publish it later
and you can just copy that,

3643
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:45,200
put it in an email or
give me any real money.

3644
01:53:45,201 --> 01:53:46,550
I'll donate it to charity by the way.

3645
01:53:46,770 --> 01:53:47,420
Yeah,

3646
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:48,620
just to let you know that's,

3647
01:53:48,621 --> 01:53:50,720
that's always a good thing
to do and by the way,

3648
01:53:50,721 --> 01:53:52,310
charity is,

3649
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:57,380
has become one of the dominant
forms of payments in bitcoin.

3650
01:53:57,740 --> 01:54:01,940
A lot of people who are doing a lot with
charity and it's because you can send

3651
01:54:01,941 --> 01:54:03,020
money very quickly.

3652
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:05,330
You can see how the money is being spent.

3653
01:54:05,630 --> 01:54:08,240
There's this fantastic charity
that I'd like to mention,

3654
01:54:08,450 --> 01:54:09,800
which is based in Pensacola,

3655
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:10,490
Florida,

3656
01:54:10,490 --> 01:54:14,000
where they've made it pretty
much illegal to be homeless,

3657
01:54:14,210 --> 01:54:19,210
the first band sleeping outdoors than
they banned blankets and they tried to

3658
01:54:19,941 --> 01:54:23,550
solve the homeless problem by bossing
them into other cities around and kick

3659
01:54:23,551 --> 01:54:24,860
them out of the area.

3660
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:25,521
I support that.

3661
01:54:25,521 --> 01:54:26,220
How do we do that?

3662
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:29,180
Sweet Brian,

3663
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:30,650
you've missed the point.

3664
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:32,510
The point is that's evil.

3665
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:34,100
Those poor people are poor.

3666
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:34,821
Actually.

3667
01:54:34,821 --> 01:54:38,390
Most of them are veterans coming back
from the war and having no jobs in having

3668
01:54:38,391 --> 01:54:40,760
PTSD and no treatments and I
don't know if most of them,

3669
01:54:40,761 --> 01:54:45,761
but there are quite a few 40% 40% of the
homeless population in this country is

3670
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:47,390
made up of veterans.

3671
01:54:47,690 --> 01:54:48,500
That's a shame.

3672
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:49,011
So,

3673
01:54:49,011 --> 01:54:49,460
uh,

3674
01:54:49,460 --> 01:54:54,460
Jason King from Sean's outpost children's
health post.com started collecting

3675
01:54:54,801 --> 01:54:59,600
money for with bitcoin and use that
money last year in the first year of the

3676
01:54:59,601 --> 01:55:04,190
charity to feed 60,000 meals to
the homeless people of Pensacola,

3677
01:55:04,191 --> 01:55:05,000
Florida.

3678
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,080
And managed to create fundraising
events from all around the world and to

3679
01:55:09,081 --> 01:55:14,081
convert that money very effectively into
food for people who desperately needed.

3680
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:15,320
And that's just one example,

3681
01:55:15,321 --> 01:55:19,100
is a lot of charity a bit
give the bit gift foundation,

3682
01:55:19,101 --> 01:55:22,610
which coordinates charitable
giving a hundred bitcoins,

3683
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:27,640
which is a charity that will literally
give a 100 bitcoins to any charity that

3684
01:55:27,950 --> 01:55:29,060
wants to take bitcoin.

3685
01:55:29,061 --> 01:55:29,870
They already have,

3686
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:32,300
they've raised the money and now they're
trying to find charities to give the

3687
01:55:32,301 --> 01:55:33,110
money away to.

3688
01:55:33,110 --> 01:55:33,943
How can I,

3689
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:36,170
I mean that was just an image.

3690
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:38,000
That thing was just an image.

3691
01:55:38,230 --> 01:55:39,720
The the the Bitcoin,

3692
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:40,380
the Barcode.

3693
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:40,530
Yeah,

3694
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:41,363
whatever it is.

3695
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:42,440
How do you,

3696
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:43,950
how would I put that online

3697
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:45,090
so I can,

3698
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:45,923
I can,

3699
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:48,200
I've received one screenshot.

3700
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:51,560
I've received one w o 0.01

3701
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:57,260
it's already happening approximately
$4 and 92 cents for 20 years.

3702
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:57,951
Oh Shit.

3703
01:55:57,951 --> 01:55:58,940
My phone's blowing up.

3704
01:55:59,570 --> 01:56:04,570
This has got five bitcoins or five
donations just from that stupid image.

3705
01:56:05,931 --> 01:56:06,770
That's incredible.

3706
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,570
What if I put that image online?

3707
01:56:08,571 --> 01:56:10,940
How do you make a screenshot
with an android phone?

3708
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:12,321
I can,

3709
01:56:12,321 --> 01:56:15,680
I can send you a Qr Code that corresponds
to your address is fairly easy for me

3710
01:56:15,681 --> 01:56:16,401
to generate it.

3711
01:56:16,401 --> 01:56:20,450
You can share that Qr code through the
application or you can just post the

3712
01:56:20,451 --> 01:56:21,470
address above it.

3713
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:23,330
The QR code is just the address.

3714
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:26,540
It's the same number
that starts with a one.

3715
01:56:26,541 --> 01:56:29,520
That long series of digits is
just in the form of a barcode.

3716
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:30,373
To make it easier,

3717
01:56:31,230 --> 01:56:33,720
I need to find out how you
screenshot with the galaxy.

3718
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:34,470
Note three.

3719
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:35,490
I use mine I,

3720
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:36,570
there's different ways you can do it.

3721
01:56:36,571 --> 01:56:36,811
Mine,

3722
01:56:36,811 --> 01:56:41,170
I just swipe my hand from left or
right eye over the screen and I do the

3723
01:56:41,171 --> 01:56:41,761
screenshot,

3724
01:56:41,761 --> 01:56:41,961
but I,

3725
01:56:41,961 --> 01:56:44,670
I think I chose to do
that through the sections.

3726
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,073
Hmm.

3727
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:47,191
There's gotta be a way,

3728
01:56:47,191 --> 01:56:48,024
right?

3729
01:56:48,030 --> 01:56:48,863
Yeah.

3730
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:51,270
But there's got to be like an easier way.

3731
01:56:51,330 --> 01:56:51,590
Yeah.

3732
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:53,250
Was like a button you press
or something like that.

3733
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:54,180
Open settings,

3734
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:55,830
motions and gestures.

3735
01:56:55,860 --> 01:56:55,981
Oh,

3736
01:56:55,981 --> 01:56:56,970
that's the only way to do it.

3737
01:56:58,230 --> 01:56:59,063
Huh?

3738
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:00,660
That's s five.

3739
01:57:00,661 --> 01:57:01,494
It doesn't always work.

3740
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:01,850
Yeah.

3741
01:57:01,850 --> 01:57:03,540
But before we're done with the show,

3742
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:03,730
uh,

3743
01:57:03,730 --> 01:57:06,570
I'll get that barcode ready for you.

3744
01:57:06,571 --> 01:57:08,700
You could post it on this
show and see what happens.

3745
01:57:08,860 --> 01:57:09,171
Okay.

3746
01:57:09,171 --> 01:57:13,010
You press the power button and
the home button at the same time.

3747
01:57:13,730 --> 01:57:14,130
Power.

3748
01:57:14,130 --> 01:57:15,740
But so how did he get those?

3749
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:17,990
How did he get that cool bar on his,

3750
01:57:19,190 --> 01:57:19,790
the Barcode?

3751
01:57:19,790 --> 01:57:20,060
Yeah.

3752
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:22,790
You just touched the Barcode on the
home screen of your application.

3753
01:57:22,910 --> 01:57:23,640
Okay.

3754
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:23,990
All right.

3755
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:24,521
I'm going to it.

3756
01:57:24,521 --> 01:57:25,354
We'll make it bigger.

3757
01:57:25,370 --> 01:57:27,050
I'm going to send this image,

3758
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:32,060
I'm going to put it on Instagram
and then we'll see what's up.

3759
01:57:34,190 --> 01:57:35,660
Let's see if this does something.

3760
01:57:37,850 --> 01:57:40,580
If you click on the receive button,

3761
01:57:40,990 --> 01:57:41,510
right Ben?

3762
01:57:41,510 --> 01:57:42,343
Yeah.

3763
01:57:42,470 --> 01:57:44,570
And then I think it's one
of the tabs at the bottom.

3764
01:57:44,571 --> 01:57:45,404
And then

3765
01:57:48,230 --> 01:57:48,710
when you do,

3766
01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:49,220
you've got the,

3767
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:49,491
yeah.

3768
01:57:49,491 --> 01:57:53,120
The problem is they won't let us make
new iPhone application as is lagging

3769
01:57:53,121 --> 01:57:53,850
behind.

3770
01:57:53,850 --> 01:57:54,111
I mean,

3771
01:57:54,111 --> 01:57:54,570
there you go.

3772
01:57:54,570 --> 01:57:55,041
Stay still.

3773
01:57:55,041 --> 01:57:56,090
Let me download it though,

3774
01:57:56,091 --> 01:57:59,690
because I got a new iPhone the other day
and they still let me download the old

3775
01:57:59,691 --> 01:58:01,250
program off the iTunes store.

3776
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:01,950
Oh,

3777
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,650
maybe because you already
had it on your iTunes.

3778
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:04,790
If you already own something,

3779
01:58:04,791 --> 01:58:05,511
you are still allowed to,

3780
01:58:05,511 --> 01:58:05,650
right.

3781
01:58:05,650 --> 01:58:06,670
Redownload it for somehow.

3782
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:07,913
Hmm.

3783
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:09,010
Really?

3784
01:58:09,010 --> 01:58:09,250
Yeah.

3785
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:10,750
So even if it's gone.

3786
01:58:10,780 --> 01:58:11,440
Yeah.

3787
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:12,460
That's interesting.

3788
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:12,671
Yeah.

3789
01:58:12,671 --> 01:58:13,241
It's kind of like,

3790
01:58:13,241 --> 01:58:15,130
so people that spent money on something,

3791
01:58:15,131 --> 01:58:15,530
they are,

3792
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:17,980
they still own that product so
they can't really take it away.

3793
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:18,611
Okay.

3794
01:58:18,611 --> 01:58:20,290
I just instagrammed it,

3795
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:23,500
which means it also went to
my Twitter and my Facebook.

3796
01:58:23,501 --> 01:58:28,210
So almost 2 million people have
access to that image right now.

3797
01:58:28,211 --> 01:58:29,650
Let's see if my phone exploded.

3798
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:31,671
I've,

3799
01:58:31,671 --> 01:58:32,031
I've,

3800
01:58:32,031 --> 01:58:33,680
I've had that happen with an explosive,

3801
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:36,680
let me tell you a great story
of a fundraising using bitcoin.

3802
01:58:37,370 --> 01:58:40,970
Did you hear about this story with
music week where they came out and said,

3803
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:42,130
we found the

3804
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,120
creator of Bitcoin?

3805
01:58:43,230 --> 01:58:43,531
Yeah.

3806
01:58:43,531 --> 01:58:44,364
The Comodo

3807
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:46,470
the thing I wanted to talk
to you about most today.

3808
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:47,333
Great.

3809
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:48,840
I have a great story for you,

3810
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:52,470
exactly about what happens and we've
got a video online to share as well.

3811
01:58:52,510 --> 01:58:53,343
Okay.

3812
01:58:53,490 --> 01:58:57,750
So I was a conference the morning I
found out about this and I looked into it

3813
01:58:57,751 --> 01:59:01,890
and a lot of people in the bitcoin space
are interested in who Satoshi Nakamoto

3814
01:59:01,891 --> 01:59:02,041
is.

3815
01:59:02,041 --> 01:59:03,600
There have been a lot of research.

3816
01:59:03,930 --> 01:59:07,830
I think we should leave the person alone
and it's probably not going to be good

3817
01:59:07,831 --> 01:59:10,740
to find out who it is because all
it's gonna do is smear that person.

3818
01:59:11,370 --> 01:59:13,080
They're going to try and smear him.

3819
01:59:13,110 --> 01:59:15,840
So I would rather not know
because it doesn't matter.

3820
01:59:15,841 --> 01:59:17,430
It's the math is what matters,

3821
01:59:17,431 --> 01:59:18,330
not who it is,

3822
01:59:19,170 --> 01:59:22,080
but people are all variously curious.

3823
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:23,213
Um,

3824
01:59:24,030 --> 01:59:25,470
when I found out about this,

3825
01:59:25,471 --> 01:59:25,710
uh,

3826
01:59:25,710 --> 01:59:30,710
person in the Los Angeles area that
was fingered by Newsweek as a Satoshi

3827
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:32,670
Nakamoto,

3828
01:59:32,670 --> 01:59:33,240
then,

3829
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:33,451
uh,

3830
01:59:33,451 --> 01:59:33,991
and by the way,

3831
01:59:33,991 --> 01:59:37,500
I don't want to create more publicity
for this poor man because he is not

3832
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:41,970
Satoshi and it's been
become abundantly clear.

3833
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:42,780
Uh,

3834
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:46,470
we've got a lot of writing by the
original creator of Bitcoin and it doesn't

3835
01:59:46,471 --> 01:59:49,400
match any of the style of it.

3836
01:59:49,490 --> 01:59:50,440
Beginning of tone of scion,

3837
01:59:50,490 --> 01:59:52,490
constant vibrate right now,

3838
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:53,480
let's US listen.

3839
01:59:57,880 --> 01:59:59,020
It's just constantly vibrating.

3840
01:59:59,740 --> 02:00:00,491
Make it happen.

3841
02:00:00,491 --> 02:00:01,450
Bitcoin community.

3842
02:00:01,451 --> 02:00:02,231
I'm counting on you.

3843
02:00:02,231 --> 02:00:04,030
That's all big coin come in and right now.

3844
02:00:04,050 --> 02:00:04,420
Yeah.

3845
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:06,610
Dollar dollar bills y'all.

3846
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:08,193
That's awesome.

3847
02:00:08,410 --> 02:00:08,860
Uh,

3848
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:11,290
Justin wren fight for the forgotten
you're getting all this money,

3849
02:00:11,291 --> 02:00:12,124
dude.

3850
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:14,270
Justin wren up our power
that's in the Congo.

3851
02:00:14,330 --> 02:00:14,620
Oh,

3852
02:00:14,620 --> 02:00:15,380
I'll send it.

3853
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:16,160
That's great.

3854
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:16,940
Exactly.

3855
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:17,151
Yeah.

3856
02:00:17,151 --> 02:00:17,421
He,

3857
02:00:17,421 --> 02:00:18,230
um,

3858
02:00:18,230 --> 02:00:23,230
he's a great guy who's living in the
Congo right now and he builds wells for

3859
02:00:23,901 --> 02:00:24,740
these pygmies.

3860
02:00:24,741 --> 02:00:25,910
It gets the medicine.

3861
02:00:26,090 --> 02:00:27,470
This poor guy has gotten,

3862
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:30,020
he's gotten horrible diseases.

3863
02:00:30,021 --> 02:00:30,171
Why?

3864
02:00:30,171 --> 02:00:30,741
He's been down there.

3865
02:00:30,741 --> 02:00:32,180
He had dang gay fever.

3866
02:00:32,181 --> 02:00:33,620
You almost fucking died.

3867
02:00:34,130 --> 02:00:34,611
And uh,

3868
02:00:34,611 --> 02:00:36,140
he is dedicating his,

3869
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:38,780
his entire life to do this.

3870
02:00:38,781 --> 02:00:40,040
So I will,

3871
02:00:40,041 --> 02:00:40,280
uh,

3872
02:00:40,280 --> 02:00:43,160
I will donate all of
this to my friend Justin,

3873
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:44,470
and it's going to keep coming in.

3874
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:45,513
So,

3875
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:46,811
Holy Shit,

3876
02:00:46,811 --> 02:00:47,090
dude,

3877
02:00:47,090 --> 02:00:48,080
that's nuts.

3878
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:49,210
It okay.

3879
02:00:49,211 --> 02:00:50,380
So the,

3880
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:52,210
this is pure madness.

3881
02:00:52,211 --> 02:00:53,044
When I feel my phone,

3882
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:54,753
can I sit on it?

3883
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:56,620
Put it up your ass.

3884
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:57,891
I have a hunger yet.

3885
02:00:57,891 --> 02:00:59,140
So coming in,

3886
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:03,760
this is ridiculous as a big community
out there and they're very generous.

3887
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:04,401
Yeah.

3888
02:01:04,401 --> 02:01:06,140
No they most certainly are.

3889
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:07,760
I'm not kidding ladies and gentlemen.

3890
02:01:07,761 --> 02:01:10,400
I got about a hundred
donations in the past minute.

3891
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:11,120
Wow.

3892
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:12,620
And you did phone to keep up.

3893
02:01:12,810 --> 02:01:14,790
You didn't need to make any
arrangements with these people.

3894
02:01:14,791 --> 02:01:17,180
They didn't eat and there
was no banks and fall off.

3895
02:01:17,190 --> 02:01:18,270
There was nothing.

3896
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:20,280
It was just direct from them to you.

3897
02:01:20,281 --> 02:01:20,641
Boom.

3898
02:01:20,641 --> 02:01:22,920
Charity happening in real time.

3899
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:23,401
Yeah.

3900
02:01:23,401 --> 02:01:24,360
This is crazy.

3901
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:25,410
Okay,

3902
02:01:25,410 --> 02:01:26,243
that's cool.

3903
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:27,713
Yeah.

3904
02:01:27,770 --> 02:01:29,300
This is madness man.

3905
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:32,220
Some people are donating real money too.

3906
02:01:33,530 --> 02:01:35,420
You can't steal my bitcoin dude.

3907
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:36,680
Are you a hacker?

3908
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:37,060
I've,

3909
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:37,893
I've received,

3910
02:01:38,270 --> 02:01:39,860
I've received that.

3911
02:01:39,890 --> 02:01:40,550
Um,

3912
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:45,020
in some cases exceeded $3,000 in a single
donation for chart for a charitable

3913
02:01:45,021 --> 02:01:45,620
cause.

3914
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:46,670
That's incredible.

3915
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:47,150
Wow.

3916
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:47,601
Okay.

3917
02:01:47,601 --> 02:01:49,820
They're people are
sending me like 20 bucks.

3918
02:01:50,730 --> 02:01:51,563
It's crazy.

3919
02:01:51,970 --> 02:01:52,340
Yeah.

3920
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:53,840
Like there's a lot of them man.

3921
02:01:54,190 --> 02:01:55,850
And not like a few,

3922
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:58,340
like a lot of them that are like 20 bucks.

3923
02:01:58,341 --> 02:02:02,000
Cause it tells you what it is
approximately by today's standard.

3924
02:02:02,001 --> 02:02:02,271
When it,

3925
02:02:02,271 --> 02:02:03,104
when it pops up.

3926
02:02:03,530 --> 02:02:04,341
This is nuts,

3927
02:02:04,341 --> 02:02:04,491
man.

3928
02:02:04,491 --> 02:02:04,821
I met her,

3929
02:02:04,821 --> 02:02:06,050
shut my fucking phone off.

3930
02:02:06,051 --> 02:02:07,190
I'm going to run out of battery.

3931
02:02:07,191 --> 02:02:08,120
Just close the program

3932
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:10,341
on a Samsung.

3933
02:02:10,341 --> 02:02:11,360
You have to hold it down.

3934
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:12,320
I turned it to like,

3935
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:14,353
how dare you.

3936
02:02:15,190 --> 02:02:17,010
Don't fucking shut up dude.

3937
02:02:17,630 --> 02:02:18,620
You don't know shit.

3938
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:19,431
Fuck.

3939
02:02:19,431 --> 02:02:20,510
And you're an apple fan boy.

3940
02:02:20,511 --> 02:02:24,070
You knew that about that blow
your fucking apple family.

3941
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:25,880
Do you mind by just going there?

3942
02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:26,600
Ah,

3943
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:27,433
fuck you.

3944
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:28,701
Well I can.

3945
02:02:28,701 --> 02:02:28,941
No,

3946
02:02:28,941 --> 02:02:29,780
you task manager,

3947
02:02:29,781 --> 02:02:30,740
you just press close all.

3948
02:02:30,741 --> 02:02:32,420
You don't even have that
option on the iPhone.

3949
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:34,220
Suck upon it.

3950
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:36,440
You don't even have a task manager bitch.

3951
02:02:36,540 --> 02:02:37,910
So you can't just shut them all off.

3952
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:39,530
What's that noise?

3953
02:02:39,530 --> 02:02:39,681
Yeah.

3954
02:02:39,681 --> 02:02:40,550
Somebody hacked your shit.

3955
02:02:40,551 --> 02:02:41,810
They started playing game music.

3956
02:02:42,410 --> 02:02:43,243
What's that?

3957
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:44,241
BITCOIN's face.

3958
02:02:44,241 --> 02:02:45,200
The cover of Newsweek.

3959
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:48,250
So this is a story that
Newsweek broke about.

3960
02:02:48,251 --> 02:02:49,084
That guy.

3961
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:49,950
That guy.

3962
02:02:49,950 --> 02:02:50,500
Uh,

3963
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:51,400
I'll say Angeles.

3964
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:52,450
Um,

3965
02:02:52,450 --> 02:02:53,710
and here's the funny story.

3966
02:02:53,711 --> 02:02:56,250
So his name is Satoshi Nakamoto.

3967
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:57,070
Actually,

3968
02:02:57,070 --> 02:02:59,980
it's a Dorian Percival Satoshi Nakamoto.

3969
02:02:59,981 --> 02:03:03,010
He doesn't go by Satoshi
goes by Dorian and he's nuts.

3970
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,270
He's not the creator of Bitcoin.

3971
02:03:04,271 --> 02:03:07,480
There's no doubt in anyone's
mind at this point and was awake,

3972
02:03:07,510 --> 02:03:12,370
fucked up big time and they
got it wrong and worse.

3973
02:03:12,490 --> 02:03:13,330
They doxed him,

3974
02:03:13,390 --> 02:03:14,470
as we say on the Internet,

3975
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:19,450
they produce pictures of his home
address and his car registration plate.

3976
02:03:19,690 --> 02:03:21,750
And so he got swamped and
not just by journalists,

3977
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:23,950
he got swamped by crazies,

3978
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:28,630
by a really crazy dangerous people who
suddenly thought he was a rich person and

3979
02:03:28,631 --> 02:03:30,100
wanted a piece of the action.

3980
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:31,533
Um,

3981
02:03:32,170 --> 02:03:33,970
it was a really horrible thing to do.

3982
02:03:34,090 --> 02:03:35,740
Very responsible journalism.

3983
02:03:35,741 --> 02:03:39,010
And I'm a very big supporter of
free speech and I thank him as well.

3984
02:03:39,010 --> 02:03:42,460
But if Newsweek does responsible
about that kind of thing,

3985
02:03:42,490 --> 02:03:42,790
right?

3986
02:03:42,790 --> 02:03:45,220
If News Week does crappy journalism,

3987
02:03:45,221 --> 02:03:46,600
they have every right to do that.

3988
02:03:46,660 --> 02:03:51,020
And we have every right to call it
crappy journalism's not crappy journals.

3989
02:03:51,030 --> 02:03:52,240
I'm that guy deserves a sue.

3990
02:03:52,241 --> 02:03:54,400
The fucking shit out of them will work.

3991
02:03:54,580 --> 02:03:55,331
Not Work.

3992
02:03:55,331 --> 02:03:56,230
Not In this country,

3993
02:03:56,231 --> 02:03:57,190
not in California.

3994
02:03:57,191 --> 02:03:58,024
You why not?

3995
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:00,970
First Amendment is very powerful,

3996
02:04:00,971 --> 02:04:03,340
but there's you out at a guy.

3997
02:04:03,341 --> 02:04:05,860
He gave his home address
out and you were wrong.

3998
02:04:06,070 --> 02:04:08,350
I feel like for sure he
should be able to sue.

3999
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:09,340
You don't think he would.

4000
02:04:09,340 --> 02:04:13,030
I think it won't be effective
is especially because the
California has the anti

4001
02:04:13,031 --> 02:04:18,031
slap statutes against strategic lawsuits
for against public participation.

4002
02:04:18,570 --> 02:04:21,330
It's really strong protections
for the first amendment,

4003
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:22,810
especially with journalistic organization.

4004
02:04:22,811 --> 02:04:23,770
You have to show malice.

4005
02:04:23,771 --> 02:04:25,690
You have to show that he's
not in the public interest.

4006
02:04:25,690 --> 02:04:29,500
You have to show deliberate
harm and he has to show damages.

4007
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:30,580
It wouldn't work.

4008
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:31,360
Here's the point.

4009
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:32,440
Here's the important point.

4010
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:34,690
What did the Bitcoin
community do with that?

4011
02:04:35,590 --> 02:04:36,610
They immediately said,

4012
02:04:36,611 --> 02:04:39,090
how can we help this man?

4013
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:39,901
People said,

4014
02:04:39,901 --> 02:04:41,040
let's buy a model trains.

4015
02:04:41,041 --> 02:04:42,330
He really likes model trains.

4016
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:43,470
Let's send them cash.

4017
02:04:43,650 --> 02:04:44,610
And some people started saying,

4018
02:04:44,611 --> 02:04:45,450
let's do a fundraiser.

4019
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:46,320
Let's do a fundraiser.

4020
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:47,250
Let's do a fundraiser.

4021
02:04:47,430 --> 02:04:49,740
But who's going to do
the fundraiser needs?

4022
02:04:49,741 --> 02:04:51,180
Someone trusted in the community.

4023
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:52,500
And I looked at this and I thought,

4024
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:53,790
I really don't want to get involved,

4025
02:04:53,791 --> 02:04:56,220
but this guy really deserves a break.

4026
02:04:56,250 --> 02:04:57,540
So I started a fundraiser.

4027
02:04:57,570 --> 02:04:59,640
Two days after this story broke,

4028
02:05:00,030 --> 02:05:03,030
I created an address which
started with one Dorian,

4029
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:04,920
a bit coin address of Vanity address.

4030
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:05,491
And I said,

4031
02:05:05,491 --> 02:05:06,900
let's do a fundraiser for Dorian.

4032
02:05:07,230 --> 02:05:08,310
And it's six hours.

4033
02:05:08,311 --> 02:05:13,311
That morning we raised 30 bitcoin and
seen thousand dollars and over and over a

4034
02:05:14,881 --> 02:05:19,110
period of one month we
raised a 50 bitcoin 47.

4035
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:20,910
Some are for Dorian.

4036
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:22,260
Um,

4037
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:23,280
that's incredible.

4038
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:28,670
He could have now and it really started
pouring in like exactly what you saw

4039
02:05:28,891 --> 02:05:29,990
just now on air.

4040
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:30,511
What is it?

4041
02:05:30,511 --> 02:05:31,344
What's the address?

4042
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:32,521
Okay,

4043
02:05:32,521 --> 02:05:32,791
yeah,

4044
02:05:32,791 --> 02:05:33,240
let's uh,

4045
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:34,280
let's post it on air.

4046
02:05:34,290 --> 02:05:34,560
He,

4047
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:36,270
I'm sure he would like some more.

4048
02:05:36,390 --> 02:05:37,223
Um,

4049
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:39,000
as I got the video pulled up,

4050
02:05:39,001 --> 02:05:41,400
if you wanted to watch play the video,

4051
02:05:41,430 --> 02:05:42,210
so let me just,

4052
02:05:42,210 --> 02:05:43,950
let me just say what we did next,

4053
02:05:43,951 --> 02:05:44,700
which is,

4054
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:45,533
um,

4055
02:05:46,170 --> 02:05:48,570
we need to make sure we got
this money to the right person.

4056
02:05:48,660 --> 02:05:51,270
And I couldn't do that because a lot
of people came to me and they said,

4057
02:05:51,300 --> 02:05:52,560
I'm Dorian giving the money.

4058
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:53,401
No,

4059
02:05:53,401 --> 02:05:54,234
you're not.

4060
02:05:54,860 --> 02:05:55,800
Not that stupid.

4061
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:58,110
The only thing I knew
is what he looked like.

4062
02:05:58,111 --> 02:06:03,111
So I visited him at his home yesterday
and completed my part of the deal and

4063
02:06:03,571 --> 02:06:05,550
gave him the fund raiser.

4064
02:06:05,551 --> 02:06:06,420
And I haven't announced this.

4065
02:06:06,421 --> 02:06:06,631
Yes,

4066
02:06:06,631 --> 02:06:09,930
I just did a posting with the video
and he made a little video for us.

4067
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:13,230
So I'd like to play that video
is for the bitcoin community.

4068
02:06:13,580 --> 02:06:14,251
And while you're doing that,

4069
02:06:14,251 --> 02:06:15,051
I'll pull up his address.

4070
02:06:15,051 --> 02:06:16,250
You can do some more donations.

4071
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:17,423
Beautiful.

4072
02:06:19,670 --> 02:06:21,570
Or we can do as many as you
want to tell that it about

4073
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:23,440
it hasn't been edited yet.

4074
02:06:23,441 --> 02:06:24,280
It's still in process.

4075
02:06:24,281 --> 02:06:25,114
The editing

4076
02:06:26,330 --> 02:06:27,440
bitcoin community.

4077
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:33,790
Thank you very much for your support
throughout this whole deal that I'm still

4078
02:06:34,101 --> 02:06:34,934
fighting.

4079
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:36,920
And um,

4080
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:41,570
I would like you to see this,

4081
02:06:42,530 --> 02:06:43,490
this magazine,

4082
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:46,400
which came out in April,

4083
02:06:47,810 --> 02:06:49,070
it will be a no,

4084
02:06:49,071 --> 02:06:52,340
actually march 14 issue this year.

4085
02:06:53,240 --> 02:06:54,470
The bitcoin fates,

4086
02:06:54,471 --> 02:06:57,620
the mystery man behind
equipped all currency.

4087
02:06:58,730 --> 02:07:03,730
And I'm not Satoshi Nakamoto
as portrayed as a creator.

4088
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:08,540
My name is Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto.

4089
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:13,370
And of course if I was a real creator,

4090
02:07:13,430 --> 02:07:15,860
I will never use my real name.

4091
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:18,020
So from that point of view,

4092
02:07:18,170 --> 02:07:22,060
I'm sure you guys would know
that's a toy she knocked.

4093
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:23,900
Komodo is not me,

4094
02:07:25,370 --> 02:07:29,240
but a Leah thinks so and use sweets it so,

4095
02:07:29,660 --> 02:07:30,710
but it's not true.

4096
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:32,331
Okay.

4097
02:07:32,331 --> 02:07:37,331
I received the bitcoin
account from Andreas

4098
02:07:40,510 --> 02:07:45,510
and I'm very thankful for
you all these people in us,

4099
02:07:47,170 --> 02:07:52,170
Europe and Asia and Africa and South
America who supported me throughout.

4100
02:07:55,450 --> 02:07:56,680
Thank you very much.

4101
02:07:57,220 --> 02:07:57,970
I want to hug,

4102
02:07:57,970 --> 02:07:58,803
hug you

4103
02:08:00,250 --> 02:08:05,250
2000 or few who donated
and I'm very happy.

4104
02:08:05,711 --> 02:08:08,830
Each one gives me a tech.

4105
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:10,233
He might heart.

4106
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:12,340
Thank you very much.

4107
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:19,020
And I would like to further state
that I'll be one of the big coin user,

4108
02:08:22,990 --> 02:08:27,990
bitcoin community person
who would contribute even if
it's a little part of this

4109
02:08:31,601 --> 02:08:36,601
world for good of humankind as Andrea
[inaudible] and many other few Endover to

4110
02:08:42,701 --> 02:08:46,510
make the world a little
bit better for everybody,

4111
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:48,880
especially for poor people.

4112
02:08:50,110 --> 02:08:50,943
Thank you.

4113
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:55,780
And I'll keep my bitcoin account

4114
02:08:58,180 --> 02:08:58,691
for many,

4115
02:08:58,691 --> 02:09:02,230
many years and hopefully

4116
02:09:04,030 --> 02:09:07,090
I can also contribute as you that to me.

4117
02:09:07,810 --> 02:09:08,470
Thank you.

4118
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:09,430
That's so cool.

4119
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:11,020
That's so cool.

4120
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:11,740
I love,

4121
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:13,060
I love his sentiment.

4122
02:09:13,061 --> 02:09:14,440
I love what he just said.

4123
02:09:14,470 --> 02:09:15,130
You know,

4124
02:09:15,130 --> 02:09:16,270
you could tell that's not a,

4125
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:19,510
I wasn't a canned speech that
that guy was really touched.

4126
02:09:19,690 --> 02:09:19,961
Yes,

4127
02:09:19,961 --> 02:09:20,291
it was a,

4128
02:09:20,291 --> 02:09:20,860
it was a,

4129
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:22,390
he is really sweet,

4130
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:26,320
really sweet person and this
wasn't fair what happened to him,

4131
02:09:26,321 --> 02:09:31,321
but the bitcoin community came through
with a really great fundraiser that will

4132
02:09:32,951 --> 02:09:35,080
have a material impact
on this person's life.

4133
02:09:35,380 --> 02:09:36,213
That's so cool.

4134
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:40,540
And do ops some of the damage that was
caused by irresponsible journalism.

4135
02:09:40,570 --> 02:09:40,801
And I,

4136
02:09:40,801 --> 02:09:41,201
I can tell you,

4137
02:09:41,201 --> 02:09:42,280
I mean I spend three hours with him.

4138
02:09:42,281 --> 02:09:44,480
He is not the tuition to come
out of the creative bitcoin.

4139
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:45,430
No question about it.

4140
02:09:45,431 --> 02:09:45,640
I mean,

4141
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:48,130
just setting up his Internet
connection was a huge struggle.

4142
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:49,810
Is that his a bitcoin address,

4143
02:09:49,811 --> 02:09:50,111
Brian?

4144
02:09:50,111 --> 02:09:50,800
Yeah.

4145
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:51,190
Um,

4146
02:09:51,190 --> 02:09:55,210
can you text me that so I could put it
online or email me that so I to put it

4147
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:55,690
online,

4148
02:09:55,690 --> 02:09:57,880
I female both sent it to me.

4149
02:09:58,210 --> 02:09:58,890
Nope,

4150
02:09:58,890 --> 02:10:01,660
please send it to me and I'll throw
it up on Twitter right now too.

4151
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:02,913
Um,

4152
02:10:03,250 --> 02:10:07,960
with the story explaining to everybody
who this gentleman is and what went

4153
02:10:07,961 --> 02:10:08,794
wrong,

4154
02:10:10,570 --> 02:10:15,360
that's sad that they decided to go
ahead and print that story with no,

4155
02:10:17,030 --> 02:10:18,630
no substantiation.

4156
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:20,590
They're still sticking by the story.

4157
02:10:20,591 --> 02:10:22,930
They still saying we got the right person.

4158
02:10:22,990 --> 02:10:24,070
How can they do that?

4159
02:10:24,071 --> 02:10:24,301
And,

4160
02:10:24,301 --> 02:10:27,970
and it's so obvious to everyone
who's got half a brain,

4161
02:10:28,150 --> 02:10:29,110
what does this gentleman do?

4162
02:10:29,980 --> 02:10:30,731
He's retired.

4163
02:10:30,731 --> 02:10:32,260
He used to be involved in,

4164
02:10:32,530 --> 02:10:32,800
I mean,

4165
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:33,633
I don't want to,

4166
02:10:33,650 --> 02:10:34,040
I don't want

4167
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,430
to intrude in his life any,

4168
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:36,020
any further.

4169
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:37,700
He just wants to be left alone.

4170
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:38,120
Uh,

4171
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:38,871
and by the way,

4172
02:10:38,871 --> 02:10:41,450
he now has access to this
fundraiser so he can,

4173
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:42,440
he can use this money.

4174
02:10:43,070 --> 02:10:44,060
But um,

4175
02:10:45,110 --> 02:10:45,351
yeah,

4176
02:10:45,351 --> 02:10:45,801
I mean they,

4177
02:10:45,801 --> 02:10:45,981
they,

4178
02:10:45,981 --> 02:10:49,070
they basically intruded into his life
and violated his privacy and most

4179
02:10:49,071 --> 02:10:52,040
importantly handled his personal
information irresponsibly.

4180
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:53,480
Um,

4181
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:54,890
but in the end,

4182
02:10:54,891 --> 02:10:58,640
the bitcoin community came through
with generosity and grace and charity.

4183
02:10:58,680 --> 02:10:59,570
And that's the,

4184
02:10:59,630 --> 02:11:01,950
that's really the big
thing about bitcoin is,

4185
02:11:01,951 --> 02:11:04,010
is so much charity going on in this space.

4186
02:11:04,270 --> 02:11:05,320
I think that's beautiful.

4187
02:11:05,321 --> 02:11:07,840
And it is cool at the bid
corn community came through.

4188
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:12,960
But what drives me crazy is that this
long established journalism outlet would

4189
02:11:15,551 --> 02:11:17,620
be so irresponsible.

4190
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:19,090
Not that long established.

4191
02:11:19,091 --> 02:11:24,091
This is being purchased is the name
has been purchased by new management,

4192
02:11:24,161 --> 02:11:26,560
has nothing to do with
the previous management.

4193
02:11:26,980 --> 02:11:27,191
Oh,

4194
02:11:27,191 --> 02:11:27,731
Newsweek,

4195
02:11:27,731 --> 02:11:28,121
raw.

4196
02:11:28,121 --> 02:11:29,950
This is completely new.

4197
02:11:29,951 --> 02:11:31,960
People running under the same brand.

4198
02:11:32,290 --> 02:11:37,210
When did this and now you know exactly
what kind of quality journalism they put

4199
02:11:37,211 --> 02:11:37,630
out,

4200
02:11:37,630 --> 02:11:39,820
which is yellow trash.

4201
02:11:40,070 --> 02:11:41,240
So they're just trying to make money.

4202
02:11:41,420 --> 02:11:45,170
They're just trying to sell
magazines at whatever cost.

4203
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,670
Do you think they knew that this guy,

4204
02:11:46,671 --> 02:11:49,190
do you think they are sticking by
the story because he can't prove it?

4205
02:11:49,550 --> 02:11:54,260
Do you think they're just trying to not
be responsible for their actions or not

4206
02:11:54,261 --> 02:11:58,360
be financially responsible
for any damages that

4207
02:11:58,390 --> 02:11:59,320
he might've suffered?

4208
02:11:59,830 --> 02:12:01,600
They make money the way they make money,

4209
02:12:01,601 --> 02:12:02,590
they make click see the way,

4210
02:12:02,591 --> 02:12:04,470
the more controversy around it,

4211
02:12:04,980 --> 02:12:06,570
it doesn't really matter at this point.

4212
02:12:06,660 --> 02:12:07,860
That's very disappointing.

4213
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,090
So this is a new thing.

4214
02:12:09,091 --> 02:12:10,290
People that have bought Newsweek,

4215
02:12:10,291 --> 02:12:11,160
this is fairly new.

4216
02:12:11,730 --> 02:12:11,881
Yeah.

4217
02:12:11,881 --> 02:12:14,940
This came out on the 14th of March.

4218
02:12:14,970 --> 02:12:15,431
I mean the,

4219
02:12:15,431 --> 02:12:16,650
the purchase of Newsweek.

4220
02:12:17,190 --> 02:12:17,640
Yes.

4221
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:18,300
This is their,

4222
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:19,740
this is their launch edition.

4223
02:12:20,730 --> 02:12:22,020
This is what they launched with.

4224
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:24,270
This is what they launched with.

4225
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:25,220
You can't,

4226
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:28,630
you can't go backwards on your first
issue of a nuance because that would make

4227
02:12:28,631 --> 02:12:28,720
you,

4228
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:29,130
you're like,

4229
02:12:29,130 --> 02:12:29,551
oh yeah,

4230
02:12:29,551 --> 02:12:30,031
we suck.

4231
02:12:30,031 --> 02:12:30,864
Now.

4232
02:12:31,820 --> 02:12:34,320
Their first edition was
an absolute stinker.

4233
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:34,680
Oh,

4234
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:34,831
what?

4235
02:12:34,831 --> 02:12:35,920
A bunch of Dick bags.

4236
02:12:37,370 --> 02:12:38,203
So

4237
02:12:38,990 --> 02:12:39,351
gross.

4238
02:12:39,351 --> 02:12:40,280
I'll never buy a Newsweek.

4239
02:12:40,281 --> 02:12:41,114
I'll tell you that.

4240
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:43,100
Not you can't do that.

4241
02:12:43,370 --> 02:12:43,791
Can't do.

4242
02:12:43,791 --> 02:12:46,400
You can't push a guy's fucking
home address out there.

4243
02:12:46,401 --> 02:12:51,260
And pictures of them will answer dory
and Yakamoto when his lawyers writes us

4244
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:53,173
what?

4245
02:12:53,180 --> 02:12:54,013
I like that guy.

4246
02:12:54,390 --> 02:12:55,620
Fuck you.

4247
02:12:56,490 --> 02:12:57,390
You gotta know,

4248
02:12:57,391 --> 02:12:57,781
man.

4249
02:12:57,781 --> 02:13:00,510
You've got to really be sure
you can't just accuse a guy,

4250
02:13:00,750 --> 02:13:04,470
especially in the midst of all
this chaos with the Mt Gox collapse

4251
02:13:05,180 --> 02:13:10,180
and the very real physical danger that
is implied by first saying that someone

4252
02:13:11,181 --> 02:13:11,931
has a lot of money,

4253
02:13:11,931 --> 02:13:12,764
which he doesn't.

4254
02:13:13,100 --> 02:13:14,080
And uh,

4255
02:13:14,090 --> 02:13:17,470
inviting all of the crazies to
visit his address by publishing it

4256
02:13:18,810 --> 02:13:19,920
insane amounts of money,

4257
02:13:19,921 --> 02:13:20,221
right?

4258
02:13:20,221 --> 02:13:22,040
Like $9 million or something,

4259
02:13:22,041 --> 02:13:23,460
something fucking crazy like that.

4260
02:13:23,580 --> 02:13:24,840
Not even need billion dollars.

4261
02:13:24,841 --> 02:13:25,674
What was it?

4262
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:26,920
The real subtle,

4263
02:13:26,921 --> 02:13:31,921
she could be a controlling up to $500
million in bitcoin a current price.

4264
02:13:32,751 --> 02:13:33,660
So you can hold it.

4265
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:37,080
You mean he might have that
much a million pick one?

4266
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:38,790
He might have himself.

4267
02:13:38,791 --> 02:13:39,930
He might have a million bitcoin.

4268
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:40,883
Yes.

4269
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:41,851
That's,

4270
02:13:41,851 --> 02:13:44,460
that's the estimate that Satoshi
Nakamoto has a million bitcoin.

4271
02:13:44,490 --> 02:13:44,761
Okay.

4272
02:13:44,761 --> 02:13:45,810
But is he real?

4273
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:47,580
Is there a Satoshi Nakamoto?

4274
02:13:47,610 --> 02:13:48,480
Is there a guy,

4275
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:49,110
let's say,

4276
02:13:49,110 --> 02:13:50,220
let's call Mr x.

4277
02:13:50,340 --> 02:13:51,720
There is a real Mr x.

4278
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:52,021
Well,

4279
02:13:52,021 --> 02:13:52,261
I,

4280
02:13:52,261 --> 02:13:53,430
I'd like to think that,

4281
02:13:53,431 --> 02:13:54,264
um,

4282
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:55,680
um,

4283
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:56,760
well she is real.

4284
02:13:57,600 --> 02:13:58,890
She okay.

4285
02:13:59,000 --> 02:13:59,833
Hey,

4286
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:00,540
why not?

4287
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:00,841
Why not?

4288
02:14:00,841 --> 02:14:01,674
Who knows?

4289
02:14:01,950 --> 02:14:03,090
She has a Ba.

4290
02:14:03,310 --> 02:14:05,820
I usually say she's have
to one of the conferences.

4291
02:14:05,821 --> 02:14:07,470
So make sure you treat
all the ladies right.

4292
02:14:07,471 --> 02:14:08,970
Because one of them might be Sitoshi.

4293
02:14:08,971 --> 02:14:09,804
Could you imagine?

4294
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:10,960
Yeah.

4295
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:13,590
Imagine if Satoshi was just
a really smart who's growing?

4296
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:15,020
I mean the,

4297
02:14:15,020 --> 02:14:15,331
the,

4298
02:14:15,331 --> 02:14:15,511
the,

4299
02:14:15,511 --> 02:14:15,931
you know,

4300
02:14:15,931 --> 02:14:17,370
you can say it's a pseudonym,

4301
02:14:17,371 --> 02:14:18,061
so it could be male,

4302
02:14:18,061 --> 02:14:18,391
female,

4303
02:14:18,391 --> 02:14:18,811
doesn't matter.

4304
02:14:18,811 --> 02:14:20,160
It could be several folks.

4305
02:14:20,161 --> 02:14:20,700
Right.

4306
02:14:20,700 --> 02:14:25,530
And I think the most likely explanation
is that it was a group of researchers,

4307
02:14:25,531 --> 02:14:26,430
but it doesn't matter.

4308
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:27,770
It doesn't matter what it is.

4309
02:14:27,771 --> 02:14:28,700
That group of researchers,

4310
02:14:28,701 --> 02:14:33,170
that group of researchers is in control
of $500 million worth of Bitcoin,

4311
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:36,330
potentially potentially in control
because we don't know what's happened with

4312
02:14:36,331 --> 02:14:36,631
the keys.

4313
02:14:36,631 --> 02:14:38,250
None of it has been moved.

4314
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:39,990
None of it has been touched.

4315
02:14:40,230 --> 02:14:42,330
So it's just sitting there.

4316
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:44,163
It's just sitting there.

4317
02:14:44,730 --> 02:14:45,360
We'll test it.

4318
02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:47,330
We'll be the first car that
you could buy with bitcoin.

4319
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:49,130
I don't know.

4320
02:14:49,130 --> 02:14:50,460
He probably can already.

4321
02:14:50,461 --> 02:14:51,001
I think they,

4322
02:14:51,001 --> 02:14:53,870
there's some dealers are selling
a bunch of cars for bitcoin.

4323
02:14:53,970 --> 02:14:56,430
I wouldn't be surprised that
they're selling cars for bitcoin.

4324
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:58,820
A bunch of lumbar kidneys have
been sold for bitcoin already.

4325
02:14:59,790 --> 02:15:04,790
People are buying apartments and property
and planes and then of course in trade

4326
02:15:06,540 --> 02:15:07,321
it in for money.

4327
02:15:07,321 --> 02:15:10,500
So you can pretty much buy anything
with bitcoins with an exchange.

4328
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:12,000
And Virgin Galactic,

4329
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:12,721
um,

4330
02:15:12,721 --> 02:15:13,500
cells,

4331
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:13,830
uh,

4332
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:18,830
seats on their flights to space of a
bitcoin and they've sold seven already.

4333
02:15:20,370 --> 02:15:21,001
All it's happening.

4334
02:15:21,001 --> 02:15:23,220
People are going to space with bitcoin

4335
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:25,070
allegedly going to space.

4336
02:15:25,071 --> 02:15:27,470
They might just get launched
on the end of a bomb.

4337
02:15:28,940 --> 02:15:32,440
That motherfucker's going to have to
fly for a long time before daddy goes to

4338
02:15:32,470 --> 02:15:33,303
space.

4339
02:15:34,130 --> 02:15:38,500
I'm so not interested in being an
early adopter of the fucking spaceship.

4340
02:15:38,820 --> 02:15:41,600
I'm not really space either
coins and Neil degrasse Tyson,

4341
02:15:41,601 --> 02:15:42,720
he thinks it's kind of do it.

4342
02:15:43,030 --> 02:15:43,550
Yeah,

4343
02:15:43,550 --> 02:15:47,870
he thinks it's kind of a goof to spend
$100,000 to go like a little higher than

4344
02:15:47,871 --> 02:15:50,330
a plane and look down and
then dropped back down again.

4345
02:15:50,390 --> 02:15:51,740
Well you do go into zero G.

4346
02:15:51,980 --> 02:15:52,550
Yeah,

4347
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:57,550
and so I think it's interesting because
it's that reusable reentry capability,

4348
02:15:57,981 --> 02:16:02,380
which is revolutionary in the way they've
done it is very visionary approach

4349
02:16:02,410 --> 02:16:03,180
real time.

4350
02:16:03,180 --> 02:16:03,481
Well,

4351
02:16:03,481 --> 02:16:04,201
no doubt about it.

4352
02:16:04,201 --> 02:16:05,800
Richard Branson's a bad mother fucker.

4353
02:16:05,850 --> 02:16:06,211
No,

4354
02:16:06,211 --> 02:16:07,200
a no argument there.

4355
02:16:07,470 --> 02:16:10,050
I just think until you can go to the moon,

4356
02:16:10,110 --> 02:16:11,190
you can go fuck yourself.

4357
02:16:11,700 --> 02:16:12,451
That's what I think.

4358
02:16:12,451 --> 02:16:15,180
Or until you can go zoom around a few con,

4359
02:16:15,210 --> 02:16:15,990
you know,

4360
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:17,310
hang out there for a day,

4361
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:18,000
you know,

4362
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:21,750
sit a luxury suite on a top
of the earth and look down.

4363
02:16:21,870 --> 02:16:24,420
You can only go there for like a minute
and then you got to come flying back

4364
02:16:24,421 --> 02:16:24,811
down again.

4365
02:16:24,811 --> 02:16:25,021
Right?

4366
02:16:25,021 --> 02:16:26,220
Isn't that the idea behind that?

4367
02:16:26,390 --> 02:16:27,050
Yeah,

4368
02:16:27,050 --> 02:16:27,661
I would agree.

4369
02:16:27,661 --> 02:16:29,040
The ultimate goal is to the,

4370
02:16:29,530 --> 02:16:29,951
to the moon.

4371
02:16:29,951 --> 02:16:30,784
Alice

4372
02:16:30,850 --> 02:16:31,490
having nice,

4373
02:16:31,490 --> 02:16:32,470
I like hotel.

4374
02:16:32,471 --> 02:16:32,891
They're like,

4375
02:16:32,891 --> 02:16:35,890
I didn't like a really nice hotel
that you can stay out for a weekend.

4376
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:37,271
Some Moon,

4377
02:16:37,271 --> 02:16:38,020
hotel,

4378
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:40,210
g zero g swimming pools,

4379
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:41,230
zero g sex.

4380
02:16:41,800 --> 02:16:42,420
How about that?

4381
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:43,180
Coming here?

4382
02:16:43,180 --> 02:16:43,780
Facials,

4383
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:46,540
zero g squirt.

4384
02:16:46,541 --> 02:16:48,670
She's ducks like she's no matrix.

4385
02:16:51,660 --> 02:16:52,493
You would have a,

4386
02:16:52,810 --> 02:16:53,081
well,

4387
02:16:53,081 --> 02:16:54,430
I guess it would still propel.

4388
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:57,220
It would probably go on for ever and if
you could stick your dick outside of the

4389
02:16:57,221 --> 02:16:58,240
spaceship and just shoot,

4390
02:16:58,241 --> 02:16:59,074
went into space,

4391
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:01,120
it would just take off forever,

4392
02:17:01,430 --> 02:17:02,830
but it'd be frozen instantly.

4393
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:05,650
Girls on a rag and being on your bed.

4394
02:17:05,651 --> 02:17:07,320
It's floating around in
your whole entire room.

4395
02:17:07,350 --> 02:17:09,530
You're not going to discuss
what if she squirts?

4396
02:17:09,640 --> 02:17:10,473
Yeah,

4397
02:17:10,510 --> 02:17:11,343
yeah,

4398
02:17:11,650 --> 02:17:11,801
yeah.

4399
02:17:11,801 --> 02:17:12,720
You don't want to upset.

4400
02:17:14,650 --> 02:17:16,690
This is the Joe Rogan experience podcast.

4401
02:17:16,691 --> 02:17:17,860
That's how we do things over here.

4402
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:18,993
I'm sorry.

4403
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:19,720
I mean a,

4404
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:21,090
we're going to help you promote bitcoin,

4405
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:22,330
but we're not going to change the format.

4406
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:22,950
No,

4407
02:17:22,950 --> 02:17:23,231
no.

4408
02:17:23,231 --> 02:17:24,130
I love loving it.

4409
02:17:24,131 --> 02:17:24,964
No worries.

4410
02:17:26,910 --> 02:17:27,310
Um,

4411
02:17:27,310 --> 02:17:29,350
so Lamborghini doesn't take it.

4412
02:17:29,351 --> 02:17:30,390
It's like a third party thing.

4413
02:17:30,391 --> 02:17:31,224
Is that how you close?

4414
02:17:31,230 --> 02:17:36,230
Who are selling you ships that are
taking that crazy accepting bitcoin?

4415
02:17:36,281 --> 02:17:36,490
Well,

4416
02:17:36,490 --> 02:17:36,880
yeah.

4417
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:37,930
How crazy is the risk?

4418
02:17:37,931 --> 02:17:38,250
Listen,

4419
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:41,450
you'd get a lot of a lot of publicity
and marketing and then you take the big

4420
02:17:41,451 --> 02:17:44,320
coin and you convert it
the same day to us dollar.

4421
02:17:44,321 --> 02:17:46,300
So you don't get any exchange rate risk.

4422
02:17:46,301 --> 02:17:47,740
And what's the difference?

4423
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:48,670
Nothing.

4424
02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:49,390
Good point.

4425
02:17:49,390 --> 02:17:50,320
It's a very good point.

4426
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:52,030
A lot of merchants are doing,

4427
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:53,650
I kind of see it,

4428
02:17:53,651 --> 02:17:54,251
but man,

4429
02:17:54,251 --> 02:17:54,511
you,

4430
02:17:54,511 --> 02:17:55,240
you would,

4431
02:17:55,240 --> 02:17:56,680
I would put a tap on it.

4432
02:17:56,890 --> 02:17:57,161
You know,

4433
02:17:57,161 --> 02:17:58,420
if it was my dealership,

4434
02:17:58,421 --> 02:18:01,190
I'd say we're allowed to sell
one a month with bitcoin.

4435
02:18:01,270 --> 02:18:05,800
Everything else has to be with good
old American dollars back by blood and

4436
02:18:05,801 --> 02:18:06,634
eagles

4437
02:18:09,490 --> 02:18:10,323
fucking,

4438
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:12,340
you can't just bank the
whole thing on these,

4439
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:14,000
these weird digital currencies.

4440
02:18:14,680 --> 02:18:15,310
I bet.

4441
02:18:15,310 --> 02:18:18,430
I'm going to be sending Justin wren
1000 bucks by the end of this day.

4442
02:18:18,610 --> 02:18:18,840
Yeah,

4443
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:20,260
I might be a lot more than that.

4444
02:18:20,650 --> 02:18:21,071
I don't know.

4445
02:18:21,071 --> 02:18:22,180
I'm going to have to decipher it.

4446
02:18:22,181 --> 02:18:23,014
I'm going to need your help.

4447
02:18:23,260 --> 02:18:23,620
Yeah.

4448
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:25,270
After this podcast is over,

4449
02:18:25,271 --> 02:18:27,650
we're going to have to go over how
much I need to write a check for.

4450
02:18:28,390 --> 02:18:28,630
What?

4451
02:18:28,630 --> 02:18:30,310
I'm going to leave the
money in there though.

4452
02:18:30,311 --> 02:18:31,570
So if you keep sending it to him,

4453
02:18:31,571 --> 02:18:31,991
he'll kill,

4454
02:18:31,991 --> 02:18:32,824
keep getting money.

4455
02:18:33,490 --> 02:18:34,323
Um,

4456
02:18:34,510 --> 02:18:38,530
what else has happened in the last
two and a half months besides these?

4457
02:18:38,531 --> 02:18:41,290
A really fantastic innovations that,

4458
02:18:41,291 --> 02:18:41,800
uh,

4459
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:42,910
that you're excited about?

4460
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:43,961
Well,

4461
02:18:43,961 --> 02:18:44,200
there's,

4462
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:45,880
there's the whole environment,

4463
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:48,280
which is weird in terms of media,

4464
02:18:48,281 --> 02:18:49,061
on regulation.

4465
02:18:49,061 --> 02:18:50,440
It's been good news,

4466
02:18:50,441 --> 02:18:50,831
bad news,

4467
02:18:50,831 --> 02:18:51,191
good news,

4468
02:18:51,191 --> 02:18:52,024
bad news,

4469
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:53,160
trying to stay.

4470
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:54,940
You were talking about
China's spending it,

4471
02:18:54,941 --> 02:18:55,541
not bending it.

4472
02:18:55,541 --> 02:18:57,160
Russia's banning it and not battling it.

4473
02:18:57,161 --> 02:18:58,900
Vietnam spending it and not panning it.

4474
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:03,070
And this is really funny because of
course the countries in which these iron

4475
02:19:03,071 --> 02:19:06,940
fist bands are happening at the
countries where the rule of law is least

4476
02:19:06,941 --> 02:19:07,774
respected.

4477
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:09,281
So true.

4478
02:19:09,281 --> 02:19:09,610
Right,

4479
02:19:09,610 --> 02:19:09,881
right.

4480
02:19:09,881 --> 02:19:11,350
So it's like boots and bandits.

4481
02:19:11,351 --> 02:19:11,740
Well,

4482
02:19:11,740 --> 02:19:12,573
you know what?

4483
02:19:12,730 --> 02:19:15,010
Hard dollars were bands in the 80s,

4484
02:19:15,070 --> 02:19:15,903
in,

4485
02:19:16,240 --> 02:19:16,901
in Russia.

4486
02:19:16,901 --> 02:19:17,520
You couldn't,

4487
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:19,660
you were not allowed to
have foreign currency,

4488
02:19:19,661 --> 02:19:21,430
hard currency throughout the Soviet Union.

4489
02:19:21,780 --> 02:19:22,570
Um,

4490
02:19:22,570 --> 02:19:23,950
it was banned from very,

4491
02:19:23,951 --> 02:19:25,270
very seriously band,

4492
02:19:25,450 --> 02:19:25,721
I guess,

4493
02:19:25,721 --> 02:19:28,280
who started stuffing their
suitcases with hard dollars

4494
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:28,581
first,

4495
02:19:28,581 --> 02:19:29,570
the politburo.

4496
02:19:29,620 --> 02:19:29,721
Oh,

4497
02:19:29,721 --> 02:19:30,080
of course.

4498
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:34,360
And then the army generals and then the
cops and then all of the people who are

4499
02:19:34,361 --> 02:19:35,870
in those countries are above the law.

4500
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:39,320
And then the people who were below the
law then bribes that people who are above

4501
02:19:39,321 --> 02:19:41,000
the law in dollars of course,

4502
02:19:41,390 --> 02:19:41,960
um,

4503
02:19:41,960 --> 02:19:45,050
to also hold dollars and the
whole thing becomes a mockery.

4504
02:19:45,360 --> 02:19:48,600
Puente is like a gigantic
Russian version of John Gotti.

4505
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:50,130
You know,

4506
02:19:50,130 --> 02:19:51,330
he really is like,

4507
02:19:51,331 --> 02:19:52,180
you remember how God,

4508
02:19:52,181 --> 02:19:56,070
he was like so flamboyant about the
fact that he was the head of the mob.

4509
02:19:56,370 --> 02:19:58,700
Like there was the heads
of the mom before God.

4510
02:19:58,701 --> 02:20:00,180
He were like real secretive.

4511
02:20:00,181 --> 02:20:02,160
There was that Guy Vincent the chin,

4512
02:20:02,180 --> 02:20:03,990
good Janti or however you say his name,

4513
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:06,060
who would walk around the
neighborhood pretending to be crazy.

4514
02:20:06,061 --> 02:20:08,570
He would wear a bathrobe
and slippers and you,

4515
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:11,640
they wouldn't even like
say his name because they,

4516
02:20:11,641 --> 02:20:14,850
he told everybody that everything
was being tapped all the time.

4517
02:20:14,970 --> 02:20:17,310
So don't ever say my name
when you're talking about me.

4518
02:20:17,370 --> 02:20:18,510
Point point to your chin.

4519
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:20,790
So people would just like go and you know,

4520
02:20:21,300 --> 02:20:22,860
it's not going to take that he's going to,

4521
02:20:22,861 --> 02:20:23,181
you know,

4522
02:20:23,181 --> 02:20:25,560
it's going to want to do
something for our friends.

4523
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:27,260
So you know,

4524
02:20:27,390 --> 02:20:27,990
that's a good idea.

4525
02:20:27,990 --> 02:20:30,690
They had pointed a Chin because
his name is Vincent the chin,

4526
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:32,970
good Janti or gigante or
whatever the hell it was.

4527
02:20:33,510 --> 02:20:34,170
But um,

4528
02:20:34,170 --> 02:20:34,911
but then God,

4529
02:20:34,911 --> 02:20:39,570
he came along and just wearing
fucking $10,000 suits and you know,

4530
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:44,150
it was an obvious mobster and
had obvious mobsters with a,

4531
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:47,790
when there was public kits and all
this crazy shit and everybody loved him

4532
02:20:47,791 --> 02:20:49,080
because he was the face of the mob.

4533
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:52,080
This Putin guy is sort
of like that in a way.

4534
02:20:52,081 --> 02:20:55,590
But on I'll crazier scale because
he's running a whole country.

4535
02:20:55,890 --> 02:20:59,100
I mean he's essentially just
grabbed the whole country

4536
02:21:00,220 --> 02:21:01,430
and not just that,

4537
02:21:01,610 --> 02:21:03,020
here's the little secret.

4538
02:21:03,021 --> 02:21:08,021
I think that the thing that most people
miss is the elephant in the room.

4539
02:21:08,780 --> 02:21:09,830
And that's Gazprom.

4540
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,350
That's what natural gas,

4541
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:13,700
natural gas Gazprom.

4542
02:21:13,910 --> 02:21:16,910
So basically they've
nationalized the gas industry.

4543
02:21:16,911 --> 02:21:20,450
The gas industry then
supplies a natural gas,

4544
02:21:20,451 --> 02:21:21,284
which is,

4545
02:21:21,550 --> 02:21:21,830
uh,

4546
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:26,510
one of the ways that we've avoided
the impact of peak oil and energy

4547
02:21:26,511 --> 02:21:30,360
constriction that is killing worldwide
economies right now because oil's gotten

4548
02:21:30,410 --> 02:21:31,580
vastly expensive,

4549
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:34,460
but cast Scott cheaper because
of fracking and other things.

4550
02:21:34,461 --> 02:21:36,680
And Gazprom produces most
of the gas in the world.

4551
02:21:36,681 --> 02:21:41,390
So much so that they supply all of Europe
with natural gas and they supply them

4552
02:21:41,391 --> 02:21:46,010
through pipelines that go through which
country Africanize the Ukraine and

4553
02:21:46,011 --> 02:21:47,960
Afghanistan and various other places.

4554
02:21:47,961 --> 02:21:52,961
But the line of pipelines of gas are the
hot spots of war and civil war and the

4555
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:59,570
occupation all across eastern Europe.

4556
02:22:00,260 --> 02:22:03,260
And right now there's this
huge power play going on,

4557
02:22:03,650 --> 02:22:04,040
uh,

4558
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:05,180
around the Ukraine.

4559
02:22:05,450 --> 02:22:10,280
And a lot of that has to
do with a routes of gas.

4560
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:10,941
And it's,

4561
02:22:10,941 --> 02:22:15,941
and it's a massive geopolitical
power play between a world powers.

4562
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:19,820
And Putin can basically say,

4563
02:22:21,020 --> 02:22:23,180
we just doubled the price
of gas in the Ukraine,

4564
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:24,170
which is exactly what they did.

4565
02:22:24,171 --> 02:22:25,770
I think they quadrupled in fact,

4566
02:22:25,771 --> 02:22:29,010
which plunged the
country into a recession.

4567
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:30,240
And then they said to Europe,

4568
02:22:30,241 --> 02:22:30,451
you know,

4569
02:22:30,451 --> 02:22:31,950
you don't threaten us with sanctions,

4570
02:22:31,951 --> 02:22:33,210
we're going to turn off your gas.

4571
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:34,140
And if you do,

4572
02:22:34,440 --> 02:22:37,740
all of you are going into
recession because that's the
only form of cheap energy

4573
02:22:37,741 --> 02:22:38,574
you have.

4574
02:22:39,030 --> 02:22:39,121
Oh,

4575
02:22:39,121 --> 02:22:40,530
we got to go into world war three

4576
02:22:41,150 --> 02:22:43,660
is that it seems like some
weird shit is happening.

4577
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:45,970
Japan is upping its military now.

4578
02:22:45,971 --> 02:22:48,160
It's navy is getting larger
and larger by the day.

4579
02:22:48,490 --> 02:22:49,090
And uh,

4580
02:22:49,090 --> 02:22:49,510
they're,

4581
02:22:49,510 --> 02:22:52,870
they're changing their whole policies
as far as how they deal with other

4582
02:22:52,871 --> 02:22:57,250
countries because China is encroaching
on a lot of these islands that Japan has

4583
02:22:57,251 --> 02:22:58,150
been controlling.

4584
02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:03,720
And it seems to me like more and more
every day the powers are moving into

4585
02:23:03,851 --> 02:23:06,730
position to dominate
portions of the world.

4586
02:23:06,731 --> 02:23:07,564
And it just seems,

4587
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:09,730
it seems like some shit
is about to happen.

4588
02:23:10,270 --> 02:23:15,190
The era of cheap energy is over and the
world has to reshuffle to accept that

4589
02:23:15,191 --> 02:23:16,024
fact.

4590
02:23:16,390 --> 02:23:16,930
Uh,

4591
02:23:16,930 --> 02:23:19,600
cheap peak oil changes everything.

4592
02:23:19,660 --> 02:23:21,220
You can't sustain the same,

4593
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:22,061
uh,

4594
02:23:22,061 --> 02:23:27,061
consumerists behavior in developed
countries and that together with climate

4595
02:23:27,311 --> 02:23:28,060
change,

4596
02:23:28,060 --> 02:23:28,451
it's a,

4597
02:23:28,451 --> 02:23:29,440
it's a combination.

4598
02:23:29,441 --> 02:23:33,940
The creates upheaval all around the
world and at the same time you have the

4599
02:23:33,941 --> 02:23:38,941
world's worst currency crisis in three
generations and we are currently living

4600
02:23:39,551 --> 02:23:44,320
through the most significant currency
crisis with dozens of countries suffering

4601
02:23:44,321 --> 02:23:46,900
from hyperinflation with our
currency is about to collapse,

4602
02:23:47,060 --> 02:23:47,770
um,

4603
02:23:47,770 --> 02:23:49,900
Europe and the euro
hanging from a threads,

4604
02:23:49,901 --> 02:23:54,400
the British sterling hanging from a
thread and the US dollar going crazy with

4605
02:23:54,401 --> 02:23:57,190
printing and into that environment.

4606
02:23:57,730 --> 02:23:58,930
You now have bitcoin.

4607
02:23:58,960 --> 02:24:03,400
It's a really interesting time to live
in because there's so much change going

4608
02:24:03,401 --> 02:24:05,990
on as an escort service accepts bit coin.

4609
02:24:06,620 --> 02:24:07,280
Yes.

4610
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:08,300
He's very excited.

4611
02:24:08,301 --> 02:24:10,910
Now did you put up your bitcoin address?

4612
02:24:11,060 --> 02:24:11,860
Yeah,

4613
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:13,850
you should say that.

4614
02:24:13,940 --> 02:24:15,980
I'll donate it all to Justin ran.

4615
02:24:15,981 --> 02:24:19,100
You'll didn't donate it all to hookers,

4616
02:24:19,490 --> 02:24:22,210
corvette to all Lexis.

4617
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:27,620
So I'm glad that we didn't get very far
with a conversation about empowering the

4618
02:24:27,621 --> 02:24:32,380
poor and discussions about
bitcoin can do before Brian Duff,

4619
02:24:32,890 --> 02:24:33,910
an escort site.

4620
02:24:35,150 --> 02:24:37,490
It's nice to empower the poor.

4621
02:24:37,491 --> 02:24:39,200
But guess who else was poor hookers?

4622
02:24:40,040 --> 02:24:40,873
Yeah.

4623
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:41,750
Um,

4624
02:24:41,750 --> 02:24:41,931
no,

4625
02:24:41,931 --> 02:24:42,764
I see what you're saying.

4626
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:44,993
The best way to do it.

4627
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:48,810
One thing that you can say about
that particular cases that um,

4628
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:53,610
women in those professions
are exploited by,

4629
02:24:53,820 --> 02:24:54,653
by the men.

4630
02:24:55,710 --> 02:24:56,543
You can't do that.

4631
02:24:56,940 --> 02:24:58,770
The kid just sneakily post that,

4632
02:24:58,980 --> 02:24:59,731
put it on your Twitter.

4633
02:24:59,731 --> 02:25:02,130
You fuck put it on your
Twitter and I'll retweet it.

4634
02:25:02,180 --> 02:25:03,013
Okay.

4635
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:06,373
Sorry.

4636
02:25:06,490 --> 02:25:06,760
Yeah,

4637
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:07,161
you're right.

4638
02:25:07,161 --> 02:25:07,990
They're exploited.

4639
02:25:07,990 --> 02:25:08,823
All the money,

4640
02:25:08,930 --> 02:25:12,560
all the money flows to the men
who control and exploit them.

4641
02:25:12,561 --> 02:25:13,130
Right?

4642
02:25:13,130 --> 02:25:17,040
And so bitcoin is being used already in,

4643
02:25:17,150 --> 02:25:22,150
in many cases for women to be able to
keep control of their money so he can't be

4644
02:25:22,461 --> 02:25:24,790
stolen pimps and exploited,

4645
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,350
exploited boyfriends and,

4646
02:25:26,740 --> 02:25:30,880
and a hustler is in all of the other
criminals who are around them who take

4647
02:25:30,881 --> 02:25:31,701
advantage of these women.

4648
02:25:31,701 --> 02:25:35,830
So actually it is quite an empowering
technology even in that particular

4649
02:25:35,860 --> 02:25:38,380
occupation or related occupations.

4650
02:25:38,381 --> 02:25:40,780
I was having this conversation on
Twitter and people with teasing me.

4651
02:25:40,781 --> 02:25:41,614
So I did a,

4652
02:25:41,790 --> 02:25:42,623
uh,

4653
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:43,553
uh,

4654
02:25:44,770 --> 02:25:46,030
a satirical shot.

4655
02:25:46,210 --> 02:25:46,571
I said,

4656
02:25:46,571 --> 02:25:47,020
look,

4657
02:25:47,020 --> 02:25:48,160
I'm going to start at the same business.

4658
02:25:48,161 --> 02:25:53,161
I'm going to post the a half naked shot
of me and I'm going to make people pay

4659
02:25:54,161 --> 02:25:59,161
me to stop because I'm a pasty middle
aged male and nobody wants to see that

4660
02:25:59,441 --> 02:26:03,720
shit and I'm going to donate all of the
money that I raised and now it's it.

4661
02:26:03,730 --> 02:26:04,900
It went viral on Twitter.

4662
02:26:04,901 --> 02:26:08,340
It's me doing a Miley Cyrus
impersonation of looking at hammer.

4663
02:26:08,510 --> 02:26:09,970
It's just like from hero,

4664
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:14,050
but it's a smart move.

4665
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:15,490
But I raised and,

4666
02:26:15,491 --> 02:26:19,750
and I'm pretty proud of that photo because
I ridiculed and exploited myself and

4667
02:26:19,751 --> 02:26:20,770
raise $600,

4668
02:26:20,771 --> 02:26:24,250
which I donated to the rape
and incest national network,

4669
02:26:24,251 --> 02:26:26,410
which is a network that
helps exploited women,

4670
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:27,130
uh,

4671
02:26:27,130 --> 02:26:30,370
extract themselves from the abusive
environments and gives them shelter.

4672
02:26:30,510 --> 02:26:34,750
And essentially it's like a underground
railroad to get them away from people

4673
02:26:34,751 --> 02:26:38,290
who are exploiting them
or abusing them badly.

4674
02:26:38,470 --> 02:26:39,161
That's awesome.

4675
02:26:39,161 --> 02:26:39,431
You know,

4676
02:26:39,431 --> 02:26:42,430
one of the things that we've talked
about on this podcast before and I think

4677
02:26:42,431 --> 02:26:44,140
applies here is that there's,

4678
02:26:44,290 --> 02:26:49,290
there's a certain morality to a lot of
these big tech companies and to tech in

4679
02:26:49,781 --> 02:26:53,970
general that I don't think exists in a
lot of other industries and that there's

4680
02:26:53,980 --> 02:26:55,690
a lot of companies that are coming up now.

4681
02:26:55,691 --> 02:26:58,780
Tech companies that are
founded by very intelligent,

4682
02:26:58,781 --> 02:27:03,781
very educated people also have pretty
strong ethics and I think that's rare for,

4683
02:27:04,410 --> 02:27:06,960
for businesses to have like a,

4684
02:27:06,980 --> 02:27:11,680
like a fairly established trend of
ethical consideration involved in their

4685
02:27:11,681 --> 02:27:12,610
business practices.

4686
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:16,720
And one of the reasons why I think is
because no one understands transparency

4687
02:27:16,721 --> 02:27:18,460
more than people that are
really into the Internet.

4688
02:27:18,940 --> 02:27:23,740
No one understands the implications or
the ramifications rather of your actions,

4689
02:27:23,980 --> 02:27:26,590
whether positive or negative
more than people that are,

4690
02:27:27,100 --> 02:27:28,000
that are on the Internet.

4691
02:27:28,390 --> 02:27:29,223
What are you looking up at you?

4692
02:27:29,490 --> 02:27:30,530
I'm waiting for red vans.

4693
02:27:30,531 --> 02:27:33,020
Pull up some embarrassing
photos and moment to do that.

4694
02:27:33,400 --> 02:27:36,390
You have that same
photos then will the fe,

4695
02:27:36,410 --> 02:27:37,700
the picture that he was talking about?

4696
02:27:37,730 --> 02:27:38,081
Oh No,

4697
02:27:38,081 --> 02:27:38,231
no,

4698
02:27:38,231 --> 02:27:38,361
no.

4699
02:27:38,361 --> 02:27:38,721
Don't,

4700
02:27:38,721 --> 02:27:39,260
don't.

4701
02:27:39,260 --> 02:27:39,531
No,

4702
02:27:39,531 --> 02:27:40,364
I'll think.

4703
02:27:40,710 --> 02:27:43,130
See he's being really nice to me today.

4704
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:43,810
Thank you.

4705
02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:44,990
It was nice to see buddy.

4706
02:27:44,991 --> 02:27:45,824
He's always nice.

4707
02:27:45,890 --> 02:27:46,460
Believe me,

4708
02:27:46,460 --> 02:27:47,330
I did read though,

4709
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:50,570
I was doing some research about the Ip
of thing cause that's the only thing I

4710
02:27:50,571 --> 02:27:51,051
did have.

4711
02:27:51,051 --> 02:27:54,920
But there is some people saying that you
could find the Ip if you were devoted

4712
02:27:54,921 --> 02:27:55,370
to it.

4713
02:27:55,370 --> 02:27:58,580
Like meaning if I really wanted to find
out what your IPO address it's using the

4714
02:27:58,581 --> 02:27:59,660
bitcoin currency,

4715
02:27:59,661 --> 02:28:03,530
I could just probably figure it out
if I was really detailed about it.

4716
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:05,030
No you can't.

4717
02:28:05,110 --> 02:28:05,510
Um,

4718
02:28:05,510 --> 02:28:08,930
I think that's entirely wrong because um,

4719
02:28:09,860 --> 02:28:11,690
if you were doing transactions,

4720
02:28:12,050 --> 02:28:16,610
those transactions would be communicated
across the peer to peer network,

4721
02:28:16,611 --> 02:28:20,030
kind of like bittorrent and they spread
through that peer to peer network in

4722
02:28:20,031 --> 02:28:22,310
such a way that you can't even
with the transaction happened.

4723
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:25,400
But in your particular case you're
not even doing any transactions.

4724
02:28:25,810 --> 02:28:26,643
Um,

4725
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:31,660
there is no way to associate a bit coin
address to an Ip address unless you're

4726
02:28:31,791 --> 02:28:34,350
monitoring that person
specific communication.

4727
02:28:34,351 --> 02:28:35,184
So for example,

4728
02:28:35,360 --> 02:28:37,160
if someone's monitoring your laptop,

4729
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:39,350
they can figure out your
connected to that Ip address.

4730
02:28:39,351 --> 02:28:40,190
But guess what?

4731
02:28:40,220 --> 02:28:41,420
If they're monitoring your laptop,

4732
02:28:41,421 --> 02:28:43,310
they already know that it's not so hard.

4733
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:46,280
But just monitoring the bitcoin network,

4734
02:28:46,281 --> 02:28:50,390
you cannot associate addresses to
bitcoin addresses to Ip addresses.

4735
02:28:50,660 --> 02:28:52,750
I'm putting up Dorian Nakamoto goes,

4736
02:28:52,751 --> 02:28:52,890
I,

4737
02:28:52,890 --> 02:28:54,140
I retweeted yours,

4738
02:28:54,141 --> 02:28:55,370
Brian and,

4739
02:28:55,371 --> 02:28:56,000
uh,

4740
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,550
contribute to Dorian Nakamoto

4741
02:29:00,230 --> 02:29:00,750
too.

4742
02:29:00,750 --> 02:29:02,270
How do you spell Dorian?

4743
02:29:02,271 --> 02:29:02,691
Dorian?

4744
02:29:02,691 --> 02:29:02,841
T.

4745
02:29:02,841 --> 02:29:05,660
O r I a n and knock a moto.

4746
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:05,991
Yes,

4747
02:29:05,991 --> 02:29:06,411
exactly.

4748
02:29:06,411 --> 02:29:07,250
How you see you hear it.

4749
02:29:07,310 --> 02:29:12,310
Do you know who damn Kaminsky is a chief
scientist for d k h he wrote in 2011

4750
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:16,093
that you could,

4751
02:29:16,330 --> 02:29:17,163
uh,

4752
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:19,100
do that.

4753
02:29:19,310 --> 02:29:20,210
And that's what I

4754
02:29:21,710 --> 02:29:24,200
was basing my findings on.

4755
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:27,980
He said that unless you're a very careful
in the way you use bitcoin and you

4756
02:29:27,981 --> 02:29:32,240
have the technical know how to use it
with other anonymizing to technologies

4757
02:29:32,241 --> 02:29:33,860
like tour or ITP,

4758
02:29:34,370 --> 02:29:37,850
you should assume that a
persistent motivated attacker
will be able to associate

4759
02:29:37,851 --> 02:29:40,520
your IP address with
your bitcoin transactions

4760
02:29:42,470 --> 02:29:47,470
and Black Hawk black hat 2011 talk.

4761
02:29:48,140 --> 02:29:48,500
Yeah.

4762
02:29:48,500 --> 02:29:48,731
And the,

4763
02:29:48,731 --> 02:29:49,700
and that's not their,

4764
02:29:49,730 --> 02:29:52,400
they're not associating the Ip address,

4765
02:29:52,401 --> 02:29:54,350
the bitcoin address because
it's in the network.

4766
02:29:54,360 --> 02:29:59,360
While we're talking about there is a
determined attacker who's conducting

4767
02:29:59,991 --> 02:30:04,010
surveillance of the entire network and
has the resources to track down what's

4768
02:30:04,011 --> 02:30:04,640
happening.

4769
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:07,280
And so people say that
bitcoin is anonymous,

4770
02:30:07,281 --> 02:30:08,420
but in fact it's not.

4771
02:30:08,450 --> 02:30:10,860
It's pseudonymous and loosely synonymous.

4772
02:30:10,880 --> 02:30:15,880
That means that if you conduct activities
with Bitcoin that associate your

4773
02:30:16,580 --> 02:30:18,680
bitcoin address to other things,

4774
02:30:18,681 --> 02:30:19,610
like for example,

4775
02:30:19,940 --> 02:30:24,080
you use it to buy something
and then that's something
gets shipped to your home.

4776
02:30:24,260 --> 02:30:27,980
Well now you tied that bitcoin
address to your physical address,

4777
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:29,360
right?

4778
02:30:29,360 --> 02:30:30,680
Or um,

4779
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:33,890
I have a donation address that I publish.

4780
02:30:33,950 --> 02:30:35,570
Everybody knows that's my address.

4781
02:30:35,571 --> 02:30:37,790
Now if I take money from
that bit coin address,

4782
02:30:37,791 --> 02:30:42,320
which my donation address and I move it
into my wallets that I use to spend on

4783
02:30:42,321 --> 02:30:42,861
other things.

4784
02:30:42,861 --> 02:30:44,990
Now everyone can track that step by step.

4785
02:30:44,991 --> 02:30:45,171
No,

4786
02:30:45,171 --> 02:30:48,860
well that's my wallet and then track
everything that goes out of that wallet.

4787
02:30:49,640 --> 02:30:54,640
So I have to take some basic privacy
precautions to protect against that.

4788
02:30:55,220 --> 02:30:57,590
Now would there be cause like it's
kind of like an account number,

4789
02:30:57,591 --> 02:30:58,580
I guess like at a bank,

4790
02:30:58,581 --> 02:30:59,414
like you said.

4791
02:30:59,510 --> 02:30:59,751
Now,

4792
02:30:59,751 --> 02:31:03,470
is there technology or is or
hackers that can take knowing your,

4793
02:31:03,471 --> 02:31:08,471
your account number and recreate it in a
program that makes it seem like you are

4794
02:31:09,411 --> 02:31:11,240
that person and uh,

4795
02:31:11,380 --> 02:31:13,430
like transfer money out of that account?

4796
02:31:13,610 --> 02:31:13,881
No,

4797
02:31:13,881 --> 02:31:14,391
because the,

4798
02:31:14,391 --> 02:31:18,890
the address itself is essentially
one part of an encryption key.

4799
02:31:19,410 --> 02:31:20,160
And

4800
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,200
the other part of the pair of keys,

4801
02:31:22,260 --> 02:31:25,680
the private key is the thing
you have on your phone wallet,

4802
02:31:26,050 --> 02:31:26,710
right?

4803
02:31:26,710 --> 02:31:27,720
That's the secret.

4804
02:31:28,170 --> 02:31:30,540
That's the thing that allows
you to sign transactions.

4805
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:35,840
And the whole basis of cryptography of
encryption systems is that you can't go

4806
02:31:36,211 --> 02:31:38,550
from the public address
to the private secret.

4807
02:31:39,030 --> 02:31:40,350
You can't go backwards.

4808
02:31:40,650 --> 02:31:42,030
You can go from the private secret,

4809
02:31:42,031 --> 02:31:43,740
you can recreate the public address,

4810
02:31:43,741 --> 02:31:44,790
but you can't go backwards.

4811
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:49,200
That is the whole basis that technology
is the same technology that's used to

4812
02:31:49,201 --> 02:31:50,280
secure a bank networks.

4813
02:31:50,281 --> 02:31:53,790
It's the same technology that's
used to secure Tomahawk missiles.

4814
02:31:53,791 --> 02:31:56,460
It's the same technology that's
used to secure everything.

4815
02:31:57,090 --> 02:31:57,923
And so,

4816
02:31:58,620 --> 02:31:59,250
um,

4817
02:31:59,250 --> 02:32:04,250
you can rest assured that the cryptography
at the core of bitcoin is solid

4818
02:32:05,821 --> 02:32:08,820
because it's used across
all of the other industries.

4819
02:32:09,110 --> 02:32:09,921
Be better off like,

4820
02:32:09,921 --> 02:32:10,091
hey,

4821
02:32:10,091 --> 02:32:13,820
when a charged my phone on your laptop
and then you just download their phone

4822
02:32:13,821 --> 02:32:16,700
and then re upload it on your phone
and then you have their wallet and you

4823
02:32:16,701 --> 02:32:17,534
shave.

4824
02:32:18,410 --> 02:32:21,530
So that's why you have
masterminds blueprint,

4825
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:24,650
so that's why you have a password
on that application so that if he,

4826
02:32:24,651 --> 02:32:25,700
if you steal the data,

4827
02:32:25,701 --> 02:32:26,030
if that up

4828
02:32:26,030 --> 02:32:26,601
application,

4829
02:32:26,601 --> 02:32:27,201
it's encrypted,

4830
02:32:27,201 --> 02:32:29,180
then you can't see the
keys that are underneath.

4831
02:32:29,240 --> 02:32:29,570
Right.

4832
02:32:29,570 --> 02:32:33,590
That's what the pin number and password
do and I have a secondary password.

4833
02:32:33,591 --> 02:32:36,500
Those also prevents from spending
specifically for spending.

4834
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:37,361
All right,

4835
02:32:37,361 --> 02:32:37,541
man,

4836
02:32:37,541 --> 02:32:38,830
you want to do this again in three months?

4837
02:32:39,360 --> 02:32:39,841
I'd love to.

4838
02:32:39,841 --> 02:32:41,630
It's about three years in bitcoin time.

4839
02:32:41,631 --> 02:32:42,960
A lot of things will change.

4840
02:32:43,890 --> 02:32:46,020
Well that really appreciate
every opportunity.

4841
02:32:46,190 --> 02:32:47,210
I appreciate it as well.

4842
02:32:47,211 --> 02:32:48,140
I mean you were very,

4843
02:32:48,141 --> 02:32:51,950
very informative and we've never
be this educated about this stuff.

4844
02:32:51,951 --> 02:32:55,280
If it wasn't for you and I think you'd
do a huge service to not just the tech

4845
02:32:55,281 --> 02:32:56,091
community with this,

4846
02:32:56,091 --> 02:32:58,010
but just the general population,

4847
02:32:58,011 --> 02:32:59,930
giving them an understanding
of what this is all about.

4848
02:32:59,931 --> 02:33:03,020
There's so much misinformation
and confusion about it.

4849
02:33:03,021 --> 02:33:03,231
I mean,

4850
02:33:03,231 --> 02:33:07,190
we had just Brian and I to fucking dunces
sitting there staring at each other,

4851
02:33:07,191 --> 02:33:09,170
trying to figure out what it
was before you came along.

4852
02:33:09,560 --> 02:33:11,240
So it helps us tremendously.

4853
02:33:11,241 --> 02:33:12,051
And I think,

4854
02:33:12,051 --> 02:33:12,321
uh,

4855
02:33:12,321 --> 02:33:13,500
what you're doing is,

4856
02:33:14,040 --> 02:33:14,581
is it's,

4857
02:33:14,581 --> 02:33:15,710
it's brave.

4858
02:33:15,770 --> 02:33:16,041
I mean,

4859
02:33:16,041 --> 02:33:16,181
you,

4860
02:33:16,181 --> 02:33:18,080
you're getting paid through bitcoin.

4861
02:33:18,081 --> 02:33:18,980
It's noble.

4862
02:33:18,981 --> 02:33:19,410
You have,

4863
02:33:19,410 --> 02:33:21,560
you're using it in great ways.

4864
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:23,600
I love what you did for Nakamoto.

4865
02:33:23,601 --> 02:33:24,920
I just posted his,

4866
02:33:24,921 --> 02:33:29,300
a bitcoin address along with an article
explaining what went wrong and how he's

4867
02:33:29,301 --> 02:33:30,170
not that guy.

4868
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:30,891
And,

4869
02:33:30,891 --> 02:33:31,724
um,

4870
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:32,960
I just think it's cool as fuck,

4871
02:33:32,961 --> 02:33:33,410
man.

4872
02:33:33,410 --> 02:33:33,830
And uh,

4873
02:33:33,830 --> 02:33:35,420
I'm honored that you're a part of this.

4874
02:33:35,500 --> 02:33:35,640
Oh,

4875
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:36,411
thank you so much.

4876
02:33:36,411 --> 02:33:36,501
And,

4877
02:33:36,501 --> 02:33:40,370
and what I'm doing is I'm just
expressing my enthusiasm for this space,

4878
02:33:40,371 --> 02:33:44,780
but let me tell you a couple of quick
stories about why this was awesome.

4879
02:33:45,050 --> 02:33:45,620
Uh,

4880
02:33:45,620 --> 02:33:47,530
after the first Joe Rogan experience,

4881
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:48,320
um,

4882
02:33:48,320 --> 02:33:52,850
suddenly I had people everywhere coming
and telling me that they got into

4883
02:33:52,851 --> 02:33:54,410
bitcoin because of that first show,

4884
02:33:54,411 --> 02:33:56,480
because they finally were
able to understand it.

4885
02:33:56,481 --> 02:33:57,500
And I'll give you two stories.

4886
02:33:57,860 --> 02:33:58,641
A month ago,

4887
02:33:58,641 --> 02:33:59,780
I was in a Houston airport.

4888
02:33:59,781 --> 02:34:01,160
I was sitting down having lunch.

4889
02:34:01,161 --> 02:34:04,730
I was in transits between flights and
I'm sitting there and someone sees my

4890
02:34:04,731 --> 02:34:05,381
watch and they go,

4891
02:34:05,381 --> 02:34:05,421
oh,

4892
02:34:05,421 --> 02:34:06,440
is that the new pebble?

4893
02:34:06,470 --> 02:34:06,801
I'm like,

4894
02:34:06,801 --> 02:34:07,131
yeah,

4895
02:34:07,131 --> 02:34:07,461
it is.

4896
02:34:07,461 --> 02:34:10,490
You could write applications and
what kind of applications as well.

4897
02:34:10,520 --> 02:34:11,780
The application I have on here,

4898
02:34:11,781 --> 02:34:15,230
which is pretty cool is I can check
bitcoin addresses and like bitcoin

4899
02:34:15,231 --> 02:34:15,800
addresses.

4900
02:34:15,800 --> 02:34:15,921
Oh,

4901
02:34:15,921 --> 02:34:16,670
that's pretty cool.

4902
02:34:16,670 --> 02:34:17,020
Yeah.

4903
02:34:17,020 --> 02:34:17,291
I said,

4904
02:34:17,291 --> 02:34:17,980
you heard a bitcoin?

4905
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:18,191
Yeah,

4906
02:34:18,191 --> 02:34:19,024
I've heard of bitcoin.

4907
02:34:19,240 --> 02:34:19,451
Hey,

4908
02:34:19,451 --> 02:34:20,440
hang on a second.

4909
02:34:20,770 --> 02:34:23,350
Is Your name and your absence
and all pillows are like,

4910
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:24,333
yeah.

4911
02:34:24,470 --> 02:34:25,720
Were you on Joe Rogan?

4912
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:27,880
You're the reason I bought bitcoin.

4913
02:34:28,090 --> 02:34:32,140
I got involved in bitcoin after seeing
that episodes and I was just blown away.

4914
02:34:32,141 --> 02:34:32,411
I mean,

4915
02:34:32,411 --> 02:34:35,800
this is like I'm sitting down for lunch
and a transit area in a restaurant.

4916
02:34:35,830 --> 02:34:38,110
I'm not used to being recognized that way,

4917
02:34:38,740 --> 02:34:39,970
so the better part.

4918
02:34:40,300 --> 02:34:41,133
Monday,

4919
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:43,810
yesterday I landed at lax.

4920
02:34:44,230 --> 02:34:45,011
I go to enterprise,

4921
02:34:45,011 --> 02:34:46,330
rent a car to pick up my car.

4922
02:34:46,390 --> 02:34:47,350
I get into my car,

4923
02:34:47,380 --> 02:34:48,400
I drive to the exit.

4924
02:34:48,520 --> 02:34:53,520
I had my driver's license
and rental tickets to the
booth guy at the exit and he

4925
02:34:53,771 --> 02:34:55,150
takes a look at it and he goes,

4926
02:34:56,140 --> 02:34:57,580
were you in the Joe Rogan experience?

4927
02:34:58,870 --> 02:34:59,620
Like yeah,

4928
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:01,000
you're the reason I bought bitcoin.

4929
02:35:01,030 --> 02:35:04,690
You're the reason I got into bitcoin
and I follow you on Twitter in the Joe

4930
02:35:04,690 --> 02:35:06,130
Rogan experience got me into bitcoin.

4931
02:35:06,340 --> 02:35:11,340
This story has repeated a thousand times
for me and not just from 15,000 people

4932
02:35:12,971 --> 02:35:15,370
on Twitter who started following
me after the first show.

4933
02:35:15,820 --> 02:35:16,230
Uh,

4934
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:20,770
and who got excited about bitcoin but
complete strangers in the street and

4935
02:35:20,771 --> 02:35:21,401
things like that.

4936
02:35:21,401 --> 02:35:21,821
And yes,

4937
02:35:21,821 --> 02:35:24,430
I get my share of crazies
and stalkers and all of that.

4938
02:35:24,431 --> 02:35:28,480
And it doesn't matter because the vast
majority is such a positive experience.

4939
02:35:28,900 --> 02:35:32,920
And what everyone says is that
you asked really great questions.

4940
02:35:32,921 --> 02:35:35,350
You asked the every man
questions the question,

4941
02:35:35,351 --> 02:35:40,060
everybody wanted to ask the
simple questions that to
try to understand and grasp

4942
02:35:40,061 --> 02:35:41,380
this topic.

4943
02:35:41,381 --> 02:35:44,470
And for me that was a
wonderful opportunity.

4944
02:35:44,471 --> 02:35:45,200
So thank you.

4945
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:45,891
Thank you.

4946
02:35:45,891 --> 02:35:46,310
Listen.

4947
02:35:46,310 --> 02:35:50,480
The beautiful thing about having a podcast
is nobody brings anything on the show

4948
02:35:50,481 --> 02:35:51,620
that I'm not interested in.

4949
02:35:51,770 --> 02:35:55,010
It's not like a network demands that
I interviewed this guy who was on this

4950
02:35:55,011 --> 02:35:56,180
sitcom or something like that.

4951
02:35:56,450 --> 02:35:57,530
If I'm talking to somebody,

4952
02:35:57,531 --> 02:36:02,000
it's because the subject is fascinating
and that it's actually something I'm

4953
02:36:02,030 --> 02:36:07,030
truly interested in and that's not
having all those sort of like ladders and

4954
02:36:08,301 --> 02:36:12,460
steps that you have to climb
to put content out is really
what it's all about in

4955
02:36:12,470 --> 02:36:14,900
in a way that sort of
mirrors what bitcoin is.

4956
02:36:15,090 --> 02:36:19,640
It's cutting out all the steps that
are unnecessary between human beings

4957
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:20,690
interacting with each other,

4958
02:36:20,691 --> 02:36:23,990
whether it's exchanging money or
exchanging ideas and information.

4959
02:36:23,991 --> 02:36:24,824
It's essentially,

4960
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:28,640
it's a lot of it is along the same
trend and it's all along the same lines.

4961
02:36:28,730 --> 02:36:29,060
Yeah.

4962
02:36:29,060 --> 02:36:29,721
Let's get you,

4963
02:36:29,721 --> 02:36:31,340
let's get you selling
your products on the,

4964
02:36:31,341 --> 02:36:33,500
on it and the other sites with a well

4965
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:34,540
make it happen with bitcoin.

4966
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:35,830
[inaudible] dot com yeah.

4967
02:36:35,870 --> 02:36:36,010
Oh,

4968
02:36:36,010 --> 02:36:36,371
by the way,

4969
02:36:36,371 --> 02:36:39,720
higher primate.com has new
shit in a higher priority.

4970
02:36:39,730 --> 02:36:40,660
We just restocked it.

4977
02:36:52,270 --> 02:36:53,103
All right,

4978
02:36:53,290 --> 02:36:53,741
we're out of here.

is that on iTunes as well as episodes?

4988

Do you have out there a hundred?

4989
02:37:09,821 --> 02:37:11,600
We just celebrated 100 episodes.

4990

Wheezes a hundred episodes a one.
