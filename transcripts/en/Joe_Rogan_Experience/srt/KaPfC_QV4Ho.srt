1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:04,421
Dog.

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,220
I had an old parable about a month ago.

3
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:07,480
I found the back of my draw.

4
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:07,900
That thing,

5
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,490
fuck me up 12 hours.

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,850
That's like an expired viking and
you would take an expired viking.

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,530
You won't have paid for a week.

8
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,583
Mouth.

9
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,410
I don't care how many
root canals they give you.

10
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,040
Broad.

11
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,950
Tom Looks fired.

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,930
Biking with my pants,

13
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,230
my wife and watch that tape had a viking.

14
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,220
I popped that motherfucking
after it was wash.

15
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,223
Oh,

16
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,100
I'm going to have a job

17
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,370
fucking bleach on it.

18
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,330
I just found it.

19
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,760
I found it even on the vikings.

20
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:37,594
I took one hour,

21
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:37,990
he caves.

22
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,580
I had to pay and those pain,

23
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,590
I never wore those pants again.

24
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,260
I go to porn and I go on
the pants and that Ar,

25
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:46,600
she washed it right
before I went on stage.

26
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:47,230
I pop that up.

27
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,100
That motherfucker

28
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,980
who gives a fuck.

29
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:54,700
I don't even know what is the
more I've been through everything.

30
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:55,750
One fucking pulling.

31
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:56,940
I do that dog.

32
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,173
Oh,

33
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,080
how strong was it?

34
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,101
Oh my God.

35
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,820
I picked a half on stage and I
blacked out like the first 30 minutes.

36
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,860
I couldn't wait to get
back to the hotel room,

37
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:06,131
feet.

38
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:06,420
The other.
