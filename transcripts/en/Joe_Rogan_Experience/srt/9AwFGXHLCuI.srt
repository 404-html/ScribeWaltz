1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,420
Tone,
tone,

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,583
tone down,

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,480
and we're live.
Let's have a toast to hugh hefner.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,613
Yes.
We lost one of the Great Dick slingers 

5
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:20,390
of the 20th century.
Certainly did we lost him.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,780
He literally had a place where guys 
could go to be latches.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,963
Yeah.
If you could just go and you had a 

8
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:28,754
mansion where everybody knew there was 
going to be a bunch of hoes and that's 

9
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:31,880
why they went.
Yeah.

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,753
They went there on purpose and it was 
guys that were notorious for hanging 

11
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:38,640
around the mansion for going to all the 
mansion parties.

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,390
Did you ever go?
I went twice.

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,710
I went once for a marijuana policy 
project thing.

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,260
I think that was the company that was 
putting it together.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,833
A or a hosted something and there was 
bands and stuff like that was kind of 

16
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:53,240
interesting.
That's fun.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,060
And then the other time I went was for 
fear factor.

18
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,270
We did something for fear factor with 
the playboy playmates.

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,200
Do you have to meet?
He'll.

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,600
I never met him in.
No,

21
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:03,980
never met him.
He's just,

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,083
I think by that time he's.
He's an old and I think he just wanted 

23
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,350
to chill.
Yeah,

24
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:11,510
he was just kinda done.
I never went there.

25
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:14,210
I tried to get into girl,
tried to get me in and I guess they.

26
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,640
They googled me and she goes,
I guess I have enough credits.

27
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,540
Oh,
come on,

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,373
sit.
What it was I couldn't get in and she's 

29
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:20,120
like,
they have to look you up.

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,580
And she was nice,
but they said no.

31
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,470
How long ago was this?
Probably two years ago.

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,790
Oh my God.
I know.

33
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,103
I didn't qualify to go.
Like I didn't qualify to go with his 

34
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:30,044
fucking girls and fucking crazy.
You didn't have enough credits I guess 

35
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:37,850
sell or maybe they didn't have the right
credits or maybe they just didn't care,

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,300
like whatever.

37
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,980
You know what I mean?
I didn't,

38
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,980
I wasn't even that mad,
but I was like,

39
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:41,270
ah,
whatever.

40
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:43,130
How credits.
Yeah.

41
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,090
Oh,
gross.

42
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,530
Yeah,
she said something like that,

43
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:46,364
but she was trying to be really nice,
like she was trying to let me down easy 

44
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:50,930
because she felt bad because we were 
friends since you wanted to go,

45
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:54,050
like you just don't qualify to come here
and look at these tits.

46
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,763
Just really hurtful.
It was a weird place because it was 

47
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:00,560
super outdated,
like you heard about the grotto,

48
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,933
the grotto,
you go to the grotto and has a phone 

49
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:05,000
from like the 19 seventies there and 
you're like,

50
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:05,834
what is this?
They left it like for probably for the 

51
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,870
vibe,
the old school vibe I guess,

52
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,110
or they just never updated.
It was weirdly,

53
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,200
you know,
he's sold the place or it was for sale,

54
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,243
but one of the caveats of purchase was 
that he had to live in the building 

55
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,410
until he died.

56
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

57
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,370
But it was like some preposterous amount
of money,

58
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:27,950
like $200,
million dollars or something crazy.

59
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,390
Well,
the land is really valuable.

60
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,060
So what do they do at that now?
Do they knock it down?

61
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,800
I mean,
is there no nostalgia to it?

62
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:37,170
Is it kind of died on the vine anyway?
Or do you fucking shit?

63
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,670
Well he has a son and his son probably 
inherited it.

64
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,100
His son I think was running the 
magazine.

65
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,190
They tried for awhile to have no nudity.
Oh,

66
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,900
terrible idea.
It's like fucking mechanic fucking thing

67
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:53,180
with no cars in it.
Who wants to just read that shit?

68
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,103
Stupid.
It's like having a New York Times 

69
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:58,230
article with all ads.
Like what do you.

70
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,970
Where's the fucking intellectual 
stimulation here?

71
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,150
You fucking idiots.
That's a really bad note.

72
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,620
Annuity is a terrible decision.
Yeah.

73
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,100
Well,
they were always in this weird area,

74
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:09,430
right?

75
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,430
Because Hugh hefner was like the only 
acceptable pornographer like Larry Flynt

76
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,753
who did a lot for free speech,
who did a lot for exposing corrupt 

77
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:23,620
politicians,
but they would show vaginas and assholes

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,530
and because of that he was always 
thought as a gross guy.

79
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,260
Yeah.
Well even their social commentary was.

80
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,080
I remember when I was a kid,
that was one it ma.

81
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,980
Who is the feminist?
Gloria?

82
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,300
Gloria allred.
Oh my God.

83
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,780
I know and I think it was a gloria 
steinem parody,

84
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,740
but it was like,
you know,

85
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,650
her licking the girl's pussy that had 
period blood.

86
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,493
It was like some fucking viral thing.
He would do the most viable political 

87
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:48,244
color.
He really showed his disdain of those 

88
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:50,800
people.
He was great.

89
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,780
He's a crazy guy.
He's still alive.

90
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:54,610
That fucker.
He gets shot,

91
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,970
you know,
and paralyzed like way back in the day,

92
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:58,804
right?
Yeah.

93
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,040
Seventy seven maybe.

94
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,710
Was it that lady?
I think it was [inaudible] 76.

95
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,131
Yeah.
Yeah.

96
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:05,350
He's still got a bunch of casinos and 
stuff.

97
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,210
He still out there kicking it,
but like who the hell is buying hustler?

98
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,530
I'm,
I a lot.

99
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,120
It's funny you mentioned that.
I had my manager got one today.

100
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,130
I haven't bought one in many years 
because there's a.

101
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:15,964
I did an interview for them and it was 
actually a really good interview and 

102
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,890
they quoted me accurately,
so I'm in December's Hustler,

103
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:22,420
which is after today.
Wow.

104
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,313
So it's funny.
I bought a hostel for the first time 

105
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:28,060
probably in 15 years today.
What magazines do that or December comes

106
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:29,140
out installed.
No,

107
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,720
that's so fucking stupid.
Why don't we pretend it's like new cars.

108
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,030
It's a 2018.
We'll have the fuck.

109
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:36,990
Is that even possible since 2017 
monkeys.

110
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,863
I,
it's gotta be something about the 

111
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:39,770
anticipation of getting it.

112
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,603
It's almost like when a halloween movie 
doesn't come out October 30th because 

113
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,743
you're sick of Halloween by then,
so it comes out like you say September 

114
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:49,480
15th and then by the time Halloween 
comes the movie's finished.

115
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:49,990
You're like,
oh,

116
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,890
fuck.
Halloween.

117
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,660
No,
but that makes sense because they're not

118
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:55,210
pretending it's halloween.
It's just a halloween movie.

119
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,044
Right?
Like they're pretending that's a 

120
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:58,540
December issue,
but it's not decided.

121
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,560
It's not.
Yeah.

122
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:00,394
I don't know the thinking.
They come out like way in advance 

123
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:03,310
usually a month of before,
but December.

124
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,203
This is kind of the new car thing.
It was always weird because it's way 

125
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:08,050
ahead.
Six months.

126
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,003
Yeah,
like six,

127
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,533
six months before the year turns over.
They're already saying that it's a 2018 

128
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:17,520
model,
but it's like it's 2017.

129
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,840
April when you're talking about is not 
the 2018 model.

130
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,210
It's like weird.
It's like tricks,

131
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:23,044
you know,
it's like when you buy something and it 

132
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,930
costs $9,
99 make it $10.

133
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,490
You Fuck?
What is this?

134
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,950
What does this penny stuff they want to 
say under $10?

135
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:30,910
Yeah.
I,

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,990
I don't,
I don't understand.

137
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,500
It just looks better with the 99 then 
the Ta.

138
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,090
I don't get it either,
but it does for dumb people.

139
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,050
Yeah.
That's what it is.

140
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,810
It's like you're.
You're appealing to people's mind.

141
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,823
Like the little part of their mind is 
trying to save a little better and 

142
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,360
better sound better.
I don't know.

143
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,030
I mean comedians have addressed the gas 
thing for years.

144
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,910
There was a book about this.
It's called predictably irrational.

145
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,990
The hidden forces that shape our 
decisions.

146
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,070
That came out about

147
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,770
10 years ago maybe.
Interesting.

148
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,663
So it's playing,
playing on the irrational thoughts that 

149
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,054
we have about like specific anecdotes 
about like say like a best buy ad and 

150
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:10,064
why there's three.
My washing machines and they're really 

151
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,380
trying to get you to buy the middle one,
but they have two other priced ones goes

152
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:18,170
into things just like that.
All over different aspects of life.

153
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,273
You all.
My favorite ones are when you're in 

154
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:24,530
Vegas and you see voted Best Buffet,
best 10:00

155
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,650
PM show like Pi.
Who who voted for the best buffet?

156
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,050
They did vote on it.
Why?

157
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,840
Who are they?
Do they have to leave the house?

158
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:33,674
Like,
are you going to fucking buffet voters 

159
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,500
in 20 minutes?
We're going to miss the buffet vote.

160
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,433
Who Cares?
But there is good buffets in bad 

161
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:40,910
buffet's right.
Like,

162
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:43,040
where's a good buffet and big.
Do you ever go to the buffets?

163
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,900
I fucking love a good buffet if you 
want.

164
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,390
The trophy is great rules.
Nice.

165
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,870
The Wynn hotel in Vegas has a tremendous
buffet.

166
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,681
Well,
the wind hotels,

167
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:52,730
tremendous.
Period.

168
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,470
I've walked through it but I've never 
stayed there.

169
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,320
It's a phenomenal hotel.
It's like a very high end place.

170
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:01,370
So it makes sense that their buffet 
would kick ass in here in la.

171
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:02,630
They have a good one,
uh,

172
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,464
at the um,
the four seasons on Sundays as I 

173
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,130
might've said.
Delight to buffet.

174
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,973
Yeah.
Oh,

175
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,470
I've done the four seasons in Maui and 
they have a breakfast buffet.

176
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,390
Oh,
what a great way to get fat.

177
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,260
It is,
right?

178
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,280
Oh,
it's tremendous.

179
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:19,130
They make you waffles.
They have the waffle thing right there.

180
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,173
Something about someone making you a 
wall when they pour the waffle stuff 

181
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,640
into that,
a little press and put it down.

182
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:26,271
You're like,
oh,

183
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:26,490
I'm gonna.

184
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,323
Have a waffle.
I'm just thinking right now about 

185
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:29,954
melting the butter on it and before you 
know what I did last time I put peanut 

186
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:38,600
butter all over that motherfucker and 
then I put butter and then I put syrup.

187
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,183
Yeah,
I felt great for about 15 minutes and 

188
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:46,970
then afterwards I just want to.
But you feel fucking terrible.

189
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,440
Wow.
Much as you work out.

190
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:49,274
Like I'm surprised like you don't 
because you burn through everything you 

191
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:51,651
eat.
Yeah,

192
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:52,640
but you know what it is,
man.

193
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:54,560
It has nothing to do with that.
It's an insulin pump.

194
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,633
Your body just hits all that sugar into 
your system and you bought us like what 

195
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,233
the fuck is this?
And it's actually probably worse for me 

196
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:06,980
because I don't do it very often.
Like if your body gets used to sugar,

197
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:07,814
if you're drinking sugary sodas all day 
and you're eating white bread all day 

198
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,030
and if your body gets used to processing
that stuff,

199
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,730
it has a better handle on what to do 
with it.

200
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,070
Whereas with me,
it only gets it every few days.

201
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,260
So when it gets it,
it's like,

202
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,450
what the fuck is this?
Especially like if I overload,

203
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:24,284
like get crazy,
eat a banana split or something like 

204
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:26,950
that.
Like Ah.

205
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,430
You feel it?
Oh yeah.

206
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,860
I worked hard.
I'm bad in la though with food.

207
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:32,990
Like I fucking go out for Sushi and 
that,

208
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:33,824
that yogurt stop on Santa Monica.
It's my favorite place in the world was 

209
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,730
then cheese.
No,

210
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,030
it's called the yogurts dot.
Oh,

211
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:39,864
okay.
It's on Santa Monica and I been there 

212
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:43,250
for days where I've been in La for four 
days.

213
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:44,084
I've been there four times.
I can't stop shoveling that shit and 

214
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,860
it's my favorite fucking place.
Why is it so good?

215
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,970
I don't know,
man.

216
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:52,460
I've had yogurt that was just as good.
It just,

217
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:53,294
I,
I'd always felt right to go out for the 

218
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:55,980
best Sushi and then go

219
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,450
down there and have some yogurt.
Stop.

220
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,820
Treat yourself a little jimmy.
You doing good with your life?

221
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,630
Well,
you know,

222
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,110
I was having a sad day Monday and 
literally like a fucking fat girl.

223
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,830
I got my ex girlfriend who's my best 
friend and we went and got yogurt.

224
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,800
I'm like,
I'm really sad.

225
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,980
And we went and got.
I treated myself to a little yogurt.

226
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,280
I just go up and down.
I'm just relationship nonsense.

227
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,200
I'm a fatalist,
but you're doing great.

228
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,250
I will do it.
Okay.

229
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,370
Do you know how many people would 
fucking kill to be in your position?

230
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:22,650
Successful touring,
standup comedian?

231
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:23,484
Sure.
Assessable podcast or successful radio 

232
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:27,300
personality.
Loved by all.

233
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,193
Chip has a great podcast or that's who 
the successful podcast and the Norton 

234
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:31,963
Empire is.
The fucking thing that you do with Matt 

235
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:33,551
said,
Sarah,

236
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:36,360
you guys have like the best mma podcasts
in the world.

237
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,830
Thank you.
We have a lot of fun with that,

238
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:38,664
man.
Thank you.

239
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,110
It's great.
I Love Matt.

240
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,060
We talked about the last time.
I love him too,

241
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,110
but it's A.
Yeah,

242
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:43,944
it's one of those things where like,
I know that and I know that it's a fun 

243
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,270
Gig and I love doing it,
but it's one of those things.

244
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:49,590
It's not about like feeling like I've 
been.

245
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,350
I haven't been blessed like show 
business given me opportunities.

246
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:54,600
I've failed,
but I'm not some unlucky guy who,

247
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,860
gee,
they didn't give me a shot.

248
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,010
They give me a million shots.
It's about being annoyed at yourself for

249
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:00,870
certain things,
so it's not about like,

250
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:02,430
I get a good apartment,
I make money.

251
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,110
I am very lucky,
but it's the rational,

252
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:08,280
like when you're feeling down,
you're like a rational thing.

253
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,660
No,
you can't.

254
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,640
You can't turn it around with your mind.

255
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,530
No,
I'm too emotional.

256
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,870
I react to emotionally,
but the next day,

257
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:16,704
like I had a great week since then get 
out because she and I talked and I 

258
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:21,350
realized I'm just being kind of fucking 
crazy girlfriends.

259
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,081
Shit.
Yeah.

260
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:25,170
But I'm also not cheating,
but I don't know how to not cheat so I'm

261
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,060
not acting out.
It's fucking crazy man.

262
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,953
Oh,
so maybe part of your weirdnesses like 

263
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,083
dealing with the fact that you're not 
expressing your normal behavior 

264
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:33,660
patterns?
Yeah,

265
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:34,494
it's giving up.
It's like it's given you have a huge 

266
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,430
addiction.
Like I still,

267
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:38,940
I still look at porn and stuff,
but not acting out.

268
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,580
Not Having fucking girls.
The La is a deadly city for me.

269
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,740
Why do I come out here?
I got him fucking not deadly pussy.

270
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,540
Well,
sometimes when I'm out here,

271
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,140
I'm a very fresh boy.
Very Naughty.

272
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,413
I behave better now.
There's a whole ecosystem around that 

273
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:02,010
here.
There really is a lot of gals that are a

274
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:05,880
little loose with the sex and they've 
decided to profit off of that.

275
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,893
Yeah.
And they don't just have sex with some 

276
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,234
men and not have to work a job and some 
of them are literally just people I've 

277
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,624
known for a lot like there,
like people you meet through the 

278
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:17,100
business and they're just as dangerous 
because.

279
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:19,200
And I mean for me because they'll do 
anything.

280
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,231
And uh,
because they,

281
00:11:20,231 --> 00:11:21,780
they liked the fact that I'm open.
So they're like,

282
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,160
oh my God,
guys think I'm crazy.

283
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,160
Like,
so it's hard just not to be unfaithful.

284
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,370
It's hard to not be fucking [inaudible] 
fans are.

285
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,620
I've been talking about this for a week.
So I would up and down.

286
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:34,180
I've had sad that I'm great and I'm just
getting.

287
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,870
I don't have a girlfriend in six years 
and I'm talking about it.

288
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:38,320
And then one fans like,
are we getting it?

289
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,990
You're going to girl friend.
You're 49,

290
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,520
you're being normal.
It's like,

291
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:43,380
Jesus,
you fucking rotten toad.

292
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,870
Can I talk about my life being healthy 
for one week before fans get sick of it?

293
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,133
Well,
you're always going to get one person 

294
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:51,660
who complains about everything.
Yeah.

295
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,250
I can't really bother.
You know,

296
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:54,084
it's just like,

297
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,390
yeah,
you're going to get that.

298
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,980
I mean,
and he's got a point two.

299
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,050
It's probably annoying to him,
which is why he said it,

300
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,480
but she or she.
Yeah.

301
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,010
Well,
shut her mouth.

302
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,750
Fuck you.
No Bitch.

303
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,550
I gave her.
I gave her a sarcastic apology.

304
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:10,211
I was like,
sorry,

305
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:12,100
I didn't mean to share something good.
Only keep it negative.

306
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:13,420
And she actually went back.
It's all good.

307
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,160
Like she believed the apology.
Oh,

308
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:16,450
that's hilarious.
Well,

309
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,323
there's a fake feud going on between me 
and Ari and Bert Kreischer and Thompson 

310
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,723
and people for whatever reason think 
it's real and so they're getting mad 

311
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:26,890
that I'm airing out our dirty laundry in
public,

312
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,430
but I couldn't be more obvious about how
fake it is.

313
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,350
I even wrote,
good day sir,

314
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,860
at the end of my letter with all caps.
I mean it's just.

315
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,080
This is like a new thing.
Pray for Joe.

316
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,150
This is what it is.
Bert Kreischer,

317
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:40,990
our friend,
good friend.

318
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:42,910
Bert is a fucking raging alcoholic.
He certainly,

319
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:45,550
he drinks six doubles a night.
Yeah,

320
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,800
he's drinking 12 drinks a night and I 
go,

321
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:48,700
are you serious?
He goes,

322
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,534
every night.
I go,

323
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,950
wow,
that is crazy.

324
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:53,350
I can't even imagine doing that.
That's incredible.

325
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,100
So we said,
do you think you'd get sober?

326
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,290
He said yes.
Okay.

327
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,300
So then someone said sober and run a 
marathon.

328
00:12:58,301 --> 00:12:59,590
I was like,
stop you guys.

329
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,030
He's going to die.
Yeah,

330
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,790
because first of all,
burt likes to pretend he runs,

331
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,890
but he really only runs on a treadmill 
and I'm like,

332
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:06,724
that is not running.
You're lifting your legs up and the 

333
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:10,000
things coming towards you,
it's not the same.

334
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,300
So now we started running on the 
railroad and he's like barely getting in

335
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:15,820
a couple miles and he takes a lot of 
breaks.

336
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,683
He's not running any fucking marathons 
anytime soon and I'm certainly not 

337
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:20,380
saying that he could do one after a 
month.

338
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,330
Right.
So we said,

339
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:23,164
okay,
how about no drinking for the entire 

340
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,700
month of October and you got to do 15 
hot yoga classes in a month,

341
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,910
which is fucking hardcore hardcore.
I've done it.

342
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:35,590
I love hot yoga,
but it really does.

343
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:37,780
Where it really wipes you out,
it wipes you out.

344
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:40,180
Especially if you're not used to it and 
you don't drink enough water,

345
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:41,014
you've got to really be behind the ball.
So everybody agreed to that and then a 

346
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:45,310
couple of fucking days ago they started 
saying,

347
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,410
we're going to be totally sober.
No weed,

348
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,280
no alcohol.
I go,

349
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:48,931
Whoa,
Whoa,

350
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:49,764
Whoa,
whoa.

351
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,160
First of all,
you fucks.

352
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,260
I'm only doing this to try to see if we 
can get burt soap.

353
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,090
I don't need to not drink.
I could not drink for months.

354
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:00,790
It doesn't bother me.
Like me taking a month off of booze.

355
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,813
It doesn't bother me at all,
but me taking a month off a weed is 

356
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:05,140
like,
how do you expect me to write?

357
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,080
I,
I use it to write.

358
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,680
I use it to think about things.
I use it to enjoy things.

359
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:12,514
I use it as a like a sacrament almost.
Do you ever think of trying a month 

360
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,813
without you knowing you're going to go 
back to it and that you're not doing a 

361
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:20,504
direct of it,
but I know want to be bullied by a 

362
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:25,480
welcher yeah,
no fear was supposed to see Burton.

363
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,440
Tom had a fucking contest and they were.
If they lost 25 pounds,

364
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,550
it was supposed to take them on a trip 
to wherever they chose and Tom wanted to

365
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:34,384
go to Europe to watch a soccer game and 
burt wanted to go to watch some crazy 

366
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:38,074
football game and already completely 
welch on the bed and then took off and 

367
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:43,780
went to Asia for four months and left me
holding the bag.

368
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,873
Not only did he take off,
he took off and went off the grid and 

369
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:49,390
don't think the two aren't related shift
fear.

370
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,223
I know what the fuck you're up to.
You didn't feel any responsibility to 

371
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,530
pay that bet you son of a bitch.
Anyway.

372
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,693
I wound up getting them.
What do I get them tickets to wake some 

373
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,370
basketball game.
That game.

374
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:00,230
Yeah,
there's a big game,

375
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:00,720
right?
Yeah.

376
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,740
So it was a big deal.
Flew him out first class the whole deal,

377
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:06,110
put them up in a nice hotel,
paid for everything,

378
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,003
so I paid for it and because they did 
actually lose the weight and so they're 

379
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:11,054
like,
we gotta come up with a new test and 

380
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,334
somehow or another I got involved in Ra 
got involved too and they're trying to 

381
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:17,174
shame me into quitting pot.
It's like I stopped smoking pot all the 

382
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:21,164
time when I go on vacation,
I don't smoke pot for a week at a time 

383
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,790
when I go anywhere where I'm,
you know,

384
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,700
I,
if I'm in Europe for 10 days,

385
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:29,534
I'm not smoking weed.

386
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,170
It's not an addictive issue,
but it's something that I enjoy.

387
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,333
I could stop doing things that I enjoy,
but it sounds like an addict saying 

388
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:39,170
this,
I don't have a problem with it,

389
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,880
but I really don't have a problem with 
it.

390
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,440
I like it.
I like pod.

391
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,274
I'm not willing to not do it for an 
alcoholic friend and a welcher and then 

392
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,090
thompson girls dressing up like a 
medicine man lately.

393
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,550
Like what the fuck is he doing?
He's wearing,

394
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,060
he's wearing some crazy steven seagal 
outfit.

395
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:57,530
He's got wooden beads on and shit and 
some crazy hat.

396
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,050
Or they loose fitting clothes.
What he's wearing.

397
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,260
Yeah.
No,

398
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,980
no.
He's in tremendous shape.

399
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:04,730
Oh,
good for Tom.

400
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,563
Tom Lost the weight and kept the weight 
off because Tom is like really 

401
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:09,230
disciplined,
you know,

402
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:13,280
which is why he just did another netflix
special and like three and a half,

403
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:13,910
four years.

404
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,290
He's done three Netflix.
Got.

405
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,400
Yeah,
he's a.

406
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,050
he's an animal.
There he is.

407
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:20,300
Look at his hat.
Just fucking hat.

408
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,290
Jesus Christ.
Wow.

409
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,210
Nice beer too.
Good frosting and the beard.

410
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:24,230
Nice and trim.
It looks good.

411
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,060
I love it.
But he's fucking healthy.

412
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:29,120
Look up the thinness faces,
but look at the picture above that.

413
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,320
Above that.
That one.

414
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,420
See if we get a fucking outfit.
Oh my God.

415
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,720
Pete's the feathers and shit.
Who Does he look like?

416
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,300
Who Does that outfit look like?
I've seen that photo shopped.

417
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,050
I'm sure.
What?

418
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,490
What does that outfit from that looked 
like?

419
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,860
It was weird.
Who dresses like that?

420
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,420
Likes the golf.
It's looks like Steven Seagal to me.

421
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,333
The smoke in the back.
It could be like some Buddhist monk or 

422
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:52,310
something like that,
but uh,

423
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,730
these motherfuckers are trying to shame 
me and it's to quitting.

424
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,050
We'd some happening for us.

425
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,033
In fact,
I'm going to get high every day in 

426
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:00,044
October.
You haven't thought of trying to just 

427
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,440
for a month to see it,
to see how,

428
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,060
like if it gets weird for you,
it might be.

429
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,040
You might get some really good shit out 
of it if you're cooling.

430
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,150
Yeah,
I mean I would,

431
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,860
but maybe another month.
Maybe I'll do it in November,

432
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:10,760
November,
but these,

433
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,520
this month they can suck my dick.
I'm going to get high every day.

434
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,470
You won't be shamed into it.
You'll do it when you want to do it.

435
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,190
I'll do it if I want to do and if I 
really had an issue.

436
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:19,851
If I'm like,
man,

437
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:21,790
I can't get a day without.
If,

438
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,873
if I felt like I was reaching for it to 
do things like I haven't smoked pot 

439
00:17:25,341 --> 00:17:28,250
today.
Today I went running to a podcast.

440
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:30,020
I like to smoke a little weed before 
podcast,

441
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:31,550
but nothing today.
Nothing.

442
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,140
Zero.
No issues.

443
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,120
Yeah.
I think it would affect me differently.

444
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,050
Have you ever used you as a good example
of a guy like you?

445
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:40,100
You function well,
like you smoke pot and you do Jujitsu.

446
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:40,963
Like I didn't do that well.
A lot of people that do Jujitsu smoke 

447
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:43,790
pot,
it's.

448
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,623
It's huge and the Jiu Jitsu community 
you would think like a lot of people 

449
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:47,744
have a misconception of Jujitsu where 
they think of it as being a bunch of 

450
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:50,040
like

451
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,873
really aggressive,
mean guys that are like attacking each 

452
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,074
other,
but it's more much more bunch of really 

453
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:58,794
smart analytical stoner sensitive nerd 
type characters who are also like very 

454
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:04,644
strong because they do Jujitsu all the 
time or if they lift weights and get in 

455
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:09,090
really good shape.
A lot of those guys,

456
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:09,924
it's because of Jujitsu and then of 
course there's people that come to it 

457
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:15,030
from like football or wrestling or 
something like that.

458
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:17,580
They have a different attitude,
but a lot of times they fall into like a

459
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:21,090
Jujitsu mindset which is a very relaxed,
friendly mindset.

460
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:21,924
Jujitsu people are super friendly,
very affectionate to like all the guys 

461
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:27,890
that met very huggy and friendly and 
it's A.

462
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,870
I have noticed a lot of combat athletes 
are like that,

463
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,943
but there's a gentleness to it.
Like we see Bernard Hopkins I've talked 

464
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:35,400
to a lot and when you.

465
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,310
He sits right next to you and literally 
he's a speed invade your space,

466
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,980
but it doesn't feel menacing or,
or weird.

467
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:42,720
It feels like almost like he's just an 
affectionate,

468
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,583
gentle guy until it's an odd feeling how
you get energy from people and it just 

469
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:47,970
doesn't feel uncomfortable.
Well,

470
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:50,550
you know where the garlic Bernard,
he's so confident in himself.

471
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:53,670
He doesn't exude any insecurities or 
whiteness.

472
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:55,380
I mean,
he's an all time great period.

473
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,243
There's no,
there's not a single human being that 

474
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,630
knows boxing that would argue that 
Bernard Hopkins is at an all time.

475
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:03,170
Right.
I remember when he fought Tito Trinidad.

476
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,023
You ever see that fight?
He fought Felix Trinidad and I believe 

477
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:07,164
he was 36 at the time and Trinidad was 
in his prime and everybody really 

478
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:13,050
thought the Trinity.
I was going to run them over and he beat

479
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:13,884
the fucking shit out of Trinidad and it 
was a weird controversial fight because 

480
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,443
he was in Puerto Rico and he took the 
Puerto Rican flag and threw it on the 

481
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:22,710
ground and everybody went crazy and he 
wanted to kill him.

482
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,783
Yeah.
He wanted to get inside Trinidad's head 

483
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,730
and get them,
get them to try to brawl with him.

484
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,620
And he did.
Bernard picked him apart.

485
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,523
Well,
he picked him apart and fucked him up 

486
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,390
and then years later when people wrote 
them off again,

487
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:34,224
he fought Kelly pavlick and this is 
after Kelly pavlock and knocked out 

488
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:40,020
Jermaine Stewart and he was thought to 
be like the guy,

489
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,460
you know,
and everybody was like,

490
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:42,294
Kelly Pavlics gonna fuck up or an art 
hopkins and Bernard Hopkins beat the 

491
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,653
shit out of him too.
Who did finally knocked him his last 

492
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:51,330
fight that will smith.
He was 51.

493
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,710
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure.

494
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,190
I'm sure it was either 50 or 51.
He wanted to be 50.

495
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:57,210
I remember,
I think he had 40,

496
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,073
49 fights or whatever.
I know he wanted to fight when he was 

497
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:01,104
50.
He wanted to Fight Mayweather for his 

498
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:04,254
50th fight.

499
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,093
That was.
I remember him talking about that right 

500
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:08,260
before he turned 50.
He was talking to her.

501
00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:09,840
Would never fight him.
He's so much bigger.

502
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,703
Yeah.
I guess he was talking about cutting 

503
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:13,950
weight or maybe it was just saying that,
but he talked about fighting floyd floyd

504
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,070
coming up at him going down.
If I was Florida,

505
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:17,904
I'd say fuck that.
The flight Pi did because he never 

506
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:20,574
fought him about.
But I think that he was talking about 

507
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,040
that when he was 49.
Yeah,

508
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,280
because floyd is a tiny man.
Yeah.

509
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,140
I mean floyd is a natural 147 pound 
fighter.

510
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,600
Like when he weighed in for the fight 
with conor,

511
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:35,340
you weighed 1:49
and Bernard was fighting one 75.

512
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,020
It's just so much larger.
Yeah.

513
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:40,350
Maybe he was talking about coming down 
and I don't remember the conversation,

514
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:42,670
but obviously they would have had to 
have a catch.

515
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,980
Right.
But he fought this guy,

516
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:44,814
Joe Smith Jr,
who's a young guy who's a murderous and 

517
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:51,040
he just got fucked up and not through 
the ropes and he fell on his head.

518
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,670
It was horrible.
Yeah.

519
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,310
But he had such a great,
huge bound to get,

520
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:56,200
you know,
he had to go down sooner or later.

521
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,513
But uh,
yeah,

522
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,480
just uh,
like a nice dude and uh,

523
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,363
I love guys like that who don't try to 
give off just that shitty energy and I 

524
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:06,940
don't think I've ever gotten that energy
off of fighters.

525
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,893
Well you won't get it off the successful
ones because to get successful you want 

526
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:15,691
to have as few things that are in your 
way that are cumbersome as possible.

527
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,133
Few Ego issues and a few distorted 
perceptions of reality as possible in 

528
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:26,200
order to weave your way through to the 
top.

529
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:26,710
Yeah.
No,

530
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:31,360
I mean there's exceptions to that where 
you have a phenomenal physical specimens

531
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:32,194
that are incredibly dedicated and 
dealing with a lot of demons like Tyson 

532
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:36,590
in his prime,
you know,

533
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:37,424
but I don't know if that would work in 
them and may the same way it worked in 

534
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:40,090
boxing.

535
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,000
Like I just don't know,
with all the variables and boxing,

536
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:47,050
like with Tyson or an mma rather with 
Tyson in his prime,

537
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,410
he could just weighed towards God's Bob 
and weave and throw bombs and,

538
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,273
and figure out a way to just smash them.
He was just so much faster than 

539
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:55,234
everybody.
And he hit so hard and they were afraid 

540
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:57,634
of him.
Yeah.

541
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,863
But I wonder if you're ever get to see 
that kind of person dominate the way 

542
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:06,100
Tyson did as a MMA fighter.
Like I just don't know.

543
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,563
It's weird.
I never care what their face looks like 

544
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,720
when they walk into the ring.
Like,

545
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:12,060
you know,
when you don't watch videos,

546
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:12,431
like,
Oh God,

547
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,264
he looks frightening,
but you've pointed it out and he chews 

548
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:16,104
gum.
Annie's high steep and the Oj when he 

549
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:18,760
walks in,
he couldn't look happier.

550
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,673
Oh,
was so calm.

551
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,080
Josie.

552
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,270
Aldo won't look the guy in the eye.
He's terrified.

553
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:23,890
He's just kind of looking down and being
humble,

554
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,083
you know,
none of that stuff seems to work with 

555
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:29,560
those guys because every one of them 
knows there's so many ways to lose.

556
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:30,394
I don't know what it is,
but they don't seem to try that shit 

557
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:34,270
with each other like boxers some guys 
do.

558
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,620
It was a big thing with vandelay Silva,
vandelay stair guys down big time,

559
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,420
you know,
and Mirko Cro.

560
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:43,810
Cop in him had the greatest stare down 
the history of pride.

561
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,390
They're just both staring at each other.
It was super intense.

562
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,610
I remember just like America when you 
talking about his stare,

563
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,680
that's probably what every year he came 
over to.

564
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:55,681
UFC was a 2008 when you were on our show
on k rock and you talking about this Guy

565
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,703
Mirko Cro.
Cop was coming over at his fucking and 

566
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,410
we were watching his stare down.

567
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,660
Look at this.
This is Mirko versus vandal.

568
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,513
Vandal used to intimidate everybody,
but Mirko was the head of an anti 

569
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:09,940
terrorist squadron and Croatia,
he didn't give a fuck.

570
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,980
And he was a world class kickbox.
So like,

571
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:12,814
look how fucking intense lately on.
He's completely unintimidated by that 

572
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:19,630
stare and he beat the holy shit out of 
Angela.

573
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,850
He was the first guy to really flatline.
Vandelay head kicked him into a coma.

574
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,711
Wow.
Yeah.

575
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:27,870
Just blam it was,
uh,

576
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:31,090
the second time they fought,
the first time they fought was his first

577
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:31,924
mma fight and they had all these weird 
wacky rules like there can only be on 

578
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,980
the ground for 30 seconds and they had 
to stand in the back backup,

579
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,900
right?
Yeah.

580
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,050
They,
they hate Mirko wasn't really doing mma.

581
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:44,830
I mean you've sort of training in mma,
but vandelay was a champion.

582
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,943
I mean Jay was a world class fighter and
so they had some sort of a weird 

583
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:53,090
arrangement and the arrangement was like
limited amount of time on the ground and

584
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,700
bunch of other wacky rules in that first
fight.

585
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,010
It was a draw because if no one finished
anyone,

586
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:00,140
that was the other thing.
Nobody finished.

587
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:00,974
Anyway.
They decided that it was going to be a 

588
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:03,890
draw and the rounds were with a 10 
minute rounds.

589
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,430
Well back then they were 10 minute first
rounds and then you'd have a five minute

590
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:11,930
second round in a five minute third 
round if it was a championship fight.

591
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,060
But I think with vander and him they,
they shortened the rounds as well.

592
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,450
I don't remember the whole deal.
But then the second time they fought,

593
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:21,284
it was a legit pride mma fight and Mirko
had already fought a bunch of pride 

594
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:27,134
fights and really got into the groove 
and it become like one of the best 

595
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:31,950
heavyweights alive and he just beat the 
shit out of band that way.

596
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,680
I've never seen that stare down.
That was really intense that,

597
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,910
that was an intimidating stare.

598
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,260
That's Marco and his prime because it's 
moving,

599
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,760
not moving.
Yeah.

600
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:41,960
But that you're right,
if you're dealing with the team,

601
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,970
you're the head of an anti terrorist.
Uh,

602
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,650
yeah.
We've got police group.

603
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,930
I guess there are police could have 
sounded more like a fucking,

604
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,220
like my niece,
the head of it police.

605
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,320
But if you're like an antiterrorism cop,
I mean that's the face you have.

606
00:24:54,321 --> 00:24:55,154
I mean,
you have to get information out of 

607
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:56,414
people,
but he's most likely seen a lot of 

608
00:24:58,071 --> 00:24:59,450
people die,
you think?

609
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:00,400
Yeah.
Yeah.

610
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,510
Croatia is a hard place,
man.

611
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,150
I mean he's,
he's a hard man in a hard place.

612
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,230
And on top of being like a soldier,
he was,

613
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,313
you know,
the best kickboxers alive before he 

614
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:15,010
wanted to mma.
So yeah.

615
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,720
Oh man,
he was amazing.

616
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,940
He was amazing.
He was very good as a kickboxer,

617
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,833
but really came into his own as a MMA 
fighter because his style of kickboxing 

618
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:28,010
was unique,
uniquely effective in mma because he was

619
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:29,480
very explosive and fast.

620
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,960
Whereas a,
some guys would be like more,

621
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,843
there'd be more methodical or technical,
like Ernesto hoost or Peter or some of 

622
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:39,584
these other guys that would,
they would stand in front of guys more 

623
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,220
and just pick their shots better.
Mirko would just blast you with like one

624
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:49,880
or one or two single shots.
But that was way more effective in mma.

625
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,700
Like the explosive really fast style.
Yeah.

626
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,580
I never thought I would like to see a,
uh,

627
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,693
a wonderboy,
one of his kickboxing fights and he was 

628
00:25:57,051 --> 00:25:57,884
like,
like $57 a kickbox and I never watched 

629
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:02,540
him kickbox online.
You can see them online.

630
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
I should do that online because God 
knows what I'm doing.

631
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:07,120
It's not helping me getting off.
So yeah,

632
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,710
I'm trying not to as much,
but it's like there's so many fun things

633
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:10,544
to watch.
I've been think jerking off during the 

634
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,543
day because I,
it's so ritualistic for me that when I 

635
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:17,110
jerk off during the day I'm like,
ah,

636
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,953
okay,
I can be a person and I don't have to 

637
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:21,170
think about that for the rest of the 
day.

638
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,690
It really helps my day go much more 
productive.

639
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:25,700
Have you ever taught a meditating?
Do you meditate at all?

640
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:26,960
No,
I get it like,

641
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:27,794
you know,
uh,

642
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,990
before the,
the,

643
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,680
the,
uh,

644
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,770
we started joe pointed.
He's like,

645
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:31,604
you always have an issue and he's right 
and that's like for me it will be an 

646
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:34,154
itch.
What you were talking about some new 

647
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:37,280
issue with my throat,
but I had that for years.

648
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,730
We're starting certain foods fucked me 
up if that happens to me too though.

649
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,470
Pot does that for sure.
Really?

650
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,680
Yeah,
we smoke too much weed before a show.

651
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:45,514
I'll get Flemmi.
I think it's a combination of many 

652
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:49,620
coffee and eggs,
like the eggs,

653
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:50,454
I think do it.
I went to one of these alternative 

654
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:53,310
doctors.
I thought maybe my,

655
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,870
uh,
my uh,

656
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:56,370
adrenal,
adrenal glands were fucked up.

657
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,443
So he's like,
well you got to cut out the eggs or cut 

658
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:00,940
out the coffee and I can't stop with the
krave.

659
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,200
Fruit's good for before a show like 
apples,

660
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,880
you know,
certain flux behind it.

661
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,140
I went around the corner.
I had one of those veggie thing,

662
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,980
a pure vegetable juice,
splitly,

663
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,823
celery and a fucking vegetable just 
blows because it just dominates the 

664
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:15,810
entire juice.
I hate it.

665
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,300
It's great for cleaning out.
Your system isn't really good for you.

666
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,760
Oh,
throws your fucking pipes free.

667
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,240
Like celery juice is one of the best 
juices.

668
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:26,160
Like if you have to take a shit,
you know,

669
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:26,994
I've been constipated except on a new 
medication that's supposed to cause 

670
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:32,490
diarrhea and I have been,
I have not been shitting and I'm usually

671
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,710
waiting on a medication for.
I just want to call it,

672
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,300
prep it so you don't get HIV and I'm 
negative.

673
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:38,963
I know,
but I need it now because I'm in a 

674
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:42,960
fucking relationship.
But I started to take it.

675
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,520
I'm like,
I'm just going to be smart because I'm a

676
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:47,370
fucking smart to take a medication like 
that.

677
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,430
Like isn't,
aren't there like AIDS medications now?

678
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:53,720
HIV medications are like completely stop
it from there are,

679
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,680
but you don't want to have it.
I don't want to get it.

680
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:56,940
Yeah.
I don't want to get it.

681
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,390
I mean I think I've only taken it for a 
little while and I'm probably going stop

682
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:02,340
because I'm in the relationship and I 
got to go.

683
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,080
They want you to be tested after a month
and make sure that your blood is okay.

684
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:05,701
Get livers.
Okay.

685
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:07,470
Your kidneys,
they want to look you over.

686
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:07,951
Yeah.
Again,

687
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:09,330
off that shit.
Is it bad for you?

688
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,090
I just got to imagine it is.
Anything that.

689
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,060
I mean,
anything that gives you diarrhea?

690
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,420
Well it's only for a few days but it 
didn't give it to me.

691
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:19,740
It literally stopped me from shitting.

692
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,270
Constipation.
It did.

693
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:22,650
Yeah,
it did.

694
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,020
Yeah.
I just,

695
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,290
uh,
I mean,

696
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:29,180
isn't that a thing with like vicodin and
a lot of those pain killers?

697
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,380
It gives you constipation?
Yeah.

698
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:34,290
I've only taken vicodin once,
after I had my sinuses fixed,

699
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,450
but the side,
that prep I took it.

700
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,520
I don't have any more than that.
I like,

701
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,030
I'm going to go back and see the guy and
again,

702
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,100
I don't even know if I'm gonna to do it 
again and take that shit.

703
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,140
I just want.
I was one point I was being crazy,

704
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:43,974
so I'm like,
I just want to make sure I don't get 

705
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:45,890
that.
Yeah,

706
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,750
you know,
I would rather have some kind of a kid.

707
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,950
I knew I wouldn't be on it forever,
but I'm like,

708
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:50,784
while I'm fucking acting like an ass,
let me at least one of the podcast 

709
00:28:55,411 --> 00:28:56,244
episodes that I took the most amount of 
heat for early in the day was I did a 

710
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:00,084
podcast with a guy named Peter Duesberg.
He's a biologist at the University of 

711
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,333
California Berkeley,
and he's a very respected biologist 

712
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,000
who's done a lot of great work on 
cancer,

713
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,763
but he's got a very controversial take 
on HIV and he does not believe that HIV 

714
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:18,180
causes AIDS.
He thinks that HIV is evidence of a weak

715
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:19,014
immune system.

716
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:26,210
Excuse me.
And he thinks that when people have HIV,

717
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,490
it's because their immune system is 
compromised.

718
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,430
It's not that HIV compromises their 
immune system.

719
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,060
Oh,
okay.

720
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,930
And he feels like all these people that 
are catching aids and getting,

721
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,860
uh,
HIV,

722
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,400
what's happening is they're doing a lot 
of party drugs,

723
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:42,130
they're doing emile and crystal

724
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,760
meth and that's very,
very prevalent inside the gay community,

725
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,010
you know,
gay guys party a ton,

726
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,990
right?
And they're,

727
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,833
they're doing a lot of drugs and he 
points to the high correlation between 

728
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,560
all these people doing these party drugs
and HIV.

729
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,753
His work is widely criticized amongst 
legitimate scientists and most people 

730
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:04,330
just do not agree with him.
And they said that the,

731
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:05,164
um,
the connection between HIV and AIDS is 

732
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,310
rock solid and undeniable.
But he thinks it's not in.

733
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,600
It's an boy.
Did people get mad at me about that one?

734
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,443
I'm,
I'm just talking to this guy who's a 

735
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,740
biologist at the University of 
California,

736
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:18,311
Berkeley.
I mean,

737
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:23,311
I'm figuring this guy's legit scientist,
but he can't get funding for anything.

738
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:26,020
He's essentially blackballed from the 
academic community.

739
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,220
And it was really weird talking to them.
It's like,

740
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,850
has anybody debated you?
And he's like,

741
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:31,990
no,
no one will debate me.

742
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,051
You know,
is it,

743
00:30:33,051 --> 00:30:34,500
is it almost like,
um,

744
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,823
what about Arthur Ashe?
Or is he saying that a direct injection 

745
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,100
into the bloodstream will give it to 
you?

746
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:40,480
How does he explain those?
Well,

747
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,213
I don't know what Arthur Ashe was doing,
but what he was saying essentially was 

748
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:45,430
that transfusion.
I think you got it.

749
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,880
One of the things about HIV was if you 
got HIV,

750
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,550
Arthur Ashe got a transfusion.
For what reason though?

751
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,570
Oh,
I don't know.

752
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,180
I'm not your thing.
He had something wrong.

753
00:30:55,181 --> 00:30:56,014
Right?
When what he's saying is that when your 

754
00:30:57,971 --> 00:31:01,420
immune system is compromised,
that's when HIV shows itself that HIV is

755
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:02,254
a very weak virus and that it only shows
up in the immune systems of people that 

756
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:06,514
are compromised and that.
Is he saying we all have it or you can 

757
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:11,831
catch it like,
no,

758
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:14,620
he's not saying we all have it,
but you saying you can catch it,

759
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:15,454
but he's saying the evidence of it is 
only in people that have a weakened 

760
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:20,560
immune system.

761
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,270
Again,
I'm just not something I believe in.

762
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,130
Gentlemen.
Don't get mad at me because I'm white or

763
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,100
you know,
there's so many.

764
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:29,710
I think there's a million different 
cases of people who obviously were,

765
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,873
you know,
who got it in in very weird ways are 

766
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:34,480
again,
two blood transfusions or they were born

767
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:35,320
with it.
But here it says,

768
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:38,380
Arthur ash says he believed he 
contracted HIV,

769
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,873
the virus that causes AIDS through a 
transfusion of tainted blood during his 

770
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:46,120
second round of heart bypass surgery in 
1983.

771
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:47,763
First learned of his inspection.
Now here's the other issue that I'm 

772
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,183
Peter Duesberg was saying was that what 
they were giving people when they first 

773
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:55,324
tested positive for HIV was act.
That act is a medication they used to 

774
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:01,474
use for chemotherapy,
but they stopped using it for 

775
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:03,934
chemotherapy because it was killing 
people quicker than cancer was killing 

776
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:07,630
people.
I mean,

777
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:08,464
it was just a brutal,
brutal drug and they had a bunch of it 

778
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,010
in his mind.

779
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,023
They had a bunch of it laying around 
after that and they decided to try to 

780
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:18,600
use it on aids patients and they started
reading re,

781
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:19,260
uh,
in,

782
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,470
you know,
reintroducing it and you wonder.

783
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,020
I guess the conspiracy thing is I take 
pharmaceuticals.

784
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:24,854
We had all these drugs and they wanted 
to get rid of unneeded or do they think 

785
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:27,874
that hey,
they were just trying to do something 

786
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:30,070
else.
I mean,

787
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:33,100
obviously it wasn't the smart thing to 
do because they don't use it anymore and

788
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:36,250
it didn't help people act did not help 
people with aids.

789
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,530
I mean,
people who took azt died,

790
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,270
lot of them,
shitload

791
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,760
of them and aids back then was 
essentially a death sentence,

792
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,863
but there was a lot of people that 
didn't do anything that got aids that 

793
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:49,700
got HIV.
It never got aids.

794
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:50,563
They just took care of their body and it
took a holistic approach and using 

795
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:54,290
nutrition.
And I,

796
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,870
I just think it's super controversial,
like anything else.

797
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,890
I mean there's people that get cancer 
and don't die.

798
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,540
They get cured of it.
Sure.

799
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,680
But then there's people that get cancer 
at ravages are system and kills them.

800
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,790
So Steve Jobs,
I mean,

801
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:05,624
he listened to people.
I think he didn't try like alternative 

802
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,930
met Steve Jobs should still be alive.
He had,

803
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:10,850
like they said,
a pretty curable form of cancer.

804
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,530
You can get pancreatic.
Uh,

805
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:13,131
no.
I thought he,

806
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:16,460
I thought his was,
they said a fairly curable one,

807
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,240
that he had listened to his friends and 
tried to go so holistic and they said if

808
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:23,510
he had gone and just had it treated,
he probably would've survived it.

809
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,643
Well,
those was probably a lot of that going 

810
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:26,384
on.
There's always a lot of fucking wacky 

811
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:30,110
people with their wacky ideas about 
holistic medicine.

812
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,003
Did.
I saw a guy do a ted talk on basically 

813
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:33,614
saying like strawberries are really good
because they caused other anti 

814
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:40,040
angiogenesis or something,
which is about.

815
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,810
It stops the production of new blood 
vessels and that's what feeds cancer.

816
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:45,644
Like he had this.
He literally had me convinced you could 

817
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:48,890
eat fucking strawberries and I kicked 
cancer in large quantities.

818
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,890
So I mean if you hear somebody talk who 
really knows what they're talking about,

819
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:54,830
even if they're wrong,
a lot of people are convinced by.

820
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:56,810
Well that's one of the problems with 
like youtube videos,

821
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:57,644
right?
Where people have wacky conspiracy 

822
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,204
theories as long as they speak with big 
words and I say things in complete 

823
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:05,510
sentences and they sound articulate.
You start to believe them.

824
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,180
Don't.
The one thing that has been proven to be

825
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:13,070
effective with cancer,
some forms of cancer is ketogenic diets.

826
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,143
Diets where your fat based,
where you eat a lot of Avocados and 

827
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:17,144
coconut oil and your body Burns those 
rather than glucose and some cancers 

828
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,540
feed off sugar,
so to starve them,

829
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,643
you go on a very low sugar diet and a 
very high fat diet and apparently 

830
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:36,230
there's real science that shows that 
there's some benefits to that,

831
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,790
but so there's only certain kinds of 
cancers,

832
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,740
certain kinds of cancers.
It doesn't affect at all.

833
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:41,760
Certain kinds of brain cancers.
It doesn't affect it all.

834
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,970
It doesn't matter what the fuck you do.
You better go to a doctor.

835
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,650
Yeah,
I mean he can do both.

836
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,870
We want it to go to the doctor and try 
some of that,

837
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:49,700
like having another coddling under the 
fucking hospital.

838
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,340
You have to choose what we about to say.

839
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,173
Jamie,
what I just googled on the Steve Jobs 

840
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:55,694
thing is like both of you are actually 
correct from what I just found that he 

841
00:34:58,191 --> 00:34:59,024
had pancreatic cancer,
but he also could have been saved 

842
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:03,740
potentially,
but then the next thing also says that,

843
00:35:03,741 --> 00:35:05,150
uh,
he lived for 20 years with it.

844
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:06,180
So,
uh,

845
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,390
he didn't have chemo or radiation.
They,

846
00:35:08,391 --> 00:35:09,224
uh,
swayze a pancreatic and died within 18 

847
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:11,360
months.
Oh,

848
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,460
they're saying that the,
the,

849
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:12,990
the,
uh,

850
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:13,823
the,
the treatment killed him or are there 

851
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:18,470
different kinds of pancreatic cancers?
Stupid.

852
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,313
Lately it isn't there.
There's a Hodgkin's and non Hodgkin's 

853
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:22,214
lymphoma one is worse than the other,
but that bag up please Jesus Christ and 

854
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,210
said,
Steve Lived for 20 years of this cancer.

855
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,540
It seems he did not have chemotherapy or
radiation treatment at all.

856
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,270
The Hollywood actors who's at answering 
this?

857
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:37,710
This is what is this,
this bullshit?

858
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,370
See,
by the way out,

859
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,530
go up there right there.

860
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,970
Walter Isaacson,
he's writing the Steve Jobs biography.

861
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,163
He told 60 minutes that Steve refused 
what could have been potentially a 

862
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:48,900
lifesaving surgery,
but he did have more than one surgery,

863
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:51,330
right?
Didn't he have his liver replaced?

864
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,410
Whereas I feel like he had a liver 
transplant.

865
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,290
What is it that makes a guy not want to 
surgery?

866
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:01,560
That might work,
like do people become delusional in that

867
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:03,510
they're that or are they afraid of the 
surgery?

868
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:04,344
Are they willing to die?
Like fucking Zappa hated going to the 

869
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:09,150
doctor and he died lose he 56.
What was wrong with Zappa when he.

870
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,540
It was a cancer I want.
I was just calling cancer or prostate.

871
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,553
The surgeon who gave Steve jobs a new 
liver and two more years faces new 

872
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:19,170
questions.
That's a 2013.

873
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,480
What does it say?
It says he bought the Memphis House with

874
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,140
job convalesced.
What?

875
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,800
He later bought the Memphis House.
He bought the house where Steve Jobs was

876
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:32,230
living there.

877
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,063
They said the guy who was treating 
George Harrison board on guitar to sign 

878
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,160
while he was in the fucking hospital.
Sign this real quick.

879
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

880
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,240
Revelation came with the end of the 
southern transplant Mark Buba Bulls.

881
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:46,420
Say that name.
Peruse squeak per,

882
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,280
per uh,
weight a rescue pressq ,

883
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,770
a Poreska Presca front page story.
Rewey R,

884
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,690
r u,
S Q,

885
00:36:57,691 --> 00:37:02,691
u I n a front page story Thursday in the
Memphis commercial advocate piece paints

886
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:07,860
a vivid picture of the life saving 
operation,

887
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:08,694
although it takes most of the details 
about jobs from the Walter Isaacson 

888
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:12,600
biography and blah,
blah,

889
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:12,961
blah,
blah,

890
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:13,790
blah.
So why,

891
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,623
what is the question?
How did jobs move to the top of the 

892
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:16,741
list?
Oh,

893
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:17,574
it's one of those things.
It's like Frank Underwood and the 

894
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,500
fucking.
Yeah,

895
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,990
why don't we probably paid somebody.
Jesus,

896
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:24,800
how the fuck do you think he gets to the
top of the list when you have $50,

897
00:37:24,801 --> 00:37:27,990
million dollars you can move around yet 
when the way you are emailing is because

898
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:30,450
of something you've invented,
you'd probably get to the fucking top of

899
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:32,660
the list.
Fast wonder what killed his liver.

900
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:35,520
I wonder if it was medication,
like medication for.

901
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,533
I know a friend who just died from 
pancreatic cancer and he had it for 

902
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,660
quite a few years.
I met him.

903
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:48,780
I met him in 2014 and he already had it 
and he just died.

904
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,420
It says he uh,
refused.

905
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,473
Tim Cook's liver transplant offer 
because he has the same rare blood type 

906
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:55,861
of Sim.
Wow.

907
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:56,694
Whoa.
Tim Cook would have given Steve Jobs or 

908
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,303
a chunk of liver boy.
That's tense than anyone's ever taken 

909
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:03,340
over the company.
Hey,

910
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,431
whoa.
Yeah.

911
00:38:04,431 --> 00:38:06,420
What are you must have been?
Yeah.

912
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,830
If you want to give you a moisture 
liver,

913
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,110
I wouldn't get my boss a hat.
Yeah.

914
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,000
Could you.
I guess the.

915
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,740
Obviously they were good friends.
Can you imagine?

916
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,870
That's intense,
man.

917
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:15,763
Your liver is something that regenerates
hospital where jobs received transplant 

918
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:21,030
was given $40,000,000
by him.

919
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,900
Wow.
That's how you do it.

920
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,010
Yeah.
I guess he was appreciated.

921
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,213
Let's look.
That's how you get to the front of the 

922
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:26,820
line.
What do you think the lines are supposed

923
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:27,870
to be?
Fair.

924
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:28,530
You fucks.

925
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,400
This is a way to cut 40 million,
40 million declan cut.

926
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah.
You give some money to the hospital.

927
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:34,530
It's probably going to save a shitload 
of lives.

928
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,810
We went to before you came.
Here we are at my.

929
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,700
My radio agent died of cancer.
He was like 64,

930
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,773
65.
It was not that old and he had a cancer 

931
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:45,940
of the lymph nodes and he fucking was 
getting a little bit better,

932
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:46,774
we thought and then went for surgery for
circulation between these people in 

933
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:52,900
these super high stress jobs like 
agents.

934
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:56,890
It can because I know stress by Bob was 
not as stressed guy though,

935
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,190
unless he swallowed all that.
He was a very calm guy.

936
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:05,230
Like literally he was gentle and he gave
you bad news gently but firmly.

937
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,790
Um,
he was a very,

938
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:09,160
very unique guy.
He was not stressed and less.

939
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:11,560
He swallowed it and never showed it,
but he,

940
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,090
he seemed like a very zen guy.

941
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,670
Um,
and it was something with his,

942
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:16,504
uh,
went in for a breathing thing and just 

943
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:18,034
died.
I guess I'm definitely on the table and 

944
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:20,950
I don't have the details.
Fuck man.

945
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,150
But yeah,
he was not that old.

946
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,220
I mean it was 64 when you have.
I'm 49,

947
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:25,300
so when you just,
almost 60 foil,

948
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:26,790
that's fucking,
that's a,

949
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,380
a graspable age.
I wonder like,

950
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,393
you know,
obviously there's so many different 

951
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,930
factors that play into like the 
lifespan,

952
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,310
the difference between lifespans today.
Life Spans 100 years ago,

953
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,163
200 years ago,
and obviously there's been some big 

954
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:41,404
advances in medicine,
but I wonder like how much our diet 

955
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,160
plays on the,
the amount of cancer.

956
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,830
I mean it's kind of a huge factor.
All his sugar,

957
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,560
all the bullshit people eat all the 
preservatives,

958
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,380
smoking,
pollution.

959
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,010
They say that just living in a city can 
take up to 10 years off your life.

960
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,860
That's also probably like,
it's probably the air and it's probably,

961
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:05,590
it's probably the stress too because 
people in the city or just stressed.

962
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,170
Yeah,
I'm sure all that stuff goes into it.

963
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,063
I mean we try to avoid it,
but I try to eat healthy like grilled 

964
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,030
chicken,
but a fun one.

965
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,550
I never took into consideration until 
just a couple of years ago.

966
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,800
I read an article on the effects of 
brake dust.

967
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,323
Like when you're around a high 
population area and people constantly 

968
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:23,950
hitting their brakes.
Really?

969
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:25,570
Yeah.
When you're in traffic all the time,

970
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,390
those breaks when you,
you know,

971
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,760
you're cleaning your wheels and you get 
that break shit all over your wheels.

972
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:33,400
Sure.
That stuff's in the air.

973
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:34,923
That black sooty shit.
That shit gets in the air and if you're 

974
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:39,783
in a place like say if you're in 
Manhattan and you got like a second 

975
00:40:43,601 --> 00:40:45,700
floor,
walk up your windows open,

976
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,020
you're just taking in breakdown.

977
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,200
You're breathing that in all the time.
He'll wipe it off your fucking furniture

978
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:50,740
and shit.
You'll,

979
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,750
you'll see it on your table.
It's something that never,

980
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,613
no one ever thinks I'd be there.
Like I've never heard anyone discuss 

981
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:56,044
brake dust,
but it is something that's all over the 

982
00:40:57,011 --> 00:40:59,710
place.
Well we find dust back there jamie.

983
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,470
Like what is that dust that we keep 
finding back there?

984
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,580
It's all black.
It's probably just like La dirts because

985
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:10,540
it's dry and dusty around,
but it's black that I see it in my house

986
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,850
too,
but I mean back there,

987
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:16,490
it's weird because we have a closed 
garage door just comes in under the air.

988
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,650
We have this workout equipment and when 
we wiped the workout equipment,

989
00:41:20,651 --> 00:41:24,010
like if we go back there right now and 
put a wet paper towel to that,

990
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:26,680
a reverse hyper machine,
the top event,

991
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,750
it's all black,
like black dust.

992
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,740
Wait,
there's stuff behind that.

993
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,810
Yeah.
There's a whole warehouse back.

994
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,030
As many times I've been this room,
I thought this was the entire room.

995
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,350
I had no idea what a cool fucking 
sectional that is dead.

996
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,030
There's a room back there and there's 
another room behind it.

997
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,953
Oh,
okay.

998
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,360
Scientists find new ways of freeways are
trying to kill you.

999
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:49,250
What is it saying that the thickening 
progressing twice,

1000
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:52,700
the average in people living within 100 
meters of a freeway,

1001
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:53,534
the connection between particulate 
matter and artery thickening were 

1002
00:41:56,301 --> 00:41:58,550
statistically significant for some 
groups.

1003
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,110
Yeah.
That's what they're talking about.

1004
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,973
That's brake dust and shit that's coming
out of exhaust pipes according to La 

1005
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,733
Times.
One point 5 million people live within 

1006
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:10,190
300 meters of a freeway and the La 
Basin.

1007
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:11,024
Last year we found out the freeway 
pollution travels much further than 

1008
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:14,780
that.
As much as 2000,

1009
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:17,990
500 meters from the source.
Fuck all that,

1010
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,840
so if you're now I wonder if it's the 
same in Manhattan.

1011
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,010
I'm sure it is,
but.

1012
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,630
Or maybe because Manhattan has already 
play.

1013
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:26,240
Have a lot less cars going by your 
street and Manhattan than you do.

1014
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:28,760
They're 2,500
meters as far.

1015
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,160
How far is that in like feet or miles?

1016
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:34,700
Is that a mile?
A mile?

1017
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,020
A mile or kilometer?
That's two and a half kilometers.

1018
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:38,863
That's fucked man.
Everybody a mile from the highways 

1019
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,250
getting poisoned.
Jesus,

1020
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,200
you'll hope it,
but how old is that studying?

1021
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,570
Is it still happening as much like our.
Our break,

1022
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:50,330
our breaks made me better now than they 
were a few years ago.

1023
00:42:50,331 --> 00:42:51,170
That's the same thing.
No,

1024
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,080
the same thing.
Those 2010 breaks at the same.

1025
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,390
I mean there,
there's no different.

1026
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:55,930
They,
they're,

1027
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,880
they're the same fucking things.
They've always had these pads.

1028
00:42:58,881 --> 00:43:00,170
They press down,
they were out.

1029
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:02,720
You got to replace them and when they're
wearing out there grinding down,

1030
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:04,520
that powder isn't going anywhere.
Right?

1031
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,450
Someone should probably figure out a way
how to contain that mean.

1032
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:11,360
That seems like what we're doing now is 
it just,

1033
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,060
it just goes out into the atmosphere.
Maybe they should be contained,

1034
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,740
like where the powder,
the brakes would work the same way,

1035
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,353
but the powder would have to be like 
sucked up into some sort of a pouch or 

1036
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:25,490
something and you have to change it like
a filter.

1037
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,740
How often would you have to change it?
Probably all the time,

1038
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,360
but that seems like that would be like a
real viable alternative,

1039
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:35,750
like some sort of encased break thing.
You know what I mean?

1040
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:37,940
That doesn't seem like outside of the 
realm of engineering,

1041
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,120
what can they make the breaks,
if that sounds unfeasible,

1042
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,163
can they make the breaks out of 
something that's actually just not as 

1043
00:43:44,061 --> 00:43:46,160
bad for you?
Is there anything they can do that might

1044
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:48,380
be a little bit of a fix,
but I think anything you breathe in,

1045
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:50,210
you breathe in Sawdust and sucks for 
you.

1046
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,453
It's a particulate matter like you're 
taking in things and you're taking a 

1047
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,170
certain kind of dust into your lungs and
it becomes an irritant,

1048
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,590
so it's not good.
Not good,

1049
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:01,840
Jamie.
Wow.

1050
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,243
A sad,
sad for all those people that live near 

1051
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:05,400
the highway.
Well,

1052
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,820
they live near the highway and I have my
lifestyle,

1053
00:44:07,821 --> 00:44:08,654
so I guess we're all going to fucking 
dropped that a little earlier than we 

1054
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:10,820
showed this.

1055
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,290
And you don't have HIV.
No.

1056
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,200
Keep a rubber on.
You're going to be fine.

1057
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,390
Don't anybody come in your butt and 
everything's gonna be okay.

1058
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:20,360
It's just fucking what a party killer.
I know I've got a lot of rules,

1059
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,770
but no condoms.
No,

1060
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:23,130
I can't wear them.
Oh,

1061
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,220
well that's going to be a problem.
It's definitely a problem.

1062
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,233
My fucking Dick shrivels.
How many guys have gotten aids from 

1063
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,740
regular sex though?
Probably very few.

1064
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,820
Very few probably,
but should have it.

1065
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:33,803
I'm sure.
I'm sure it's somehow physically 

1066
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:35,874
possible,
but you probably have to have so many 

1067
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:42,150
things lined up to get it from fucking 
pussy or even fucking ass.

1068
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,390
You have to have so many things.
I'm sure it can happen though.

1069
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,000
Yeah,
well it's.

1070
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,720
It's the issue is it has to get into 
your body,

1071
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,853
but I know that people get sick all the 
time from having a cut and then I'm 

1072
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,493
getting someone's blood in their cuts,
like that's happened to people in 

1073
00:44:57,991 --> 00:44:58,824
hospitals that have done surgery and cut
their finger while they're doing it and 

1074
00:45:02,191 --> 00:45:04,290
they get infected by the blood of 
someone else.

1075
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,710
That's common.
Right.

1076
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,360
So it's got a little cut on your Dick.
I remember when I had that thought,

1077
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:11,280
I've told the story of Hbo Special.
I had three similar Ron Jeremy after the

1078
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:12,500
porn awards.
It was,

1079
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:12,760
yeah.
Was.

1080
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,050
It was fun.
It didn't feel necessarily sexy,

1081
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:17,350
but it was fun.
Yeah,

1082
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,690
it was just.
Yeah,

1083
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,591
it was a Goof,
you know,

1084
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:22,320
it's like a girl and he's fucking her.
So he went into the bathroom.

1085
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,150
He was fucking one girl and he fucked 
another one and he,

1086
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:27,130
I remember he put rubbing alcohol around
his dick and I don't know if that's that

1087
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:28,590
good for you,
but I think he was doing to make sure he

1088
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:29,424
didn't have a cut,
but he only did that before he fucked 

1089
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,230
her.
I think.

1090
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,810
I think alcohol or something.
Yeah,

1091
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,160
to make sure that it was cleaning the 
window.

1092
00:45:35,161 --> 00:45:36,800
Cut set is so hard core.

1093
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,130
It is.
But you know,

1094
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:38,964
his Dick has probably seen a lot of 
action and it might be a way to keep 

1095
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:41,430
things off it.
Yeah.

1096
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,100
If that guy doesn't have aids,
who the fuck is getting aids?

1097
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,010
You know about that.
You're not lucky.

1098
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:48,800
I'm a lucky guy.
Lucky.

1099
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,250
Terrible now.
Yeah.

1100
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,160
I mean think about that.
If that guy doesn't have aids,

1101
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,150
fuck yeah.
I mean I do realize I've rolled the dice

1102
00:45:57,151 --> 00:46:00,210
way too many times and I'm like,
I'm lucky that I'm really grateful.

1103
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,250
Like a fuck man.
You just stop.

1104
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,880
Well it's also your uh,
you know,

1105
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:06,873
it's just think it's harder to get like 
for a man than it is for a woman it 

1106
00:46:11,971 --> 00:46:14,010
seems like unless again,
you let somebody come in here,

1107
00:46:14,011 --> 00:46:15,490
but yeah,
that can be harder.

1108
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,470
I think it's harder to get,
but he didn't know.

1109
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,280
What am I at Dr.

1110
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,920
No,
but you're right.

1111
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,753
I think it is hard.
It's hard to go fuck without a rubber 

1112
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:24,150
right now because Rogan.
Tessa.

1113
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,650
No,
but I think you're right.

1114
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:26,484
It probably is harder to get unless you 
have a cut on your Dick and she's 

1115
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:31,140
cutting her pussy and they happen to 
just go air tight against each other.

1116
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:31,561
I mean,
come on.

1117
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:33,450
Yeah.
For a woman like you gotta,

1118
00:46:33,451 --> 00:46:36,000
think like all there,
everything's exposed,

1119
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:39,850
right?
All that area inside their vagina is all

1120
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,340
open tissue.
Right.

1121
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,020
It's all like absorbing like they have 
the worst situation set up,

1122
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,913
but I think the air.
I was told years ago by a woman who 

1123
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:50,590
worked in the health field that it's 
such a.

1124
00:46:50,591 --> 00:46:53,490
it's such a delicate virus that if you 
like,

1125
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,500
she's like a blow job.
You won't even get it from.

1126
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:56,410
She's like,
because you're,

1127
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,230
your stomach kills the semen.
She's like,

1128
00:46:58,231 --> 00:46:58,370
you.

1129
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:01,380
You can even give him a blow job.
Which I don't know how true that is,

1130
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:03,660
but she called me that fucking.
She lives in Elkton,

1131
00:47:03,661 --> 00:47:06,030
Maryland.
I remember she was a really cute girl.

1132
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:06,864
I met at a road gig.
I remember the fucking town she lived 

1133
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:09,750
in.
She was telling you this before.

1134
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:12,040
She blew you and don't worry about it.
Yeah,

1135
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:13,950
don't worry about it.
Stomach acid.

1136
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:16,250
Swatch glow.
Yeah,

1137
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,630
she was really,
she was a wonderful health practitioner.

1138
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:20,464
She's fucking drink about a gallon of 
seeds and tell me we're all going to be 

1139
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:24,660
fine.
Elkton Maryland.

1140
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:25,643
Good girl.
Isn't it crazy though that so many 

1141
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:30,400
diseases kill people from sex?
You mean syphilis,

1142
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,010
gonorrhea,
those are those fatal without,

1143
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,023
you know,
like that's isn't syphilis would killed 

1144
00:47:35,651 --> 00:47:37,280
Al Capone?
Um,

1145
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,260
I think so.
Yeah.

1146
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:39,094
I believe we even did,
but in the twenties there was nothing 

1147
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:40,880
they could do for.

1148
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,590
Right,
right.

1149
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:42,520
Yeah.
But I mean,

1150
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:45,840
it's just amazing that untreated so many
diseases turned me.

1151
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:50,560
Think about how few things other than 
like severely compromised immune systems

1152
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:52,770
that get hit by the flu.
You know,

1153
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,613
the people that die from the flu,
usually it's old people or young really 

1154
00:47:56,531 --> 00:48:00,430
young people that are kind of frail.
They wind up getting sick and dying from

1155
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,140
common colds and things along those 
lines.

1156
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:02,974
But most people they get better from it.
Can you imagine shooting cancer out of 

1157
00:48:05,681 --> 00:48:07,480
your Dick?
If for that was like fucking a,

1158
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:10,330
that would be like,
that's where we have a problem.

1159
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:11,164
If you could,
if you could give somebody cancer 

1160
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,323
sexually,
and I know they say oral sex and throat 

1161
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:16,420
cancers possible,
well HPV,

1162
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,033
human papilloma virus can give some 
women ovarian cancer or you can get it 

1163
00:48:21,611 --> 00:48:23,290
in your throat if they have it from 
eating pussy.

1164
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,273
Well,
isn't that what the Michael Douglas 

1165
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:25,834
thing was?
They said that fucking Catherine Zeta 

1166
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,100
Jones put the Kibosh on that rubber.
She was like not true.

1167
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,750
Plus we're getting a divorce.
Oh yeah,

1168
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:32,840
man.
She must have been when he was.

1169
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,873
He went out and started talking about 
that and they're like looking at her 

1170
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:37,030
pussy.
That must have been so annoying.

1171
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,270
You know Michael Throat cancer and oral 
sex photo of him.

1172
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,163
If I get.
If you google throat cancer and oral 

1173
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:44,170
sex,
Michael Douglas comes up.

1174
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,480
That's got to be a bummer.
Yeah,

1175
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:48,280
so he could probably should have kept 
his mouth shut about that,

1176
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,230
but she did.
She was like,

1177
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,960
it.
Correct me if I'm wrong,

1178
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:55,720
but wasn't she suffering from some 
serious mental illness,

1179
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:58,600
like some,
some ruthless bipolar type shit?

1180
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:59,330
No,
I don't know.

1181
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,163
Yeah,
I think Catherine Zeta Jones is pretty 

1182
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:05,230
open about mental illness.
I didn't know she was.

1183
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,650
It's not surprising that somebody that 
hot like there's always a price to pay.

1184
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:09,970
Yeah,
there's always,

1185
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:11,680
you know,
you date someone that beautiful that her

1186
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:16,681
now her private struggle struggle.
Catherine Zeta Jones bipolar disorder.

1187
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,333
Well,
you know it's true because it's in 

1188
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,290
people celebrity.
Yeah.

1189
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:21,930
They always get to the bottom of post.
Yeah,

1190
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,290
she's too hot.
That's the problem.

1191
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:25,420
Nature just gives her a fucking curve 
ball.

1192
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,333
Know you want to be hot.
How bout a little crazy to be this 

1193
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,513
beautiful and you're gonna.
Want to hang yourself during a second 

1194
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:32,930
commercial.
Here you go.

1195
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,210
Fucking get this.
She says,

1196
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:35,044
I torture.
My husband had a tough few years from 

1197
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:40,210
her husband's cancer to and public 
battled bipolar disorder.

1198
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,640
Now the Hollywood stars back with a new 
film and film.

1199
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:43,563
Not,
not really new article because she's 

1200
00:49:45,821 --> 00:49:47,350
kind of vanished off the face of the 
map.

1201
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,480
Yeah.
You gotta wonder like when people.

1202
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,610
There's.
I was looking at some pictures the other

1203
00:49:51,611 --> 00:49:52,444
day of a,
some movie star that I forgot who his 

1204
00:49:55,181 --> 00:49:58,090
name was,
but he was in a ton of movies and that.

1205
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:58,983
Oh,
the guy that was in platoon with scars 

1206
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:01,750
all over his face.
Tom Berenger,

1207
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,820
Tom Berenger,
and then just finished.

1208
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,890
You know what he kinda did man,
and I don't know why he did a couple.

1209
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:07,763
We have been a school teacher.
There's nothing worse than the white 

1210
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,860
school teacher in the black school.
We get it.

1211
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:13,263
We get at.
You're rescuing them fucking Hollywood 

1212
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,093
assholes.
Michelle pfeiffer and how great was she 

1213
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:19,414
in dangerous minds mentally?
Gangster's paradise was the theme song 

1214
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,460
and she was going to go in there and 
with that bad accent and she was.

1215
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,350
It was funny.
She was.

1216
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:27,990
This is why

1217
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,823
people feeling like their music was 
getting lame where I think it was Bob 

1218
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:34,100
Dylan lyrics she was teaching the young 
roughy ins with.

1219
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,440
That's like desperate white people 
wanting to go like,

1220
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:37,101
look,
black guys.

1221
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:39,010
Our stuff's cool,
and they read the lyrics.

1222
00:50:39,011 --> 00:50:39,860
I'm like,
Oh shit.

1223
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:44,580
These are troubled times.
You don't fucking luck.

1224
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,610
That was strong as I could be.
That's what it is.

1225
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,030
They can.
We check that.

1226
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,730
If it was a bucket,
Dylan's over.

1227
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,090
Shoot a homeboy.
Oh my God.

1228
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:58,700
She wrote that down on.
Who should you shoot,

1229
00:50:58,701 --> 00:51:00,310
Catherine?
Her fucking handle.

1230
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,150
She looks like Gilbert grape with that 
heritage.

1231
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,620
She was really hot,
but not in that one.

1232
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,513
Yeah,
and she had a leather jacket on the 

1233
00:51:05,181 --> 00:51:07,420
show.
She was hard for even indoors.

1234
00:51:07,421 --> 00:51:09,120
Who wears a leather jacket?
She was not.

1235
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,780
Her accent was not good gangster.
What was the accent?

1236
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,830
It was southern,
but it kind of went back and forth.

1237
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:16,440
Know she was from Tennessee or fucking 
word Boston.

1238
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,150
When they keep.
I think they make a decision one day.

1239
00:51:20,151 --> 00:51:23,000
The first day of shooting is 40 minutes 
into the film,

1240
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,790
Forty minutes off you go deep into the 
movie.

1241
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,850
That's the first day of shooting and 
then they start somewhere else.

1242
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:29,684
They changed the accident and it just 
changes by the time they get the 40 

1243
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:33,710
minutes in the elevator picture of her 
with coolio.

1244
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,390
Coolio.
One fear factor.

1245
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,383
Did he really?
Yeah,

1246
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,270
and he was so high.
I mean so high.

1247
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:45,104
I would open up his trailer door and 
just get a fucking ferocious contact 

1248
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:50,450
high just from opening the door.
I was like,

1249
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,570
what?
I A Canadian guy.

1250
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:54,221
Well,
I don't.

1251
00:51:54,221 --> 00:51:55,011
I don't know.
I did.

1252
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,780
What you would call it,
Mark Marin had a show called,

1253
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:57,614
nevermind the buzzcocks and one of the 
guests on there was coolio when I did 

1254
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,790
with Monday wonder Mike from the 
sugarhill gang.

1255
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:04,120
Coolio.
Nevermind the buzzcocks might.

1256
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:04,761
Yeah,
Mark Marin.

1257
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:05,594
It was a British show and Mark Marin 
hosted it here in late 2000 and he was 

1258
00:52:08,901 --> 00:52:11,200
one of the guests that uh,
and he,

1259
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,093
he loved me.
We had so much fun and I saw him years 

1260
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,810
later and he had no memory that we'd 
ever met.

1261
00:52:14,811 --> 00:52:17,070
So he did.
He loved it.

1262
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,670
He literally,
I told him he literally gotten the knees

1263
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,870
and was bowing to mix.

1264
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:23,060
I said something fucked up.
So he was just enjoying it.

1265
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,160
So I'm like,
the guy will definitely remember me,

1266
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,473
like fucking dumb slick rick.
I brought him on stage at the comedy 

1267
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:29,930
cellar one time we took a photo 
together.

1268
00:52:29,931 --> 00:52:32,720
I saw him years later in the airport,
nothing like,

1269
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:33,554
how do you not remember being on board 
on the stage from the audience if I was 

1270
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:37,670
watching a show and they brought me up 
on stage,

1271
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,570
man,
he was like,

1272
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:41,610
Dylan picture.
So a lot of those guys and meet,

1273
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:45,410
they meet so many people that they're,
they're hard drivers is constantly full.

1274
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,410
They're just constantly deleting files,
which is understandable.

1275
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:50,430
It was just the circumstances that were 
weird,

1276
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,200
like not,
not the fact that it was like me,

1277
00:52:52,201 --> 00:52:54,440
like I've interviewed people and they 
don't remember me,

1278
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:55,274
but I get that because I've done radio 
shows and I don't know who the fuck you 

1279
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:57,764
are 10 minutes later.

1280
00:52:58,430 --> 00:52:59,390
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1281
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,750
You and slick rick at the,
one of my favorite photos in history,

1282
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,030
he was in the audience and none of the 
comedians would talk to them,

1283
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:07,640
so I was going to always tell them I 
loved them and I'm like,

1284
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:09,320
I'm taking a photo with you after the 
show.

1285
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:11,030
And Manny and the owner was in there and
he goes,

1286
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,433
oh man,
he was so great and so fucking 

1287
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:15,950
ridiculous.
Did he get shot in the eye or something?

1288
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:16,933
I don't know how he's.
I believe he got shot or he did 

1289
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:20,540
something like that was in a children's 
story.

1290
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,433
Like there was something similar in his 
real life when you went to jail like 

1291
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:24,830
that,
that rapid children's.

1292
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,253
Um,

1293
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,050
but I don't know exactly how he's 
island.

1294
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,513
I thought maybe he,
I thought he had an interesting story 

1295
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:31,770
for that,
but maybe he didn't.

1296
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:37,130
I interviewed coolio before he won fear 
factor and the last 31 he was telling me

1297
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:39,810
that this is already over.
He's already done this.

1298
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:40,644
He's lived a thousand lives and a 
thousand universes and he was just so 

1299
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:45,690
barbecued.
It was like inspirational.

1300
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,940
Wow.
Was I was listening to him.

1301
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:50,880
I was like Whoa.
But because he was so high,

1302
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:53,250
like I think it just had no nerves going
in.

1303
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:56,580
He just sort of did the event.
Like it was nothing on afraid.

1304
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,680
Yeah.
Completely have some balance thing.

1305
00:53:58,681 --> 00:54:00,900
I forget what it is.
They were on some beams or some shit.

1306
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:03,720
So fucking amazing.
Nobody died doing that show.

1307
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:05,670
I look back at it sometimes and I just 
go,

1308
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,190
Ooh,
like do it again with another host.

1309
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,840
Yeah.
With a ludicrous.

1310
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,790
That's right.
Ludicrous is doing it.

1311
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:13,590
They did it once.
I don't know if they're gonna keep doing

1312
00:54:13,591 --> 00:54:14,940
it.
Apparently it was kind of a flop.

1313
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:15,923
What does it mean you don't want to?
Because when it was done it was very 

1314
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:18,984
timely,
but now with the Internet has gotten so 

1315
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:22,440
much faster and we can watch everything 
on our phone.

1316
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,080
It's kind of like you could see real 
life deaths.

1317
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:25,953
Yeah.
So it's Kinda hard to see people doing 

1318
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,223
crazy stuff when you can turn it on and 
just see someone do it without a shell 

1319
00:54:30,511 --> 00:54:31,350
around.
They just doing it.

1320
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,333
Well.
It's also the did it without the 

1321
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:36,810
original production team and the 
original production team,

1322
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:37,380
they,
they,

1323
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,190
they cut the budget substantially so it 
looked kind of cheap.

1324
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,890
And then the Stents,
warren is dangerous.

1325
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:46,080
Like the original production team,
they were wizards.

1326
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:46,913
I mean they were really good at that 
kind of show and they did 148 episodes 

1327
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:53,790
of the first season and then we came 
back.

1328
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,220
We did six more.
So there was a.

1329
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:59,940
I mean they had just massive amounts of 
experience and putting together like the

1330
00:54:59,941 --> 00:55:03,210
stunt people,
the stunt people,

1331
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,770
beast on.
It's where all the gross things,

1332
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,873
like all that stuff was.
I think they didn't do any gross stuff 

1333
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:10,740
this time around.
The lawyers got involved.

1334
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,040
They probably now is corporate.
The lawyers will quietly,

1335
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:14,383
you know,
and then they were like worried about 

1336
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:17,100
lawsuits in no matter what you signed,
they're still going to do.

1337
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,133
So the lawyer probably chopped lot lie 
that shit out or they couldn't get 

1338
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,910
insurance.
Well with NBC,

1339
00:55:20,911 --> 00:55:24,450
the second interrail iteration of fear 
factor and be like,

1340
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,640
what was it,
like 2012 or something like that.

1341
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:27,474
And we did it again.

1342
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,810
Two Thousand Eleven,
2012 when we did it again.

1343
00:55:30,811 --> 00:55:32,790
They were often,
I think it was 11.

1344
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:34,890
They did it.
It was off the deep end.

1345
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:37,220
Scary.
Like they went way too far.

1346
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,520
Yeah,
it was dangerous.

1347
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:41,190
I thought it was dangerous.
Like some of the stuff they were doing,

1348
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:45,210
we're like so much more intense than the
stuff that we'd done before.

1349
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:46,380
I'm like,
this is fucking.

1350
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:48,390
We could.
Someone could get hurt here.

1351
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:52,330
Did you not want to do it after that?
A second season of the new iteration.

1352
00:55:52,331 --> 00:55:53,370
And you said when do it?
Well,

1353
00:55:53,371 --> 00:55:54,930
they canceled it because people had a 
drink.

1354
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:55,764
Come.
Why that should have automatically got 

1355
00:55:58,131 --> 00:56:01,470
to the second season.
That's what got to cancel.

1356
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,320
They play.
They played horseshoes for donkey come.

1357
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:05,783
Yeah.
They were throwing horseshoes and in no 

1358
00:56:07,651 --> 00:56:08,484
matter what you had to drink.
Some come like if you landed a perfect 

1359
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:13,410
ring toss and then you only had a drink 
that a couple of ounces.

1360
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,453
But these drinks,
these dudes were drinking beer steins 

1361
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:18,510
have come.
Wow.

1362
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,280
Why they can't with his complaints or 
the network go.

1363
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,160
They went too far.
I'm TMZ got

1364
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:29,160
ahold of footage and they put an NBC 
passed on.

1365
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,630
I mean they,
they,

1366
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:33,760
they passed.
They said okay to all these guns.

1367
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:34,900
Right.
So they,

1368
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,793
they,
they cleared all of the ridiculous 

1369
00:56:37,691 --> 00:56:40,930
stunts that they wanted to do and this 
was the most ridiculous.

1370
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:43,570
Like getting people to drink,
come on television.

1371
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:44,404
Yeah,
that's rough.

1372
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,250
Well,
it was just like,

1373
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,083
it's so over the top and that's the idea
was that they couldn't have fear factor 

1374
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:50,650
the way they used to have it before they
had to be.

1375
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,570
It had to be bigger,
badder,

1376
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:57,190
crazier a fear factor.
And so the second version of it was just

1377
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,430
completely over the top,
a little too much and they pushed it too

1378
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:01,690
far and too gross people out.
Yeah.

1379
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:05,590
They drank donkey pis and donkey come 
and it was twins.

1380
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,750
So one twin had a drink.
The Pis,

1381
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:12,520
she's drinking piss and the other girls 
drink come.

1382
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,580
Wow.
Mug a Mug of coffee.

1383
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,440
Oh my God,
what a great girlfriend.

1384
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:19,240
She must be though.
Fucking ace.

1385
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,103
You know what's interesting?
A lot of the girls wanted a drink to 

1386
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:25,650
come rather than drink the pice.
Of course they have experienced with it.

1387
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:25,941
They,
they,

1388
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:27,900
the pisses a grocer thing come.
They're like,

1389
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:28,360
all right,
come.

1390
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,970
It's not great,
but I've drank it and that guy drank.

1391
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:32,290
Come and look at it.
They're hugging.

1392
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:33,340
They've got on their shirts.

1393
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:36,220
It was deep,
man.

1394
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,193
There's only been two times ever in the 
history of the show where I said to the 

1395
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:41,434
producers,
Hey,

1396
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:44,230
don't don't do this.
And that was one of them.

1397
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:45,420
You said they shouldn't do it.
I said,

1398
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,990
it's too much.
It's just too crazy.

1399
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,520
Oh my God.
That's a lot of calm.

1400
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,660
The shot.
Come look at her,

1401
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,330
chugging it down.
Oh my God,

1402
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:55,210
Amanda and chugging a town with me.
My fucking stupid big head hovering over

1403
00:57:55,211 --> 00:57:57,880
you telling you to do.
You were encouraging her to do anything.

1404
00:57:58,610 --> 00:57:59,930
It's like,
you know,

1405
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,540
I mean I wanted her to win.
I wanted,

1406
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:05,050
I wanted them all to win.
It's part of the problem with doing that

1407
00:58:05,051 --> 00:58:06,400
show.
You liked them?

1408
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,031
Well,
yeah.

1409
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:09,020
I mean hopefully you wanted people to,
to,

1410
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:10,043
you know,
I was like a coach or a motivational 

1411
00:58:13,091 --> 00:58:15,640
speaker as much as I was telling him you
can do it.

1412
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,740
Why did you get in their head?
And you just tell them like,

1413
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:18,574
look,
you just put one foot in front of the 

1414
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:23,110
other and just don't,
don't entertain any thoughts of quitting

1415
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,110
because a lot of quitting is just in 
your mind.

1416
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:27,910
A lot of quitting is just your mind 
saying,

1417
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:28,631
man,
we can't do this,

1418
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:29,620
man.
We should find a way out,

1419
00:58:29,621 --> 00:58:30,221
man.
Fuck this.

1420
00:58:30,221 --> 00:58:31,054
This is just too uncomfortable.
Whereas if you can just force yourself 

1421
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,360
to push those aside and don't entertain 
those thoughts at all,

1422
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,640
you can get through a lot of things.
You can't get through.

1423
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

1424
00:58:40,721 --> 00:58:42,300
That's the hard part is when you start 
telling us.

1425
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,353
It's almost when people push themselves.
I remember Matt Serra was actually 

1426
00:58:44,831 --> 00:58:45,664
talking about Ray Longo and the way 
he'll push you past what you think you 

1427
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:50,530
can go,
but my problem is I'll stop,

1428
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:51,364
but I think I have to stop,
but I guess there is this stuff in the 

1429
00:58:53,111 --> 00:58:53,944
reserve tank,
but it just feels like there's nothing 

1430
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:57,220
there,
but it's a mind set.

1431
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:02,310
It's like if you get your mind 
accustomed to convincing your body,

1432
00:59:02,411 --> 00:59:06,520
the enough is enough and then you start 
entertaining those thoughts and thinking

1433
00:59:06,521 --> 00:59:10,240
of those thoughts more than thinking 
about concentrating on the task at hand.

1434
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,620
You start thinking about,
boy,

1435
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,633
if I just quit now,
I can quit all this uncomfortable 

1436
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:16,054
feeling will stop all this.
A heaving of my breath or burning of my 

1437
00:59:19,451 --> 00:59:21,160
legs or whatever it is that you're 
doing.

1438
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,930
That can all stop.
All the nervousness can stop.

1439
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:27,590
Like you see a lot of times before 
fights.

1440
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:28,703
Um,
we've had several instances over the 

1441
00:59:30,111 --> 00:59:33,140
course of the history of the UFC.
Most of the time it doesn't happen,

1442
00:59:33,141 --> 00:59:33,974
but several incidents where people get 
anxiety attacks and you could attribute 

1443
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:39,260
that to a lot of different things,
right?

1444
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:40,071
You could say,
well,

1445
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:43,280
some people just have anxiety and well,
what is an anxiety attack?

1446
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,770
Well,
some people believe that a lot of what's

1447
00:59:45,771 --> 00:59:46,604
happening is the mindset that you're 
entering into a fight with and that 

1448
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:56,260
you're allowing your mind to just sort 
of run rampant rather than corralling it

1449
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:58,963
and channeling your mind into very 
distinct pathways like very distinct 

1450
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:04,244
pathways of only beneficial thoughts and
you will vacillate and deviate from 

1451
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:08,744
those thoughts,
but always bring it back to those very 

1452
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:14,600
important thoughts and to have some sort
of a mantra like you are here to do your

1453
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:16,130
very best.
That's it.

1454
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:18,680
And all thoughts of quitting.
If your body fails on you,

1455
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,510
that's one thing,
but let it fail.

1456
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,523
Don't,
don't,

1457
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,510
don't entertain those thoughts.
Oh my God,

1458
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:24,950
now it's time to quit.
Don't quit,

1459
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,870
don't quit.
Don't entertain those thoughts.

1460
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:30,710
And there's a guy named David Goggins 
we've talked about on the podcast almost

1461
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,470
too much,
but he's a very famous endurance athlete

1462
01:00:33,471 --> 01:00:34,304
who's a,
um,

1463
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,870
things navy seal and he,
uh,

1464
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:40,760
has the world record for the most amount
of Chin ups in a day and you know,

1465
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:42,620
some insane amount.

1466
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,453
Right?
He's doing,

1467
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,293
he will do sets of five where he does 
five Chin ups and he does them over the 

1468
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:49,820
course.
It was over a thousand.

1469
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:53,870
Right.
But he does way more than it was 2000.

1470
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:54,763
Yeah.
That way it doesn't burn his arms out 

1471
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,353
and,
but how long they take taken between 

1472
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:00,470
fillon and it takes a little break,
you know,

1473
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:02,210
do five,
take a little break,

1474
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,590
relax a little,
do another five,

1475
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:06,200
take a little break,
relax a little bit back again.

1476
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,573
And he's,
he attempted it more than once because 

1477
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:11,610
one time we did it as a forum tour.
Thousand and 12.

1478
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,580
My God.
Yeah.

1479
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:14,683
So that guy,
one of his statements is most people 

1480
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:18,374
quit it 40 percent.
Most people quit at 40 percent of what 

1481
01:01:20,961 --> 01:01:22,130
they're capable of.
Really?

1482
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:23,840
Yeah.
And I think that's absolutely accurate.

1483
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:24,840
Yeah.
I,

1484
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,850
I,
um,

1485
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,110
I think about that all the time.

1486
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,480
I think about all the time when I'm on a
hard run,

1487
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:30,813
you got to know when you're running like
hills and particularly got to know when 

1488
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,600
you're just fucking exhausted and you're
running the risk of falling down and you

1489
01:01:38,601 --> 01:01:40,350
really can't breathe right?
Like you're,

1490
01:01:40,351 --> 01:01:45,020
you're really pushing it because 
particularly things like sprints or hill

1491
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:47,990
sprints,
you will reach an aerobic threshold.

1492
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,720
You'll reach a place where like,
you really can't go any further.

1493
01:01:50,721 --> 01:01:52,970
You're,
your heartbeat is 185 beats a minute.

1494
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:54,170
You can't do it.
Yeah,

1495
01:01:54,171 --> 01:01:54,800
you're,
you're,

1496
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,570
you're blowing your shit out.
I mean,

1497
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,750
you're going to fail.
But like when is it failing and when are

1498
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:00,584
you quitting?
Because there's some uncomfortable 

1499
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:04,250
moments where my heart's like 150,
a hundred 60,

1500
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:06,160
where if I was feeling like a pussy,
I'm like,

1501
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,510
let me just take a break here and 
breathe,

1502
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:10,250
you know,
which is what Bert Kreischer does.

1503
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,460
Yeah,
he probably has.

1504
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:14,390
It's a lot of.
It's mental.

1505
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,430
So you think he's just quitting?
Yeah.

1506
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:17,690
Yeah,
it's fine.

1507
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:18,523
Dot you though,
because you feel like your is telling 

1508
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:20,400
you like I'm on the treadmill,

1509
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,770
I can't do much.
Like Ah,

1510
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:23,130
exactly.
Can't do it.

1511
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,880
It's fucking boring too.
That's why I like running outside.

1512
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,003
I don't like running.
I think running on a treadmill would be 

1513
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,990
great if you had a fucking awesome movie
in front of you.

1514
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,183
Say if you were watching platoon and 
you're running on a treadmill and it's 

1515
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:36,720
right in front of you or apocalypse now 
and you're listening to it.

1516
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,490
Yeah,
I mean you can get into it,

1517
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:39,683
but I like running outside because I 
know where I'm going and it's part of 

1518
01:02:43,351 --> 01:02:44,470
the goal.
Like I,

1519
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:45,323
if I reached this peak,
that means it's a mild one point six 

1520
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:51,090
miles and then another one point six 
back.

1521
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,340
Can you run farther in real life or on a
treadmill?

1522
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:54,940
I don't run on treadmills.
Are you?

1523
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:56,110
But if you had to like,
wait,

1524
01:02:56,111 --> 01:02:57,960
which one could you do a more on a trip?

1525
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,620
You can.
Oh,

1526
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,720
for sure.
100.

1527
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,890
First of all,
the way I run,

1528
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,753
I'm running all hills.
Like I don't really run flat when I'm 

1529
01:03:05,821 --> 01:03:07,710
running flats for very short periods of 
time.

1530
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,910
It's only flat in between hills.
Uh,

1531
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,180
I fucking hate hills there.
They're terrible.

1532
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,223
But here's the thing,
I kickbox box yesterday for the first 

1533
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:19,290
time in months I hadn't done any,
any pad work,

1534
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:20,640
any bag work,
anything like that.

1535
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:23,340
And I was going through rounds,
like it was nothing.

1536
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,174
It was crazy.
Like it was so different than cardio is 

1537
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:27,413
better.
Oh my cardio's way better just from 

1538
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:32,640
running these hills because I do it.
I'm committed to doing it twice a week.

1539
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,253
I try to do it three times a week,
but I'm committed to doing it twice a 

1540
01:03:35,971 --> 01:03:37,860
week.
So I did it today and I did it Monday.

1541
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,050
How long does it take you to run the 
hills and our,

1542
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,430
my workouts and our.

1543
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:45,150
Okay.
It was fucking brutal dude at the end of

1544
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:48,780
last several pounds of water completely 
exhausted and drained.

1545
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:49,763
But when I do other stuff I have way 
more endurance and I feel great after 

1546
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:57,300
like right now,
like I'm so relaxed,

1547
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:59,640
like after that happens,
you just feel so good.

1548
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:03,990
Like you feel like,
like regular life is not as,

1549
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,890
it's just not as hard because the 
running is so difficult.

1550
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,120
I should try that.
You know,

1551
01:04:09,121 --> 01:04:11,970
I fucking hate running so much but I'm 
so bored in the gym.

1552
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,430
But you live in Manhattan,
but there's still the park.

1553
01:04:14,431 --> 01:04:15,930
I mean it's kind of,
there's this little place that you could

1554
01:04:15,931 --> 01:04:17,910
run them but you're not running,
you know,

1555
01:04:17,911 --> 01:04:19,350
you know what you should do.
I mean that's nothing.

1556
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,213
There's nothing wrong with that.
I mean running is definitely a good 

1557
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:22,644
thing as long as you're doing it the 
right way and running on the balls of 

1558
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:25,680
your feet and not on the heel and.

1559
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:28,770
But try to take in yoga.
You know,

1560
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:29,604
I like Yoga.
I like women with Yoga bodies that 

1561
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,180
fucking long,
like long lean,

1562
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:34,014
like thorax.
It's a sexy look at a walmart or acts 

1563
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,540
like they,
they just have like a,

1564
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,470
like an insect body almost.
It's long and Lincoln sex.

1565
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,760
What's that?
Are you into bugs?

1566
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,713
No,
but that's the best way I can compare 

1567
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:45,510
them.
I've had bugs on me.

1568
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:49,020
I don't care for them three times.
Are you a book?

1569
01:04:49,021 --> 01:04:50,160
Kutcher,
uh,

1570
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,510
no,
those guys are crazy,

1571
01:04:51,511 --> 01:04:52,980
man.
Fuck yeah,

1572
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,720
they actually almost want it.
Yeah,

1573
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:55,760
they do want,
they want it.

1574
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:59,180
I think it's pressure.
Tell people what we're talking about.

1575
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:02,370
Bug catchers are guys I've only heard of
being gay guy.

1576
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,233
Maybe the straight guys just do it,
but they'll go out and fuck guys trying 

1577
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:08,220
to catch HIV or let guys fuck them.
Let guys fuck that.

1578
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:08,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

1579
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:10,770
I mean like guys fuck them to catch HIV.
Like they really,

1580
01:05:10,771 --> 01:05:12,220
they want it.
Um,

1581
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:14,520
and I,
I personally think it's because then the

1582
01:05:14,521 --> 01:05:16,390
pressure is off.
Um,

1583
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:18,180
that's my guess.
I don't comprehend it.

1584
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,020
Think it's a self hate thing.
Well maybe.

1585
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:20,913
Yeah.
I think it's the same reason why some 

1586
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:23,970
people want to amputate their hands.
You know,

1587
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,130
some people are just nuts.
That is kind of a nutty thing to do,

1588
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,300
to want to catch,
you know,

1589
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:31,660
like why I don't even want it now.
Even though I know that there's medicine

1590
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,840
that stops it.
But we were talking about this yesterday

1591
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:34,683
was like,
people that,

1592
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:39,040
why do people like fisting?
It's just a show that your your past,

1593
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:41,770
what everybody else is thinking of his 
hardcore,

1594
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,720
like I'll take a whole fist right up to 
the elbow.

1595
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,670
Some women's pussies are weird though,
man.

1596
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:46,503
Like I gave the girl I dating a girl.
You used to never get all of it and I 

1597
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:52,750
would get.
I have little hands too,

1598
01:05:52,751 --> 01:05:57,370
but I'll get like the first four on my 
part of my knuckle and that would be our

1599
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:58,204
dirty talk.
Like she would go crazy when I would 

1600
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:02,380
talk to her and tell her that what I'm 
going to do is I'm gonna I'm gonna.

1601
01:06:02,381 --> 01:06:04,720
I'm gonna curl the thumb.
When I told I was in a curl,

1602
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:06,640
the thumbs she knew that the fist was 
going in.

1603
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,713
She'd go fucking nuts.
Even though I was just talking dirty 

1604
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:10,473
tour,
I would say I'm going to curl the thumb 

1605
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:12,243
and she knew that mental.
He's putting his fucking fight but I 

1606
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:15,850
couldn't.
It bitch.

1607
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:17,870
Yeah.
I could never get all of it is I got.

1608
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,410
I would get it in like this.
Like a,

1609
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:20,620
like a praying mantis.

1610
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,990
Like you're poking like a bird.
Yeah.

1611
01:06:22,991 --> 01:06:24,670
Well,
your thumb is touching the floor,

1612
01:06:24,671 --> 01:06:25,750
curled fates,
cheating.

1613
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:28,410
It's a cheating way to fifth somebody.
I don't get it.

1614
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:32,080
My asshole has zero ability to take more
than a finger.

1615
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,420
Oh yeah,
a whole fist.

1616
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,553
There's a video that Nick Swardson sent 
me and Whitney were talking about it 

1617
01:06:37,781 --> 01:06:38,490
yesterday.
We're,

1618
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:41,290
there's a dude.
He's holding a dude up,

1619
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:42,520
like in front of him,
like,

1620
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:44,890
you know,
like a sort of a backpack on the front,

1621
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,073
you know,
the guys around him and he's got his 

1622
01:06:46,871 --> 01:06:51,430
fist all the way up to the elbow and 
this guy's ass and he just keeps pumping

1623
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:53,530
it up in there and he's holding the guy.
Yeah,

1624
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:54,750
he's holding them up.
Oh,

1625
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,673
he's got his arm wrapped around them and
then the other arm is just going in 

1626
01:06:58,001 --> 01:07:01,240
their credit that both of those guys.
It's amazing.

1627
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:02,920
Derek Pioneers for sure.

1628
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:03,993
That reminds me of holding up.
I was watching season two again of the 

1629
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:10,150
ultimate fighter and there's one thing 
where they do like how long,

1630
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:13,330
how many rotations around the 
heavyweight can.

1631
01:07:13,331 --> 01:07:15,250
I think they were either a middleweight 
or welterweight.

1632
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:17,470
Do were he climbs on top of the 
heavyweight.

1633
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:19,870
I've never seen that before.
Uh,

1634
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:20,773
and he was going around like,
how many different times can you go 

1635
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:25,000
around this heavyweight body without 
touching the ground?

1636
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:26,163
I figured 10:50.
I mean it was fucking a hundred or 200 

1637
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:34,080
times the way around,
the ability to hold somebody else up.

1638
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:35,463
But see,
the thing about something like that is 

1639
01:07:36,581 --> 01:07:37,414
doing a contest like that.
You gotta realize that person's blown 

1640
01:07:39,821 --> 01:07:40,654
their body out for days after that,
if that's not something you're 

1641
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:44,800
accustomed to and you're doing on a 
daily basis,

1642
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:49,510
that's like doing a chin up contest like
David Goggins,

1643
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,760
like if you do that,
don't plan on fighting.

1644
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:52,653
You know,
how is your arms are going to be blown 

1645
01:07:53,951 --> 01:07:54,700
out,
your,

1646
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,390
your legs are going to be blown out.
You're,

1647
01:07:56,391 --> 01:07:59,350
you're going to get fucked up.
It's definitely a good skill to have,

1648
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:00,543
but doing something like that,
you could do it one time to find out 

1649
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:04,564
what your Max is,
but don't plan on recovering from that 

1650
01:08:07,181 --> 01:08:08,014
anytime soon.
That's the thing about people in 

1651
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:10,264
injuries,
like one of the big problems with 

1652
01:08:11,831 --> 01:08:14,170
injuries with MMA fighters,
Jujitsu people,

1653
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:16,040
a lot of people is overtraining,

1654
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,640
meaning you're not prepared for what 
you're doing.

1655
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,713
Like I have a friend,
my friend Cam hands runs a marathon a 

1656
01:08:22,761 --> 01:08:24,890
day.
He runs a marathon every day.

1657
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:26,190
Well,
he had a buildup to that.

1658
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,340
Does he really?
Yeah.

1659
01:08:27,341 --> 01:08:28,174
He's.
He's training for this 238 Mile Moab a 

1660
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:36,680
race in October,
so if you're running 238 miles,

1661
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:40,370
his ideas,
he gets a marathon in every day,

1662
01:08:40,371 --> 01:08:43,370
so his body is just constantly used to 
this sort of stress,

1663
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:46,160
but for him it's not that big a deal.
Like he'll run a marathon.

1664
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,080
It's not a problem,
but if you tried to run a marathon every

1665
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:51,913
day your body would break down.
You'd have some serious issues and the 

1666
01:08:53,751 --> 01:08:55,610
first day I couldn't do it.
Yeah,

1667
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,310
but again,
you might be able to do it.

1668
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,900
It might be able to take you eight 
hours.

1669
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:00,853
You might be able to get through it,
but you're going to be fucked up for 

1670
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:03,644
awhile,
but if you built up to it slowly over 

1671
01:09:06,171 --> 01:09:10,430
time you could develop the kind of 
muscular endurance that allows you to do

1672
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:11,900
something like that.
You get conditioned to it.

1673
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,440
So like doing something like that where 
you're doing like these rotations around

1674
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:18,740
someone or you're doing like how many 
times he climbed to the top of a 30 foot

1675
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:19,574
rope,
you know,

1676
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:20,443
someone's doing something like that.
If that's not something you do all the 

1677
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:25,940
time and you just try to do it once,
like on a television show for,

1678
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:27,290
for funsies.
Sure.

1679
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,940
You could fuck yourself up.

1680
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:32,011
Yeah,
no,

1681
01:09:32,011 --> 01:09:33,990
I'm just saying things along those 
lines.

1682
01:09:33,991 --> 01:09:36,450
Like when you're trying to do as many as
you can,

1683
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,433
anytime you're doing as many as you can.
Like how many bodyweight squats can you 

1684
01:09:40,411 --> 01:09:42,150
do?
Maybe 100,

1685
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:42,751
you know,
like,

1686
01:09:42,751 --> 01:09:44,890
okay,
let's see if you can get to $500.

1687
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,690
Good luck walking for the last couple of
days if that's.

1688
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,540
If you try to do that.
I like a couple of.

1689
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,473
Is it now this guy does chin up.
Does he do like the perfect military 

1690
01:09:52,381 --> 01:09:52,921
ones?
Probably.

1691
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:54,230
If he's a navy seal,
I'm sure you lil boys.

1692
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:55,630
Full Body,
hand up.

1693
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:58,720
Yeah.
Those kipping Chin ups are kind of where

1694
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:03,090
they flop around like a fish are going 
to use the ones where they go,

1695
01:10:03,091 --> 01:10:03,924
they lift up and then they go hire.
Like when they pull their full body 

1696
01:10:05,851 --> 01:10:09,780
weight above the muscle up,
fuck that.

1697
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:12,910
You're just chin up and then you do a 
dip and then it's not.

1698
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:16,650
It's a lot of people think it's not the 
best functional exercise.

1699
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:18,300
They think it looks cool and everything 
like that,

1700
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,930
but they don't believe it's.
It's a vest,

1701
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:22,170
functional exercise,
but the guys that can do that,

1702
01:10:22,171 --> 01:10:23,004
so like I've always.
I've looked at guys do that with these 

1703
01:10:24,151 --> 01:10:25,890
guys that do these,
these guys,

1704
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:26,963
these guys are freaks.
These are outdoor guys where they work 

1705
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:32,640
outdoors and they can just do an endless
amount of things outdoors.

1706
01:10:32,641 --> 01:10:35,110
They can hold the bar sideways.
They're like,

1707
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:35,963
look at what this guy's doing.
He's just doing like Chin ups and dips 

1708
01:10:39,091 --> 01:10:41,730
and sideways.
Incredible.

1709
01:10:41,731 --> 01:10:44,360
The upper body strength and control.
Yeah.

1710
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:47,860
Not just the strength but like the 
static control,

1711
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:49,710
these able to do like,
oh my God,

1712
01:10:49,711 --> 01:10:50,544
he's fuck.
It looks like he's being blown into a 

1713
01:10:51,111 --> 01:10:51,931
hurricane.
Yeah,

1714
01:10:51,931 --> 01:10:54,460
a lot of people do those really called 
flag poles.

1715
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,010
Can you do that?
I've never done that.

1716
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,680
Why am I saying that?
Surprising?

1717
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:59,790
Of course I can't do it.
It's not easy,

1718
01:10:59,791 --> 01:11:01,770
but I could do it.
So what does,

1719
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:02,843
what does that mean?
These guys don't have that kind of 

1720
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,140
balance.
Like that guy is a.

1721
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,170
he's doing like a,
a dip to a handstand.

1722
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,970
I can't do that in between the two bars.
Yeah.

1723
01:11:11,971 --> 01:11:12,840
And these guys,
they all wear,

1724
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:14,190
which I find interesting.

1725
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:17,010
I guess they do that because the,
the bars get sweaty.

1726
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:18,710
Yeah.
You also don't want to slip and probably

1727
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,610
flux your hands up.
Yeah.

1728
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:24,180
I used to work little fingerless gloves 
when I worked out just to keep my hands.

1729
01:11:24,181 --> 01:11:26,140
I'm like curly from mice and men like 
dice.

1730
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:27,143
Yeah,
exactly.

1731
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,450
Keep my hand smooth and softwares those 
because he are the one shake hands and I

1732
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,040
was on.
I was on the road though.

1733
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,990
He's the would do when someone would 
come over,

1734
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,760
he curls his.
He has a fingerless gloves.

1735
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:36,594
They'll curl his fingers into the glove 
and give them a fist to shake the 

1736
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:40,700
fucking worse.

1737
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:43,763
He's so crazy.
He hated shaking hands with people and 

1738
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:47,244
he would go and watch this.
I remember one time we were out to eat 

1739
01:11:48,121 --> 01:11:48,954
and some guy he washed his hands on.
Guy came over and shook his hand and 

1740
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,293
said,
oh,

1741
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,310
I up.
I had to go to the bathroom again.

1742
01:11:53,311 --> 01:11:56,010
It's so funny that he's just,
he's such a pig on stage,

1743
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:59,530
but he hates germs.
He likes fucking honey and his tea.

1744
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:01,710
Like he's just a big Mama's boy.
He likes to be comforted.

1745
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,990
He's an.
He's a very interesting guy.

1746
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:04,824
Dies and he's also in a lot of ways a 
pioneer because he was one of the very 

1747
01:12:09,361 --> 01:12:12,650
first ever superstar stadium comedian.
Yes,

1748
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,400
he was.
There was no one like that.

1749
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:16,800
Like even kinison never hit that level 
before.

1750
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:19,710
Steve Martin,
I think at one point had that.

1751
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:20,460
But yeah,
but.

1752
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,870
And he had a tremendous mistake.

1753
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,320
Tilt them to Steve Martin.
Was was,

1754
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:25,110
was the biggest comic in the world for a
long time,

1755
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:27,480
but dice had this thing where he,
uh,

1756
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,210
he came out like a fist and just punch 
through everything.

1757
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:33,090
No one saw him coming.
There was no snl.

1758
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:35,220
It was just this fucking animal.
Like,

1759
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:37,270
I remember the first time I standardized
play.

1760
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,800
I was a girl named Melanie who.
No,

1761
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:39,390
no.
Uh,

1762
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:39,981
uh,
whatever the fuck.

1763
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:42,060
Her name is Michelle.
My girlfriend,

1764
01:12:42,061 --> 01:12:43,350
I was 18.
I was at her house.

1765
01:12:43,351 --> 01:12:44,101
So she's like,
come in here.

1766
01:12:44,101 --> 01:12:44,934
This guy is so dirty.
And I stood there and watched Andrew 

1767
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:51,150
dice clay the first time.
You remember Richard Price by favorite?

1768
01:12:51,151 --> 01:12:51,984
Carla.
I don't remember the first time I saw 

1769
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:54,590
them,
but I remember the first time I saw,

1770
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:55,503
I remember the first time I played dice 
dice cassette to this girl that I was 

1771
01:12:58,741 --> 01:12:59,310
dating.

1772
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:03,110
Her name was [inaudible].
She was from Nicaragua and uh,

1773
01:13:03,111 --> 01:13:05,400
we were in my car.
I think I was like,

1774
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,193
I think I was 19 and uh,
we were sitting in my car playing this 

1775
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:13,770
dice clay thing,
fucking howling laughing.

1776
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:17,190
I couldn't believe how dirty it was.
And how funny it was,

1777
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,000
it was,
it was,

1778
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,910
it was dirty and it was funny.
Do you,

1779
01:13:19,911 --> 01:13:21,710
do you ever have Florentine on?
No.

1780
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,070
Oh yeah.
Have I had Jim on?

1781
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:24,083
I feel like I have.
Jim Florentine is hilarious and when he 

1782
01:13:26,671 --> 01:13:27,504
used to do is he would make his 
girlfriend mixed tapes of all these 

1783
01:13:29,431 --> 01:13:30,264
romantic songs and he would put fucking 
bits from the day the laughter died and 

1784
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:38,300
the day of the laughter died and just 
align or to play like a really nice song

1785
01:13:38,301 --> 01:13:40,320
that I want to eat.
You're cutting a big red chair.

1786
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:41,383
And then I saw.
It's funny as a glass of milk my 

1787
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:47,550
favorite.
Heck align ever.

1788
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:48,470
Yeah.
Oh.

1789
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:51,350
Because dice had been talking about 
drinking milk and slipping on it.

1790
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,193
Like it's come.
People are slipping like somebody load 

1791
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:57,750
and the guy is so mad the audience,
he can't grasp what to say.

1792
01:13:57,751 --> 01:13:58,584
She goes,
you're a funny as a bottle of milk 

1793
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:02,920
because he just used what dice had just 
said onstage.

1794
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:03,763
Well,
we explained to people the day the 

1795
01:14:04,461 --> 01:14:07,140
laughter died was when dice was on top 
of the world.

1796
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:11,100
He decided to record at danger fields 
unannounced.

1797
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:11,990
So danger

1798
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:16,330
fields in New York is a historically 
been like,

1799
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:18,310
uh,
a poorly attended club.

1800
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,090
Sure.
Like,

1801
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:21,550
we would do shows how poorly attended it
is.

1802
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:26,440
I did a show there once where I think my
spot was probably like at 9:00

1803
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:28,760
and I got there at 8:30
and uh,

1804
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:30,880
there's just a couple of comics hanging 
out at the bar.

1805
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:32,013
I was like,
what's going on?

1806
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,700
And they go,
no one's here yet.

1807
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:34,983
And I go,
what?

1808
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,610
No one's here.
There's no audience.

1809
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,150
So two people showed up a couple.
They said a,

1810
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,170
we're here to show.
And Remember Scotty,

1811
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,180
the big guy,
the big Irish guy,

1812
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:44,820
bobby,
bobby rather.

1813
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:46,603
Oh yeah,
bottom.

1814
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:48,220
He was Scott.
I'm sorry I fucked it up.

1815
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:49,240
Bobby.
He was like,

1816
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,470
right this way,
ladies and gentlemen.

1817
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,930
And he brought these people into an 
empty room and they're like,

1818
01:14:52,931 --> 01:14:53,764
what?
And they sat them down and then the MC 

1819
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:56,260
went up.

1820
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,093
So they started to show a half hour late
because that was the first time people 

1821
01:14:59,321 --> 01:15:03,810
showed up and we all did sets for two 
fucking people have done.

1822
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:09,280
It was really weird.
So dice sides to record his album.

1823
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:14,360
They're unannounced with no material.
He had no preparation.

1824
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:15,783
He just winged it the entire thing and 
it's both brilliant and terrible at the 

1825
01:15:20,801 --> 01:15:21,634
same time.
It's a two CD thing because it was like 

1826
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:25,510
he was up there for fucking hours,
three nights,

1827
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:31,950
three nights,
and he was up there with.

1828
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:32,784
That's dice at danger fields from the 
special that that's when he did Rodney 

1829
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:39,580
dangerfield special.
So we toured with him.

1830
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,980
No,
that he was on Rodney Dangerfield,

1831
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:43,660
HBO special.
That's how he broke.

1832
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:47,080
And then he came back and did the day.
The laughter died.

1833
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:47,943
But I don't think there's any pictures.
Clips out of Kenny was with him when he 

1834
01:15:52,181 --> 01:15:52,730
did those.

1835
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:53,563
Those cds.
I'm so jealous that he got to watch 

1836
01:15:55,091 --> 01:15:55,924
those tapings.
Well Kenny was like his bodyguard or 

1837
01:15:57,911 --> 01:15:58,530
something,
right.

1838
01:15:58,530 --> 01:15:59,363
Wasn't manager body guard.
When I first started the dice it was 

1839
01:16:01,421 --> 01:16:02,254
like 1997 and it was.
Kenny was the road manager and a body 

1840
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:07,420
guard.
Is that Rodney and Fabio?

1841
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,050
Wow.
Is that and dice?

1842
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:11,180
Who's that?
Rodney.

1843
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,790
His wife would get mad,
I guess.

1844
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:15,340
Is that Rodney's wife or no?
Is that Fabio getting married?

1845
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:16,563
Someone's getting married.
Fabio can get married with a shirt open 

1846
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:19,024
like that radius.
So that day the laughter died for 

1847
01:16:22,241 --> 01:16:24,620
Comedians.
There was a guy named Mike Donovan who's

1848
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,220
a Boston comedy legend.
Fucking hilarious,

1849
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:28,054
hilarious comedian,
and he is the one who told me about the 

1850
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,420
day the laughter died,
didn't he?

1851
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:32,283
We were in the back of the comedy 
connection and he was just laughing 

1852
01:16:34,151 --> 01:16:36,670
until he was crying,
talking about dice,

1853
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,160
do an impression of Nixon while he's 
eating.

1854
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:44,990
I'll do Nixon in that ass.
Give me that book.

1855
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:49,000
Fat fucking.
I mean,

1856
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:53,170
he was doing a Nixon impression while 
he's eating as and for whatever reason,

1857
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:55,480
Mike Donovan thought it was the funniest
thing I've ever heard in his life.

1858
01:16:55,481 --> 01:16:58,090
He's just cry and laugh and it's like,
this is a brilliant,

1859
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,880
brilliant album.
It is Rick Rubin producers out there.

1860
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:02,110
Yeah.
For that album.

1861
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:04,660
It's a.
it's an odd masterpiece.

1862
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:05,341
It's a.
it's,

1863
01:17:05,341 --> 01:17:06,174
it's,
it's a beautiful that he did that 

1864
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:10,310
because there is a flow to it,
but it's like it's the greatest.

1865
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:11,323
Watching a comics mind just fucking 
randomly bounce from joke to joke to 

1866
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:19,850
bomb to joke and just really exploring 
and grabbing for shit.

1867
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:22,550
Yeah.
And there's no material preparation,

1868
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:23,384
you know,
you can tell he's just totally ad 

1869
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:30,420
libbing.
Yeah.

1870
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:31,263
That's the album cover.
I remember getting it and listening to 

1871
01:17:33,951 --> 01:17:36,530
and being so close.
Look at that cassette one.

1872
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,430
Yeah.
And people who didn't know I liked,

1873
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:40,580
there was also people who didn't like 
it,

1874
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,380
like this sucks.
What is this?

1875
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,633
But uh,
Chris rock is at the seller one night 

1876
01:17:44,721 --> 01:17:46,930
and I forget how it goes,
the best comedy album ever.

1877
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:50,140
One of them he said did after that I'll 
have to die by Angela,

1878
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,073
but that's also the best comedy album 
for him because he's a comic and he 

1879
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,220
thinks it's hilarious.
This guy just went up there and just had

1880
01:17:58,221 --> 01:18:02,360
no fucking no preparation whatsoever.
I've laughed harder.

1881
01:18:02,361 --> 01:18:03,194
But your prior albums,
and I did it that there are better 

1882
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:07,250
comedy record,
but as far as being a pure thing to show

1883
01:18:07,251 --> 01:18:09,440
like what comics do sometimes to work 
stuff out.

1884
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:10,940
He literally,
like you said,

1885
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:11,631
Papa,
this game,

1886
01:18:11,631 --> 01:18:13,100
he was fucking 19,
99.

1887
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:15,500
Probably sold a million copies of that 
too.

1888
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,450
Yeah,
to a fucking 800,000

1889
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,293
unhappy people.

1890
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:24,410
He didn't even call the day the laughter
die.

1891
01:18:24,411 --> 01:18:25,244
He didn't give a fuck.
He would go up sometimes and literally 

1892
01:18:27,681 --> 01:18:30,530
like to see how long he could go without
getting a laugh and clubs.

1893
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:35,270
He would just fuck around and see how 
long he could go and not get a laugh.

1894
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:37,640
My favorite is insult.
Dice.

1895
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:39,590
When you find someone in the audience 
and go look,

1896
01:18:39,591 --> 01:18:42,890
good,
you look good to really cut your fucking

1897
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:48,010
hair digging on people and they wouldn't
know whether to laugh or be upset and it

1898
01:18:50,331 --> 01:18:51,164
would be like.
It was almost angry at them for being 

1899
01:18:53,151 --> 01:18:53,984
alive.
He described women's tits and he and he 

1900
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:56,864
goes,
look at those big fat fucking mother 

1901
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:02,270
fucking fat fucking tits.
And it was really dirty,

1902
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:03,440
but I'm like,
my God,

1903
01:19:03,441 --> 01:19:06,350
that's emotionally the best description 
of tits.

1904
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,930
Everyone's big ones.
That's how you feel though.

1905
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:13,730
You can't get the words that will 
describe the lust of big breasts,

1906
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,390
more than fat.

1907
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:16,380
Fucking motherfucking fat.
Fucking it.

1908
01:19:16,381 --> 01:19:17,870
There was something so guttural about 
that.

1909
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:19,820
I'm like,
that's the greatest description of tits.

1910
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,580
And nobody's ever given.
As far as emotionally for a guy.

1911
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,533
Well,
you know what dice did to that nobody 

1912
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:28,190
else has ever done before or since.
Has He created punchlines that everybody

1913
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:29,660
wanted to repeat?
Yes.

1914
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:31,363
Those wines are amazing.
People wanting to repeat what's in the 

1915
01:19:33,801 --> 01:19:34,634
bowl bitch.
Like he would point the microphone to 

1916
01:19:36,591 --> 01:19:40,400
the audience and they knew the punchline
and they would yell it out and cheer.

1917
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,160
Yeah,
on day left die.

1918
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,340
They tried doing a poem.
He goes,

1919
01:19:43,341 --> 01:19:46,850
no stupid.
Like doing poems.

1920
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,140
Know poems.
Yeah.

1921
01:19:48,141 --> 01:19:50,600
He had no qualms.
Not even,

1922
01:19:50,601 --> 01:19:51,650
hey,
I'm not doing that.

1923
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,730
Like Robin Williams did in the album 
called a reality.

1924
01:19:55,731 --> 01:19:56,564
What a concept,
which was the first dirty album I ever 

1925
01:19:57,711 --> 01:19:58,544
had was Robin Williams reality.
What a cop before even prior and he and 

1926
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:03,680
somebody yelled out,
mark and Robin goes,

1927
01:20:03,681 --> 01:20:05,240
I'm not doing more.
Come here to do something different.

1928
01:20:05,241 --> 01:20:07,070
Like he,
he did it nicely and people clapped,

1929
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:08,280
but he didn't go.

1930
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:12,660
No,
like with dice,

1931
01:20:12,661 --> 01:20:13,494
they needed them that night and they're 
just trying to connect with other poem 

1932
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,750
and he could've got them.
Fuck you.

1933
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:20,523
They get it.
They almost were being punked like they 

1934
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:27,240
were there for a comedy show and the 
most famous comic alive at the time.

1935
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,153
Yes.
Came up and just ate dick for three 

1936
01:20:29,461 --> 01:20:33,150
hours a day for three fucking hours over
three night period.

1937
01:20:33,151 --> 01:20:37,320
It's a nine hour fucking ball munching,
but he also,

1938
01:20:37,330 --> 01:20:38,590
it was funny male,
he dies.

1939
01:20:38,591 --> 01:20:39,424
Changed the language.
Like people like what did political 

1940
01:20:40,821 --> 01:20:41,654
correct to start.
If you look back to when it really 

1941
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:44,700
kicked in,
it was.

1942
01:20:44,701 --> 01:20:49,080
They were so disgusted and angry at 
dice.

1943
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:50,940
That was what kicked political.
Correct.

1944
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:51,391
Plus,
you know,

1945
01:20:51,391 --> 01:20:53,520
the Internet was really kicking in.
There's a lot of factors,

1946
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:54,773
but dice is the one who was,
he was the straw that broke the broke 

1947
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,400
people like I can't fucking take 
anymore.

1948
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:01,170
We have to stop talking this way.
Well,

1949
01:21:01,171 --> 01:21:04,460
he went on MTV,
remember the,

1950
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:09,580
he did a bunch of jokes that they didn't
approve and they banned him from MTV for

1951
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:11,640
life.
And meanwhile,

1952
01:21:11,641 --> 01:21:14,070
today that's a God damn.
I mean,

1953
01:21:14,071 --> 01:21:15,240
badge of honor.
Yeah,

1954
01:21:15,241 --> 01:21:17,070
he went,
nobody wants to be on MTV now,

1955
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,140
but back then it was like,
Holy Shit.

1956
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:22,140
They banned him from Auntie VI.
Kennison criticized him for that.

1957
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,333
He built,
he went out and Kurt loder was on TV 

1958
01:21:25,261 --> 01:21:28,950
talking about how unfunny terrible 
unfunny period jokes,

1959
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,593
you know,
it's like,

1960
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:34,460
but it was this,
this air of like pompousness like,

1961
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:37,020
and he was talking about this is 
progressive,

1962
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:39,990
you know,
Kurt loder type character who was always

1963
01:21:39,991 --> 01:21:41,550
like the guy who told you about the 
amazing,

1964
01:21:41,551 --> 01:21:42,384
cool new bands was telling you the dice,
just terrible and unfunny and you'll 

1965
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:46,980
never be on MTV.
Uh,

1966
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:49,560
Ken and I remember thinking that like,
whoa.

1967
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:53,550
They banned him from siren it live.
They banned him from MTV.

1968
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:57,630
He didn't give a fuck or Kenny again.
I,

1969
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:01,140
Kenny told me that the Guy Andrew may 
have told me this too,

1970
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,660
but before he went out,
he was thinking of doing it.

1971
01:22:03,661 --> 01:22:05,790
It might've been,
I'm not.

1972
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:06,870
Who's The guy?
Johnny?

1973
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,300
Uh,
Johnny he had with them,

1974
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:11,940
um,
whose name I don't remember fucking.

1975
01:22:11,941 --> 01:22:12,930
Oh my God.
You know,

1976
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:15,540
it's the journey that he traveled with 
for years.

1977
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,730
Is it possible to not noodles?
Um,

1978
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,410
no,
no,

1979
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:22,370
something johnny.
But he said,

1980
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:23,490
uh,
he said to dice,

1981
01:22:23,491 --> 01:22:25,440
do you want to be a teardrop or a tidal 
wave?

1982
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:26,873
Which I thought was such a great fucking
piece of advice to give someone before 

1983
01:22:30,631 --> 01:22:33,060
he went out on live television with that
dilemma.

1984
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:34,103
Well now I mean,
now that it's all the dust has been 

1985
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:38,340
settled.
Who?

1986
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:39,320
Johnny what?

1987
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,430
What's the,
what was his name?

1988
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,240
No hot tubs.
John and Jesus.

1989
01:22:42,241 --> 01:22:43,500
I never met him.
I'd never met him.

1990
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:45,150
He was he a comic?
I don't know.

1991
01:22:45,151 --> 01:22:47,300
He was dices guy.
He write wrote with dice.

1992
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:48,134
He toured with them.
I think he was the road manager at one 

1993
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:50,180
point,
but I never met hot tub.

1994
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:52,830
It was.
Kenny was there when I came in in 1997,

1995
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:55,230
but that was the name fucking forgetting
shit man.

1996
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:56,064
You went well.
It's just like a slick rick should 

1997
01:22:58,501 --> 01:22:58,941
happen.
Yeah,

1998
01:22:58,941 --> 01:22:59,970
it does.
Well,

1999
01:22:59,971 --> 01:23:02,410
you have too many experiences,
you know,

2000
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:06,040
like you talked to someone who lives in 
a small town about a small town

2001
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,903
and the stuff that he does in that town 
that motherfucking can remember 

2002
01:23:08,891 --> 01:23:09,724
everything,
but talk to a guy who travels the world 

2003
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:15,040
and to stand up and takes pills to stop 
getting aids.

2004
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,830
Boy,
what a sigh of relief.

2005
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,360
I was fucking,
I'll tell you,

2006
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:21,260
one of the most nervous I've ever been 
was when I took the,

2007
01:23:21,261 --> 01:23:22,360
uh,
just to digress for a second,

2008
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:23,194
was to take the uh,
I was so convinced that HIV and I 

2009
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:29,320
fucking took this oral test that you can
get from cvs.

2010
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:30,603
And there's a weird thing where you just
said it's up a good up until the last 

2011
01:23:33,671 --> 01:23:34,810
three months.
It's like in the high,

2012
01:23:34,811 --> 01:23:36,730
90 percent accurate.
Not One hundred percent,

2013
01:23:36,731 --> 01:23:38,770
but it's a good precursor to the bucket 
blood.

2014
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:41,100
So I did it.
And you have to,

2015
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:41,610
you,
you,

2016
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:42,443
you,
you rub it on your gums once each and 

2017
01:23:43,901 --> 01:23:45,130
then you put it in this,
this,

2018
01:23:45,131 --> 01:23:46,300
uh,
this folding,

2019
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:47,560
like almost like a trapper keeper.

2020
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,393
And you close it and they say what 
happens is there's a red line and if 

2021
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:53,650
there's two red lines,
you're positive,

2022
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,020
the one red line stays there.
And they said,

2023
01:23:56,021 --> 01:24:00,000
do not watch the progress because it 
will freak you out.

2024
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:03,370
Don't watch it.
Of course you watch it only for a second

2025
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,353
because I literally thought I saw the 
beginning of a second line and I 

2026
01:24:07,571 --> 01:24:10,540
remember closing it and I'm like,
I have HIV.

2027
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,830
I was fucking convinced.
I went,

2028
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:15,610
I remember where I went.
It went down to the fucking store,

2029
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,620
bought a couple of rx bars.
I'm like,

2030
01:24:17,621 --> 01:24:20,380
I'm just going to have a nice fucking 
protein bar and go back and 20 minutes,

2031
01:24:20,381 --> 01:24:24,070
whatever it was.
And I couldn't black I to photograph it.

2032
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,810
I couldn't believe that I was negative.
But I came back and it was clear I was,

2033
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:29,950
I was a hundred percent convinced that 
HIV was scary.

2034
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:30,783
Man.
I'm well anytime there's something like 

2035
01:24:32,411 --> 01:24:34,900
that where you don't know if you have it
and if you do have it,

2036
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:35,734
it's a death sentence or even it wasn't 
even that thought was die because now 

2037
01:24:38,681 --> 01:24:39,820
there's so many.
This is recent,

2038
01:24:39,821 --> 01:24:40,654
this is probably three months ago.
There's so many medications you can 

2039
01:24:42,431 --> 01:24:43,264
take,
but it's the idea of having to tell a 

2040
01:24:45,041 --> 01:24:45,874
partner and like,
who's going to want to fuck you with 

2041
01:24:46,921 --> 01:24:48,310
that?
Like that's just a rough one.

2042
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:50,170
You know what I mean?
I'm dating someone.

2043
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:52,690
I'm going to tell her I kind of Charlie 
Sheen,

2044
01:24:52,691 --> 01:24:53,950
get it.
I don't know.

2045
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:57,130
And if you noticed that was the question
that Matt Lauer,

2046
01:24:57,131 --> 01:24:59,140
I don't believe asked.
Um,

2047
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:01,300
I don't think they got into it.
So I don't know.

2048
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:02,183
Yeah.
So Matt Lauer and him talk because he 

2049
01:25:04,661 --> 01:25:06,100
was getting blackmailed.
Yes,

2050
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:06,934
he was.
There's a shit ton of lawsuits because 

2051
01:25:10,091 --> 01:25:10,924
he had an unprotected sex without 
telling a bunch of people that he had 

2052
01:25:13,121 --> 01:25:13,600
it.

2053
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,710
That's crazy.
I mean,

2054
01:25:14,711 --> 01:25:16,240
that's,
that's crazy.

2055
01:25:16,241 --> 01:25:19,100
Even if you're down to zero,
then you still got to tell them,

2056
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:20,713
tell them to zero where it's not visible
because they can knock it down to where 

2057
01:25:24,461 --> 01:25:28,150
it's undetectable and I really do think 
you can't pass it then because there are

2058
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:30,250
drugs that you won't be able to pass it 
and prep.

2059
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:31,084
We won't able to get it,
but I still think you're obligated to 

2060
01:25:32,681 --> 01:25:33,620
say it.
You know,

2061
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:36,970
you're obligated to say it and then you 
let that person make the decision.

2062
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:37,960
Right.
You know what I mean?

2063
01:25:37,961 --> 01:25:38,310
You,
you,

2064
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:41,000
you can't make that decision for them.
Yeah,

2065
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:41,891
no,
for sure.

2066
01:25:41,891 --> 01:25:42,724
But I mean this is all cocaine party 
mean everyone's just having terrible 

2067
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:48,970
judgment.
Yeah.

2068
01:25:48,971 --> 01:25:49,804
I imagine that was quite a bit of 
naughty behavior in the residence times 

2069
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:54,820
doing tremendous amounts of blow.
Yeah.

2070
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:55,663
Like they would talk about him doing 
below that would kill a normal size 

2071
01:25:57,341 --> 01:25:58,174
person.
I heard somebody to what I've heard 

2072
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:00,154
about the black male and I don't know,
I really wish I knew who had blacked 

2073
01:26:01,771 --> 01:26:02,560
out.
I don't.

2074
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,010
Was that got a picture of

2075
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:09,010
medication in his medicine cabinet is a 
video of him sucking a guy's Dick.

2076
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,810
Um,
I've heard that too.

2077
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:13,250
I've heard that,
but I don't know.

2078
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:14,180
That's true.
I mean,

2079
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:15,014
you think he probably didn't know that 
video's being to y'all that was taken 

2080
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:18,120
without him knowing.
Well,

2081
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,540
who knows?
Maybe when you're coked up like film it.

2082
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:21,680
Let's do it.
Yeah.

2083
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:26,540
You know,
I mean when you have a kid that's rough.

2084
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:27,374
I mean otherwise,
like who cares if he sucked a dick who 

2085
01:26:28,281 --> 01:26:29,114
gives a fuck?
And you're great and platoon when you 

2086
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:32,210
give a shit.
But you know what I mean?

2087
01:26:32,211 --> 01:26:33,980
It gives a fuck.
Major League who's really,

2088
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:34,910
you know,
believe me,

2089
01:26:34,911 --> 01:26:36,310
I'm very unsung.
Film it.

2090
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:37,960
Wall Street.
It was good in it.

2091
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,080
Ha.
Very good.

2092
01:26:39,081 --> 01:26:41,480
Most him and Martin Sheen together.
Fuck crazy.

2093
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:45,920
I think that a certain point in time 
when you're doing that kind of drugs,

2094
01:26:45,921 --> 01:26:50,921
like you're doing crazy disassociative 
piles of blow and you're fucking,

2095
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,240
you don't know where the fuck you are.

2096
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,890
You're freaking out.
You're constantly paranoid.

2097
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:56,780
They said its teeth were rotting out of 
his head.

2098
01:26:56,781 --> 01:26:57,614
It looked like a few pictures of his 
teeth did not look like they are in 

2099
01:26:58,671 --> 01:26:59,504
amazing shape.
A sheen also doesn't know how he 

2100
01:27:02,391 --> 01:27:05,480
contracted the virus,
but told lauer it had nothing to do with

2101
01:27:05,481 --> 01:27:06,050
needles.
Oh,

2102
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:08,600
well then he does have a good idea.
Well,

2103
01:27:08,601 --> 01:27:09,261
how could he say?
Well,

2104
01:27:09,261 --> 01:27:11,390
it means you mean sexually.
He had nothing.

2105
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:14,960
He never did anything with needles.
Rumors about the actress health recently

2106
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:17,870
emerged in the tabloid press.
So where,

2107
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,310
where,
where's he at now?

2108
01:27:19,311 --> 01:27:22,280
Like he's like Khan.
He's kind of fucking radio dark,

2109
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,240
nothing.
He just did a film.

2110
01:27:23,241 --> 01:27:25,550
He did a film that nine slash 11,
but people trapped in an elevator.

2111
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,320
He's um,
and they said,

2112
01:27:27,321 --> 01:27:27,921
well,
you know,

2113
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:29,870
he had some conspiracy theories they 
shouldn't have cast.

2114
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:30,740
So it gives a fuck.

2115
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:32,480
It's a movie.
None of these people are dead.

2116
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:33,740
They're alive.
They just did a movie.

2117
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:34,603
Well,
do you remember he wrote an open letter 

2118
01:27:35,571 --> 01:27:36,404
to President Obama.
He's a big fan of Alex Jones and friend 

2119
01:27:39,531 --> 01:27:42,230
of Alex Jones.
And He,

2120
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,990
Alex Jones called me up.
Hey Man,

2121
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:49,010
Gary Busey wants to talk to you.
And then he fucking.

2122
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:49,933
Gary Busey.
And Gary Busey talked to me and he's 

2123
01:27:52,221 --> 01:27:52,830
like,
uh,

2124
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:55,420
I mean Carrie pcs completely out of his 
fucking lie.

2125
01:27:55,490 --> 01:27:56,323
But Gary Busey as an excuse.
Gary Busey got in a motorcycle accident 

2126
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:02,420
with no helmet and caved his head in 
like real bad.

2127
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:05,000
That's why Gary Busey,
when you're looking at one eyes up here,

2128
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,220
he's got that Shannon Shannon Doherty 
thing going on.

2129
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:09,140
Oh,
it's down here when I was up there.

2130
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:13,730
It's because it's literal skull was 
destroyed in a motorcycle accident.

2131
01:28:13,731 --> 01:28:16,160
He hit a fucking curb with his hedge,
right?

2132
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:20,080
Yeah.
And seeing that picture,

2133
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:23,060
if his eyebrows are up,
it makes it look like he's okay.

2134
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,940
But I'm getting to the one on our right.
His left is the one that drew.

2135
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:29,030
That's what it looks like is left as 
Jack.

2136
01:28:29,031 --> 01:28:29,864
But he,
we've had him in a couple of times when 

2137
01:28:30,561 --> 01:28:31,840
he came back in,
he remembered my.

2138
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,620
I thought like,
he's loopy,

2139
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:35,960
but he's not like,
out of it.

2140
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:37,431
Like,
yeah,

2141
01:28:37,431 --> 01:28:38,900
he knew.
I mean he wasn't.

2142
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:41,600
He's a little nutty,
but he's always been a little nutty.

2143
01:28:41,601 --> 01:28:42,770
But he didn't know.
He remembers lying.

2144
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:43,640
He can,
he can act.

2145
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,560
Yeah.
See how his right eyebrows up?

2146
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:46,830
Yeah.
Right.

2147
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:48,170
Eyes up and left.
One's down.

2148
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,980
Yeah.
He had a significant brain injury.

2149
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

2150
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:55,100
There it is.
Oh yeah.

2151
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:57,470
Before that,
before that accident,

2152
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,120
he was a pretty normal guy.
He has that injury.

2153
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:01,200
That's fucking TB.

2154
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:02,730
They already called Tbi.
Traumatic brain.

2155
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,890
That fucking wide open.
Look at you again.

2156
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:06,780
Will you see guys are both eyes like 
that?

2157
01:29:06,781 --> 01:29:07,830
They're fucking cooked.
Well,

2158
01:29:07,831 --> 01:29:08,664
there's a little bit of that,
but I believe there's structural damage 

2159
01:29:10,741 --> 01:29:12,820
to his actual skull itself.
I think I'm.

2160
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:15,690
I'm.
I'm almost positive that he hit the curb

2161
01:29:15,691 --> 01:29:16,524
without a helmet is when la didn't have 
helmet laws and he wiped out and curbed 

2162
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:25,230
is fucking brain and was lucky to be 
alive,

2163
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:26,560
if I remember correctly.
Yeah.

2164
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:27,720
I don't remember when that was,
but.

2165
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,730
Oh fuck motorcycles,
man.

2166
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:30,630
They scare me.
They,

2167
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:31,464
I watched all this website I go to.
I watch a lot of terrible things that I 

2168
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,284
shouldn't watch,
but I fucking seen these motorcycle 

2169
01:29:36,901 --> 01:29:37,734
accidents.
I'll always watch and car accidents 

2170
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:41,340
because that really does remind me to 
drive safe.

2171
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:44,520
Like you can't control everything,
but when I say guy burning to death in a

2172
01:29:44,521 --> 01:29:46,620
car or fucking cut in half,
I'm like,

2173
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,300
maybe it's not his fault.

2174
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:50,490
Oh yeah.
He went under a tractor trailer.

2175
01:29:50,491 --> 01:29:52,620
He was texting and driving and that's 
what it looks like.

2176
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:55,410
Don't fucking do it.
So I'm really,

2177
01:29:55,411 --> 01:29:58,590
really cautious when I drive I by Les.
We drove in your Porsche.

2178
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:00,870
Last one we did if I can pay and I was 
like,

2179
01:30:00,871 --> 01:30:02,730
wow,
you're a responsible porsche driver.

2180
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:04,040
Like you don't drive like an animal at 
all.

2181
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:04,903
No.
All you have pretty much around the 

2182
01:30:05,821 --> 01:30:06,780
limit.
Maybe a little over.

2183
01:30:06,781 --> 01:30:08,400
But you weren't a fucking maniac?
No,

2184
01:30:08,401 --> 01:30:09,234
I don't drive fast.
I would never drive fast with a friend 

2185
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:11,580
of the car either.
I don't.

2186
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,473
I'm not a dickhead driver.
Occasionally I've dickhead moments for 

2187
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:18,000
when no one's around,
but I don't.

2188
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:19,970
I don't put anybody else in danger.
I don't.

2189
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,500
I don't believe in driving like that.
No.

2190
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:24,240
It was a delightful Dr.
it was not frightening at all.

2191
01:30:24,241 --> 01:30:25,074
It was comfortable with it.

2192
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,330
You get nervous when you got into the 
car.

2193
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:28,140
I didn't know I've driven with you 
before,

2194
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:30,810
but if I didn't know you I might,
but just having a porsche,

2195
01:30:30,811 --> 01:30:31,644
it's just known as somebody who's going 
to move that car in particular because 

2196
01:30:34,411 --> 01:30:35,244
it's so loud and so bouncy and you know,
but I think you do a lot more to lose 

2197
01:30:39,331 --> 01:30:39,920
than I do.
So I'm like,

2198
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,250
I figured you'd be driving safe.
Like I'm like,

2199
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:44,610
it's not like you don't want to drive 
with the guy who has nothing.

2200
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,980
Like how you doing?
Oh I just lost my fucking house.

2201
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:52,310
I ain't got no gig and these two red 
lines getting the cat.

2202
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,233
I just put a new engine and so yeah,
you want to go with a guy who's got a 

2203
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,740
little bit more to lose than you do.
But it was safe.

2204
01:30:58,741 --> 01:30:59,310
Comfortable.
Right.

2205
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:00,143
Like those cars because they're light 
and the responsive and so it's like 

2206
01:31:02,761 --> 01:31:03,594
riding a ride,
like a Disneyland ride everywhere you 

2207
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:05,850
go.

2208
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:07,230
It doesn't,
I don't like,

2209
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:10,140
I don't want people.
How fast have you ever gotten it to?

2210
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:12,660
I've never gotten it that fast.
I don't drive that fast.

2211
01:31:12,661 --> 01:31:13,620
I don't,
I'm not.

2212
01:31:13,621 --> 01:31:14,454
I like cornering,
like I'm into cars that grip and feel 

2213
01:31:17,731 --> 01:31:18,531
good.
When you're,

2214
01:31:18,531 --> 01:31:19,050
you're,
you're,

2215
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:21,320
you're connected to the machine.
BMW.

2216
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:22,230
Drive like that.
Dumping.

2217
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:23,093
Sure.
Yeah.

2218
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:24,533
I had one.
This wheel is a kind of stiff and they 

2219
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:27,444
said that that's for.
It's because high performance encrypts 

2220
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:28,951
the road.
Well,

2221
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:31,350
they have a bunch of different settings 
you could put on a bmw,

2222
01:31:31,351 --> 01:31:33,300
especially the m cars.
They can make the,

2223
01:31:33,301 --> 01:31:34,134
you can vary the stiffnesses of the uh,
steering because they're a electronic 

2224
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:40,160
power assist.
But uh,

2225
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:40,970
the,
the,

2226
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:43,020
if you want a car that lists are really 
responsive.

2227
01:31:43,021 --> 01:31:45,100
That's a BMW.
They have an m two.

2228
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:47,860
It's a tiny little car.
It's like one of their least,

2229
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:49,193
least expensive m cars,
but most enthusiastic it's their best 

2230
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:52,920
one.

2231
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:53,590
I don't,
I don't,

2232
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:54,330
I've driven.
I had,

2233
01:31:54,330 --> 01:31:55,260
you know,
had the XX.

2234
01:31:55,261 --> 01:31:57,810
I drove like three in a row.
I was leasing them.

2235
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:00,160
They were really big cars and I was 
like,

2236
01:32:00,161 --> 01:32:00,994
I want,
I kind of wanted a Mercedes or a lot 

2237
01:32:02,261 --> 01:32:03,094
cheaper.
I've never driven over selling fucking 

2238
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,070
Mercedes with cheaper.
This was a much cheaper,

2239
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:09,580
much cheaper.
The BMW is just too big.

2240
01:32:09,581 --> 01:32:11,920
I live in the city,
I have a car because I like to drive.

2241
01:32:11,921 --> 01:32:13,750
It's like for what?
My addiction.

2242
01:32:13,751 --> 01:32:14,584
If I said I kept that because years ago 
I would ride around and look at fucking 

2243
01:32:17,411 --> 01:32:18,460
hookers.
That was.

2244
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:21,640
Yes,
that was why I did,

2245
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:24,940
but I might've been.
I might've been doing that now.

2246
01:32:24,941 --> 01:32:27,850
Like I'm totally out of that.
The actual cruising,

2247
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:29,640
the pay pay and people.
Yeah.

2248
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:30,563
Yeah.
I know.

2249
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:31,463
I pay pal for dirty videos sometimes in 
movies of girls who are doing things 

2250
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,040
just because you know what I mean,
but just paying for sex.

2251
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:38,680
The sex trafficking shit just freaked me
out too much.

2252
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:39,460
Oh,
that's awful.

2253
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:42,250
It freaked me out too much and I know 
I'm all for consensual,

2254
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:43,850
like women,
like I,

2255
01:32:43,851 --> 01:32:47,310
I talked to a woman once who was a.
she's,

2256
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:49,970
I guess you could say she was an escort.
She had,

2257
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:54,670
she had done porn and she stopped doing 
porn and she said the way she said it,

2258
01:32:54,671 --> 01:32:57,760
she likes,
she said she had clients and I was like,

2259
01:32:57,761 --> 01:32:59,620
well how does that work?
And she's like,

2260
01:32:59,621 --> 01:33:00,454
well off the record there's a bunch of 
guys that I've had sex with in the past 

2261
01:33:04,991 --> 01:33:05,824
and I liked them and they pay me and 
I'll go over there and it's almost like 

2262
01:33:09,191 --> 01:33:11,610
people I really like and I have sex with
them and I said like,

2263
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:12,880
how many times a week?
She goes,

2264
01:33:12,881 --> 01:33:14,980
I only need to do it a few times a week 
and I pay my bills,

2265
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,260
you know,
girls like that.

2266
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:18,093
After I stopped going on certain sites,
girls like that who I knew it was 

2267
01:33:21,491 --> 01:33:22,990
important me,
like I knew their lives,

2268
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:26,350
who they were under their real names.
I knew their facebook,

2269
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:27,213
like you know what a person's life is 
and they're just choosing to do this on 

2270
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:30,034
the side because a,
you have a chemistry with them and they 

2271
01:33:31,211 --> 01:33:34,060
like you and be they.
Some of them are just dirty.

2272
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:36,040
I've met plenty of just dirty and enjoy 
it.

2273
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:36,963
Well,
I didn't know her too well and I didn't 

2274
01:33:37,901 --> 01:33:40,660
ask too many questions,
but from what she was saying,

2275
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:43,090
it was essentially like,
you know,

2276
01:33:43,091 --> 01:33:43,924
she had done porn,
she didn't want to do porn anymore and 

2277
01:33:45,491 --> 01:33:47,800
she didn't want to be just a quote 
unquote hooker,

2278
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:53,010
but she had a few guys that wanted to 
have sex and would be willing to pay her

2279
01:33:53,231 --> 01:33:54,064
and I guess they apparently a couple 
thousand bucks and she would just have 

2280
01:33:56,321 --> 01:33:58,030
sex with these guys a couple times a 
week,

2281
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:00,610
different guys and she'd make four or 
$5,000

2282
01:34:00,611 --> 01:34:02,770
a week and she wouldn't have to worry 
about shit and she could do whatever she

2283
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:05,180
wanted to do for as long as my body 
holds up.

2284
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:08,470
I mean when I talked to this quite a 
long time ago,

2285
01:34:08,471 --> 01:34:11,410
I think she was probably like 36 or 37 
at the time,

2286
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:13,960
so it's like maybe she can't do that 
anymore.

2287
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:17,840
Maybe now she's 46,
47 or 50 and maybe dudes will.

2288
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,560
How much they try to find an older sugar
daddy,

2289
01:34:20,561 --> 01:34:21,760
I think,
or a guy that they've stayed.

2290
01:34:21,761 --> 01:34:22,594
That's where they start.
That's probably when they want to wife 

2291
01:34:23,261 --> 01:34:24,660
up to like when you're.
Yeah.

2292
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:25,683
That's a hard thing for men.
Like a lot of men do not want to shack 

2293
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:31,750
up with a chick that had sex for money.
You know,

2294
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,760
I don't mind it.
Like I don't want them doing it when I'm

2295
01:34:33,761 --> 01:34:35,890
with them,
but I like somebody with the past.

2296
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,290
I really need it because my past is so 
fucked up.

2297
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:41,170
I much prefer yours as to what the fuck 
is this Jamie?

2298
01:34:41,171 --> 01:34:44,710
The Korean grandmothers or sell sex?
How do you pull these up so quick?

2299
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:48,850
What do you have on tab?
Like what is wrong with you?

2300
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:49,953
I saw this story the other day.
I don't remember as a video about the 

2301
01:34:52,121 --> 01:34:53,680
box.
It's called Baucus ladies,

2302
01:34:53,681 --> 01:34:54,514
I believe it's a drink called Baka.
So they walk around selling the baucus 

2303
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:58,220
as an energy

2304
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,053
drink to a step.
Like there were like 40 and 50 year old 

2305
01:35:02,361 --> 01:35:03,194
women,
but now they're elderly women are doing 

2306
01:35:04,161 --> 01:35:04,994
it too and so you buy the drink but 
you're buying sex is what you're 

2307
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:09,170
reading.
What it says.

2308
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:10,730
I don't understand the way around the 
loophole.

2309
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:12,140
A loophole,
prostituted,

2310
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:13,213
you buy this drink and I'll give you sex
or like street vendors with energy 

2311
01:35:15,981 --> 01:35:17,720
drinks,
but when you buy it from them,

2312
01:35:17,721 --> 01:35:18,710
you're really saying,
hey,

2313
01:35:18,711 --> 01:35:19,544
come with me somewhere.
I guess where is this happening on 

2314
01:35:22,161 --> 01:35:23,290
Korea?
South Korea.

2315
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:24,753
Pretty smart work around.
So the guys by the energy drink knowing 

2316
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:30,620
that they're gonna get some sex.
That's what the video described.

2317
01:35:30,621 --> 01:35:31,200
Yeah,

2318
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,080
technically is a,
but I just,

2319
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:38,730
I've known too many people I've known 
who were like pseudo forced into it by a

2320
01:35:38,731 --> 01:35:42,450
boyfriend and one girl I was talking to 
recently was the industry like yeah,

2321
01:35:42,451 --> 01:35:45,300
my boyfriend had made me kind of do it 
and she got wanted to at one point,

2322
01:35:45,301 --> 01:35:47,940
but then he hit me when I didn't want.
I'm asleep man.

2323
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:50,160
There's too many people.
I don't know their story.

2324
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:52,350
If I can guarantee there's just 
consensual,

2325
01:35:52,351 --> 01:35:54,150
I'm fine with it being legal,
I don't care.

2326
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:55,373
But it freaked me out that there was too
many people that I didn't know enough 

2327
01:35:57,721 --> 01:35:59,520
about.
Like I never go to places.

2328
01:35:59,521 --> 01:36:00,354
I never went to those places because 
they felt too much like the Russian mob 

2329
01:36:02,041 --> 01:36:04,470
or the Asian,
whatever it was controlling them,

2330
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,660
but then even people I thought I knew,
I'm like,

2331
01:36:06,690 --> 01:36:08,880
I can't guarantee it and I can't.

2332
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:09,743
Well that's very ethical of you.
Like you were thinking about them being 

2333
01:36:11,581 --> 01:36:12,414
forced into that life over time.
It just got to me because more like I 

2334
01:36:15,481 --> 01:36:17,820
would talk to different people and at 
first it was like,

2335
01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:18,721
Eh,
the feminist.

2336
01:36:18,721 --> 01:36:19,554
Of course they're going to say that,
but then there was certain people that 

2337
01:36:21,001 --> 01:36:22,620
said certain things that someone just 
says something.

2338
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,513
See there's some feminists that think 
it's empowering for a woman to be able 

2339
01:36:27,751 --> 01:36:30,390
to choose what to do with her body.
I know,

2340
01:36:30,391 --> 01:36:31,224
I know a woman who's a very smart woman 
and when she was younger she had done 

2341
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:34,703
and she's an artist.
She had done some sex work but it was 

2342
01:36:37,561 --> 01:36:41,700
just like she fucked some guys for money
and like for her it was like easier than

2343
01:36:41,701 --> 01:36:42,650
working.
Yeah.

2344
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:44,610
And I'm not saying I think it should be 
legalized.

2345
01:36:44,611 --> 01:36:46,260
I think that people should be able to do
that.

2346
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:49,890
I just personally,
as I was getting older and I'm like,

2347
01:36:49,891 --> 01:36:52,180
this is not what I want to do anymore.
I think boring.

2348
01:36:52,650 --> 01:36:54,210
Well it's also,
you know,

2349
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:55,133
it just anytime someone's being forced 
to do something and then there's 

2350
01:36:58,621 --> 01:36:59,454
potential shame attached to it.
Like I don't think there's anything 

2351
01:37:00,931 --> 01:37:02,550
wrong with sex and I don't know.
You don't either,

2352
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:06,840
but when you attach the potential 
societal shame aspect of it,

2353
01:37:06,841 --> 01:37:07,674
like your behavior,
your choices could shame you can be a 

2354
01:37:10,171 --> 01:37:11,300
real problem.
You know,

2355
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:12,630
like the same thing with sex,
right?

2356
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:14,570
Like people having sex.
Who Care?

2357
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:16,620
Everybody have sex.
We'd love sex people.

2358
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:18,660
Most people love sex,
right?

2359
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:19,703
But the idea of you being caught on film
having sex is terrifying for a lot of 

2360
01:37:23,491 --> 01:37:25,560
people,
which is really weird.

2361
01:37:25,950 --> 01:37:28,590
It's really weird.
Like we know you love sex,

2362
01:37:28,591 --> 01:37:30,210
but if we see you having sex,
well,

2363
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:31,460
shame.
Yeah,

2364
01:37:31,461 --> 01:37:32,610
it's a really.
You're right,

2365
01:37:32,611 --> 01:37:36,570
because it's almost like this why I hate
when people break into these hard drives

2366
01:37:36,571 --> 01:37:39,480
in the cloud for these celebrities 
because it's a weird privacy thing.

2367
01:37:39,481 --> 01:37:41,490
Like even if you're not doing something 
you're not supposed to have.

2368
01:37:41,491 --> 01:37:43,080
You talked to your wife,
you talked to your girlfriend,

2369
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:47,430
who wants people hearing that it's 
embarrassing and it's private.

2370
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:48,420
I'm,
look,

2371
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:51,060
I'm very open about most things sexually
in my life,

2372
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:52,283
but I still don't want people to read 
specific things I've said because it 

2373
01:37:54,361 --> 01:37:56,140
just feels like invasion of privacy

2374
01:37:56,150 --> 01:38:00,480
page and it's also like you didn't write
it for other people to hear and there's.

2375
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:03,390
There's things you say to your friends,
right,

2376
01:38:03,391 --> 01:38:05,430
that if they took out of context,
people would go,

2377
01:38:05,431 --> 01:38:07,920
well Jim Norton's a fucking asshole.
He's a piece of shit.

2378
01:38:07,921 --> 01:38:10,950
Like,
like even in just like this thing that I

2379
01:38:10,951 --> 01:38:15,951
did with Ari sent him a text message 
that I put it on instagram is Avi.

2380
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:18,780
I thought it pretty obvious that it was 
in jest,

2381
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:19,703
but so many people thought it was really
like the context of your friendship and 

2382
01:38:22,891 --> 01:38:24,810
people who don't understand they don't 
know you.

2383
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:27,210
And then there's also the comedian 
factor.

2384
01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:28,163
Like the way we talk to each other on a 
regular basis is so different than the 

2385
01:38:31,111 --> 01:38:31,944
way a lot of folks can because if you're
working in an office job nine to five 

2386
01:38:36,571 --> 01:38:39,730
every day you're controlled by human 
resources and the the,

2387
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:42,760
the,
the office standards of behavior.

2388
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:43,793
You have to follow some sort of a firing
guidelines of what's term to what you 

2389
01:38:48,331 --> 01:38:49,164
can get terminated for those people are 
on the edge and tiptoeing on fucking 

2390
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:55,530
broken glass every day.

2391
01:38:55,570 --> 01:39:00,570
It's scary and you know is Sirius Xm is 
a corporate environment and I'm fucking.

2392
01:39:01,001 --> 01:39:05,260
I'm a fucking dirty comic and I'm more 
careful around the women there than half

2393
01:39:05,261 --> 01:39:06,920
of the fucking newscasters.
You hear about getting.

2394
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,440
It's like if I know that as a fucking 
dirt bag,

2395
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,910
you don't fucking hit on the women at 
work.

2396
01:39:12,630 --> 01:39:15,700
Ask them gently,
did we talk about now okay and fuck off.

2397
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:18,800
Well not even worse,
but these guys weren't just doing that.

2398
01:39:18,801 --> 01:39:20,890
They were sexually harassed.
Absolutely.

2399
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:22,940
It's crazy.
It's not that they were hitting on him.

2400
01:39:22,941 --> 01:39:25,280
I mean,
office environments are just Whitney.

2401
01:39:25,490 --> 01:39:27,230
Cummings is a very funny joke about 
that.

2402
01:39:27,231 --> 01:39:28,064
I don't want to say it because it's,
it's one of her new bits about working 

2403
01:39:29,961 --> 01:39:30,794
in an office,
but there's so much sexual tension when 

2404
01:39:34,101 --> 01:39:34,934
you're stuck in a room with people for 
eight hours a day and if two people are 

2405
01:39:37,611 --> 01:39:40,580
attracted to each other and they're 
working side by side on a daily basis,

2406
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:41,623
occasionally they test the waters and 
say fucked up things and then saying 

2407
01:39:44,151 --> 01:39:44,984
those fucked up things.
Women are allowed to do whatever they 

2408
01:39:45,921 --> 01:39:47,990
want essentially.
Like it's really hard.

2409
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:49,370
It's really hard for her to get fired.
Yeah.

2410
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:51,650
I mean a woman says something dirty you.
It's kind of funny,

2411
01:39:51,651 --> 01:39:53,870
but if a guy says something unwanted and
dirty,

2412
01:39:53,871 --> 01:39:56,090
it's really disgusting because why?
Well,

2413
01:39:56,091 --> 01:39:56,924
because men rape in,
they're more dangerous and they're 

2414
01:39:58,551 --> 01:39:59,680
scarier.
You know,

2415
01:39:59,690 --> 01:40:00,523
they're physically more scary.
So a guy intruding on a woman's space 

2416
01:40:04,191 --> 01:40:05,024
and saying creepy,
unwanted sexual shit has an air of 

2417
01:40:07,641 --> 01:40:11,180
danger to it.
Whereas if a girl is saying some creepy,

2418
01:40:11,330 --> 01:40:13,460
unwanted sexual shit to me,
I can go,

2419
01:40:13,461 --> 01:40:14,480
hey,
stop.

2420
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:17,450
You know,
like you can't say don't talk to them.

2421
01:40:17,470 --> 01:40:20,140
Like precursor to her making you do it.
Yeah.

2422
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:21,640
It's never,
she's going to grab my head,

2423
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:23,170
forced me to eat her pussy.
Yeah.

2424
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,750
Great thought though,
isn't being made to do it.

2425
01:40:25,751 --> 01:40:30,050
That's one of my greatest being made to 
be made.

2426
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:35,250
Stick your tongue up further.
Sniff it.

2427
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:39,510
Fart in your mouth.
Yeah,

2428
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,550
we've all been there.
You ever have someone do that?

2429
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:44,380
I'd have it.
It was all right.

2430
01:40:44,650 --> 01:40:45,540
Not Bad.
Not that.

2431
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,620
No.
I had a girl and I didn't go.

2432
01:40:47,621 --> 01:40:48,454
And did I tell you this?
She's trying to push a fart out and she 

2433
01:40:49,841 --> 01:40:51,970
shot monistat seven on my chest.
Oh,

2434
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,033
it was fucking monistat seven is 
something girls putting their vagina 

2435
01:40:55,721 --> 01:40:56,620
infection.
Oh,

2436
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:59,530
Jesus is not my best moment.
Would it smell like?

2437
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:03,550
I don't believe it had a smell.
I don't remember having a smell.

2438
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:06,580
You had to explain that it was Monistat 
so exactly what it was.

2439
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:09,970
We both knew what it was.
You know?

2440
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,060
It was a bad.
It was a bad scene,

2441
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,670
but she was really fucking sexy.

2442
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:17,630
Big Fat ass.
Yeah.

2443
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:19,330
Just trying to Fart on you.
Yeah,

2444
01:41:19,331 --> 01:41:20,164
just take.
I mean,

2445
01:41:20,210 --> 01:41:21,490
I don't really care about that,
but I was like,

2446
01:41:21,491 --> 01:41:22,160
yeah,
why not?

2447
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:24,230
Quite my face.
That's whose idea was it?

2448
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:26,470
Mine,
but I think she said I have to.

2449
01:41:26,471 --> 01:41:26,980
I'm like,
go ahead.

2450
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:28,600
What are you already said you have to 
you?

2451
01:41:28,620 --> 01:41:29,280
She said,
no,

2452
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,640
no,
I think she said I have to Fart.

2453
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,200
Oh,
she said I have to Fart.

2454
01:41:32,430 --> 01:41:33,250
Fart in my mouth.
Yeah.

2455
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:34,083
We had always done that.
Besides did licked her ass and she's 

2456
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:36,970
great at.
You know what I mean?

2457
01:41:36,971 --> 01:41:40,590
We were kind of far from that.
Nah,

2458
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:42,773
not that I know of.
Somebody must have terrible way to feel 

2459
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:48,100
like,
why didn't I just shower up first?

2460
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:50,230
I don't like to shower them up first.
I don't like the.

2461
01:41:50,231 --> 01:41:51,850
I like this.
I like a scent.

2462
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:53,350
I literally like.

2463
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:56,080
You liked that you liked sheep?
I liked them.

2464
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,500
I was telling you like,
I'll tell her like if I'm dating you and

2465
01:41:59,501 --> 01:42:01,960
I like you,
I literally have thrown girlfriends,

2466
01:42:01,961 --> 01:42:03,630
deodorants out.
Really?

2467
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:05,740
I fucking do.
You want them to stink a little?

2468
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:06,603
Yes,
but I have to fucking way you're saying 

2469
01:42:10,991 --> 01:42:12,880
it,
but I have to like them.

2470
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:14,020
Oh,
it has to be.

2471
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:16,120
It's a chemistry thing.
That's nature telling you who you should

2472
01:42:16,121 --> 01:42:19,240
fucking who you shouldn't fuck,
because some people sent repulses me the

2473
01:42:19,241 --> 01:42:22,210
smell of their mouth or the smell of 
their skin repulses me,

2474
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:23,403
unhealthy people probably.
Or even people that I'm just not meant 

2475
01:42:25,571 --> 01:42:27,550
to breed with.
But then there's some people,

2476
01:42:27,551 --> 01:42:30,070
the underarm smell the smell of their 
feet when they're stinky.

2477
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:32,680
Dude,
it makes me not dirty.

2478
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:33,693
I don't like dirty feet.
Like I don't want you to talk a little 

2479
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:37,270
stinky in socks and sneakers because 
clean.

2480
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:41,110
There's a whole fucking thing of it 
here.

2481
01:42:41,140 --> 01:42:42,880
So orderly,
but clean.

2482
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:44,800
It is intense.
Your eyes,

2483
01:42:45,610 --> 01:42:46,141
you're like,
no,

2484
01:42:46,141 --> 01:42:46,311
no,
no,

2485
01:42:46,311 --> 01:42:47,144
no socks and sneakers because it's clean
because you do feel like a creep when 

2486
01:42:49,211 --> 01:42:51,070
you're talking to a girl and you say to 
her like,

2487
01:42:51,071 --> 01:42:53,680
I want your feet to be a certain way I 
would say,

2488
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:55,750
but you want to let her know,
don't make them dirty.

2489
01:42:55,751 --> 01:42:58,990
Like don't come over and flip flops or I
don't want you walking around on a,

2490
01:42:58,991 --> 01:43:00,340
on a,
on a floor without.

2491
01:43:00,450 --> 01:43:01,290
You know what I mean?
Like I like,

2492
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,790
I'm a hygiene person.
Sweaty.

2493
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:05,280
Yeah.
But um,

2494
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:06,910
I've been with that with girls.
I tell them like,

2495
01:43:06,911 --> 01:43:08,930
don't shower for three days.
Oh,

2496
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:11,410
Jesus makes me crazy.
And what do they say?

2497
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:13,510
Great.
Really the good ones,

2498
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:15,370
this is great.
Honestly,

2499
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,690
they fucking love it.
Um,

2500
01:43:17,050 --> 01:43:17,980
but again,
if I don't like you,

2501
01:43:17,981 --> 01:43:20,530
if I'm not attracted to your San,
I have no desire for that.

2502
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:22,270
So that's how I know I meant to be with 
somebody.

2503
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:23,410
You know,
Chris Ryan,

2504
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:24,273
Dr Chris Ryan,
who was a friend of mine was telling me 

2505
01:43:25,991 --> 01:43:29,080
that women,
when they're on birth control pills,

2506
01:43:29,410 --> 01:43:30,243
their ability to smell whether or not a 
mate is sexually compatible with them 

2507
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:37,450
gets hindered by the birth control pill.
It fucks it up.

2508
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:40,510
But when they have women that are not on
birth control pills,

2509
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:41,493
they can literally smell a man's clothes
and find out whether or not they're 

2510
01:43:44,441 --> 01:43:47,410
sexually compatible with them.
Just whether or not they're attracted to

2511
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:48,253
them.
Like there's a literally a specific 

2512
01:43:50,051 --> 01:43:51,830
scent and that sent

2513
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:56,030
they think is not just like whether or 
not you're sexually attracted to someone

2514
01:43:56,031 --> 01:43:56,864
smell,
but whether or not you're biologically 

2515
01:43:58,221 --> 01:43:59,054
compatible with them.
Like do you remember back in the day 

2516
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:04,520
when people would get married,
they would do blood tests to see if they

2517
01:44:04,521 --> 01:44:06,640
could have kids remember that?
I don't.

2518
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:08,780
There was a thing that they used to talk
about,

2519
01:44:08,781 --> 01:44:12,230
like people would have tests to see it.
I don't know if,

2520
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,073
you know,
it was legitimately scientifically 

2521
01:44:14,121 --> 01:44:14,954
valid,
but they would have tests like a blood 

2522
01:44:16,521 --> 01:44:20,720
test and I remember people talking about
this when I was in high school like that

2523
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:21,554
married people would have go and have 
these blood tests to see if they could 

2524
01:44:24,621 --> 01:44:25,790
not,
not pregnancy.

2525
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:26,601
Oh No,
no,

2526
01:44:26,601 --> 01:44:27,560
no,
not pregnancy,

2527
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:28,663
but whether or not they were compatible.
Like as far as like raising healthy 

2528
01:44:33,171 --> 01:44:34,940
kids.
There was some weird.

2529
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:40,150
I mean it might've been some bullshit 
fake science that they tried to pass off

2530
01:44:40,581 --> 01:44:41,414
back in the seventies and the eighties,
but I distinctly remember people 

2531
01:44:44,571 --> 01:44:45,404
talking.

2532
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:49,910
This is like before I was anywhere near 
blood typing compatibility.

2533
01:44:49,911 --> 01:44:52,250
Yeah.
Blood types of categorized by a,

2534
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:53,084
B and o.
we're reading something here and given 

2535
01:44:55,101 --> 01:44:59,950
the rh factor of positive or negative,
Abo and rh in compatibility happens when

2536
01:44:59,951 --> 01:45:03,440
a mother's blood type conflicts with 
that of a newborn child.

2537
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:04,423
It's possible for the mothers red blood 
cells to cross into the placenta or 

2538
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:10,280
fetus during pregnancy.
Yeah,

2539
01:45:10,281 --> 01:45:11,114
but that's.
I'm incompatibilities between a mother 

2540
01:45:12,351 --> 01:45:13,184
and a child.
I think it's between a man and a woman 

2541
01:45:15,801 --> 01:45:19,430
and the way they have theirs is probably
bullshit,

2542
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,520
but it was something that people used to
do a lot.

2543
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:23,383
I remember people talking about it.
I remember people talking about it when 

2544
01:45:26,181 --> 01:45:28,760
I had a very,
very limited understanding of biology,

2545
01:45:28,761 --> 01:45:31,340
so I was probably in high school and 
even before that,

2546
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:33,170
but I was like,
what blood tests?

2547
01:45:33,171 --> 01:45:34,550
They have to take a blood test.
I'm like,

2548
01:45:34,551 --> 01:45:36,620
what if you love somebody and you want 
to get married to them?

2549
01:45:36,621 --> 01:45:38,930
You find out that you take a blood test 
and it doesn't work out.

2550
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:39,823
Like how does that work?

2551
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:42,100
Maybe the worker,
maybe that's such a nature thing.

2552
01:45:42,101 --> 01:45:45,040
Like maybe if it's not meant to be,
it can still work.

2553
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:45,941
Like,
you know what I mean?

2554
01:45:45,941 --> 01:45:48,030
Nature may work on this fucking base 
level.

2555
01:45:48,031 --> 01:45:49,090
Well yeah,
it's still going to work,

2556
01:45:49,091 --> 01:45:50,710
but that's like letting you know,
it will work.

2557
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:51,611
Like,
do you know what I mean?

2558
01:45:51,611 --> 01:45:53,920
It may still work fine if you're sent is
off,

2559
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:55,690
but they're closed.
Thing makes sense.

2560
01:45:55,691 --> 01:45:58,810
There was a girl I had come over.
She would come over and mood fuck around

2561
01:45:58,990 --> 01:45:59,823
and she wouldn't.
Her underarms with smell and it made me 

2562
01:46:01,151 --> 01:46:02,320
fucking bonkers,
man.

2563
01:46:02,321 --> 01:46:06,340
I was so attracted to her since she left
a jacket in my house,

2564
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:09,100
the fucking armpit.
I smelled the armpits for six months.

2565
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:13,630
You're so fucked up.
It's dude.

2566
01:46:13,631 --> 01:46:18,631
I fucking sniffed the armpit and I'm not
a guy who's into toys or clothing.

2567
01:46:19,781 --> 01:46:22,270
Like as far as a woman,
I don't usually want their panties.

2568
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:24,580
I'm the girl I'm seeing now.
I do though.

2569
01:46:24,610 --> 01:46:26,860
I do want to.
We're trying to figure out a way for her

2570
01:46:26,861 --> 01:46:27,694
to fedex overnight and your panties.
I've never asked to go do that my life 

2571
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:32,740
ever tell her to put them in a Ziploc.
Of course,

2572
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,760
of course,
of course.

2573
01:46:33,761 --> 01:46:35,560
That was number.
Want me to tell him to tape the zip lock

2574
01:46:35,561 --> 01:46:36,940
so it doesn't open up?
Yes,

2575
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:39,460
but I mean that's really ultra rare that
I actually want that.

2576
01:46:39,730 --> 01:46:42,330
But this girl's jacket hung in my closet
and I fucking smelled.

2577
01:46:42,331 --> 01:46:45,040
That drove me crazy for months.
I'm having Deja Vu.

2578
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:46,380
Losing today's

2579
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:50,010
parents says that you should be getting 
blood tests for screening because

2580
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:53,220
they can find out if they're going to 
have potential blood diseases and stuff.

2581
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:54,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

2582
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:56,460
But that's.
Today's parent is at a website.

2583
01:46:56,490 --> 01:46:57,570
Yeah.
Who's that knows?

2584
01:46:57,571 --> 01:46:59,880
Is that a common practice?
That's what I mean.

2585
01:46:59,881 --> 01:47:00,600
It says,
uh,

2586
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:01,433
this was like an article that says test 
you need to be getting before pregnancy 

2587
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:07,500
and there's like a pre pregnancy checkup
for the man and the woman,

2588
01:47:07,501 --> 01:47:08,334
right.
Prenatal vaccinations and then sexually 

2589
01:47:09,421 --> 01:47:10,254
transmitted diseases,
you need to check for it to end genetic 

2590
01:47:12,031 --> 01:47:12,864
screening.
It says so they just do like probably 

2591
01:47:13,641 --> 01:47:16,180
overall blood tests.
It's very interesting.

2592
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,900
[inaudible] you don't hear about that 
anymore.

2593
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:19,730
It's not like,
you know,

2594
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:22,340
I,
you don't hear about that from doctors.

2595
01:47:22,341 --> 01:47:24,200
You don't hear about that when people 
were trying to get pregnant.

2596
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:26,450
You don't hear about that from 
newlyweds.

2597
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:28,430
Just don't hear about it.
The blood tests.

2598
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:29,293
Yeah,
like getting blood tests to make sure 

2599
01:47:30,171 --> 01:47:31,004
that your kids would be healthy or I 
wonder now though if there's so much 

2600
01:47:33,201 --> 01:47:34,034
stress put on disease shit like aids the
day we still say get a blood test and 

2601
01:47:37,461 --> 01:47:39,440
get tested and all this stuff is 
handled,

2602
01:47:39,650 --> 01:47:40,483
but maybe we just don't talk about the 
other aspect of it because the big one 

2603
01:47:42,621 --> 01:47:44,540
is HIV or whatever or hey,
like,

2604
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:45,374
you know,
get you had to check to see what 

2605
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:49,640
diseases you're family has.
Like maybe we're still talking about it,

2606
01:47:49,641 --> 01:47:51,200
but it's just not being phrased the same
way.

2607
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:52,213
This is why I don't think it's true 
because we went to a very good doctor 

2608
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:55,980
and you know,
I have,

2609
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:57,103
I have kids.

2610
01:47:57,470 --> 01:48:00,440
I never took a fucking test.
The shot loads in there and made kids.

2611
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:03,310
He just alluded to it.
I mean I just don't.

2612
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:06,570
I don't know.
I mean maybe I dunno.

2613
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:08,053
I Dunno.
I Dunno about the science of all that 

2614
01:48:09,411 --> 01:48:11,300
stuff and I just don't know why it was 
never discussed,

2615
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:15,870
but I do remember being a kid where that
was a big deal like that a parent,

2616
01:48:16,030 --> 01:48:16,863
these two parents would get a blood test
before they got married and make sure 

2617
01:48:19,071 --> 01:48:21,530
they could have kids and it just never 
hear about that shit anymore.

2618
01:48:21,770 --> 01:48:22,603
Yeah.
I don't even remember hearing about it 

2619
01:48:23,541 --> 01:48:25,460
back then to be honest,
but it does make sense.

2620
01:48:25,461 --> 01:48:26,090
Like,
Hey,

2621
01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:26,923
let's just see if there's going to be 
like if there's an obvious problem that 

2622
01:48:29,061 --> 01:48:29,894
will show up through the blood test.
Well how fucking weird is it that you 

2623
01:48:31,761 --> 01:48:33,380
could have a different kind of blood in 
me?

2624
01:48:33,890 --> 01:48:36,290
Like your blood might be a in mind.
Might be,

2625
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,480
oh,
like your blood is in my body.

2626
01:48:38,481 --> 01:48:39,410
I'm fucked.
Yeah.

2627
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:41,750
I got to keep my body.
It's not even compatible.

2628
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:42,923
So that's what's so strange.
It's like we vary so much biologically 

2629
01:48:46,700 --> 01:48:50,360
that we have different kinds of blood 
and one is not good in the other.

2630
01:48:50,410 --> 01:48:51,243
Yeah,
I mean there's some bloods that are 

2631
01:48:52,401 --> 01:48:56,150
universal.
I believe it's o positive is a universal

2632
01:48:56,151 --> 01:48:58,460
blood donor and anyone can take it.
Yeah,

2633
01:48:58,760 --> 01:48:59,593
that's what I have.
I believe that my blood can go into 

2634
01:49:02,511 --> 01:49:05,420
other people's body and it's okay to 
find out if that's true.

2635
01:49:05,450 --> 01:49:07,400
I don't know what I am.
I probably should know.

2636
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:09,170
Yeah,
he's probably 50.

2637
01:49:09,190 --> 01:49:10,011
Jesus.
I know.

2638
01:49:10,011 --> 01:49:11,190
I'm busy.
I'm fucking.

2639
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:15,440
I didn't ever check that busy.
Just getting panty sent to me.

2640
01:49:15,490 --> 01:49:17,390
I know,
I know.

2641
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:19,370
I'm not really big on the undergarments 
though.

2642
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:20,293
I mean,
um,

2643
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:21,530
you know,
a couple girls have had them.

2644
01:49:21,531 --> 01:49:22,364
I thought there were sexy.
What is it about women wearing those 

2645
01:49:24,861 --> 01:49:25,694
stockings with the straps that go up to 
the underwear so hot because you're 

2646
01:49:29,001 --> 01:49:30,470
seeing something you're not supposed to 
be.

2647
01:49:31,010 --> 01:49:31,843
Real Universal.
Red Cell donor has type O negative o o 

2648
01:49:35,451 --> 01:49:37,250
negative.
I think I'm o positive.

2649
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:41,870
Universal plasma donor has ab blood type
R,

2650
01:49:41,871 --> 01:49:42,704
H in general.
Rh negative blood is giving to rh 

2651
01:49:45,741 --> 01:49:48,250
negative patients and rh blood or

2652
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:51,910
rh negative blood may be giving to rh 
positive patients.

2653
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:57,180
Universal red cell donor has type O,
o o negative blood type.

2654
01:49:58,010 --> 01:49:58,843
Mm.
Um,

2655
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:00,910
I need to figure out what I'm talking 
about.

2656
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:01,863
Yeah.
I don't know much about the blood stuff 

2657
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,200
at all.
I mean for me it's just a,

2658
01:50:04,370 --> 01:50:05,860
you know,
what drives me sexually,

2659
01:50:05,861 --> 01:50:07,640
like I know what I,
you know,

2660
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:08,703
like let's,
it is weird how some people can be like 

2661
01:50:10,301 --> 01:50:11,134
really pretty,
but you don't find them attractive at 

2662
01:50:12,281 --> 01:50:13,114
all.
And then other people not nearly as 

2663
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:16,120
pretty,
but you think they're so sexy.

2664
01:50:16,270 --> 01:50:19,750
I've dated people who will this trigger 
words that we all like,

2665
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:22,340
so a good trigger word,
poof,

2666
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:25,340
that goes a long way.
Like it's not the dirty porn words,

2667
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:26,253
you know what I mean?
You like that shit shut up now for me 

2668
01:50:28,571 --> 01:50:29,404
it's not,
it's not a series of words or that kind 

2669
01:50:31,091 --> 01:50:31,420
of shit.

2670
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:34,000
I'm not get not as dirty as you,
but uh,

2671
01:50:34,030 --> 01:50:37,780
for me it's just a personality thing 
that someone is comfortable,

2672
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:41,130
like someone is comfortable in their own
skin and fun to be around and,

2673
01:50:41,131 --> 01:50:44,530
and,
and I'm passionate,

2674
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:46,990
you know,
but also like affectionate,

2675
01:50:47,050 --> 01:50:50,290
like affectionate to me is very sexy.
So you have different things.

2676
01:50:50,291 --> 01:50:51,700
We all have those things.
I actually,

2677
01:50:51,701 --> 01:50:52,534
yours is better because to me that's a 
more normal thing to be and then just a 

2678
01:50:55,001 --> 01:50:59,420
healthier thing without needing bells 
and whistles and fucking juggling and,

2679
01:50:59,421 --> 01:51:02,410
and you know,
and to see a woman with perfect features

2680
01:51:02,411 --> 01:51:05,110
and she's cold and she's not friendly 
and nice.

2681
01:51:05,111 --> 01:51:06,490
I don't find her attractive at all.
Yeah.

2682
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:08,590
It does nothing for you to a woman who's
like way less,

2683
01:51:08,591 --> 01:51:09,424
like classically attractive,
but she's very affectionate and very 

2684
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:14,890
kind and sweet and fun to be around.
I find that very attractive.

2685
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:19,720
That will vary from person to person.
I can go with kind and sweet or I can go

2686
01:51:19,721 --> 01:51:21,910
with this certain words I like when they
say like,

2687
01:51:21,911 --> 01:51:25,270
some people just get it and they know 
how to talk and they know,

2688
01:51:25,271 --> 01:51:27,430
they know your fucking triggers and it's
just,

2689
01:51:28,030 --> 01:51:29,800
it's an ownership for you.
For me.

2690
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:30,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

2691
01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:32,320
You got weird kinks.
Yeah man.

2692
01:51:32,330 --> 01:51:34,090
It's all the night is crazy with this.
Again,

2693
01:51:34,091 --> 01:51:35,470
the personality,
not crazy.

2694
01:51:35,471 --> 01:51:37,500
I just like her or I love her.
Whatever the fuck.

2695
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:39,090
What is it though?
What do you do?

2696
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:41,560
Have you ever tried to examine like what
are kinks?

2697
01:51:41,561 --> 01:51:43,090
Like where is it coming from?
Like what,

2698
01:51:43,450 --> 01:51:44,283
what is it about like trigger words and 
weird things and weird stuff that like 

2699
01:51:47,621 --> 01:51:48,454
gets you turned on like w and w,
is it how you're interfacing with the 

2700
01:51:52,031 --> 01:51:55,300
world?
Is it how you're choosing to address all

2701
01:51:55,301 --> 01:51:56,134
of your issues and that you can escape 
them with like really like crazy 

2702
01:51:59,441 --> 01:52:00,274
behavior and that like maybe you have 
all these anxieties and neurosis and 

2703
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:08,290
that through this really bizarre dirty 
talk and freaky behavior.

2704
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:10,330
You can escape those because it's so 
naughty.

2705
01:52:10,570 --> 01:52:13,210
It's so off the [inaudible] you're not a
normal guy.

2706
01:52:13,211 --> 01:52:14,440
Right?
But none of us are.

2707
01:52:14,441 --> 01:52:17,230
If we're working in show business.
If you're a standup comedian,

2708
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:18,064
right?
You're getting paid to talk crazy shit 

2709
01:52:19,391 --> 01:52:21,880
on stage or you're not normal.
You're,

2710
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:24,140
your world is in normal.
You wake up whenever the fuck you want,

2711
01:52:24,141 --> 01:52:25,450
unless you have to do a radio show.
Right?

2712
01:52:25,930 --> 01:52:28,450
So it's a different.
The whole world you live in is different

2713
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:29,553
and then you have all this kinky shit 
and then you get added addictions to 

2714
01:52:32,351 --> 01:52:33,184
dirty stuff and so like whatever it is 
about like a girl saying something like 

2715
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:38,374
that,
she's going to go with me on this crazy 

2716
01:52:39,341 --> 01:52:40,660
dirty.
A fart in my mouth.

2717
01:52:40,661 --> 01:52:41,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

2718
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:45,680
It's like you're,
you're like escaping the troubles.

2719
01:52:45,681 --> 01:52:46,070
Just for

2720
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:49,280
a brief moment with all this insane 
behavior.

2721
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:52,230
It could be that and I don't know.
Sometimes I wonder like with.

2722
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:53,213
It's almost like if you eat too much ice
cream is diabetes that will come with 

2723
01:52:55,351 --> 01:52:57,120
that.
That could be the diabetes,

2724
01:52:57,121 --> 01:52:57,954
like just too much access and all of a 
sudden instead of three to make this 

2725
01:53:01,651 --> 01:53:02,790
effect,
it takes 11.

2726
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:03,833
It's just it.
You can't get the same effect from the 

2727
01:53:05,701 --> 01:53:07,680
same thing.
Like when I was growing up,

2728
01:53:07,681 --> 01:53:09,840
I loved lesbian porn.
I fucking love to girls.

2729
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,910
Oh my God.
It drove me nuts.

2730
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,830
Now place.
Are they related?

2731
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:14,880
No,
I'm not interested.

2732
01:53:15,110 --> 01:53:15,690
Does nothing that

2733
01:53:15,690 --> 01:53:18,180
killed it for me.
When I was on news radio,

2734
01:53:18,181 --> 01:53:20,820
one of the guys who was a writer on news
radio is a very nice guy,

2735
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:22,633
but he was a nebbishy sort of fellow 
that had problems with women and he was 

2736
01:53:28,501 --> 01:53:29,334
a writer on news radio and in his 
moonlight time you used a pseudonym and 

2737
01:53:32,971 --> 01:53:34,770
wrote for porn.
Oh.

2738
01:53:34,890 --> 01:53:38,040
And so he took me to a porn set is my 
first porn set ever.

2739
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:42,380
And it was Jill Kelly and Janine.
I'm sure you know who those Kelly.

2740
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:43,223
I know the name.
Janine and Janine is the one that used 

2741
01:53:44,281 --> 01:53:47,430
to be married to the Jesse James 
Character,

2742
01:53:47,431 --> 01:53:49,740
the biker guy.
Oh yes.

2743
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:50,613
Beautiful woman.
And her thing was that she only did a 

2744
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,810
lesbian porn.
That was her thing.

2745
01:53:54,890 --> 01:53:59,460
Right.
So I'm on the set and it was just so,

2746
01:54:01,080 --> 01:54:03,310
like clinical,
very,

2747
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:06,900
like it was weird like they were.
They were doing the scene.

2748
01:54:06,930 --> 01:54:07,763
Yeah,
that's her.

2749
01:54:07,830 --> 01:54:08,663
Yeah.
She was on a blinker on a Tuesday album 

2750
01:54:09,931 --> 01:54:11,430
cover.
It's a beautiful,

2751
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:12,520
beautiful woman.
Right.

2752
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:13,800
So she's,
um,

2753
01:54:14,220 --> 01:54:18,030
she's got this scene as lesbian.
I think she was like a cartoon character

2754
01:54:18,031 --> 01:54:20,100
that came back to life or some 
ridiculous shit.

2755
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:21,870
Right?
Is that what she looks like now?

2756
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:25,000
Oh Jesus.
Is that a um.

2757
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:28,350
Yeah,
but is that like a spa?

2758
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:31,170
That's a mug shot.
She went to jail.

2759
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:34,450
I forget what she went to jail for it.
But yeah,

2760
01:54:34,590 --> 01:54:35,423
not good.

2761
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:38,700
Anyway,
things go south,

2762
01:54:39,010 --> 01:54:39,843
right?
That's what we were talking about 

2763
01:54:39,991 --> 01:54:40,824
earlier.
Some of these gals that get a little 

2764
01:54:41,701 --> 01:54:44,760
older and all the pressure of the 
forbidden behavior,

2765
01:54:44,761 --> 01:54:45,594
just the societal pressure and all the 
things that lead them to be that way in 

2766
01:54:49,681 --> 01:54:51,510
the first place come crashing down on 
them.

2767
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:54,570
But for,
for this scene like there,

2768
01:54:54,690 --> 01:54:55,523
the two of them were on a bed and they 
were eating each other's pussies and 

2769
01:54:58,111 --> 01:54:59,190
there was like this,
uh,

2770
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:02,430
you know,
there was a sound guy with the fuzzy mic

2771
01:55:02,431 --> 01:55:04,290
that's on a stick that has hovered over 
him.

2772
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:05,363
And then there was a,
another guy that was over there doing 

2773
01:55:06,841 --> 01:55:08,790
something.
He was literally eating a sandwich where

2774
01:55:08,791 --> 01:55:09,624
these girls are eating pussy.
It's like he was so disinterested and 

2775
01:55:12,211 --> 01:55:13,044
then there was a director and then they 
were kind of aware that we were there 

2776
01:55:16,891 --> 01:55:17,724
watching,
so she was sort of putting on this sort 

2777
01:55:19,741 --> 01:55:23,550
of self conscious show,
like an in between takes.

2778
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:24,840
They would like,
they go,

2779
01:55:24,841 --> 01:55:25,411
okay,
cut.

2780
01:55:25,411 --> 01:55:26,244
And she was like,
keep eating her pussy and she would say 

2781
01:55:27,391 --> 01:55:29,010
something like,
I love my job,

2782
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:30,053
I love my job,
but it was like convincing herself that 

2783
01:55:32,971 --> 01:55:36,090
she loved her job and it's just like 
super bummed me out.

2784
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:37,313
Yeah.
I've been on a bunch of those sets and 

2785
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:38,973
you're right.
But there's different energy depending 

2786
01:55:40,381 --> 01:55:44,310
on the set like I've been on when I 
hosted the award show the end with Jenna

2787
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:45,160
Jamison,
so I got to one,

2788
01:55:45,161 --> 01:55:47,130
one of her sets and watch.
He actually was doing a lesbian scene.

2789
01:55:47,131 --> 01:55:48,300
Her husband at the time,
Jay,

2790
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,660
I guess was directing it and that was 
like a fucking set.

2791
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:53,850
There was a wardrobe,
there was craft,

2792
01:55:53,851 --> 01:55:55,160
you know what I mean?
Like that was a set.

2793
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:57,120
It was a high end sheet at the craft 
service.

2794
01:55:57,170 --> 01:55:57,731
We,
he,

2795
01:55:57,731 --> 01:56:02,520
yeah know I thought I just hot dogs and 
Tacos,

2796
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:06,960
I think I just watched her eat pussy.
I'm like,

2797
01:56:06,961 --> 01:56:07,794
this is Jenna Jamison.
She is the biggest ever in this 

2798
01:56:09,811 --> 01:56:11,580
business.
You have to watch this happen.

2799
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:12,863
And then we went on another one.
I saw another one another day where it 

2800
01:56:15,061 --> 01:56:20,061
was like a lower budget average budget 
where it was two guys and a girl and the

2801
01:56:20,131 --> 01:56:22,260
girl was in between the two guys and,
but the director was gone,

2802
01:56:22,261 --> 01:56:23,930
come on,
let me a little bit more,

2803
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:24,960
a little bit more of that.

2804
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:26,033
And they're,
they're,

2805
01:56:26,060 --> 01:56:26,893
they're amazing people that they can 
function sexually under those 

2806
01:56:28,771 --> 01:56:31,410
conditions.
Totally unsexy.

2807
01:56:32,070 --> 01:56:34,800
The sexiest one I saw was like a very 
low budget,

2808
01:56:34,801 --> 01:56:35,634
like a guy,
like one guy with a light and one guy 

2809
01:56:36,961 --> 01:56:41,670
holding a camera and a couple and they 
were like a couple who real amateur.

2810
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:44,600
And so it felt more like sex.
Um,

2811
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:47,220
and I don't think the guy could get hard
for a little while.

2812
01:56:47,221 --> 01:56:49,620
He struggled a bit,
but they were real people.

2813
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:53,040
That was the hottest one because it felt
the closest to real sex.

2814
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:54,520
Does that make sense?
That's like,

2815
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:56,550
yeah,
that's actual sex.

2816
01:56:56,630 --> 01:56:59,220
I don't like people like those sounds 
have too much.

2817
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:01,570
Ah Ha.
The faking it.

2818
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:05,250
Stop it.
I dated a couple girls in porn,

2819
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:08,100
like minor and one girl would blow me 
and I could never come from her.

2820
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:09,650
She could head,
but it was like,

2821
01:57:11,330 --> 01:57:12,330
that's not good.

2822
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:13,890
Hey,
settle down.

2823
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:14,873
Easy.
Just a little fucking pick it up and 

2824
01:57:15,721 --> 01:57:18,030
down the mountain.
They gag on purpose.

2825
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:20,730
Like,
hey,

2826
01:57:20,731 --> 01:57:21,271
hey,
hey.

2827
01:57:21,271 --> 01:57:21,950
Hey.
Hey.

2828
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:23,550
Hey.
That's nothing for me.

2829
01:57:23,551 --> 01:57:25,110
A little gag.
Who likes that?

2830
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:28,110
There are guys that liked that guy named
brandon irons.

2831
01:57:28,111 --> 01:57:28,944
I,
he's a Canadian guy with a giant Dick 

2832
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:32,670
and he would always.
He's a fucking night.

2833
01:57:32,671 --> 01:57:35,490
Who's was a big porn actor for a while.
I remember the fucking Joyce Rivera.

2834
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:36,353
You Know Joey?
Yeah,

2835
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:37,350
I know what that guy is.
Joe.

2836
01:57:37,351 --> 01:57:38,500
He's a good friend of mine.
And in,

2837
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:39,353
uh,
I met him at the award show in 2000 

2838
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:43,110
January of 2004,
but he's an older gentleman now,

2839
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:43,600
right?
Oh,

2840
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:45,480
he's been late fifties,
early sixties.

2841
01:57:45,481 --> 01:57:47,220
Maybe that was he still do porn.
Oh,

2842
01:57:47,221 --> 01:57:47,521
he's,
no,

2843
01:57:47,521 --> 01:57:49,830
he shoots it.
He shoots a lot of transport,

2844
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:51,120
like yeah,
joey is a fucking,

2845
01:57:51,121 --> 01:57:52,200
he's a naughty boy.

2846
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:55,020
He's a great director because he loves 
it.

2847
01:57:55,930 --> 01:57:58,410
He loves directing because he likes what
he's doing.

2848
01:57:58,680 --> 01:57:59,513
So my,
the first time I did the tonight show 

2849
01:58:00,570 --> 01:58:01,403
was in like September of 2004 I think.
And I watched it at Joey's house 

2850
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:08,790
downstairs and I've seen so much porn 
shot in that house.

2851
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:09,863
And,
and brandon irons was upstairs with his 

2852
01:58:10,861 --> 01:58:11,880
girlfriend.
Anyway.

2853
01:58:11,881 --> 01:58:13,260
Brandon irons,
his throat fucker.

2854
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:14,333
Like he's the guy look up brands and 
Ireland someday that guy will teach a 

2855
01:58:18,271 --> 01:58:19,710
Canadian dude,
I think he's in Canada now.

2856
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:23,850
He will fucking rip a throat apart and 
it's not my thing,

2857
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:26,040
but I think I asked him like,
don't you ever get your Dick Bitten?

2858
01:58:26,041 --> 01:58:29,010
Like it just seemed like such a hard way
to have sex and I don't like,

2859
01:58:29,011 --> 01:58:30,890
you're going to be uncomfortable.
Like you know what I mean,

2860
01:58:30,910 --> 01:58:31,743
like spanking or whatever.
But I don't like to feel like I'm 

2861
01:58:33,811 --> 01:58:34,644
missing somebody.

2862
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:38,910
That's just not my energy.
Also problem is like if you get hard,

2863
01:58:38,911 --> 01:58:39,744
if that's exciting on film,
like is that exciting to you in regular 

2864
01:58:43,001 --> 01:58:43,834
life or is this just like an act that 
you're putting on and film and like how 

2865
01:58:46,091 --> 01:58:46,924
do you like how sexually,
how does it translate or can you do 

2866
01:58:49,601 --> 01:58:50,350
both?
Right.

2867
01:58:50,350 --> 01:58:53,050
He might be a guy who just can get his 
dick hard anywhere.

2868
01:58:53,051 --> 01:58:56,140
Like Nacho vidal could literally fuck 
during a house fire.

2869
01:58:56,310 --> 01:58:59,670
It's just one of those guys that nothing
matters to him.

2870
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:01,430
You know,
Rocco Suffredini,

2871
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:04,540
these guys or,
or a Manuel Ferrara like these guys.

2872
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:05,703
The men impressed me more than the women
just because they have to keep their 

2873
01:59:07,271 --> 01:59:09,550
dick hard.
I don't know.

2874
01:59:09,551 --> 01:59:10,384
A lot of the newer guys,
I just don't really watch as much with 

2875
01:59:11,771 --> 01:59:12,604
big names,
but the fact that these guys can 

2876
01:59:13,811 --> 01:59:17,620
function under these conditions,
whereas my dick is very,

2877
01:59:17,621 --> 01:59:19,750
very susceptible to having an issue.

2878
01:59:19,930 --> 01:59:21,450
Well,
Preval Agora.

2879
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:23,200
There were real superstars,
right?

2880
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:24,063
There were real guys who were just 
freaks and now there's like chemically 

2881
01:59:26,291 --> 01:59:27,124
enhanced superstars,
but even with Viagara have lost heart 

2882
01:59:28,901 --> 01:59:30,910
on.
It's like I haven't taken salice in over

2883
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:31,740
a month I think,
and maybe it's been three,

2884
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:32,573
actually three or four months now.
I just stopped because my dick was 

2885
01:59:34,601 --> 01:59:35,710
horrible without it.
I'm like,

2886
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:36,544
I can't even with it,
it was like my dick was kind of half 

2887
01:59:38,381 --> 01:59:40,780
mast and I'm like,
you're training your body wrong.

2888
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:43,930
So I stopped taking you to talk to 
someone to give you that advice.

2889
01:59:44,190 --> 01:59:45,550
Um,
what to stop taking it,

2890
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:46,480
you know,
I just knew,

2891
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:47,373
I knew myself.
I was taking it the wrong time and I 

2892
01:59:48,881 --> 01:59:51,100
wasn't even horny and I'm like,
if you need one,

2893
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:52,360
take it,
but I haven't been sold.

2894
01:59:52,361 --> 01:59:54,010
So you were relying on its 
psychological?

2895
01:59:54,011 --> 01:59:55,150
Oh God,
yeah,

2896
01:59:55,151 --> 01:59:55,750
all the time.

2897
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:59,170
Like I thought there might be a chance 
that night I'd pop one alice,

2898
01:59:59,410 --> 02:00:00,243
go to the seller and hope for the best 
was too optimistic sitting there with a 

2899
02:00:05,021 --> 02:00:05,830
boner.
Yeah,

2900
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:07,450
I mean it just.
And it would make you feel great,

2901
02:00:07,451 --> 02:00:08,900
but I didn't need it.
So I,

2902
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:10,090
I kept taking him.
I didn't need.

2903
02:00:10,091 --> 02:00:10,924
It sounds like a,
what's a genius thing that nature has 

2904
02:00:13,181 --> 02:00:14,014
done to make it so that there's all 
these different factors that keep you 

2905
02:00:16,781 --> 02:00:18,010
from getting direct,
right.

2906
02:00:18,040 --> 02:00:19,750
Nervousness,
fear,

2907
02:00:19,751 --> 02:00:20,584
anxiety,
which makes sense because you really 

2908
02:00:23,051 --> 02:00:24,570
shouldn't be concentrating.
Like,

2909
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:25,423
because for,
for a human male sex is so 

2910
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:32,230
overwhelmingly interesting.
Right?

2911
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:33,303
That you,
if you could get it up in the face of 

2912
02:00:35,681 --> 02:00:36,514
danger,
it would probably be terrible for your 

2913
02:00:38,621 --> 02:00:40,090
survival mechanism.
Right?

2914
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:41,133
Right.
Do you read a book called the midnight 

2915
02:00:42,341 --> 02:00:43,620
of Garden in the middle of the,
uh,

2916
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:46,540
the good with the midnight in the garden
of evil.

2917
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:49,480
What was that?
The Kevin Spacey was in the film,

2918
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:52,540
good and evil in the bid night gardener.
So I'm fucking up.

2919
02:00:53,050 --> 02:00:55,660
I know what you're talking about.
Midnight in the garden of good and evil.

2920
02:00:55,690 --> 02:00:57,590
Yeah.
I never read that in the garden of Eden.

2921
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:59,930
I read the member of the movie.
I don't,

2922
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:01,390
I.
There was one thing in the book,

2923
02:01:01,391 --> 02:01:03,310
I remember years ago,
wow.

2924
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:07,660
Something happened and the guy's fucking
the girl and like somebody came,

2925
02:01:07,930 --> 02:01:08,763
they will fucking outdoors and there was
a bad guy who was coming with a gun or 

2926
02:01:11,201 --> 02:01:12,034
something and she said what she 
remembered is that like they couldn't 

2927
02:01:14,141 --> 02:01:15,370
move,
but she was like,

2928
02:01:15,371 --> 02:01:19,810
I remember he stayed hard while he was 
inside me and he kept his erection.

2929
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:21,520
I don't even know if it's fiction or 
nonfiction.

2930
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:24,100
Something tells me it was nonfiction,
but I could just be hoping.

2931
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:26,440
Um,
I've always envied guys like that,

2932
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:28,290
but I'm not like,
you know,

2933
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:30,420
I'm just,
it's a funny thing to envy.

2934
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:31,001
Well,
yeah,

2935
02:01:31,001 --> 02:01:31,970
people who are healthy.
I,

2936
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:34,450
I ended up health necessarily totally 
healthy.

2937
02:01:34,451 --> 02:01:35,970
Right?
Because you're really healthy.

2938
02:01:35,971 --> 02:01:37,390
It'd be thinking about your own 
survival.

2939
02:01:37,391 --> 02:01:39,160
Someone's got a gun to you.
That's true.

2940
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:39,810
Well,
no,

2941
02:01:39,810 --> 02:01:40,040
he was

2942
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,350
just in the area.
He wasn't right,

2943
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:42,373
but yeah,
but like the way you are or the way 

2944
02:01:43,281 --> 02:01:44,480
other guys are who are just like,
hey man,

2945
02:01:44,481 --> 02:01:46,940
I kinda liked this girl.
And we connected and it feels right.

2946
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:49,280
Like those guys I,
I envy.

2947
02:01:49,490 --> 02:01:53,300
Are you ever completely comfortable?
I'll give you ever like relaxed.

2948
02:01:53,301 --> 02:01:56,120
Where you look totally no peace.
Good question.

2949
02:01:56,121 --> 02:01:57,560
No,
and I've thought of that recently,

2950
02:01:57,561 --> 02:01:59,840
like I'm not comfortable around my own 
friends.

2951
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:04,850
Like I love my friends.
I'm comfortable around them but am other

2952
02:02:04,851 --> 02:02:05,684
times I'm really comfortable yet 
sometimes on the radio when we're going 

2953
02:02:08,511 --> 02:02:09,344
back and they'd,
when there's no time to think when 

2954
02:02:10,351 --> 02:02:11,184
there's like fucking six or seven comics
in there and you're just being animals 

2955
02:02:13,371 --> 02:02:14,204
and everybody's moving and punching and 
shitting on each other and we're very 

2956
02:02:16,701 --> 02:02:17,534
comfortable because there's no time to 
reflect or think you just kind of doing 

2957
02:02:21,291 --> 02:02:22,250
what you do comfortably.

2958
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:24,330
Um,
but in that environment I'm,

2959
02:02:24,331 --> 02:02:24,970
I'm,
I,

2960
02:02:24,970 --> 02:02:25,803
I realized that after like wow,
I felt like just really alive and great 

2961
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:34,280
in the moment,
in the moment is exactly at flowing in a

2962
02:02:34,281 --> 02:02:36,350
flow state doing something and not 
thinking.

2963
02:02:36,740 --> 02:02:38,900
But when I'm thinking I'm always 
worrying about this,

2964
02:02:38,901 --> 02:02:39,734
who the fucks me up and sexy,
but I know I'm not comfortable too 

2965
02:02:43,371 --> 02:02:45,300
often,
um,

2966
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:48,380
to do.
Have you ever tried to be?

2967
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:49,880
Yeah.
I don't know what to do.

2968
02:02:50,090 --> 02:02:50,923
Like I think it's all shame based.
So I'm trying to think if I talk about 

2969
02:02:53,031 --> 02:02:55,540
things that helps.
Um,

2970
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:56,413
but if it doesn't it look,
if it hasn't helped to the point where 

2971
02:02:57,801 --> 02:03:01,070
you're never comfortable now at 49,
it's like,

2972
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:01,963
boy,
this whatever this pattern is that you 

2973
02:03:03,201 --> 02:03:04,820
followed your whole life,
right.

2974
02:03:05,090 --> 02:03:07,270
Might not be the way to do it.
I mean,

2975
02:03:07,430 --> 02:03:08,480
I'm,
I'm just guessing.

2976
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:09,980
I think,
you know,

2977
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:11,270
but that's a good point.
I mean it's like,

2978
02:03:11,271 --> 02:03:14,120
I don't know why I'm never comfortable.
I'm not sure,

2979
02:03:14,240 --> 02:03:15,073
but I'm not,
but that's why I'm asking is asking you 

2980
02:03:16,311 --> 02:03:17,144
about yoga and that's what I wanted to 
ask you about meditation to just a 

2981
02:03:19,551 --> 02:03:20,384
wonder like maybe you can train your 
mind to relax when it comes to certain 

2982
02:03:24,021 --> 02:03:28,490
things or train your mind to not 
entertained so many neurotic thoughts or

2983
02:03:28,790 --> 02:03:29,623
train your mind to concentrate on 
positive things and eventually build 

2984
02:03:32,391 --> 02:03:34,220
that up the same way you build up 
endurance.

2985
02:03:34,221 --> 02:03:37,070
Like for like we were talking about 
those guys doing that exercise.

2986
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:37,913
We're circling a persons body like you 
burn yourself out unless you did it all 

2987
02:03:40,431 --> 02:03:41,264
the time.
Or like my friend Cam will runs a 

2988
02:03:42,291 --> 02:03:44,180
marathon a day.
He's used to it.

2989
02:03:44,181 --> 02:03:45,014
He does it all the time.
Like maybe you can do that also with 

2990
02:03:47,631 --> 02:03:48,410
your point of view.

2991
02:03:48,410 --> 02:03:51,020
Like maybe you can do that also with 
your mindfulness,

2992
02:03:51,021 --> 02:03:51,854
with just thinking about the world 
itself around you that you could maybe 

2993
02:03:54,621 --> 02:03:58,280
not entertain those same thoughts,
these neurotic thoughts.

2994
02:03:58,760 --> 02:03:59,593
Maybe those thoughts.
Maybe it's akin to like an endurance 

2995
02:04:02,180 --> 02:04:05,430
racer giving in to the idea of,
of uh,

2996
02:04:05,810 --> 02:04:08,030
discomfort and modern.
I just quit now.

2997
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:10,060
Like maybe there's the same sort of 
thing.

2998
02:04:10,061 --> 02:04:14,570
Maybe maybe these are mental patterns 
that you can sort of stray away from.

2999
02:04:14,571 --> 02:04:16,910
Keep your mind on a positive track.
I'm like,

3000
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:18,103
come up with some sort of like really 
good ways of thinking about things 

3001
02:04:21,141 --> 02:04:23,650
because you're obviously a very smart 
guy and you're in your,

3002
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:25,880
you're obviously a very sensitive guy.
You think a lot,

3003
02:04:26,330 --> 02:04:27,163
you know.
But if you let that thinking and that 

3004
02:04:28,671 --> 02:04:31,590
sensitivity sort of run a muck without 
any control,

3005
02:04:31,591 --> 02:04:34,040
without any discipline,
that seems to be the issue.

3006
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:35,053
And I've,
I've had those issues myself in the 

3007
02:04:36,021 --> 02:04:36,854
past,
which is one of the reasons why I bring 

3008
02:04:37,621 --> 02:04:39,150
it up.
I mean I'm not,

3009
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:40,313
I'm way healthier now at this point in 
my life than I've ever been before 

3010
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:44,753
because of really worked at it and 
worked at being at peace and being calm 

3011
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:49,614
and,
and then also I've worked at all the 

3012
02:04:51,930 --> 02:04:52,763
extraneous sort of influences that fuck 
with that and to sort of eliminate them 

3013
02:04:58,890 --> 02:05:03,330
and then do use exercise sort of as a 
drug in a lot of ways.

3014
02:05:03,331 --> 02:05:04,164
Like there's a.
One of the reasons why exercise so much 

3015
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:09,810
is because if I don't,
it's not like a looks thing.

3016
02:05:10,110 --> 02:05:13,470
It's a mind thing.
Like if I don't strain myself,

3017
02:05:13,471 --> 02:05:15,330
if I don't,
if I don't do something really difficult

3018
02:05:15,331 --> 02:05:16,164
all the time,
every day I do something five days a 

3019
02:05:18,631 --> 02:05:20,390
week,
I don't do it everyday.

3020
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:23,490
I have days where I take off,
but if I take more than one day off,

3021
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:25,290
my body starts going,
what are we doing?

3022
02:05:25,291 --> 02:05:27,420
What are we doing?
It's almost like you have a dog that you

3023
02:05:27,421 --> 02:05:29,380
don't walk your dog.
No,

3024
02:05:29,770 --> 02:05:30,603
I know that when you.
This is why one of the reasons why I 

3025
02:05:32,101 --> 02:05:32,934
thought about it way back in the day 
because my dog would be so much calmer 

3026
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:36,780
if I went and played with them for a few
hours,

3027
02:05:36,781 --> 02:05:40,050
so if I took her for a walk and threw 
the ball and he ran around,

3028
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:41,670
he be chill,
but if I did,

3029
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:42,570
he'd be like,
come on,

3030
02:05:42,571 --> 02:05:43,404
what's going on?
It's like,

3031
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:44,790
do I have a neurotic dog?
No,

3032
02:05:44,791 --> 02:05:46,290
I have a dog that doesn't get any 
exercise.

3033
02:05:46,291 --> 02:05:47,124
He has physical requirements for him to 
be content and I think people have 

3034
02:05:50,431 --> 02:05:52,680
physical requirements for them to be 
content too,

3035
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:53,753
but I think unlike people or unlike dogs
rather people can go on these sort of 

3036
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:02,550
downward mental spirals of,
of self hate,

3037
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:06,060
of self analysis,
of a neurosis,

3038
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:08,560
neurotic thinking of you.

3039
02:06:08,590 --> 02:06:12,930
You can get yourself in these really bad
patterns of like shitting on yourself or

3040
02:06:12,931 --> 02:06:15,180
looking at yourself in a negative way.
You know,

3041
02:06:15,181 --> 02:06:16,014
and I think you tend to gravitate 
towards these negative things sometimes 

3042
02:06:19,921 --> 02:06:22,560
and then you,
you realize it and then you bounce back.

3043
02:06:22,890 --> 02:06:25,230
But it's like,
what is causing you to gravitate towards

3044
02:06:25,231 --> 02:06:28,920
them and why can you never achieve it?
Just a few moments,

3045
02:06:28,921 --> 02:06:30,750
like an hour or two.
We just chill.

3046
02:06:30,751 --> 02:06:35,580
We could just sit at home and just read 
a book and have a cup of tea and just.

3047
02:06:35,610 --> 02:06:38,070
Do you ever feel like that?
Were you just comfortable and relax?

3048
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:43,100
Watch a movie on Netflix and chill out.
It's always restless if you tell it.

3049
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:44,153
The mental patterns and changing the 
physical stuff is what I gotta do first 

3050
02:06:47,071 --> 02:06:48,480
they bring the body and the mind will 
follow.

3051
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:51,090
So I have to stop doing certain things.

3052
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:52,043
And this thing of not cheating on this 
girl is it [inaudible] I've not cheated 

3053
02:06:56,101 --> 02:06:56,934
on girls before when they were here,
but she's not here yet and we're still 

3054
02:06:59,941 --> 02:07:00,774
in a relationship.
And for me to not it it's miraculous 

3055
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:06,360
that I'm not.
And we had a fight recently and I almost

3056
02:07:06,361 --> 02:07:08,250
did.
I started fucking tech and I'm like,

3057
02:07:08,251 --> 02:07:10,860
no,
you can't see what you do.

3058
02:07:11,240 --> 02:07:14,880
Sabotage things.
And that's why you're so um,

3059
02:07:14,890 --> 02:07:16,650
and I've been going kind of up and down 
lately.

3060
02:07:16,651 --> 02:07:18,620
But it's like whenever you're not doing 
something you,

3061
02:07:18,690 --> 02:07:20,820
it takes a while for you to adjust and 
go like,

3062
02:07:20,850 --> 02:07:21,683
all right,
when you feel something now you've got 

3063
02:07:22,971 --> 02:07:24,240
to feel it.
You can't feel it.

3064
02:07:24,510 --> 02:07:27,240
And then run and go on eroes.
Do you ever go to a therapist?

3065
02:07:27,270 --> 02:07:28,560
Oh yeah.
Many,

3066
02:07:28,561 --> 02:07:30,420
many others.
One I went to,

3067
02:07:30,421 --> 02:07:32,520
she was very nice,
but once I started getting familiar with

3068
02:07:32,521 --> 02:07:33,660
them,
you know,

3069
02:07:33,661 --> 02:07:36,070
there was one time I forget why I was 
really fucking

3070
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:39,220
suicidal and I called her.
I don't like calling a therapist.

3071
02:07:39,221 --> 02:07:42,100
It was a bad day.
And I was talking to her.

3072
02:07:42,110 --> 02:07:43,870
What triggered it?
No,

3073
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:46,400
it's usually the same stuff around 
feeling like a failure.

3074
02:07:46,401 --> 02:07:49,390
It just the same shit that everybody has
the same feeling like I'm worthless.

3075
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:51,570
So I talked to her and um,
uh,

3076
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:52,503
she was being nice but she was not being
helpful and I didn't want her to rescue 

3077
02:07:55,781 --> 02:07:56,614
me,
but I wonder just simply to give some 

3078
02:07:57,671 --> 02:08:00,910
kind of an answer or trigger me to ask 
myself a question.

3079
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:03,040
As a therapist,
do they trigger you to go,

3080
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:04,900
why am I doing?
It's my fucking.

3081
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:06,840
That's what their job is.
Nonsense.

3082
02:08:07,050 --> 02:08:09,010
She was,
she just not very good at it.

3083
02:08:09,150 --> 02:08:10,290
No.
She was like,

3084
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:11,410
yeah,
no,

3085
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:13,540
I know.
I know.

3086
02:08:14,380 --> 02:08:16,210
Let's just kind of empathizing a little,
but I'm like,

3087
02:08:16,211 --> 02:08:17,800
I don't need you to fucking empathize 
with me.

3088
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:22,570
I just need you to just give me a 
suggestion on something.

3089
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:25,840
Don't just be okay.
This is where we're at.

3090
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:27,280
All right now.
I'll see you next week.

3091
02:08:27,310 --> 02:08:29,140
You really might not.
You know what I mean?

3092
02:08:29,141 --> 02:08:30,110
I didn't say that to her because I'm 
not,

3093
02:08:30,111 --> 02:08:30,731
I don't like to,
you know,

3094
02:08:30,731 --> 02:08:32,590
I'm not a fucking emo girl,
but I just was like,

3095
02:08:32,591 --> 02:08:33,424
all right,
whatever.

3096
02:08:33,670 --> 02:08:34,503
Um,
but I feel like I can't be in a 

3097
02:08:35,411 --> 02:08:37,840
therapist therapy with her anymore.
Well,

3098
02:08:37,870 --> 02:08:39,760
I think therapists are probably a lot 
like comics,

3099
02:08:39,761 --> 02:08:40,594
right?
There's really good ones and there's 

3100
02:08:41,011 --> 02:08:41,844
really bad ones.
Ones that some people think are really 

3101
02:08:43,631 --> 02:08:45,760
good and you might think suck.
You know what I mean?

3102
02:08:45,761 --> 02:08:47,340
There's just,
I haven't gotten yours.

3103
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:49,000
I mean a few years,
but uh,

3104
02:08:49,001 --> 02:08:50,920
I feel better now than I have in a long,
long time.

3105
02:08:50,921 --> 02:08:52,170
Like I'm happy now.
I'm just,

3106
02:08:52,330 --> 02:08:55,450
I'm fucked up lately because I'm kind of
going through this huge change,

3107
02:08:56,110 --> 02:08:58,750
but other than that I feel better than I
have in a long time.

3108
02:08:58,870 --> 02:09:00,430
Like life is good.
That's good.

3109
02:09:00,460 --> 02:09:02,920
I love the radio show I'm doing.
I have fun with Sam.

3110
02:09:02,930 --> 02:09:04,030
Everybody really do like,
you know,

3111
02:09:04,150 --> 02:09:07,120
I enjoy working with Sam.
He's a fucking goof ball and I have fun.

3112
02:09:08,110 --> 02:09:10,010
I love doing the thing with Matt.
Like I just,

3113
02:09:10,011 --> 02:09:13,990
I have fun doing that stupid fucking 
chip is the biggest thing in my life and

3114
02:09:13,991 --> 02:09:15,530
I love doing it.
But character,

3115
02:09:16,130 --> 02:09:18,040
why is that?
The people love it.

3116
02:09:18,190 --> 02:09:19,023
Like the podcast they're going to hate 
this week because we did it in La and 

3117
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:25,060
the women didn't know chip was and it 
was very ugly experience last week.

3118
02:09:25,650 --> 02:09:26,970
They would just from that.
This uh,

3119
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,390
Maria Menounos,
his boyfriend,

3120
02:09:28,391 --> 02:09:30,460
Kevin Undergaro,
he runs this place.

3121
02:09:30,461 --> 02:09:32,890
They do all these after show.
He's a huge chip fan.

3122
02:09:33,250 --> 02:09:33,701
So he's like,
Hey,

3123
02:09:33,701 --> 02:09:34,534
while you're out here you can use my 
studio because I have a podcast because 

3124
02:09:36,761 --> 02:09:39,400
that's.
I can't teach.

3125
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:41,880
It's a different hair every week.
I can't look.

3126
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:44,470
I can't look at it.
It's fucking humiliating.

3127
02:09:44,950 --> 02:09:47,390
I love the face.
You make me do it.

3128
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:49,240
A different wig on every week.
Every week.

3129
02:09:49,241 --> 02:09:50,050
Yeah.
The glasses,

3130
02:09:50,050 --> 02:09:52,430
those are glasses that Colin Quinn gave 
me to fuck.

3131
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:55,390
But it's,
it's so awful.

3132
02:09:56,620 --> 02:09:57,453
But the last one we released as a live 
one and it's the people we was an hour 

3133
02:09:59,981 --> 02:10:00,814
and 20 minutes long.
We did it the village underground and 

3134
02:10:03,041 --> 02:10:05,500
it's sold out faster than anything I've 
sold in years.

3135
02:10:09,140 --> 02:10:12,670
It's fucking ridiculous character.
You know what it is.

3136
02:10:12,671 --> 02:10:14,530
And,
and it was a fun shy at Collin,

3137
02:10:14,531 --> 02:10:17,490
Anthony fucking Sam was on,
um,

3138
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,513
uh,
who have lost their fucking Bobby Kelly 

3139
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:22,750
and it was just so silly.
And the people I think is,

3140
02:10:22,751 --> 02:10:26,170
it's almost like everybody's greatest 
fear is to be that on aware.

3141
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:28,390
Like that's a weird,
like why do people like this?

3142
02:10:28,391 --> 02:10:32,410
Because the joke stink if fucking 
terrible jokes.

3143
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:36,350
And they said with conviction,
but she always has people around him who

3144
02:10:36,351 --> 02:10:40,730
know him doing it this week in La was me
and Sam and x park was on,

3145
02:10:40,731 --> 02:10:41,564
who was a fun guy.
But he knows me as the wrestler who 

3146
02:10:43,851 --> 02:10:46,300
fucked China in the porn.
He was extra.

3147
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:48,200
There's a great guy.
He,

3148
02:10:48,201 --> 02:10:49,990
uh,
means more than a guy who fuck China,

3149
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,090
but that's using the reference people 
have.

3150
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:53,240
Well no,
but he knows Jim,

3151
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:53,871
so he's like,
hey,

3152
02:10:53,871 --> 02:10:56,000
check is trying to go with it,
but he doesn't know what to do.

3153
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:57,313
And these fucking four girls that have 
no idea because Kevin wanted it to be a 

3154
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:04,330
train wreck.
Fucking fucking Kevin Underdog.

3155
02:11:04,610 --> 02:11:07,310
He wanted to be a train wreck.
So he had these girls.

3156
02:11:07,311 --> 02:11:08,380
He didn't tell him a little while,
go here,

3157
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:10,520
Jim Warren's going to be there to huge 
podcast from New York.

3158
02:11:11,030 --> 02:11:11,863
So I fucking do it.
And they're trying to go with it and 

3159
02:11:13,311 --> 02:11:16,610
chip just an abrasive.
They didn't know what to do.

3160
02:11:16,611 --> 02:11:21,200
I was the only time I've ever been 
humiliated doing chip.

3161
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:25,340
I was embarrassed and uncomfortable.
And I also like,

3162
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:26,383
this is what it's supposed to be.
This guy stinks when you supposed to be 

3163
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:33,900
disliked because people were in on the 
joke,

3164
02:11:33,901 --> 02:11:35,030
loved the joke,
you know?

3165
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:37,430
And,
and they get that the jokes are awful.

3166
02:11:37,431 --> 02:11:39,740
So the fun point with people who love it
is to,

3167
02:11:39,741 --> 02:11:40,574
at times give one,
like my ex girlfriend really new chip 

3168
02:11:43,070 --> 02:11:44,840
and there was times I would do a is so 
bad.

3169
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:45,790
And she was like,
oh,

3170
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:50,470
that's fucking terrible.
Like she loved.

3171
02:11:51,170 --> 02:11:54,050
Don't you think that the people that 
love chipotle actually love this episode

3172
02:11:54,051 --> 02:11:57,080
then because it's chip interacting with 
people who have no idea who he is.

3173
02:11:57,140 --> 02:11:57,973
If they really love chip,
if they understand who chip jepperson 

3174
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:02,690
really is,
they're going to go fucking bananas.

3175
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:04,580
I can't even watch it.
Dude.

3176
02:12:04,581 --> 02:12:08,820
I can't watch it.
I was embarrassed because Sam,

3177
02:12:09,110 --> 02:12:10,120
you with me.
I'm like,

3178
02:12:10,121 --> 02:12:10,954
dude,
is it that?

3179
02:12:11,060 --> 02:12:12,890
And he goes,
it was really uncomfortable.

3180
02:12:14,740 --> 02:12:15,573
I'm now I'm compelled people to get it.
There are people who really who didn't 

3181
02:12:19,740 --> 02:12:20,630
videotape it to,
oh,

3182
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:24,320
we videotape every one ion video and 
it's on Youtube for free.

3183
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:26,360
Like,
I waited on itunes as well,

3184
02:12:26,370 --> 02:12:27,203
all for free.
I make a little money from the Ed and I 

3185
02:12:28,521 --> 02:12:29,810
said,
I want to charge with the video.

3186
02:12:29,811 --> 02:12:32,480
I want to do something with it someday.
I don't know where it will go.

3187
02:12:32,481 --> 02:12:35,030
We've only been doing it a few months.
Um,

3188
02:12:35,110 --> 02:12:35,943
you know,
I think that this is like,

3189
02:12:35,970 --> 02:12:37,940
I've 25 episodes.
We do one a week.

3190
02:12:37,970 --> 02:12:40,170
He does live reads.
Yeah.

3191
02:12:40,630 --> 02:12:45,630
Give me some volume.
Fucking slammed Ya Dad fucking head.

3192
02:12:47,921 --> 02:12:50,910
I'm call.
Watched it go.

3193
02:12:54,060 --> 02:12:59,060
Was that fun?
Love.

3194
02:13:01,010 --> 02:13:03,590
You look like a Honolulu.
Hipster.

3195
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:06,140
Yeah.
What's that say?

3196
02:13:06,141 --> 02:13:07,790
Fucking Honolulu.
Hipster.

3197
02:13:08,030 --> 02:13:09,620
Fucking upstate New York.
You have pizza,

3198
02:13:09,621 --> 02:13:12,370
garbage,
Honolulu in Hawaii,

3199
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:13,580
you know,
stupid

3200
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:17,393
nonsense.

3201
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:20,540
Now,
when did you,

3202
02:13:20,630 --> 02:13:22,220
you came up with this character when you
were on.

3203
02:13:22,221 --> 02:13:23,054
Oh,
and a what?

3204
02:13:23,090 --> 02:13:26,030
What made you do this?
Like girlfriends hated it.

3205
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:28,670
I think we talked with his girlfriend 
drove me.

3206
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:31,560
They hated it so much because it was 
humiliating and I,

3207
02:13:31,561 --> 02:13:33,930
it got a reaction out of them and I just
kept doing it so much.

3208
02:13:34,230 --> 02:13:37,170
It was so much fun.
And a lot of times I,

3209
02:13:37,171 --> 02:13:38,850
anthony,
like at first hated it,

3210
02:13:38,851 --> 02:13:41,880
but then anthony started to love it.
But then opie never loved it.

3211
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:43,073
It was always kind of fun to do because 
I knew like deep down uncle Paulie 

3212
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:46,013
hates.
So I would always do uncle Paul just to 

3213
02:13:47,371 --> 02:13:50,850
fucking make him sick because he 
couldn't get with uncle Paul.

3214
02:13:50,851 --> 02:13:51,571
Anthony,
of course.

3215
02:13:51,571 --> 02:13:54,120
Could you more comfortable now doing it 
without him?

3216
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:56,820
The radio show?
Much much Yo.

3217
02:13:56,850 --> 02:13:58,590
Yeah.
We stopped liking each other.

3218
02:13:58,590 --> 02:13:59,880
I mean,
the reality is we are,

3219
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:00,753
you know,
I really mean I don't wish the guy bad 

3220
02:14:02,401 --> 02:14:03,234
in his real life,
like I don't want bad shit to happen to 

3221
02:14:04,801 --> 02:14:05,710
them.
But uh,

3222
02:14:05,730 --> 02:14:07,860
we simply stopped liking each other.
So,

3223
02:14:07,861 --> 02:14:09,050
um,
but he,

3224
02:14:09,051 --> 02:14:11,880
he was enjoying his afternoon show much 
more without me.

3225
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:13,830
Then he was with me.
Um,

3226
02:14:13,831 --> 02:14:15,510
I got the morning spa,
spa or whatever,

3227
02:14:15,511 --> 02:14:16,790
you know,
um,

3228
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:19,890
I think the company just was annoyed at 
him or whatever they like to be in San.

3229
02:14:19,891 --> 02:14:22,620
We're hungry.
But his afternoon show was good.

3230
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:23,611
I mean,
uh,

3231
02:14:23,611 --> 02:14:23,991
you know,
he,

3232
02:14:23,991 --> 02:14:26,070
him and shirod and those guys,
they were having fun.

3233
02:14:26,190 --> 02:14:27,660
So people didn't like it,
they didn't like it,

3234
02:14:27,661 --> 02:14:31,020
but he sounded like he was having fun 
and he was looking at him fired.

3235
02:14:31,021 --> 02:14:32,010
Like what,
what happened,

3236
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:34,860
what the technical reason was,
was um,

3237
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:37,380
he had filmed role in campus.

3238
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:40,670
Our booker taking a shit.
Um,

3239
02:14:40,770 --> 02:14:41,550
now I know,
Oop,

3240
02:14:41,550 --> 02:14:44,690
well he filmed me doing it in 2009,
but he was being a goofball.

3241
02:14:44,790 --> 02:14:48,690
I don't think he was trying to be 
degrading just being an ass and then I'm

3242
02:14:48,990 --> 02:14:53,250
showing it to I think a couple of the 
comics and I guess I don't know exactly.

3243
02:14:54,090 --> 02:14:56,370
I heard about it after the ball had 
already been rolling,

3244
02:14:56,850 --> 02:14:57,683
so somehow role and got nervous that he 
was going to release it and maybe with 

3245
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:02,540
tea,
I don't know what role he said to them,

3246
02:15:02,541 --> 02:15:03,374
I really don't,
but I think that it got back to one of 

3247
02:15:05,131 --> 02:15:09,060
Roland's bosses and then the head of the
talent department spoke to them and then

3248
02:15:09,061 --> 02:15:12,780
once human resources got involved then 
things change.

3249
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:14,153
And I remember there was a clip of it 
was getting bad and there was another 

3250
02:15:18,751 --> 02:15:19,584
producer in the studio named Paul and he
was videotaping it and I think he had 

3251
02:15:23,521 --> 02:15:27,510
been unrolling side and he thought he 
was being a dick to him.

3252
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:28,650
He's going to be a dick to me.
Nobody's like,

3253
02:15:28,651 --> 02:15:29,484
yeah,
because you chose rolling in this whole 

3254
02:15:30,271 --> 02:15:32,520
thing,
like making it a public thing.

3255
02:15:32,521 --> 02:15:34,950
That was really uncomfortable.
And then Paul goes,

3256
02:15:34,951 --> 02:15:36,120
yeah,
well I thought it was wrong.

3257
02:15:36,121 --> 02:15:37,100
And then she,
rod goes like,

3258
02:15:37,110 --> 02:15:38,070
ah,
he was having fun.

3259
02:15:38,071 --> 02:15:39,690
We all saw the tape,
he was enjoying it,

3260
02:15:39,691 --> 02:15:42,720
he was laughing and when I heard that,
I'm like,

3261
02:15:42,750 --> 02:15:45,600
oh no,
he just said we all saw the tape.

3262
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:48,780
So other like that just made it.
And again,

3263
02:15:48,810 --> 02:15:50,040
maybe they were going to fire them 
anyway,

3264
02:15:50,070 --> 02:15:52,200
I don't know,
like they don't tell me that shit.

3265
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:53,053
Um,
but he thinks that the company was out 

3266
02:15:55,081 --> 02:15:55,914
to get him.

3267
02:15:57,570 --> 02:15:58,470
I don't know.
And again,

3268
02:15:58,471 --> 02:15:59,880
I kind of know what they said to him 
privately,

3269
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:01,403
but to me he had two months left on his 
deal and no company wants to fire you 

3270
02:16:05,761 --> 02:16:09,650
two months out because.
Because the potential lawsuits loss,

3271
02:16:09,810 --> 02:16:12,760
they would much rather let you ride it 
out and then just not resign.

3272
02:16:12,761 --> 02:16:16,080
You will serious isn't a weird place 
because of podcasts.

3273
02:16:16,140 --> 02:16:18,240
Yes.
I mean it's just a very weird place that

3274
02:16:18,241 --> 02:16:19,074
the idea of paying money for these talk 
shows that are going to get interrupted 

3275
02:16:22,261 --> 02:16:26,370
by commercials and to have to listen to 
them only when they come on and not have

3276
02:16:26,371 --> 02:16:28,950
them on demand.
It's such an inferior distribution where

3277
02:16:28,951 --> 02:16:30,130
they demand like now

3278
02:16:30,230 --> 02:16:32,920
now they're on demand is getting your 
phone an hour after it's up.

3279
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:33,793
You can get it an hour after it's but 
live you can listen live on the phone 

3280
02:16:37,691 --> 02:16:40,060
and get it to.
What I'm saying is on your radio,

3281
02:16:40,061 --> 02:16:42,300
like if you're in your car and you,
you,

3282
02:16:42,390 --> 02:16:43,223
you can't just pick.
I want to listen to Tuesdays opie and 

3283
02:16:46,081 --> 02:16:49,840
Anthony Show or Jim Norton and Sam show.
I can't just pick that.

3284
02:16:50,050 --> 02:16:52,090
I don't know if you can,
unless you have a phone,

3285
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:54,430
it might be a way to do it.
That phone hooked up.

3286
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:55,181
Yeah,
I think so.

3287
02:16:55,181 --> 02:16:55,660
Yeah.
Right.

3288
02:16:55,660 --> 02:16:59,470
But I don't think you could do that.
Like Sirius radio is only playing what's

3289
02:16:59,471 --> 02:17:04,471
playing right now?
I think so far I don't know her.

3290
02:17:04,990 --> 02:17:09,760
I mean I don't have a thing where I 
could just pick an episode.

3291
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:12,730
How is the podcast played in a car?
You could just get.

3292
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:14,680
There's a bunch of different ways.
One,

3293
02:17:14,681 --> 02:17:18,100
you can do it where you could stream it 
live through youtube.

3294
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:21,680
Some people do that and you just play 
the audio and if you have it setup,

3295
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:24,700
you can play the video.
Some people do it where you,

3296
02:17:24,701 --> 02:17:25,900
uh,
you're on stitcher,

3297
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:29,520
stitcher is a low bit rate version,
meaning it's a,

3298
02:17:29,530 --> 02:17:31,930
the audio quality's not as good because 
it's compressed,

3299
02:17:32,260 --> 02:17:35,830
but it's way quicker to download.
So if you have some sort of a plan where

3300
02:17:35,831 --> 02:17:36,664
you want to get a less data per month,
a lot of people use stitcher or they 

3301
02:17:41,141 --> 02:17:44,260
just get it off of itunes.
But the thing about it is that you just,

3302
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:46,930
if you have your phone bluetooth up,
you literally,

3303
02:17:46,931 --> 02:17:47,764
all you have to do is press play and 
it'll immediately play like whatever 

3304
02:17:50,291 --> 02:17:53,950
episode like you to scroll through,
scroll through our stuff.

3305
02:17:54,450 --> 02:17:57,520
If you go to Syria now too,
on the new operating system,

3306
02:17:58,030 --> 02:17:59,290
just like ask for it.
Yeah,

3307
02:17:59,291 --> 02:18:02,650
you could play it for Siri.
But if you go through,

3308
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:04,150
have you ever done,
do you use it?

3309
02:18:04,330 --> 02:18:09,330
Do you use a itunes or a podcast APP?
I never look at podcast standing by like

3310
02:18:10,870 --> 02:18:13,980
my most recent ones.
Of all the ones that I subscribe to that

3311
02:18:13,981 --> 02:18:16,240
I can just take one,
click it and boom,

3312
02:18:16,300 --> 02:18:17,180
now it's playing.
Yeah,

3313
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:21,190
I mean that's just,
it's done differently on serious.

3314
02:18:21,191 --> 02:18:22,480
Yeah.
The APP you have to use.

3315
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:24,290
The on demand is pretty good,
but it's,

3316
02:18:24,310 --> 02:18:26,740
I think it's an hour after it as you can
get it forever.

3317
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:28,120
I believe.
I don't list.

3318
02:18:28,121 --> 02:18:30,700
I don't really listen to the show.
I mean I never listened to our show.

3319
02:18:30,950 --> 02:18:33,250
Um,
I listened to it on drives and like wow,

3320
02:18:33,251 --> 02:18:34,084
I kinda like it.

3321
02:18:34,270 --> 02:18:34,720
Um,
it's,

3322
02:18:34,720 --> 02:18:35,553
it's new.
We finally got anthony back in the 

3323
02:18:36,731 --> 02:18:39,890
building.
I'm allowed to come on as a guest in the

3324
02:18:39,900 --> 02:18:40,733
building.
I fought for three years for that and 

3325
02:18:41,621 --> 02:18:44,560
literally right after he got fired,
they let him anthony back in after.

3326
02:18:44,561 --> 02:18:46,240
I hope you got fired.
And I'm not saying that he kept them.

3327
02:18:46,280 --> 02:18:47,620
I don't know.
It could be really honest.

3328
02:18:47,621 --> 02:18:48,820
I don't know.
Um,

3329
02:18:48,821 --> 02:18:50,350
I don't think that he actively kept him 
out.

3330
02:18:50,351 --> 02:18:52,270
No.
Do they know the real numbers?

3331
02:18:52,271 --> 02:18:54,580
Like did they ever tell you how many 
people were actually listening?

3332
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:56,440
Never.
I don't know if they know.

3333
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:58,240
I mean,
I don't know how they would track that.

3334
02:18:58,270 --> 02:19:00,790
They may,
but they don't apply to me.

3335
02:19:00,791 --> 02:19:01,624
It's like I really want to know will 
give us the negotiating power on a part 

3336
02:19:03,981 --> 02:19:05,080
of me is like,
I really don't want to know,

3337
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:07,480
but the fact that we're getting raises,
I think we're doing okay.

3338
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:09,180
Like I,
that's the only way I can tell you right

3339
02:19:09,310 --> 02:19:10,670
is that they,
I know that they want to,

3340
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:12,910
to keep me every time the contract said 
okay,

3341
02:19:12,911 --> 02:19:14,830
we must be doing okay.
Um,

3342
02:19:14,860 --> 02:19:16,250
but no,
I don't know what the numbers are,

3343
02:19:16,270 --> 02:19:17,103
just,
it's amazing how quickly it became a 

3344
02:19:18,551 --> 02:19:20,070
different thing,
you know,

3345
02:19:20,071 --> 02:19:20,904
like,
like I remember when Howard went to 

3346
02:19:21,911 --> 02:19:22,750
serious,
it was like,

3347
02:19:22,810 --> 02:19:23,643
wow,
how Lulea finally we're going to get 

3348
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:28,070
uncensored radio.
And then

3349
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:28,903
it became,
well it's still just radio and still 

3350
02:19:31,131 --> 02:19:31,964
live in,
now you have to pay for it and now it's 

3351
02:19:33,501 --> 02:19:36,710
10 bucks a month.
And mean he made out like a bandit.

3352
02:19:36,711 --> 02:19:39,350
I mean he made ridiculous sums of money 
from it,

3353
02:19:39,590 --> 02:19:42,790
but where's the future in that?
It just seems like that's a,

3354
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:45,440
it's,
it's like almost like investing in.

3355
02:19:45,860 --> 02:19:46,693
I mean if you're,
if you're someone who's got a piece of 

3356
02:19:48,261 --> 02:19:49,790
that,
it's like where's that going?

3357
02:19:49,791 --> 02:19:52,580
Like how are you going to keep.
You can't even use it in a tunnel.

3358
02:19:52,910 --> 02:19:53,743
You know,
the thing with serious and this is this 

3359
02:19:54,740 --> 02:19:57,370
really the scary for job security,
but they have really.

3360
02:19:57,400 --> 02:20:00,290
Scott is good at getting big name 
talent,

3361
02:20:00,590 --> 02:20:02,240
like a Beatles channel on all this 
stuff.

3362
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:04,250
They're good at getting good name,
good name,

3363
02:20:04,310 --> 02:20:05,143
a big name.
People doing shows Ferguson's on their 

3364
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:08,730
channel.
Yeah.

3365
02:20:08,730 --> 02:20:11,750
I'm not a faction where it goes.
We're all in faction now.

3366
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:12,830
Faction talk.
Yeah.

3367
02:20:12,831 --> 02:20:14,540
I hate the name [inaudible].
It doesn't say comedy,

3368
02:20:14,541 --> 02:20:15,650
but whatever it is,
what it is.

3369
02:20:16,040 --> 02:20:16,873
It's us and then Camino and and then 
Ellis and then Craig and then Nick 

3370
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:22,860
Depalo was a very funny show.
Who's the lawyer?

3371
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:26,090
Nick is a fucking savagely funny guy.
Love that guy.

3372
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:30,260
He's just a fucking raw fucking bark out
a joke.

3373
02:20:30,290 --> 02:20:32,780
Funny Guy like mick is.
Here's the thing about nick.

3374
02:20:32,930 --> 02:20:33,763
He's never afraid to try to be funny.
Like I've done a lot of projects with 

3375
02:20:36,471 --> 02:20:37,730
them.
We get tough crowd for two years.

3376
02:20:37,731 --> 02:20:39,320
I've just done a shitload of stuff back,
back,

3377
02:20:39,321 --> 02:20:40,154
back,
back like Nicholas fucking fire lines 

3378
02:20:41,601 --> 02:20:44,960
out and I've always admired him for that
because sometimes they work,

3379
02:20:44,961 --> 02:20:45,794
sometimes they don't,
but he's unafraid is a funny fucking 

3380
02:20:47,841 --> 02:20:51,350
dude and he's unafraid to bark stuff out
and be who he is.

3381
02:20:51,350 --> 02:20:53,630
Like I love that.
And he does a great show.

3382
02:20:54,050 --> 02:20:55,520
He's a really surprisingly good radio 
guy.

3383
02:20:55,521 --> 02:20:57,110
Like,
but go into breaks and all that stuff.

3384
02:20:57,620 --> 02:20:59,690
But yeah,
Athens doing it for a long time with rd.

3385
02:20:59,691 --> 02:21:00,710
Remember?
That's right,

3386
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:02,210
yes,
I was on the show,

3387
02:21:02,211 --> 02:21:03,044
but I remember watching the one blow out
that they had where nick was trying to 

3388
02:21:06,141 --> 02:21:10,010
do some read that they had already.
Didn't just want it to kind of fuck off.

3389
02:21:11,290 --> 02:21:13,970
You can't let it get to you like that.
We've had the blow outs.

3390
02:21:13,971 --> 02:21:15,140
I've been thRough them,
I've seen them.

3391
02:21:15,170 --> 02:21:18,770
Me and it never had one I love and one 
of my fucking.

3392
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:20,240
I just wrote the foreword to his book.
I don't know,

3393
02:21:20,250 --> 02:21:21,770
I'm supposed to say that,
but too bad.

3394
02:21:21,771 --> 02:21:23,210
I'm proud of it.
I fucking love him.

3395
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:24,960
And he's doing a show with already now.
Right.

3396
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:29,600
The a show,
the fucking greatest name.

3397
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:32,230
They had a great billboard for it and 
uh,

3398
02:21:32,250 --> 02:21:35,270
it's really funny man.
It's to listen to that.

3399
02:21:35,310 --> 02:21:36,590
Do it for the,
to the compound yet.

3400
02:21:36,591 --> 02:21:38,240
How much does that cost?
I honesTly don't know.

3401
02:21:38,420 --> 02:21:40,310
I do pay for it though.
He offered me a free one,

3402
02:21:40,311 --> 02:21:40,790
but I'm like,
oh,

3403
02:21:40,790 --> 02:21:42,140
I'll chime in.
I mean I'll fucking,

3404
02:21:42,410 --> 02:21:45,290
I'll chip in and it's doing well.
Framed that whole compound meal.

3405
02:21:45,291 --> 02:21:46,011
Yeah.
Yeah.

3406
02:21:46,011 --> 02:21:48,080
He hasn't skipped a beat.
His life is fucking doing great.

3407
02:21:48,081 --> 02:21:48,914
Yeah.
there's not a great thing to our their 

3408
02:21:49,900 --> 02:21:51,200
mugshot.
They're real legit.

3409
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:53,960
Mugshots hilarious.
They did it.

3410
02:21:53,970 --> 02:21:56,030
Yeah.
Compound media.

3411
02:21:56,330 --> 02:21:58,490
I like how he called it compound media 
too because.

3412
02:21:58,520 --> 02:21:59,840
Oh,
look at the aaa show.

3413
02:21:59,940 --> 02:22:01,250
A great poster.
September fifth.

3414
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:02,780
Now.
Can you get that on your phone?

3415
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:06,530
You can get it on an app.
I have the anthony put it in the car.

3416
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:07,730
You can listen to it in the car.

3417
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:09,410
He's a but yeah,
he's.

3418
02:22:09,470 --> 02:22:11,270
I love him too.
He's one of my favorite people ever.

3419
02:22:11,271 --> 02:22:14,780
He's literally somebody who I don't 
think I'll ever not be close to.

3420
02:22:14,900 --> 02:22:17,570
There's no one create like I love sam.
I love all these guys I've worked with,

3421
02:22:17,571 --> 02:22:19,010
but anthony,
that was a weird.

3422
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:22,580
It's a comic thing that happens when 
you're going back and forth,

3423
02:22:22,581 --> 02:22:25,600
but some of this in energy you're 
exchanging and with do it.

3424
02:22:25,740 --> 02:22:28,530
There are jim norton laugh compilations.
I never lived on my own shit.

3425
02:22:28,531 --> 02:22:30,360
I don't listen to the old show.
I can't listen to it,

3426
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:31,673
but those I can listen to because 
they're all anthony just making me 

3427
02:22:34,111 --> 02:22:35,550
laugh.
It's not me saying funny shit,

3428
02:22:35,551 --> 02:22:39,870
it's anthony saying funny shit that 
every time fucking gets me.

3429
02:22:39,871 --> 02:22:40,704
Like he would literally make me laugh 
like that wheeze laugh than an audience 

3430
02:22:42,871 --> 02:22:44,310
member gets.
I'm like,

3431
02:22:44,311 --> 02:22:46,930
I never get to fucking feel that way,
but he's not even.

3432
02:22:47,010 --> 02:22:48,530
What's the craziest.
he's not a standup.

3433
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:50,700
He's not a standup.
He's done it a little bit,

3434
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:52,440
but in that rotating.
Yeah,

3435
02:22:52,441 --> 02:22:53,274
he tried it.
A couple of [inaudible] in montreal a 

3436
02:22:54,841 --> 02:22:56,810
couple of years ago just to do it.
Yeah,

3437
02:22:56,910 --> 02:22:58,700
after he had been fired.
oh my god.

3438
02:22:58,740 --> 02:22:58,901
no,
no,

3439
02:22:58,901 --> 02:22:59,734
no.
This is what opie and anthony were 

3440
02:23:00,031 --> 02:23:03,060
supposed to do,
a show together to host a comedy show in

3441
02:23:03,061 --> 02:23:04,650
montreal.
I was part of the show,

3442
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:07,210
but I'll be at home for some reason.
He flew home a day early,

3443
02:23:07,211 --> 02:23:08,044
didn't want to do it,
so I did it by himself and hosted the 

3444
02:23:09,601 --> 02:23:12,450
show and started shitting on the 
comedians and he was really funny.

3445
02:23:12,860 --> 02:23:14,880
First time ever on stage.
he was fucking funny.

3446
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:16,160
Wow.
But in a,

3447
02:23:16,370 --> 02:23:18,450
in a comic room.
Patrice said that about him.

3448
02:23:18,510 --> 02:23:19,343
He said,
he said anthony can access funny faster 

3449
02:23:21,991 --> 02:23:22,860
than any person.

3450
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:25,290
I've ever seen and patrice didn't hand 
out.

3451
02:23:25,320 --> 02:23:26,153
You would not known as the big ol boy,
that guy dolan out compliments again 

3452
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:30,210
write down.
There's not patrice is reputation,

3453
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:35,610
but anthony has that ability to reach in
and grab funny from anywhere and he's as

3454
02:23:35,611 --> 02:23:36,444
fast as any comic we've ever had on a.
There's never been a comedian in there 

3455
02:23:39,540 --> 02:23:40,373
who was faster than him.
They'd been as fast as him guys like 

3456
02:23:42,151 --> 02:23:45,030
patrice or burro genius,
but there's no one has ever been able to

3457
02:23:45,031 --> 02:23:46,440
go in there and run circles around 
anthony.

3458
02:23:47,080 --> 02:23:48,920
It's staggering how fucking funny that.
Yeah,

3459
02:23:48,970 --> 02:23:49,803
it is weird.
It's like he's a comic who never became 

3460
02:23:51,121 --> 02:23:51,954
a comic,
but that's how I've always felt about 

3461
02:23:53,491 --> 02:23:54,324
being around him and he even said that 
about him and dice was shitting on 

3462
02:23:56,881 --> 02:23:58,530
opiod.
Anthony when they had a few together,

3463
02:23:58,770 --> 02:23:59,603
he was saying that that anthony is 
actually talented and he's actually 

3464
02:24:02,251 --> 02:24:03,930
almost like a comic,
but he never did it.

3465
02:24:04,470 --> 02:24:05,303
He never did it.
and anthony has an ability brewers and 

3466
02:24:07,111 --> 02:24:10,320
amazing storyteller to an amazing 
storyteller.

3467
02:24:10,350 --> 02:24:13,320
Whereas aunt could do that about like he
can literally tell you.

3468
02:24:13,321 --> 02:24:14,310
he would talk about like,
you know,

3469
02:24:14,380 --> 02:24:18,270
being a tin knocker and stuff I have no 
knowledge of or interest in and,

3470
02:24:18,390 --> 02:24:21,420
and he would have me on the edge of my 
seat listening to him talk about it.

3471
02:24:21,421 --> 02:24:25,370
He just has a gift for explaining things
anD for walking you through it.

3472
02:24:25,380 --> 02:24:26,213
Louis has that.
The ability to explain an amazingly 

3473
02:24:28,021 --> 02:24:28,854
interesting fashion and anthony can just
jump in and out of voices and do 

3474
02:24:31,171 --> 02:24:33,010
impressions.
I mean,

3475
02:24:33,090 --> 02:24:33,923
I never get sick of rambling about him 
because I got to work with them for a 

3476
02:24:36,061 --> 02:24:36,894
fucking decade.
I got to work with the funniest guy in 

3477
02:24:38,011 --> 02:24:39,720
the fucking world for a decade.
Like,

3478
02:24:40,290 --> 02:24:43,320
as much as it sucks that it's over,
like I'm grateful.

3479
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:45,000
I just want to do it again.
One hundred percent.

3480
02:24:45,001 --> 02:24:47,610
Have you thought about doing that?
I would love to go with him and sam.

3481
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:49,380
I mean me and open don't get along 
anymore.

3482
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:51,360
Um,
but I would love to have anthony with me

3483
02:24:51,361 --> 02:24:52,320
and sam.
But again,

3484
02:24:52,321 --> 02:24:53,910
he's got his own show.
It's not going to happen,

3485
02:24:53,970 --> 02:24:54,803
but I love salmon.
I have a very good chemistry and a 

3486
02:24:57,541 --> 02:24:58,560
comfort level.
Like I,

3487
02:24:58,610 --> 02:25:02,130
I like him and I trusted him on the air 
and with opiate just got bad.

3488
02:25:02,131 --> 02:25:03,150
I'm not blaming him.
It's like,

3489
02:25:03,151 --> 02:25:04,380
hey,
I always have the problem too.

3490
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:06,510
But what about you doing a show with 
anthony?

3491
02:25:06,900 --> 02:25:08,730
Compound media,
compound media.

3492
02:25:08,731 --> 02:25:09,564
Is he get into a more enclosed 
environment than serious is and because 

3493
02:25:12,151 --> 02:25:13,920
of gigs and other things I got to 
promote.

3494
02:25:13,921 --> 02:25:14,754
I just kinda,
I wanted to stay and also serious pays 

3495
02:25:16,411 --> 02:25:18,300
more and I didn't want to negotiate 
against anthony.

3496
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:18,961
I just couldn't.
I was like,

3497
02:25:18,961 --> 02:25:19,794
hey,
I wasn't going to use him as a 

3498
02:25:20,611 --> 02:25:22,800
negotiation tactic.
I didn't want to do.

3499
02:25:22,801 --> 02:25:23,634
I couldn't do it.
I'm too close to him and I always kind 

3500
02:25:26,131 --> 02:25:26,964
of secretly wanted him to come back.
And when he came back the first day he 

3501
02:25:29,381 --> 02:25:33,580
came back.
I mean it was seeing that fucking I got,

3502
02:25:33,610 --> 02:25:34,443
I got the,
we went to a springsteen know who 

3503
02:25:35,981 --> 02:25:36,371
played.
Oh,

3504
02:25:36,371 --> 02:25:39,880
guns and roses played at the fucking the
apollo.

3505
02:25:40,300 --> 02:25:41,950
So this was like right after opening it 
to fire.

3506
02:25:41,990 --> 02:25:44,420
So I saw scott greenstein that night or 
andrew and like,

3507
02:25:44,421 --> 02:25:45,680
Yeah,
he can come in and kill me,

3508
02:25:45,681 --> 02:25:46,330
and I'm like,
really?

3509
02:25:46,330 --> 02:25:46,661
They're like,
yeah,

3510
02:25:46,661 --> 02:25:47,321
you can come in.
And I'm like,

3511
02:25:47,321 --> 02:25:48,450
great.
I texted him,

3512
02:25:48,451 --> 02:25:51,420
come in tomorrow,
the minute he could come in and uh,

3513
02:25:51,430 --> 02:25:55,570
but security hadn't been told so I'm on 
the show and I know ants coming in.

3514
02:25:55,570 --> 02:25:57,430
It's gonna be a fucking surprise for the
audience.

3515
02:25:57,970 --> 02:26:01,000
But he's being held up at security 
because in fairness they needed an email

3516
02:26:01,001 --> 02:26:04,720
from scott they didn't know that had 
been okayed and it took about an hour or

3517
02:26:04,721 --> 02:26:05,554
40 minutes,
but he got up and seeing him walk down 

3518
02:26:07,001 --> 02:26:08,230
that ah,
fuck.

3519
02:26:08,231 --> 02:26:10,890
it was so good.
He was happy.

3520
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:14,140
Very rarely see that on his face.
It was so good.

3521
02:26:14,260 --> 02:26:15,010
But,
but you,

3522
02:26:15,010 --> 02:26:15,843
you just go right back into that.
And sam is so perfect in that moment 

3523
02:26:19,001 --> 02:26:22,470
till you just kind of go back into it 
and you flow and you know.

3524
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:26,150
So I miss him a lot,
but uncensored conversations,

3525
02:26:26,180 --> 02:26:27,013
they're just hard to come by.
And When you're under the corporate 

3526
02:26:29,081 --> 02:26:31,120
umbrella,
you're not really uncensored.

3527
02:26:31,121 --> 02:26:33,390
There's always gonna be something that 
you can't say something,

3528
02:26:33,400 --> 02:26:34,233
get you in trouble,
which is why I was always encouraging 

3529
02:26:35,891 --> 02:26:36,880
you to do a podcast.

3530
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:38,560
Like wait,
even way back in the day,

3531
02:26:39,010 --> 02:26:39,843
I was like,
you should branch out and you should do 

3532
02:26:40,751 --> 02:26:43,270
something on the wrong side.
I feel like people wouldn't.

3533
02:26:43,271 --> 02:26:44,104
Why voice felt people wouldn't want it 
or they were sick of me or they're not 

3534
02:26:45,731 --> 02:26:47,140
interested.
but again,

3535
02:26:47,141 --> 02:26:49,450
the closest I've come at this point is 
fucking dumb.

3536
02:26:49,451 --> 02:26:50,860
Chip,
I made you my own sunday,

3537
02:26:50,861 --> 02:26:52,690
but I,
I'm literally loving doing that.

3538
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:55,330
It's freedom and it's fun.
Do what you love then,

3539
02:26:55,331 --> 02:26:56,800
but you know,
I mean,

3540
02:26:56,801 --> 02:26:59,170
I know you love doing the sam and jim 
show too,

3541
02:26:59,171 --> 02:27:00,004
but I really feel like even that show 
would be bigger if it was just 

3542
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:05,950
accessible to everybody and not on 
serious.

3543
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:07,450
It might be.
And again,

3544
02:27:07,451 --> 02:27:08,284
we have one more year left on the 
contract and it is something I would do 

3545
02:27:10,331 --> 02:27:12,790
as a podcast.
It absolutely is something I would do as

3546
02:27:12,791 --> 02:27:13,624
a podcast,
but they don't want to say one thing in 

3547
02:27:15,071 --> 02:27:15,550
their favor.

3548
02:27:15,550 --> 02:27:16,480
Besides the fact that like,
yeah,

3549
02:27:16,481 --> 02:27:19,150
there's human resources and you know,
you can't go around and fucking grabbing

3550
02:27:19,151 --> 02:27:22,840
clits they never fuck with us 
creatively.

3551
02:27:23,020 --> 02:27:23,853
Like literally never say nothing with 
condoleezza rice where you guys got 

3552
02:27:28,601 --> 02:27:31,180
kicked off the air.
that was a homeless guy.

3553
02:27:31,240 --> 02:27:33,730
Here's what that was,
that your right to homeless charlie.

3554
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:34,541
And he's like,
what?

3555
02:27:34,541 --> 02:27:35,650
Bad?
That bush bItch.

3556
02:27:35,710 --> 02:27:39,100
He was just a funny fucking dude.
Here's how that got pushed.

3557
02:27:39,101 --> 02:27:42,700
That was before sirius xm merged and 
what sunk,

3558
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:43,583
what it will almost happened was that 
made it to fucking brietbart or 

3559
02:27:46,051 --> 02:27:50,710
breitbart and then got onto drudge and 
then became a big deal and I heard later

3560
02:27:50,711 --> 02:27:51,544
that the people who were making that a 
story where the people who worked in 

3561
02:27:54,130 --> 02:27:58,180
terrestrial radio who did not want that 
merger to happen.

3562
02:27:58,510 --> 02:27:59,343
So the only reason the company pulled 
him off if they were literally scared 

3563
02:28:02,050 --> 02:28:02,883
that it was going to hurt whatever they 
needed in congress for fucking two to 

3564
02:28:06,011 --> 02:28:06,580
make the merger.

3565
02:28:06,580 --> 02:28:07,413
Haptics.
I'm serious.

3566
02:28:07,790 --> 02:28:09,520
So they were saying it was a merger in 
danger.

3567
02:28:09,521 --> 02:28:12,160
Like once that got out there and fucking
either way,

3568
02:28:12,161 --> 02:28:15,490
we shouldn't have been off the air,
but I'm as crazy as it was,

3569
02:28:15,491 --> 02:28:19,450
that's where terrestrial radio saved us 
because k rock who they wanted to be off

3570
02:28:19,451 --> 02:28:20,760
the fucking show.
Those cons.

3571
02:28:20,770 --> 02:28:22,910
I hate that they wanted you.
Yeah,

3572
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:24,033
because the ratings weren't as good as 
they used to be and they thought I was 

3573
02:28:25,911 --> 02:28:27,190
the probleM.
Let's say.

3574
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:28,033
Hey fucking shit heads.
I was there in the afternoon when we'd 

3575
02:28:29,380 --> 02:28:32,030
be for syndication.
I was loving anthea before they're ever.

3576
02:28:32,210 --> 02:28:33,140
I love people go like,
yeah,

3577
02:28:33,141 --> 02:28:33,920
dude,
you suck.

3578
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,510
I remember philadelphia before you were 
on.

3579
02:28:35,570 --> 02:28:37,790
No you don't.
It didn't happen before I was on.

3580
02:28:38,180 --> 02:28:39,830
There was no philly shell before I was 
on.

3581
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:42,410
I was always there and syndication,
so whatever.

3582
02:28:42,411 --> 02:28:43,400
anyway,
they went to bergen once.

3583
02:28:43,430 --> 02:28:44,780
People are.
I know,

3584
02:28:44,781 --> 02:28:45,471
I know.
I know.

3585
02:28:45,471 --> 02:28:46,050
I know.
I do that.

3586
02:28:46,050 --> 02:28:47,870
I literally will do that alone.
I,

3587
02:28:47,871 --> 02:28:49,060
I,
I don't.

3588
02:28:49,190 --> 02:28:51,800
I didn't realize that people don't talk 
to themselves.

3589
02:28:52,460 --> 02:28:56,340
I didn't realize that.
And with chip and the character's eyes,

3590
02:28:56,510 --> 02:29:00,620
and I've talked about this on our show,
I do it all the time by myself.

3591
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:04,830
You have conversations with full blown 
chip edgar.

3592
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:07,310
Oh,
full volume talking.

3593
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:08,773
I'll little them and character not once 
in a while if I think of something is 

3594
02:29:11,121 --> 02:29:13,230
dead.
Girls say it in a lot of sector.

3595
02:29:13,410 --> 02:29:14,330
Yeah.
He's another one.

3596
02:29:14,331 --> 02:29:16,490
He's a bad character and he's just has 
dry teeth.

3597
02:29:16,660 --> 02:29:20,810
He said there's not a whole lot to them,
but I would do them because anthony is,

3598
02:29:21,140 --> 02:29:24,020
he touches you with a sharp fingernails.
It's an ugly thing.

3599
02:29:24,110 --> 02:29:25,400
Uh,
and uncle paul,

3600
02:29:25,401 --> 02:29:26,181
I,
I do them.

3601
02:29:26,181 --> 02:29:27,440
And you do them when you're alone.

3602
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:28,640
Completely alone.
Wow.

3603
02:29:28,670 --> 02:29:30,560
And I do.
When I'm alone,

3604
02:29:30,561 --> 02:29:32,110
if I drop something,
I'll go,

3605
02:29:32,660 --> 02:29:33,493
oh,
okay.

3606
02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:34,783
That's about it.
I'll walk around and talk to myself and 

3607
02:29:37,431 --> 02:29:39,860
full blown conversation like,
uh,

3608
02:29:40,450 --> 02:29:41,283
this,
this is not.

3609
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:42,353
I have actually embarrassed this.
I took a shit today and I got up and I 

3610
02:29:45,201 --> 02:29:46,034
was done and I,
I went to the fucking to look at my 

3611
02:29:48,081 --> 02:29:50,330
computer and I had to shit again 
immediately.

3612
02:29:50,510 --> 02:29:52,100
And I stood up and out loud.
I said,

3613
02:29:52,250 --> 02:29:53,990
oh,
that's just jostled a little more loose,

3614
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:59,150
and I walked back to the toilet.
I said those words to myself alone.

3615
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:00,920
I do it all the time,
dude.

3616
02:30:00,950 --> 02:30:03,050
I talk and I didn't know.
I thought everyone did that,

3617
02:30:03,740 --> 02:30:04,461
but sam's like,
no,

3618
02:30:04,461 --> 02:30:06,860
I'll think things,
but I don't say them.

3619
02:30:06,980 --> 02:30:07,813
Yeah,
I would imagine most people think 

3620
02:30:08,631 --> 02:30:10,640
things,
but a few people talk to themselves.

3621
02:30:10,910 --> 02:30:14,330
I'm sure I've done it on occasion,
but it's not a normal in the shower.

3622
02:30:14,331 --> 02:30:17,300
I do it out loud just for conversation 
to me when I'm alone,

3623
02:30:17,301 --> 02:30:20,270
I'm happy to not talk.
I talked so fucking much.

3624
02:30:20,271 --> 02:30:21,104
I talk so much doing a podcast so much 
doing stand up so much doing ufc 

3625
02:30:24,141 --> 02:30:27,410
commentary when I can not talk at all.
I'm fucking happy.

3626
02:30:27,470 --> 02:30:29,060
Yeah.
I don't know what it is.

3627
02:30:29,061 --> 02:30:32,440
It's like things that just kind of come 
out or I work through things or I worked

3628
02:30:32,450 --> 02:30:33,740
through this girlfriends argument,
you know,

3629
02:30:33,741 --> 02:30:37,670
whatever it is in the moment,
and I logically talk things through,

3630
02:30:38,570 --> 02:30:39,403
but yeah,
that's where a lot of the characters 

3631
02:30:39,771 --> 02:30:40,604
should come from is.
I'll start thinking of it and I'll talk 

3632
02:30:42,201 --> 02:30:45,470
in a weird voice and there'll be 
something that resonates with me and I'm

3633
02:30:45,471 --> 02:30:47,420
like,
I'm stuck in my head man.

3634
02:30:47,660 --> 02:30:48,493
And once It's stuck in my head down,
I bring it out on the air and that's 

3635
02:30:51,231 --> 02:30:52,490
when it gets stuck in everybody else's 
head.

3636
02:30:52,490 --> 02:30:54,480
Like if it's bothering me for a month,
it's,

3637
02:30:54,560 --> 02:30:55,610
you're going to hate it,
you know?

3638
02:30:55,611 --> 02:30:56,444
And I like to bring that stuff out.
That's what I have to check comes from 

3639
02:30:59,541 --> 02:31:02,960
just being single and lonely.
I've got to wrap this up.

3640
02:31:02,961 --> 02:31:05,260
Okay.
There will be so much fun with joe.

3641
02:31:05,510 --> 02:31:06,560
Always a good time,
brother.

3642
02:31:06,561 --> 02:31:07,550
AnytIme you're in town,
man,

3643
02:31:07,551 --> 02:31:08,960
just let me know.
Let's do this more often.

3644
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:13,430
Can I play my nearly room?
Only all tickets are on sale if you want

3645
02:31:13,431 --> 02:31:14,340
to go.
And uh,

3646
02:31:14,360 --> 02:31:15,193
I'm in dallas and austin this week and 
the money's going to the hurricane 

3647
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:19,040
victims.
I hate saying that.

3648
02:31:19,050 --> 02:31:21,840
It feels cheesy,
but I feel worse going into prostituting

3649
02:31:21,841 --> 02:31:23,040
tickets,
right?

3650
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:23,910
Um,

3651
02:31:23,910 --> 02:31:24,743
go to the,
a check being sam out or go to jim 

3652
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:27,840
norton.com
and I'll go to the chip.

3653
02:31:27,841 --> 02:31:29,430
Chip person,
riot casts,

3654
02:31:29,431 --> 02:31:32,270
youtube has all the chip podcasts up 
there and uh,

3655
02:31:32,370 --> 02:31:33,203

this week is going to be a fucking 

3656
02:31:34,350 --> 02:31:36,500
doozy.
thanks norton.

3657

Ladies and gentlemen.
