1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,550
Hello Freak bitches.
You know,

2
00:00:03,551 --> 00:00:04,630
my brother,
uh,

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,790
uh,
he was,

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,730
he passed away.
My brother was a,

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,700
uh,
uh,

6
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,890
uh,
I kind of say a hundred,

7
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:13,030
but he was actually a poacher.
My brother,

8
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,630
when he passed away,
uh,

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,920
people said,
hey,

10
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:18,754
can,
um,

11
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,130
can I have your dope permit?
And I was like,

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
what?
He's like,

13
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,850
my brother had been getting a dope 
permit in my name for like 20 years.

14
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:28,781
Oh,
really?

15
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:29,201
Yeah.
Yeah.

16
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:31,050
He had all these forge dope.
It's,

17
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,750
he shot animals all year long.
He didn't read the game.

18
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:35,584
Warden would bust into his home with a 
bolt lock cutters and crack open his 

19
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:44,110
freezer and there'd be all this game out
of season.

20
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,910
Oh Man.
He,

21
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:46,661
uh,
yeah,

22
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:47,494
but you know,
he ate it.

23
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,850
Right.
But he,

24
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:49,690
uh,
yeah.

25
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,060
Yeah.
He didn't abide by the rules.

26
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:52,990
Well,
no,

27
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,913
no,
it did not abide by anyone's rules is 

28
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:58,660
his funeral was,
uh,

29
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,240
it was awesome and Eclectic,
but there's two things.

30
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,670
Someone should've given me a heads up.
Well,

31
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,563
first of all,
a couple of the pallbearers were in 

32
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:11,290
Cammo.
Really?

33
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,730
Yeah.
Had a serious hunter.

34
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,020
Oh,
hunter biker.

35
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,230
Where do you live?
Uh,

36
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,700
central New York and Syracuse and then 
Rome and around.

37
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:19,990
But you know,
I love my brother,

38
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:21,290
but he was wild.
And,

39
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,124
and then the other thing,
they probably should have given me a 

40
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:28,681
heads up that it's friend a little.
Ricky was one of the pallbearers.

41
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,340
Yeah,
he was,

42
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:34,600
uh,
uh,

43
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,133
I just like,
um,

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,530
I don't want to use the word,
I was going to say,

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,970
he's like a Munchkin.
Good,

46
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:42,100
safe.
I didn't want to use the other word.

47
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,260
I mean,
he wasn't a tiny person.

48
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,090
It's a little person.
He wasn't a dwarf,

49
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:49,420
but because he was regular size almost,
I don't know.

50
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:51,880
He was tiny,
but he didn't look,

51
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,080
you know,
I mean I get it,

52
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,610
but nobody said ricky was going to be a 
pallbearer or give me a heads up.

53
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:58,444
So I looked down the end of the church.
He's in the middle on one side of the 

54
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:04,170
casket and then middle.
Yeah.

55
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,300
And I said to my daughter,
go,

56
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,660
looks like Ricky's riding a subway.

57
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,170
My Dad,
he's like,

58
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,153
I think he just got air.
And so the brace is going on about how 

59
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:21,190
my brother Tommy loved the outdoors.
And He loved animals.

60
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,380
And then I went on after the breeze,
I go,

61
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,460
father,
I don't want to be impolite,

62
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,240
but my,
my brother was like to kill animals.

63
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,650
There's a lot of deer right now in the 
woods going,

64
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,320
whoo,
whoo.

65
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,420
Upstate New York.
So very dear rich place.

66
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:40,550
People don't have a lot of tolerance,
those animals,

67
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,010
a lot of car accidents.
Well,

68
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,310
there's a lot.
And there was more now than when I was a

69
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,620
kid.
But when,

70
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:49,131
uh,
you know,

71
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:50,100
Tony Vee,
Boston,

72
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,030
Tony,
I went up to visit my brother.

73
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,080
I had given him some money to buy some 
windows for his house.

74
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,310
It's a long story,
but he lived,

75
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,820
this is what he's really in the woods.
And,

76
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:04,000
uh,
we pull up to his yard and there's just,

77
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:07,090
um,
there's just corn growing.

78
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,983
Like there's no rows.
It's his whole front and backyard of 

79
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,490
corn.
Like there's like psycho coin.

80
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,140
There's no rows or anything.
Right.

81
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,453
And uh,
and Tony didn't know my brother and he 

82
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,371
comes out and he goes,
hey,

83
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,570
what's,
what's up with the court?

84
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:20,620
And he's like,
oh,

85
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,180
it's for the dear bobby.
You know,

86
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,830
he's like a,
and Tony's like,

87
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,820
oh,
you help them through the winter.

88
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:25,391
He's like,
no,

89
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:30,030
I'm blast.
Him and my brother actually made he just

90
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,040
house.
Yeah.

91
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,960
Oh that's so fucked up.
And I go,

92
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,630
I'm in the bathroom in the new window is
cracked.

93
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,190
Did I go tell me what happened to this 
new windows you have bob,

94
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:41,024
you had a little problem with recoil.
So my brother would sit on the toilet 

95
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,260
and shoot deer.
Swear to God,

96
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,100
swear to God.

97
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,970
I'm sure he's probably burned in one,
two taking a shit.

98
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,060
You want to go hunt and you know,
meet me in the kitchen,

99
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,510
you know?
And then then one time,

100
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,810
him and his friends really high and 
they,

101
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,190
they just turn this a station wagon and 
doing convertible.

102
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,810
Would the heel yard torches and then 
they would use that.

103
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,000
That was their hunting moby?
Yeah.

104
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:19,850
That was their term car.
They're driving and shoot out of it.

105
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,930
Oh my God.
Yeah,

106
00:04:20,931 --> 00:04:21,471
yeah.
Oh,

107
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:23,060
so I brought this part of the story,
so,

108
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,650
so,
so Tony Visconti,

109
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,550
you'd brothers certified,
but like you said,

110
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,400
been around my brother.
So he goes to Tony.

111
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,800
Tony and I get back Gar and we're 
heading to her.

112
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:34,634
The car in the,
Tony sees this woodchuck across the 

113
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:37,224
street until he goes,
what is that chucky would chuck and 

114
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:42,984
then,
um,

115
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,360
and then we're not even down the end of 
the driveway.

116
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,470
Tony's going,
I just figured that would shut yo man,

117
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,770
that would just dead.
You dropped it.

118
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:55,604
The home on net.
We'll check you fingered that would 

119
00:04:57,411 --> 00:05:02,411
check that his family is going to go 
papa papa coming to the door.

120
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,430
Yeah,
my brother,

121
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,900
God rest his soul.
He was a wild man.

122
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,080
Wild for living.
He was a sheet metal worker and uh,

123
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,380
you know,
he rode bikes for a long time.

124
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,790
He was always a,
you know,

125
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,580
there was always our home when I was a 
kid was like,

126
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:21,720
you know,
the movie mask,

127
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,630
you know,
it was just always bikes and motor clubs

128
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:27,150
will come over to the house and keg 
parties and stuff like that.

129
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,260
Whoa.
Yeah,

130
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,393
yeah.
It helped me to go to the bigfoot 

131
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,243
conference.
No,

132
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,050
hell yeah.
So that's what I grew up with.

133
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:34,884
You know,
guys name like low life and all these 

134
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:36,600
guys.

135
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,430
And My mother was great because they 
would come in,

136
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,270
you know,
uh,

137
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,423
uh,
my mother was sweet because she would 

138
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:42,660
know,
only know their,

139
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,440
you know,
their bike or names.

140
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,520
Yeah.
And so he's,

141
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,530
you know,
hello shithead.

142
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,500
Yeah,
exactly.

143
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:51,060
It would be like,
you're like a low life.

144
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:53,730
Showed up with a shirt that said 
Harley's the vast fuck the rest.

145
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:55,980
And he's like low life,
not in my house.

146
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,360
So it was a g and they had turned the 
sure not.

147
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,194
Yeah.
So I grew up with bikers and it wasn't 

148
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:05,030
until later on I realized,
Oh,

149
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,620
you know,
some bikers aren't Rad.

150
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:07,454
You know what I mean?
Like,

151
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,560
you know,
oh,

152
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:10,260
I see.
I mean,

153
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,120
look at my him.
I will,

154
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:11,811
hey,
how are you?

155
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:12,621
Like,
you're a nice guy,

156
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,690
so you associate me.
They're always nice.

157
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,210
It'd been like cool fun.
Yes.

158
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,260
And my brother had a lot of clout in 
that world,

159
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,790
so yes,
everyone was cool.

160
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,780
But,
and then later on I was like,

161
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,340
oh,
some of these guys aren't so awesome.

162
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,100
But so basically bikers are like bears 
at the dump.

163
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,480
Like they look cool,
but stay in the,

164
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,763
okay.
