1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,020
Goes to show you,

2
00:00:01,021 --> 00:00:02,430
I'm going to find that we're back up.

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:02,941
Sorry.

4
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:05,910
You stream how tweet
everybody we're back up.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,193
Yeah.

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:12,441
Yeah.

7
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:13,470
So the um,

8
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,240
you know that the way that the Shamans
continued explaining fifth dimension is

9
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:18,074
the dream state.

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:18,710
Um,

11
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,220
that's you access that sleeping and you
also access that on a general level in

12
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:23,450
psychedelic experiences.

13
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,310
Sixth dimension is the realm,

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,000
um,

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,900
is the spirit realm.

16
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,793
And uh,

17
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,160
the kind of the master that realm is
the earth mother is nature itself.

18
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,540
So the snakes that came,

19
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,201
that yields,

20
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:33,770
that came,

21
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,820
that's the fifth amendment.

22
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,370
The sixth,

23
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:35,841
sixth,

24
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:36,561
that's the sixth.

25
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:38,000
And what are we in?

26
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,440
We're in the third,

27
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:43,190
third and fourth time
operates Taj just time,

28
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,083
linear time.

29
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,640
And was in the fifth is the dream state.

30
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,510
The dream state.

31
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,080
Dream state.

32
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,230
The collective unconsciousness
of all humankind is the fifth.

33
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:52,250
And that's why when you dream,

34
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:54,290
you can access things outside of yourself.

35
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,423
Um,

36
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:55,940
you know,

37
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,790
think of things that you wouldn't have
thought of because if somebody else had

38
00:00:58,791 --> 00:00:59,624
ever thought of it,

39
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,141
you know,

40
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:02,000
you can access that in
the fifth dimension,

41
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,710
the dream state outside of time.

42
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,930
So then the sixth is,

43
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,230
you know,

44
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,220
that's the spirit realm.

45
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:10,820
That's where if you're going
to communicate with any
of these totem animals or

46
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:11,840
guides or anything,

47
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,880
and they actually say when you smoked DMT,

48
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,660
you get kind of dropped directly
right in the sixth dimension.

49
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,440
And there's beings in there that you see
and it's very common report from people

50
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:23,600
smoking Dmt did you see beings?

51
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,100
And it's because you get rocket shipped
directly into the sixth dimension where

52
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:32,120
you're going to encounter these different
beings that exist in that dimension.

53
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,680
Um,

54
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,940
but the overlord of that kind of
dimension is his mother earth.

55
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,510
So a lot of the things you see
are kind of animalistic based,

56
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:39,590
especially for the people in the,

57
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,610
in the junk.

58
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,290
Maybe there's different paradigms of that.

59
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:46,520
But then the seventh dimension
beyond that is the realm of energy,

60
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,060
uh,

61
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,260
energetic vibration and
large and large entities.

62
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,250
And that's where they say the ships came
from for me was the seventh dimension.

63
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,300
And the purpose of the ships was to
prepare me for travel to the eighth

64
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:00,134
dimension,

65
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,810
which is the realm of pure potentiality,

66
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:03,530
they call it,

67
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,310
where you can really affect change
on all the dimensions before,

68
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:10,460
including the third and the fourth
affect change in the physical body.

69
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,440
Basically access,

70
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:13,760
see things in your life,

71
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,430
have a completely different
perspective outside of time.

72
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,380
And that's the eighth dimension.

73
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:18,970
Um,

74
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,960
kind of the final dimension
that you can arrive.

75
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:21,640
So,

76
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,030
um,

77
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,250
you know,

78
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,190
they explained this all after after
I had went through and then said,

79
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:25,431
okay,

80
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:27,080
this was where you were here.

81
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,280
This is why you're here.

82
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:28,941
And,

83
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:29,211
uh,

84
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:30,044
you know what,

85
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,240
based on my experience,

86
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:32,300
it might all sound crazy,

87
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:33,890
but it's a paradigm that,

88
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,000
that seems to work for me because I
lived it and I was there and I did it.

89
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:38,834
And I saw,

90
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,530
you know,

91
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,420
I've seen the physical benefits of
what happened when I got to be eight

92
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:42,831
dimensioned.

93
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:45,320
It wasn't like I just got there
and no good stuff happened.

94
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:45,740
I mean,

95
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,371
my business,

96
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:47,330
the decisions I've made,

97
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,440
I've been huge.

98
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,711
You know,

99
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:49,700
things are going really well.

100
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,660
My health is great.

101
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,320
Uh,

102
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,951
my buddy's good,

103
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:52,461
but who knows,

104
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:53,540
that wasn't very scientific.

105
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,760
I'm not going to put that
one up in the win column.

106
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,450
Uh,

107
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:56,990
cause I didn't.

108
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,823
I'm not,

109
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,311
you know,

110
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,190
I'm not that

111
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,410
what we experience in a hallucination in,

112
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:09,550
in that form isn't absolutely real,

113
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,400
but it's just we can't put it in a box.

114
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:12,730
Yeah,

115
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,490
you can't,

116
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,410
you can't weigh it.

117
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,660
You can't hit it with a hammer,

118
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:16,950
you know,

119
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,800
making noise,

120
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,430
you know?

121
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:18,790
Yeah.

122
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,290
But it's the idea that
is just your imagination.

123
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,800
People like poo poo that like
it's just your imagination.

124
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,470
What is your imagination man?

125
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,140
Your imagination is a crazy fucking thing.

126
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,380
All these neurons and cells are firing
and somehow or another through these

127
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:43,291
ideas manifest themselves or they can
manifest themselves as solid objects.

128
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,590
Like the person had figured
out the wheel or the guy wore,

129
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,940
makes a fucking computer.

130
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,120
These are all real things
that have somehow another
emerged into this dimension

131
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,760
from this ether old dimension of thoughts
and ideas and done it through a human

132
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,210
being.

133
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,110
And we look at it as like,

134
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:02,650
no big deal.

135
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:02,890
Like,

136
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,340
oh,

137
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,720
he thought of it and then he made it.

138
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:05,920
It's just his imagination.

139
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,980
Oh you were in the eighth dimension.

140
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,833
Sure you were.

141
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,090
That's just your imagination.

142
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,250
What the fuck is your imagination?

143
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,620
We are very light with our,

144
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:20,621
our appreciation of that and very light
with are very lax with our all as far as

145
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,330
what,

146
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,120
what the,

147
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,380
the dimension of the
imaginations brings us.

148
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,220
I mean it's,

149
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,080
that's a crazy fucking thing.

150
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,680
The idea that the uh,

151
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:35,681
the world of thoughts and ideas is
actually some sort of an intangible

152
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,310
experience that's like right there.

153
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,260
And from that you can pull things out
and create them in and put them and then

154
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:46,690
you stack them up on top
of each other and you know,

155
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:47,800
and then their physical,

156
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,300
they become a different thing.

157
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,920
But it's from the imagination.

158
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,080
Everything is from the imagination.

159
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,670
So the idea you saying,

160
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:54,881
you know,

161
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:55,620
anybody that would,

162
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:55,910
you know,

163
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,470
critique it.

164
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,520
Oh you saw drag Lawrence.

165
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,220
Sure you're doing it.

166
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,053
You saw snakes.

167
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,640
That's just your imagination.

168
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,070
I don't know what that exactly means.

169
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,461
You know,

170
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:03,681
when,

171
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:04,930
when you see something,

172
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:09,820
even if it's a hallucination and
it's changing your fucking life,

173
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,940
cause it's whatever it's teaching you
or whatever it's showing you or whatever

174
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:20,161
leverage that it uses to pry your ego's
grasp free of your life for whatever

175
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:26,080
amount of time that allows you to sort
of reset your rpms and fucking start a

176
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,850
new with fresh purpose.

177
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,260
That's real.

178
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,800
Yeah.

179
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,030
That's fucking real.

180
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,480
That UFO you saw was real.

181
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,230
It was real.

182
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,100
You know what I'm saying?

183
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,500
What the fuck is the imagination?

184
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:43,501
Does someone have to pour alloy into a
mold and carve those things on it for it

185
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:44,440
to be real?

186
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,670
Do you have to be able to walk up and hit
it and make a claim for it to be real?

187
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,870
No.

188
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,940
It's just how it interacts with you.

189
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,870
Any kind of invention was
made from your imagination,

190
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:56,470
so.

191
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:56,930
Sure.

192
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,651
So it's like,

193
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:58,390
who cares

194
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,570
if,

195
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:58,651
if,

196
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:01,370
if they teach you how to make
the next fucking computer,

197
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,840
then don't say,

198
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:03,441
who cares?

199
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:04,400
It's just your imagination.

200
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:07,460
Cause that shit might teach
you something just like these,

201
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,850
uh,

202
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,683
tools from,

203
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:08,991
from,

204
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:09,291
you know,

205
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,430
the Egyptian Times.

206
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,170
They were,

207
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,003
you know,

208
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,120
tools out of their imagination.

209
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,391
Yeah.

210
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:16,340
And if you believe in things,

211
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,600
if you believe in things,

212
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,520
they have incredible power over you.

213
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,150
Yeah.

214
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,560
Both good and bad.

215
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,580
You know?

216
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,530
And who's to say that's not real.

217
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,041
You know,

218
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,520
there's like the,

219
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,410
the idea of the placebo effect.

220
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:30,020
Like I give you a sugar pill and all
of a sudden you feel better because you

221
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:31,280
thought I gave you medicine.

222
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,091
Well,

223
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,470
still you feel better.

224
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,190
You know,

225
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,870
people have actually been cured of
ailments because of the placebo effect.

226
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,880
So what the fuck is
happening where people,

227
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,270
people have this misconception
that it works only one way.

228
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,870
That you know that the
body can affect the mind,

229
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:49,310
but the mind can affect the body.

230
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:49,611
Oh No,

231
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:51,200
you can't go backwards on that road,

232
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:51,921
but it's bullshit.

233
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:52,161
I mean,

234
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,380
your mind can make changes in your body.

235
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,214
How do you think these,

236
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,611
you know,

237
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:59,420
these people are able to do things like
slow their heart rate or walk on coals

238
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,410
and not get burned.

239
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,760
I mean,

240
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,180
it's,

241
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,720
they're able to focus some kind of
walked down coals who's to trick.

242
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,621
Maybe it is.

243
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:07,300
I don't think,

244
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,270
I've never walked on calls,

245
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:09,000
but whatever,

246
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,010
you just gotta keep moving.

247
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,330
Well,

248
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,110
what they can do things with pain.

249
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,860
I mean you should have these people who
go to trans and really kind of stop the

250
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:16,461
pain from,

251
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:16,580
uh,

252
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,750
from affecting women and certain people
whose beliefs of certainly heal things

253
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:22,160
that the doctors thought were impossible.

254
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:26,330
But the idea that the mind can't affect
the body I think is one of the biggest

255
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:28,550
problems and misconceptions
in western medicine.

256
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,650
It's certainly Ken,

257
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,010
we all know people who are super,

258
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:31,701
super negative,

259
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,200
one up getting really sick too.

260
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,760
That's,

261
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,421
that's real.

262
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:35,900
There's,

263
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,830
I've had moments in my life where my,

264
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,550
I was too stressed out
and I wasn't balanced.

265
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,770
And those are almost always the moments
where you want them getting sick.

266
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,930
And there's a direct
correlation between that.

267
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,411
You know,

268
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:49,310
there's a direct correlation
between positive energy
and positive results in the

269
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:50,180
physical form.

270
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,540
Yeah.

271
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:50,781
You know,

272
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:51,710
they're all connected.

273
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,500
One of the DMT trips that I had never,

274
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,770
never forget this because it was
a real life changing experience.

275
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,760
Um,

276
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,031
you know,

277
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:02,990
the DMT trip is like being shot through
a cannon to the center of the universe

278
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:05,720
and all of a sudden you have all the
information around you all the time,

279
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,300
but it's like they're slippery dolphins.

280
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:09,380
He can't grab them.

281
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:10,970
It's like all the information's there,

282
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:13,130
but it's like you can't harness it.

283
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:13,580
You don't,

284
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,420
you can't figure it out.

285
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,980
And it's very,

286
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:19,280
very overwhelming and
it can be terrifying.

287
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,830
And in one trip that I had,

288
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,490
I got real scared in the middle of it
and I started thinking all this negative

289
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:26,324
shit.

290
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,680
It just got away from me.

291
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,903
And um,

292
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,340
as I was thinking all this negative shit,

293
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,520
the DMT trip became black and green and
dark and it became like Jag id and then

294
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,883
it just like,

295
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,120
it just looked harsh and it,

296
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,830
it looked like it started
to be almost like cancerous.

297
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,590
It looked like it was growing and it was,

298
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:52,020
it was moving in in an asymmetrical way.

299
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:53,120
It was just fucked up.

300
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:53,540
It was.

301
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,380
And then I realized,

302
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:54,651
okay,

303
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,730
this you're thinking negative,

304
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:58,380
stop thinking negative,

305
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,060
think positive,

306
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,500
relax,

307
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:02,041
let go.

308
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,870
And as I'm saying all these things,

309
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,990
the colors are slowly changing and then
when I completely relaxed and went boom

310
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,440
and it blossomed into these
beautiful geometric patterns.

311
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,920
It's like once I started
thinking positive and going,

312
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,370
oh,

313
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:17,611
okay,

314
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:18,331
this is just silly.

315
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:19,590
You can control your mind.

316
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,160
Think Po,

317
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,993
let go,

318
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,020
love,

319
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,033
love,

320
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,263
boom,

321
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,163
boom.

322
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,780
It like showed me in a physical form,

323
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,500
like something that I could
actually look at and watch.

324
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,620
I could see negative energy and positive
energy and that the lesson was that

325
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:39,960
these can be controlled
to a certain extent.

326
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:43,680
They can be managed and they can certainly
be managed by your intent and your

327
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:44,910
attitude and your ideas.

328
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,740
Yeah,

329
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,550
no doubt about it.

330
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,383
I mean that's a,

331
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,200
it's a powerful lesson to learn
is to be able to manage that.

332
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:52,130
Not only when you're on,

333
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,270
I mean it's psychedelic.

334
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:53,810
That's like,

335
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,920
that's like when you're in the,

336
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,020
that's the real game time,

337
00:09:57,021 --> 00:09:57,171
you know,

338
00:09:57,171 --> 00:09:58,070
that's the playoffs.

339
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:01,040
That's when you need to bring all your
training and practice to bear because

340
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:01,580
it's,

341
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,750
everything is magnified.

342
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:03,800
You're under the microcosm.

343
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,660
You know you don't in
a real intense moment,

344
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,180
you don't know yourself until you
have a psychedelic experience.

345
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:10,440
You might think you know yourself,

346
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,460
but I guarantee you you're going to find
out who you really fucking art when you

347
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:15,260
go deep.

348
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,390
And then when you go deep and you come
back and you have to kind of assess

349
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:21,150
everything and you look at
yourself through fresh eyes,

350
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,940
the the ego while you're sleeping,

351
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:24,930
while you're working,

352
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,940
while it's gaining ground,

353
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,590
it's like the fucking fed.

354
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,390
It's stealing money and just pocketing
things and taking control over certain

355
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:34,050
areas.

356
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,280
It really is like the government,

357
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,050
and then you don't realize how fucking
embedded it's becoming your system until

358
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:41,280
you have a blowout.

359
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,660
He till have a psychedelic boom blow
out experience and that ego good.

360
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:46,770
Just shut the side.

361
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,280
Like,

362
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,521
you know,

363
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:52,020
like a fucking explosion and a comic book
movie and the Ego's sitting in a tree

364
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:52,441
with half,

365
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:55,650
it's close off hanging from branches
because it just got blown out,

366
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,460
you know?

367
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,030
Then,

368
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,710
then you get to see yourself again.

369
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,390
Then you get to see who you really are.

370
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,210
But the time off of that man,

371
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:05,700
you gotta be real
careful because that ego,

372
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:07,350
he fucking gets out of that tree,

373
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,120
fucking brushes himself off and clings
a whole deal and starts running shit

374
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:12,511
again.

375
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,460
Listen to it be a lot easier
to just let me handle this.

376
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:14,941
I got this,

377
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:15,601
I got this dude,

378
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:16,470
you're the shit.

379
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,930
Okay you're going to do this
because you're the fucking man.

380
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:19,321
Trust me,

381
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:19,831
have a seat,

382
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:20,610
I'm going to drive.

383
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,110
And then next thing you know the
fucking Egos in control again,

384
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,380
your life is fucking confusing.

385
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,770
I think that's why it happens.

386
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:28,630
Even to the Shamans,

387
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,630
you know the masters,

388
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,100
this is not something that they're,

389
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:31,960
you know,

390
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,570
void of,

391
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:32,751
you know,

392
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:36,560
cause they get a lot of power in their
little communities and things and so the

393
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:38,030
medicine has to bring them back.

394
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,480
Well you're,

395
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,970
you're a spiritual person,

396
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:41,050
but you're also,

397
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,830
I mean the idea of spiritual did
the word is a weird tainted word.

398
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,420
Unfortunately the word spiritual,

399
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:47,254
so tainted,

400
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:47,830
you know,

401
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,120
automatically hippy nonsense comes
into play when you start using that.

402
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,180
But the line is your,

403
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,450
you are thoughts and ideas,

404
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:57,460
but you were also a physical,

405
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:02,410
biological being a vehicle and
just like your fucking car.

406
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:06,120
We have to change the oil and you have
to make sure that spark plugs are in

407
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,040
[inaudible] setting correctly and
make sure that the computers tuned up.

408
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,311
Uh,

409
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,290
you have to do that
with your body as well.

410
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,870
Your body is a vehicle
and if you ignore it,

411
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,190
much like your fucking car started
spewing out black smoke and shits out and

412
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:19,180
dies on the road,

413
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,300
your body does the same goddamn
thing it's your car can do.

414
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:24,040
If you don't maintain it correctly,

415
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,120
it will fuck with you.

416
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,350
It will fuck with you.

417
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:27,011
And you know,

418
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:29,680
and the ego is a part
of the physical body.

419
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,221
You know,

420
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:32,410
it doesn't seem like it is because again,

421
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:33,640
you can't fucking measure it.

422
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:35,170
You can't beat on it with a hammer.

423
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,670
But it is a part of who every fucking
living organism that wants to stay alive,

424
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:40,660
that has a conscious,

425
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,920
a consciousness and has the ability to
recognize that it's here that has self

426
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:45,754
awareness.

427
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,190
The Ego comes into play because
that's how you stay alive.

428
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,360
That's how you succeed.

429
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:50,500
That's how you get girls.

430
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,820
That's how you fucking get money.

431
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,691
You get money,

432
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:54,010
you work for the ego.

433
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:55,300
The Ego is,

434
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,070
it's a part of the machine,

435
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,510
but it can get away from you.

436
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,090
You've,

437
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,830
you know what you're saying there,

438
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,830
it touches on the very core of
my entire philosophy in life,

439
00:13:03,831 --> 00:13:04,670
which is balanced.

440
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:04,911
You know,

441
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:06,230
and that's what the warrior poet is.

442
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:07,060
It's the,

443
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,280
you know,

444
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,920
it's the Samurai that appreciates
the cherry blossom tree.

445
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:10,161
You know,

446
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:10,870
it's the,

447
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,570
it's gladiator when he's walking
through the fields of wheat and in,

448
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:14,871
you know,

449
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:19,370
appreciating that it's the ability to
maintain that kind of balance of both the

450
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:22,190
physical side and the
spiritual side and a,

451
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:23,060
and really that's,

452
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,000
I think the message I
had one message to bring.

453
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:27,290
It's like you got to have both.

454
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,860
You can't just be this spiritual being
only and go on these trips and stuff.

455
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,120
You got to hone your body.

456
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:33,110
You got to keep it healthy.

457
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:36,590
You got to be able to operate
in this world because in this,

458
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,820
in this dimension you're in,

459
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,331
you know,

460
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:39,260
people aren't to,

461
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:39,920
you know,

462
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,980
lay down for you just because you
have a higher spiritual truth.

463
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,530
Like you have to bring
both aspects to bear.

464
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:47,120
And I think that's what
we were supposed to do.

465
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,031
And I think every,

466
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:50,840
but almost everybody has
to whack on either side.

467
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,201
You know,

468
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:52,730
there's the big muscle
heads that are like,

469
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,391
oh yeah,

470
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:55,430
fuck that hippie bullshit crystals,

471
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:56,264
eighth dimension,

472
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,470
that fucking faggot.

473
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,250
And then there's this,

474
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:58,491
you know,

475
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:00,710
the other side of things that's like,

476
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,940
they have no sense of humor,

477
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:02,840
no sensor,

478
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,370
like almost academic in,

479
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,020
it's all energy.

480
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:06,860
It's all love.

481
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:07,461
It's all light.

482
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:09,650
And then someone fucking snatches
their purse and they're like,

483
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,760
oh my God,

484
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,420
there's something wrong with the,

485
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:12,860
you know,

486
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,300
like protect your shit.

487
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:14,811
You know,

488
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,490
like both sides are applicable.

489
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,970
And I think that's where people are
flawed and they're so vigilant about

490
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:21,470
protecting their little niche.

491
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:21,681
Like,

492
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:22,730
my shit is right.

493
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:23,980
I'll pound you if you drift,

494
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,660
you're wrong.

495
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,280
And if you believe something else
and the other people are like,

496
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,890
you're just an ignorant ape,

497
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,401
you know,

498
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,670
on the other side of things and no
one wants to kind of bridge that gap.

499
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,860
But our birthright is to have all of it.

500
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,580
And that's what we should strive for
is complete balance in both of those

501
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:38,001
aspects.

502
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:38,570
And I think,

503
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,890
I'm hoping that's why,

504
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,281
you know,

505
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:44,090
some people will listen to kind of
what I'm saying is because I tried it,

506
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,380
I tried to be able to do that.

507
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:48,500
Like I want to kick ass in business
and still talk to people about,

508
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,170
yeah dude,

509
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,980
like I went to another
dimension and it was crazy,

510
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,060
but I'm over here.

511
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,530
I'm going to be killing it,

512
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:54,920
you know,

513
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,820
in your world too.

514
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,410
So don't think I'm slipping,

515
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,240
you know?

516
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,660
That's what I'm trying to do.

517
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,520
And that's my goal.

518
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,440
A lot of people want to,

519
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,313
uh,

520
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:08,020
push aside or deny the
importance of the physical world,

521
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,980
the,

522
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,400
the,

523
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,870
whether it's capitalistic gains or
whether it's keeping your body fit and

524
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,010
sexually attractive.

525
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,940
They want to deny the significance
and importance of these things.

526
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:19,721
And the,

527
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:20,141
you know,

528
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:25,141
the meaning of these things almost as
like a form of socialism because they

529
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:30,820
don't want to compete and they don't
want to have to be sexually attractive.

530
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,110
And so women will say,

531
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,500
Oh,

532
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,550
is that what you care about?

533
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:33,701
Oh,

534
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:34,540
you're shallow.

535
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,680
You care about what someone looks like,

536
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,490
no,

537
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,750
I'm a human being.

538
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,770
I'm a human being.

539
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,700
And if you're fat,

540
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:40,534
that's gross.

541
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,111
Okay.

542
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:42,250
That's just the way it is.

543
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,930
And you can pretend all
you want and you know,

544
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:46,150
maybe you'll take fat
with a grace personality,

545
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,691
uh,

546
00:15:46,691 --> 00:15:47,650
over skinny.

547
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:48,484
That's a con.

548
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:48,851
Yeah.

549
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:50,560
Maybe to make some
compromises and you know,

550
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:51,730
no one's perfect physically,

551
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,450
but let's be honest about what we're
looking at and what you like and why you

552
00:15:55,451 --> 00:15:56,140
like it.

553
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,390
And that goes with capitalism as well.

554
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,150
That goes with being a successful person.

555
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:01,721
You know,

556
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:03,130
there's a lot of people
that think that some,

557
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:07,480
there's some things shallow about being
monetarily successful and I think that's

558
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,090
a form of socialistic thinking as well.

559
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:15,010
It's like you want this to be a level
playing field because you can't compete.

560
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,420
And that's really what it is,

561
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,021
you know?

562
00:16:17,021 --> 00:16:19,480
And you've got to find your
fucking place in the Sun Jack Ass.

563
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,350
And you know some people I will,

564
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:23,320
I will never be playing
professional basketball.

565
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:25,780
I'm five foot eight and I don't run
that good and it's just a fucking,

566
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,540
just the way of the world band
and they ain't a fair world.

567
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,230
Okay?

568
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,490
You got your own hand.

569
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,660
This is your journey.

570
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
You deal with the hand
that you're given and,

571
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:33,940
and,

572
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,920
and just find your fucking place.

573
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,950
But don't try to hold other people back.

574
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,190
Don't try to say there's something
wrong with that girl being sexy as fuck.

575
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,840
Don't think there's something wrong.

576
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,170
But because that guy's got a
six pack that makes girls wet,

577
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,640
you know when they see him,

578
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,110
you can't hate cause you're fat.

579
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,390
You can't hate your all.

580
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:51,651
But he's,

581
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:53,470
he shallow just going to the gym all day.

582
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,970
I'm sure he's really
interesting to talk to him.

583
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,050
Maybe he is.

584
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,400
Maybe he's more interesting than you.

585
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:58,600
Stupid because guess what?

586
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,430
It only takes like an
hour a day to work out.

587
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:02,830
You're telling me that all those other
hours of the day he has to be doing

588
00:17:02,831 --> 00:17:03,780
meaningless meathead.

589
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,190
Shit to make your paradigm work.

590
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:06,791
No,

591
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:07,391
you're just,

592
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:07,780
you're just,

593
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,390
you just want to pull
the playing field down.

594
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,990
You're not trying to level things now.

595
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:13,330
You're not trying to rise.

596
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,140
You're trying to,

597
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,250
everybody's above you,

598
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,420
your crabs in a bucket,

599
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:17,080
man.

600
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,750
Your social crabs in a bucket.

601
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,920
Yeah,

602
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,880
that's absolutely right.

603
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,470
Not a bitch is out there folks.

604
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,510
And most of them are men.

605
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,100
How about that?

606
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,700
Remember that when you hear whiny conti,

607
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:31,181
negative,

608
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:32,620
stupid shit from dudes,

609
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,390
you bitch,

610
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,970
saddle the fuck,

611
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:36,080
fuck

612
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,890
up.

613
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,340
Yeah.

614
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,000
It's uh,

615
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,331
you know,

616
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:40,560
I think back a long time ago,

617
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:43,130
and I think we've touched on
this maybe on the last podcast,

618
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:43,881
but you know,

619
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:46,520
you had to go to war and in
some countries you still do.

620
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:48,650
And I think that's why that
Israeli dude was so cool.

621
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,180
Like everybody in Israel
goes to war and he was like,

622
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:51,690
listen,

623
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,940
the kids are a little unruly or whatever.

624
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,630
But when you,

625
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,050
you know,

626
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,520
but the parents don't
care because they know,

627
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:58,410
you know what 19 you're going to war.

628
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,150
Like Israeli army is active.

629
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,073
It's very active.

630
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,830
It doesn't rest,

631
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,400
you know?

632
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,700
So that's one kind of last
people that's holding,

633
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:08,670
but still they're fighting with
lasers and a lot of things.

634
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:08,881
I mean,

635
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:09,451
not this guy,

636
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:10,284
he was running it,

637
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,330
fighting with shit that we
give them trippy situation.

638
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:16,270
Now there are about the size of Rhode
Island and they're surrounded by no hate

639
00:18:16,271 --> 00:18:16,630
them.

640
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,110
I know.

641
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,050
So countries all over the place to
hate them and some of them have nuclear

642
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:20,884
weapons.

643
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,280
Yeah.

644
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,410
But the fact that each one

645
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,450
one has to be a warrior at some point,

646
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:24,991
you know,

647
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:25,824
I think it,

648
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,610
it impacts,

649
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,361
there's more character.

650
00:18:27,361 --> 00:18:27,630
Yeah.

651
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,351
Impacts the culture.

652
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:30,240
And that's the way it used
to be back in the Roman days,

653
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:30,451
you know,

654
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:30,720
I mean,

655
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,560
every philosopher,

656
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:32,250
like I said,

657
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,750
Socrates was a bad ass.

658
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:34,020
You know,

659
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,340
every philosopher had to be,

660
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,960
they ran campaigns with swords and stab
barbarians in the throat and then talk

661
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:42,030
philosophy over some wine later.

662
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:42,864
And that's,

663
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,390
that aspect is largely ignored,

664
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:45,811
I think.

665
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:46,100
And,

666
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,933
and one of the,

667
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,450
one of the large,

668
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,230
uh,

669
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,450
sicknesses I think of
our world is they are,

670
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:51,930
like you said.

671
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,011
Yeah,

672
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:53,490
we definitely talked about this before,

673
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:55,380
the coming of age ceremony.

674
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:55,601
The,

675
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:55,980
this,

676
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,191
the,

677
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:58,110
the ritualistic aspect of,

678
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:58,351
you know,

679
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:02,550
making a big deal of coming of age
because I think that's something that's

680
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:03,630
missing from this world.

681
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,860
Cause I think that kids today,

682
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:06,300
like they don't know when they're a man,

683
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,021
you know,

684
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:07,560
one of your man,

685
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,730
you Manary 22,

686
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,913
23.

687
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,500
Yeah Man,

688
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,970
we dad still calls you a fuck head.

689
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:12,780
You need to borrow money.

690
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,613
He's still a man,

691
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:13,981
you know,

692
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:15,510
when do you become a man officially,

693
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:16,170
you know,

694
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,790
and then a lot of Eh,

695
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,300
you know,

696
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,990
cultures,

697
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,700
there's a ceremony,

698
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,241
you know,

699
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:21,841
like those,

700
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:22,051
uh,

701
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:25,080
the guys in the Amazon that
do that bullet ant glove.

702
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:25,921
Yeah,

703
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:27,030
we saw that tree by the way.

704
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,650
Fuck Outta here.

705
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,420
It's an ant that bite you,

706
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:34,171
it stings you.

707
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:39,171
And it feels like your arm is being
slammed in a car door for 24 hours

708
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,970
apparently is blinding,

709
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,620
unbearable pain.

710
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,690
And for the coming of age ceremony,

711
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:49,920
these crazy motherfuckers take these
ants and they give these oven mitts and

712
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:50,051
they,

713
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:50,231
they,

714
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,020
they make them themselves and these,

715
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:55,740
they're all poorest and they stuffed
the ants in there so the ants can't go

716
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:56,490
anywhere.

717
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,490
And you have to shove your hands into
these gloves filled with bullet ants and

718
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:03,030
mother fucker.

719
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:03,990
That looks scary.

720
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,210
That tears just streaming down these
men's faces as they were going through the

721
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:10,044
ceremony.

722
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,490
Will you get through that?

723
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:11,970
Man,

724
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,920
you have the right to
say you're a man now.

725
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,821
You know what I'm saying?

726
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:19,821
Like you feel like this is a very clear
boundary of broken through and you know,

727
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,230
I wouldn't suggest bullet ants.

728
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,213
Yeah,

729
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,680
well look at what happened to Ari,

730
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,851
you know,

731
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:30,181
as you,

732
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:30,671
and a little bit,

733
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:31,460
but think about it.

734
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,250
I,

735
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,410
I often think about it,

736
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,330
home of

737
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,080
politics,

738
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,291
you know,

739
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:35,740
like,

740
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,040
I feel like politicians should
have to fucking earn their place.

741
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,000
Like whether it's bullet answer,

742
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,850
like a five steps psychedelic,

743
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,251
you know,

744
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:44,350
trip where it's like,

745
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:44,680
all right,

746
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,040
you want wanna,

747
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,873
you want to lead us,

748
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,410
here's what you gotta do first.

749
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:50,800
You're going to go take a boga 24 hours
is going to cure you of your addictions

750
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,360
of bucking blowing coke off,

751
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:53,240
gay intern cock,

752
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,160
whatever you're into.

753
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:54,780
It'll,

754
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,031
you know,

755
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:55,864
at least the Copart,

756
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,010
maybe not the gay in turn.

757
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,570
I don't think it ever cure that,

758
00:20:58,571 --> 00:20:59,380
but uh,

759
00:20:59,380 --> 00:20:59,890
you know,

760
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,290
whatever it's going to whatever your,

761
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,560
you know,

762
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,180
addictions are cigarettes,

763
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,960
heroin,

764
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,291
coke,

765
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:05,800
whatever,

766
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,311
a Bogo,

767
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:07,300
blast that out of you.

768
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:08,260
24 hours.

769
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:08,741
All right,

770
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:09,580
so you go from there.

771
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,670
And then I think they should have to do
a fast for a week where they get smoked

772
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:16,810
out every day and have to control
their hunger and not eat and think.

773
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,921
And then after that,

774
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:20,140
like maybe go and do the Io Osca,

775
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,800
you know,

776
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,551
and then from there,

777
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:25,000
bring a bipartisan group to a
campfire where they all do mushrooms.

778
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:29,920
It just talk about ideas and shit and
then hit fucking session all drop a cap,

779
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,830
a pure pharmaceutical grade MDM,

780
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,020
boom.

781
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,580
Now you're just making these people party.

782
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,503
But listen,

783
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,060
I can get those good drugs,

784
00:21:39,061 --> 00:21:39,310
man.

785
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,030
Imagine how different it would be
if they had to do some kind of,

786
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,720
imagine how different it would be
if they had to go through bootcamp.

787
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,850
Just that go through some something
that shows your character other than the

788
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,280
photographs of your cock
that you send to your intern.

789
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,120
They busted him.

790
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,953
Another guy,

791
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,030
they busted another fucking politician
t sending pictures of his cock today.

792
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,540
Some fucking new guys resigning.

793
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,740
I don't even know who he was.

794
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,240
Just some dumb ass who thinks it's okay
to send pictures of his Dick through his

795
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,350
fucking cell phone.

796
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,110
Some chick who turns out to
be working for the enemy.

797
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,093
Wow.

798
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,180
Yeah,

799
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,110
he was kind of set up.

800
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,541
Yeah.

801
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:13,740
Yeah.

802
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,430
He was set up.

803
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,600
He's a fucking fool.

804
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,520
He looked like a fat 50 year olds.

805
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:19,290
Probably couldn't believe he
was going to get some pussy.

806
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,460
It's how I see your cock.

807
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:20,881
Okay,

808
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:25,110
here's my cock shit and next thing you
know these pictures around the net and he

809
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:30,090
looks like a fucking idiot and now
he's got to resign and God damn man,

810
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,950
they're allowed to do that though.

811
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:32,731
Just because they're,

812
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:33,930
they have their job.

813
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,520
They're not allowed to do
that on their off time.

814
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,250
There's still men

815
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,390
because they pretending they're someone
else because they pretend to be family.

816
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:45,391
Men with great Christian values and
loyal to their wive and their vows.

817
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,301
But meanwhile,

818
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:48,610
they're sending cock pictures
all over the fucking Internet.

819
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,610
And so you know that this is
a person who's full of Shit.

820
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,890
And this is a person who can't be trusted.

821
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:57,700
His character can't be trusted because
he's pretending to be something he's not.

822
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,000
It's not like Tommy Lee sending
pictures of his Dick and you're like,

823
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,451
oh,

824
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:02,284
Tommy,

825
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,100
you know,

826
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,060
it's fucking Tommy Lee.

827
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:04,960
He's crazy.

828
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:06,550
He's married to Pamela Anderson.

829
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,660
We've all seen his dick.

830
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,673
You know what I'm saying?

831
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,220
It's like if Tommy Lee was sending
pictures of his Dick to girls,

832
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:11,651
he'd be like,

833
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:12,100
well,

834
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,070
my Dick look like that.

835
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:13,380
I missed that.

836
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,260
It fixes of it though.

837
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,640
You know,

838
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,750
it's not like that.

839
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:18,820
When someone pretends to
be something they're not,

840
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:19,840
and we know they're not,

841
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:20,800
we know that there.

842
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,940
There's no way.

843
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,670
Most politicians can
really be the way they are.

844
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,240
You remember how John Edwards used to
pretend he was until we found out he was

845
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:32,350
banging some other chick while his
wife was dying of cancer and apparently

846
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:34,870
fucking physically
threatened her and you know,

847
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,010
yeah,

848
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,630
he's a fucking use campaign funds to
hide the fact that he was banging this

849
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:41,260
broad.

850
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,090
So now he's probably going to go to jail.

851
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:43,470
This is there.

852
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,040
It's fucking going after John Edwards.

853
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,430
But at one point in time,

854
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:51,431
John Edwards was this lawyer with good
old fashion American values and pull them

855
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:53,480
up by your bootstraps,

856
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,050
you know,

857
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,060
work ethic and you know,

858
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,230
you,

859
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,421
you,

860
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:56,641
you,

861
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:56,821
you,

862
00:23:56,821 --> 00:24:01,790
you'd come to find out that it is
impossible to be a pure person,

863
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,970
to be the guy that
you're pretending to be,

864
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:06,410
to be a politician.

865
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,450
They push it back so far that
eventually it pops out somewhere.

866
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,860
It blows out there dressing up like a
tiger and taking pictures or Al Gore

867
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,860
fucking tries to get his dick sucked
while he's getting a massage and the chick

868
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:19,630
wants a sec,

869
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:19,910
you know,

870
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,440
charge them with sexual assault.

871
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,461
You know,

872
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,240
there's some truth.

873
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,020
There's something,

874
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,130
something happened there.

875
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:25,731
You know,

876
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:26,660
something happened there.

877
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,860
I don't know what it was.

878
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,110
She might have overblown it.

879
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,180
He might've just rubbed his cock
honor just as like a little tester.

880
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,570
Who knows what the fuck happened.

881
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,800
But whatever happened,

882
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,630
it's not what we thought Al Gore was.

883
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,960
We didn't think Al Gore was whipping his
dick out and fucking hotels was getting

884
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:42,794
massaged.

885
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,790
We didn't think that was,

886
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,590
he was pulling girls on top of them.

887
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,970
We didn't think that was Al Gore.

888
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:47,900
I don't know if he did that,

889
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,830
but he did enough or got into a situation
that was enough for him to get in

890
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:52,664
trouble.

891
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,160
You know?

892
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:53,391
I mean,

893
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:57,700
no one talks about what Winston
Churchill did with his women like that.

894
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,311
That was like,

895
00:24:58,311 --> 00:24:59,360
it didn't fucking matter.

896
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,530
Fighting the Nazis.

897
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:01,460
He was kicking ass.

898
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,020
And I think all our politicians now,

899
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:04,010
they're so fraudulent.

900
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:07,160
And what their kind of projecting
that it does matter at this point.

901
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:10,070
It's like you're a hypocritical
lying little bastard.

902
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,050
But if they were real,

903
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:16,010
like really doing shit and very honest
with what they're attacking and the

904
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,220
issues they were attacking were honest
and they were coming from a real place.

905
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,120
It's like,

906
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,661
oh yeah,

907
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:23,030
our fucking fearless leader after a big,

908
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:23,660
you know,

909
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,351
a tough night.

910
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:25,000
He had some,

911
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,640
you know,

912
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,720
sexual indiscretion,

913
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:27,350
whatever,

914
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,370
you forgive that stuff.

915
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:31,070
But when they build
this foundation full of,

916
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,060
you know,

917
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,010
puritanical nonsense,

918
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,850
then they do that.

919
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,560
They feel like that's the only
way to get elected though.

920
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,860
And there's so much power in bullshit
today with the idea of the Christian

921
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:43,070
ideology and the,

922
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:43,311
you know,

923
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:43,851
the Christian,

924
00:25:43,851 --> 00:25:44,210
right.

925
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,560
And the fucking,

926
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,160
you know,

927
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,090
so Uber judgmental and that,

928
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,993
that there's,

929
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,230
that's a big political push because
those people were organized.

930
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:54,860
Those,

931
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,320
those,

932
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,320
the really right wing
Christian fundamentalists that,

933
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,304
that movement,

934
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,990
that's a very organized movement.

935
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,370
And if they're on your side,

936
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:05,690
you can do a lot of damage.

937
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,950
And if they're against you,

938
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:07,910
it can really hurt.

939
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,540
You know,

940
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,750
if they do organize the churches and
they all said pull out and they say,

941
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:11,901
well,

942
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:12,321
this is fucking,

943
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,970
Al Gore doesn't believe in Jesus.

944
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,110
Oh fuck him.

945
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,651
You know,

946
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:16,470
they'll go crazy.

947
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,280
You have to fake that
you believe in Jesus,

948
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,750
whether you do or not,

949
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:23,160
you better say you do because you're,

950
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:24,290
if you say you don't,

951
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,870
you're going to piss off 50 fucking
percent of the country and you're never

952
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:27,920
gonna get anything done.

953
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,710
Yeah,

954
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,480
yeah.

955
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,291
Fuck situation.

956
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,310
And I think that's why,

957
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,410
you know,

958
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,770
there's the shamans down there when they
talk about 2012 they talk about it just

959
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:37,610
as a tipping point.

960
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,321
But that,

961
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:38,810
that's like,

962
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,111
that's,

963
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:39,944
they talked about it.

964
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,590
Yeah.

965
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,040
Well they said that 2012
is the tipping point.

966
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,980
That's when the

967
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,170
world has to start changing and it will,

968
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:46,621
uh,

969
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:47,940
upheavals will happen.

970
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,800
They don't know if it's
going to be economic.

971
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:51,090
They don't know if it's going to be,

972
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,511
you know,

973
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:51,901
physical,

974
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,760
it's not the end of time
or anything like that.

975
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:54,480
And that was,

976
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,210
it was kind of cool to
hear them talk about it.

977
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,480
So like that's all nonsense.

978
00:26:57,481 --> 00:26:58,314
It's all hype.

979
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,260
What it is is it's the point at which
things must start changing for us.

980
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,660
Why is there a date?

981
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,100
Why is it,

982
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,740
do I think it's December 21st,

983
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,120
2012 or was it 2012 at all?

984
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,450
It's to a astrological restaurant.

985
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:13,830
Comical kind of event,

986
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:14,160
right?

987
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,150
Isn't there some kind of

988
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,490
the alignment I've heard,

989
00:27:16,491 --> 00:27:16,790
I didn't,

990
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,960
obviously I'm not an astronomer,

991
00:27:17,961 --> 00:27:21,680
but I've heard Neil Tyson talk
about how that's bullshit into that.

992
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,100
That event happens all the
time that everyone's talking
about how it aligns with

993
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,130
the center of the galaxy and he's like
can always does to happens all the time.

994
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,420
Yeah.

995
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,601
Well,

996
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:29,231
so I don't know.

997
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,910
I don't exactly know
how they got the date.

998
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,050
I mean I think it was tied
to some kind of of going on

999
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,680
in this,

1000
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,041
in the,

1001
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,530
in the idea of astrology and astronomy,

1002
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,930
there's so much going on where you know,

1003
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:45,250
they can figure out that the moon is off
a little bit with its gravity and then

1004
00:27:45,251 --> 00:27:48,820
they have to figure out what is
responsible for this error and the moon's

1005
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:49,651
gravity will,

1006
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:53,440
it could be a brown dwarf star that lays,

1007
00:27:53,441 --> 00:27:53,681
you know,

1008
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:55,870
a hundred million miles outside of Pluto.

1009
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,950
And that's like the
current theory is in it.

1010
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,350
But they can figure that out.

1011
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,191
They can figure it out.

1012
00:28:00,191 --> 00:28:04,450
They couldn't measure gravity and know
that there's errors in places and try to

1013
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:07,150
like figure out what y where's
this error coming from.

1014
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,420
So we know that that for sure that the
moon's effect and its particular gravity

1015
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:14,230
has an effect on tides.

1016
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,110
We believe it has an
effect on human behavior,

1017
00:28:17,111 --> 00:28:18,490
although that's all subjective.

1018
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:19,580
But we,

1019
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,480
we know that these little bodies or these,

1020
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:22,721
these,

1021
00:28:22,721 --> 00:28:23,830
these motions and these,

1022
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:28,390
these things that we can't quite grab a
hold of have a very physical effect on

1023
00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:28,720
the earth.

1024
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,770
Like in the tide w who knows how many
different things are doing that all the

1025
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:34,690
time with the procession of the equinoxes,

1026
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,540
the fact that the earth
wobbles on its access,

1027
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:37,860
uh,

1028
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,850
26,000 year cycle.

1029
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,350
And in between that times,

1030
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:41,711
you know,

1031
00:28:41,711 --> 00:28:44,050
you never know what is aligned with what,

1032
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:48,640
when you were brought into this world
and that the idea behind astrology as

1033
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:51,940
fucking flaky and new agey
and bullshitty as it sounds,

1034
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,770
is that these events,

1035
00:28:53,771 --> 00:28:56,860
these alignments of
stars and positions of,

1036
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,750
of the moon and all
these different things,

1037
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:03,930
they actually affect how a human being
is charged as they're set loose from the

1038
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:05,650
vagina into the world.

1039
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,041
You know,

1040
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:06,400
that it,

1041
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,260
that it actually has on it and it look,

1042
00:29:08,261 --> 00:29:08,980
it fucking,

1043
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,030
I know a lot of Leos,

1044
00:29:10,031 --> 00:29:11,200
it seemed like Leo's,

1045
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,070
you know,

1046
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,010
I know a lot of cancers
that act like cancer.

1047
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:14,883
I mean,

1048
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,760
fuck it sounds like utter horse shit,

1049
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:20,740
but God damn it's fucking clothes.

1050
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,603
It seems,

1051
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,990
it seems damn close.

1052
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,923
Yeah.

1053
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,471
So yeah,

1054
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:24,741
I mean,

1055
00:29:24,741 --> 00:29:26,060
I don't know exactly what the,

1056
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:26,480
uh,

1057
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,700
what the event is that
they named the date for.

1058
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:29,511
They didn't go into that.

1059
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:32,750
But what they said is that a new type of
person has to emerge at that point and

1060
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:36,560
that the old ways have to change and
they will and that things will get fucked

1061
00:29:36,561 --> 00:29:37,760
up enough where they have to.

1062
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,331
It's like,

1063
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:41,030
it's not like we all got a rally and you,

1064
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,771
but we do.

1065
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:43,060
And when we do it to a certain degree,

1066
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:43,930
we have to prepare for it,

1067
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:44,800
but it'll,

1068
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:46,270
it'll force itself to happen.

1069
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:48,880
So we just need to be ready
for it as what they're saying.

1070
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:52,450
Like the new era is going to come and
it's going to happen either complete

1071
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:53,710
economic upheaval,

1072
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,360
physical upheaval of the earth.

1073
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:55,781
Um,

1074
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:58,030
whatever's going to happen
is going to force our hand.

1075
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,950
And then the new people are
going to have to emerge.

1076
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:02,290
They call it the legend
of Catsa Quadel defense,

1077
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,191
the feathered serpent.

1078
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:07,480
But really that represents the new type
of human that comes and starts taking a

1079
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:08,201
leadership role.

1080
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:12,100
So all of these cock picturing
politicians and everything,

1081
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,670
whatever they believe is going to happen
is going to change that paradigm where

1082
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:20,110
all of a sudden that becomes deemphasized
either faith in them gets lost,

1083
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:21,670
a new system as to emerge.

1084
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,690
New leaders,

1085
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,490
new,

1086
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:23,750
you know,

1087
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,560
political.

1088
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:24,930
Is this,

1089
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,670
the Shamans have actually
explained this to you?

1090
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,240
Yeah.

1091
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,410
Did they talk about the Internet?

1092
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,573
Are they on Twitter?

1093
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,393
How come on,

1094
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,823
you can tell,

1095
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,630
you can tell the mountain the mountain
shamans are dim at different than the

1096
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:38,261
jungle shamans.

1097
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:42,100
But you can tell a good mountain Sharman
by how much he smells like burnt Lama

1098
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,380
Shit because that's how they
stay warm up in the high parts.

1099
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:46,360
So it'd be really be really,

1100
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:46,610
look,

1101
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,430
it really smells like burnt Lama Shit.

1102
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:48,671
You know,

1103
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:52,310
he's probably authentic cause then he's
up up above 15,000 feet for most of

1104
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:52,630
them.

1105
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,411
Jesus Christ,

1106
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:54,700
but no cell phone,

1107
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,720
no Internet.

1108
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:58,030
And he's missing the cool youtube videos.

1109
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,490
Some one of them,

1110
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,570
one of the guys that had,

1111
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,110
uh,

1112
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,160
I was talking with,

1113
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:02,871
had a,

1114
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:05,990
at a full URL at the bottom
of his little corner.

1115
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,410
So they're starting to adapt to it.

1116
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,460
Nice seeing you.

1117
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,181
They need that.

1118
00:31:09,181 --> 00:31:09,600
There's,

1119
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:09,931
you know,

1120
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:12,120
people poo poo the cultural experience,

1121
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:12,391
you know,

1122
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:14,880
because it's filled with
morons and lady Gaga fans.

1123
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,620
But there's nothing wrong with lady Gaga.

1124
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,011
Okay.

1125
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:19,470
That's part of the trip and
I think she's fascinating.

1126
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:20,700
I like some of her music.

1127
00:31:20,701 --> 00:31:21,570
How about that?

1128
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,570
And there's nothing wrong with the
rest of the cultural experiments.

1129
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:26,430
Even the most ridiculous aspects of it.

1130
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,930
It's all part of us,

1131
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:28,561
you know?

1132
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:30,300
And you don't want to be locked out.

1133
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,840
I don't buy that being locked out
when I talked to someone and go,

1134
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:33,690
I don't know if you have an email,

1135
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,890
well you're a fucking moron.

1136
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,640
How about that?

1137
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,930
You don't want an email.

1138
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,350
You don't want people to be able to
send you cool shit that you can read.

1139
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,460
You didn't want photos.

1140
00:31:41,461 --> 00:31:42,600
That'll blow your mind.

1141
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,170
You don't want someone turning you on to
some fucking article that might change

1142
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:46,830
your life.

1143
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,610
You don't want that.

1144
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,270
You don't want that.

1145
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:48,690
Okay,

1146
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,860
you're cool too cool for that.

1147
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,440
What are you going to do?

1148
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,121
Sniff flowers.

1149
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:51,960
You fucking Weirdo

1150
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:52,901
for them.

1151
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:53,470
It's like,

1152
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:53,890
I mean,

1153
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,221
really,

1154
00:31:54,221 --> 00:31:57,250
do they want to just affect only
the few people in the village?

1155
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:58,420
If you're a real shot and be like,

1156
00:31:58,421 --> 00:31:58,661
yeah,

1157
00:31:58,661 --> 00:31:59,051
fuck yeah,

1158
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,260
I want to get my word out there.

1159
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,300
I want to make change.

1160
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:02,290
I want to make things happen.

1161
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,010
And I think it goes back to kind of what
Pressfield says about professionals,

1162
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,150
like the professional,

1163
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,860
the shamans down there were professionals.

1164
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,300
They're not trying to be shamans.

1165
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,610
They just fucking are.

1166
00:32:11,611 --> 00:32:12,431
That's their job.

1167
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,264
That's what they do.

1168
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,410
And they're professionals at it.

1169
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:14,801
So yeah,

1170
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:15,880
the Internet comes along,

1171
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,470
they analyze that tool and they're like,

1172
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:17,801
oh yeah,

1173
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:18,550
that's cool.

1174
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:18,761
You know?

1175
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:21,160
Or if something funny happens
in the middle of their ceremony,

1176
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,083
they're not like,

1177
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,140
I better not laugh.

1178
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,970
Or people might think
that I'm not a showman.

1179
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:25,481
You know?

1180
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:26,110
They're like,

1181
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,030
they'll fucking crack up and be like,

1182
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,210
ah.

1183
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,130
And then they'll just get back
to their work when they're done.

1184
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,810
They don't take themselves so seriously
that it's like anything could shake the

1185
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:35,441
experience.

1186
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:36,460
It's not for other people.

1187
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,650
They're going to do their work and
whatever happens when they do their work,

1188
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:40,280
that's fine.

1189
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,040
They go with it.

1190
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,960
And that was something I really appreciate
it because even when you get out here

1191
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:47,540
in this kind of slightly
pseudo spiritual thing,

1192
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:49,040
it's like they're putting on an act,

1193
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,581
you know,

1194
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:51,500
like the music has to be perfect and

1195
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,480
the candles have to grow with the
right and the crystal has to be without

1196
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:57,380
impurities,

1197
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:57,950
you know?

1198
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,700
And they're like,

1199
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,241
okay,

1200
00:32:59,241 --> 00:32:59,421
you know,

1201
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:00,310
if they use rocks,

1202
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,010
they're like,

1203
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,030
this is a good rock,

1204
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:02,301
you know,

1205
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:04,370
and it just looks like a fucking rock

1206
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,670
spiritual bullshit.

1207
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:07,560
Spiritual talk is the grossest shit.

1208
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,280
Yeah.

1209
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,750
I got married by a hack.

1210
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,200
We got some lady off the
Internet that married.

1211
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:12,540
I said,

1212
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:12,811
oh,

1213
00:33:12,811 --> 00:33:13,890
it was brutal.

1214
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:19,190
Your love is two streams that will
become together a growing river.

1215
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,800
It will wash over the rocks of the world.

1216
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:22,980
Like,

1217
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,191
oh,

1218
00:33:23,191 --> 00:33:24,360
you crazy bitch.

1219
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,730
There was no feeling to it at all.

1220
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,050
Like as she was saying it,

1221
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:30,180
there was no connection to the words.

1222
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,420
It was just utter spiritual
nonsense because it was a
nondenominational wedding,

1223
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,301
obviously,

1224
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:37,710
because I'm not religious.

1225
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:38,790
Nora's Mrs Rogan.

1226
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:44,210
So it had a listen to this nonsense
crystal sucking fucking ideas.

1227
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,050
Marriott world of Narnia.

1228
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,273
Yeah.

1229
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,050
This bitch lived at totally in Narnia.

1230
00:33:49,051 --> 00:33:50,220
She had a hut in Narnia.

1231
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,950
It was brutal.

1232
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,551
This,

1233
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:54,090
um,

1234
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,280
I found the article about
the Colombian showman.

1235
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,850
He was arrested in Texas and
charged with IOWASCA possession.

1236
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,250
He flew into the Houston airport.

1237
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,230
And the crazy thing about being charged
with Iowasca possession is the plants

1238
00:34:07,231 --> 00:34:10,050
that you use to create
Iowasca or not even illegal.

1239
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,410
That's the weirdest aspect of it.

1240
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,130
You know,

1241
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,700
I met the guy from
bouncing bear botanicals.

1242
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,200
He came to my show in Vegas.

1243
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,363
Yeah.

1244
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:20,880
Uh,

1245
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,020
if you don't know the story,

1246
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:25,710
there was a guy who ran a website called
bouncing bear botanicals and it's a

1247
00:34:25,711 --> 00:34:30,711
website all dedicated to selling legal
plants that have psychedelic properties

1248
00:34:30,961 --> 00:34:31,500
to them.

1249
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,220
Like the San Pedro Cactus that you
could buy at fucking home depot.

1250
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:35,851
Yeah.

1251
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:37,860
Well you can make
Mescalin out of that shit.

1252
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:38,461
You can,

1253
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:39,630
you can open that bitch up,

1254
00:34:39,631 --> 00:34:42,750
make some Payoti if you know what
you're doing and trip your balls off.

1255
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,470
This is off some shit that you just buy
at home depot and it's totally legal.

1256
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,230
It's a beautiful cactus and a lot
of people don't even know about the

1257
00:34:49,231 --> 00:34:50,520
psychedelic properties of it.

1258
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,980
They have it just to decorate
their garden because it's pretty,

1259
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,710
but it's not illegal.

1260
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,970
So they,

1261
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,661
they,

1262
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:58,740
he has this there,

1263
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,491
he's selling this,

1264
00:34:59,491 --> 00:35:04,050
he's selling the different circuitry had
Veritas and the different plants that

1265
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:06,570
you mix to make Iowasca
he's selling those.

1266
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:07,391
He's selling Salvia.

1267
00:35:07,391 --> 00:35:11,790
I sang all these different plants that
are absolutely legal morning glory seeds.

1268
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,730
You know a lot of people
don't know that morning glory,

1269
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:15,091
seeds,

1270
00:35:15,091 --> 00:35:19,080
just those regular fucking seeds that
you buy when you go to plant to make

1271
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:19,800
flowers.

1272
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,060
Well the ones that you buy,

1273
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:21,894
most of them,

1274
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:26,990
they've been treated so that they are
not psychoactive because regular morning

1275
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:27,870
glory seeds,

1276
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:32,670
you can grind those bitches up and eat
them and you'll trip your fucking balls

1277
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:33,300
off.

1278
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,410
Hell yeah.

1279
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,560
So untreated,

1280
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,430
they're still your,

1281
00:35:36,431 --> 00:35:37,170
their legal,

1282
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,160
you can buy the untreated

1283
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,970
ones.

1284
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,050
It's hard to get,

1285
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,370
it's hard to get the untreated ones.

1286
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:44,160
You're supposed to treat them because the
government is aware of the psychedelic

1287
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:44,994
properties of them.

1288
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,470
Meanwhile,

1289
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:45,701
you know,

1290
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:49,370
of course it's not nearly as dangerous
as cigarettes or alcohol or any of the

1291
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,340
things they sanction,

1292
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,660
but it's to mind bending for the
government allowed the unwashed masses to

1293
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:55,411
participate in.

1294
00:35:55,411 --> 00:35:59,790
So your wise daddy government is figured
out how to neuter this incredibly

1295
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:03,240
brilliant psychedelic plant to the point
where most people aren't even aware of

1296
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:04,074
its properties.

1297
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,250
But regular morning glory seeds was
Terence Mckenna's first psychedelic trip.

1298
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,860
That's what sent him on his
fucking wacky journey of,

1299
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:11,210
you know,

1300
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,530
being psychedelic Shawman of the,

1301
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,580
the new world.

1302
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,270
Um,

1303
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,680
and that was a,

1304
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,011
you know,

1305
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:20,970
a common thing that people did in the
70s and the 60s before the government got

1306
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:21,720
hip to it.

1307
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,720
They were just tripping balls
and morning glory seeds,

1308
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:25,620
you know.

1309
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,291
So this guy,

1310
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:30,030
this John or he says that was saying
from bouncing bear botanicals.

1311
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,391
Anyway,

1312
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:31,800
there's two dudes that I met that came,

1313
00:36:31,801 --> 00:36:34,200
they were high as fuck there was so high,

1314
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:35,670
I can barely talk to them after the show.

1315
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,540
They came to my last Vegas show and I
talked to them outside and that swarm of

1316
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:39,871
people,

1317
00:36:39,871 --> 00:36:42,810
remember there's all two of
those of those crazy guys.

1318
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,610
They were trying to have like
a serious conversation with me.

1319
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:44,790
Me,

1320
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:48,840
it was like 500 people trying to take
pictures and they want to hold on in my

1321
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:49,451
hand and talk to him.

1322
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:49,650
I'm like,

1323
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:49,750
dude,

1324
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,583
wasn't a lot of people here.

1325
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,260
I can't remember to talk
to you about your arrest.

1326
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,940
Glad you're doing the right thing.

1327
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:54,774
Glad you got out.

1328
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,130
But apparently they let him out of jail.

1329
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,930
They had to let him
out eventually because,

1330
00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:58,080
uh,

1331
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,500
there's,

1332
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:58,801
you know,

1333
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:00,860
there's nothing he can
fucking charge him for there.

1334
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,110
There's nothing that said that
he was making drugs trashed.

1335
00:37:04,111 --> 00:37:05,250
His place crashes,

1336
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,840
confiscated all the state.

1337
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:07,950
I don't know if he got his money back,

1338
00:37:07,951 --> 00:37:10,170
but they froze all that
as well for nothing,

1339
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,430
for nothing.

1340
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,070
Because the government is
scared of psychedelics.

1341
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:15,960
It's amazing how scared they are of it.

1342
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,020
And I guarantee you they're scared of
it because they're not experiencing it.

1343
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,040
It's that simple.

1344
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,770
Like when you get into like
Alex Jones believes crazy shit.

1345
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:25,140
Like he believes that the
elites were all smoking DMT.

1346
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,470
Like they're all up in,

1347
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:26,761
you know,

1348
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:27,720
Hilton Talk to you about,

1349
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:29,970
they're all in fucking and
shit where Guantanamo Bay,

1350
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,990
they're all down in Guantanamo
Bay and they are smoking DMT,

1351
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,460
connecting to the spirit world.

1352
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,980
They believe in eternal life
what they're going to do.

1353
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,610
And he'll tell you all this nonsense that
he absolutely positively believes in,

1354
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:46,770
but I believe 100% you cannot smoke
DMT and not be empathetic towards other

1355
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:47,700
people that are doing it.

1356
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,560
You cannot take Iowa school or mushrooms
without being empathetic and wanting

1357
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,281
other people to do it.

1358
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:55,650
These people that are trying
to keep everybody from it,

1359
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,740
those are the people sending their dicks
to their fucking secretaries and their

1360
00:37:58,741 --> 00:37:59,430
emails.

1361
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,600
Those are the fucking hypocrite,

1362
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,820
hypocritical shitheads with huge flaws
and their character that we have running

1363
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:07,560
this country and running this world.

1364
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,930
And unfortunately that's,

1365
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,190
that's one of our biggest issues
are what we considered leaders.

1366
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,660
We know for sure that it's a
bullshit scam and we allow it.

1367
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:19,050
We have,

1368
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,760
we have resigned ourselves.

1369
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,340
We know that the president
has speech writers.

1370
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,570
We know that everyone has a bunch of
people that will review every word that

1371
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,810
he's going to say and it's going to be
calculated and they're going to sit down

1372
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,110
and come up with the,

1373
00:38:32,111 --> 00:38:37,111
the the right words and enact the most
emotional impact to the point where they

1374
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:38,410
even fucking,

1375
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,710
they used to plagiarize other people's
speeches before they got busted for it.

1376
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,610
Joe Biden,

1377
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,160
our own fucking vice
president used to plagiarize.

1378
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:46,930
He blew plagiarized Kennedy Shit.

1379
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:47,261
Well,

1380
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:50,170
they caught them doing that in 1,988
that's why he had to quit running for

1381
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:51,004
president,

1382
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,641
you know,

1383
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:54,370
and that's why he had to like sit in
the background and wait for everybody to

1384
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:56,530
kind of forget about it before
he could be vice president.

1385
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,191
You know,

1386
00:38:57,191 --> 00:38:58,840
we know for a fact that it's,

1387
00:38:58,841 --> 00:38:59,201
it's a,

1388
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,400
it's a bullshit hustle.

1389
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,350
We're all aware of lobbyists.

1390
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:07,330
We're all aware of special interest groups
and corporations donating millions of

1391
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:07,420
dollars.

1392
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,260
We're all aware that the supreme court
changed the ruling so that a corporation

1393
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:12,880
can now act as an individual.

1394
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,280
So they can donate as much
fucking money as they want,

1395
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,720
which is absurd.

1396
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,930
The idea that a corporation that
would rely on politicians and their,

1397
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:20,231
their,

1398
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:23,950
their decisions to make money in a
way that may or may not be ethical,

1399
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:29,130
but they'll rely on and then they just
donated x amount of fucking millions of

1400
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,280
dollars towards this person.

1401
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,090
It's insane.

1402
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:31,923
It's amazing.

1403
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,290
And we accept it for now because
things are relatively placid,

1404
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:35,620
you know?

1405
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:35,891
Yeah.

1406
00:39:35,891 --> 00:39:37,900
We have some little few
financial difficulties,

1407
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:39,220
but whatever people's lives,

1408
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,630
they go on and we go and you know what
they're saying about 2012 is had at

1409
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,150
certain point things aren't going
to be fucking plastic anymore.

1410
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:48,430
And at that point we're not
going to accept that bullshit.

1411
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:52,660
We're not going to expect except these
weak ass politicians who don't really

1412
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:54,640
stand for anything to lead us anymore.

1413
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:55,660
So what's going to happen?

1414
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,591
Who the fuck knows?

1415
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:56,951
They don't know.

1416
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:57,641
They don't have the answer,

1417
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:00,790
but they're going to say some type of
new person is going to have to emerge and

1418
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:01,330
be like,

1419
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:01,960
Yo,

1420
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,920
this is bullshit.

1421
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,170
Like we needed to make some changes now.

1422
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:06,520
Like things are getting fucked up,

1423
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,020
even worse and worse.

1424
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,970
Have you seen the,

1425
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:09,270
the,

1426
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,320
the numbers that they did when they were,

1427
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:12,730
they did an audit of the,

1428
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:12,851
uh,

1429
00:40:12,851 --> 00:40:16,600
the Fed to find out where the fucking
money went for the bailout and they found

1430
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:21,601
trillions of dollars that went to
these weird fucking overseas banks.

1431
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:27,030
And it's totally beyond description how
much corruption and ridiculous bullshit

1432
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:32,860
is involved and how little accountability
there is for this distribution of,

1433
00:40:32,861 --> 00:40:34,120
of the taxpayers wealth.

1434
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:34,691
I mean,

1435
00:40:34,691 --> 00:40:36,730
it's a fucking free for all,

1436
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:37,390
man.

1437
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,770
It's craziness.

1438
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,400
So it's to say that there's
a few financial difficulties.

1439
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:47,350
The whole thing is built on
this foundation of unfixable
bullshit and there's no

1440
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:48,400
solution in sight.

1441
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,323
Yeah,

1442
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,350
that's worse.

1443
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:50,590
I mean,

1444
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,080
that is getting more credit
rating about to be downgraded.

1445
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,010
China already did.

1446
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,350
They downgraded our credit rating
even though we didn't default,

1447
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,890
even though we raised our,

1448
00:40:57,891 --> 00:40:58,210
our,

1449
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,260
our debt ceiling,

1450
00:40:59,261 --> 00:40:59,561
they're like,

1451
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:01,210
these bitches are like on the edge.

1452
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,090
You know,

1453
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,940
it's like when you try
to get too many loans,

1454
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:05,200
even if you pay your loans back,

1455
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,430
the banks are going,

1456
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:07,810
why are you asking for all this money?

1457
00:41:07,811 --> 00:41:08,081
Dude,

1458
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:08,380
what are you,

1459
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,310
what's going on with you?

1460
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,960
But you've got a gambling problem.

1461
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,400
But yeah,

1462
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:12,671
it's,

1463
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:13,030
it's,

1464
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,290
it's,

1465
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:13,960
it's not,

1466
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,870
it's not fucking getting
fixed in the system.

1467
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,590
And this,

1468
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:17,860
the,

1469
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,051
the,

1470
00:41:18,051 --> 00:41:18,261
the,

1471
00:41:18,261 --> 00:41:20,830
the way it's set up right now and
the model that we're operating under,

1472
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:23,050
it's not getting fixed
and everyone's frustrated.

1473
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:24,280
No one knows that knows what to do.

1474
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,380
And me like you,

1475
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,690
like I'm the fucking
completely full of Shit.

1476
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:30,700
All I do is just complain about it.

1477
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,310
And then I go about my day and as long
as I have food in the refrigerator and I

1478
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:37,070
have the ability to use
my credit card to buy gas,

1479
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,170
I'm only gonna Yap too much.

1480
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:39,920
You know,

1481
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,750
it almost like it has to fall apart on
all of us before we step back and we go,

1482
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:45,111
all right,

1483
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:45,351
all right,

1484
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:46,460
well now we have to admit

1485
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,540
doesn't work right?

1486
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,860
Well what you're doing,

1487
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:50,690
but you're doing something
more important than that,

1488
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:51,381
I think as well,

1489
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:54,020
is that you're creating a
movement of consciousness.

1490
00:41:54,021 --> 00:41:56,480
I mean every time new
people turn it tune in,

1491
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,460
you know you have their
ear and these people,

1492
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,300
but I have no activated of no,

1493
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,540
there's no crisis yet necessarily.

1494
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:02,901
Right.

1495
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:04,580
It's sort of where is though.

1496
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,430
No,

1497
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:05,871
kind of.

1498
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:09,590
Probably if we had the foresight to
really look ahead and start doing things

1499
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:09,831
now,

1500
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:14,420
but it's not pressured enough like it's
not beating down our door so it's just

1501
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:15,560
really not going to happen.

1502
00:42:15,561 --> 00:42:16,281
Realistically,

1503
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:18,470
we probably not that we shouldn't
try and do it or whatever.

1504
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:19,041
I'm not saying that,

1505
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,450
but so much work though.

1506
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,141
That's the problem.

1507
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:23,990
If you want to live your life at
some point when things get fucked,

1508
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:25,370
you know you may have,

1509
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,280
this is the Joe Rogan
fucking emergency podcasts.

1510
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:28,940
Listen,

1511
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,680
like this is what needs to happen.

1512
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,270
Like seriously and you'll have,

1513
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,590
you'll have that power like fucking
John Connor for your own small people of

1514
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:40,460
conscious fucking humans who are going
to be able to then go out and like,

1515
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,150
all right,

1516
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,890
everything we're being fed is nonsense.

1517
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:43,470
Don't use it.

1518
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,510
The shit goes down.

1519
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,960
The Internet is going to be
the first thing they shut off.

1520
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,230
They tried to do that in another country.

1521
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:50,460
So they have,

1522
00:42:50,461 --> 00:42:51,090
they've done it.

1523
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:51,510
But yeah,

1524
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,630
there were did in Libya
when they do it in Egypt,

1525
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:55,681
Egypt.

1526
00:42:55,681 --> 00:42:56,760
But there was still ways around it.

1527
00:42:56,761 --> 00:42:57,860
People were still getting mad.

1528
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,270
He's going to intentionally fuck us.

1529
00:43:00,271 --> 00:43:03,540
I just think they're going to be
incapable of helping us at that point.

1530
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:03,961
You know,

1531
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:05,040
like that's my personal belief.

1532
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:05,820
I don't think I'd be like,

1533
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,030
shut the internet down.

1534
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,870
It's just gonna be like,

1535
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:08,430
ah,

1536
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,031
what do we do?

1537
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:09,601
We're a bunch of,

1538
00:43:09,601 --> 00:43:09,811
you know,

1539
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:12,390
we've never fucking stuck our
hand in a glove full of ants.

1540
00:43:12,391 --> 00:43:13,530
We are not ready for this shit

1541
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,081
either.

1542
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:15,561
Or though.

1543
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:15,920
Right.

1544
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,240
Good Bait could come either or.

1545
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:17,781
I mean,

1546
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:21,020
there's a reason why they do these
fucking FEMA tests and they have,

1547
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:21,471
you know,

1548
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,740
giant stockpiles of plastic coffins,

1549
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,161
you know,

1550
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:26,390
that's all been documented.

1551
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:27,141
They've prepared,

1552
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:31,460
they have a lot of drills they prepared
for mass extinction events and you know,

1553
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:31,731
big,

1554
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:34,340
huge environmental catastrophes.

1555
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:35,540
Natural disasters.

1556
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:36,050
I mean,

1557
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,310
the government has camps,

1558
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,680
they have FEMA camps and these are real,

1559
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,101
you know,

1560
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:41,150
this is Alex Jones.

1561
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,781
You know when he'll,

1562
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:43,040
he'll start talking about FEMA camps,

1563
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:43,460
but there's,

1564
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,293
there's a real,

1565
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,420
they're really do have places where
they have cots set up and they have,

1566
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,500
they have fucking,

1567
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,790
almost like a prisoner of war camp because
if the shit really does hit the fan,

1568
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,211
you know,

1569
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:55,510
we get wiped out in
nuclear war or you know,

1570
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:55,800
or,

1571
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,390
or a fucking asteroid hits or something
nutty that fucks up the world.

1572
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:03,620
We really are going to have to detain a
lot of people were really going to have

1573
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:04,970
to calm everybody the fuck down.

1574
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:06,380
If we're going to evacuate areas,

1575
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,140
we're going to have to have
places to shelter these people.

1576
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,560
We're going to have to have buses were
women and children are crying and they're

1577
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:15,650
being separated from the father and
the father sitting there with a son and

1578
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,950
we'll meet you at the camp and then that's
real shit and they're going to get on

1579
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:21,590
buses and we're not going to know
where everybody is and we're not,

1580
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:22,730
some people are not going to be,

1581
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:23,900
that's possible.

1582
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,990
This is a fucking
fragile world we live in.

1583
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:27,680
Yeah,

1584
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,513
it's possible.

1585
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:28,800
You know,

1586
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,301
and little,

1587
00:44:29,301 --> 00:44:31,010
and then little colonies will get set up.

1588
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,400
Individuals will have different,

1589
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:32,821
you know,

1590
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:33,650
who knows how the,

1591
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,470
but the structure could break and at
that point some new system can emerge.

1592
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,030
It's almost,

1593
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:42,210
that's when we have to bring in the
Colombians bringing that fucking Iowasca

1594
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,230
donkeys in big clay pots
riding on the back of Don.

1595
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:48,170
He's in the whole wage.

1596
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,360
Oh Ya,

1597
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,640
Ya go?

1598
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,523
Yeah.

1599
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:55,021
You got it,

1600
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:55,290
man.

1601
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:55,500
Yeah,

1602
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,071
I can get in there,

1603
00:44:56,071 --> 00:44:56,430
dude.

1604
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,120
I could get down.

1605
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,550
I can get done with the Iwatch carols.

1606
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,500
You Cut.

1607
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,080
So what'd they say about smoking DMT?

1608
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:01,860
Would they say?

1609
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,041
Well,

1610
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:02,550
they said that

1611
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:03,660
that's just kind of a,

1612
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,680
it's kind of a rocket ship that plants
you right in that it right in that sixth

1613
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:08,190
dimension,

1614
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,450
but only the sixth dimension.

1615
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,280
The seventh and the eighth,

1616
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,780
they say mostly.

1617
00:45:12,781 --> 00:45:15,600
Mostly not because it's
too short of an experience.

1618
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:16,434
You can't really,

1619
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,050
you have to kind of
gather steam through the,

1620
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,850
through the dimensions
or something like that.

1621
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:26,470
And the smoking DMT kind of skips over
the fifth where you usually kind of start

1622
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:27,331
getting in these dreams.

1623
00:45:27,331 --> 00:45:28,290
It's like Wham,

1624
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,340
Bam into the six.

1625
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,730
And that's why they say that
there's some disorientation there.

1626
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,660
A lot of lessons to be learned and wisdom.

1627
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:35,400
Anytime you sneak outside of time,

1628
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,100
which is how they describe it
as sneaking outside of time,

1629
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,570
you have lessons to learn,

1630
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:40,770
but they're,

1631
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:41,011
you know,

1632
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:44,070
once you're there you have a short window
of time and you're trying to absorb as

1633
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:45,000
much as possible.

1634
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:45,510
Um,

1635
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,580
but the forces aren't
there to align you to help,

1636
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:47,970
you know,

1637
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,670
kind of push you farther because that's,

1638
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,960
that's a process you
have to gain knowledge.

1639
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,040
Like what happened to me,

1640
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,970
I had to download something or whatever
they said in the seventh to get,

1641
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:57,181
you know,

1642
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:57,931
to get that far.

1643
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:58,261
They're like,

1644
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:01,020
just have more steam
and energy to get there.

1645
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:02,190
And they talk about it as fuel.

1646
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:03,210
You know,

1647
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,540
the problem with the smoking
DMT is the fuel runs out.

1648
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:09,150
They have enough fuel to
like get you into orbit,

1649
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:09,721
you know,

1650
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:13,440
but it's not that extra afterburner
that's going to come in and shoot you to

1651
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:15,690
Mars after you're outside
of the atmosphere.

1652
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,050
You know,

1653
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,000
eventually it's just going
to suck you right back in.

1654
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:19,470
And so that's what they say.

1655
00:46:19,471 --> 00:46:19,751
The,

1656
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:20,700
the differences

1657
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:21,570
between those,

1658
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,700
the interesting because the intravenous
doses of DMT that like Strassman did in

1659
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:26,301
those studies,

1660
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:28,100
those people had 30 minute trips.

1661
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,041
That's,

1662
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,110
so I wonder if that's enough.

1663
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,660
I wonder if that's a different
teacher to a different place.

1664
00:46:32,661 --> 00:46:35,360
I didn't get to ask as opposed to be
a more intense experience when it's

1665
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:36,081
experienced.

1666
00:46:36,081 --> 00:46:36,680
Um,

1667
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,880
when it's done intravenously,

1668
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:42,740
it's supposed to be more a more
in depth and a lot more entities.

1669
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:43,400
Yeah.

1670
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,050
A lot more people being uh,

1671
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:45,590
you know,

1672
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:48,410
more of what they would describe.

1673
00:46:48,411 --> 00:46:52,040
That sounds remarkably similar
to Ufo abduction experiences.

1674
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,210
You know,

1675
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,960
that kind of thing that you're dealing
with these physical things in this other

1676
00:46:56,961 --> 00:46:57,794
place.

1677
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:58,850
Yeah.

1678
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,550
It's a real fucking symptom of our
culture that that shit's all illegal.

1679
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,600
That people can like,

1680
00:47:02,601 --> 00:47:06,350
you can come back and you get so fucked
up that you have to change your name and

1681
00:47:06,351 --> 00:47:07,184
it's still illegal.

1682
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,360
It's illegal.

1683
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,160
You know,

1684
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:09,540
a,

1685
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,580
it's really annoying.

1686
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,520
It's really annoying that we're
in this fucking nanny state.

1687
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,370
It's shitbag stupid nanny state country.

1688
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:17,580
Yeah.

1689
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,350
Do you find you any side effects at all?

1690
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:22,740
Like does your mind wander in
places over and over again?

1691
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:23,760
Do you have any different now?

1692
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:24,703
What was the,

1693
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,330
some of the challenges
were just reintegrating,

1694
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:27,661
you know,

1695
00:47:27,661 --> 00:47:31,360
and a lot of that's just you to this
different world and experience different

1696
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:31,750
things and,

1697
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,870
but do you leave your life on
the treadmill running full speed,

1698
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:35,321
you know?

1699
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:39,390
And I tried to hop right back the fuck
on and I got tripped up and slammed

1700
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,330
against the back wall.

1701
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:40,780
You know?

1702
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,800
Do you use that analogy?

1703
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:43,420
Like it's hard to get back,

1704
00:47:43,421 --> 00:47:43,661
you know,

1705
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:44,590
and hard to find,

1706
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,170
kind of the balance of integrating what,

1707
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,640
what you found out they're not.

1708
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:49,130
But

1709
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:53,960
do you guys feel like the world
doesn't seem the same when you,

1710
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:54,830
when you came back,

1711
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:57,680
do you feel that anything's
changed in the world?

1712
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:58,510
No.

1713
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:58,871
You know,

1714
00:47:58,871 --> 00:47:59,121
I,

1715
00:47:59,121 --> 00:47:59,880
I feel like,

1716
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,160
you know,

1717
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,993
I've,

1718
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:04,150
I've changed the way I
look at things has changed.

1719
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:04,451
You know,

1720
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:05,440
the fact that I can,

1721
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,430
I view myself now more like a needle
piercing a nine layered onion.

1722
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,001
You know,

1723
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:10,540
and I'm,

1724
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,520
you're consciously
aware of the first four,

1725
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:13,391
four layers,

1726
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:13,601
you know,

1727
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:14,590
that part of the needle,

1728
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:18,640
but you're still connected to another
five layers above you and you're just,

1729
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,960
you just don't see it,

1730
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:20,351
you know,

1731
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:23,320
just that very thought alone has changed,

1732
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:24,580
has changed my life.

1733
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:24,970
You know,

1734
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:28,270
it's hard to incorporate in
every day and everyday things.

1735
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:28,481
I mean,

1736
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:32,620
I've been focused pretty much solely on
launching Alpha brain and making sure

1737
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:34,330
that all goes well and it's been very,

1738
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,140
you know,

1739
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,160
very focused on that.

1740
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:37,960
But in my quiet moments,

1741
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:38,171
you know,

1742
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:39,100
when I can meditate,

1743
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:41,020
I can think back and think,

1744
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:41,470
you know,

1745
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:44,920
what I want to do next time I go down
there and what lessons I could learn and

1746
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:45,570
how,

1747
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:45,800
oh,

1748
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,580
he did an isolation tank son.

1749
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,050
That's your next step.

1750
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:49,620
I do.

1751
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:53,680
We sell some of these Alpha brains
enough to get you one morning glory.

1752
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,510
And so this is,

1753
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:57,780
this is the shit that we've been talking
about on Twitter and we've talked about

1754
00:48:57,781 --> 00:49:02,040
it on the podcast before and this is a
formula that Chris has put together and

1755
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:04,500
that we're selling and
it's called Alpha brain,

1756
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:07,590
and it fucking does something man.

1757
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,760
It first of all,

1758
00:49:08,761 --> 00:49:13,761
it gives you incredibly vivid dreams
and it seems to fire up your brain at a

1759
00:49:14,071 --> 00:49:17,700
higher rpm level or give you some clarity.

1760
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,300
I feel like it helps me
form sentences better,

1761
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:21,570
you know?

1762
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:22,403
You know what I'm saying?

1763
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:22,711
I mean,

1764
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:24,210
I don't know that that's what's doing it,

1765
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:24,901
but I feel like,

1766
00:49:24,901 --> 00:49:25,231
man,

1767
00:49:25,231 --> 00:49:28,200
I'm fucking talking pretty smooth
sometimes when I'm on this stuff.

1768
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,840
Technically what they say is that it
enhances Sydney synaptic plasticity,

1769
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,800
which is the way that your neurons
can kind of fit together and transfer

1770
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:37,320
information

1771
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:37,440
that,

1772
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,110
was this all peer reviewed
stuff or is it spiritual?

1773
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:40,370
No,

1774
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:41,880
it's a c rolling.

1775
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:42,760
Yeah.

1776
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,151
This is,

1777
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:45,150
this is purely on the scientific tap here.

1778
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:45,910
And what's it,

1779
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:46,600
what's in here?

1780
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,310
So what it is,

1781
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:47,450
it's

1782
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,570
a GPC calling,

1783
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,110
which is a great form of rock hauling,

1784
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,291
the best form of rock.

1785
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:55,620
Coleen really glycerophosphocholine
easily absorbed through the blood brain

1786
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:58,140
barrier where some of the
other Coline's or not.

1787
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:01,140
So it's most expensive
and best calling for you.

1788
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,970
And then we have hoopers Ia Serrata,

1789
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,550
which has a proven compound
called huperzine a,

1790
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:10,440
which is an Acetylcholine
esterase inhibitor and that
prevents the breakdown of

1791
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:11,790
the Acetylcholine in your brain.

1792
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,000
And what does see the calling
is in charge of is in charge of,

1793
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:15,421
you know,

1794
00:50:15,421 --> 00:50:16,021
focus,

1795
00:50:16,021 --> 00:50:16,530
memory,

1796
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:16,981
memory,

1797
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:17,814
clarity,

1798
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:17,971
uh,

1799
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:19,260
all the Alzheimer's treatments.

1800
00:50:19,261 --> 00:50:23,910
Currently almost all of them focus on
rehabilitating your acetylcholine levels

1801
00:50:23,911 --> 00:50:25,110
in boosting your acetylcholine.

1802
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:26,820
So even who presented a,

1803
00:50:26,821 --> 00:50:30,320
which is part of the Hoop Herzliya
Serrata has been tested in that capacity.

1804
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:31,760
So this is all very,

1805
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:32,151
you know,

1806
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:33,500
very scientifically proven.

1807
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:36,890
This is not anything Hokey pokey is
just the fact hire a pseudo cdot.

1808
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,030
Coleen levels lead to this.

1809
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,550
Now the problem with higher
acetylcholine levels,

1810
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,060
otherwise everybody would just be
jacked jacking their acetylcholine up,

1811
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,090
is it can lead to anxiety,

1812
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:48,080
anxiousness,

1813
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:49,370
a short temper.

1814
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:50,930
If that's too out of balance,

1815
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,190
you can get other,

1816
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:53,810
you can get kind of hyper aware.

1817
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:55,540
And so what I did with this formula,

1818
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:55,941
as I said,

1819
00:50:55,941 --> 00:50:56,330
all right,

1820
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,550
we want to have strong acetylcholine.

1821
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,120
It's good,

1822
00:50:59,120 --> 00:50:59,901
it helps your memory,

1823
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:00,980
helps your mental drives,

1824
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:01,850
help you focus.

1825
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,370
But we don't want to have
all the other things.

1826
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:08,720
So I created a balanced formula and I
included things like Gabba which controls

1827
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:13,610
kind of relaxation and kind of calm
and mental clarity in that kind of calm

1828
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:14,120
state.

1829
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,960
And then dopamine,

1830
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:18,290
which handles a lot of your movement
activities and some of your mental energy

1831
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:18,861
activities.

1832
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:19,010
Yeah,

1833
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:19,970
added dopamine.

1834
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:20,510
Well,

1835
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:20,990
um,

1836
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,920
it's Mucuna pruriens uh,

1837
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,750
contains a standardized
dose of 50% ELL Dopa and um,

1838
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:27,320
you can appear.

1839
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,180
Ends is a herb,

1840
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:28,540
I think,

1841
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,570
believe it grows in India.

1842
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,160
And so the 50% standardized l Dopa
is the building block for dopamine.

1843
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:34,791
So yeah,

1844
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:35,900
I didn't add dopamine.

1845
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:36,320
I actually,

1846
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,980
you're able to add a Gabba directly
because they're able to extract it from a

1847
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:40,814
plant.

1848
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,740
But the dopamine you have to get through,

1849
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,490
you know,

1850
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,020
pushing l Dopa and your body,

1851
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:46,250
your body will destroy it opened me.

1852
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:49,640
And if you try to put it in directly
so you build it yourself with El Dopa,

1853
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,070
uh,

1854
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,620
the catalyst and that is again,

1855
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:52,310
um,

1856
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,600
the pyridoxine Hcl,

1857
00:51:53,601 --> 00:51:55,490
vitamin B six which we have in there,

1858
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:56,390
which helps convert it.

1859
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,111
So,

1860
00:51:57,111 --> 00:51:57,441
and then,

1861
00:51:57,441 --> 00:52:00,500
then I've just put a ton of antioxidants
that are going to give you energy,

1862
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:00,830
uh,

1863
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:01,760
help your focus.

1864
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:05,670
The ACA 11 in there that was shown
to actually repair DNA and uh,

1865
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:07,520
scientific peer reviewed studies.

1866
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:11,780
So really fucking strong antioxidants
going to kind of eliminate some of that

1867
00:52:11,781 --> 00:52:12,471
mental fog,

1868
00:52:12,471 --> 00:52:17,150
cleared out some of your free radicals
and then allow the acetylcholine a boost

1869
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,130
to be manageable by the other,

1870
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,300
by the other components.

1871
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:21,111
Yeah.

1872
00:52:21,111 --> 00:52:23,240
Have you ever thought about
adding five HTP to it?

1873
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:28,100
Now that's another formula that I have
and Serotonin is a crucial component.

1874
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:30,530
Five HTP is the direct
building block of Serotonin.

1875
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,090
Um,

1876
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:33,110
it goes l Tryptophan to five HTP,

1877
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,320
five ht HTP then converts to five ht,

1878
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:37,280
which is serotonin.

1879
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,720
That's the fourth component.

1880
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:40,400
I have another separate formula,

1881
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:41,330
the rollover formula,

1882
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:44,600
which is specifically focused
on building serotonin.

1883
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:45,460
So,

1884
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:45,710
uh,

1885
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,330
being the fact that I have that there,

1886
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,320
there's just not that much room in the
capsules and it is important to have,

1887
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,580
but I recommend that,

1888
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:53,360
um,

1889
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:53,571
you know,

1890
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,130
that doesn't tend to,

1891
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,300
that doesn't need to be so much in
balance for this formula to work,

1892
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,800
but it is a crucial part of things.

1893
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:04,520
So I recommend either taking my
formula or another form of five HTP,

1894
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:09,410
but it was just a little bit much to
fit and efficacious dose of five HTP in

1895
00:53:09,411 --> 00:53:11,700
this Alpha brain to bring
that forth component.

1896
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:11,990
It,

1897
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:15,020
that's too bad because I know a lot of
people that have had a lot of positive

1898
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:16,490
effects with the five HTP is great.

1899
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:19,340
That's why I have a whole
product rowboat and roll over,

1900
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:19,950
roll over.

1901
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:20,151
Yeah.

1902
00:53:20,151 --> 00:53:23,180
My product rollover is
dedicated specifically to that.

1903
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:23,660
So you have a,

1904
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,040
you're selling those
and much smaller selling

1905
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,460
like four of those bottles,

1906
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,430
a 30 get bottles of 30 just like this.

1907
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,030
Yeah.

1908
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:31,920
And so do you recommend
people taking that?

1909
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:33,090
If they're not coming off of,

1910
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:33,390
uh,

1911
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:33,691
you know,

1912
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:34,800
the roll on roll off,

1913
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:38,720
it's supposed to be like you do Mtma
and then you're welcome anytime.

1914
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:40,300
If you're not sleeping,

1915
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:41,770
if you're stressed and
you're not sleeping,

1916
00:53:41,771 --> 00:53:44,140
that's when Serotonin is
produced is when you're sleeping.

1917
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:45,550
So if you're not sleeping,

1918
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,650
it doesn't matter if you're
partying and if you are doing,

1919
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,700
doing whatever you're doing,

1920
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,770
you're not going to be
producing enough serotonin.

1921
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,071
Right.

1922
00:53:51,071 --> 00:53:52,570
So that's when you need to take it.

1923
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:52,891
Uh,

1924
00:53:52,891 --> 00:53:53,381
so yeah,

1925
00:53:53,381 --> 00:53:56,020
I certainly recommend taking
it as part of the regimen.

1926
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,440
I mean that formula will probably change
a little bit and the next iteration I

1927
00:53:59,441 --> 00:54:00,490
have some ideas for it,

1928
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,150
but I'm going to always have
a serotonin specific formula.

1929
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:04,990
Um,

1930
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:05,410
you know,

1931
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:05,591
if,

1932
00:54:05,591 --> 00:54:09,820
if enough people want to have this Alpha
brain be that complete brain thing,

1933
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:10,840
we can look at it.

1934
00:54:10,841 --> 00:54:13,270
But just as far as dose and capsule size,

1935
00:54:13,271 --> 00:54:14,530
it's difficult to do everything.

1936
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:14,921
I mean,

1937
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:18,040
I have a capsule that's
specifically designed for Serotonin,

1938
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:19,480
the whole capsule capsule.

1939
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,560
It'd be way too much.

1940
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,370
It's tough.

1941
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:21,731
It's tough.

1942
00:54:21,731 --> 00:54:21,971
So you,

1943
00:54:21,971 --> 00:54:25,300
so that one was something that
I do recommend I do sell on,

1944
00:54:25,301 --> 00:54:26,051
on at.com,

1945
00:54:26,051 --> 00:54:26,550
but,

1946
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:26,920
um,

1947
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,090
it's not in the Alpha brain,

1948
00:54:28,091 --> 00:54:29,350
but I highly recommend it.

1949
00:54:29,351 --> 00:54:29,831
It's a great,

1950
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:30,790
it's a great thing to have.

1951
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,860
I use it all the time.

1952
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:32,400
I love it.

1953
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,900
I don't take it every day,

1954
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:37,470
but I definitely take it on like days
where I for sure feel jacked up in it.

1955
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,590
I think I,

1956
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:39,481
I've been taking for like,

1957
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:39,781
I don't know,

1958
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:40,350
like six,

1959
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,790
eight months here and there and I,

1960
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:41,970
I,

1961
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:42,840
it's one of my favorite things.

1962
00:54:42,841 --> 00:54:45,300
I though the roll on and roll
overs are my two favorite things.

1963
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:45,561
Yeah.

1964
00:54:45,561 --> 00:54:45,801
Those,

1965
00:54:45,801 --> 00:54:48,230
so those formulas will
change a little bit,

1966
00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:51,560
but I'm still going to always
keep that kind of concept and not,

1967
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:51,981
you know,

1968
00:54:51,981 --> 00:54:52,814
the Alpha brains,

1969
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,140
it's getting great feedback.

1970
00:54:54,141 --> 00:54:54,420
I know,

1971
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:54,800
you know,

1972
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,491
all of us here,

1973
00:54:55,491 --> 00:54:56,630
we all take it and we dig it.

1974
00:54:56,631 --> 00:54:56,910
So,

1975
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:57,180
uh,

1976
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,500
there's something going on with it.

1977
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,110
Most certainly does have an effect.

1978
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,033
Um,

1979
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:02,581
like I said,

1980
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:04,230
it gives me the most incredible dreams.

1981
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:04,510
Okay.

1982
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:08,290
So the reason why that's happening
is acetylcholine regulates rem sleep.

1983
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:09,610
That's what determines,

1984
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:09,911
you know,

1985
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:11,560
you get a wash of Acetylcholine,

1986
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:12,130
uh,

1987
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,390
during your rem sleep.

1988
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:17,950
So the fact that you have excess surpluses
of Acetylcholine created by the GPC

1989
00:55:17,951 --> 00:55:22,951
calling her Perseus serrata
allows a deeper and broader
wash of Acetylcholine to

1990
00:55:23,771 --> 00:55:24,604
go through,

1991
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,120
uh,

1992
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,020
your sleep cycles.

1993
00:55:26,021 --> 00:55:29,110
And so your rem sleep
becomes way more intense,

1994
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:31,540
longer and more vivid then,

1995
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:31,900
uh,

1996
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,550
when you do have low
levels of Acetylcholine.

1997
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:33,931
All right,

1998
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:35,460
so if you guys want to grab this,

1999
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:40,490
it's available now and
on it.com o n n I t.com.

2000
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:41,970
And uh,

2001
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:43,320
it's called Alpha brain.

2002
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,300
And tell me how you like it.

2003
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:48,040
I know some people have already
started taking it and uh,

2004
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:52,320
I have yet to talk to one person that
hasn't had positive experiences with it.

2005
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:53,663
And um,

2006
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:54,983
it's uh,

2007
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:55,500
no,

2008
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:55,801
what is it,

2009
00:55:55,801 --> 00:55:57,240
30 bucks for 30 of these things.

2010
00:55:57,241 --> 00:55:57,950
And people say,

2011
00:55:57,950 --> 00:55:58,200
oh,

2012
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:58,891
it's expensive,

2013
00:55:58,891 --> 00:55:59,581
but look,

2014
00:55:59,581 --> 00:55:59,851
this,

2015
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:01,260
the stuff's not cheap stuff.

2016
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:01,520
It's,

2017
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,190
it's what's needed to
actually have an effect.

2018
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:05,460
Yeah,

2019
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,620
I went expensive the best.

2020
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,450
I got the best ingredients I could,

2021
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:08,721
you know,

2022
00:56:08,721 --> 00:56:09,650
I cut no corners.

2023
00:56:09,651 --> 00:56:11,300
Everything's full spectrum standardize.

2024
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,880
So this is the best product
I can make and you know,

2025
00:56:13,881 --> 00:56:15,940
I hope people dig it because I fucking,

2026
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,040
I played my cards as well as I can and,

2027
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,050
and tried to make the best
in every aspect of doing it.

2028
00:56:21,051 --> 00:56:21,360
Yeah.

2029
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,360
Thanks for coming on and talking about
your psychedelic experience that made you

2030
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:26,150
change your name.

2031
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:31,150
I mean we thinking get you drunk on Jack
Daniels and you go to B and Duke turn

2032
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:32,830
you into some sort of fucking,

2033
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,830
after listening to that story though,

2034
00:56:34,831 --> 00:56:37,130
I would definitely change
my name to it seems like,

2035
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,160
and you've actually got to sit in that
thing and we talked with the ancient

2036
00:56:41,161 --> 00:56:41,941
aliens guy,

2037
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:44,160
the the big square that was cut out.

2038
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:44,920
You got to,

2039
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,800
you got the crew.

2040
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:46,703
Yeah.

2041
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,750
He's got a photo of him sitting in there.

2042
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:51,330
When we were talking to a Joe Su,

2043
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,940
Su sucralose from a ancient aliens,

2044
00:56:53,941 --> 00:56:58,380
he was talking to us about this area in
Peru where this stone is cut out and you

2045
00:56:58,381 --> 00:56:58,801
could see it,

2046
00:56:58,801 --> 00:57:00,270
if you'd go to the Ustream page,

2047
00:57:00,271 --> 00:57:02,270
he put a picture of Chris,

2048
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:02,821
excuse me,

2049
00:57:02,821 --> 00:57:04,860
Aubrey sitting inside this,

2050
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:09,150
this rock where it was cut out where
they have no idea how they cut it out

2051
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,021
because it was,

2052
00:57:10,021 --> 00:57:10,620
it's really,

2053
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,281
you have to see it.

2054
00:57:11,281 --> 00:57:12,840
What is the name of the place again?

2055
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,380
It's in the roads in the sacred valley.

2056
00:57:16,381 --> 00:57:18,890
I forget the name of
this actual ruin site,

2057
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,773
uh,

2058
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,311
calming to me,

2059
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:20,941
but it's,

2060
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:21,774
um,

2061
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:22,601
I,

2062
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:24,120
it was right there near,

2063
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:24,740
uh,

2064
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:24,960
you know,

2065
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,700
it's outside of Cusco by about an hour
and a half and you get to these ruin

2066
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:28,050
sites.

2067
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:28,620
Either way,

2068
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,520
it's dope.

2069
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,680
Go get some Alpha brain stupid.

2070
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:32,881
Yeah.

2071
00:57:32,881 --> 00:57:36,430
It does seem like one of the places
too bad he can't do Iowasca there.

2072
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,310
That would be the shit.

2073
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:38,611
Yeah.

2074
00:57:38,611 --> 00:57:43,611
I think that sounds fucking bad ass do
Iowasca at Chichen Itza or Machu Picchu

2075
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,140
or something like that.

2076
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:45,450
Yeah.

2077
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:47,520
At the ruins of some ancient civilization.

2078
00:57:47,521 --> 00:57:48,180
That that's what they,

2079
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:51,000
that's what they develop Machu
Picchu for as a spiritual center.

2080
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:54,150
Actually really it wasn't
like a political center.

2081
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,500
This was their spiritual home.

2082
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:56,221
Where did you hear that?

2083
00:57:56,221 --> 00:57:57,000
The rituals?

2084
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,121
Um,

2085
00:57:57,121 --> 00:58:01,230
the people there for me cause I thought
the cause modern Western folks have no

2086
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:02,640
fucking idea why it was created.

2087
00:58:02,641 --> 00:58:03,480
They don't have an idea.

2088
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:03,761
No,

2089
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:05,490
he had the Shaman Saul say this was there,

2090
00:58:05,491 --> 00:58:07,860
this was created as their
spiritual home and that's,

2091
00:58:07,861 --> 00:58:09,930
and that's why they created
it in such an odd spot.

2092
00:58:09,931 --> 00:58:11,100
The way that the mountains are around.

2093
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:13,650
There's speaking of law civilizations,

2094
00:58:13,651 --> 00:58:14,820
I'll be in Milwaukee

2095
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:21,330
August 13th at the Pabst
theater with Joey Coco Diaz.

2096
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,050
Tickets are on sale right now and uh,

2097
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,650
it's like half sold out already,

2098
00:58:25,651 --> 00:58:26,760
so don't sleep.

2099
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:30,060
And then also on September 23rd,

2100
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,390
Joey and I will be in Denver,

2101
00:58:33,391 --> 00:58:36,360
Colorado at the paramount theater.

2102
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:41,390
And that is also just about half sold
out now Denver showing lots of love.

2103
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:45,120
I can't wait to come back to Colorado
where I will eventually go when the shit

2104
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:47,370
hits the fan and society crumbles.

2105
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:51,000
And I have to live in the
woods near where my dog died.

2106
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,140
Folks,

2107
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,760
that's the end of this fucking show.

2108
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,620
We've had a fantastic time.

2109
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,810
Chris and I are going to
go check out red state.

2110
00:58:57,811 --> 00:59:01,800
We're going to go see the premiere of
Kevin Smith new movie and we'll have a

2111
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,540
full report on that.

2112
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:06,690

S.

2130
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:19,260
That's on Twitter.

2131
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,490
Follow Red Ban.

2132
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:24,380
He's very upset about his Twitter numbers.

2133
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:27,950
Obsesses on it on a daily.

2134
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,181
And why you ran it.

2135
00:59:29,181 --> 00:59:31,160
Follow me to your fucking freaks.

2136
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:32,930
We're not falling Joe already.

2137
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:33,764
You're ridiculous.

2138
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,360
How dare you.

2139
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,370
How dare you if you're not following me.

2140
00:59:37,371 --> 00:59:38,960
I'm trying to hit a million people.

2141
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,450
I'm only at 413,000.

2142
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:42,920
I don't feel validated.

2143
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:44,150
All right.

2144
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,260
That was a moment of weakness.

2145
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,300
Back to reality.

2146
00:59:47,301 --> 00:59:48,800

journey through the world of snakes.

2151
00:59:56,361 --> 00:59:59,780
Did and go to that with a fleshlight end.

2152
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:02,300

2153

How the Shama feel about sex toys?

2159
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:18,943
Are they cool with that?

2160
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:19,911
I think they're down.

2161
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:21,190
He's got like five kids though.

2162
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:22,523
Have you could use,

2163
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,593

2164
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:24,750
Pulled up on his urges.

2165
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,540
