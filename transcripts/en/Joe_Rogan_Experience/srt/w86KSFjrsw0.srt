Eddie discount.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,850
And Chris will tell you
he used to be Chris.

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,810
That's a long story.

13
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:28,830
No,

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,663
his name is Aubrey.

15
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,601
It's going to get dirty.

16
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:31,434
Ladies and gentlemen,

17
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,670
my Buddy Chris,

18
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:33,570
formerly known as Chris,

19
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:34,021
the artist,

20
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:35,040
formerly known as Chris.

21
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,340
Isn't the house Chris though.

22
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,243
What's up?

23
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,780
Buckle up pitches.

24
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,460
The Joe Rogan experience.

25
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,603
They get stopped.

26
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,510
[inaudible]

27
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,460
this podcast is,

28
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:56,000
uh,

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,130
been very interesting
for a number of reasons.

30
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:58,760
A,

31
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,040
it's been a weird little ride.

32
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,540
Unexpected we never thought were going
to do this to so totally came out of

33
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:06,030
nowhere.

34
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,580
Just me and Brian just fucking around.

35
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,620
But one of the

36
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,240
best parts about it has been the,

37
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,103
uh,

38
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,470
the ability to get all these
people together to get,

39
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:18,771
uh,

40
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:19,371
all these,

41
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,204
uh,

42
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,970
cool dudes that were friends with and
really spend a lot of time with them,

43
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:26,270
much more time than we would have
spent with them talking about shit,

44
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:27,500
if we didn't have a podcast,

45
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,161
you know,

46
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:29,810
like Brian Kaylin and I mean,

47
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:32,000
we've really gotten
deep into who Dunkin is.

48
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:32,181
Man.

49
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:34,850
I know Dunkin so much
more over this last year.

50
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,320
Yeah.

51
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,390
So it went from like going to a comedy
club and saying hi to somebody like,

52
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,511
oh,

53
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:42,140
how was your week to actually digging
into this person for two to three hours?

54
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:42,830
Yeah.

55
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,663
Finding out

56
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,930
their thoughts on everything.

57
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,741
Politics,

58
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:47,401
religion,

59
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:48,360
life and death.

60
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:48,811
And,

61
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:49,644
um,

62
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,250
Chris is one of the,

63
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:51,420
uh,

64
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,400
more interesting cats that
we've met along the way,

65
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:57,780
and he's responsible for getting
us together with the flashlight.

66
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,360
Uh,

67
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,801
that was,

68
00:01:58,801 --> 00:01:58,910
uh,

69
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,970
the first group,

70
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,250
the first person ever that
offered to sponsor us,

71
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,301
you know,

72
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:03,721
and,

73
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:04,554
uh,

74
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,790
and he's also,

75
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:06,624
um,

76
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,440
you know,

77
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,510
he's an interesting dude and he's,

78
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,030
uh,

79
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,010
I'm glad that we met.

80
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:11,221
You're,

81
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:11,521
you're,

82
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:11,851
you're,

83
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:12,400
um,

84
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,090
you're a unique character and a real one.

85
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,901
You're a real one.

86
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:18,330
There's a lot of people out there
pretending to be guys like you,

87
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,460
but they're not really,

88
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,540
you know what I'm saying?

89
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,171
Like,

90
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:23,004
uh,

91
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:23,881
you're,

92
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:24,451
you're just,

93
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:25,284
um,

94
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,340
I'm just very happy we met.

95
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:28,080
I'm very happy we're friends like this,

96
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,530
uh,

97
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,910
this latest experience that you have gone
on as one of the reasons why I really,

98
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,863
I really did you,

99
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:34,710
um,

100
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,840
he's the real gently,

101
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,870
he's the real deal.

102
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,470
He got off and he flew
to fucking Peru and uh,

103
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,950
he went to the jungle with
those root eaten motherfuckers.

104
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,770
And how did you sleep in camps?

105
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:46,411
What did you yeah,

106
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:47,490
it was a little hot open.

107
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:48,750
How many days were you down there for?

108
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,411
I was in a,

109
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:53,460
in the jungle for six and then out in
the mountains for another six or seven.

110
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:53,731
No,

111
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:56,130
he got so fucked up on the style of Wasco.

112
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,620
Then he changed his name died Joe.

113
00:02:58,621 --> 00:02:59,381
I had to come back.

114
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:00,040
Something else.

115
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,331
He,

116
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:00,851
he changed.

117
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:01,690
He used to be Chris,

118
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:02,830
and now he's Aubrey

119
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,090
or you're murdered somebody
and you're running,

120
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,030
running from the Peruvian authority.

121
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,620
Fascinated.

122
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,580
I'm perplexed.

123
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,630
I'm horrified.

124
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm all of the above.

125
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,540
Uh,

126
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,220
so let's get into it.

127
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,240
So how did you find out about this,

128
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:19,120
this place?

129
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,781
How do you,

130
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:20,440
uh,

131
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,630
for those who don't know what Iowasca is,

132
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,170
Iowasca is the orally active version of
the most potent psychedelic drug known

133
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:29,981
to man,

134
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:34,570
which is dimethyltryptamine
and dimethyltryptamine
is produced by the human

135
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:35,404
body.

136
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,970
They don't understand why,

137
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,641
but they,

138
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:38,110
they,

139
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,770
they believe that it's produced during
heavy rem sleep and during periods of

140
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:42,551
extreme stress,

141
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:43,600
they don't know what it is.

142
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,430
They don't know what it's real,

143
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,270
true function is.

144
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:51,271
But they do know that it is the
most incredible hallucination,

145
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,660
hallucination,

146
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:54,640
creating visionary,

147
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,370
psychedelic experience known to man.

148
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,110
It's mind boggling,

149
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,520
incredible experience.

150
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,850
But it's not orally active cause it's
in so many different plants that if you,

151
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,420
uh,

152
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,430
if you got it orally from eating it,

153
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:09,970
man,

154
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,690
you people would go on DMT trips all
the time because it's an all sorts of

155
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:18,510
different grasses and plants
and usually in a combin atory,

156
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,000
um,

157
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,500
state with a bunch of other,

158
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,101
you know,

159
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:25,270
whether they're active or
non psychoactive ingredients.

160
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,980
Like some plants actually contain five
methoxy Diane dimethyl trip doing,

161
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:34,981
which is another form of DMT that's a
justice I should actually more powerful

162
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:39,010
but unique and different than
the regular DMT experience.

163
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,900
But we're getting off track.

164
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,060
This W IOWASCA is,

165
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:48,061
is the Shamans of South America figured
out and no one knows how long ago they

166
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:48,790
figured this out,

167
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,230
whether it's a thousand years,

168
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,190
10,000 years,

169
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,770
it's all guesswork because
there's no written history of it.

170
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,020
They figured out how to combine the
reason why it's not orally active as your

171
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:02,170
stomach produces something
called mono aiming oxidase.

172
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,740
And that breaks down dimethyl
trip to mean in the oral form.

173
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:08,170
So once it gets to your stomach where any,

174
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,191
you know,

175
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:11,410
we're were like marijuana when you eat it,

176
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,970
it would get into your bloodstream.

177
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,260
What can cause the motto?

178
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:15,640
Aiming oxidase crushes it.

179
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,680
So what they figured out how to
do is take the route of one plant,

180
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,560
the leaves of one plant and
the vine of another plant.

181
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,050
And they don't even grow near each other.

182
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,430
They're on other completely other parts.

183
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:27,550
Yeah,

184
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,090
the Dongle.

185
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,090
And there's over a hundred thousand
different types of plants in the jungle.

186
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,940
So the fact that they figured out how
to do this and thousands of years ago,

187
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,350
and when you ask them,

188
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,840
who knows if they're
telling you the truth,

189
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,380
but what they say is that the
plants taught them how to do that.

190
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,180
They look at you like you're a big dummy.

191
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,800
When you asking me like how did you,

192
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,250
how did you find that out?

193
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:49,960
And they're like,

194
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,600
they told us.

195
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,250
I mean,

196
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:51,491
you know,

197
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:54,340
it's like that matter of fact when you're
talking to the real deal down there,

198
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:54,911
you know,

199
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:57,650
it's not like they come up
with an elaborate story.

200
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,640
They just look at you like,

201
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,050
well obviously they told us how he,

202
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,640
you think drink,

203
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,473
we just guessed,

204
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,021
you know,

205
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:03,810
like come on,

206
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,650
they told you.

207
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,401
Well,

208
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:06,211
you know what I mean?

209
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:07,360
That seems to be a,

210
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,970
an actual possibility.

211
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:13,830
That to me is more likely than they
figured it out through trial and error.

212
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,910
The combination there,

213
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:15,330
if you're,

214
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:15,541
you know,

215
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,140
I don't know,

216
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,810
I'm not a math unless cyber guy,

217
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,620
but it also could be evidence of an
ancient civilization that figured out,

218
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:22,981
you know,

219
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:26,760
plant pharmacology thousands
and thousands of years before.

220
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,840
I'm sure there's a lot of medicines that
are you putting two different things

221
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:31,790
that had nothing to do
with each other together.

222
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,523
There's,

223
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,270
there's one particular one called Cura,

224
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:35,931
which is,

225
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:38,660
which they use and if they don't
do it exactly the right way,

226
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,800
it's a deadly,

227
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,113
deadly,

228
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,200
toxic poison.

229
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,670
But the way that they're able to do it,

230
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,690
um,

231
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,380
you know,

232
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,080
it's just pretty miraculous that
punching people haven't died.

233
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,190
So there's plenty of examples.

234
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:49,450
Yeah,

235
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,170
it's a,

236
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,090
what is curare?

237
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,180
Is it an medicine?

238
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,121
I think it's a,

239
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,350
I think that's the medicine,

240
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:54,771
right?

241
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:55,640
I think there's a,

242
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:57,610
it's the way that they prepare it and uh,

243
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,300
I don't know some shit that they would
put on poison darts and shooting.

244
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:02,790
Oh Man.

245
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,623
Maybe I have that.

246
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,530
I don't know because I'm thinking
I'm only going from like Tarzan.

247
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,053
Yeah,

248
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,740
maybe that is the poison dart thing,

249
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:10,810
but you know how to spell it.

250
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,500
How do you spell it?

251
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,340
You are a

252
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,530
e c u r a r e

253
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,370
thing with the preparation.

254
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,390
I think of it where if they,

255
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:20,530
if they did it wrong,

256
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,190
Bam.

257
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,540
Nasad for common name for
various Arrow poisons.

258
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:24,871
Okay.

259
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:26,790
So that's originating in South America.

260
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,480
Well,

261
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,190
I guess if you do it right,

262
00:07:29,191 --> 00:07:33,240
it kills people maybe with the
boys or something like that.

263
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:34,230
But the point is,

264
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:38,310
it's amazing that these people
figured out long before we,

265
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,001
you know,

266
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:43,050
wherever driving cars or sending emails,

267
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,060
they figured out how to combine these
two plants and make an orally active

268
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,070
version of dimethyltryptamine that in
the words of the showman connects you to

269
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:54,090
the spirit world.

270
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,570
And the idea is that there is a world
that is all around us all the time,

271
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:01,380
but we just cannot tune into it.

272
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:06,381
And it is a world of souls and it is a
world of the afterlife and is a world of

273
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,250
non in bodied entities that are
to the experience or to the,

274
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:15,420
to the subjective person that's
having these experience there as real,

275
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,060
if not more real than this life itself.

276
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,130
I was their brother,

277
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,210
I saw it.

278
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,050
I mean I was in it and it was
completely indisputable for me.

279
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,660
And that was what was so life changing.

280
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,710
What was indisputable?

281
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,030
Tell us what happened.

282
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:32,400
You go down there and so you got to
write a whole thing to get in there.

283
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:32,830
What happened?

284
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,850
So it's kind of a school

285
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,960
I've been studying and training and,

286
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,620
and uh,

287
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,220
going to classes and things led by a
master showman who's found out the best in

288
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:41,910
South America,

289
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,840
learned from him for 30 years and is now
trying to teach people here in the u s

290
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,711
about it.

291
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:47,220
So,

292
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,400
uh,

293
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,390
in order to get into this,

294
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:50,010
this is kind of like the masterclass here.

295
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:53,160
This is the finishing course going down
and taking the medicine down in the,

296
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,301
in the Amazon.

297
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,610
So in to get admitted I had to write,

298
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:56,911
you know,

299
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,770
write a letter and they
reviewed it and you know,

300
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,340
did whatever they do to kind
of approve me to go along.

301
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,430
But eventually I was like,

302
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,080
did you have to go through any
stages besides writing the letter?

303
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,310
This is the masterclass.

304
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,940
This was,

305
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,661
it was kind of,

306
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:09,871
yeah,

307
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,060
this is like the uh,

308
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,530
this is like the ultimate
field trip at the end of the,

309
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,550
at the end of the school,

310
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:14,851
you know,

311
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:17,780
where you actually really
get to test out on you,

312
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,653
what you wrote.

313
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,621
Um,

314
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,910
I could get it in my email.

315
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,210
I would love to read it all.

316
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,110
It's cheesy glory cause
I know it has to be,

317
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,210
probably put some emotional shit in there.

318
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:27,481
Like,

319
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:28,910
Oh of course my cats.

320
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,850
No,

321
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,980
that's not the kind of
Shit you put in there man.

322
00:09:31,981 --> 00:09:34,920
He talked spiritual warrior
journey type of poetry shit.

323
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,010
You talk about your intent.

324
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,780
What did,

325
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,100
what did,

326
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,780
so what did you say in basically
a letter basically just said,

327
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,700
you know,

328
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,670
about my intent to explore
these realms of consciousness.

329
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,570
You know,

330
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,770
why I wanted to do it,

331
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:46,981
you know,

332
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:48,030
I wanted to go there,

333
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,721
learn,

334
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,220
grow and bring something back.

335
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,113
And um,

336
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,200
and that was,

337
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:52,710
you know,

338
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,640
really the gist of it.

339
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,380
And I sent it back to
you with a gold star.

340
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,071
Yeah,

341
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:57,270
they gave me the thumbs up.

342
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:59,940
There's a willy Wonka golden
ticket to meet the spirit world.

343
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,630
That's it.

344
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,050
That's it.

345
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,321
Okay.

346
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,160
So you get there,

347
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,203
you fly in,

348
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,080
so fly in,

349
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,850
you take a van out to the camp.

350
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:06,684
Like how do you get to the,

351
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:06,781
well,

352
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,990
we fly and then we take another flight
out to place called Puerto Maldonado and

353
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:10,824
one of these planes.

354
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,130
Decent size plant.

355
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:14,964
I've got a lot.

356
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,000
No,

357
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,190
no,

358
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,331
no.

359
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:17,060
I had a real job.

360
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,550
It was a jet.

361
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:17,781
Okay.

362
00:10:17,781 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah.

363
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,030
But then we take a,

364
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,280
then we take a canoe,

365
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:21,180
a two hour canoe.

366
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:21,541
I mean,

367
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,040
we arrived at credit mall and it's like a,

368
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,170
I'll tell you to go fuck yourself.

369
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,450
It's like a real third world country.

370
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:28,200
I mean it's just,

371
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,960
you smell feces and fish
and smiling happy people,

372
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:34,920
but it's like dust and diesel fuel and
it's one of those places to our canoe

373
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,440
just into the middle of nowhere.

374
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:37,530
Like on the Amazon,

375
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,011
Amazon,

376
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:39,450
the Madre de Dios river.

377
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,470
Since I've been watching a lot of
that Jeremy Wade's river monsters.

378
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:46,700
So I'm just looking at this muddy
brown water thinking of these way.

379
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,930
He that burrow through people flash
and soft fish and all those things he's

380
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,773
pulled out of there.

381
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,350
Um,

382
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:52,740
but yeah,

383
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,780
three hours up is,

384
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,040
you know,

385
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,740
two and a half or so up the,

386
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,170
up the river to this place.

387
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,530
It was just this eco lodge running on
generators out in the middle of the jungle

388
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,570
and generators that are fueled by,

389
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:04,860
is it bio diesel?

390
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:06,320
Like how do they straight diesel out?

391
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,950
Just get it from a source.

392
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:09,420
Do you have a truck
come by and deliver it?

393
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,620
They have one big ship comes up the
river and degenerate is on for a certain

394
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:14,040
amount of time,

395
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,910
about three hours,

396
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,960
three hours at a time.

397
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,570
So the hours,

398
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,480
refrigerators?

399
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,510
Um,

400
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:18,751
no,

401
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:20,070
not good ones I guess.

402
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:20,970
But the food was great,

403
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:21,510
so I didn't,

404
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,650
I didn't really probe too deeply.

405
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:26,310
Maybe they keep the kitchen
part on generation more,

406
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,580
but the lights and everything like that
that we got about two and a half hours a

407
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,090
day.

408
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,860
Wow.

409
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,230
Yeah.

410
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,500
So at nighttime it was just dark as
fuck and right when you'd start the

411
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:35,041
ceremony,

412
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,050
that's when the lights
would kick and it just boom.

413
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,580
And then with the canopies above,

414
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:39,990
I mean it's just cave black.

415
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,530
Now do they have to worry
about Jaguars that they do,

416
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,470
but the Jaguars is a very
sacred animal to them,

417
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:46,711
you know,

418
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:48,380
so it's cool.

419
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,260
Right,

420
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:49,770
right.

421
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,770
Well they believe that that's
what happens to us when we,

422
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:52,310
uh,

423
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,400
once he die anyways,

424
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,100
you ain't sacred

425
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,461
to them,

426
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:54,731
man,

427
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:55,480
I'll tell you that.

428
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:55,750
No,

429
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,800
they have a totally different fucking
game plan they're playing with totally

430
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:00,680
different rule book.

431
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:00,910
Yeah.

432
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,210
But there was Jaguar tracks while we
were there and some of the places we were

433
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:04,750
hiking,

434
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,430
God damn son,

435
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,010
Jaguars are like mountain
lions on steroids.

436
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,410
There's quote Ninja Ninja,

437
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:12,140
mountain lions.

438
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,030
They're killers,

439
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:13,211
man.

440
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:13,721
There's curious.

441
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:14,350
Fuck yeah.

442
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:14,651
Okay.

443
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,580
So you,

444
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,570
you get to this camp,

445
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,870
you were two hours on a canoe
and do you speak this language?

446
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:20,651
What language do they speak?

447
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:21,040
Spanish,

448
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,601
they speak spent.

449
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:22,810
Do you speak Spanish and Poquito.

450
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,310
Poquito so,

451
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,491
uh,

452
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:28,720
did you bring like Rosetta stone
with you or did you just kind of,

453
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,620
I dunno.

454
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,150
I mean just tried to get by.

455
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,390
It actually got a little bit tough for
when I was trying to speak about things

456
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:35,490
that are not commonplace.

457
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,370
Like with the my stroke,

458
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,330
the head Sharman let me
try and communicate with
external to call him maestro

459
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:41,240
maestro or don't,

460
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,560
don't Orlando my store Orlando was a,

461
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,360
was the guy I work with.

462
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,810
So Maestro is an interesting
name cause you know,

463
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:49,340
you think of someone
for a ride back to them,

464
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,250
their master of the plants,

465
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,130
what they call it.

466
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,020
So is that Spanish?

467
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:54,900
The plots show is a master master of the,

468
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,250
but these stuffs vegetal these tests,

469
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:57,491

470
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:57,790
Yeah.

471
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,310
And isn't that one of the names for the,

472
00:12:59,311 --> 00:12:59,590
there's,

473
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,340
there's two,

474
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,450
two different churches I believe in
North America that have one through the

475
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,320
supreme court.

476
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:10,321
The ability to take Iowasca in
a ceremonial Christian religion,

477
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,420
one that named Santo diamond.

478
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:14,750
The other one is the vegetal these stuff.

479
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:14,860
Yeah.

480
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,521
Something like that.

481
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:15,741
Yeah,

482
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:16,061
yeah,

483
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:16,450
yeah.

484
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,730
And they were in like New
Mexico or something like that.

485
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:19,830
So,

486
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,663
um,

487
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,630
you're down there in the jungle.

488
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,330
Okay.

489
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:23,651
You,

490
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:24,730
you get to the camp.

491
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,181
Do you say,

492
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:25,541
hi,

493
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:25,930
let's,

494
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,763
let's fucking do this.

495
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,420
We show up and there was
like a general orientation.

496
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:32,254
They feed us.

497
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,180
Great federally speaking.

498
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:34,014
You and English.

499
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,740
Both English and Spanish.

500
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,240
That organized?

501
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,040
It's organized.

502
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,320
Yeah.

503
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,150
There was like 50 of us going down there.

504
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,600
Really?

505
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:40,811
Yeah.

506
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:42,580
It was a big troop man.

507
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,240
See that would trip me out like getting
blasted with a bunch of Weirdos that I

508
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:47,110
didn't know it was,

509
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:47,861
it was interesting.

510
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,210
They were all super good natured,

511
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,640
but this is not the crew
that I would bring on board.

512
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:52,900
Like I see where the vessel,

513
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:53,710
if I was going to,

514
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,450
you know,

515
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,630
lots of broken people.

516
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:56,230
Right.

517
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,200
I think they started that way and this
was an answer for a lot of people,

518
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,770
but you know,

519
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,060
genuinely good people.

520
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:01,320
I was,

521
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,650
I was impressed to see that they weren't
a lot of these super kind of fraudulent

522
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:06,970
pseudo spiritual,

523
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,540
like,

524
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,890
I'm so connected,

525
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:09,071
you know,

526
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:10,450
they were like really good people.

527
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,080
Like they were,

528
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,010
they were out to help you.

529
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:12,844
But they,

530
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,620
there's,

531
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,000
they,

532
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,850
there's like the saltiest crew.

533
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:19,000
I would say that element
of insincerity is,

534
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:19,350
uh,

535
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,960
is really one of the biggest
problems with human beings.

536
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,210
And in a sense,

537
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:26,110
a lot of people,

538
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:26,980
whatever you become,

539
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:27,491
anything,

540
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,140
you got to fake it before you make it.

541
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:29,801
You know,

542
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:30,041
like,

543
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,320
I've had this conversation with
my friends about comics that are,

544
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:33,910
comics are just starting out and like the,

545
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,090
you know,

546
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,860
let's not fucking colligate
is fucking terrible.

547
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,251
I'm like,

548
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:36,731
God damn,

549
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:36,881
man,

550
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:38,320
if you saw me a weekend to my act,

551
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:39,400
you would want to kill me too.

552
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:39,851
You know,

553
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:40,601
I was a faker.

554
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:42,460
I was a faker until it became a comic.

555
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,250
But there's something
about the spiritual thing.

556
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:49,740
It's like faking spirituality
is one of the grossest thing.

557
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,010
It's even grosser faking being a

558
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,843
rock star.

559
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:53,211
You know,

560
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:56,330
like if you're in fucking high school
and you're wearing black nail Polish and

561
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:57,530
you're growing your hair long,

562
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,750
you decide to like fake,

563
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,160
like you're a rockstar until
you become a rock star.

564
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:01,671
You know what I mean?

565
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:04,150
Well cause faking to be a rockstar
actually helps you to be a rock.

566
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:06,950
Start faking to be spiritual actually
prevents you from being spiritual.

567
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:07,784
So it's,

568
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,200
it's the opposite that
isn't going to see it.

569
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,233
Yeah.

570
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,170
Spirituality has so much
to do at true humility.

571
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,950
Exactly.

572
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,130
And not worrying about
your fucking image and the,

573
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,401
they're,

574
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:24,401
the real issue with fake spiritual is
fake spirituality is that it's all about

575
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,370
the image.

576
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,370
It's all about projecting
this artificial piety,

577
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,880
this artificial,

578
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,843
you know,

579
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,681
sense of,

580
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:34,040
you know,

581
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,550
it's like,

582
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,930
it's like vegans that get real
uppity with you about Ken animals.

583
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,960
It's like what they're really doing
is they're taking a moral high ground.

584
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,580
They're taking a ground,

585
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,510
they're taking,

586
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,270
whether it's a Christian
ground or the spiritual ground,

587
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,130
they're pretending to be above you,

588
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:49,791
you know?

589
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,120
And they'll do it with
this spirituality or there.

590
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,950
I think now that I've gotten down there,

591
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:56,660
I think anybody be in kind of like that.

592
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:57,710
She just have to prove it.

593
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,130
Just drink up full capa.

594
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,470
Iowasca we were in,

595
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,400
see what happens.

596
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,480
We were in 24 hour,

597
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,190
24 hour fitness and I was with Eddie
Bravo back when he was in his most

598
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,210
ferocious,

599
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,650
there was a time when Eddie Bravo would
just try to hit on every pretty girl he

600
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:14,000
could run into the Falcon days,

601
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:14,660
could not,

602
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,141
could not,

603
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:15,974
not hit on them.

604
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,180
Long history,

605
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:18,590
so bad motherfucker.

606
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,670
He was being successful.

607
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:20,121
So he was,

608
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:22,040
he was knocking them out of
the park and just enjoying it.

609
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:22,660
But Anyway,

610
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,850
point is we're at a a gym and we're
lifting weights in this girl and this cute

611
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,280
little body and she's
talking to him and you know,

612
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,660
and Eddie is like,

613
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:30,290
so what's up?

614
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:30,471
You know,

615
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:31,071
where you from?

616
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:31,251
Blah,

617
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:31,401
blah,

618
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:32,120
blah.

619
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,870
And she was like,

620
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,081
Oh,

621
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:37,430
I'm from out of state and I'm really
not that happy with California.

622
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,780
And she was like real uppity.

623
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:39,883
And he's like,

624
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,581
what's up?

625
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:41,301
Like what's the matter?

626
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:41,870
She goes,

627
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,230
well,

628
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,860
you know what,

629
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,260
there's just a lack of spirituality here.

630
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,660
And I don't think that,

631
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:48,494
uh,

632
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,910
the men are very godlike.

633
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,200
That's what she actually said.

634
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,480
She actually said
they're not very godlike.

635
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,081
And we were like,

636
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:54,620
and I know,

637
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,100
and I was like right there with them.

638
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:56,361
It was like,

639
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:57,970
she said like,

640
00:16:57,971 --> 00:16:58,220
I want,

641
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,350
I don't want to start making fun of her,

642
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:02,900
but he says he's trying to
get laid so I'm being cool.

643
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:03,890
And I back off and I'm like,

644
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:04,850
fuck,

645
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,541
Oh God.

646
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,630
And then we're over work it out.

647
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:07,041
And he goes,

648
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,830
she didn't say God's
like the men are not God.

649
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,520
Like,

650
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,760
you know,

651
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,260
I guess what she was saying was like,

652
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:12,451
you know,

653
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:14,000
like living by the word of God.

654
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:14,720
Anyway,

655
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,710
long story short,

656
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,280
a week later we at the spearmint
Rhino Strip club in Van Nuys,

657
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:20,114
California,

658
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,370
who takes the stage right in front of us,

659
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,900
but God like,

660
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:24,923
are you serious?

661
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,310
Like in the all nudes trip
club with her hot little body.

662
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:33,020
We'll look at a right at
our little asshole and she
looks at us and the fucking

663
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:33,950
poor girl,

664
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,790
she remembered us from the gym and she
remembered that that was the day that she

665
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,580
had probably chosen to
try out this new persona.

666
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:40,970
You know,

667
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,840
crazy strippers.

668
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:45,200
One day they're super religious and
one day they're fucking spiritual.

669
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:47,360
The next day they're going
to be a yoga teacher.

670
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,440
Now they're fucking lost.

671
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:49,230
That's why they're stripping.

672
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,190
It wasn't God like,

673
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,870
like perfect body face,

674
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,100
everything like that.

675
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:54,190
Like not religious neither.

676
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:54,441
No,

677
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,274
no,

678
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,370
no.

679
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:56,970
She was,

680
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,240
no,

681
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,431
no,

682
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:57,590
no,

683
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:57,741
no,

684
00:17:57,741 --> 00:17:57,861
no,

685
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:57,991
no.

686
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:58,990
It was clearly,

687
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:01,210
she was talking about
spirituality first she said,

688
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:02,050
men aren't spiritual.

689
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,460
And then she said they're not very god.

690
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:06,940
Like she was talking about the people
aren't spiritual in California and that

691
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:09,070
she's from a place where people are,

692
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,400
you know,

693
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,280
much more in tune with the way of God.

694
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:13,570
But it was hilarious.

695
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:14,650
Step clubs in the VAT,

696
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,513
the Nebraska

697
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,881
regular stroke code.

698
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:19,900
This shit is hard core.

699
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:22,450
This is a pussies and
assholes in your face.

700
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:22,931
And she's,

701
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:23,470
you know,

702
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,390
equivalent or butt and doing that thing
when they shake their butt up and down.

703
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:26,890
I'm like,

704
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,723
yeah,

705
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,920
but it's just God like,

706
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,400
anyway,

707
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,840
that's fig spiritual.

708
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,040
So you're in the jungle.

709
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,690
There's no fake spiritual people.

710
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:35,540
It's all genuine,

711
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:36,760
but it's,

712
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,990
it's like a very high percentage
of really any hot chicks out there.

713
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,100
Um,

714
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,790
no,

715
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,090
no,

716
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,480
not really.

717
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,200
There was some,

718
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,350
there was something that
took care of themselves and,

719
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,410
and uh,

720
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:47,951
actually,

721
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:48,310
um,

722
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,450
I was able to go with my mother.

723
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,170
You went with your mother woke and sweet.

724
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,953
Cool.

725
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:54,230
Yeah.

726
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,560
It was one or two days.

727
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:56,081
That whole new,

728
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:56,890
a whole new world.

729
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,790
Really good mom.

730
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,240
Because she was a semifinalist
and Wimbledon pro athlete.

731
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,080
Wow.

732
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,860
Traveled the world.

733
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,700
No Shit.

734
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:04,534
I know that for sure.

735
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,261
Wow,

736
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:06,071
that's amazing.

737
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:08,350
So she has a mobster gangster shit.

738
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,260
My mom would get annoying
after a couple of days in Peru.

739
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:13,900
I could tell tough action.

740
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,810
My mom is somewhere along the lines,

741
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,080
become a five year old.

742
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,150
Explain everything to her mom.

743
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:20,730
That's fake is,

744
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,570
that's a commercial what?

745
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,030
She'll send me things and he,

746
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,970
can you believe this?

747
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:25,301
No,

748
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:26,740
I can't because it's not real.

749
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,143
It's Bruce Lee.

750
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,000
Have you seen this?

751
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:31,960
You know,

752
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,530
but I don't think it'd be down with
going into the spirit world with her.

753
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,210
We were in a bus going off
a cliff and I have no choice

754
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,540
then we're taking that trip together.

755
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,470
But until then,

756
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,251
so,

757
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:45,880
um,

758
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,290
you get down there with your mom,

759
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,310
you're on a canoe,

760
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,680
you don't know did and did you
have to talk her into this?

761
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:51,840
Nah,

762
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,660
she was into it.

763
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,493
She was fired up.

764
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,940
So I think she was looking for,

765
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,690
she doesn't really have any
strong kind of set beliefs,

766
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,820
but she's like a look of rabid explorer.

767
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:02,160
She loves new adventures
and things like that.

768
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,960
So she knew I was into it and she's like,

769
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:04,201
yeah,

770
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,000
I'd love to do that.

771
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,020
So was she ever religious at all?

772
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,740
No,

773
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,510
not really now.

774
00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:09,931
But she's,

775
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:10,201
you know,

776
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:11,400
she's just open to things,

777
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:11,781
but she has,

778
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:14,490
it doesn't really formed her
own paradigm necessarily.

779
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:17,730
She knows enough to discard the
bullshit monotheistic paradigm.

780
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:18,000
She's like,

781
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,240
all right,

782
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,960
that's not true.

783
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,580
But she hasn't really gone
the other way to say like,

784
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:21,930
all right,

785
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,670
what else can I construct now?

786
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,710
Before she did this Iowasca trip,

787
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:27,630
did she have any psychedelic experiences,

788
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,720
like a bad acid trip back in
college or something like that.

789
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:34,620
So pretty much did you talk or
any of this or a little bit?

790
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,221
A little bit.

791
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:35,581
She was,

792
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,980
she was a bit nervous about
that aspect of old your mom.

793
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:38,610
Um,

794
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,770
60 ish,

795
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,940
I should probably say

796
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,310
crazy,

797
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,130
but she was a,

798
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:45,391
you know,

799
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:49,060
they do a really good job when you get
down explaining every one of the Shamans

800
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:49,690
we met,

801
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,520
I'm kinda jumping ahead
in the story a bit,

802
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:54,130
but explaining how it's 100% medicine.

803
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,070
Like all of them,

804
00:20:55,071 --> 00:20:55,331
they're like,

805
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:56,350
this is medicine.

806
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,610
You don't do this for fun.

807
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,110
You do this to cleanse your body,

808
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:00,100
to cleanse your organs.

809
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:02,530
You purge it and it shows
you things you know,

810
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:03,490
and there's a wisdom to it.

811
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:06,790
It's a hundred percent medicine and they
get really offended when you call it a

812
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:07,390
drug,

813
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:07,601
you know,

814
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,401
to them it's a medicine.

815
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,430
It's the master medicine.

816
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,151
Like you said,

817
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:14,290
it's the medicine that they believe has
helped them find all other medicines in

818
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,070
the jungle.

819
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,311
You know,

820
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:16,390
they take the IOWASCA,

821
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:19,510
they go in and that's how they find
their other cures and all of these

822
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:19,931
showman's,

823
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:22,930
these veggie least as I
WASC is just one part of it.

824
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:24,040
But it's to them,

825
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,810
that's their master sacred medicine.

826
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,270
So

827
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,570
I lost her so bad ass.

828
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:29,180
So they don't give a fuck about mushrooms.

829
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,140
Yeah.

830
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,860
Schamens likes playing
with that shit for sure.

831
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,860
We playing with that shit for it.

832
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:33,981
Yeah.

833
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:37,790
You're going to see some crazy ass take
symbols and you don't need put that down

834
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:38,571
and have a drink of this.

835
00:21:38,571 --> 00:21:39,404
Yeah.

836
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,790
But you know what they do say?

837
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:41,570
They say,

838
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,720
you know you can't always get Iowasca
so they recommend that mushroom is when

839
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:45,091
you can,

840
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:48,530
I have every every two months they're
like every two months you better do

841
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:49,760
something and if you've got mushrooms,

842
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:50,594
great

843
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,810
every two months you should be setting.

844
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,320
That's a good segue because they say
you need to hit that reset button,

845
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,010
reconnect with the earth mother.

846
00:21:58,011 --> 00:21:59,130
And you know that kind of,

847
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,120
which of them is just a
representation of the the Yin side,

848
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,710
that kind of every two months,

849
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:04,860
nature side of the house.

850
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,570
I've had some DMT experiences
that were so intense.

851
00:22:08,571 --> 00:22:09,590
I took years off.

852
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,250
I was just like,

853
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:11,540
Whoa,

854
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,920
I need to think about this.

855
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,060
But DMT,

856
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:19,061
the orally active version is much slower
and more gradual and you can kind of

857
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,440
tune in and out of it.

858
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:26,000
You can get in the meditative state
when it's full blown or as it's slipping

859
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:26,331
away,

860
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:29,390
you can get right back in there
if you relax and tune into it.

861
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,663
If you're a warrior,

862
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,851
if you're a warrior.

863
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:32,600
But if it's crap,

864
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,380
if you're a career,

865
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,131
if you're cracked,

866
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:36,160
it's gonna fucking destroy you was,

867
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,130
yeah,

868
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,360
I'll get into that in the story.

869
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:40,370
But you have to know who you are.

870
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,580
You do before you start
fucking with this stuff.

871
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,101
It's happy.

872
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:44,360
They call it the vine of death.

873
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:44,840
You know,

874
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,250
that's the sign of the souls,

875
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:46,460
right?

876
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,900
Finding the soles are vying to death.

877
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,591
Find Out Death,

878
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:49,210
Huh?

879
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,043
Yeah.

880
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,300
Okay.

881
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,133
Swipe though.

882
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,491
So first night,

883
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:56,330
did they give you a little baby dose and
see if everybody should know how it go?

884
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:56,541
You know,

885
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,021
we get in,

886
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:58,070
we get assigned a roommate.

887
00:22:58,071 --> 00:22:59,150
I ended up with a lucky one.

888
00:22:59,151 --> 00:22:59,930
He was willing mate.

889
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,141
Yeah,

890
00:23:00,141 --> 00:23:02,060
we got to write an extra
to have your own tent.

891
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,061
Not on this one.

892
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:03,894
They didn't have the room.

893
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,103
Listen Bro,

894
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,880
I'll give you 50 coconuts.

895
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:09,650
Just give me my fucking 10 yeah,

896
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:10,484
for sure.

897
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,330
For sure.

898
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,410
But I'm that guy.

899
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:12,861
Yeah.

900
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:13,371
So he was,

901
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:13,911
he was cool.

902
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:14,651
He was an old Israel.

903
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:15,990
There are no suites here.

904
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,030
He's an old Israeli guys,

905
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,280
old Israeli tank commander
in water polo stuff.

906
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,290
They all know pay to be hanging out with.

907
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:24,440
Yeah.

908
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,910
The only other guy that was like,

909
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:26,301
I was like,

910
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:26,691
God,

911
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:27,291
I got lucky.

912
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,340
Like this is fucking sweet.

913
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:29,001
He was a cool dude.

914
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:29,230
I,

915
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,070
I'm still in touch with them.

916
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,710
Oh Wow.

917
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,280
Wade and me and him were the
most different out of it.

918
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,730
Everybody else in the whole group,

919
00:23:34,731 --> 00:23:36,110
everybody else was definitely,

920
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,190
you know,

921
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,580
not,

922
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:37,761
you know,

923
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:38,241
as I said,

924
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:40,180
not the saltiest bunch
you've got to bring out.

925
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:40,610
Wow.

926
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,001
Okay.

927
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:41,531
So Do,

928
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:45,860
do they slowly let you dip your
feet in the barn as you in and uh,

929
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,070
and

930
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,240
they announced the three Shamans,

931
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:50,600
they flown in the three best
schamens improve basically,

932
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:50,960
uh,

933
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,830
from different camps,

934
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:52,820
different parts of the jungle.

935
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,500
One is local to where they're at.

936
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,050
So it's like a battle of
the DJ's this exactly.

937
00:23:57,051 --> 00:23:58,460
And you choose which one
you want to work with.

938
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:02,610
So they announced the first one a long
lineage of what he's done and he kind of

939
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,900
integrate some of the Christian
saints with some of the Iowasca work,

940
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:09,920
works with the masculine aspects as
a big bio of all he's accomplished.

941
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,551
So it's like,

942
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:10,851
all right,

943
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:11,151
whatever,

944
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:12,890
but I'm not really going to be into the,

945
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:13,131
you know,

946
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:14,720
kind of mixing of the Christian ideal.

947
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,190
So wait for the second guy,

948
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:20,930
he has his own psychology clinic and
then in the jungle and he's helped build

949
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:21,890
this hospital and blah,

950
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:22,011
blah,

951
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:22,161
blah,

952
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,600
another big long thing.

953
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:25,970
And he sings he sweet songs and
then they get to the third guy.

954
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:26,781
And,

955
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:27,000
uh,

956
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,741
the third guy,

957
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:31,520
they say only say he's the most
traditional and the most terrifying.

958
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,800
He calls upon the spirit of
the dragon and that's it.

959
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,641
That's all I said.

960
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:35,360
And I was like,

961
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,160
does my gods,

962
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,993
my guy,

963
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,080
that's all he said about him.

964
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:41,330
That's all I said about
less is more people.

965
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,970
It's a Clint Eastwood
approach to shamanism.

966
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:44,510
Yup.

967
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,021
Exactly.

968
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:45,854
So,

969
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,311
okay.

970
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:46,881
So um,

971
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:47,810
it was just the first night,

972
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,330
the first night they go right into it.

973
00:24:50,331 --> 00:24:50,980
Right into it.

974
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,410
Wow.

975
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:51,741
Okay.

976
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:52,550
So Day one,

977
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,630
they won't pull up in a canoe.

978
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:55,000
What time do you actually
get to the campus?

979
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,420
It knew about three 30,

980
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:57,380
three 30 in the afternoon.

981
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,530
Do you eat first or no,

982
00:24:58,531 --> 00:24:58,940
eat.

983
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,420
We ate,

984
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,890
we ate right then at three 30,

985
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:01,640
but then that's it.

986
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,390
No dinner.

987
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:02,601
Right.

988
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,070
Cause the ceremony starts at eight 30.

989
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:04,611
Okay.

990
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:06,380
So they recommend five hours.

991
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:06,771
That's it.

992
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:07,700
To purge your system.

993
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:08,251
I thought it was like,

994
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:09,590
well they will ask for 12.

995
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,693
Um,

996
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,050
this one they didn't,

997
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,381
you know,

998
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:14,990
but the food that they're
serving is like jungle food,

999
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,590
you know,

1000
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,371
it's like light.

1001
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:16,971
It's clean,

1002
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:18,080
it's all grown out there.

1003
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:18,750
They eat.

1004
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,583
What kind of food?

1005
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,110
A lot of vegetables.

1006
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:21,944
A lot Chenwa.

1007
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:22,580
Um,

1008
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,361
they had some,

1009
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:23,601
you know,

1010
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:27,620
like fresh free range chicken and
a lot of tilapia type of fish,

1011
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,581
things like that.

1012
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:31,110
Like really kind of light and the
catching everything in their cells.

1013
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,820
Yeah.

1014
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,600
Wow.

1015
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,440
So um,

1016
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,670
yeah you eat,

1017
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,240
you sit around and just wait for the party
began on my roommate and kind of wait

1018
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:41,540
for it and then they talk about a little
bit and then you have a few minutes to

1019
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,300
kind of gather yourself
and get ready for the uh,

1020
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,710
and maybe like rolling it all day.

1021
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,380
These guys brought it from their
homes so they brew it in their home,

1022
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,240
so each each,

1023
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,080
so he didn't mind.

1024
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,381
They don't,

1025
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:53,780
you don't get to watch them
now they have to boil it,

1026
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,741
boil one,

1027
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:55,491
boil the other,

1028
00:25:55,491 --> 00:25:56,010
mix it.

1029
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:00,020
But it was my has their own secret
perfect recipe that they've learned from

1030
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,710
Taiwan.

1031
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,860
I would want to see them cook it
because after the movie altered states,

1032
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,390
that was one of the trippiest parts.

1033
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:06,560
When the guy was cooking up to shit,

1034
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,371
I want to see them cook it.

1035
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:10,400
Like you can't just pull it out of a
fucking Tupperware container for me,

1036
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:10,760
man.

1037
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,630
I want to see it cook it.

1038
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,111
I actually,

1039
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:16,500
there's a video I posted on my blog
kind of midway down on a warrior poet.us

1040
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,670
that has actually the meister that I
work with and it shows some pictures of

1041
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:21,710
them boiling it with the big sticks.

1042
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,660
And it has like a big cast iron pots to
put up two different pots brewing side

1043
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:27,830
by side one with the leaf,

1044
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:28,790
I think in one with a,

1045
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,420
with a vice,

1046
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,560
a long ass time,

1047
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:30,830
right?

1048
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,130
Yeah.

1049
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:31,641
It's not quite,

1050
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:33,260
it takes like 10 hours
or something to make.

1051
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:34,370
Okay.

1052
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:34,791
So,

1053
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:35,180
um,

1054
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,820
they sit you down and how do
they determine the dosage?

1055
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,601
Well,

1056
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:38,851
it's,

1057
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:40,720
it's an eyeball test from the shotgun.

1058
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,780
So we walk in,

1059
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:41,950
we,

1060
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,470
I have,

1061
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,450
I have by the fewest people with our
group because people were scared of the

1062
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:46,860
dragon and it denying,

1063
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,630
so I had like 10 people,

1064
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:51,300
so we don't have a small hut and
the secluded part of the jungle.

1065
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:53,190
So along walk my,

1066
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:53,520
uh,

1067
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,000
my fearless compatriots were kind of
laughing and joking around and I felt

1068
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:57,421
confident,

1069
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:58,650
but I was very calm.

1070
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:01,170
I knew I was going into
some pretty intense work,

1071
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:01,411
you know,

1072
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,130
so,

1073
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:02,640
um,

1074
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,240
we had it,

1075
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,350
we get in there and then,

1076
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:04,591
you know,

1077
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:06,460
they do some of the opening ceremony of

1078
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,770
k.

1079
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,603
Dot.

1080
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,900
So all of us are faced like spokes of
a wheel towards the center of the room

1081
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,620
and we all have a puke bucket
kind of near us because,

1082
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:17,980
you know,

1083
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,380
most people purge during this process.

1084
00:27:20,381 --> 00:27:21,700
It's part of the healing process.

1085
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,691
And then,

1086
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:23,320
uh,

1087
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,790
he calls us up one by one,

1088
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,810
kind of looks,

1089
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,050
you know,

1090
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,080
looks at you who assesses
and then pours a coconut,

1091
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,490
the pours the Iowasca and like
a polished coconut husk and uh,

1092
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,560
and you drink and it is,

1093
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:40,620
it is thick and bitter and just
tastes like earth in like Derek fire.

1094
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,560
They're like,

1095
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,310
it's,

1096
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,270
it's tough.

1097
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,930
I mean it's,

1098
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:44,980
it's tough to go down.

1099
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:45,760
I mean,

1100
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,230
it's very thick.

1101
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:48,520
And did everyone drinking?

1102
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,960
Did anybody did at once?

1103
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:50,681
You're in the ceremony,

1104
00:27:50,681 --> 00:27:51,430
you got to drink.

1105
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,090
No,

1106
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,301
no.

1107
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:52,931
Observers know,

1108
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:54,640
peeping toms on the action there.

1109
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,500
Does the showman get in as well?

1110
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,110
He does.

1111
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,921
He but he drinks,

1112
00:27:57,921 --> 00:28:00,230
he drinks kind of steadily
throughout the thing.

1113
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:01,064
He doesn't,

1114
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,340
you know,

1115
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,210
he's kind of always drinking and
always cause that's how he creates his,

1116
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:05,871
you know,

1117
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:07,650
his world that he's

1118
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,590
so by creating his world,

1119
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:12,560
he's not just concocting the,

1120
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:13,470
the formula.

1121
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:16,340
He's also beating a
drum and blowing cigar,

1122
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,480
smoke tobacco smoke.

1123
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:19,314
And what is he doing?

1124
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,681
Yeah,

1125
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:20,514
so what,

1126
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,220
you know,

1127
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:21,911
30 minutes.

1128
00:28:21,911 --> 00:28:23,440
It was just silence in there.

1129
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:26,920
And then he starts what's called is
ecos and the Ikaros or his songs and the

1130
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:30,670
songs that was taught to
him by his grandfather who,

1131
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,030
you know,

1132
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,930
they trace it back,

1133
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:35,470
grandfather to father a man.

1134
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:36,131
I couldn't do it,

1135
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,320
but it can Trussell let's pull one up.

1136
00:28:38,321 --> 00:28:39,041
Can we pull one number?

1137
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:39,730
Can we play on that?

1138
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,180
It's like,

1139
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,691
yeah.

1140
00:28:40,691 --> 00:28:41,530
I mean it's a,

1141
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,830
it starts with ECO rose.

1142
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:45,521
How do you spell eco?

1143
00:28:45,521 --> 00:28:45,970

U.

1157
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,470
A.

1158
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,470
S.

1159
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,470
E.

A.

1161
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,301
Yeah.

1162
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:57,390
Well,

1163
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,290
I want to hear some of that shit.

1164
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:58,501
Yeah,

1165
00:28:58,501 --> 00:28:58,710
yeah,

1166
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:58,891
yeah.

1167
00:28:58,891 --> 00:28:59,491
Hold on a second.

1168
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:01,990
Get one of those and we'll play it on
the background while he's talking to,

1169
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,570
it'll be trippy as fuck.

1170
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,620
So this cat has his own separate eco
roast and the other two gentlemen have

1171
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:10,770
their own,

1172
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,300
and they have female Shamans as well,

1173
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:12,620
right?

1174
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,453
Yeah.

1175
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,951
Not here.

1176
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:15,371
They do,

1177
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:17,950
but not the IOWASCA arrows
in the vegetal east does.

1178
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:18,190
It's,

1179
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,290
it's kind of a very paternalistic,

1180
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,050
you know,

1181
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,251
could,

1182
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:22,020
it's not a heritage,

1183
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,811
a male dominated.

1184
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:24,680
It's not about like priests,

1185
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,210
right?

1186
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:25,650
No,

1187
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:26,280
no,

1188
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,410
no.

1189
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:26,740
It's,

1190
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,281
it's very,

1191
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:27,640
I mean,

1192
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,980
they worship higher than
anything is the earth mother.

1193
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,410
So it just happens to seem that the men,

1194
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,130
um,

1195
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,330
where the maestros in this case,

1196
00:29:34,331 --> 00:29:36,280
there's female Shamans for sure.

1197
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,480
They call them don't onions.

1198
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,870
My ester us.

1199
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,440
Um,

1200
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,070
and we,

1201
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,930
I was actually one in the,

1202
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:41,740
uh,

1203
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,050
but she wasn't an Ios Garrow necessarily.

1204
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:46,720
She was just a more General Sharman.

1205
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,500
But she was,

1206
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,370
she was smart too,

1207
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,204
and she was strong.

1208
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,950
You got something to,

1209
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,230
dude,

1210
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,063
what are you doing?

1211
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,133
Would that be it?

1212
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:54,651
Oh,

1213
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:55,484
let's hear it.

1214
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,040
It's too many instruments
in there obviously,

1215
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:01,530
but they use just like a
whistle in their voice.

1216
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:02,364
It's like,

1217
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:04,990
did you uh,

1218
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,330
look up eco rose?

1219
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,260
That's just Iowasca right.

1220
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,140
Put it that press,

1221
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:11,770
you know,

1222
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,730
enter right.

1223
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,253
Copy that shit.

1224
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,960
And then right eco rose.

1225
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,790
I see.

1226
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:17,991
Yeah.

1227
00:30:17,991 --> 00:30:22,991
That'll get you a R.

1228
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,110
O.

1229
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,110
S.

1230
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,110
I.

1231
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,110
C.

1232
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,110
A.

1233
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,110
R.

1234
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,110
O.

1235
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,110
S.

1236
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,110
I.

1237
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,110
C.

1238
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,110
A.

1239
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,110
R.

1240
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,120
S.

1241
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,953
Yeah.

1242
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,213
Yeah.

1243
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,430
Let me hear some craziness.

1244
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,403
Aw,

1245
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,170
Fuck John Tesh present.

1246
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,203
Judge

1247
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:39,743
Kenny G.

1248
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,700
Maybe it was a acre rose
over that shitty music.

1249
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,833
Yeah,

1250
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,710
it sounds more like,

1251
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,713
yeah,

1252
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,980
my guy didn't sound like that.

1253
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:00,420
He was a lot more basketball.

1254
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,303
Fine Buck.

1255
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,323
Um,

1256
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,601
yeah,

1257
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:03,434
that's it.

1258
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,090
Okay.

1259
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,180
So he only has,

1260
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:05,961
his tools are,

1261
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:07,220
he has his breath,

1262
00:31:07,221 --> 00:31:08,450
but you use this more than anything.

1263
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,130
And then he has a,

1264
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,840
he has a kind of a branch with a bunch
of leaves that he uses this sort of like

1265
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:18,250
a rattle and those are his tools
in his voice and his listening.

1266
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,220
So,

1267
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,810
and he also has some cinnamon sticks,

1268
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:21,740
which you choose at the end.

1269
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:22,490
But I'll get,

1270
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,323
I'll get to that.

1271
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,100
This is tripping me out.

1272
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,360
Put me back in

1273
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,140
back there.

1274
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,970
You're going to change
your name back to Chris.

1275
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:34,941
Okay.

1276
00:31:34,941 --> 00:31:37,310
So how long does it
take after you drink it?

1277
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,540
About 45 minutes.

1278
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:40,940
You start to feel people
rustling 30 to 45 minutes.

1279
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:41,301
It's hard.

1280
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:42,320
I mean it's cave dark.

1281
00:31:42,321 --> 00:31:44,180
You don't have a perfect
perception of time,

1282
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,860
but 30 to 45 minutes,

1283
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:46,760
people start to rustle.

1284
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:47,780
It starts to activate.

1285
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:48,970
How big is this came this,

1286
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,690
uh,

1287
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,240
um,

1288
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,100
probably 20 foot in diameter.

1289
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,090
So it's tight,

1290
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,320
tight quarters for 10 people.

1291
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,920
So it starts going and you know,

1292
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,060
you start to get that
energetic activation,

1293
00:31:59,061 --> 00:32:02,390
same as you do on mushrooms or something
where you know something's about to

1294
00:32:02,391 --> 00:32:02,781
happen,

1295
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:03,271
you're closed.

1296
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:07,220
I had visuals start to splash with
color and light and things like that.

1297
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:07,760
Um,

1298
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,520
your stomach starts to Gurgle
a little bit and then uh,

1299
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:12,590
so that was happening and
he started as he cross,

1300
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:12,831
you know,

1301
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:13,850
starts slowly,

1302
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,760
kind of like it is now
whistling and building,

1303
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:17,480
building.

1304
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,110
And then,

1305
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:18,381
you know,

1306
00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:19,490
at about an hour you here,

1307
00:32:19,491 --> 00:32:23,360
the first person just Rach like Ahhh.

1308
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,070
And it's not like just
a gentle bullying style.

1309
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,720
This is like years of rock just pouring
out of every organ that they have and

1310
00:32:31,911 --> 00:32:32,110
their,

1311
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,650
it's their half yelling,

1312
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,090
half puking when they do it.

1313
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,020
I mean he's like,

1314
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,853
ah.

1315
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,960
So it's not just the,

1316
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,640
the medicine coming up.

1317
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,810
There's like a,

1318
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,763
yeah,

1319
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,630
like a sacrifice or expelling
mio and things out of your,

1320
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,583
out of your organs.

1321
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,590
I didn't Puke till the second
paradigm shifting session,

1322
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:53,870
but you either goes out your,

1323
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,260
you know,

1324
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,990
you vomit or finds
another motive evacuation.

1325
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,100
But it's,

1326
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,120
you can feel it works.

1327
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:00,470
A lot of people shit themselves too.

1328
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:01,304
Is that what you're saying?

1329
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,930
It wouldn't be,

1330
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:03,410
yeah,

1331
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,020
it has the Tanner,

1332
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,150
they just shit themselves at all.

1333
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,180
And I'll explain all play Israeli guy.

1334
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,350
He was in a,

1335
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,090
he was in a different
session actually that time,

1336
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:11,924
so I wasn't there.

1337
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,571
But anyway,

1338
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:17,150
so the first people start to purge and
then pretty soon after that you smell

1339
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,780
farts.

1340
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,310
It was,

1341
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,070
yeah,

1342
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,290
it was just chaos erupts in the room.

1343
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,620
We all Michael Pants,

1344
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,350
like one of the,

1345
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,000
one of the ladies just turn
into a blithering child.

1346
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:26,181
I'm like,

1347
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:26,721
help me,

1348
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:27,171
help me,

1349
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:27,651
help me.

1350
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:30,870
But another person started pretending
that he could sing the gross,

1351
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,200
but it was like a kid that thinks
he knows the words to a song.

1352
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,080
She was like two beats
off and it was awful.

1353
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,590
And then another lady completely
lost her internal monologue.

1354
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,740
And this culminated throughout
the night and her finally saying,

1355
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,840
I can't tell if I shit my pants or if I
didn't shit my pants like over and over

1356
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:48,201
again.

1357
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:48,740
And I was like,

1358
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,820
Oh God,

1359
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,480
you know,

1360
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:50,751
I mean,

1361
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:52,220
this is so people,

1362
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:52,730
I mean,

1363
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,500
people who weren't ready cracked,

1364
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:54,951
you know,

1365
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:55,340
bad.

1366
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,031
I mean it wasn't,

1367
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:57,560
that's not the experience
you're supposed to get.

1368
00:33:57,561 --> 00:33:59,030
You're supposed to keep it to yourself,

1369
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,680
follow through to interfere with
your thoughts though on homeless.

1370
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:03,790
Throw you off that a
little bit freaking out.

1371
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,340
But it was,

1372
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,120
it was two pounds.

1373
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,550
And knowing that part,

1374
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,200
that part was rough in this first,

1375
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,100
in this first session.

1376
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:10,940
And then,

1377
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,181
you know,

1378
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:12,650
right as I'm starting to get,

1379
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:12,921
you know,

1380
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:14,210
get some serious visions.

1381
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:19,250
Lady next to me and I'd like shuttered
and she puked all over my socks.

1382
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,820
So they pitch black and I'm peeling off
the wet chunky wool from my feet and put

1383
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:26,780
him on the side and just
curl back up on my map.

1384
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,860
No way to clean it.

1385
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,620
It's fucking pitch black or in the
middle of the ceremony starting to trip

1386
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:31,454
balls.

1387
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,390
So that was,

1388
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:33,500
that was the start of it.

1389
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,130
Um,

1390
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,610
and it was kind of signatory for the way
the rest of the night went because it

1391
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:39,770
was intense and dark.

1392
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:40,663
And uh,

1393
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,833
you know,

1394
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,910
what started happening is snake
started coming in through the jungle.

1395
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:49,400
I had visions of snakes and they would
look at me and then immediately start

1396
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:53,030
savagely like going inside my
body and like eating my organs,

1397
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,260
eating my throat,

1398
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,040
like going down my throat and eating their
way out and like exploding through my

1399
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:58,850
body.

1400
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:02,810
And I know enough from psychedelic
experiences to just witness and allow and

1401
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:03,680
just let it happen.

1402
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:03,831
You know?

1403
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:04,880
Cause if you try and fight it,

1404
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,540
you're fucked.

1405
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,170
You're fucked.

1406
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:06,860
You can't,

1407
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,490
that is the number one reason
why people have bad trips.

1408
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:10,790
Yeah.

1409
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,380
They tried to control the experience.

1410
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,560
But did you think these snakes were real
or did you know they were kind of like,

1411
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,140
I was cool with this at this
point and then it switched.

1412
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,743
Yeah.

1413
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,290
Cool.

1414
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,160
Just think blasting.

1415
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,070
I kind of knew that the vine and
death was going to take me there.

1416
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,310
I had a feeling that these snakes,

1417
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,130
do they look like real snakes or do
you know that's a fucking real snake?

1418
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:33,080
I'm actually getting eaten
by a jungle snake right now.

1419
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:33,381
No,

1420
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,310
they were more like,

1421
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:35,050
um,

1422
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,230
there were a bit a femur or you know,

1423
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:39,540
they would change too much in color and
the way that they would come was not

1424
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,730
necessarily slithering on the ground.

1425
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:45,180
They were coming from the air
and they all top hats on snakes.

1426
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:45,421
Lou,

1427
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:46,800
they look like a lot of them,

1428
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:47,634
a lot of them were,

1429
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,510
were kind of white.

1430
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:48,751
They were,

1431
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:51,930
they looked actually the more like
boas or con or like anacondas not,

1432
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,780
not as much like domestic
snakes that we'd find out here,

1433
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:56,430
but they had that kind of jungle pattern.

1434
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:57,264
But they would,

1435
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:57,900
you know,

1436
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,770
the colors were off.

1437
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,311
They were not,

1438
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:00,980
they were either too colorful or they're,

1439
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,010
or they're white.

1440
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,630
They weren't like jungle colors,

1441
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:06,840
but they were that shape and
that size of these things.

1442
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:07,650
Um,

1443
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:11,310
so like you're tuning into
it but not totally correctly.

1444
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:16,200
Like as if you're on a station and the
colors are all off and the fucking,

1445
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:19,010
the cop outfit is white instead of blue.

1446
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,080
It's like in that skin
is blue instead of white.

1447
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:22,560
Yeah,

1448
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,393
exactly.

1449
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:23,881
So,

1450
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:24,300
um,

1451
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,860
so that was going on and then after I,

1452
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:26,130
you know,

1453
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,970
got used to that,

1454
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:31,971
then it switched and I kept sliding down
these binds of thorns that were just

1455
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:33,630
ripping me up to pieces.

1456
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:33,990
Again,

1457
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:38,250
all of these images were just total
destruction of the flesh and know you

1458
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:40,110
feeling anything while this is happening,

1459
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,300
you're kind of a passive observer of your,

1460
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:42,600
uh,

1461
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,433
of your body,

1462
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,680
seeing it in a third person
or yet outside of your body,

1463
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,000
about two feet,

1464
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,030
about two feet outside of your body
as you're watching this happen to you.

1465
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,010
So you're like looking down on it.

1466
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,450
Yeah,

1467
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,120
kind of like,

1468
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,480
you know,

1469
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,940
up here on your shoulder a
bit and just destruction,

1470
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:57,601
destruction.

1471
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:58,350
And I was,

1472
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,183
you know,

1473
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,980
I remember thinking myself because
I was naked when this was happening.

1474
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:02,281
I was like,

1475
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:04,020
why did I have to be naked in this thing?

1476
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,200
But that's just the way it was.

1477
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:07,260
It just me naked flash,

1478
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:08,530
just getting torn slide.

1479
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:13,530
And what do you see seen
blood and injuries and yeah,

1480
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,310
you do.

1481
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,031
You see it all.

1482
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:17,160
I mean just liquid
pouring out of your body.

1483
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:20,160
It's just complete destruction
of the physical form.

1484
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,120
And then,

1485
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,200
and then from there,

1486
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,560
you know,

1487
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,120
insects would burrow into my
body and explode and the cheese,

1488
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,690
the spiders and things would go.

1489
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,550
And really that was not,

1490
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,590
that was not so bad actually.

1491
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,720
I though that was kind of a good part.

1492
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:34,161
But what,

1493
00:37:34,161 --> 00:37:38,010
what Iowasca will do is it will find
your own weaknesses and then use them to

1494
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:38,640
fuck with you.

1495
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,160
It's like when you're at the final
level of a video game and it's like,

1496
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:41,521
no,

1497
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:42,870
you must fight yourself.

1498
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,800
You know,

1499
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,820
like that's what it felt like.

1500
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:48,900
So it started praying on my own fears
and I heard a voice telling me exactly

1501
00:37:48,901 --> 00:37:49,740
what I was scared of,

1502
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:50,370
which is,

1503
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:50,611
you know,

1504
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:51,060
some,

1505
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,631
some illness,

1506
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:52,860
my family's had some lymphoma,

1507
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,970
my shoes or something like that.

1508
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,560
So it basically said,

1509
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,030
you're going to die of cancer,

1510
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:57,331
you know,

1511
00:37:57,331 --> 00:37:58,141
say your goodbyes,

1512
00:37:58,141 --> 00:37:58,861
you're fucking done.

1513
00:37:58,861 --> 00:37:59,251
You got it.

1514
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:00,450
Now it's bad.

1515
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:00,960
You know?

1516
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,410
And it was telling me that and that
actually started to shake me a little bit,

1517
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:04,801
you know,

1518
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:08,100
because I've never had
it work against myself,

1519
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:11,250
work against me in that kind of magnitude.

1520
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:11,581
You know,

1521
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:15,270
I've had visions of things before that
were dark and I always worked through and

1522
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,410
it,

1523
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:15,590
you know,

1524
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,440
I ended up feeling good,

1525
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:19,950
but that was a more
challenging experience in.

1526
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,540
And then at a certain point,

1527
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:21,781
you know,

1528
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:24,000
I had to just apply the
same philosophy and say,

1529
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,960
you know what,

1530
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,890
if this is the end,

1531
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,260
I'm gonna have a fucking
hell of a six months,

1532
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:28,651
you know,

1533
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:32,760
and I'm going to do everything I
can and enjoy my life and then boom,

1534
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,743
that ended.

1535
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,350
And then finally at that point I was
able to get a sense of peace and I felt

1536
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:40,420
myself getting sucked
back down into the earth.

1537
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,680
Kind of like in the,

1538
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,780
the only thing I can describe
is that movie Avatar,

1539
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,201
you know,

1540
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:48,310
in the little fibers grow up around the
body and it like connects it back down

1541
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:49,030
to the earth.

1542
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:53,680
I felt this deep relaxation just
like right back down into the earth.

1543
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,491
And then,

1544
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:55,324
um,

1545
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,050
you know,

1546
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,310
that was kind of the end.

1547
00:38:57,311 --> 00:38:59,980
That was the climax of this
first experience for me.

1548
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,460
Did you get a sense that
it was a purposeful trip?

1549
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,170
The only reason why they,

1550
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,620
it takes you on this destruction of your
body and the snakes and everything like

1551
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:09,040
that.

1552
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,370
Is it supposed to scare the fuck
out of you to break you down?

1553
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:12,820
It's,

1554
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,631
it's supposed to.

1555
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:16,450
It's a death rebirth motif
really is what it is.

1556
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:17,080
And uh,

1557
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,321
you know,

1558
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,440
that was the idea of the
medicine and the night each,

1559
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,870
each night the medicine had a theme and
the first night it was Anaconda medicine

1560
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,771
snake medicine,

1561
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:25,960
which is shedding your skin in one piece.

1562
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,370
So like a snake does it,

1563
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:28,810
snake sheds its skin all in one piece.

1564
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:31,150
This was about shedding
everything that you don't need,

1565
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:31,984
your fears,

1566
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,280
your weaknesses,

1567
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:34,114
all of that.

1568
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,320
And that's why you explore it.

1569
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:38,080
And I think part of the intent
of what the Shaman was doing,

1570
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,770
which meanwhile by the way is as we're
growing and intensity and it was like the

1571
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:43,270
room was swirling with a voice.

1572
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:43,991
You have a CD,

1573
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:44,800
like a mixed tape.

1574
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,850
I would love to see that.

1575
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:46,930
He has a youtube video,

1576
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,830
which I bought some,

1577
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:50,380
I bought some Ikaros online once,

1578
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,220
listened to it for five minutes and it
wasn't high enough and I shut her off.

1579
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,193
He has a website.

1580
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:56,650
Uh,

1581
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,190
he does,

1582
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:57,551
he does.

1583
00:39:57,551 --> 00:39:58,420
He has a youtube video.

1584
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,291
What does he have?

1585
00:39:59,291 --> 00:39:59,681
A website,

1586
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:00,514
which is website.

1587
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,301
Oh Man.

1588
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:01,620
I,

1589
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,540
I couldn't tell it was,

1590
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:03,281
it's in Spanish,

1591
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:03,491
you know,

1592
00:40:03,491 --> 00:40:05,110
so I can't recall it
on the top of my head.

1593
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,250
Maestro Orlando to [inaudible]

1594
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,071
Hospital,

1595
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:12,700

A.

1610
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,061
And it's also,

1611
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:19,391
Brian,

1612
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:20,560
if you bring it up on my blog,

1613
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:23,860
you can probably get the direct link
discovery of the eight dimension.

1614
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:24,671
Yeah,

1615
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:25,760
that's May's could journey.

1616
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:26,740
That's me.

1617
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,460
It is you.

1618
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:27,980
Yeah.

1619
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,770
Is this a video that you made?

1620
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:30,581
That was a video I made.

1621
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:31,810
I'll tell about that was my second,

1622
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:32,980
just while you were in there.

1623
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,551
Oh Dude,

1624
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:34,480
you have video?

1625
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,380
Yeah.

1626
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:35,800
Okay.

1627
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,000
Go to warrior,

1628
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,690
poet us on Youtube and
check out this video.

1629
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:41,321
That's hilarious.

1630
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:43,210
You're the number one hit on the fucking,

1631
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,380
on this guy's name.

1632
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,730
It's you and the tent
tripping your balls off.

1633
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:47,921
Yeah.

1634
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:49,090
This was the second session.

1635
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,140
You look terrified.

1636
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,533
It takes me a while.

1637
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,860
It takes me a while to get through it.

1638
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,380
Don't,

1639
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,190
don't jump to that video
til I get to the party.

1640
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:58,750
Let's talk.

1641
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,680
Let's not play that video.

1642
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,510
I want to hear all this shit.

1643
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,403
So,

1644
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:02,771
so,

1645
00:41:02,771 --> 00:41:03,340
um,

1646
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,671
so yeah,

1647
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:04,240
so that,

1648
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,420
you know,

1649
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,380
that first experience.

1650
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:06,910
So after he comes by,

1651
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:07,940
the Shaman comes by.

1652
00:41:07,941 --> 00:41:08,411
He asked me,

1653
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:09,320
I'll call my mustache.

1654
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,131
I say,

1655
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:10,960
uh,

1656
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,231
you know,

1657
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:13,690
I managed to muster
something like [inaudible].

1658
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,120
I told him I was dead.

1659
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,993
Good and dead.

1660
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,320
And he just laughed and,

1661
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,340
and kind of that was,

1662
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:19,174
I think when we,

1663
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:19,721
you know,

1664
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:23,020
he started to kind of give me a little
bit of respect because the rest of the

1665
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:24,160
room was just crushed,

1666
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:24,761
you know,

1667
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:25,100
but I,

1668
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,140
I was crushed too,

1669
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,921
but at least,

1670
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:27,161
you know,

1671
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:28,510
I was able to sit up and,

1672
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,350
and uh,

1673
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,390
and Kinda deal with it a little bit.

1674
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:31,691
So,

1675
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:32,290
um,

1676
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,360
he brings me over this
to where he's at and he,

1677
00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:36,194
uh,

1678
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,890
he starts chewing up some cinnamon and
it's the final closing ceremony in the

1679
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:43,790
cleansing ritual and he has me open
the back of my shirt and he goes,

1680
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,810
sure.

1681
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,450
With the cinnamon and
the instant he did that,

1682
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,640
it was like I was on a
bungee cord and just,

1683
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,530
and this is six hours after I'd taken it,

1684
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:51,981
you know,

1685
00:41:51,981 --> 00:41:52,370
my,

1686
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:57,370
the peak of my trip was completely done
and I just went straight up and right

1687
00:41:57,471 --> 00:42:02,060
into this world of just pure energetic
vibration that I had no idea how to

1688
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:02,810
decode.

1689
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:06,080
It was something completely
foreign to anything I've ever seen.

1690
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:07,340
What did he do with the cinnamon?

1691
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,300
So he chews it up.

1692
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,190
He's like cinnamon six dried cinnamon,

1693
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:10,910
right.

1694
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,560
And then he blows his breath.

1695
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:13,394
He goes sure.

1696
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:14,270
And forums,

1697
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,280
like a little sonic missile thing.

1698
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,360
And he put the points that at different
parts of your different parts of it,

1699
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,600
like the back of your neck,

1700
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,590
the top of your head.

1701
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,260
So he did it four times
and each time he did it,

1702
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:27,860
I had like 10 seconds swimming
in this world that just,

1703
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,140
I had no possible chance that decode.

1704
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:31,790
And it was unbelievable.

1705
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:32,061
I was like,

1706
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:33,410
what the hell is this?

1707
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:34,250
Where am I?

1708
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:34,730
You know,

1709
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,870
how do I understand it?

1710
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,830
What does it mean?

1711
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:37,371
You know,

1712
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:38,330
like the youtube video.

1713
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:41,990
But it was wild on that
closing part of the ceremony.

1714
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,010
So what did,

1715
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:45,060
what did it mean you can't decide?

1716
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,561
You coded?

1717
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:46,490
Can you describe,

1718
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:49,730
it was like a geometrical
city of light and vibration,

1719
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,331
you know?

1720
00:42:50,331 --> 00:42:50,991
But it was like,

1721
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:52,010
it was like looking at,

1722
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,040
imagine if you didn't know anything
about computer code and you looked at the

1723
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:55,581
matrix,

1724
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:56,180
right?

1725
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,590
And all you saw were ones and zeroes.

1726
00:42:57,591 --> 00:42:57,771
Right?

1727
00:42:57,771 --> 00:42:58,191
Now we know,

1728
00:42:58,191 --> 00:42:59,330
oh that's computer code.

1729
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:00,140
It's source code.

1730
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,660
It was like that kind of
information was coming to me,

1731
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,580
but I just,

1732
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,120
you know what,

1733
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,780
that sounds like a DMT trip.

1734
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,530
Yeah.

1735
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,700
So you have a flash,

1736
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:08,810
you have a DMT flash,

1737
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:11,990
so like in deep into another
blowing cinnamon on you.

1738
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:13,160
And that's what causes that.

1739
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:13,641
Yeah,

1740
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:15,680
I dunno if the cinnamon
is just to make the,

1741
00:43:15,681 --> 00:43:16,160
his blood,

1742
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,370
his breath pleasant and it's as intent
or whether it actually has some part of

1743
00:43:19,371 --> 00:43:23,180
it or distract you while some guy has a
needle in the back of your neck and just

1744
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,370
jam oily.

1745
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,730
Lobotomizing no,

1746
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:26,390
but it was,

1747
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:26,600
you know,

1748
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,940
whatever he did in that
closing part of it,

1749
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:29,240
it,

1750
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,730
I felt like it opened a
breach in something else.

1751
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:33,470
A different place for 10 seconds,

1752
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,131
for 10 seconds,

1753
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:36,050
then suck back as soon
as soon as that was over,

1754
00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:37,040
I was right back.

1755
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,370
You know,

1756
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:37,970
wouldn't laugh.

1757
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:38,211
Okay.

1758
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:39,580
So this is day one they want,

1759
00:43:39,581 --> 00:43:42,410
so then do you get up in the morning?

1760
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,490
Do you go to bed?

1761
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,150
Go to bed?

1762
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,360
Yeah,

1763
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,560
show off to Puke.

1764
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:45,921
Yeah,

1765
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:46,090
yeah,

1766
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:46,281
yeah.

1767
00:43:46,281 --> 00:43:46,971
So I went,

1768
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:47,630
you know,

1769
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,830
took care of everything in the,

1770
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:49,370
in the,

1771
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:49,811
in the dark,

1772
00:43:49,811 --> 00:43:51,200
in my hot and the dark.

1773
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:51,730
Yeah.

1774
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:52,640
It cold and dark.

1775
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,410
There's no light at all.

1776
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,000
No light at no candles are using our
phones and flashlights and they have the

1777
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:00,140
charger for your phone.

1778
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,060
Um,

1779
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,910
three hours a day.

1780
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,960
You can charge it for three hours a day.

1781
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,550
Yeah.

1782
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,520
So you're using your phone,

1783
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:05,760
you know,

1784
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,480
getting service.

1785
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,700
So it's just a flashlight,

1786
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:08,331
a little flashlight,

1787
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:09,290
expensive iPhone,

1788
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:09,920
flashlight.

1789
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,251
All right,

1790
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:12,260
so you wash yourself off.

1791
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:12,530
Yeah.

1792
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,970
Crash out and you sleep.

1793
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,140
I did fucking freaking out while
you're sleeping and you slept good.

1794
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:18,921
I felt pretty good,

1795
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:19,160
you know,

1796
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,970
after that final thing where I was able
to relax and felt sucked back into the

1797
00:44:22,971 --> 00:44:23,610
earth,

1798
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:24,110
um,

1799
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:24,711
I felt good.

1800
00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:24,921
You know,

1801
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:28,250
I felt like I learned the
importance of the physical realm.

1802
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:28,920
You know what I mean?

1803
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,060
See,

1804
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,740
next day breakfast is,

1805
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,100
do people apologize

1806
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,933
for throwing out money?

1807
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:33,580
Yeah.

1808
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,530
Some people were still,

1809
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:35,880
some people are still pretty,

1810
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:36,660
pretty shocked.

1811
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,280
Like the people in my
group were pretty shocked.

1812
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,510
A lot of them didn't go back.

1813
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,830
Some of them didn't do it again.

1814
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,031
The whole,

1815
00:44:41,031 --> 00:44:41,750
it's really,

1816
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,450
yeah.

1817
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:42,991
I mean they,

1818
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:43,560
they weren't,

1819
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,220
they fought it.

1820
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,390
They fought the whole time.

1821
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,740
And if you fight the whole time,

1822
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:48,360
you never release from it.

1823
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:48,631
You know,

1824
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:49,590
you don't work through it.

1825
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:53,730
It's like you get brought to the heat of
the battle and then you just ignore it

1826
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:55,620
and shut your eyes and it goes away.

1827
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:56,610
But it sticks with you.

1828
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,210
And that's,

1829
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,043
that's one thing that,

1830
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:58,860
you know,

1831
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,760
a caution for doing any
kind of psychedelic work is
you've got to work through

1832
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:03,594
it.

1833
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,640
So for her it was a very,

1834
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,190
she just had very repetitive visions.

1835
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:08,780
Um,

1836
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,000
you know,

1837
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,620
I was surprised that it
didn't take her deeper,

1838
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:12,870
but she was working with
some of the lighter,

1839
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,180
lighter doses in the lighter schamens.

1840
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:15,841
Um,

1841
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:17,130
and they could tell that she was,

1842
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,480
the way that they dose.

1843
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:19,350
He was pretty smart.

1844
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:21,120
Usually they try and dose you to what,

1845
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:21,461
you know,

1846
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:22,560
what they think you can handle.

1847
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:23,311
So,

1848
00:45:23,311 --> 00:45:24,020
but she was great.

1849
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:24,320
She's,

1850
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,590
it seems to me that just jumping right
into an IOWASCA trip without any previous

1851
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:32,430
psychedelic experiences like taking no
martial arts classes and fighting in the

1852
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:33,264
UFC,

1853
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,160
it just seems ridiculous.

1854
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,510
I wouldn't,

1855
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:40,290
you want to build your way up slowly
and smoke some Salvia eat a Brownie,

1856
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,310
you know,

1857
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,440
slowly legs into the river.

1858
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:45,720
That is the second dog
experience cause the,

1859
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,080
the Iowasca experience in DMT experiences
is supposed to be the two most

1860
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:51,990
powerful that you can
never have back to back.

1861
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,043
You know,

1862
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,270
one being a bit more on the spiritual
side of the Iowasca that's supposedly

1863
00:45:57,271 --> 00:46:02,271
because it's longer and not as intense
that it sort of connects you in a way

1864
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:05,700
that you can interpret
better than the DMT flash.

1865
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,150
Yeah,

1866
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:11,150
the DMT flash a lot of times just
so mind bogglingly alien that it's,

1867
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,230
there's no words for it.

1868
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:14,910
You come back with a lot of confusion.

1869
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:16,830
Like there's some message in it somewhere,

1870
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,180
but it takes a while to decode.

1871
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:20,270
I talked to them about
smoking DMT as well.

1872
00:46:20,271 --> 00:46:21,320
And I'll get to that when I get,

1873
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:24,830
I kind of have to set up kind of the
paradigm first and then I'll tell you what

1874
00:46:24,831 --> 00:46:27,350
they said about smoking
DMT versus taking ios.

1875
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,250
So did you go right
back in the second day?

1876
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:29,841
Second day,

1877
00:46:29,841 --> 00:46:30,140
no.

1878
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,850
Second day I just rested,

1879
00:46:31,851 --> 00:46:32,780
wrote in my journal,

1880
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,550
made sure to kind of digest the,

1881
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:35,090
you know,

1882
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:35,811
what I had gone through.

1883
00:46:35,811 --> 00:46:37,820
It's very energetically taxing,

1884
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:39,260
but I felt fucking great.

1885
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,030
Like I felt reborn,

1886
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:41,870
like energetic.

1887
00:46:41,871 --> 00:46:44,000
I slept five hours and I was just pumped.

1888
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:48,620
Like I got a good workout in and I felt
more alive than I have been in a long

1889
00:46:48,621 --> 00:46:48,891
time.

1890
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:49,580
It was rad.

1891
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,140
Like I felt my body felt great,

1892
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,160
my mind felt great,

1893
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,390
my spirit felt great.

1894
00:46:53,391 --> 00:46:55,550
I felt like I learned some
valuable lessons about,

1895
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:56,390
you know,

1896
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,780
the d importance of the physical realm
and I feel like I conquered some deep

1897
00:46:59,781 --> 00:47:02,540
fears about cancer and
shit that was going on.

1898
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:05,600
Like it was it like I'm not
worried about that anymore.

1899
00:47:05,601 --> 00:47:07,580
Like it took me there to overcome it.

1900
00:47:07,581 --> 00:47:08,361
And you know,

1901
00:47:08,361 --> 00:47:10,220
really that first night for me was,

1902
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:10,551
you know,

1903
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:10,631
I,

1904
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:11,660
I call it my death.

1905
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,050
It was like the old parts
of me that night died,

1906
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:15,650
you know,

1907
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:16,580
anything week,

1908
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:16,970
uh,

1909
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,650
was killed off by the IOWASCA.

1910
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,000
But it's funny you said that,

1911
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:20,290
you know,

1912
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,820
the UFC analogy I wrote in my blog,

1913
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:23,480
it was like,

1914
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,550
it was like I was kind of
with a bunch of karate,

1915
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,200
black belts and you know,

1916
00:47:27,201 --> 00:47:29,500
they took Iowasca and
just got punched the face.

1917
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:30,011
I was like,

1918
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:32,020
why the hell is going on here?

1919
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:32,651
You know?

1920
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:33,484
And they didn't really,

1921
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,510
they had the training,

1922
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,310
but it's different when
you're in a street fight,

1923
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:36,851
you know?

1924
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:37,684
And that's uh,

1925
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:38,770
that's kind of what it was.

1926
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:39,670
I didn't have the training,

1927
00:47:39,671 --> 00:47:41,680
but I've been in a few brawls in my day.

1928
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:44,890
So I think that that ends up
being a bit more important,

1929
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:45,820
um,

1930
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,860
as far as being able to
handle the experience.

1931
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:48,490
But then,

1932
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,731
you know,

1933
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:49,451
at another point,

1934
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:50,284
the second night,

1935
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:54,580
I wish I did have some of their training
cause I got an opportunity to do some

1936
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:55,150
cool shit.

1937
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:56,110
But I just didn't know what to do.

1938
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:57,320
So without that,

1939
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,500
so that's the second
session I go up to them.

1940
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:00,670
This is the third day,

1941
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:02,710
slightly more comfortable room.

1942
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,730
Um,

1943
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,230
the people who from the first session,

1944
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:06,340
a lot of them ducked out,

1945
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:06,730
you know,

1946
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,130
but there was new people who
like wanted a strong experience.

1947
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:11,290
So his legend started
to spread in the camp.

1948
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,640
So we had a few more people,

1949
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:13,474
probably 15.

1950
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,320
Um,

1951
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,120
and I went up to him
beforehand and I said,

1952
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:16,391
you know,

1953
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:18,250
my stress at a medicine,

1954
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:19,080
a flat Earth Day,

1955
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,000
like exercise,

1956
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:23,320
like I wanted a strong dose and he looks
at me and he smiled and he remembered

1957
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:24,970
that I handled the last one pretty well.

1958
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:26,860
So when it was my turn to go up,

1959
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:28,460
you fills the cup to the brim,

1960
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,600
like to the Brim and uh,

1961
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:30,880
you know,

1962
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,530
look at it and set my intent.

1963
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,930
My intent was to see how far I could go.

1964
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,370
Like I wanted to go back to that place.

1965
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:40,330
He showed me at the end of the session
and I wanted to experience joy and

1966
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,730
happiness and that side
of life the opposite side.

1967
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,170
And just see where it could take me.

1968
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,630
And that was really my goal in doing that.

1969
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:50,050
And I picked up some tips from some of
the other shamans about how to set kind

1970
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:54,530
of your own spiritual armor and kind
of prevent things from interfering and

1971
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,750
taking you off your intent.

1972
00:48:55,751 --> 00:48:56,321
So I was like,

1973
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:57,190
I felt well equipped,

1974
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,050
drank the full cup three gulps,

1975
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,190
pretty brutal again.

1976
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:01,421
And then,

1977
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:02,170
uh,

1978
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,450
then it starts and it starts,

1979
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:04,750
you know,

1980
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,730
kind of similarly as usual.

1981
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:07,450
Um,

1982
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:07,751
you know,

1983
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:09,340
an hour in visions,

1984
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:10,270
things that I remember,

1985
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:10,481
you know,

1986
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:11,320
kind of like a psych,

1987
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,550
most psychedelic trips are like,

1988
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:12,821
ah,

1989
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:13,780
I got to remember that.

1990
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,620
That's a good lesson,

1991
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:14,980
you know,

1992
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,140
take little gems from the visions you see,

1993
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:17,974
things like that.

1994
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:18,491
Uh,

1995
00:49:18,491 --> 00:49:21,940
at some point some eels came out of the
water and they started coming after me

1996
00:49:21,941 --> 00:49:25,300
and it was much like the snakes
and I looked at the eels and,

1997
00:49:25,301 --> 00:49:25,530
uh,

1998
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:25,920
I,

1999
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,180
you know,

2000
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,570
was able to kind of mentally
stop them with the armor,

2001
00:49:28,571 --> 00:49:29,500
which was a trick,

2002
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:29,771
you know,

2003
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:30,540
opening your winner.

2004
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,390
Coccia it's called.

2005
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:32,523
Um,

2006
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:33,011
and I was like,

2007
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:33,161
oh,

2008
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:33,521
sweet.

2009
00:49:33,521 --> 00:49:34,354
They stopped.

2010
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:34,901
And I was like,

2011
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:35,301
what's up?

2012
00:49:35,301 --> 00:49:37,660
He feels like this is not
the day for killing me.

2013
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:41,440
And I just told them that and they
like looked at me and they're like,

2014
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:41,981
yeah,

2015
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:42,221
okay,

2016
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:43,840
I'll believe you and just bounced.

2017
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:44,321
And I was like,

2018
00:49:44,321 --> 00:49:45,154
sweet,

2019
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,390
I'm not going to die today.

2020
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,350
Like that's awesome.

2021
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:49,180
They leave and what
does it leave you with?

2022
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,200
Well then where are you?

2023
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:50,331
Yeah.

2024
00:49:50,331 --> 00:49:53,440
So then from there then from there things,

2025
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:54,490
um,

2026
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:55,323
things got,

2027
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,580
that's when things got
started to get crazy.

2028
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:02,680
Like immediately the sensation of my
head just peeling off the top of my head

2029
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:03,400
happens.

2030
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:03,881
And Joe,

2031
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:06,370
I've been in fucking a lot of
situations and done some shit.

2032
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,151
Nothing,

2033
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:07,511
nothing,

2034
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:09,700
nothing could compare to how this felt.

2035
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,820
It felt like every cell in neuron in my
brain was completely sinked in perfect

2036
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:17,230
alignment and glowing radioactive.

2037
00:50:17,231 --> 00:50:18,910
And I had no top of my head on,

2038
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,250
it was like wall wall.

2039
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:26,310
I mean it was on real as foreign to me
as any sensation and it was a physical

2040
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:27,321
sensation.

2041
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:28,580
It wasn't a mental sensation.

2042
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:33,730
I could physically feel my brain like
alive from back from my brainstem all the

2043
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:34,970
way to the frontal lobe,

2044
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:37,160
like every part of it was full.

2045
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:38,283
And I was like,

2046
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:38,841
Whoa,

2047
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:39,320
Shit.

2048
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,580
Like something's happening here.

2049
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:41,503
Like this is new,

2050
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,020
this is a new ball game.

2051
00:50:43,021 --> 00:50:43,120
Right.

2052
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,150
And what happened from them?

2053
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,013
So from then,

2054
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:45,863
um,

2055
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,540
right after that happened,

2056
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,493
um,

2057
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,400
you know,

2058
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,280
I started to feel really fucking good,

2059
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,110
like really good and,

2060
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:58,070
and I was looking around the room and
people were vomiting and lots of chaos.

2061
00:50:58,071 --> 00:50:59,150
It started around the room,

2062
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,810
but I felt it all is like a
kind of like just a cleanse,

2063
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:02,961
you know,

2064
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:04,340
like I had a different perspective on it.

2065
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:09,020
So each one would bring me more like
happiness until finally it reached this

2066
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:10,070
ecstatic state,

2067
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,130
which was about 10 minutes of just pure,

2068
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,750
straight ecstasy.

2069
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:19,310
Like every cell of my body felt
better than it ever had before.

2070
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:24,340
It was like the exact reason why we're
given physical forms was do experience

2071
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:25,760
some kind of pleasure like this.

2072
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,990
The only thing I compare it to.

2073
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:28,220
And every time I make this analogy,

2074
00:51:28,221 --> 00:51:29,630
people ask if I nodded my pants,

2075
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:30,464
which I didn't,

2076
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:35,590
but it felt like that moment of orgasm
stretched for like five minutes,

2077
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:36,290
10 minutes.

2078
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,610
Like I didn't know where that a yell.

2079
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,320
It was like so crazy,

2080
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:42,350
intensely bodily good to feel that.

2081
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:43,550
And then,

2082
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:43,761
you know,

2083
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:45,500
so experience that and that was rad.

2084
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:46,334
I was like,

2085
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:46,910
you know,

2086
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:48,110
that would have been enough right there.

2087
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:50,240
But then it just continued to build.

2088
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:55,241
And so what happened next is this giant
organic flotilla of like snakes and

2089
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:56,870
feathers comes like a China.

2090
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,380
Kind of like an organic mothership
comes and it hovers over my head.

2091
00:52:00,381 --> 00:52:00,800
And these,

2092
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,510
this is full open eyed visuals,

2093
00:52:02,511 --> 00:52:03,140
right?

2094
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:03,973
How big is this?

2095
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,240
Oh man,

2096
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,420
it was probably 30 yards.

2097
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:09,254
40 yards.

2098
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:10,760
Big 30 yards.

2099
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:11,001
Yeah,

2100
00:52:11,001 --> 00:52:11,630
it was big.

2101
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,120
It was a massive things.

2102
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,300
Feathers and snake,

2103
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,190
Heather's and snakes and it's living,

2104
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:16,821
it's a living,

2105
00:52:16,821 --> 00:52:18,470
it's like a living mothership.

2106
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,220
Right.

2107
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,880
And it starts sucking black smoke out
of my body and I see it coming out and I

2108
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:23,150
was like,

2109
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:26,300
oh well I guess I guess
I didn't need that.

2110
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:26,930
I was like,

2111
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:27,321
okay,

2112
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:27,801
take it,

2113
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:28,041
you know,

2114
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:29,030
like cool.

2115
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:33,050
And it didn't have any physical sensation
but I could see it like coming out of

2116
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:33,411
my body.

2117
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:34,430
It came out of my throat,

2118
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:35,600
came out of my head,

2119
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,410
came out of,

2120
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:37,040
you know,

2121
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,671
different parts.

2122
00:52:37,671 --> 00:52:38,990
I guess you could correspond them to the,

2123
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,550
to the shockers where
they were coming out,

2124
00:52:40,551 --> 00:52:42,140
but just peeling out of my body.

2125
00:52:42,141 --> 00:52:42,471
I was like,

2126
00:52:42,471 --> 00:52:43,304
Whoa,

2127
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:44,143
that's pretty cool.

2128
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,970
And then it just floats off when
the smoke started to die off.

2129
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,980
And then right on its heels,

2130
00:52:48,981 --> 00:52:53,330
another mothership comes and
this mothership is metallic
and it has all kinds of

2131
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:55,070
crazy cryptic riding on it.

2132
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,270
Like stargate,

2133
00:52:56,271 --> 00:52:57,650
Sgi type of writing.

2134
00:52:57,651 --> 00:52:58,640
It's the only thing I can compare.

2135
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:03,641
Your eyes are open when you
fully and how does it look real?

2136
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,330
Can you see through it?

2137
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,860
Does it look like in an illusion?

2138
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:08,571
No,

2139
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:09,381
you can't see through it.

2140
00:53:09,381 --> 00:53:09,770
You couldn't,

2141
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,600
I couldn't see anything else really,

2142
00:53:11,601 --> 00:53:12,141
honestly.

2143
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:12,291
I,

2144
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:12,680
it was,

2145
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,820
it was black around it.

2146
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:14,090
I,

2147
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,720
my memory of it is that I could
just see that and that was it.

2148
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:20,480
I think if I tried to like focus back on,

2149
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:20,931
you know,

2150
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:21,860
my own reality,

2151
00:53:21,861 --> 00:53:23,270
I could see some shit in the room,

2152
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:24,980
but then that's all I could,

2153
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,960
it was black and it was
a ship and that was,

2154
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,430
that was the only thing I was focused on.

2155
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,700
So it looked like an alien
spacecraft stay staff fully.

2156
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:33,120
Yeah,

2157
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,481
exactly.

2158
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:33,700
Yeah.

2159
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,020
No,

2160
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:34,860
very much like that.

2161
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:38,760
Very much like this shit not quite that
big and there's writing on it something,

2162
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,080
it wasn't just smooth,

2163
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:40,621
you know what I mean?

2164
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:42,420
It wasn't like a smooth thing.

2165
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:45,390
It was either writing
or a very cool design.

2166
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:46,140
I Dunno.

2167
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,960
I mean I had no hope
to read it or anything,

2168
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,340
but so then it,

2169
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,370
and then it starts shooting this light
at me and this was one of the craziest

2170
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:53,670
things.

2171
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:54,120
Like,

2172
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,590
as soon as the light comes,

2173
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,890
I like lift my head up like this and open,

2174
00:53:58,980 --> 00:53:59,410
open,

2175
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:00,270
like put the,

2176
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,080
put my tongue on the roof of my mouth
and the light starts coming in underneath

2177
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:04,914
my Tom.

2178
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,210
I don't know why I did.

2179
00:54:06,211 --> 00:54:08,190
I have no fucking clue why I did that.

2180
00:54:08,191 --> 00:54:10,350
But I did it and that's
what I needed to do.

2181
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,670
And I was just started doing it.

2182
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,650
I was like breathing in this light.

2183
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,940
It was like I was getting uploaded
some kind of information again,

2184
00:54:17,941 --> 00:54:19,290
no physical sensation,

2185
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:20,723
but I'm just,

2186
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:22,441
you know,

2187
00:54:22,441 --> 00:54:23,640
just breathing in,

2188
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,940
breathing in this white light
that's being uploaded into me.

2189
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,680
And then I was like,

2190
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:29,040
whoa,

2191
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,360
this is fucking crazy.

2192
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:30,661
You know?

2193
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:34,600
And I couldn't believe that I knew that
that was what I was supposed to do and,

2194
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,453
but I just did it.

2195
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,290
And then the light stops,

2196
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:37,621
boom,

2197
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:39,390
retracts ship goes away.

2198
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,890
And then that,

2199
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,030
at that point,

2200
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,750
everything just blew out like the,

2201
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:46,680
I saw the room again and
then the room just goes,

2202
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:51,600
blows out into infinity and just
complete infinity around me.

2203
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,520
Now there's a couple things in infinity.

2204
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:56,130
There's the Shaman who's like
jutted out on a precipice,

2205
00:54:56,131 --> 00:54:57,930
who's going pretty hard
with his he cross now.

2206
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:58,890
Um,

2207
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,300
and then there's like some terraform.

2208
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,193
It wasn't Halloween.

2209
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:02,703
Oh Man,

2210
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:04,500
if you listened to his video,

2211
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:04,950
he's,

2212
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:06,120
he sings it a little bit.

2213
00:55:06,121 --> 00:55:07,760
But I wish I could get you something.

2214
00:55:07,761 --> 00:55:08,460
But it's

2215
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,030
knee Jeannine and 18 nae nae,

2216
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:13,490
nae,

2217
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,390
Nae,

2218
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:15,480
Nae Nae.

2219
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,380
Now the other words or is it just
knows and sometimes there is some,

2220
00:55:19,381 --> 00:55:22,170
it's like I lost.

2221
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:23,300
I mean,

2222
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:23,611
you know,

2223
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,110
sometimes those things
and things like that.

2224
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,420
So that's kind of a flight.

2225
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:29,670
Ravi said I have a terrible voice.

2226
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,930
He didn't have a great voice either,

2227
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:32,160
but it was powerful.

2228
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:32,641
You know what I mean?

2229
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:33,750
It's not like he was a singer,

2230
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,920
it was just coming out and he was
shaking is shaking his leaves.

2231
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:39,600
But he's jotted up on this precipice.

2232
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,850
And that was at three
o'clock in my line of vision,

2233
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:46,980
nine o'clock there some kind of terra
forma and kind of universal stars and,

2234
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:48,240
but it was like boom,

2235
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:49,200
like everything,

2236
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,120
everything else was completely gone.

2237
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:54,360
Everything else I could see kind
of vague outlines and white light.

2238
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,830
You just got a software update.

2239
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,310
Yeah,

2240
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:56,940
for sure.

2241
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:57,960
But this is the fucking,

2242
00:55:57,961 --> 00:55:59,520
this is another crazy factor.

2243
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,710
I would turn my head to the left,

2244
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:01,921
you know,

2245
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:05,940
turned my head 90 degrees and
still the Shamans at three o'clock,

2246
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,440
the terraform is at nine o'clock.

2247
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,750
It did not matter which
way I turned my head.

2248
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:10,680
I could lie down,

2249
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,611
I could go left,

2250
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:12,480
I could go right.

2251
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,441
Didn't matter.

2252
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:16,410
My vision was stuck in the same spot.

2253
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:21,330
It's like any movements I made in the
third dimension had absolutely no impact

2254
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,560
of what I was seeing
in the eight dimension.

2255
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,660
Like I guess if I wanted to
look around in that dimension,

2256
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,010
why is it the eighth time?

2257
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:27,761
So I'll get to that.

2258
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:28,390
Sorry about that.

2259
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:28,931
But that's,

2260
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:29,440
that's,

2261
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,400
that was what I encountered in,

2262
00:56:31,401 --> 00:56:31,720
so that's,

2263
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,600
that's the paradigm they
used at the end of it.

2264
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:35,463
They call,

2265
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,040
you know,

2266
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,780
they call where I was at that point,

2267
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:38,520
the eighth dimension.

2268
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:38,691
And,

2269
00:56:38,691 --> 00:56:40,000
and the reason why is,

2270
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,050
um,

2271
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:42,940
that's the penultimate dimension.

2272
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,440
That's the last one before the ninth,

2273
00:56:44,441 --> 00:56:46,360
which is oneness with all creation,

2274
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,253
which is just,

2275
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,070
you know,

2276
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,160
unification with,

2277
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:49,991
with all life,

2278
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,280
all creation that ever was,

2279
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:54,550
that ever will be pure solidarity with,

2280
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:54,730
uh,

2281
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:55,090
with,

2282
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:55,631
with God,

2283
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:56,141
with the universe,

2284
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:56,340
whatever.

2285
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:59,520
Is that supposed to be what you're hitting
when he blows the cinnamon smoke now.

2286
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:02,370
So that was actually the seventh
dimension is what they were going,

2287
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:03,690
but to go back to where I,

2288
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:04,350
where I was,

2289
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:04,921
where I was there,

2290
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,760
and I'll explain that
the paradigm as they see,

2291
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:09,680
they give you a map of each
question they do afterwards,

2292
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:11,010
tourists good afterwards.

2293
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:11,701
So,

2294
00:57:11,701 --> 00:57:12,330
um,

2295
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:12,751
so yeah,

2296
00:57:12,751 --> 00:57:13,500
so at that,

2297
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,011
at that point,

2298
00:57:14,011 --> 00:57:15,090
no visions were coming.

2299
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:18,060
Nothing was happening to me at
all and I was completely lucid.

2300
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:18,930
So I was like,

2301
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:19,410
all right,

2302
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:20,243
what can I do?

2303
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:21,301
And I was thinking like,

2304
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:21,481
well,

2305
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:22,231
what would I want to do?

2306
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:22,501
I was like,

2307
00:57:22,501 --> 00:57:23,190
well,

2308
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,870
I got a friend who got in a car wreck.

2309
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,261
I was like,

2310
00:57:25,261 --> 00:57:27,090
I wonder how he's doing
and he's in Atlanta.

2311
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:28,283
And so I was like,

2312
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,070
wonder how he's doing?

2313
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:29,520
Boom.

2314
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,220
I see him and he's in like a
bar or restaurant and I'm like,

2315
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,083
Oh snap.

2316
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,470
Like he just came immediately.

2317
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,820
It didn't have to travel.

2318
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,110
Like I could see it right there.

2319
00:57:37,111 --> 00:57:37,670
And he's laughing,

2320
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:38,503
talking with friends.

2321
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:39,420
I was like,

2322
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,560
well it looks like he's okay,

2323
00:57:40,561 --> 00:57:41,610
but I wonder if he really is.

2324
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,320
And I was able to like look in his
body and I see this like bad energetic,

2325
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:49,710
something like this black
part of in his rib cage.

2326
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:50,880
And I was like,

2327
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,380
oh that's,

2328
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,213
that's no good.

2329
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,040
And I was like,

2330
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,210
I wonder if I can get rid of that.

2331
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:55,403
And I was like,

2332
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,230
then I focused on pushing like white,

2333
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,870
that golden light into
his body and I was like,

2334
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:04,380
Bill's his body and pushes this
little missile out of his ribs.

2335
00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:05,010
And I was like,

2336
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,030
Oh shit.

2337
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:08,100
Like I don't know if that
actually helped them,

2338
00:58:08,101 --> 00:58:09,870
but that was pretty rad
that I was able to do it.

2339
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:10,260
You know?

2340
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,690
I didn't know I got to
call him up afterwards.

2341
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:13,561
I couldn't call.

2342
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:14,041
There's no,

2343
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,690
there's no cell phone
talking to him later.

2344
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:16,861
I talked to him later.

2345
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:19,140
He doesn't remember like the exact moment,

2346
00:58:19,141 --> 00:58:20,430
but he said right around then.

2347
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:20,811
Yeah,

2348
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:22,380
he started feeling way better,

2349
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,101
you know,

2350
00:58:23,101 --> 00:58:23,934
so,

2351
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,300
um,

2352
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:24,870
I don't know.

2353
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,120
Then before that I just,

2354
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,431
you know,

2355
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,701
he had,

2356
00:58:26,701 --> 00:58:27,600
he had a bad impact,

2357
00:58:27,601 --> 00:58:29,520
got t bone with some lady coming off the,

2358
00:58:29,521 --> 00:58:30,331
off the freeway,

2359
00:58:30,331 --> 00:58:31,350
hit the steering wheel,

2360
00:58:31,351 --> 00:58:31,880
hit his head.

2361
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,030
So he felt better out of nowhere.

2362
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,140
Did you ask him,

2363
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:36,621
hey man,

2364
00:58:36,621 --> 00:58:38,720
do you ever been in a bar and then
all of a sudden you feel better?

2365
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:39,621
Or did you say,

2366
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:39,921
Hey,

2367
00:58:39,921 --> 00:58:42,050
I did some food freaky Voodoo on you?

2368
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:45,150
Did you put the power of
suggestion and it's fine when you,

2369
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:45,780
sadly,

2370
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,770
next time I talked to him,

2371
00:58:46,771 --> 00:58:48,300
I was fucking hammered.

2372
00:58:48,301 --> 00:58:50,140
So I think we just got right into it.

2373
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:53,010
It wasn't like you got
to dance around that one.

2374
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,540
Find out the real evidence.

2375
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:54,781
I know.

2376
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,120
No.

2377
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:55,481
So,

2378
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:55,900
um,

2379
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,620
next time,

2380
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,550
next time I'll do that.

2381
00:58:57,551 --> 00:58:57,941
But we,

2382
00:58:57,941 --> 00:58:58,151
you know,

2383
00:58:58,151 --> 00:59:00,100
he just breezed into town and I was like,

2384
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:00,611
Yo,

2385
00:59:00,611 --> 00:59:01,990
I'm just back from Peru.

2386
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:02,680
Um,

2387
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,111
but anyway,

2388
00:59:03,111 --> 00:59:03,340
so,

2389
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,830
so I didn't get the proper
scientific explanation,

2390
00:59:05,831 --> 00:59:08,350
but some loose correlation
with how it works.

2391
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:08,980
Okay.

2392
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,530
But more concrete evidence on myself.

2393
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,160
Um,

2394
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:12,551
I was like,

2395
00:59:12,551 --> 00:59:12,761
all right,

2396
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:13,840
well if I do that to him,

2397
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:14,674
what about myself?

2398
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,020
And I started scanning my body with my,

2399
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:21,560
with my hands and my mind and it was
like a car mechanic looking at the car,

2400
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:23,330
like I was completely
detached from and I was like,

2401
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,530
oh that's pretty good.

2402
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:26,000
Like I did a pretty good job here.

2403
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:26,870
Like that's not bad.

2404
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:28,070
Like this vessel is pretty good.

2405
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:31,260
And I was just giving it like a
10 point inspection and you know,

2406
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,780
my glands that have always been swollen,

2407
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:33,110
I was like,

2408
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:33,411
ah,

2409
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:35,330
there's something not quite right there.

2410
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:39,920
So I like went and I like physically
like started pulling out of out of my

2411
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:40,261
glands.

2412
00:59:40,261 --> 00:59:40,491
It was like,

2413
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:42,440
well maybe I can pull
what's bad out of there.

2414
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,880
And I felt like I did and I felt like
it stuck to my fingers and my shaking my

2415
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:47,360
fingers like,

2416
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:47,720
ah,

2417
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,261
get it off.

2418
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:49,190
I didn't know how to get it off.

2419
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:53,630
So I like shake it and some of it falls
off and then I put it in the ground and

2420
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:54,750
some of it like drips off.

2421
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:55,161
And then I was like,

2422
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:55,281
oh,

2423
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:56,210
it's still not working.

2424
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,780
So I had a water then and I poured it
on my fingers and that seemed to work.

2425
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:00,710
Um,

2426
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:01,100
you know,

2427
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:01,641
who knows,

2428
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:02,391
who knows about that.

2429
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,700
But since then I haven't gotten,

2430
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,080
my glands have not been swollen at all
and I've gotten like Epstein Barr virus

2431
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:11,360
that always like has him
a little bit swollen,

2432
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,400
but not even a bit since then.

2433
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:14,600
So I dunno

2434
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:14,911
now.

2435
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:15,210
Whoa,

2436
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:18,140
thank God you weren't just ripping
your face off at that time by the way.

2437
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:19,850
Oh,

2438
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,090
I was so lucid,

2439
01:00:21,091 --> 01:00:22,250
like anything I thought.

2440
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:22,831
And then I was like,

2441
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:23,820
well what am I listening to?

2442
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:24,654
What you just said?

2443
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:28,560
You said I was so lucid my glands out.

2444
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:28,731
Yeah,

2445
01:00:28,731 --> 01:00:29,720
I was ripping my glands.

2446
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,050
Now we're dirt.

2447
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:31,591
It's weird,

2448
01:00:31,591 --> 01:00:32,280
right?

2449
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,780
Shooting long missiles out of
your friend when you hear us

2450
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,020
dump like this,

2451
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,880
you know when you hear yourself say it,

2452
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,170
who's phone is that?

2453
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:42,330
Someone's got their phone
right next to the thing

2454
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:45,860
anyway.

2455
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:46,590
You hear that shit,

2456
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:48,360
that feedback that's a
phone next to something.

2457
01:00:48,361 --> 01:00:48,720
Anyway.

2458
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,410
Um,

2459
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:49,800
when,

2460
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,980
when you hear yourself saying this
knee's hear yourself describing it,

2461
01:00:52,981 --> 01:00:54,390
it's surely part of,

2462
01:00:54,391 --> 01:00:57,720
you must think how
preposterous and ridiculous.

2463
01:00:57,721 --> 01:00:59,460
This must sound to a skeptical person.

2464
01:00:59,480 --> 01:00:59,850
Sure.

2465
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:00,061
Like,

2466
01:01:00,061 --> 01:01:00,421
you know,

2467
01:01:00,421 --> 01:01:01,201
a skeptical,

2468
01:01:01,201 --> 01:01:01,981
no nonsense.

2469
01:01:01,981 --> 01:01:05,040
Sort of a fucking gold water Republican
listened to this Faggot Shit.

2470
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:05,640
You know,

2471
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,440
you listen to this ridiculous nonsense.

2472
01:01:07,441 --> 01:01:08,550
He's fucking pussy kids.

2473
01:01:08,551 --> 01:01:08,940
Wait,

2474
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:09,960
you want to find yourself?

2475
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:10,580
Huh?

2476
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:11,550
You want to find yourself?

2477
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:12,250
Yeah,

2478
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:12,690
go off.

2479
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,280
Not On jumbo and take drugs.

2480
01:01:14,281 --> 01:01:15,360
That's how you find yourself.

2481
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,111
I mean,

2482
01:01:16,111 --> 01:01:16,531
you must,

2483
01:01:16,531 --> 01:01:17,161
he must think,

2484
01:01:17,161 --> 01:01:18,120
I mean like listen to,

2485
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:18,631
you know,

2486
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:19,464
this is like,

2487
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:22,860
this is like the main thing
that people would criticize.

2488
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:23,491
You know,

2489
01:01:23,491 --> 01:01:26,580
if they would hear about people
trying to find themselves with drugs.

2490
01:01:26,581 --> 01:01:26,710
Yeah.

2491
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:29,820
This fucking idiot thinks
he's pulling cancer out of it.

2492
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:30,913
Blends.

2493
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:31,281
Yeah.

2494
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:31,640
You know,

2495
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,150
you,

2496
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,871
you hear that,

2497
01:01:32,871 --> 01:01:33,704
that's crazy.

2498
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,500
But you can control your mind if you're,

2499
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:38,810
if you are what your mind believes it is,

2500
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:39,201
then he,

2501
01:01:39,201 --> 01:01:40,250
if he thinks he's a,

2502
01:01:40,251 --> 01:01:41,630
he's cleaning out his body,

2503
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,990
his brain will think he's cleaning out
his body and it might actually have

2504
01:01:44,991 --> 01:01:45,681
something to it,

2505
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:46,370
you know,

2506
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,203
like

2507
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:48,950
actually happening.

2508
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:49,400
I mean,

2509
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,900
either way more it's actually happening,

2510
01:01:50,901 --> 01:01:51,051
right?

2511
01:01:51,051 --> 01:01:51,770
I mean,

2512
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:53,540
I was there and I have to report it.

2513
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,513
Honestly,

2514
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:55,660
I feel like that's my,

2515
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:58,410
that's my mission to come back and I
feel like it's one of the reasons why it

2516
01:01:58,411 --> 01:02:00,570
happened to me so I
could talk about it and,

2517
01:02:00,571 --> 01:02:00,751
you know,

2518
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:01,950
talking to you guys and get,

2519
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:02,790
get it out there.

2520
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:04,440
But the next thing I did was,

2521
01:02:04,441 --> 01:02:04,980
um,

2522
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:09,090
was I looked at my business and very
lucidly looked at all of my marketing

2523
01:02:09,091 --> 01:02:10,260
channels and different things.

2524
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:10,920
Um,

2525
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,970
thought about Alpha brain,

2526
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,020
thought about the different things,

2527
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:13,854
thought about,

2528
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,191
you know,

2529
01:02:14,191 --> 01:02:14,970
very,

2530
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:19,970
very conservative Republican type
thinking about my life and my business.

2531
01:02:20,251 --> 01:02:23,490
And I'd saw some channels that I was
working hard to produce and I was like,

2532
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:24,750
there's no resources there.

2533
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:26,700
And I could v physically visualize,

2534
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:27,151
you know,

2535
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:30,750
where there was pools in these tubes
that were feeding like a giant machine.

2536
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:31,350
I was like,

2537
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,230
well I'm trying to build this
tube to this pool of resources,

2538
01:02:34,231 --> 01:02:35,130
but there's nothing there.

2539
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,450
Like I got to cut that one off.

2540
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:36,871
I was like,

2541
01:02:36,871 --> 01:02:38,610
this one is good but it's blocked.

2542
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:38,791
You know,

2543
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:39,690
they've got to change that,

2544
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:40,530
change the marketing,

2545
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:40,921
you know,

2546
01:02:40,921 --> 01:02:42,030
change something on that.

2547
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,170
So or you know,

2548
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,690
think about this formula or that and
I could visualize it perfectly and you

2549
01:02:47,691 --> 01:02:48,330
know,

2550
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:50,190
right now business is going great.

2551
01:02:50,191 --> 01:02:50,450
So,

2552
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:51,980
so you saw it it and metaphors.

2553
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:56,090
You saw it in a different sense
than you saw it as you know,

2554
01:02:56,091 --> 01:02:56,630
here's,

2555
01:02:56,630 --> 01:02:57,710
here's a product,

2556
01:02:57,711 --> 01:02:58,640
here's the marketing.

2557
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:02,000
Instead of that you saw it
as almost like energy or

2558
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:02,681
thank feet.

2559
01:03:02,681 --> 01:03:03,670
It was like feeding,

2560
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,620
it was like feeding a machine like gas,

2561
01:03:05,621 --> 01:03:06,270
fuel.

2562
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:06,870
Now Dj,

2563
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:07,710
do you have any idea?

2564
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,330
Did you talk to it like the other people?

2565
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:12,500
Were they also doing the same things are
where other people are like did I saw

2566
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:13,343
the dancing

2567
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,160
phone is so much louder
than everybody else's.

2568
01:03:15,161 --> 01:03:16,300
You suck on that thing,

2569
01:03:16,301 --> 01:03:16,511
dude,

2570
01:03:16,511 --> 01:03:17,800
you get up in here like this,

2571
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:19,260
back off a little bit.

2572
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:19,990
Everybody,

2573
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:20,370
everybody else

2574
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:24,570
so whereas other people like like
just like seeing dancing bears.

2575
01:03:24,571 --> 01:03:24,700
Yeah.

2576
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,533
They're like,

2577
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,553
yeah,

2578
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:31,440
they were seeing their own demons
or spirits or are different things.

2579
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,170
Did you guys have shared visions?

2580
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:33,890
No.

2581
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:34,790
No shared vision.

2582
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:35,803
No shared visits.

2583
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:40,070
That's one of the things that
when they first discovered it,

2584
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,060
the the,

2585
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,490
when they started bringing
it back to the Western world,

2586
01:03:43,491 --> 01:03:45,370
they tried to call it telepathy mean.

2587
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:46,220
Yeah,

2588
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:47,053
because?

2589
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:49,070
Because of shared experiences,

2590
01:03:49,071 --> 01:03:54,071
but because of the rules of a scientific
rules of nomenclature because the

2591
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:55,131
isolated,

2592
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,990
the compound is harming already.

2593
01:03:56,991 --> 01:04:01,010
One of the compounds they went with that
because it was the first description of

2594
01:04:01,011 --> 01:04:01,101
it,

2595
01:04:01,101 --> 01:04:04,310
but they were going to call it telepathy
dean because of the shared experiences,

2596
01:04:04,311 --> 01:04:05,810
but you didn't have any of that.

2597
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:10,400
There was some like husband and wife
couples in different huts that did that

2598
01:04:10,401 --> 01:04:11,121
we're witnessing.

2599
01:04:11,121 --> 01:04:13,430
One would just witnessed the
others entire experience.

2600
01:04:13,431 --> 01:04:15,910
It'd be like they would try and talk
to each other about it and in fact,

2601
01:04:15,911 --> 01:04:16,071
yeah,

2602
01:04:16,071 --> 01:04:17,150
I know I saw the whole thing.

2603
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,140
So that happened.

2604
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:20,270
But as far as like the
group in my setting,

2605
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:23,350
it seemed to be more closely linked to um,

2606
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,433
family,

2607
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:24,771
you know,

2608
01:04:24,771 --> 01:04:27,200
family ties or relationship,

2609
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:28,100
romantic ties,

2610
01:04:28,101 --> 01:04:28,790
things like that.

2611
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:29,870
Not necessarily what,

2612
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:33,790
so the shared experiences are with
people that already have a relationship.

2613
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,380
That's what seemed to
be happening in this.

2614
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:36,350
That makes sense.

2615
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:36,950
Yeah.

2616
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:37,191
Yeah.

2617
01:04:37,191 --> 01:04:38,450
You were already tuned in together.

2618
01:04:38,451 --> 01:04:39,231
You're already well,

2619
01:04:39,231 --> 01:04:39,501
you know,

2620
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:42,950
there's that feeling always when you're
in a relationship that you become a part

2621
01:04:42,951 --> 01:04:43,784
of that person.

2622
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:44,361
You know?

2623
01:04:44,361 --> 01:04:45,194
I mean,

2624
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:48,650
I think every deep intense
relationships that I've ever had,

2625
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:52,880
you feel like it's more than just
two people hanging out together.

2626
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:53,990
Somehow or another,

2627
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:55,700
you connect on some,

2628
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:58,250
I don't want to say spiritual energy,

2629
01:04:58,251 --> 01:05:00,170
so some sort of intangible level,

2630
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:04,550
which is why breaking up is so painful
because a part of you is literally

2631
01:05:04,551 --> 01:05:04,941
missing.

2632
01:05:04,941 --> 01:05:06,380
You cannot feel whole.

2633
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:07,550
You can't sleep,

2634
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:08,181
you can't eat,

2635
01:05:08,181 --> 01:05:10,940
you don't feel right because
some of you is missing.

2636
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:14,300
So that would kind of make sense that
those are the type of people that would

2637
01:05:14,301 --> 01:05:17,090
have a shared experience
because they literally have,

2638
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,010
their souls

2639
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,450
are somehow or another connected.

2640
01:05:19,451 --> 01:05:22,030
They have some sort of a inexorable bond.

2641
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,141
And that's,

2642
01:05:23,141 --> 01:05:23,770
and that's what,

2643
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:24,940
that's what played itself out.

2644
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,580
So you didn't have any
experiences with your mom.

2645
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:29,020
Your mom only did it once.

2646
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,130
Now she did it three times.

2647
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:30,964
She did it three times,

2648
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:31,541
three times.

2649
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:32,201
She do it with you,

2650
01:05:32,201 --> 01:05:32,751
with the Dragon.

2651
01:05:32,751 --> 01:05:35,500
And she was actually in that room
that time and she said she was,

2652
01:05:35,501 --> 01:05:36,790
she didn't see what I saw.

2653
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:37,091
I mean,

2654
01:05:37,091 --> 01:05:38,100
it wasn't because it.
