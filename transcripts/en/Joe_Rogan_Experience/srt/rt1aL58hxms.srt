Real good

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,160
experience Joe Rogan podcast.
My night.

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,250
Ladies and gentlemen,
we seriously got to fucking legends in 

17
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:07,390
the house.
This is a ridiculous late night podcast.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,190
It's 12:30
AM here.

19
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,900
Ensign.
Anyway,

20
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,520
just where'd you fly in from?
Portland,

21
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:14,800
Oregon.
Just flew in from Portland.

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,140
Staying with Chuck Liddell and both of 
them.

23
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,490
The only way to do a podcast is the 
banging out right now at 12:30

24
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,900
AM.
So here we are man.

25
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,850
Speaking into microphone.
Tell everybody what's up.

26
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,720
What's up?
Hi.

27
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,930
People have been asking for this podcast
for a long fucking time and you're 

28
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,780
wondering why you're a very unique 
character.

29
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:33,160
They want to hear you talk,
you know,

30
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:36,070
it's like you're a,
you're not just a,

31
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,090
a pioneer of mma as is chuck,
but you're also a very unique human 

32
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:46,831
being and uh,
there's a lot of stuff that you do both 

33
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:48,550
the inside of martial arts and outside 
of martial arts is very,

34
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:50,080
very admirable,
you know,

35
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:52,440
and one of the things that I really 
appreciate is a,

36
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,970
I keep seeing all this stuff that you're
doing for,

37
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:58,300
uh,
the victims of Fukushima and you've gone

38
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:00,730
down there several times,
21 times,

39
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,190
21 times.
And what are you doing when you go down 

40
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,190
there?

41
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,190
It was,
it was,

42
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,251
uh,
it was actually a change of different 

43
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:11,251
things that I did in the beginning.
We just went up there just to,

44
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,520
uh,
save people,

45
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:17,521
help people.
It was like two weeks after the tsunami 

46
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:18,730
hit and then it moved to helping the 
people in the evacuation centers.

47
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,390
And then now it's people that are placed
in temporary housing that don't have any

48
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,920
source of income.
We're just turn us,

49
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:29,590
help them,
supply them with their basic necessities

50
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,650
like water stuff like water,
toilet paper,

51
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:34,210
tissue,
dog food,

52
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:35,170
cat food.
I mean,

53
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,130
yes,
a lot of people take things for granted 

54
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:41,130
and there's so much that these people 
need,

55
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,611
you know,
and people forgetting a lot of because 

56
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:44,611
they're not news anymore.

57
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:45,620
Were you in Japan when the quake hit?
I was in Japan.

58
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,450
Yeah.
Everybody craziest earthquake.

59
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,120
Overfilled.
Yeah.

60
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,170
Just kept.
The difference was it didn't usually 

61
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,300
earthquakes last few seconds and you're 
like,

62
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,040
oh,
earthquake finish,

63
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,890
but this one gets kept going and it kept
getting stronger and we're like,

64
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,900
whoa.
I was on the phone with a friend at the 

65
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:03,900
time in Hawaii and I was like,
Oh shit,

66
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,460
this is huge.
Then shit started falling in my house,

67
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,500
in the cupboard,
my,

68
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,830
my pictures on my walls and the old 
these ships.

69
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,800
This is something I never felt before.

70
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,380
It's kind of fucked up because the 
videos of the tsunami was,

71
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,260
we've all known about tsunamis for,
you know,

72
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:20,060
hundreds of years,
if not thousands of years.

73
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:22,520
People have been aware that that happens
when the ocean goes out,

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,130
that you gotta get the fuck out of there
because something's going on,

75
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:30,131
but we've never really seen it on video.
We've never captured it the way it was 

76
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:34,751
captured in Fukushima,
it's scarier when you saw those cars 

77
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,030
rolling over the ground just going with 
the ocean and taken out houses and 

78
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,180
houses floating that were on fire and 
it's like mother nature.

79
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,570
They had it going over the rice fields 
and they had like these white of 

80
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,690
greenhouses like on it.
You've got to realize those greenhouses 

81
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:52,690
like 12 feet tall,
chaises blake,

82
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,370
little toys,
and there was a screening rate over 

83
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:57,370
everything.
It was unbelievable.

84
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,080
It was amazing to watch.
It was amazing to watch the physical 

85
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,280
devastation that,
that mother nature can bring it.

86
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:03,670
And by the way,
it's shit like that,

87
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,500
which happens every,
you know,

88
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:07,120
several hundred years.
We just,

89
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,760
we hadn't,
hadn't documented it like this,

90
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:14,761
you know,
we didn't have video cameras the last 

91
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:16,591
time it happened like this.
What was amazing though to me was not 

92
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:16,780
just that something like this would 
happen,

93
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:20,380
but how orderly everybody responded in 
Japan,

94
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,590
like you saw the lines.
Everybody was when they were waiting for

95
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:25,540
eight or when they were helping each 
other.

96
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,280
It was really pretty amazing.

97
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,360
Yeah.
It's a little different than the rest of

98
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:29,530
the room.

99
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,450
Fuck.
Yeah.

100
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,180
A lot different inner lining of food 
when they don't have food.

101
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:39,181
You know what,
what is the difference is just the 

102
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:39,190
culture of Japan

103
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,810
mannerisms and the um,
the type of,

104
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:43,650
uh,
they have this,

105
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,470
you know,
the spirit,

106
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:47,840
you know that to suck it up.
You know,

107
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,150
you see it in the fighters to in Japan.
I mean,

108
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,250
I hate to talk than Americans,
but man,

109
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,840
sometimes they go and go.
My brothers,

110
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:55,420
Jim,
and he goes,

111
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,700
you got to tell guys to do couple more 
rounds within the Japanese guys.

112
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:03,000
You got to tell them stop.
Or they'll keep going.

113
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,070
You teach them on technique to keep 
doing it.

114
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,420
I mean,
I'll do a seminar in Japan,

115
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,170
my technique,
I'll forget them.

116
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,740
When we started talking to someone,
I looked back and you're still repeating

117
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:15,741
the technique over and over,
but when I go into something in the 

118
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:16,200
states as I'll do it,
keep going,

119
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:18,130
keep going.
They do it once one is over here next to

120
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,650
move.
Keep going,

121
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:20,300
keep doing it.
You know,

122
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
doesn't tell us a little different.

123
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,530
There's a lot of lazy bitches in this 
country.

124
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,800
We got,
we got it too.

125
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,350
Good.
Everyone's fucking soft over here.

126
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,110
It's hard to find like super disciplined
people over here.

127
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,160
It is a fascinating thing when you see 
that an entire country has a different 

128
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,420
philosophy,
you know,

129
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,250
and I,
I've only been to Japan once,

130
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,620
but it was amazing.
It was really interesting.

131
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,360
It was,
and it was after the,

132
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:52,361
uh,
the earthquake and it was after 

133
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:52,361
Fukushima and everything's won.
The UFC was there.

134
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:52,490
And uh,
it's a,

135
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:55,100
it's a totally different world man.
It's pretty neat.

136
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,400
It's very neat.
You know,

137
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,790
how long you been over there now?
Twenty two years.

138
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,760
Wow.
And you were born and raised in America.

139
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,620
And why and what,
what,

140
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,820
what led you to go to Japan

141
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,620
for extra racquetball,
racquetball,

142
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:09,010
play record with.
Wow.

143
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,610
That wasn't even fighting.
I was just training because we had a lot

144
00:06:11,611 --> 00:06:14,490
of street fights in Hawaii,
so it was just training just so I didn't

145
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:18,150
get my ass kicked in Hawaii pretty much 
because we were Japanese and back in the

146
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,710
day being big was being strong.
So for me being an oriental,

147
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:25,530
we're smaller so we just had to really 
fight for our stuff.

148
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:28,710
We either had to give her a lunch money 
everyday or fight for it.

149
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,490
Hawaii is one of the last places where 
street fights go down on a fucking 

150
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,880
regular basis to happen.
So it's kind of crazy man.

151
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,280
Why is one of the rare places that are 
left on this earth where things are 

152
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,010
decided with knuckles?
You know,

153
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,230
that's,
that's real.

154
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:47,900
There's a lot of places where there's,
you know,

155
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,940
all sorts of gun violence and violence 
and I'm sure so Hawaii hasn't shared 

156
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,871
that,
but there's a lot of fucking fights 

157
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:59,391
going on in Hawaii.
It's amazing when you think about an 

158
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:02,691
island in the middle of Pacific and how 
many great fighters that come out of 

159
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:02,790
there.
It's both you and your brother,

160
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,230
Bj Penn,
you know,

161
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:06,450
and just keep naming all the way down 
the line.

162
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,560
God,
Kendall Grove and you know,

163
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,570
there's so many.
So many guys came out of Hawaii just 

164
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,750
like it has.
There's a certain style of fighter that 

165
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:17,750
comes out.

166
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,690
Hawaii,
like scrappy,

167
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,310
wild chance taken,
you know,

168
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:24,360
we're in your face.
Does not like conservative fighters from

169
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,330
Hawaii like you don't see like a lot of 
stick and move technical,

170
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:31,380
like trying to get out of there and stay
safe.

171
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,480
Let Me Bond Jackie style,
you know,

172
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:35,040
there's not a,
not a lot of that man.

173
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,660
Dudes are going after it in Hawaii.
It's true.

174
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,440
It's interesting man.
You and your brother,

175
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:43,980
I was there for your UFC debut.
I was here when you fought Royce Alger.

176
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,430
Yeah,
I was the backstage interviewer.

177
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,340
I'm pretty sure I interviewed you 
because you got injured in the fight and

178
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:52,050
you couldn't continue to interview.
Yeah,

179
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:52,560
yeah,
yeah.

180
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,820
Let me back.
I'm like,

181
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,720
what is it?
[inaudible] 97,

182
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,110
was that [inaudible] 98.
[inaudible] 97.

183
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,110
Yeah.

184
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,450
All right.
Well I remember,

185
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,590
I remember it is fueled a little weird,
but I didn't think it was hurt.

186
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:08,010
Yeah.
What happened to you and that went 

187
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,760
backstage and I felt that I got hit so I
just wanted to check on.

188
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:11,320
My nose was bleeding and that's the 
basic rule,

189
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:16,321
you know,
don't blow your nose for nose that I 

190
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:19,770
felt the air come through and push.
Almost like felt like it was going to 

191
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:19,770
push it out.
I was like,

192
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,800
Holy Shit.
What just happened

193
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,300
for,
for functional know when,

194
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,200
when a guy in a fight gets a broken 
nose,

195
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:29,201
they always tell you don't blow your 
nose because it creates some sort of 

196
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:29,330
pressure built up

197
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,210
thin plate of bone plate across the face
here.

198
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,540
That's like paper thin.
And if there's any hole in it actually 

199
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,870
holds in the air and turn your face 
pretty Freaky,

200
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:39,710
Huh?
Oh.

201
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,320
And if you have a little crack there and
you blow your nose,

202
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,550
it'll just push the Arrow through that.
So that's pretty much it for fighting,

203
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:48,460
especially for um,
kickboxers boxers.

204
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,720
I think it's a basic,
real simple,

205
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:52,460
basic root and blow your nose after your
fight.

206
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,720
It's so hard to do though,
right?

207
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,410
Because he can't breathe out of your 
nose and bloods

208
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,810
kind of just check if I like,
those is bleeding and they just blew in 

209
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:01,810
this

210
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:01,810
poof.
Like,

211
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,620
whoa.
That was a fight where Royce Alger was.

212
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Uh,
that was when Mark Coleman was on top 

213
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,080
and wrestlers like the high end Jessalyn
was Kevin Jackson and randleman was in 

214
00:09:13,421 --> 00:09:18,421
his prime and it was a lot of like high 
end wrestlers were just starting to 

215
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:18,421
enter into the game.

216
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:21,030
The wrestlers were the ones that were 
beating everybody here.

217
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,450
But I remember you,
you caught him in the arm born.

218
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,560
I think he broke his arm.
Did it pop.

219
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,790
But I remember you put your bras.
They were like,

220
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,870
they were yelling something at you guys 
and as you were leaving your brothers 

221
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,171
like,
wrestlers ain't shit like you guys like 

222
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:41,340
having,
there was some thing back and forth 

223
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:41,340
between you guys.

224
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Yeah,
yeah,

225
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:41,920
yeah.
I remember it man.

226
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:44,470
It was,
it was interesting because you uh,

227
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,750
you know,
in arm barn him,

228
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,440
it wasn't just an upset,
it was an upset,

229
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:54,100
but it was also like the,
it was like the world got to know you.

230
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,770
That was like your first big fight on 
the big stage.

231
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,680
It was Kinda good that they just blew 
up.

232
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:03,681
Royce kind of helped me out.
They made a big deal at them because 

233
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:03,681
they thought,
well here's a

234
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,030
accessible amateur wrestler.
He's probably going to be the next big 

235
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,150
thing in mma.
But it turned out that you were,

236
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,760
it's kind of shitty.
It was recording everything.

237
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:13,780
It was about race,
race,

238
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:14,260
race,
race,

239
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:14,950
race,
and even when,

240
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:20,010
the way the question is,
it's like when I fought randy the same 

241
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,010
type of question,
like,

242
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,650
are you going to be okay?
Kind of thing.

243
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,660
Like it gets mistaken.
I grabbed that.

244
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:27,780
I'm breaking like any other arm,
you know.

245
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:33,060
Did you find out randy with pants on?
Were you wearing the tights and you 

246
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,890
caught Randi with an arm as well?
Right.

247
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,010
So almost the exact same time too.
It was like right after,

248
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,690
because randy was there,
the UFC,

249
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,950
he won the heavyweight tournament.
Yeah.

250
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,400
So I,
I didn't expect that to him to,

251
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,350
for him to make that mistake.

252
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Yeah.
He fought Tony Halma and then he fought 

253
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:52,720
that big,
big black kid who had a lot of promise.

254
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,800
But after that randy five,
we never really saw him again.

255
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,170
A kid was pretty good.
But you,

256
00:10:57,171 --> 00:10:57,660
uh,
you,

257
00:10:57,661 --> 00:11:02,661
you,
you did one thing in that fight that we 

258
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:03,560
hadn't seen up until that point.
It was like in the Royce Alger fight.

259
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:08,590
It was like we were just starting to get
accustomed to what techniques were 

260
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,850
really effective in mma.
And we'd seen hoists.

261
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,810
Gracie,
of course,

262
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:16,811
Armbar a few guys,
but we hadn't seen them take on one of 

263
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:21,221
these big name wrestlers.
It was just starting to enter into the 

264
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:24,401
game.
So when you caught him with that arm 

265
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:24,401
bar,
that was a,

266
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:24,401
that was a big deal.
That was like,

267
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:24,401
oh,
okay.

268
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:29,261
Like you can't just be a wrestler.
You gotta you gotTa know what the fuck 

269
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:29,261
is going on.
When it got throws his legs up,

270
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:29,261
like

271
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:32,600
especially with the hype them up,
you still is the volunteer.

272
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,420
Well then after that fight,
the next thing that you showed those in 

273
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,151
the randy fight,
you were kicking the shit out his legs 

274
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:43,090
from like the scoop position man from 
the bottom.

275
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:48,091
Yeah.
You landed some fucking hard leg kicks 

276
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:48,160
from that position when you don't see 
that very often,

277
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,030
you know,
well this,

278
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:50,450
this,
this,

279
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,950
I just have this style that just 
aggressive matter where you're at.

280
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,420
And we,
we,

281
00:11:55,421 --> 00:12:00,421
um,
they weren't really checking the leg 

282
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:00,421
tape.
We,

283
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:03,450
we literally put a whole roll of tape on
my legs and it was pretty much 80 

284
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,991
percent of the front and they let it go 
and it was like a little castle all 

285
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:10,891
over.
The shit hurt a little more than it 

286
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:10,891
looked.

287
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:11,480
Sorry.
On the part of the game though.

288
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,880
Well,
back in those days,

289
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:15,290
you know,
like Chuck,

290
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:20,291
I've watched your fights.
I've watched some of those valley to 

291
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,360
fights where it was no knock holes in 
the bottom of the bottom of the ropes 

292
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,360
were annette,

293
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,200
that net when you get there,
the stuck underneath the net pen under 

294
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,840
hitting him,

295
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,320
hammering them through the net and blood
dripping and I was dosed ivc days in 

296
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,770
Brazil.
Some of those fucking fights were not 

297
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,070
that show I was on.
They filmed a show before.

298
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,250
At the same time they are doing the 1:55
pound tournament in there and watching 

299
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,430
these guys,
the guy that,

300
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:53,230
the guy that wanted actually had gone 
through,

301
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,780
he got,
he got cut in the first fight,

302
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,810
got cut in the second fight and then one
of the 30 minute fighting,

303
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:04,811
a third fight with two big cuts on her.
I mean these guys are going.

304
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,600
They went at it in there.
It was a different world back then,

305
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:08,950
man.
It was a different world.

306
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,930
Thirty minutes,
a 30 minute rounds.

307
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,890
Thirty minutes straight.

308
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,970
Yeah,
and essentially no rules.

309
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,180
Do you remember when Gary Goodridge 
reached into the Pedro's pants and 

310
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,151
grabbed his dick and balls?
He grabbed his dick and balls and 

311
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,150
squeezes Dick and balls.
I remember that.

312
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,890
That was like a big deal.
Whatever it is,

313
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:26,240
like,
can he fucking do that?

314
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:27,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

315
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,400
He can do this.

316
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,620
No eye gouging.
Nobody couldn't grab the ropes and no 

317
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:33,620
oil,
I think was the,

318
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,570
everything that's growing.
Strategy,

319
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,310
legal,
headbutts elbows.

320
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,330
How many Dudes were oiled up though?
A lot of oil.

321
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:40,750
God,

322
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,910
I actually called them,
went in the back end,

323
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:47,911
was taped.
We actually took the oil away from 

324
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:47,911
vandelay and uh,
and uh,

325
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:48,160
and uh,
what's his name?

326
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,910
Impella in the back of Coleman's.
Got My,

327
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,280
grabbed it from oil it up enough for it 
to kickboxing.

328
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,940
It's so funny how the world has changed 
now.

329
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,730
I remember I was there for your first 
fight in the UFC to.

330
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,870
You fought that knowingly knowing 
Hernandez and he was a boxer and I 

331
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:14,361
remember already didn't know that you 
were a wrestler up until that fight 

332
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:14,490
right.

333
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,270
Note to the weigh ins,
because I said the big thing was we,

334
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:19,350
we're going away in,
right?

335
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,490
And I'm thinking,
I made the UFC for Wayne and Wayne is in

336
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,310
on the bathroom scale,
like cutting weight and

337
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
not like a digital bathroom scales.
It was one of them aluminum that she 

338
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:34,530
asked me.

339
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,060
They asked me,
hey,

340
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,830
I know he was two pounds over.
Is that right?

341
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:38,680
I looked at him and right

342
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,320
scale,
let me get back on here.

343
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:49,321
I get out how to make weight.
You gotta kidding me?

344
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,590
That's hilarious.
By the.

345
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,310
And I said something about it and he 
actually,

346
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,840
he didn't know her as a rather.
He saw,

347
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,220
hey,
you better keep this standard if you 

348
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:02,220
want to come back again because in the 
back I'm like,

349
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,070
all right.
Whatever man.

350
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,870
Yeah.
A lot of people don't know about that.

351
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:08,350
That's some fucking bullshit.
It's supposed to be mma.

352
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:11,530
You know that someone would say that to 
you especially right before a fight.

353
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:12,910
You better fight a certain way.

354
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,700
Yeah,
it was.

355
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,200
I mean,
he was,

356
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,940
I don't know.
I don't know what his thing was.

357
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,690
He didn't like my hair cut either.
He told me that you can't get rid of 

358
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:24,650
that Erica.

359
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,120
Meanwhile,
2013.

360
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:34,320
You still rocking it.
Fucking dated.

361
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,520
That's hilarious.
Outdated in [inaudible].

362
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:36,930
Ninety seven was.
When was it?

363
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,830
When was it?
Okay.

364
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:41,500
The fucking time of the pilgrims.
That was the real Mohawks.

365
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,720
I mean when,
when was it?

366
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:44,220
Okay.
If it's outdated?

367
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,360
Yeah,
I dunno.

368
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,340
I Dunno what he was trying to say.
Whatever you like my hair cut.

369
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,210
Yeah.
Well,

370
00:15:49,211 --> 00:15:50,740
you know what?
Nobody knew you then,

371
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,770
you know in time.
And he would have had to accept it.

372
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:59,310
I couldn't have seen when you were on 
your fucking title reign him coming up 

373
00:15:59,310 --> 00:15:59,310
to you.
Listen man,

374
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,061
you fucking haircuts outdated enough 
already with his Mohawk cover up that 

375
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:05,740
tattoo in your head to Shit's 
ridiculous.

376
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,630
It's funny that the things that people 
choose to focus on,

377
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,920
you know,
you guys were there those early days,

378
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:15,270
you know,

379
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,500
talkative.
We were just talking to the car on the 

380
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,031
way here,
but I remember like going out at those 

381
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:23,660
covert challenge in Temecula and having 
them up muscle.

382
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:26,170
The guy to get my guys paid $100.
100.

383
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:26,900
You know,
I,

384
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:29,040
it's like we didn't make any money on 
this.

385
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,810
I'm looking at,
I'm like,

386
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,260
I don't care,
we don't have a kid of the gate and the 

387
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:35,260
case getting two,
$100,

388
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,191
but we're not.
Business partners were private 

389
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:41,330
contractors and it was sold out.
Not to mention your things.

390
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:43,850
I mean the place is packed.
If you didn't make any money,

391
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:48,851
you're an idiot.
Was that one of those fights where it 

392
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:48,860
was like a pankration style where they 
had to use open palms?

393
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,670
Yeah,
yeah,

394
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,100
yeah.
It's interesting.

395
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:53,180
We have.
Well we used to have.

396
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,700
We out of me and Scott Adams is come 
down with like,

397
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,930
I think that one of them,
we had eight guys on the card,

398
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,370
so we had like a,
you know,

399
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,870
most of the card.
Yeah.

400
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,120
Scott Adams is one of the first guys who
was like a leg lock specialists,

401
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,180
you know,
like he became synonymous with like leg 

402
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,180
locks.
Everybody knew.

403
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,380
Oh yeah,
yeah.

404
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,800
It is crazy.
I mean they,

405
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,140
they know,
they like locks as long as fight was in 

406
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,140
the use for.
It was three,

407
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,170
three minutes in 3:14.
I think,

408
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,720
you know,
when you guys were competing back then 

409
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,080
when you came in and UFC 18 or 13.
Yeah,

410
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,780
I started working at 12.
So you were 17,

411
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,730
so when you guys were back there and 
when you look back at that now,

412
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,090
like the where the UFC is now,
it's so fucking crazy.

413
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:41,091
It's like,
did you ever think that it could ever 

414
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:43,611
get this big talk into the microphone 
for you?

415
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,430
Those people are still telling chuck in 
the car and I can't believe how huge a 

416
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,450
MMA has gotten.
Oh,

417
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,460
it's insane.
I get pulled over on the way over here 

418
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:54,460
and go fast.
You know,

419
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,770
I was trying to get here quick and the 
guy comes out,

420
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,650
he recognized me.
He goes,

421
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,600
what are you doing?
I go on my podcast studios over here.

422
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,640
I'm doing a podcast with ensign.
Anyway,

423
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,990
goes,
get the fuck outta here.

424
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,430
Wow.
Yeah,

425
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,330
chocolate dells with them.
He goes,

426
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:11,331
Holy Shit.
I thought he was going to ask to come 

427
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:14,031
and sit in.
I'm going to hide the weed and this guy 

428
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:14,460
gets in here.
But uh,

429
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,520
you know where it is now.
It's like,

430
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,130
you know,
you could say the word Anderson Silva to

431
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:21,290
anybody you know,
and p,

432
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,070
oh,
I heard that guy know that guy is,

433
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,990
I get so popular now.
It's,

434
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,490
I never would've thought it would've 
gotten to this point eventually.

435
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:31,260
I just thought it would be a long time 
coming.

436
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:33,360
I mean,
I thought it was going to take or take a

437
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:38,361
long time as well.
Once we got our free TV was,

438
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:44,150
it was over.
There's never been a sport in our 

439
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,921
lifetimes.
That was complete obscurity in the 

440
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:46,140
nineties.
And then huge today.

441
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:51,310
I mean,
this is the only sport like that that 

442
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,061
we've ever seen and the difference in 
the athletes and the difference in the 

443
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:57,390
level of competition from 1993 to your 
title reign to today.

444
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:57,900
I mean it's,
it's,

445
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:02,901
uh,
it's amazing when you see the evolution 

446
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:02,901
of the sport so,
so fast and it's fucking crazy.

447
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:04,880
So now you slow down for a second year.
Your,

448
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,910
your,
your past.

449
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,200
You two guys are responsible for some of
the most exciting moments in the history

450
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,020
of this sport.
Man.

451
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,170
Your fight with ego.
Vav changin might be one of the fucking 

452
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,010
wildest exchanges.
Somebody wrote a,

453
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,100
somebody had a youtube clip.
It took a clip of just the first 

454
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,280
exchange where you guys were winging 
punches.

455
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,350
Man.
Everybody thought in that fight.

456
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:33,351
Well,
Igor is a striker and since probably 

457
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:35,631
going to take them down and try to 
submit them the fuck you were swinging 

458
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:45,290
while I watched it live.
I remember that was when you had to 

459
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:45,290
watch them.
They were on like 4:00

460
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:50,241
in the morning and in America you 
remember that because it was Erin live 

461
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:50,340
in Japan and you would.

462
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,390
And we would all stay up late to watch 
pride like late night on paper view.

463
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:57,750
And I remember it was me and a couple of
guys from Jujitsu in the house.

464
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:00,320
We were fucking screaming at the top of 
my.

465
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,460
We were like,
Holy Shit.

466
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,910
Because it was just like a movie scene,
like came in throwing these fucking 

467
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,920
bomb.
It's like you just bit down on your 

468
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:12,920
mouthpiece and said,
fuck it.

469
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,650
Let's do it.
Take them to,

470
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,630
you know,
to take him where he lives.

471
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,480
That,
that was a crazy fight man.

472
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,340
Do you ever look back on fights like 
that?

473
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:21,500
Going,
what the fuck was I?

474
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,150
Was I thinking there?

475
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,620
Basically what people don't understand 
is my why.

476
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,830
I went into my fight to a little deeper 
thing I was thinking of growing as a 

477
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,881
person and I didn't really worry that 
much about the wind losses because in my

478
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:41,041
types of fights I never ever was 
pressured on winning and losing because 

479
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:41,710
my friends were always fun.
Is always exciting.

480
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:41,870
So

481
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:47,220
is that a difference in the way the 
Japanese fans view fights as opposed to 

482
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,370
American fans who so much emphasis

483
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,810
on victory on winning?

484
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,570
Well,
see,

485
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:52,570
what's hard now is that,
you know,

486
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:54,350
I,
I can say yes,

487
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:59,351
I'd rather have the fighters fight with 
more honor and more about the pride and 

488
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:04,151
the deep thing about the fight.
But it's hard because back in the day 

489
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:04,950
when we were fighting,
there are no big sponsors you,

490
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,770
you'd never made six figures,
you know,

491
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,810
it wasn't.
There wasn't much pressure about winning

492
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:10,670
and losing.
Back in the day,

493
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:12,290
was you feeding,
fighting for peanuts?

494
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,110
Basically if you're fighting in the ring
and putting your life on the line,

495
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:17,000
that ring,
it's about pride and honor,

496
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:22,030
you know,
so the fights are different and you say 

497
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,130
you,
you'd say like two fighters,

498
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:22,510
like,
you know,

499
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,520
is that the,
is that discernible for people to fight 

500
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:27,520
that way now?
No,

501
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,970
it isn't because they have so much to 
gain from it.

502
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:31,660
Now they can make set their life within,
you know,

503
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,480
winning and losing is a whole different 
thing right now in this day,

504
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:35,690
you know?

505
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,150
So for you it wasn't about winning and 
losing.

506
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,060
It's about finding what you were.

507
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,890
Well,
it was basically,

508
00:21:40,891 --> 00:21:41,750
um,
for me,

509
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:46,751
I wanted to learn something.
MMA for me was a stepping stone in my 

510
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:47,990
life as a man to grow.
I mean,

511
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:52,991
when are you gonna ever be put in a 
willingly walk into an area that you 

512
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:55,040
possibly might die that day?
You know what I mean?

513
00:21:55,210 --> 00:22:00,210
The stress and the fears and the 
anxieties you got to overcome in that 

514
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,960
moment is not something you're going to 
ever gain in a day to day,

515
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:04,820
daily lifetime routine.
I mean,

516
00:22:04,821 --> 00:22:09,821
we're lucky as fighters to grow 
spiritually and grow meant in our heart 

517
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:12,830
as far as facing that fear every day.
I mean,

518
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,120
you can get hit with a wrong punching.
This guy can hurt you real bad.

519
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,080
People didn't just respect that,
but they responded to that in a big way.

520
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:24,650
That attitude Yamanto dementia is that I
said,

521
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,180
yeah,
I was nicknamed in Japan and that means

522
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:32,290
it means a Japanese spirit,
which was actually used back in the 

523
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,050
summer idea,
so I translated as a sunrise spirit

524
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,420
and you became known for that attitude 
and people knew that when ensign anyway 

525
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,310
stepped into the ring of the cage,
there was no plane.

526
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:47,311
It's safe.
There will be some wild shit going down 

527
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:49,470
every single time and they loved you for
that.

528
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:52,200
The ovation that you got in Japan 
because of that,

529
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,100
the word jargon.

530
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,480
It was.
It was.

531
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,870
It was a real good nickname to.
I'm basically,

532
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,740
when I got it,
I didn't know how,

533
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,020
how big the word was and from,
from being okay,

534
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:05,630
that's cool.
Kanji to wool,

535
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:11,140
they named me that too.
Now I'm actually trying to live my life 

536
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,600
to be as close as I can to that way of 
life,

537
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,160
you know,
which is hard.

538
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,220
So when they named you that,
did you feel like a big obligation 

539
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,220
because of that?

540
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,800
Yeah,
at first I didn't know what it meant and

541
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:23,070
then when I found out what it meant,
I was really questioning myself like,

542
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,990
do I,
you know,

543
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:30,050
I mean I showed in a ring.
I mean it's not just about being in the 

544
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,300
ring and I have my fears in the ring 
too.

545
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,940
I mean if you watch the eager for that 
first I was,

546
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I think the tackle I through a right and
from there I was going to stand toe to 

547
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,421
toe,
but all of a sudden I found myself 

548
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:41,421
clenching,
you know?

549
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:41,550
So I got my fears and everyone doesn't 
see that.

550
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:46,551
If you look back at the video,
you'll see that I had fear took over me 

551
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:50,891
for a moment and I,
I beat that battle like I released them 

552
00:23:50,891 --> 00:23:51,920
through those.
But um,

553
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,170
you know,
I fight that fear too,

554
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,550
you know,
so as far as you know,

555
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,910
people say I'm going to do that mushy.

556
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,390
The he the undying spirit,
you know,

557
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:00,600
never,
never taps.

558
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:03,920
It never gives up.
But there are so many times in the fight

559
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:08,921
if you really look at it that I'm 
fighting that myself and I'm standing 

560
00:24:08,921 --> 00:24:12,281
there thinking,
am I justified to Caritas men because I 

561
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:12,800
think in the middle of a fine.
Yeah.

562
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:15,590
I mean for me,
when I say Yamamoto,

563
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,670
dominancy the summer spirit to,
to have an experience to grow your 

564
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:20,670
spirit to,
to that level,

565
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,580
every time you have an opportunity to do
it.

566
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:24,500
It does.
It's not exactly.

567
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,240
I can't tell you that.
Okay,

568
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:31,530
doing this is going to be with our 
experience because it depends on the 

569
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:31,530
person.
You know,

570
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,270
like a,
a driver.

571
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,280
If he,
you tell them to get in the car and take

572
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:39,281
a hairpin turn at 200 miles per hour,
it will be an experience for him to 

573
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:39,380
build his heart because he does it.

574
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,330
But if I were to do that Shit,
hell yeah,

575
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:43,160
I'd probably be freaking sit in my 
pants,

576
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:44,510
you know?
So for me,

577
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,790
I mean,
I mean when I go into the ring,

578
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,500
you know,
it's like it's,

579
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,120
it's the situation that happens.
So it was perfect for me for egos for it

580
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:57,590
because if I went and stood in and just 
threw it out and just threw off from the

581
00:24:57,591 --> 00:24:59,210
beginning,
it'd be like cool,

582
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,880
I conquer,
I conquered that anxiety and that fear.

583
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:06,110
But it wasn't really a phenomenal 
experience because it wouldn't have been

584
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:07,250
if I didn't clinch.
So.

585
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:12,310
So what happened?
What made me happy was I actually had 

586
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,310
that fear take over me,
you know?

587
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,930
So for me,
I did some growing in my heart because I

588
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:18,210
clenched and I actually hesitated and 
thinking of trying to take them down and

589
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:19,340
sending,
getting top position.

590
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Wow.
Do you think that when you look at like 

591
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,141
that,
that attitude towards fighting and you 

592
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:30,461
look at how that attitude towards 
fighting was sort of a part of that era 

593
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,890
where there wasn't that much money to be
made and there wasn't that much on the 

594
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,211
line too.
When do you think that those days are 

595
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:40,211
gone?
Like,

596
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:40,211
well,
it is.

597
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:41,740
It is because the rules.
I mean they stopped,

598
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:46,741
fades away faster.
Now I basically see a lot of fights 

599
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:51,271
where,
where are the spirit will start taking 

600
00:25:51,271 --> 00:25:52,660
over someone the fights or stopped,
but I understand it's a sport you'd have

601
00:25:52,661 --> 00:25:54,430
sponsors is,
has to be televised.

602
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,950
It can't be too brutal and that's 
understandable.

603
00:25:56,951 --> 00:26:00,430
There's just,
it's like a damn.

604
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:01,450
If you do,
damned if you don't,

605
00:26:01,451 --> 00:26:01,860
you know,
I,

606
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,560
when I see some of those fights,
I,

607
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,010
I cringe because I think this is right 
here.

608
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:11,011
This is where this guy's heart's going 
to have to kick in and they stopped the 

609
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:11,011
fight in the state.

610
00:26:11,011 --> 00:26:11,250
Yeah.
Again,

611
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:12,440
kind credit bummed at that,
you know?

612
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,540
No one else was big.
Was that 10 minute first round and 

613
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,390
pride.
We have fun within 10 minute.

614
00:26:18,391 --> 00:26:20,050
First round was big.
Yeah,

615
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,760
that was great because you know,
five minutes shit just gets interesting.

616
00:26:23,761 --> 00:26:25,380
You're,
you're halfway through,

617
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,500
you've got five more minutes after five 
minutes of hell.

618
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,650
That first round was incredible,

619
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,520
but it's not exactly the best thing for 
you.

620
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,750
If you want to find sponsors and 
televise it and get people attracted to 

621
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,310
it that don't understand the sport,
you know,

622
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:39,610
it's.

623
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

624
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,010
It's,
it's a kind of a balancing act isn't.

625
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,120
Yeah,
it's hard man.

626
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,810
It's hard.
I mean,

627
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,330
how do you soften up cage fighting 
though?

628
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:50,360
You know what I mean?
How do you soften up mixed martial arts.

629
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:56,170
You're stopping the fight sooner.
You know there is bisping Belfort this 

630
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,290
weekend,
so I'll stop fight.

631
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:03,370
We stopped a little soon,
stopped too soon.

632
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,670
He's laying in the fetal position with 
the guy behind him throwing hammerfest.

633
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:13,970
You're not trying to defend you.
At no point are you trying to defend 

634
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,530
yourself,
right?

635
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:19,970
I mean,
he wasn't stopping him from rolling up 

636
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:19,970
to his,
to his belly.

637
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,690
He wasn't trying.
Stopping them from trying to get up and 

638
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:23,690
he wasn't trying to get out.
Yeah.

639
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,440
So what I ended up defending his,
I mean the only question I had was why 

640
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:30,550
do they touch him?
Step back,

641
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,030
it went,
it's over,

642
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,520
didn't last very long.
I mean he dropped him and then,

643
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:41,521
you know,
you look at the replay you're dealing 

644
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:41,521
with,
you're only talking about

645
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:44,210
a couple of seconds shots to the body 
and he hit him too.

646
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,210
I think it was two times ahead.
And then he went,

647
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,310
went to a couple of others by.
But he had,

648
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,840
he didn't even try to roll back up.
He wasn't trying to get out.

649
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,670
He turned his back.
It was,

650
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,360
it was over here and that was what's 
going on with the volume,

651
00:27:56,361 --> 00:27:57,410
man.
What are you doing here?

652
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,610
It's varying.
That was a big fucking head kick.

653
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,510
Those,
those clean.

654
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,700
I mean he wasn't trying,
trying to defend himself.

655
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:06,020
He,
I,

656
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,550
he didn't look like he was trying to do 
it,

657
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,390
you know,
I don't,

658
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,550
I mean nothing against it.
I mean he was,

659
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,980
I don't think he knew where he was at 
that point.

660
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,500
Instincts kicked in.
He was defending I and I'm,

661
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:17,060
I'm all for,
I like,

662
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:18,080
I think at the top level.

663
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,630
I'm all for letting it go a little 
longer.

664
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,420
I've,
I've,

665
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,160
I,
I complained a little bit about guys.

666
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,940
I mean I understand stopping real quick 
at the lower levels,

667
00:28:25,941 --> 00:28:28,250
but at the higher levels mean these 
guys,

668
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,810
that's their career,
their life,

669
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:31,100
they,
they've been there.

670
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:34,580
They know you gotta give him a chance to
all the way out of it because we've seen

671
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,760
fights with big,
big nog almost almost out.

672
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,910
Hold on and coming back and winning the 
fight.

673
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,310
Frankie Edgar or Frankie Edgar.
Yeah.

674
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,710
Motherfucker comes back.
Holy Shit.

675
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,360
Crazy.
You know,

676
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,640
second fight within a lot of times like 
that where you've seen guys that and 

677
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,991
then you go,
then you see another fight where you 

678
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:55,991
know that got schizophrenia.
Hold on a second.

679
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:02,110
We got a real problem with referees.
Have itchy trigger fingers and referees 

680
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,540
that get involved too much in like the 
telling guys to fight and like when they

681
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:08,840
are fighting and they just make their 
presence known too much,

682
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:12,390
there's just too much intervention by 
them need to.

683
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,440
They need to learn how to step back and 
too many fights get called where you 

684
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:19,190
have to look at the incident report like
the.

685
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,490
The controversial this weekend about 
hitting the back of the head goes,

686
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,900
oh,
it was terrible.

687
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,650
I didn't get hit once in a band called 
the fight,

688
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:32,651
a no contest and I don't know if it's.
I don't know if the guy was complaining 

689
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:34,040
what happened,
but he hit him once with an elbow to the

690
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:39,041
ear,
clean elbow and then punch to the side 

691
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:39,320
of the head and saying,
wash the back of the head,

692
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:44,321
wash the back of the head and I don't if
the dude on the bottom was saying 

693
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:44,770
something,
but it was bad.

694
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,270
It was terrible.
Terrible call.

695
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,850
That's a.
that's happened in Brazil a couple of 

696
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:51,850
times.
That happened with the Eric Silva fight.

697
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,981
When Eric Silva got a same thing.
Mario Yamasaki called it a no contest 

698
00:29:55,981 --> 00:29:56,830
from shots to the back of the head

699
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,460
and the guy played it up to.
Huh?

700
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,120
He definitely played it out because he 
was holding the back of his head and 

701
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,601
then you see the instant replay in the 
elbows hit him in the year that his pad.

702
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,730
I was kind of stoked when I heard the 
Dana tweeted something today.

703
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,370
I will never find the UFC again.
Really?

704
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:15,210
I think he tweeted that.
Wow.

705
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,690
I was thinking the same thing.
I think I should never forgetting the 

706
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:20,690
octagon ever again.
That guy's a disgrace to the sport.

707
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Yeah.
It's sad when you see guys do shit like 

708
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:25,720
that and they see

709
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,210
someone looking for a way out and 
looking for an excuse,

710
00:30:27,211 --> 00:30:27,900
like,
listen man,

711
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:33,170
this is fucking camera there and there's
a camera there and there's a camera 

712
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,171
there.
Everyone can see what those shots land 

713
00:30:36,171 --> 00:30:36,171
like.
I Dunno what.

714
00:30:36,171 --> 00:30:37,140
You can't just pretend that it hit you 
in the back of the head.

715
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:42,300
I don't know what happened there,
but refereeing bad refereeing socks,

716
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:46,170
but bad judging is even more prevalent 
in bad referee.

717
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,210
We got a lot of that.
Okay.

718
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:52,470
First off with ref ref judging it.
It's hard anyway.

719
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,380
Yes,
absolutely.

720
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,660
But then you put that with a lot of guys
just don't understand the sport.

721
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,250
They don't understand either the Jujitsu
or they don't understand the striking or

722
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:07,251
you don't.
I mean and they're judging it on the 

723
00:31:07,251 --> 00:31:08,490
highest level and the highest level and 
they don't really understand.

724
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,500
You know,
when the guys working for summer,

725
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,900
I was like,
I mean you guys,

726
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,940
Oh,
you got to count that.

727
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:17,130
Attempted submission will hey,
thrown your legs up into a triangle.

728
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,820
Like this is not attended to mission.
You know,

729
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,920
it's got to be closer than that.
If you want to call it an attempt 

730
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,340
attempted submission or it's got to be 
fights to fight out of it.

731
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,540
I mean in wrestling,
take takedown.

732
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,410
Which takedowns good.
I mean how much,

733
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,840
how much do you can either take down?

734
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,950
I was getting up or getting back up.
How has escaped his escape?

735
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,730
What's the skateboard?
When you were fighting,

736
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,500
you were famous for you take down 
defense,

737
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:45,501
but you're also famous for being able to
get up off the bottom when you thought 

738
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:46,140
if you got taken down,
were you thinking,

739
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:51,141
man,
how much are the judges gonna pay 

740
00:31:51,141 --> 00:31:51,141
attention to this.
Even if I get right back up real quick,

741
00:31:51,141 --> 00:31:52,380
how much does that score?
Well,

742
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:55,050
I never worried about that.
I mean my thing was I was always.

743
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,450
It's a lot easier to get back up if you 
start as soon as I hit the ground.

744
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,580
Right.
You know,

745
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,890
if I let you get on top of me and get 
set,

746
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,650
it's real hard to get off my back.
Right.

747
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,520
But if you get to take down,
it's not over.

748
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,630
This isn't college.
You're not.

749
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,130
No one's throwing up two points.

750
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,750
I got.
I'm still,

751
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,490
I'm still.
As soon as we hit the ground,

752
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:19,491
I'm fighting your take that.
And my thing was always I just always 

753
00:32:19,491 --> 00:32:19,491
trying to find a guy,
you know,

754
00:32:19,491 --> 00:32:21,410
I'm saying offensive so he can't hit me 
on down.

755
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:26,420
He can't really score with them down 
there and I don't really think of a guy 

756
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,961
just tastes guy down and holds him 
unless nothing else has really done in 

757
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:30,280
the round.
It doesn't mean that you should,

758
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:35,300
when you got to take down and you 
haven't been able to land a punch having

759
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,500
Atlanta done anything.
If he gets up and land some punches 

760
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:40,500
standing and he just went around.
So

761
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,050
is it a case a lot of times of a guy 
trying to conserve energy or trying to 

762
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,320
figure out when to explode when he gets 
taken down where he like,

763
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,560
he'll hang on for a second and then 
start moving.

764
00:32:49,561 --> 00:32:54,561
Whereas you would,
as soon as you're back touches the 

765
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:54,561
ground,
you're scooting,

766
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:54,561
you're,
you're,

767
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:55,710
you're fighting for under hooks.

768
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,820
The problem I tell a lot of guys all the
time is if you get down and you take 

769
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,410
that,
get that,

770
00:33:01,411 --> 00:33:02,880
oh shit moment.
Oh Shit.

771
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,250
Get flattened out.
As soon as he did that.

772
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,200
If I mean you're sorry,
now you're going to.

773
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,770
Now it's gonna.
Be a bitch to get off your back.

774
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,280
But,
you know,

775
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,280
my thing is as soon as you've done,
there's a little space,

776
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,510
even when you hit a good hearts,
good takedown.

777
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,860
UHM,
there's balance.

778
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:18,600
Guess what,
that is.

779
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,540
Space is that space now I'm pushing 
already.

780
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,850
I'm already working and get back up.
So I mean that,

781
00:33:24,851 --> 00:33:25,830
that's,
that,

782
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:28,020
that helps you get,
continue to get up.

783
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,030
But what's interesting is you guys had 
to figure that shit out in the cage.

784
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:37,031
Like there wasn't like a whole series of
fighters that came before you that have 

785
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:38,150
already figured that out.
Like essentially,

786
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:41,060
you know,
take down defense and the ability to get

787
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:45,080
up off the bottom and an mma fight was 
kinda written by you.

788
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,220
Yeah.
Well I mean I,

789
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:51,430
I put together some stuff from John 
Lewis taught me how get out one this way

790
00:33:52,141 --> 00:33:54,590
and it's got to have somebody on a role 
with that knee bar this way.

791
00:33:54,591 --> 00:33:59,060
And I kind of figured out how to do a 
push pull thing with the guys and I just

792
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:01,640
changed something right at the end of 
each thing to get.

793
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,520
Because instead of going through that 
knee bar,

794
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,560
I get halfway there and just stand up 
and guess what,

795
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:09,500
if I get halfway there,
so I get people off balanced and I could

796
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:14,501
go,
I do a push pull and make it so I tried 

797
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:14,501
to get you to push real hard to stop 
this one.

798
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:17,630
I go the other way and you stopped that 
and then I pop under the other way.

799
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:23,030
But it's kind of fascinating when you 
think about it because you had to kind 

800
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,500
of figure all that out.
Like there wasn't like you came along in

801
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:30,501
[inaudible] 97.
I mean there wasn't a lot of dudes who 

802
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:30,501
had already done that before.
You were.

803
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,660
There was like,
you look at a guy like Rory Macdonald is

804
00:34:33,661 --> 00:34:38,661
training at Tristar,
has got George St Pierre and his camp 

805
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:41,181
for us a hobby.
They got fucking charts and graphs and 

806
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:44,540
dry erase boards where they're writing 
down to every day's workout where 

807
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,960
they're trying to break it down to each 
individual technique and skill.

808
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,350
We're trying to figure it out.
When we

809
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,720
came in and you know,
everyone's trying to figure out.

810
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,080
Most guys came in with one thing,
you know,

811
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,120
wrestling or striking or some Jujitsu 
and then come in and they're trying to 

812
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,291
mix them all together and we're also 
trying to figure out how to train them 

813
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:02,291
together.
Like,

814
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:05,910
okay,
how do I train my wrestling and my age 

815
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:05,910
at my am,
my striking in my Jujitsu together,

816
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:10,720
like how do I,
what's the white balance of working out 

817
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,901
here and there?
How well with strength training in how 

818
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:13,901
to,
how do I mix everything,

819
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:14,090
you know,
it was,

820
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,270
it was an interesting time and 
challenging.

821
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,220
It's challenging and you know,
now you got guys like you said,

822
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:24,370
and you'll see guys get better and 
better because you got guys that now 

823
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:24,370
they've learned in mixed martial arts 
from the start,

824
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,520
you know,
and they,

825
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:29,090
and they start and they have and they 
have coaches that know how to train it.

826
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,810
They'll have a teaching and then there's
still gonna be innovative.

827
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:37,811
A little bit of navy guys are still 
going to create their own little things 

828
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:38,790
that work better for you or for him.
Whatever body type you off.

829
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,930
No,
I talked to you about this and you don't

830
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,810
know what have you thought about opening
up a gym?

831
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,310
Are you thinking about trying to open it
up,

832
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,440
open a gym?
I mean,

833
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:52,470
I,
I don't know if I'm going to get into 

834
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,290
all that coaching guys to fight,
but I always like working with guys that

835
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:54,460
are fighting,
you know,

836
00:35:54,461 --> 00:35:59,461
and like working with different things 
and showing them things I like or I do 

837
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:02,410
different than what they're used to 
doing and seeing someone use it.

838
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,590
You know,
if you've got a guy that show that.

839
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:10,930
I think my favorite thing,
I remember teaching forest had a fine 

840
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:11,920
point to something you've done forever 
and he said,

841
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,840
I thought that was a bullshit move.
It never worked.

842
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,980
I just thought,
oh,

843
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,320
that's what I was doing wrong,
because now it just,

844
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,290
it worked.
It was just a guard,

845
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,730
a guard pass thing,
but it was.

846
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:22,820
He's like,
Oh man,

847
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,610
damn,
that's what I was missing.

848
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,900
You know?
And that's fun for me.

849
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,980
Will you enjoy teaching?
I was just saying that you were talking 

850
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:30,980
about before the podcast ever started 
about glover.

851
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,790
You've been training with glover and 
getting him ready for his fight with 

852
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:35,790
rampages weekend.

853
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,970
Yeah.
I've been working with over the last two

854
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:39,250
fights.
You'll after he got back in the US.

855
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,370
I mean I even away from uh,
you know,

856
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,920
he was training for a long time and then
he went,

857
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,960
went back to get stuck in Brazil for a 
few years and so I know when I was 

858
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,680
working with them with stuff that we 
used to do,

859
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,830
um,
some of the stuff that he's forgotten.

860
00:36:53,831 --> 00:36:54,550
Oh yeah.
That's,

861
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,320
that's why that's not working.
Okay.

862
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,210
You know,
little little fine points and you know,

863
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,600
because I know I had the same thing.
I come back from having done that 

864
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:03,600
movement one I'll be why isn't this 
working?

865
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,290
Oh yeah.
Just

866
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:09,930
you just forget one small little 
technical aspects of difference of a 

867
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,090
makes a whole difference.
Yeah.

868
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:14,640
It's fascinating how much when you look 
at the,

869
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,990
you look at athleticism and you look at 
like just sheer strength and size.

870
00:37:17,991 --> 00:37:22,991
That's all well and good,
but it's really fascinating how much 

871
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,930
actual technique is involved and just 
subtle variations and changes in that 

872
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,470
technique.
Make all the difference in the world and

873
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:32,471
that's something that the lay person 
doesn't understand and that's something 

874
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:34,730
that it's a shame when judges don't 
understand it

875
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,300
and that's the hard part.
It's,

876
00:37:37,301 --> 00:37:42,301
I mean even just.
I mean some of them I don't think they 

877
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:42,301
quite understand that.
The basics.

878
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,800
No.
The government workers,

879
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:45,480
they might as well be working for the 
DMV.

880
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,030
They got a Gig and they went in and they
learned how to,

881
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:49,140
you know,
this is a triangle.

882
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,440
This is an arm bar.
This is a kick.

883
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,610
I don't know.

884
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,240
Times I've watched around and just gone,
okay,

885
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:59,930
I want to see the judge that gave that 
round to that guy and have him explain 

886
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:01,140
it to me.
I just want to watch.

887
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:02,820
I just want to it just for my own 
entertainment.

888
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:03,990
I want to.
I want to hear him explain.

889
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:09,620
Justify was an ultimate fighters I 
watched.

890
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,520
It was the,
it was the live one.

891
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:17,090
I remember I went to overtime and in the
overtime it was two to one for one guy 

892
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,380
and I'm like looking at it going.
It was all standing.

893
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,310
One guy threw two punches,
didn't land one of them,

894
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,670
the other guy probably landed five or 
six punches the hole round,

895
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:32,060
but chase the guy,
the whole round one of the judges 

896
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,130
actually gave it to the guy that threw 
two punches in the air.

897
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,560
It never landed a punch and was running 
the whole time.

898
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm like,
what?

899
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,570
Are you watching?
Any,

900
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,600
any?
I was like,

901
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,520
you gotta be kidding me.
I actually had on Tivo.

902
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,030
Every wound it went okay.
I couldn't.

903
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,710
I,
I must've watched around wrong.

904
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:49,570
I wasn't paying attention.
I must've saw ms dot.

905
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:51,140
Let me see what I missed.
Okay.

906
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,450
Okay.
No punches.

907
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:53,310
No landed,
none.

908
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,990
Freeze.
They were all guys who,

909
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,840
a lot of them are from boxing,
especially in Nevada.

910
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,870
Nevada has a lot of like Adelaide.
Given Dana a hard time about it.

911
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:06,520
It's like a guys.
He doesn't pick the referees.

912
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,050
It's not.
It's not up to here.

913
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,800
He can't do anything about it.
Not always out of about

914
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,210
promoter.
You really,

915
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:11,990
you know,
you don't.

916
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,480
You don't get any say whatsoever.
You can't.

917
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,250
You can't have any.
It's like it's illegal.

918
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,070
You can't have any say.
And who's,

919
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,610
who's judging?
We're not judging,

920
00:39:19,611 --> 00:39:24,611
you know,
that has to be done by the athletic 

921
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:26,291
commission.
No wonder he rips on the referring a 

922
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,310
lot.
I feel like the refereeing is,

923
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,800
is a lot of it is just,
it's fucking hard.

924
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,920
It's hard to make the right call in the 
moment and the

925
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:39,060
reference reference.
A lot of guys don't do it well,

926
00:39:39,381 --> 00:39:39,560
but yeah,

927
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,830
the judging is a disgrace.
The judging,

928
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:46,831
in my opinion is a disgrace.
I think people make errors as referees 

929
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:47,140
and that's just a part of being a human 
being.

930
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:52,141
But I feel like the referees for the 
most part know what the fuck is going 

931
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:55,051
on.
There's standouts like big John or herb 

932
00:39:55,051 --> 00:39:55,051
dean who like,
you know,

933
00:39:55,051 --> 00:39:56,830
they're always gonna Josh Rosenthal,
you know,

934
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:59,620
they're always going to ref a good fight
and even if they make an error,

935
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:04,360
it's rare and few and far between.
But some of these fucking judges,

936
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:09,361
man,
like you got to think they're just 

937
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:09,361
flipping a coin,
like they don't know what's happening.

938
00:40:09,361 --> 00:40:10,150
There's no way they know what's 
happening.

939
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,210
They just taken,
just taken a guess.

940
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,260
It's,
it's really a shame,

941
00:40:15,261 --> 00:40:16,840
man.
It really is a shame,

942
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,070
it's a,
it's,

943
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:23,100
it's when you see guys that are 
competing in the highest level of the 

944
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,701
game and they trained for six to eight 
weeks and they've given every fucking 

945
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:28,440
ounce of their soul and here they are 
and they,

946
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,850
they edge it,
they think they want,

947
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:32,630
you think they pulled it off and then 
you,

948
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,990
you know,
30,

949
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,460
27 for the other guy and you're like,
what the fuck?

950
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:41,670
And it's just nonsensical score.
So you threw away two months of this 

951
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,841
guy's life,
two months of fucking eating the right 

952
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:50,221
food and getting up in the morning and 
drinking a gallon of water every six 

953
00:40:50,221 --> 00:40:51,850
hours and you threw it all away because 
you're an incompetent

954
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:56,910
judge.
It's not even those ones where it's 

955
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:56,970
close.
Like he pulled it out close.

956
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,050
I mean the ones it was wasn't bothering 
me.

957
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,830
The one.
It's like,

958
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,840
ah,
okay,

959
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,640
okay,
I'll give you.

960
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,100
I'll give you that round was a toss up,
but the rest of the or how,

961
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,630
how did you lose any one of the.
I didn't,

962
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,440
I didn't lose the other side.
They lose them.

963
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,150
Some got them losing all three and 
you're like,

964
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,870
fucking crazy,
man.

965
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:25,810
You took a long time off.
You took six years off and then came 

966
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,330
back again in 2010 for one fight.

967
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,650
Yeah,
the,

968
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,550
I came back for that only because I got 
to,

969
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,260
I put in prison and uh,
the,

970
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,160
you know,
it was funny

971
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,380
because after I got to prison,
it was on national TV.

972
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:37,430
It was.
And all the newspapers,

973
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:42,431
magazines.
Funny how I start fading out of the 

974
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:42,431
media.
All of a sudden I get arrested.

975
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:43,190
I'm like a hot thing in the media again.
You know what I say

976
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,010
first the shocker.
So that's why the media.

977
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,160
But anyway,
you know,

978
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,310
when I got out,
you know,

979
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,110
when I would go to bars and stuff,
he was saying,

980
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:53,320
oh,
some people would say like,

981
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,230
oh,
I seen you on TV.

982
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,700
And I'm like,
fuck,

983
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:02,410
I'm thinking to myself,
is that the one with me handcuffed 

984
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,240
police or wasn't a.
Oh my God,

985
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,170
they hated that,
you know.

986
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:05,100
So I figured,
you know,

987
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,640
the only way to tell she'll make it up 
to my fans and let them know that I'm 

988
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:10,640
back.
You know,

989
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,721
you get drug tested in Japan,
we get marijuana is a big thing now in 

990
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:14,721
Japan.
We get tested for marijuana.

991
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:16,710
If you have any marijuana in your blood 
and Japan,

992
00:42:16,711 --> 00:42:18,660
you're not going to be able to fight.
What did you get arrested for?

993
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,250
What happened?

994
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,550
Well,
I had a 16 grams in my car.

995
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:30,030
I had a 20 joints I had.
We're going to have a little part in 

996
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,310
your and was on the way down and they do
a lot of inspection.

997
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:37,380
Just randomly.
They walk around and in Japan it's kind 

998
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:37,450
of unconstitutional where they don't 
need a reason to search you.

999
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,090
They'll come right up to your car and 
say I want chicken your car.

1000
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,010
And it's like I was stone and I had a 
had a joint.

1001
00:42:45,011 --> 00:42:50,011
I mean a real short on the dashboard and
you know when you're still in you think 

1002
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:52,500
you're getting sneaky with it.
It's like so bad.

1003
00:42:52,501 --> 00:42:54,000
It's like Ah,
what?

1004
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,990
What roads?
And I'm putting in my pocket and they're

1005
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,060
following me the whole time they send 
their parking.

1006
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,080
I'm like to put my phone in the pocket,
pull it behind my phone and said 

1007
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,080
nothing.
Parking.

1008
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,080
This is behind your phone though.

1009
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,550
So what,
how,

1010
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:13,650
like what is it like?
Is it like being caught with cocaine or 

1011
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,500
heroin?
Drugs that drug in Japan yet?

1012
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,350
So it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

1013
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:16,950
Yeah.
So I,

1014
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,500
um,
I was facing some bad time,

1015
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:20,380
you know,
because uh,

1016
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,010
I was a famous figure and they wanted to
make an example of me.

1017
00:43:24,011 --> 00:43:25,690
So.
Wow,

1018
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,470
what was the worst case scenario?
A,

1019
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,490
I think it was five years.
Oh fuck.

1020
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,280
Yeah.
So I was facing that.

1021
00:43:33,281 --> 00:43:38,281
Um,
it all dependent on what came up in my 

1022
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:38,590
house and my gym when they did the 
search next day.

1023
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,420
Wow.
And what came up?

1024
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,780
Nothing.
Nothing came up.

1025
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,530
So that saved you?
Yeah,

1026
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:44,830
well I was kind of baffled.

1027
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,340
Someone stole my fucking weed,

1028
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,730
thinking what it was.
Then the,

1029
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:03,050
the interrogation came to finding out 
where I got my stuff.

1030
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,470
Yeah.
And so when in Japan,

1031
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:11,150
if you throw everything to a foreign 
person deal drop,

1032
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,480
they won't want to go fight someone in 
America.

1033
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:19,590
I told them it was a student from Guam.
They asked me for her name and I said 

1034
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:23,390
Tony,
I knew like three tonys in Guam,

1035
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:26,830
so keep it real tony.
And,

1036
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:30,980
and we had like two days of questioning.
I mean he talking interrogation for like

1037
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:36,020
eight hours straight,
just interrogation and lay like the 

1038
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,340
third day they just so happened,
caught me off guard man.

1039
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,140
And they asked me what's Tony's last 
name and this fricken ridiculous.

1040
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:45,060
The first name that popped in my head 
was Montana.

1041
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,200
What?
I said,

1042
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,550
so what?
I said Montana.

1043
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,130
No,
fuck.

1044
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,310
If these guys watched scarf I don't see,
I'm screwed.

1045
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:00,000
You know what?
I'm screwed.

1046
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:02,880
Because they'll start the integration 
all over if I get caught in the lie.

1047
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:03,530
Right,
right,

1048
00:45:03,531 --> 00:45:04,620
right.
So he just,

1049
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:08,700
I saw him write it down in Japanese,
Montana and then he just jotted down and

1050
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:13,701
I was like,
scarface get translated into Japanese.

1051
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,320
Not that popular.
I don't think it's that popular there.

1052
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,920
Yeah.
That's fucking hilarious.

1053
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,240
Tony Montana gave me my marijuana.
You know,

1054
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,430
how long was where it's worth the trip.

1055
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,630
No.

1056
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,460
How long was your,
how long was the old deal from getting 

1057
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:34,460
arrested to getting cleared?

1058
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:39,250
Twenty eight days,
which isn't a big deal if you know it's 

1059
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,300
going to be 28 days when you're sitting 
in there and you don't know what's gonna

1060
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:45,320
Happen to you and you don't know what's 
going on in the outside world because 

1061
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,940
you're shut off and you're wondering if 
you're going to spend five years.

1062
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,390
It's Kinda a 20 days is a long,
28 days.

1063
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,840
So you went from there and you said,
fuck it,

1064
00:45:53,841 --> 00:45:55,670
I'm going to.
I'm going to take on another fight.

1065
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,520
I went in there and it was good for me 
actually.

1066
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,740
I mean I always think back and think,
okay,

1067
00:46:00,741 --> 00:46:02,180
I should have done this.
I should've done this.

1068
00:46:02,181 --> 00:46:07,181
If I hadn't put the roast,
Jeanette and I keep thinking that and I 

1069
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:07,181
catch my son thing.
Wait a minute.

1070
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:11,290
This is a probably one of the best 
things that happened to you because the 

1071
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:12,510
big biggest thing that happened to me in
that was I a,

1072
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:15,890
I learned how important my freedom was.
I mean,

1073
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,660
everyone takes it for granted every day.
Wake up,

1074
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:18,890
but what are you going to do today on 
this?

1075
00:46:18,891 --> 00:46:22,850
Like shit they got nothing to do is for 
overcast the Shitty Day.

1076
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,880
What am going to do so hot damn is.
This is a shitty day,

1077
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:27,050
you know,
but man,

1078
00:46:27,051 --> 00:46:29,270
just effect that you can choose to stay 
at home,

1079
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:34,660
you can choose to eat McDonald's or you 
can choose to just hang out or you can 

1080
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,090
choose to be bored,
you know,

1081
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:35,630
freedom.

1082
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:40,710
That freedom is awesome.
So it was something that really made me 

1083
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:41,180
realize that how important freedom was.
Yeah.

1084
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:43,430
A lot of people take it for granted.
You know,

1085
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:48,460
you dealing with a situation like that,
especially over something like we'd 

1086
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,361
where it's so nonsensical and crazy,
they could take away your freedom for 

1087
00:46:52,361 --> 00:46:52,580
fucking years.
Yeah.

1088
00:46:52,581 --> 00:46:56,300
The thing about that is served the time.
Went to the court.

1089
00:46:56,301 --> 00:46:59,570
We got three years probation where I 
couldn't leave Japan for three years.

1090
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:03,830
I didn't even get to go to my 
grandmother's funeral and I figured,

1091
00:47:03,831 --> 00:47:08,831
okay,
I gotta I gotTa be good these three 

1092
00:47:08,831 --> 00:47:10,871
years and then we'll start up again and 
then next thing I know I get a letter 

1093
00:47:10,871 --> 00:47:14,801
from the immigration telling me that I,
I just lost my green card because of 

1094
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:18,440
infringement and I got to leave Japan.
Whoa.

1095
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:19,130
And I'm like,
Whoa,

1096
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:21,110
wait a minute.
I've been here for 20 years.

1097
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,990
My whole life is here,
a boiler house there.

1098
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,180
I got GMCR,
I can't leave Japan.

1099
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,740
So I called them up and they had this 
like this road answer.

1100
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:31,180
Okay,
if you're contesting it,

1101
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:36,630
we're going to start an investigation.
You have to come down to immigration 

1102
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:36,630
center and Blah Blah,
blah.

1103
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:36,720
Went down,
took a,

1104
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,180
it was an eight month investigation.
I mean it was ridiculous.

1105
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:44,800
I mean to go down there numerous times 
and just like all day interrogations and

1106
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:47,920
they would start from the beginning,
the name of your mom and dad,

1107
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:49,600
what do they do?
And really flipped the fuck.

1108
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:51,050
Does that have to do anything?
You know?

1109
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:56,070
And I'm just going along with the role 
and it's like the next week I go in for 

1110
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:57,400
another interrogation to start all over 
again to a whole new investigator.

1111
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:58,990
I'm like,
what the fuck's going on?

1112
00:47:58,991 --> 00:48:00,100
I just told the other guy,
you know,

1113
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:05,101
and it got to a point,
it was so bad that I got so frustrated 

1114
00:48:05,101 --> 00:48:05,710
with her as much as I needed to be in 
Japan.

1115
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:06,820
I looked at the guy said,
you know what,

1116
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,500
I love Japan.
I made this place my home and if fucking

1117
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:13,480
dependence and wanted me,
I don't want to fucking be here.

1118
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,110
I told him straight up like that.
And I was like,

1119
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:15,880
I said,
Oh shit,

1120
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:17,800
I just screwed myself now.
But I thought,

1121
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:18,790
you know,
that's so frustrating.

1122
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,720
I can,
you know,

1123
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,050
I served my time,
man and I'm,

1124
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,300
and I'm trying to do,
I'm doing good things for Japan,

1125
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:29,301
you know?
And you guys going to try and kick me 

1126
00:48:29,301 --> 00:48:29,301
out if you guys don't want me,
you know what?

1127
00:48:29,301 --> 00:48:29,320
I don't want to fucking beer for them.
They don't want me here.

1128
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:31,060
You know?
So you know,

1129
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:36,061
the interrogation went on and there was 
one guy that was a phantom way when he 

1130
00:48:36,061 --> 00:48:37,680
was intimidating me and then he,
he,

1131
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,840
he kinda did something illegal where he,
he told me that the,

1132
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:43,300
between these two red marker said 
linking those two papers.

1133
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:48,300
She said he flipped it open.
He said this is all petitions coming in 

1134
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,800
for you not to get kicked out of Japan.
And I saw the papers like this thick.

1135
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:51,430
I was like,
Oh shit,

1136
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:52,240
that's a lot.
He said,

1137
00:48:52,241 --> 00:48:53,620
yeah,
you got like $4,000

1138
00:48:53,621 --> 00:48:55,050
already.
And the petition,

1139
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,190
Japan isn't just names,
you got to live your name,

1140
00:48:57,191 --> 00:49:02,191
your phone number,
your address and everything you see 

1141
00:49:02,191 --> 00:49:05,050
here.
It's not a bullshit where you can just 

1142
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:05,050
get people to sign their names,
just write some.

1143
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:09,810
So they're writing this 4,000
and every time we get an integration I 

1144
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:13,471
see that the,
that between those two red mark is 

1145
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,361
getting thicker and thicker and I come 
to find at the end it came out to be 

1146
00:49:15,361 --> 00:49:16,270
9,008
months.

1147
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:21,271
9,000
people sent in that they don't want me 

1148
00:49:21,271 --> 00:49:23,641
to keep the Japan and immigration is 
there to protect Japan from dangerous 

1149
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:24,490
so-called dangerous foreigners.

1150
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:29,550
So when they're,
there are people that they're supposed 

1151
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,871
to be protecting is sending you 9,000
letters saying they don't want this guy 

1152
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:35,080
kicked out.
So that was the overwhelming thing that 

1153
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,730
I could have been the board idea.
How much press are you getting over 

1154
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,390
there because of all the stuff you're 
doing for Fukushima victims?

1155
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:40,910
Well,
my,

1156
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,960
my movement is Shima isn't like there's 
a lot of celebrities that went up there 

1157
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,480
just once and had a big media thing and 
it was just for like,

1158
00:49:49,481 --> 00:49:50,680
hey look,
look what I'm doing.

1159
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:53,170
But nod people would even know I'm going
up on the 24th.

1160
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:56,560
The day after I get back from here,
I'm driving straight to Fukushima.

1161
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,740
When Nolan radiation like there,
uh,

1162
00:49:59,741 --> 00:50:01,600
the.
I went into the,

1163
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:04,120
um,
into the zone twice or three times.

1164
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:07,680
And the zone,
the zone is,

1165
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,900
it's from the,
where the plants blew up.

1166
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:15,400
It's like a 20 kilometer zone where the 
radiation is actually pretty high,

1167
00:50:15,401 --> 00:50:17,680
although 30 kilometers salt.
Wow.

1168
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,990
But the town that I'm visiting,
nurses or visiting,

1169
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:22,540
the temporary housing is about 80 
kilometers away,

1170
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:24,550
so the radiation's a little higher than 
usual,

1171
00:50:24,551 --> 00:50:26,950
but it's,
if I'm not living there,

1172
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,680
it's not a big deal.

1173
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,730
Chuck,
if you want I can take him.

1174
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,760
I'll take him home because I know you 
wanted to get out of here.

1175
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,190
Say Goodbye to the people.
I know you got your kids at home.

1176
00:50:35,191 --> 00:50:36,630
Thanks for coming by.
Brother are very good.

1177
00:50:36,631 --> 00:50:38,400
Ceos are having anytime,
anytime.

1178
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,530
Come on back.
Mrs.

1179
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,880
Chuck Odell.
Take care.

1180
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,620
She's crashed out.
She's out there on the couch.

1181
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,080
Yeah.
Grab some coconut waters.

1182
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,260
So when you,
when you go in there,

1183
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:54,210
you bring in a geiger counter.
Like how,

1184
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:56,410
how do you know?
Like what your.

1185
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,880
I have a corner and a dusty man.
We'll get you out.

1186
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:00,250
Go see you later man.
Thanks man.

1187
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,030
Yeah,
you have both a geiger counter.

1188
00:51:03,031 --> 00:51:05,280
What's the other thing that Dr Peter,
what's a docile guy?

1189
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,350
Cremator guyer.
Connor.

1190
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:11,380
Co Counsel.
Exactly what you're getting at that 

1191
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,181
moment.
And the dosimeter it takes accumulation 

1192
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:14,181
of which your body is taking him.
Wow.

1193
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:14,190
Yeah.
So,

1194
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,460
um,
take iodine.

1195
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,350
Yeah,
we take that stone tablets.

1196
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:19,800
Yeah.

1197
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,890
Supposedly a protects your thyroid.

1198
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,840
Yeah,
just the steroids.

1199
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:30,580
So.
But I mean for your blood chemistry to 

1200
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,590
change,
you have to take in 65,000

1201
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:36,591
microsieverts and it depends on the wind
and depends on how long you're in the 

1202
00:51:38,311 --> 00:51:43,311
hot spots.
The first time I went in I took in a 

1203
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:47,450
25,000,
which is pretty bad because you're 

1204
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:48,750
talking a yearly count.
You only want $65,000

1205
00:51:48,751 --> 00:51:53,751
after 65,000
and it changes your blood chemistry 

1206
00:51:53,751 --> 00:51:53,751
which could cause cancer.
Let me.

1207
00:51:53,751 --> 00:51:55,800
Yeah,
so then the second time I went and.

1208
00:51:55,801 --> 00:52:00,801
How's this?
I got 19 microsieverts as much as you 

1209
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:00,840
get flying from a trip from Hawaii to 
New York.

1210
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,900
Yeah,
I actually did that.

1211
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:06,480
I brought the dusty meter and in the 
plane.

1212
00:52:06,481 --> 00:52:07,000
The plane.

1213
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:09,970
Yeah.
That's a lot of things that people don't

1214
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:12,220
realize.
Like you get way more radiation from the

1215
00:52:12,221 --> 00:52:14,260
plane that you do from those radar 
detectors.

1216
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,280
There are those metal detectors rather 
when you going through the airport and 

1217
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,280
everybody's terrified of those.

1218
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,900
Yeah.
You just the plane itself probably 

1219
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:22,900
sitting in radiation right now with 
other electrical equipment.

1220
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:27,040
I mean that's what people don't realize 
right now that there's radiation all 

1221
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,831
over.
I mean the sun gives us radiation when 

1222
00:52:29,831 --> 00:52:29,831
it hits the concrete and it bounces back
off.

1223
00:52:29,831 --> 00:52:32,060
It's giving off radiation.
You're getting ration everything you do.

1224
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:33,410
I mean,
you know,

1225
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:36,920
going into Fukushima that second time 
when I got only 19 microsieverts,

1226
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:39,680
it's like getting a,
getting a chest extra now.

1227
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:44,681
Why was it less than.
Because you spent less time where you 

1228
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:46,520
want radiation is actually particles of 
dust.

1229
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:49,190
Yeah,
and it depends on if it rained,

1230
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,810
if turns,
when it rains,

1231
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:53,060
it drains,
it cumulates in a certain area.

1232
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:58,150
It depends if you're in that area.
I mean I can stay right here and see 

1233
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:59,230
zero in the Gardner Corner and walk 10 
feet and get to 100.

1234
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,940
Yeah.
It's like the craziest thing.

1235
00:53:01,941 --> 00:53:03,410
You don't feel it.
You don't see it,

1236
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:05,390
you don't smell it,
you don't feel nothing.

1237
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,360
I mean,
it's ridiculously scary

1238
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:11,390
and the closer to the ground,
the higher the reading.

1239
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:16,391
Right?
I watched a video where a guy took a 

1240
00:53:16,391 --> 00:53:17,160
geiger counter and was showing the air 
and anyone else.

1241
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,400
Yeah,
into the ground,

1242
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,680
stuck on the surfaces even could be on 
glass,

1243
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:23,980
glass.
There's some radiation that gallon glass

1244
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:26,820
and you can't even wash it off.
Developer into glass.

1245
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:31,910
How do you look at nuclear power now?
Do you look at it completely different 

1246
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:35,211
after you've seen that?
It's a hard situation because we don't 

1247
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,470
Nikila power.
Japan wouldn't be able to run or will be

1248
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,800
paying out of our,
our asses in electrical bills.

1249
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,990
I mean,
it's literally can't run without looking

1250
00:53:43,991 --> 00:53:45,260
at your car.
I mean,

1251
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,760
it's important and I don't know,
you know,

1252
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,790
it's a hard thing men,
because an incident like this,

1253
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:51,970
you know,
where um,

1254
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:57,540
the tsunamis come in and I mean,
something like that hasn't happened in 

1255
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,750
100 years in Japan.
So I mean she's,

1256
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,910
it's amazing,
but 100 years ain't shit.

1257
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,430
When you think about the geography and 
think about this,

1258
00:54:05,431 --> 00:54:08,700
the surface of the earth 100 years is 
barely a blink of the night.

1259
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,270
That's what we,
we,

1260
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:15,300
we're so used to what we've seen so far 
in our lifetime when we take that as 

1261
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:16,200
like,
oh,

1262
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:18,420
well this is our point of reference,
this is what we know.

1263
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,130
Don't worry about it.
It's not going to happen.

1264
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,420
It hasn't happened in 100 years.

1265
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,400
That's nothing.
That doesn't mean anything.

1266
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:25,410
A lot of shit can happen.
I mean,

1267
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:27,180
Japan has active volcanoes,
right?

1268
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,740
There's a lot of shit that can go on 
global like eight or nine times a day.

1269
00:54:31,741 --> 00:54:34,260
Man in Japan if we're constantly getting
earthquakes.

1270
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,180
But you love it anyway.
Well,

1271
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,230
I love the people and I love.
I love what I was established there.

1272
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:42,900
I've been there for 22 years.
You know how many gyms you have there?

1273
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,880
I have A.
I have only one gym.

1274
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,110
No,
I actually closed two of them.

1275
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,240
Um,
I have a lot of gyms in Guam.

1276
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,440
I have,
I have a following there that I a big 

1277
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,050
following.
That's like family.

1278
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:59,370
I mean got brothers out there to die,
die for tomorrow,

1279
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:04,371
you know?
So it's something that a lot of them 

1280
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:04,371
can't leave your pants

1281
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:05,590
now when you,
when you first moved there,

1282
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,320
you moved there for racquetball in one 
year?

1283
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,010
Uh,
it was in 1994.

1284
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,530
Wow.
Yeah.

1285
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,520
We 22 years.
Let's calculate that.

1286
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,610
Yeah,
it was way back.

1287
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:20,240
I fought in 1995.
So it was four years before this.

1288
00:55:20,241 --> 00:55:21,270
In 1991.
Actually.

1289
00:55:21,271 --> 00:55:22,620
Nineteen 90.
I think I moved there.

1290
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,390
Wow.
Yeah.

1291
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:29,690
So it was for record.
What tournament did you speak Japanese 

1292
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:29,690
fluently before?
Wow.

1293
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:31,620
I had to learn it with flashcards.
So Holy Shit.

1294
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,070
So in writing and everything and oh,
the writing the Kanji,

1295
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:37,980
I understand it a little bit but it's 
not necessary in my life.

1296
00:55:37,981 --> 00:55:39,510
So I've been learned it.
Yeah.

1297
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:44,540
I mean I teach fighters.
I like shit whenever I did anything I 

1298
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:47,340
thought that I don't read the newspaper.
You can't.

1299
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,380
There's an English newspaper.
So I read that I'm the most conject can 

1300
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:52,950
write is my name.
My address,

1301
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:53,960
Huh?
Yeah.

1302
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:55,730
I can read more than I can.
Right.

1303
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:01,240
Because a whole different thing to be 
able to read it into actually have to 

1304
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,000
write it.
So when you learn how to speak it,

1305
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,970
you just learn by talking to people.
I just learned flashcards and lists,

1306
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:10,420
learn vocabulary just slammed as much 
figure that I thought I would using as 

1307
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:11,550
far as the particles,
I just let it flow.

1308
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,930
Wow.
So speaking pretty much just vocabulary.

1309
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,940
When you communicate in Japan now,
did they know it's like,

1310
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:25,380
you know,
you hear like Boron Talk English and he 

1311
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:25,380
has a Kazakhstan

1312
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,340
accent.
Did they hear an American accent for 

1313
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:29,340
your Japanese?
Really?

1314
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,100
I mean if you hear me treat shopper 
needs,

1315
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,510
you probably think I'm fluent but 
considering our bidding for 20 years,

1316
00:56:34,511 --> 00:56:39,511
I suck really.
I'm a fluent as far as I can 

1317
00:56:39,511 --> 00:56:42,720
communicate.
I have no problem communicating and I 

1318
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,780
never misunderstanding anything is 
pretty understanding everything.

1319
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:48,781
But it's not fluent.
How much of your communicating over 

1320
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:49,660
there as English speaking?
Almost zero.

1321
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,520
Almost zero.
It's all Japanese.

1322
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:56,830
Wow.
How many different fighters are you 

1323
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:56,830
working with,
Don?

1324
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,270
I know you were working with kids for 
awhile.

1325
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,150
He's still working with him.
No,

1326
00:56:59,350 --> 00:56:59,980
no,
no.

1327
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,350
We had a falling on with.
Yeah,

1328
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:02,440
his,
his,

1329
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:05,980
his idea of loyalty is a whole different
thing.

1330
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:09,580
I mean,
he was a super fucking talented guy,

1331
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:11,080
you know that kid,
man,

1332
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:16,081
he's,
he's a super athlete and all he needed 

1333
00:57:16,081 --> 00:57:18,841
was something behind him that he felt 
confident with where he would have his 

1334
00:57:18,841 --> 00:57:18,841
confidence when he has.

1335
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,220
When a kid has his head on,
right?

1336
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:22,140
Man,
nobody can beat him,

1337
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,810
but that guy,
they kind of can be broken.

1338
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:30,811
Man.
I seen him break so many times and he 

1339
00:57:30,811 --> 00:57:33,091
needs that something behind him that 
gives him that little extra confidence 

1340
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:35,260
that pushes them past that barrier,
but he doesn't have it.

1341
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:40,261
No ma'am.
This superbad because when in his prime 

1342
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:43,111
he was a,
just a stunning athlete when were 

1343
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:46,181
talking about a guy who entered into a 
kickboxing bow with Masato and dropped 

1344
00:57:46,181 --> 00:57:50,230
him when he was a wrestler essentially,
you know,

1345
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:54,400
and he's fighting one against one of the
best Japanese kickboxers of all times.

1346
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,890
He was there the whole time when he 
first came in from wrestling.

1347
00:57:56,891 --> 00:58:01,891
I mean,
he's defending Jujitsu moves just being 

1348
00:58:01,891 --> 00:58:01,891
a restaurant,
not even understanding.

1349
00:58:01,891 --> 00:58:04,520
It's just on a natural instinct,
which you don't see much in wrestling.

1350
00:58:04,521 --> 00:58:09,521
And arresting has this bad habits of 
stretching their arms all using their 

1351
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:09,521
arms and getting locked up a lot.

1352
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:12,760
But he was just sobbing,
was defending from the arm bars,

1353
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:15,280
took him to Thailand and he started 
picking on the standing right away.

1354
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,030
I mean the guy was natural.
It was a confidence thing and kid.

1355
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,890
I mean,
I still think he has it today,

1356
00:58:20,891 --> 00:58:23,200
but he just doesn't have that.
That confidence.

1357
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,500
Yeah.
When he first fought in the UFC against 

1358
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,751
a kid,
Yamamoto and then against or against a 

1359
00:58:30,751 --> 00:58:30,751
brother,
Demetrius Johnson.

1360
00:58:30,751 --> 00:58:32,800
And then against Vaughn Lee.
I was telling everybody,

1361
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:33,280
I was like,
man,

1362
00:58:33,281 --> 00:58:38,281
wait till you see this guy.
But then by the time he got into the 

1363
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,651
UFC,
he had already lost some of his 

1364
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:40,651
momentum.
Lost some of its fire.

1365
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:44,420
Yeah.
You know the fire that he had when he 

1366
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:44,420
knocked out Hoya,
Gracie or the father that he had when he

1367
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,720
was in his fucking shit.
Oh Man.

1368
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:50,040
He was a bad motherfucker when he was in
his prime was like,

1369
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,610
you know,
he,

1370
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,200
he was just a freak.

1371
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:58,310
Just a real unusual athlete.
And I feel I know what's missing in 

1372
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:58,310
them,
you know what I mean?

1373
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:58,840
If I went and started training with 
them,

1374
00:58:58,841 --> 00:59:00,030
I could get right back.
I'd be there,

1375
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,360
I can get them right back to what he 
was.

1376
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:06,361
But I don't want to deal with the father
and I don't want to be with the loyalty 

1377
00:59:06,361 --> 00:59:10,651
issues that he runs a shall issue.
What is the state of Japanese MMA now?

1378
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:15,220
It was gigantic for awhile when Soccer 
Rabo was big.

1379
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:18,610
When you were huge.
When pride was filling 90,000

1380
00:59:18,611 --> 00:59:20,410
seat arenas.
Huge.

1381
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,960
It was like nothing else.

1382
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:27,820
So like I experienced 60,000
at Rogers in Canada when George St 

1383
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:32,320
Pierre fought jake shields.
I couldn't imagine 30 more thousand 

1384
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,110
people there.
But you were there for that.

1385
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:39,060
It was awesome.
I mean if that was a 10 and before we 

1386
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,960
may actually came out when they were 
only had pancreas and that was a one.

1387
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,320
It said like a Ford.
Right now what happened is Yakuza 

1388
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:46,810
involvement.
I mean,

1389
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,910
the thing that people don't realize is 
in Japan,

1390
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,910
everything is Ya'lls involvement.
Every big company,

1391
00:59:51,911 --> 00:59:54,210
every big promotion shooto chose to say 
that.

1392
00:59:54,211 --> 00:59:56,660
Didn't ever get a yuck his involvement,
but they're there.

1393
00:59:56,890 --> 01:00:01,890
They're backed Subito shoe,
which is the second largest group of 

1394
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:01,890
Japan,
you know,

1395
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,760
so everyone has yakuza connections to 
any big Coca Cola company.

1396
01:00:03,761 --> 01:00:08,761
Johnson and Johnson.
Any company has yet because the 

1397
01:00:08,761 --> 01:00:08,761
connections.
Wow.

1398
01:00:08,761 --> 01:00:09,190
But it's not public.

1399
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:13,670
So say if Coca Cola goes over there and 
they open up a plant in Japan,

1400
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,680
they must go through the Yakuza.

1401
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,720
They will have that connections.
Yes,

1402
01:00:17,721 --> 01:00:19,670
definitely.
How do they negotiate that?

1403
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,320
Well,
it's really easy.

1404
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:21,660
It's,
it's,

1405
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:23,510
it's,
it's a turf thing.

1406
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:25,010
It's a.
If you know somebody,

1407
01:00:25,011 --> 01:00:25,870
it's,
it's,

1408
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:30,560
it's a percentage of pay.
It's pretty given thing.

1409
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:32,900
It's almost like taxes.
Wow.

1410
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,310
Yeah.
Pink accepted,

1411
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:35,900
accepted,
accepted.

1412
01:00:35,901 --> 01:00:38,690
That's why it's.
It's funny how when it became public,

1413
01:00:38,691 --> 01:00:41,980
everyone,
it got really bad because it's a,

1414
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:45,350
it's a weird thing is accepted,
but it's frowned upon.

1415
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,280
It's something that they know they need 
to be a part of in society,

1416
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,150
but they don't want to make it public 
because the Oculus has,

1417
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,050
does have a bad name.

1418
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,330
That was the only place where I've ever 
been with a.

1419
01:00:56,331 --> 01:01:00,440
asked me to cover up my tattoos.
It was weird,

1420
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:02,060
that's why I try to keep them out

1421
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:05,330
from my sleep so it comes up from here,
but after that I stopped because I don't

1422
01:01:05,331 --> 01:01:08,630
want to walk around and you know,
be kicked out of places,

1423
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:13,631
you know,
you just got denied to go in a hotel 

1424
01:01:13,631 --> 01:01:13,631
like last week when I was in Japan.
Really?

1425
01:01:13,631 --> 01:01:14,300
Yeah.
Because of my tattoos

1426
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,460
with the neck.
Is that what it is?

1427
01:01:16,461 --> 01:01:18,700
Yeah,
they saw the Hoodie.

1428
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:21,680
It covers it up.
It helps me.

1429
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,610
Yeah.
I got A.

1430
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:27,620
I got kicked out of a gym.
They made me go put a long sleeve shirt 

1431
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,790
on the gyms.
Big Gyms at Gold's gym on the chair.

1432
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,320
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1433
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,630
What is it represented?
Japanese.

1434
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,090
It

1435
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:38,090
represents the underworld.
Gangsters and you've got to figure when 

1436
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:41,550
you have a gang,
there's two or three top men.

1437
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:46,730
Those men are awesome people and then 
you got the rest of the hundreds and 

1438
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:48,210
thousands that are punks and that's the 
ones that you see.

1439
01:01:48,211 --> 01:01:51,910
So basically a gangster,
someone with tattoos which equals Yakuza

1440
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,960
would mean trouble and they would.
If you go into sports gym and you're 

1441
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,010
working out next to a guy and you know 
you're,

1442
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:05,020
you're working on say you take his 
weights by oxen casino in the middle of 

1443
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:05,730
the set and if you're doing it to 
someone that's a normal person,

1444
01:02:05,731 --> 01:02:06,300
he'll just say,
hey,

1445
01:02:06,301 --> 01:02:07,500
I was using those ways.
Oh sorry.

1446
01:02:07,501 --> 01:02:12,501
Okay,
well it might be different for the 

1447
01:02:12,501 --> 01:02:14,130
Yakuza and people would rather not work 
out in the area if there's a guy working

1448
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:16,350
on there.
So it's a bad rap.

1449
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,980
I mean it's justifiable though.
I can that the

1450
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,050
UFC,
when they went in and bought pride,

1451
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:25,080
it's kind of a crazy story,
but they paid $65,

1452
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:27,330
million dollars.
They bought pride and they thought,

1453
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:27,810
you know,
hey,

1454
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:32,811
we're going to run pride as well as the 
UFC the same way they did with 

1455
01:02:32,811 --> 01:02:33,390
strikeforce when they bought 
strikeforce.

1456
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,780
They kept strikeforce going for years.
They thought they were going to do that,

1457
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:40,830
but meanwhile it turned out all of their
contracts are illegal.

1458
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,350
They really didn't have anybody under 
contract.

1459
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:48,380
They spent $65 million in.
All they really got was a video library 

1460
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:53,270
and then while they had offices in Japan
and they were hiring these people and 

1461
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:57,291
painful and they were starting up dream,
they were starting up their own 

1462
01:02:57,291 --> 01:02:57,900
organization,
organizing everything and yeah.

1463
01:02:57,901 --> 01:02:59,590
And then,
you know,

1464
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:04,700
the UFC,
it took years before they could come 

1465
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,560
back and do it.
UFC there they took,

1466
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:06,690
it took a long time.

1467
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,100
Dana was getting like some like,
underworld threats and you know,

1468
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,040
running.
Yeah,

1469
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:12,080
that's,
that's what I heard.

1470
01:03:12,081 --> 01:03:15,500
I sorry I sent an email on that because 
if anything I have a lot of pulling that

1471
01:03:15,501 --> 01:03:19,070
side and I told him that if you have any
problems with that I can help you.

1472
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:22,320
What would he have to do?
Come to you and then you go to

1473
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,890
directed in that world.
So,

1474
01:03:24,891 --> 01:03:26,030
um,
I could,

1475
01:03:26,031 --> 01:03:27,920
I,
if I don't know the person directly,

1476
01:03:27,921 --> 01:03:31,310
I have guys at home.
So if he had any type of problem,

1477
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:32,750
I still,
it still stands today.

1478
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:35,120
If Dana has any type of underworld 
problems there,

1479
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,130
if he calls me,
I take care of it for them.

1480
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:42,510
It's interesting that there's such an 
underworld presence in Japan because it 

1481
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:43,420
seems so safe when you're there.
Everything is so.

1482
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:46,450
People are so polite and you don't see 
violence.

1483
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:50,080
You don't see like you see drunk people 
walking into the street and no one hurts

1484
01:03:50,081 --> 01:03:50,680
them.
Everything.

1485
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:51,450
Everyone's fine.

1486
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,900
Walk down dark lanes and this.
Okay.

1487
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:58,420
Yeah.
It's a strange sort of contrast.

1488
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:01,680
It's almost like you just have bad 
areas.

1489
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,270
They can change it.
They have over 300 yards.

1490
01:04:05,271 --> 01:04:07,290
Was offices there?
Roppongi only has three.

1491
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,660
Wow.
Yeah.

1492
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:13,670
So you got,
these are districts that their 

1493
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:13,670
accumulated in.
They have offices,

1494
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:13,860
they have offices.

1495
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,150
The Mafia doesn't El Office.
See that's the thing for

1496
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,650
me,
I guess I grew up in America.

1497
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:22,440
So for me the mafia just scares me way 
more.

1498
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:22,950
I mean,
I,

1499
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,050
I have this image that you screw it,
the mafia,

1500
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:28,080
you better change your name,
you were to move and you better hide who

1501
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:30,690
your family is and you better get the 
hell out of just disappear.

1502
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:34,140
But when you get in trouble with the 
Yakuza um,

1503
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:36,030
I've been in trouble with them before 
and it's,

1504
01:04:36,031 --> 01:04:41,031
it's,
it's like you can kind of pretty much 

1505
01:04:41,031 --> 01:04:41,031
deal with them the way you want to deal 
with them,

1506
01:04:41,031 --> 01:04:42,900
you know,
it depends on how much you're willing to

1507
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:46,800
sacrifice and for what was your issue 
with them?

1508
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:49,050
Um,
there was a wonder kid,

1509
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:50,610
um,
when,

1510
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:53,100
when I,
this guy,

1511
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:58,130
this young guy who wanted to open up a 
gym and I agreed to open up a gym with 

1512
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:02,331
him called purebred Tokyo killer bee and
I just told them that only thing you 

1513
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:07,551
have to do is you have to hire two of my
fighters so they can make a living 

1514
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:07,551
through fighting.

1515
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:08,730
And I wanted to help them out.
I want no money.

1516
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,640
He can use my name or my gym,
but you have to hire my two fighters.

1517
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:16,670
He,
they acquired kid and they're hardwired 

1518
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:16,670
and bowl and those are the fighters and 
everything was good.

1519
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:21,291
And what happened was kids started,
I guess from the influence of his 

1520
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:22,000
father.
He started being,

1521
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:27,250
the loyalty issue in him was getting was
wavering where he wasn't telling me 

1522
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:27,700
stuff,
he was hiding stuff.

1523
01:05:27,701 --> 01:05:32,701
He's lying to me and then I put that was
the guy in charge of them that ran the 

1524
01:05:32,701 --> 01:05:33,160
gym.
So I told him,

1525
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:34,170
I called him and say,
what?

1526
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:39,210
What's going on man?
You gotta take care of it because I'll 

1527
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:39,210
take care of her.
I take care of.

1528
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:40,210
He's told me that and it got to a point 
he didn't take care of it.

1529
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,190
So I called him and I was pissed 30 by 
now and I called him and said,

1530
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:45,570
you know what?

1531
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:48,010
Call me.
He avoided my calls for three days,

1532
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:48,930
so three,
three,

1533
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:50,910
three weeks.
And I'm sitting there,

1534
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:53,590
this guy to running from me.
I'm thinking this is ridiculous.

1535
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:54,670
So the,
okay,

1536
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:56,410
this guy's running from me,
I'm not going to look for them.

1537
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:01,460
I'm going to.
He's going to pop up is these guys had 

1538
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:01,460
charter to run their pop up all the 
time,

1539
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:05,341
you know.
So I'm sitting there watching the Uno 

1540
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:06,490
kid flight and kid wins a fight and this
guy's in the ring jumping and hug him.

1541
01:06:06,491 --> 01:06:08,880
And theme as a mother fucker.
This is hiding from me.

1542
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,740
He's on national TV hugging me saying 
Hansen,

1543
01:06:11,741 --> 01:06:14,140
I'm here.
So I guess is it.

1544
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:18,550
So I called my students until the final 
where the after party is adulthood after

1545
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:23,551
part now is literally going to walk in 
there and grab that guy with the hair 

1546
01:06:23,551 --> 01:06:23,551
and pull them out with party.

1547
01:06:23,551 --> 01:06:25,060
But my students felt he was going to be 
a problem,

1548
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:27,520
is going to be too much commotion.
Cops are going to be called.

1549
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:32,521
So they decide to get them in.
They brought them up and brought him to 

1550
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:33,790
the park and pretty much beat him for 
like 20 minutes,

1551
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:38,791
which is something he shouldn't do in 
Japan because in the Yakuza world they 

1552
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:39,480
work by face.
They work by being tough,

1553
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:44,510
being scary to collect money and stuff.
And if you've got all got a black guy 

1554
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:48,571
and bruises on her face is kind of goes 
against the fact that they're tough 

1555
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:48,571
people,
you know?

1556
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:52,450
So I beat him up pretty bad and I did.
But see,

1557
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:57,451
the thing is I never did pick on anyone.
I never did do anything without a 

1558
01:06:57,451 --> 01:07:01,021
reason.
And I believe that I would die for my 

1559
01:07:01,021 --> 01:07:03,721
beliefs tomorrow and I believed that I 
was right and this guy really deserved 

1560
01:07:03,721 --> 01:07:03,721
that shit.

1561
01:07:03,721 --> 01:07:07,150
So if they didn't like it,
if the top guys didn't like it,

1562
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:08,950
then they can.
They know where to find me.

1563
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:13,951
And so what happened was it was going on
for 20 minutes and when I went down I 

1564
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:15,080
let people in,
some people,

1565
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:16,720
all my friends know and they're all 
worried.

1566
01:07:16,721 --> 01:07:21,721
So they made calls and we had two other 
Yakuza guys come down to the scene to 

1567
01:07:21,721 --> 01:07:23,470
try and stop me,
to kind of get in between,

1568
01:07:23,471 --> 01:07:26,130
not stop me physically but to,
to,

1569
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:31,220
to ask for forgiveness for this guy.
And they're kind of like bawling in the 

1570
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:35,520
middle of me and the guy that I'm 
getting around and just giving them wax 

1571
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:35,520
at a time.
And when he,

1572
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:40,020
if he were to fall from a hit,
I'd grab them and standing right back 

1573
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:40,020
up.
Oh.

1574
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:40,570
So yeah.
So it's kind of getting really.

1575
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:41,290
He was all bloody.

1576
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:44,770
And then these guys are kind of my 
friends too.

1577
01:07:44,771 --> 01:07:46,300
So they,
they weren't going to get involved with.

1578
01:07:46,301 --> 01:07:50,200
They're trying to stop me from going too
far and when we,

1579
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:55,470
there's this old lady,
you know how you have the old ladies in 

1580
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:55,470
the neighborhood that don't give a fuck 
who you are.

1581
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:59,460
She,
this lady comes on and starts screaming 

1582
01:07:59,460 --> 01:07:59,830
at us that it gets on the lady and I 
say,

1583
01:07:59,831 --> 01:08:00,130
no,
no,

1584
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,900
I don't do that man.
Let's go.

1585
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:04,930
So he moved over to the next part and as
you're moving on with the next part,

1586
01:08:04,931 --> 01:08:09,931
like three African monkeys disguise 
higher ups to find out what's happening 

1587
01:08:09,931 --> 01:08:11,170
and come out and they're walking up like
these,

1588
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:12,960
you know,
like the movies they walking I,

1589
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:18,130
it was funny because I call them monkeys
because they're walking through bushes 

1590
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:19,440
and the trees and they came out and 
saying,

1591
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,950
Oh shit,
these are the guys,

1592
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,360
the hothead guys.

1593
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,090
And they came up to me and they're 
screaming and Japanese to me,

1594
01:08:25,091 --> 01:08:30,091
Oh you were going to hurt you and 
because you heard our brother and then 

1595
01:08:30,091 --> 01:08:32,190
some of my guys came and held him back 
and I was like,

1596
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:32,970
okay,
wait a minute.

1597
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,230
If it's gonna happen is gonna happen 
now.

1598
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:37,450
So I told my guys,
let him go.

1599
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:38,290
I said,
let him go.

1600
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:43,291
I said,
I just want to say one thing to you 

1601
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:43,291
guys,
and the,

1602
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:43,291
the,
they came up and they're all there,

1603
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:44,620
you know,
they got this stance and they're all mad

1604
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:45,940
at me and looking at me and I'm looking 
to see.

1605
01:08:45,941 --> 01:08:48,100
I got one thing to do.
If I got one thing to say,

1606
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:50,350
if I say you don't like it,
we can have it all.

1607
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:51,640
I said,
I'm ready to die tonight.

1608
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:52,880
And then this guy goes,
okay.

1609
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:53,770
So I tell them,
okay,

1610
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:56,110
if someone fucked you over,
I said,

1611
01:08:56,111 --> 01:08:56,890
you want to punish them?

1612
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,510
Wouldn't that be fair?
He goes,

1613
01:08:58,511 --> 01:09:00,040
yes,
but look what you did to him.

1614
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:01,170
Look at him.
The kiddies,

1615
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,650
all blood.
He's standing here all bloody.

1616
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:04,090
And I said,
well,

1617
01:09:04,091 --> 01:09:05,300
you know what,
let's put it this way.

1618
01:09:05,301 --> 01:09:08,500
I'll just ask you one question if flying
to kill him with my hands,

1619
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:09,970
how fast you think I could do it?
He said,

1620
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,310
probably five minutes within five 
minutes.

1621
01:09:12,311 --> 01:09:12,810
I said,
hell,

1622
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:14,830
within two minutes I killed that fucker.
And he goes,

1623
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:17,590
yeah,
but what does that mean?

1624
01:09:17,591 --> 01:09:18,250
And I said,
well,

1625
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:21,290
I human hitting him for 20 minutes.
I said,

1626
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:21,990
dude,
this is,

1627
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:24,460
this is like 10 percent of what I could 
do.

1628
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:27,370
And I said,
don't you agree for you what you.

1629
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:32,550
If you had somebody fuck you over and 
you decide to just do 10 percent out of 

1630
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:35,200
respect to the people behind him,
wouldn't you think that's fair?

1631
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:38,560
And they guy just changed straight up.
Bill stopped and he said,

1632
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:40,780
you're right man.
Thank you.

1633
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:42,650
Wow.
That doesn't fly in America.

1634
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:46,310
That's interesting.
Interesting Code.

1635
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:51,810
The believe in the underworld side is 
there's two sides of the fences,

1636
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:54,900
the legal side of the illegal side,
the legitimate site,

1637
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,300
and you are never,
ever,

1638
01:09:57,301 --> 01:09:59,390
if you're in the illegitimate cider,
have a legitimate problem.

1639
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:04,410
You are never ever allowed to go to the 
other site to get help you.

1640
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,960
If you're going gonna stay,
you're going to get other guys to help 

1641
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:09,960
you with this site and retaliate,
that's fine.

1642
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,570
But if you ever go to authorities and 
you lose face and you can never can 

1643
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:14,570
never work in that world again.
So

1644
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:21,070
wow.
So you have to deal with things on your 

1645
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:21,070
own

1646
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:21,070
that,
yeah,

1647
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:22,560
you pretty much if,
if you,

1648
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:27,610
if you're someone from the outside and 
you're like a regular businessman and 

1649
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:31,211
these guys come and bother you,
the best thing to do is go to the 

1650
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:34,261
authorities because of the,
the police are just waiting to grab the 

1651
01:10:34,261 --> 01:10:34,960
buses.
So He's psycho role.

1652
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,550
It's like Kryptonite to the adolescence.
If you go say you're going to the police

1653
01:10:37,551 --> 01:10:40,510
still back off.
But if I,

1654
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,880
I live my life in that side pretty much,
you know what I mean?

1655
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:49,420
A lot of my friends are part of those 
groups and a lot of my beliefs run 

1656
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:51,800
really deep with their beliefs.
You know,

1657
01:10:51,801 --> 01:10:52,490
the.
I mean,

1658
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:53,510
see,
the thing is,

1659
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:58,511
is you,
you and you hear about the Yakuza they 

1660
01:10:58,511 --> 01:10:58,511
get a bad rap because you talk about 
child pornography,

1661
01:10:58,511 --> 01:10:59,330
drugs,
you know,

1662
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,610
extortion.
Um,

1663
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,620
what is that?
Uh,

1664
01:11:02,621 --> 01:11:04,970
when they,
when they steal money from people,

1665
01:11:04,971 --> 01:11:08,140
you know,
but the thing that they don't see that's

1666
01:11:08,141 --> 01:11:09,410
uh,
that's all the things in the media,

1667
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,040
but the things that they don't see,
which I feel is a really unfortunate.

1668
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:18,290
The honor and the loyalty they have for 
each other and that's where me and then 

1669
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:18,290
click really well,
you know,

1670
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:23,230
I mean they will die for anyone that 
tomorrow they'll go to jail for 10 years

1671
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:26,820
for their boss tomorrow if they have to.
I mean,

1672
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:29,250
you don't see that type of loyalty 
around all these,

1673
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:31,700
you know,
non America and I love that.

1674
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,250
I think that loyalty,
you know,

1675
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:34,950
and they.
And that's,

1676
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:36,640
I think that's why they respect me so 
much as you.

1677
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:39,630
I will die for my values.
I'll die for my people that are close to

1678
01:11:39,631 --> 01:11:44,631
me.
It's just such an unbelievably 

1679
01:11:44,631 --> 01:11:45,530
fascinating culture.
How different Japan is in so many ways.

1680
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:46,950
It could be.
There's big gaps in it.

1681
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:48,540
Yeah,
it's crazy.

1682
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:49,830
It's really,
really,

1683
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:54,831
really fascinating stuff.
It's just that all these different 

1684
01:11:54,831 --> 01:11:58,850
cultures evolve independently,
that the Japanese culture evolved 

1685
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:03,441
independently from the American culture 
independently from the European culture 

1686
01:12:03,441 --> 01:12:03,441
and it's so different.

1687
01:12:03,441 --> 01:12:07,780
Yeah,
it is all you think all the places are 

1688
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:07,780
different,
man.

1689
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:09,911
It's hard to really move into a 
different country and run yourself in 

1690
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:13,460
the way that you learned in another 
country because it's,

1691
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:14,410
you know,

1692
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:19,730
when enrollment is,
what do you think about the state of 

1693
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:23,210
Japanese mma right now because it's kind
of in a transitionary period if one at 

1694
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:27,471
one point in time it was gigantic and 
you say Yakuza involvement is why 

1695
01:12:27,471 --> 01:12:31,610
people,
corporate sponsors backed out and then 

1696
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:32,250
they lost a lot of viewership.
But man,

1697
01:12:32,251 --> 01:12:36,840
it was jet not that long ago that they 
were selling out these gigantic places.

1698
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:39,430
What,
what's going on right now or

1699
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,370
right now?
I'm,

1700
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,270
like I said,
it's under number four right now.

1701
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:47,390
Just people that are real hesitant.
They're not many sponsors that want to 

1702
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:47,460
put money into it.
Um,

1703
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:52,850
on the flip side,
the big things that's happening is 

1704
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:53,670
gangster events where they allow 
gangsters to fight in the ring.

1705
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:55,530
And yeah,
it's crazy,

1706
01:12:55,531 --> 01:12:57,600
dude.
It's like I attended all of those.

1707
01:12:57,601 --> 01:13:02,601
I'm like a guest and most of them they 
pay me to just to be there and to judge 

1708
01:13:02,601 --> 01:13:06,021
sometimes to make a speech in that ring.
Maybe in the beginning because I'm so 

1709
01:13:06,021 --> 01:13:07,170
respected in that world that to have me 
there,

1710
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,100
a lot of these gangsters toned down,
you know,

1711
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,560
when they want to riot,
they don't riot,

1712
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:15,620
you know,
I mean you go to the event and it's not 

1713
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:18,260
unusual to see a picture of two stick 
figures fighting and has a big 

1714
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:18,510
excellent.
So dark.

1715
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,570
Don't fight.
Isn't that given?

1716
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:26,630
You've never seen any signs of the UFC 
saying please don't fight in the 

1717
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:26,940
audience is like,
it's already given this.

1718
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:29,010
Not something you should do,
but yeah,

1719
01:13:29,011 --> 01:13:34,011
so that's a big thing right now,
but it's good because the gangster 

1720
01:13:34,011 --> 01:13:34,380
events,
actually they,

1721
01:13:34,381 --> 01:13:35,800
they,
they have headbutts,

1722
01:13:35,801 --> 01:13:38,870
they have elbow striking.
You can split Stom,

1723
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,220
you can need the groin,
you can do whatever.

1724
01:13:41,221 --> 01:13:44,520
Pretty much they have to on one.
They have to one tool.

1725
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,320
Really.
It's crazy though.

1726
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,660
How often do they have these funds on 
the bowl?

1727
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:51,060
Once a month now there's some shit.
Yeah,

1728
01:13:51,061 --> 01:13:53,790
and it's like these guys,
it's become,

1729
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:58,800
it's a good trend because it's become 
where these guys just came off the 

1730
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,821
streets singing.
They're tough gassing on in one minute 

1731
01:14:01,821 --> 01:14:01,821
from these guys.
Actually spending time in the gym though

1732
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:04,260
and being off the street.
So it's a good movement.

1733
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:09,840
A lot of.
There's about three or four gangsters 

1734
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:09,840
already.
Now this,

1735
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,450
she made their pro debut in deep.
Wow.

1736
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:16,500
These guys are actually gonna run gangs 
and start selling drugs and doing 

1737
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,940
illegal activity.
They're not training and having a future

1738
01:14:18,941 --> 01:14:20,050
in fighting,
which is awesome.

1739
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,740
As far as the legitimate side of mma,
I,

1740
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,880
I see it.
I can see it picking up again and it's 

1741
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,211
all due to the UFC.
And the UFC has done a couple of events 

1742
01:14:30,211 --> 01:14:32,350
there now in the last one they did that 
when I went to that,

1743
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:33,340
it was huge.
Man,

1744
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:34,480
that's so big.
I mean,

1745
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:40,470
as much as the Japanese fans are kind of
losing hope in Japanese mma because a 

1746
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:42,580
lot of productions were folding.
Um,

1747
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,110
when the,
when we went to,

1748
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,910
when I went to the USC,
uh,

1749
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,270
I felt that that energy again,
when I was fighting in pride,

1750
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:54,271
that energy that they had in the 
audience and especially when rampage 

1751
01:14:54,271 --> 01:14:57,631
came out with the pride music,
it gave me goosebumps because when he 

1752
01:14:57,631 --> 01:15:01,201
came out to that,
I looked around the arena and I was 

1753
01:15:01,201 --> 01:15:01,201
like,
damn,

1754
01:15:01,201 --> 01:15:01,201
this is a psycho pride.
This is a,

1755
01:15:01,201 --> 01:15:02,790
this is a pride.
And it,

1756
01:15:02,791 --> 01:15:07,791
I,
it's the first time since that big 

1757
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:09,901
incident with the Yakuza will vomit and 
pride that I've actually seen that 

1758
01:15:09,901 --> 01:15:09,901
again.
It,

1759
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:13,060
it was surreal to me actually.
And I was like,

1760
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:13,770
damn,
this is gonna.

1761
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:17,350
This is going to be the ticket back.
Is the UFC coming to Japan?

1762
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:22,310
If the UFC did an ultimate fighter in 
Japan and Japanese version of it,

1763
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:23,750
would you be interested in coaching?

1764
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,510
Oh yeah.
Oh definitely.

1765
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:27,670
Yeah.
I would love to.

1766
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,980
That would be perfect.
You'd be,

1767
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:31,840
you would really be perfect for 
something like,

1768
01:15:31,841 --> 01:15:32,980
yeah,
I would love that.

1769
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:33,370
You know,

1770
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:39,140
I hope they do it because you know,
they're starting to do that in other 

1771
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:39,140
countries.
Now.

1772
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:41,781
You saw they did in Australia,
smashes the Brazilian show mean it's a 

1773
01:15:41,781 --> 01:15:43,020
natural for it eventually to go to 
Japan.

1774
01:15:43,021 --> 01:15:43,350
Right?

1775
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:44,860
Yeah.
It's probably inevitable.

1776
01:15:44,861 --> 01:15:45,480
Yeah,
someday.

1777
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,920
Wow.
So as far as like Japanese,

1778
01:15:48,921 --> 01:15:53,921
like standouts,
obviously probably one of the bigger 

1779
01:15:53,931 --> 01:15:55,160
guys right now.
Right.

1780
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,380
And how,
what?

1781
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,580
Who were the other guys that are coming 
up that you see?

1782
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:03,610
I like Ricky Fukuda bias.
Good.

1783
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:09,130
I used to train with them so I'm a 
little biased in that very good 

1784
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:09,480
wrestling and the guy's still young.
He's a real hungry.

1785
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:14,500
I think he just needs someone in the 
corner to keep that killer instinct 

1786
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,970
going because he's such.
Yeah.

1787
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,090
And he's such a nice guy.
I mean it's,

1788
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,670
you got to convince this guy to,
this guy is going to try and hurt you.

1789
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,670
Got To hurt him first,
you know,

1790
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:28,300
so he has that little titty beers 
instead of him that has got to be 

1791
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,350
ignited the gotta get get,
get that on and get the grizzly on.

1792
01:16:30,351 --> 01:16:32,360
You know?
So yeah,

1793
01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:33,530
he's going to be a good fighter.

1794
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,020
What about a hot so hot.
So He.

1795
01:16:36,021 --> 01:16:36,370
Okay.

1796
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:37,420
Yeah.
He's.

1797
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,040
He's already good.
Very good.

1798
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:39,820
Yeah,
he's awesome.

1799
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:41,480
I thought it will be call.
It's going to do better too.

1800
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:45,570
Yeah.
One guy was some tough breaks.

1801
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:47,220
Yeah,
he had some bad calls,

1802
01:16:47,221 --> 01:16:48,210
but he,
he actually,

1803
01:16:48,211 --> 01:16:53,211
the last one he actually did really 
loose and it was a week I was going to 

1804
01:16:53,211 --> 01:16:53,211
do something.

1805
01:16:53,211 --> 01:16:53,740
Well,
it's also,

1806
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:56,800
oh my God,
I was at the tail end of a long career.

1807
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:57,980
Yeah,
that's true.

1808
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:02,540
How many years do you think our guy can 
compete at a fate or level four?

1809
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:07,570
I mean,
there's only a certain amount of years 

1810
01:17:07,570 --> 01:17:10,080
where your body can kind of red line at 
those high and

1811
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,060
keep it going when you were like top

1812
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,410
form.
It'll all depend on the fighter.

1813
01:17:14,411 --> 01:17:15,570
I believe.
Like some,

1814
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,680
like afraid to like me.
I think maybe five,

1815
01:17:17,681 --> 01:17:22,681
six years of the fighter that goes in 
there training with everything he has 

1816
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,620
and,
and willing to die in the ring.

1817
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:28,770
I mean not being not accepting the fact 
that my,

1818
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:31,720
but fighting with the will to die.
It's a whole different thing,

1819
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:37,110
but then you've got another fight like 
Sakuraba schools in there and takes a 

1820
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:40,531
fight in two days and it's just having 
fun and does this smoke entrance coming 

1821
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:42,010
in with this riding a scooter and you 
know,

1822
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,410
actually literally having fun in the 
fight,

1823
01:17:44,411 --> 01:17:46,360
you know,
it's first can go on forever,

1824
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:46,600
you know?

1825
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:48,920
Yeah.
Sakharova man,

1826
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:51,640
that guy is.
Had some incredible finding.

1827
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,170
That guy's got to retire though.
He's going to eat too much.

1828
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:59,171
Hits the Melvin manhoef fight was 
fucking scary when Melvin manhoef was 

1829
01:17:59,171 --> 01:17:59,210
beating on him.
He like,

1830
01:17:59,211 --> 01:18:04,211
man,
he doesn't need that at this stage in 

1831
01:18:04,211 --> 01:18:04,211
his life.
He's done so much for the sport.

1832
01:18:04,211 --> 01:18:04,211
I mean,
they think he should.

1833
01:18:04,211 --> 01:18:09,190
You know,
you don't want to do another mom and 

1834
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:09,190
Alia.
Yeah.

1835
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:12,461
There's been so many.
This has been so many beat downs and 

1836
01:18:12,461 --> 01:18:12,740
he's had like in the later stages of his
career,

1837
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,850
you got to really look at a guy like 
that,

1838
01:18:14,851 --> 01:18:18,320
like mail,
but its ability to absorb punishment.

1839
01:18:18,321 --> 01:18:19,820
It's fucking shocking.
Yeah.

1840
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,980
It's unbelievable,
man.

1841
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,640
The one that freaked me out was the,
um,

1842
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:29,270
the Nino,
El Nino and that it was weird.

1843
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:31,850
It's not the same stuff.
I think he's been taking too much hits.

1844
01:18:31,851 --> 01:18:33,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

1845
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:34,600
Well,
there's no question.

1846
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:35,380
Yeah,
I mean,

1847
01:18:35,381 --> 01:18:36,580
you,
you were honest about yourself.

1848
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:39,190
You're like five or six years.
Your styles,

1849
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:41,200
so fucking aggressive and wild.
It's

1850
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:42,210
like,
well,

1851
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:45,390
I write,
I write letters to everyone that's close

1852
01:18:45,391 --> 01:18:47,070
to me before every fight.
Real.

1853
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:52,090
Yeah.
And every time I come back to life in 

1854
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:52,090
the fight,
I burned them all.

1855
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:56,900
Wow.
So literally I'm training the three 

1856
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,640
months that I'm training for a fight.
I'm literally training not to die.

1857
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:05,370
And if you knew there was a possibly 
you're going to die in this search area.

1858
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:08,460
Most people would avoid it,
but we have to do.

1859
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:12,720
I have to walk there on my own will and 
the stress level for me.

1860
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:17,780
I mean,
I wish I could just take it later and 

1861
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:18,360
say it's a sport.
I mean I have to like play it,

1862
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:23,480
you know,
like I had you ever heard the tenacious 

1863
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:23,480
d song?
Fuck me gently.

1864
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:25,590
The girl,
no girl fight.

1865
01:19:25,591 --> 01:19:27,930
If you look at the girl ring entrance 
after the ranch,

1866
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:28,860
I put on headphones.

1867
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:32,730
That's the song that was playing because
it's like a joke song.

1868
01:19:32,731 --> 01:19:34,360
It's so it makes it license my,
my,

1869
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,280
my,
like you,

1870
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:36,570
you're not going to die today.
You know,

1871
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:37,220
you,
you,

1872
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:42,260
there's going to be tomorrow.
I go into fights if it's the fights on 

1873
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,500
the 19th and someone asked me on the 
21st I got a party,

1874
01:19:43,501 --> 01:19:44,180
can you come?
I'm,

1875
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:48,900
I'm literally feeling inside men.
If I am at that party,

1876
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,680
I'm super happy because that means I'm 
still.

1877
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:53,140
I know I'm really,
really preparing for,

1878
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:54,840
for death that day.
You know?

1879
01:19:55,410 --> 01:20:00,410
And for me it's so stressful man.
I mean I actually didn't feel I could do

1880
01:20:01,141 --> 01:20:06,141
it anymore.
I mean every time I fought after I 

1881
01:20:06,141 --> 01:20:06,141
fought win or lose,
I always felt like shit nice to over.

1882
01:20:06,141 --> 01:20:08,610
I'm alive because I was willing to die 
in the fight,

1883
01:20:08,611 --> 01:20:13,560
you know?
So it's a little bit too intense for me,

1884
01:20:13,561 --> 01:20:13,770
you know?

1885
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:18,770
I mean,
what was the closest you think you came 

1886
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:18,770
to New York?
Probably eager.

1887
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:20,010
That was a crazy.
And that's actually the fight where I,

1888
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:22,320
I,
I thought that I should retire because,

1889
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:27,350
not because of the beating,
but because I didn't think there was 

1890
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:27,930
anything else in mma that would ever 
teach me to be a stronger man.

1891
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:32,390
I am.
I didn't once feel that I wanted to quit

1892
01:20:32,391 --> 01:20:34,410
or give up.
I never contemplated giving up at all.

1893
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:37,320
Not once.
And I mean I got,

1894
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,390
I had a broken finger out,
a broken jaw.

1895
01:20:39,391 --> 01:20:42,580
I had um,
a swollen brain prefer to your drum.

1896
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:48,000
And apparently my liver count was like 
2000 times to normal person.

1897
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,860
You had a swollen,
swollen brain.

1898
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:54,861
Yeah.
So they hospitalized me for the first 

1899
01:20:54,861 --> 01:20:58,670
four days because they want it to cat 
scan my brain every day because when 

1900
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:00,810
the,
when the swelling's impacting the veins,

1901
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:02,460
if tears bleeding,
you can't tell.

1902
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:07,020
And when the brain goes back to its size
and its not compacted anymore,

1903
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,210
if there's bleeding,
that's when you can tell the bleeding.

1904
01:21:09,211 --> 01:21:11,340
So they were worried that my brain might
be bleeding.

1905
01:21:11,341 --> 01:21:14,220
There might be bleeding in the brain.
Yeah.

1906
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:15,990
Well,
so what,

1907
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:18,780
while this is all going on,
how are you feeling?

1908
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:21,360
I feel fine really well.
Well,

1909
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:23,110
I kid.
The thing is is that when,

1910
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:25,560
if you watch the video of the fight,
when it was done,

1911
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:27,940
I remember laying down thinking,
holy shit,

1912
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:34,040
got over it.
Got To the first unit of the big 10 

1913
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:34,040
minute Raul,
you know,

1914
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:34,040
say,
look,

1915
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,280
you got best wrong second line.
I know I cut him something.

1916
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:38,620
We're going to stand good.
Start standing again almost on total toy

1917
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:43,640
and I'm going to open that cut up.
And I remember Egan leaning over to me 

1918
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,010
and looking at me and say,
I'm going to stop the fight.

1919
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,300
And I was like,
Whoa,

1920
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:47,170
no,
no,

1921
01:21:47,171 --> 01:21:48,870
no,
you're not sending the fight and we have

1922
01:21:48,871 --> 01:21:53,871
a rule that you don't throw a towel,
you know the tower that we have in the 

1923
01:21:53,871 --> 01:21:55,590
ring.
And she's always throw it there into the

1924
01:21:55,591 --> 01:22:00,591
fancy.
I think it was that bow quite throw it 

1925
01:22:00,591 --> 01:22:01,220
off.
And when Egan told me that,

1926
01:22:01,221 --> 01:22:01,890
I said,
shit,

1927
01:22:01,891 --> 01:22:03,770
I wanted to lay down at least seven,
another,

1928
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:06,220
maybe 10 seconds to kind of recollect 
and everything.

1929
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:07,920
And he said that.
I said,

1930
01:22:07,921 --> 01:22:12,921
Oh shit,
I got to get up because Egan's going to 

1931
01:22:12,921 --> 01:22:12,921
stop the fight.
So I got.

1932
01:22:12,921 --> 01:22:15,510
I started getting up and I remember 
getting up and walking to the corner,

1933
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:21,710
but my legs were under me and I was,
it was the weirdest feeling because I 

1934
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:23,640
felt like my below my waist was a whole 
different machine.

1935
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,920
I mean,
I was dragging on me.

1936
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:30,030
I was seeing shit my legs.
And then when I sat down in a corner,

1937
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,400
when you see the video,
I mean everyone says,

1938
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:33,660
you know that I'm screaming.
No,

1939
01:22:33,661 --> 01:22:34,200
no,
no,

1940
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:36,000
because this guy's trying to stop the 
fight.

1941
01:22:36,001 --> 01:22:41,001
But we got two minutes between rounds 
and that he comes in 10 seconds after I 

1942
01:22:41,001 --> 01:22:41,820
sit down and sing,
looking at me.

1943
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,210
Sagamore stopped the fight and I didn't 
realize how bad I looked,

1944
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,560
you know,
so I was saying,

1945
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:45,990
no,
no.

1946
01:22:45,991 --> 01:22:46,620
I'm thinking,
no,

1947
01:22:46,621 --> 01:22:48,390
no,
meaning that there's two more minutes,

1948
01:22:48,391 --> 01:22:53,391
give me two more minutes.
Checked me after the two minutes and 

1949
01:22:53,391 --> 01:22:53,391
then we give your assessment of them.
And I'm screaming.

1950
01:22:53,391 --> 01:22:53,460
No,
no,

1951
01:22:53,461 --> 01:22:54,090
no,
no.

1952
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:55,680
And the decor,
the fight,

1953
01:22:55,681 --> 01:22:59,030
you know,
and it happened to happen was I,

1954
01:22:59,031 --> 01:23:04,031
you know,
I had a preferred your gentleman a lost 

1955
01:23:04,031 --> 01:23:05,410
my balance.
So basically I couldn't if,

1956
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:08,540
unless I had like two days or three days
between their own,

1957
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:10,720
I probably couldn't have done the secure
on anyway.

1958
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:15,720
So I didn't know that.
But the thing that made me really happy 

1959
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:15,790
about that is when I saw the video on 
the fight,

1960
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:17,380
I,
I,

1961
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,870
my,
my heart and my spirit didn't die,

1962
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,090
you know,
as much as punishments I was taking.

1963
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,740
It was never an issue,
which,

1964
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:28,360
which really made me realize that if I 
take any more than a beating down,

1965
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:30,640
I'll probably die everything to myself 
that,

1966
01:23:30,641 --> 01:23:31,370
you know,
in mma,

1967
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:36,400
that as far as the test in my heart and 
tests as strong as a man is probably not

1968
01:23:36,431 --> 01:23:37,510
going to go any further than that.

1969
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:42,810
So you were thinking that you should 
retire because you proved to yourself 

1970
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:43,030
that you are willing to die literally.

1971
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:43,670
Yeah.
And I,

1972
01:23:43,671 --> 01:23:48,671
you know,
I already knew that wasn't going to be 

1973
01:23:48,671 --> 01:23:50,171
the best in the world.
I wasn't interested in grabbing a pride 

1974
01:23:50,171 --> 01:23:51,200
belt.
And I basically was fighting,

1975
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,020
if you look at all my fights when I took
fights,

1976
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,740
it was always when they were at the top 
of their game,

1977
01:23:54,741 --> 01:23:57,020
I took a heath hearing when he just beat
Erickson,

1978
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:59,510
took no girl when he was a top of the 
world.

1979
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:04,400
I took a marker when he was still 
considered a specimen,

1980
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:09,690
you know.
So all of these fights that I took was 

1981
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:09,690
when people are at the top of your game.
And I took those fights,

1982
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:13,040
not because I thought I could win.
I thought that there was the fights that

1983
01:24:13,041 --> 01:24:14,090
I.
There's no way I could win.

1984
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:19,430
That's the reason why I took those sites
because I thought I was going to put 

1985
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:19,430
myself in somewhere.

1986
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:23,270
That was gonna test my heart.
You went to sleep when the Nogueira 

1987
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:23,270
fire?
Yes.

1988
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:24,920
You got caught in a triangle and you 
didn't tap.

1989
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:26,360
Yeah,
I do see,

1990
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:29,150
the thing is,
is a thing that people always ask me,

1991
01:24:29,151 --> 01:24:34,151
you know,
they think that not tapping is about 

1992
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:36,770
being tough and being like macho and 
being someone who kind of feel pain,

1993
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:38,780
you know,
but the,

1994
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,250
the,
the truth of the matter is I have,

1995
01:24:40,251 --> 01:24:42,860
I have this saying that always referred 
to as a strong man,

1996
01:24:42,861 --> 01:24:45,710
feels no pain,
but a man with the summer spirit,

1997
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:49,280
Yamamotoyama she feels pain but can 
continue through the pain,

1998
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:50,790
you know.
So it's uh,

1999
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:53,730
when you fish for the recent were first 
part of the strong and Field Olympian.

2000
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:54,350
Oh,
that's cool.

2001
01:24:54,351 --> 01:24:56,060
That's what I want to be.
Anyway,

2002
01:24:56,061 --> 01:24:57,280
read.
The second part is like,

2003
01:24:58,230 --> 01:24:59,900
I started really,
really real.

2004
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:05,260
I mean,
but the real man is the one who feels 

2005
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:05,260
that pinball works truly pain,
you know,

2006
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:05,260
the,
the,

2007
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:10,340
the strong men fierce,
no opponent but the man of Yonathan and 

2008
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:12,170
she fears opponent and sees a challenge 
and takes it on head on,

2009
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,750
you know.
So that's my belief in the fighting,

2010
01:25:14,751 --> 01:25:16,220
you know.
So when I fought,

2011
01:25:16,221 --> 01:25:17,340
that's what it was all about,
you know,

2012
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,770
facing those fears.
You

2013
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:21,470
fought after the ego fight though.
You fought,

2014
01:25:21,471 --> 01:25:23,570
you fought heath herring,
then you fought Nogueira,

2015
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,970
then you fought and Ashita and then he 
fought Tommy.

2016
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:27,250
Yeah.
It was all,

2017
01:25:27,251 --> 01:25:29,080
you know,
it's so funny because it was all a thing

2018
01:25:29,081 --> 01:25:31,750
of my way of saying goodbye to fighting,
you know,

2019
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,760
because when I fought the Igor I 
thought,

2020
01:25:37,361 --> 01:25:39,100
okay,
I could retire today,

2021
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:39,890
but I thought,
you know,

2022
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:43,720
after all mma has done for me,
I want to give her fight.

2023
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:45,400
And I saw,
I said the hearing and pride,

2024
01:25:45,401 --> 01:25:50,401
Neil is going to retire to a fight,
but they didn't want to give me the mic 

2025
01:25:50,401 --> 01:25:51,370
and no one knew.
No one knew that I was retiring.

2026
01:25:51,371 --> 01:25:54,430
I just grabbed the mic and I said,
this is this,

2027
01:25:54,431 --> 01:25:57,600
the last of Yamaha mushy.
And everyone freaked out and that,

2028
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,550
and the reason why I fucked a girl who 
is because um,

2029
01:26:00,551 --> 01:26:05,551
when nine slash 11 happened,
I had a friend die in the second tower 

2030
01:26:05,551 --> 01:26:09,730
and I felt,
I really felt that I was being 

2031
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:11,900
hypocritical because I would look into 
see the special stuff in tv of the,

2032
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:16,220
the building collapsing and really 
literally feeling like Shit,

2033
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:21,460
you know,
I'm pretty much really dawning my day 

2034
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:24,160
and I can actually switch off the TV and
walk to the game center and laugh 

2035
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:24,770
without a problem with my friends.

2036
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:26,530
And I felt like a real prick and 
illegal.

2037
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:28,010
There's no honor.
I mean,

2038
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:29,570
if you really feel shitty about what 
something,

2039
01:26:29,571 --> 01:26:30,740
do something about it,
you know.

2040
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:36,310
So I talked to him,
I said what I want to do and I felt 

2041
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:36,310
really shitty retire.
I had that wave of change and now seeing

2042
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:38,120
I got to be fricking real to myself,
man,

2043
01:26:38,121 --> 01:26:40,010
I'm going to lose my honor funnel,
take care of this shit.

2044
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:41,990
So I thought I'm wanting to listen to 
army.

2045
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:44,740
So he started running list and I tried 
to enlist.

2046
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:46,700
I was 34,
I was 36 account,

2047
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:51,701
the cutoff age is 34 and the biggest 
thing I couldn't get her own as a 

2048
01:26:51,701 --> 01:26:55,181
tattoos are the uniform,
the head and the palm tattoos so I 

2049
01:26:55,181 --> 01:26:59,510
couldn't enlist and my thing was okay,
if I'm going to list,

2050
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:04,511
I didn't know I couldn't list or I 
thought one of the US I want to fight 

2051
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:05,720
one more fight because I don't know if 
I'm going to die there.

2052
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:10,960
I don't know if I'm going to come back 
mentally deranged or I'll never be able 

2053
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:10,960
to fight again.
And I figured I wanted to say a farewell

2054
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,390
fight and I asked for Vanderbilt and 
they gave me vendor.

2055
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:18,470
It was $200,000
to fight vendor and I was like,

2056
01:27:18,471 --> 01:27:23,471
are you guys just fucked up?
I would've fought valiantly for free 

2057
01:27:23,471 --> 01:27:23,990
because that's one guy.
I figured at the end,

2058
01:27:23,991 --> 01:27:27,110
my career with a bank,
we'd stand toe to toe dust clear.

2059
01:27:27,111 --> 01:27:28,910
Someone's going to be standing with me,
fine.

2060
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:30,740
If it's vandelay fine,
I'm good with it.

2061
01:27:30,741 --> 01:27:33,320
As long as it's true.
Total talk to the very end,

2062
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,850
you know?
So it was cool because I was seeing,

2063
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:37,610
this is awesome,
this is like picture perfect.

2064
01:27:37,611 --> 01:27:38,780
I'm going to fight violent,
going to war,

2065
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:40,220
I dyed hair,
I'm fine,

2066
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:41,990
you know,
and all of a sudden,

2067
01:27:41,991 --> 01:27:46,991
two weeks into the fight,
they called me and told me that they 

2068
01:27:46,991 --> 01:27:46,991
wanted me to fight.

2069
01:27:46,991 --> 01:27:46,991
No Garrett.
And I'm like,

2070
01:27:46,991 --> 01:27:50,440
you know,
I got my ass kicked by a lot of 

2071
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:50,440
heavyweights.
You know,

2072
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:50,440
I,
I,

2073
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,010
I kind of want to fight at my weight now
and I'm not interested in.

2074
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:54,350
Or Gary who was pride champion at the 
time,

2075
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:57,020
I thought it was more real for me to see
fight Vander Lee.

2076
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:58,470
I mean,
by the way,

2077
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:03,490
why did they change that?
Apparently what I finally did was they 

2078
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:06,311
got tomorrow so they tomorrow wouldn't 
be able to fight Nogueira with the size 

2079
01:28:06,311 --> 01:28:07,670
difference.
And also tomorrow,

2080
01:28:07,671 --> 01:28:12,671
fod vandalism.
They figured it was a big draw for 

2081
01:28:12,671 --> 01:28:12,671
tomorrow.
Tomorrow is a huge name in Japan.

2082
01:28:12,671 --> 01:28:14,930
So pro wrestling from,
from some of the you,

2083
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:17,250
Uwf,
Uwf the progressing.

2084
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:22,260
So you know,
as much as a fireworks as a world will 

2085
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:22,260
love the incident.
Vandelay,

2086
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,620
the Japanese crowd would love probably 
tomorrow.

2087
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:26,780
Vandelay bigger.
God Damn.

2088
01:28:26,781 --> 01:28:27,890
That would have been a crazy fight.

2089
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,450
You and vandelay would've been in 
Supernova.

2090
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:37,480
I would have my.
My whole thing about fighting van Lewis 

2091
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:40,000
to push them backwards because every 
time he gets he gets caught and every 

2092
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,991
one of his fights and I always notice 
that he says such fast recovery that as 

2093
01:28:43,991 --> 01:28:46,460
he's going down to recover since shoots 
for a single or double and he'll recover

2094
01:28:46,461 --> 01:28:51,461
them,
but I figured if I use me like toward 

2095
01:28:51,461 --> 01:28:51,740
did,
if you move federally backwards,

2096
01:28:51,741 --> 01:28:54,470
he hit them going backwards and he falls
backwards and you can end the fight.

2097
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:58,310
Now knowing your,
your,

2098
01:28:58,311 --> 01:29:02,300
your beliefs in this,
your philosophy of Yamato,

2099
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:07,380
the marshy,
how did you feel about the fights that 

2100
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:10,680
were.
There was some obvious works over there.

2101
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:15,770
There was,
there was some definite fights where 

2102
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:17,670
people were paid to lose and paid to win
and there was a lot of fuckery going on.

2103
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,080
Did that drive you crazy?

2104
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,680
It pisses me off to our went public on 
it.

2105
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:24,920
Did you mean public or autocard occur?
I'm couple.

2106
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:27,360
It's kind of coma was one of the most 
obvious.

2107
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,080
Yeah.
And you know,

2108
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:30,950
I went public on that and I didn't.
I tried to be nice about it.

2109
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:36,230
I,
I mean for a fighter who's willing to 

2110
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:39,161
die in the ring,
that's total disrespect to go into our 

2111
01:29:39,161 --> 01:29:42,851
ring,
that we're tripping our real blood and 

2112
01:29:42,851 --> 01:29:43,640
sweat in and willing to die in and these
guys are pulling works in there.

2113
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:47,450
It's just totally disrespect.
And when he,

2114
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:50,200
when he did that day that it was such a 
big thing that the,

2115
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:52,820
the MMA magazines,
Japan actually interviewed me about that

2116
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:54,110
really.
And I didn't,

2117
01:29:54,111 --> 01:29:59,111
I didn't,
I didn't be blatant and be a dick about 

2118
01:29:59,111 --> 01:29:59,111
it and say,
you know,

2119
01:29:59,111 --> 01:29:59,111
he fought a fake fight.
He's a human.

2120
01:29:59,111 --> 01:30:03,731
He's a faggot.
Know I just said that the rules that 

2121
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:05,540
Takata fought and the rule set I flight 
or two different rules and I believe the

2122
01:30:05,541 --> 01:30:07,220
rules that he fought,
she'd be in a different ring.

2123
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:10,130
So pretty much painting it out that it 
was bullshit fight,

2124
01:30:10,131 --> 01:30:11,560
you know.
So I,

2125
01:30:11,561 --> 01:30:16,561
I just stated that way and Tacada got 
pissed off at it and he banned all 

2126
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:21,940
interviews with me and stuck with Albert
together because Santa Clara was 

2127
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:22,460
fighting under Carter and yeah,
he was kind of pissed off,

2128
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,770
but you know,
he can go suck my eggs because,

2129
01:30:24,771 --> 01:30:26,210
you know what I'm telling the truth.

2130
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,130
That's all.
It was pretty obvious.

2131
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:33,131
The Coleman fight was like,
it was like pro wrestling and was so 

2132
01:30:33,131 --> 01:30:34,060
obvious.
He was like almost going to tap and uh,

2133
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:37,910
like adding drama to it.
It was so silly.

2134
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:40,700
But he had a few real fights.
You know,

2135
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:43,250
Takata had a real fight against Hixon.
That was a real fight.

2136
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:48,300
You could tell Hickson was.
And plus there was no way Hickson was 

2137
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,100
going to throw a five.
No Way.

2138
01:30:49,101 --> 01:30:49,990
No Way.
Yeah.

2139
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:51,230
Did you ever get to roll with Erickson?

2140
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:54,390
Yeah,
but that was when I was a white belt and

2141
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:56,880
of course he probably would've told me 
when I was a black belt,

2142
01:30:56,881 --> 01:31:01,881
but he told me he was a white belt and 
just kind of went through the whole 

2143
01:31:01,881 --> 01:31:01,881
school,
you know,

2144
01:31:01,881 --> 01:31:01,910
he lines over and squash it.
Everybody.

2145
01:31:01,911 --> 01:31:02,830
Yeah,
he did that so,

2146
01:31:02,831 --> 01:31:02,930
so

2147
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:07,970
yeah,
I've got a video that of one of his 

2148
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:10,241
seminars back when he ended up the 
Samurai ponytail and he just lines 

2149
01:31:10,851 --> 01:31:15,851
everybody up and just taps some over and
over and nobody knew what the fuck they 

2150
01:31:15,851 --> 01:31:16,310
were doing.
Everybody was essentially a white belt.

2151
01:31:16,311 --> 01:31:17,810
Maybe there was like a blue belt in the 
mix,

2152
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:23,170
but still it's so fascinating watching 
him just gently toy with everybody know,

2153
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:27,560
just choosing how it was worded.
The only,

2154
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:30,470
he's the one that for me,
I go,

2155
01:31:30,471 --> 01:31:32,450
God damn,
I wish he had more fights.

2156
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,960
He's one of the ones where I would have 
loved to see him fight.

2157
01:31:35,961 --> 01:31:40,961
I mean,
I had dinner with him many years back 

2158
01:31:40,961 --> 01:31:41,550
when fader was on top and he wanted to 
fight fader.

2159
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:43,670
Oh,
interesting.

2160
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:45,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

2161
01:31:45,081 --> 01:31:46,430
Very,
very.

2162
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,730
You know,
the real question was could he fade that

2163
01:31:49,731 --> 01:31:52,890
ground and pound fate or his ground and 
pound the wake.

2164
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:57,950
There was no fight.
Fucking incredible man that especially 

2165
01:31:58,581 --> 01:32:02,950
that first fight where he got them 
stuffed in the corner by the term bokken

2166
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:07,990
was just blast shots and that was when 
no Nogueira was at his most durable,

2167
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:11,470
very few other human beings would have 
be able to take those shots.

2168
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:16,650
The Window Garrett was taking them,
but I would have really loved to see 

2169
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:18,310
Hicks at against top level guys just to 
see if.

2170
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:23,580
Because he had this effect on people 
when he got ahold of them on the ground 

2171
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:24,310
like,
you're fucking done.

2172
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:28,250
Like no one was getting up.
No one was getting out of mount.

2173
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:31,000
Nolan was hip escaping and you know,
getting back to their feet.

2174
01:32:31,001 --> 01:32:33,700
There was none of that in his fights.
It was kicks in,

2175
01:32:33,701 --> 01:32:38,701
Mtsu you and then he punches you until 
you give up your back and they choked 

2176
01:32:38,701 --> 01:32:38,701
the shit out of you.

2177
01:32:38,701 --> 01:32:39,940
That was every fight becomes textbook.
Yeah.

2178
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:43,060
I wanted to see him against hire guys.
To this day,

2179
01:32:43,061 --> 01:32:44,680
he's the one guy that,
man,

2180
01:32:44,681 --> 01:32:48,610
it just really drives me nuts that he's 
in his fifties now and we missed it.

2181
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,070
We,
we,

2182
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,480
we really missed his opportunity.
Yeah.

2183
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:56,020
That's a great son real what everybody 
does in Jujitsu,

2184
01:32:56,021 --> 01:32:58,210
the Japan Valley Tudo days,
you know,

2185
01:32:58,211 --> 01:32:59,560
when you saw him,
you know,

2186
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:04,561
like right after hoists had made his 
mark in America Hickson and made his 

2187
01:33:04,561 --> 01:33:08,911
mark in Japan.
Really amazing documentary choke if you 

2188
01:33:08,911 --> 01:33:09,640
never seen it.
Folks,

2189
01:33:09,641 --> 01:33:11,410
if you're an MMA fan.
Ah,

2190
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:16,470
it's a classic,
really shows you what would Hickson's 

2191
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:19,300
all about in a very similar philosophy 
to you was where,

2192
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,110
you know,
he was,

2193
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:22,280
he was willing to die in there as well.
And you know,

2194
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:26,260
he was fighting with honor.
He would have never thrown a fight.

2195
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:30,570
So what you saw at the Catia setting up 
a fight with Hickson and you're like,

2196
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:32,380
well,
he's going to have to fight for real.

2197
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:33,880
Yeah.
That's gotta be weird.

2198
01:33:33,881 --> 01:33:36,790
Where some of his fights were fake and 
some of his fights were real.

2199
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:43,080
It's disrespectful.
That guy has no business being in their 

2200
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,320
memory and he won by one body kick.
Who the fuck did he fight?

2201
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:49,930
You kick somebody and it was like you 
were watching going like just didn't 

2202
01:33:50,651 --> 01:33:52,690
look legit at all.
Yeah,

2203
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:53,980
that guy.
Yeah.

2204
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,970
That guy got no good works for Carter,
but he was a big time pro wrestler.

2205
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:00,370
Right?
Is that he liked the rock,

2206
01:34:00,371 --> 01:34:02,710
like the Japanese were sort of like a.
yeah,

2207
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:06,340
but person is progressing,
but it's big over there.

2208
01:34:06,341 --> 01:34:06,970
Right?
Yeah.

2209
01:34:06,971 --> 01:34:09,070
It's still going on bigger.
Big here in Japan.

2210
01:34:09,071 --> 01:34:14,071
Yeah.
A lot of people don't realize like 

2211
01:34:14,071 --> 01:34:14,071
American MMA fighter sometimes they go 
over there and take fights too.

2212
01:34:14,071 --> 01:34:16,840
Like I know Tim Silvia's had mma,
but he said,

2213
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:17,830
you know,
progressing.

2214
01:34:17,831 --> 01:34:20,440
Josh Barnett's huge over there.
He does a lot of that shit.

2215
01:34:20,441 --> 01:34:25,441
Right.
Josh is one of those few guys that can 

2216
01:34:25,441 --> 01:34:25,441
do both and do it.
Does.

2217
01:34:25,441 --> 01:34:25,840
It will also clear.
I've also.

2218
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:27,500
Oh,
Bob Sapp is pretty good too.

2219
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:28,290
Attitude.
Well,

2220
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:31,910
he doesn't do fighting,
but not anymore as far as,

2221
01:34:31,911 --> 01:34:32,400
uh,
yeah.

2222
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:35,220
Josh is unreal.
It's so fun.

2223
01:34:35,221 --> 01:34:37,440
He enjoys it.
Josh really likes the program.

2224
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,440
He's more of a person.
The MMA fighter,

2225
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:42,240
you think so?
He's an MMA fighter and he's a professor

2226
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:42,480
that,

2227
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,680
that just is really good at everything.
Yeah.

2228
01:34:45,681 --> 01:34:48,440
I'm,
I'm fascinated by josh has longevity.

2229
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:49,610
I mean,
you look at him,

2230
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:54,700
he's a God that was ufc heavyweight 
champion in 2001,

2231
01:34:55,161 --> 01:34:58,610
I think it was.
And he still in the mix,

2232
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:02,390
2013,
still top five heavyweight in the world.

2233
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:04,430
Amazing.
Hasn't lost a step.

2234
01:35:04,431 --> 01:35:06,440
Said I believe that guy can be the best 
in the world.

2235
01:35:06,690 --> 01:35:09,440
I just still,
even even at the strikeforce tournament,

2236
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:11,630
was it a strikeforce?
He lost a May,

2237
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,490
but he,
he broke his hand in the first round.

2238
01:35:13,491 --> 01:35:17,240
I thought I thought Josh hands down even
with further in it.

2239
01:35:17,241 --> 01:35:18,770
I thought jostens though.
Really?

2240
01:35:18,990 --> 01:35:23,300
I picked justin reading.
That was another fucking lost in the MMA

2241
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:25,550
world when,
when he pissed hot and he couldn't fight

2242
01:35:25,551 --> 01:35:28,240
fader and they closed the flushing.
Yeah,

2243
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,540
that was huge.
I was a,

2244
01:35:29,610 --> 01:35:31,460
that was a big.
That would have been a crazy fight,

2245
01:35:31,461 --> 01:35:31,880
man.

2246
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,970
Josh Higgins feto would have been very,
very interesting.

2247
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:40,060
And that was,
that was fate or in its prime to after 

2248
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:42,791
the Tim Silvia knockout was like,
everybody was terrified of fate or he 

2249
01:35:42,791 --> 01:35:43,030
just looked like a fucking issue.
He,

2250
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:45,770
it was a destroyer,
but again,

2251
01:35:45,771 --> 01:35:47,480
like somebody did a,
um,

2252
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:48,050
uh,
they,

2253
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:53,060
they wrote this thing about fighters.
Will you look at fighters from the time 

2254
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:57,581
they entered into high level MMA 
competition to the time they started to 

2255
01:35:57,581 --> 01:36:00,941
fade and with almost all of them,
it's like seven and nine years,

2256
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:06,250
like between seven and nine years.
You see the transition where it drops 

2257
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:07,580
off.
Not Josh Barnett,

2258
01:36:07,581 --> 01:36:10,050
man.
They're just living every day.

2259
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:13,340
Fifteen plus years still at the top of 
his game.

2260
01:36:13,370 --> 01:36:15,200
I met that Guy [inaudible] 97 when he 
was with.

2261
01:36:15,201 --> 01:36:18,770
I was training for work.
She's 90 don't work.

2262
01:36:18,771 --> 01:36:23,771
She'd leave.
It was 2000 something when I went to a 

2263
01:36:23,771 --> 01:36:24,780
gym to train when he was fighting in 
Japan,

2264
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,800
in Hawaii when you were living there 
when super broad,

2265
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:29,110
just like a little fat kid though.

2266
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:33,300
It was bad as big crazy belly buddy.
He was gangster man.

2267
01:36:33,301 --> 01:36:33,860
Yeah,
he was.

2268
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:37,310
He was a fucking wild.
That is wild.

2269
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:42,380
You know his trainer.
That's another interesting story of Matt

2270
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:42,860
Hume.
You know,

2271
01:36:42,861 --> 01:36:45,860
Matt Hume is one of those guys that was 
a pioneer,

2272
01:36:45,861 --> 01:36:50,861
was there in the early days and it's 
still viable and on top of the game 

2273
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:54,080
today,
still on top of the curve trains,

2274
01:36:54,081 --> 01:36:56,720
you know Demetrius Johnson,
flyweight fighter,

2275
01:36:56,721 --> 01:36:59,750
a world champion.
It was training Matt Brown a lot,

2276
01:36:59,751 --> 01:37:04,751
a lot of like top level guys like rich 
Franklin spent a lot of time down there 

2277
01:37:04,751 --> 01:37:07,840
training and everybody respects him 
being very well rounded and,

2278
01:37:07,841 --> 01:37:09,490
and,
and a great thing.

2279
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:15,430
He's one of the few guys that made it 
all the way through and it was in the 

2280
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:18,320
early days he fought in shooto.
He fought in that contenders thing.

2281
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:23,060
Yeah,
still still on top of it.

2282
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:26,120
He's still training guys at the highest 
level today.

2283
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:31,450
I think that's fascinating that some 
guys like figure it all out along the 

2284
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:33,650
line and some guys like whether it's the
lion's Dan or whether it's,

2285
01:37:33,651 --> 01:37:36,260
you know,
the military fighting systems,

2286
01:37:36,261 --> 01:37:41,080
I sorta like disband and you give away 
and step away from the fence.

2287
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:45,740
Was AMC pankration still on top of Shit?
He's still like,

2288
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:46,570
right.
Smart Guy,

2289
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:47,570
man.
Very smart,

2290
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:52,571
very smart.
I love listening to him give advice in 

2291
01:37:52,571 --> 01:37:55,160
the corner because you'll hear like 
sometimes in the corner,

2292
01:37:55,170 --> 01:38:00,170
like the Qa,
like a fighter will have his friends in 

2293
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:00,570
the corner.
It's like you'll hear stupid advice like

2294
01:38:00,571 --> 01:38:01,770
go kick his ass,
come on kick.

2295
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:07,400
But you know,
you'll hear Matt Hume like you got to 

2296
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:07,400
check that leg kick,
moved to the left.

2297
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:08,220
You got to do this.
When he shooting,

2298
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,410
when he shooting,
that's when you're punching.

2299
01:38:10,411 --> 01:38:13,740
When he gives you like a real technical 
shit,

2300
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:14,910
you know,
you'll see what,

2301
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:18,990
what the guy did that are applicable to 
what's going on inside the cage.

2302
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:23,990
Like real point for point instruction to
deal with his very specific situation 

2303
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:25,920
that he's facing it.
That's so rare.

2304
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:28,710
When I fought joe is in Japan and that 
was in this corner.

2305
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:31,470
Oh,
every time I was trying to set something

2306
01:38:31,471 --> 01:38:32,670
up,
tell him.

2307
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:37,950
It was the first time in my career that 
I ever felt like shit.

2308
01:38:37,951 --> 01:38:42,050
The corpsman really screwing up my game.
Every time I thought of something.

2309
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:44,810
Washer aren't mature and he'd suck.
You didn't really cause shit.

2310
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:50,170
Well,
I couldn't set anything up because Matt 

2311
01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:51,240
was seeing ahead and he knew when my hip
shifted was with farm.

2312
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:54,450
When they did this to Russia,
the turnover was so hip throw.

2313
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:59,810
He was giving them the heads up one step
ahead of time and so huge to have a guy 

2314
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:04,950
in this rare and so used to have a mini 
coordinate in Japan where you could 

2315
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:04,950
actually hear him.

2316
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:09,410
Yeah.
That's a lot of people don't realize 

2317
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:12,370
that.
It's a crazy quiet during these pride 

2318
01:39:12,370 --> 01:39:14,100
fights.
There would be 90,000

2319
01:39:14,101 --> 01:39:17,310
people in an arena and you could hear 
everyone's corner.

2320
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:22,830
It was crazy,
so strange and attentive to.

2321
01:39:23,011 --> 01:39:25,530
It's not like they're not paying 
attention and clapping.

2322
01:39:25,531 --> 01:39:27,860
When someone passed the guard,
he would hear like a,

2323
01:39:28,970 --> 01:39:33,970
like a group of people clapping and then
everyone's settled down and be quiet 

2324
01:39:33,970 --> 01:39:34,890
again.
Do you miss that,

2325
01:39:34,891 --> 01:39:39,891
that,
that respectful approach to to the 

2326
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:41,130
sport?
I think it's good in bed too.

2327
01:39:41,450 --> 01:39:44,250
I mean the American public where they're
screaming like idiots.

2328
01:39:44,251 --> 01:39:49,251
You know,
they're screaming at the every punch 

2329
01:39:49,251 --> 01:39:49,251
thrown when he stopped brawling start 
bullying.

2330
01:39:49,251 --> 01:39:49,251
You know what I mean?
It's,

2331
01:39:49,251 --> 01:39:51,720
it's an animal African.
There's also pretty good for the event,

2332
01:39:51,721 --> 01:39:53,490
you know,
I mean there's,

2333
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:56,460
there's a give and take to both.
The booing drives me nuts.

2334
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,580
Yeah.
I mean sometimes we just say you there,

2335
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:03,590
they're baking awesome.
Transition on the ground bullying and 

2336
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:03,590
say get a clue,
you know,

2337
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:08,271
but it's the real problem is people that
go there just to see blood or just to 

2338
01:40:08,401 --> 01:40:13,401
see an event and they don't know what 
they're saying and so everybody knows 

2339
01:40:13,401 --> 01:40:17,751
what's going on with two dudes or if you
and igor were thrown down in the middle 

2340
01:40:17,751 --> 01:40:18,340
of the cage,
everybody knows what's happened over the

2341
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:23,340
middle of the ring as it were.
Everybody knows you could see that you 

2342
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:26,061
go this crazy.
Someone's going to get knocked the fuck 

2343
01:40:26,061 --> 01:40:27,981
out,
but when you watching like some high 

2344
01:40:27,981 --> 01:40:28,500
level transitions in the ground,
if you don't know what they're doing,

2345
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:30,450
you're lost.
You're in.

2346
01:40:30,451 --> 01:40:34,830
So people would start booing.
That's so disheartening.

2347
01:40:34,831 --> 01:40:36,360
To me.
It just drives me nuts.

2348
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:41,361
It's like,
I love the fact that the UFC could fill 

2349
01:40:41,361 --> 01:40:41,830
up these big arenas,
but I,

2350
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:46,930
I hate the fact that filling them up 
with a certain percentage of Douche 

2351
01:40:46,930 --> 01:40:46,930
bags.

2352
01:40:46,930 --> 01:40:48,690
Yeah,
I guess the money's still green,

2353
01:40:50,090 --> 01:40:55,090
but it's like I wish that the martial 
arts aspect was respected and 

2354
01:40:56,471 --> 01:41:01,471
appreciated and I feel like the only way
that's ever going to really happen is 

2355
01:41:01,471 --> 01:41:05,431
for a much larger percent of the 
audience to be martial artists 

2356
01:41:05,431 --> 01:41:09,091
themselves to be training and not just 
to do it isn't a trend and actually see 

2357
01:41:09,091 --> 01:41:13,520
happening where it's think it's 
increasingly not much drunk idiots just 

2358
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:13,570
screening for blood.
No,

2359
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:16,540
there's definitely less and it depends 
on where you are.

2360
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:21,541
Like there's some places where they're,
they're super polite and some places 

2361
01:41:21,541 --> 01:41:23,740
where they're just go fucking crazy.
It would be the worst than Brazil is the

2362
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:26,840
most like vocal,
but,

2363
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:30,550
but they're getting a lot better to.
Whereas Brazil,

2364
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:33,850
it used to be that foreigners just got 
booed no matter what.

2365
01:41:33,851 --> 01:41:35,830
Like Mike Pyle,
for instance,

2366
01:41:35,831 --> 01:41:37,060
Mike Pyle,
um,

2367
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:40,570
he,
he won in Brazil and he knocked out.

2368
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:45,160
I forget who he fought.
He knocked a guy from Ludlow,

2369
01:41:45,161 --> 01:41:47,110
Massachusetts,
he trades out a team link.

2370
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:51,730
He trains with Gabriel Gonzaga,
but pile was super respectful,

2371
01:41:51,731 --> 01:41:53,590
didn't do anything wrong,
just one,

2372
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:54,850
you know.
And uh,

2373
01:41:54,910 --> 01:41:57,860
after he won,
he was in the ring in the cage,

2374
01:41:57,861 --> 01:42:02,861
it was just,
I was interviewing him and the whole 

2375
01:42:02,861 --> 01:42:04,650
crowd is chanting something.
So I asked the translator,

2376
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:05,770
I'm like,
what are they saying?

2377
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:08,350
And the saying,
he's a faggot.

2378
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:14,360
That's what they're chanting.
The whole crowd was calling him a 

2379
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:16,490
faggot.
Wow.

2380
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,530
That is crazy.
And he didn't do anything wrong.

2381
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:20,760
All he did,
Ricardo Punch,

2382
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:22,520
that's what we fought.
All he did was one,

2383
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:24,420
he stopped him and knocked him out.
All he did was,

2384
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:28,530
yeah.
And Mike put my bio but was super.

2385
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:29,910
It was.
Thank you very much.

2386
01:42:29,911 --> 01:42:33,480
It was bound to everybody waving and 
everybody's like,

2387
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:34,470
Hey,
fuck you.

2388
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:37,230
There was a 16 year old little kids 
like,

2389
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:42,320
fuck you,
like yell and scream and given him the 

2390
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:42,320
finger to the cage.
And he's like,

2391
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:46,251
Hey,
what can I do to get them to the back 

2392
01:42:46,251 --> 01:42:46,251
and into the back?

2393
01:42:46,251 --> 01:42:48,560
The whole place was chanting,
you're a faggot.

2394
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:53,240
Wow.
Brazil's the most vocal,

2395
01:42:53,330 --> 01:42:56,060
but they,
they lightened up about that,

2396
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:56,720
the,
the,

2397
01:42:56,730 --> 01:43:01,730
the,
the nationalism because I think the 

2398
01:43:01,730 --> 01:43:04,361
first time I was there was only the 
second event that the UFC had done in 

2399
01:43:04,361 --> 01:43:04,361
Rio and many,
many,

2400
01:43:04,361 --> 01:43:09,131
many years.
So it was a big thing to have the UFC 

2401
01:43:09,131 --> 01:43:10,700
there and they were like super,
super nationalistic and charged up.

2402
01:43:10,970 --> 01:43:15,710
But then after we did two more events in
Brazil that kind of relaxed a little bit

2403
01:43:15,711 --> 01:43:20,711
on that and would even applaud fighters 
that showed sportsmanship and one who 

2404
01:43:20,711 --> 01:43:21,380
were foreigners.
You know,

2405
01:43:21,381 --> 01:43:23,090
even if they beat a Brazilian,
you know,

2406
01:43:23,091 --> 01:43:23,950
they,
they,

2407
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:25,320
they showed they,
they,

2408
01:43:25,321 --> 01:43:28,160
they clap for people like rich Franklin.
Perfect example,

2409
01:43:28,161 --> 01:43:33,161
when he beat Vandelay,
they actually clapped for rich Franklin 

2410
01:43:33,161 --> 01:43:33,161
and he tried to address them in 
Portuguese.

2411
01:43:33,161 --> 01:43:35,210
He had something that he had prepared 
and learned.

2412
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:40,900
So it was Kinda cool.
It was cool to see that even though 

2413
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:40,900
Richard One and beaten vandelay

2414
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:43,970
they liked it.
They were happy,

2415
01:43:43,971 --> 01:43:44,370
happy.

2416
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:45,220
But I guess,
you know,

2417
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:50,270
he had also shown like a massive respect
of Anderson Anderson had beaten him and 

2418
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:55,930
you I think,
I think a lot of people had a lot of 

2419
01:43:55,930 --> 01:43:57,800
respect for rich there.
But as far as the sound they make though

2420
01:43:57,890 --> 01:44:02,890
no one's louder than Brazil.
Here I've been in fights where I had to 

2421
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:06,521
take my ears,
my ear pieces off and just like 

2422
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:11,540
turnaround listen,
because I couldn't believe how loud it 

2423
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:11,540
was.
Like this can't be real.

2424
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:14,570
So I took the headphones off because the
headphones mute most of the shit.

2425
01:44:14,571 --> 01:44:19,571
You hear what I'm hearing this crazy 
noise through the microphone and then I 

2426
01:44:19,571 --> 01:44:22,210
take these off and you hear the volume 
like Whoa.

2427
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:24,650
So I like tap Goldberg and like take 
your shit off,

2428
01:44:24,651 --> 01:44:29,651
take your shit up.
And like as they were introducing a 

2429
01:44:29,651 --> 01:44:29,651
Anderson,
you take your,

2430
01:44:29,651 --> 01:44:30,140
your,
your headphones off,

2431
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:33,470
you look around like the sound was a 
roar.

2432
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:36,890
It was just like a jet was going off 
behind your ears.

2433
01:44:38,670 --> 01:44:42,910
They're all pounding on the ground.
Anderson the spider,

2434
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:52,510
they weren't going fucking crazy.
I've never experienced that before.

2435
01:44:52,511 --> 01:44:54,790
This is,
Dana was saying it louder than anywhere.

2436
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:57,340
They're passionate motherfuckers in 
Brazil,

2437
01:44:57,341 --> 01:44:59,590
man,
that is a passionate country.

2438
01:45:00,370 --> 01:45:02,470
They get excited for their own,
but they,

2439
01:45:02,471 --> 01:45:05,670
they relaxed on the foreign hate,
you know,

2440
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,240
which was Kinda cool.
Yeah,

2441
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,250
this is,
they're the most loud,

2442
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:13,540
but as far as the most polite England's 
pretty fucking polite.

2443
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:15,550
They're,
they're pretty polite in England.

2444
01:45:15,610 --> 01:45:16,540
Yeah.
I thought,

2445
01:45:16,541 --> 01:45:17,360
you know,
they're,

2446
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:19,930
they're,
they're pretty nationalistic themselves,

2447
01:45:19,931 --> 01:45:20,330
you know,
they're,

2448
01:45:20,331 --> 01:45:21,170
they're like,
you know,

2449
01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:23,440
root for bisping and rooting for,
you know,

2450
01:45:23,441 --> 01:45:25,540
a Brad Pickett and anybody who's 
fighting.

2451
01:45:25,541 --> 01:45:27,490
It's an English guy,
but they're there.

2452
01:45:27,491 --> 01:45:28,720
They're pretty polite in England,

2453
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:29,860
you know?
Um,

2454
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:34,970
I just went to New Zealand last year,
the end of last year and it tripped me 

2455
01:45:35,461 --> 01:45:38,940
out because New Zealand is like 20 years
ago,

2456
01:45:38,941 --> 01:45:41,220
America really couldn't believe it.
Man.

2457
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:46,460
These guys will know what the MME is.
And when I finally explained to one of 

2458
01:45:46,831 --> 01:45:48,450
the immigration officers what it is,
he goes,

2459
01:45:48,451 --> 01:45:50,580
oh,
so you beat people for a living.

2460
01:45:51,630 --> 01:45:52,050
I'm like,
oh,

2461
01:45:52,051 --> 01:45:54,910
that's the animosity you had back in the
day when they were singing.

2462
01:45:54,911 --> 01:45:57,690
It was human dogfighting yeah.
And then you go to,

2463
01:45:57,691 --> 01:46:02,691
um,
and they were running into the same 

2464
01:46:02,691 --> 01:46:04,401
problems.
The boxing commission is the one that's 

2465
01:46:04,401 --> 01:46:04,650
interfering.
It has so much party stopping it because

2466
01:46:04,651 --> 01:46:06,690
they're afraid that MMA is going to take
over boxing.

2467
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:10,020
And it's like the whole same thing all 
over again.

2468
01:46:10,021 --> 01:46:15,021
And the craziest thing about New Zealand
is you got these crazy fighters there.

2469
01:46:15,031 --> 01:46:20,031
I mean guys,
it can go the jaws of stone and they 

2470
01:46:20,031 --> 01:46:20,460
got,
they can hit,

2471
01:46:20,461 --> 01:46:22,200
they can mean a lot of stuff.

2472
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:24,800
A country full of mark hunt's.
Oh my God,

2473
01:46:24,801 --> 01:46:25,730
there's a lot of them do

2474
01:46:25,770 --> 01:46:28,380
the big boys in there.
They're all to fight,

2475
01:46:28,381 --> 01:46:29,700
you know.
And I,

2476
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:34,140
I'm wondering how the Hell is this 
country 20 years behind?

2477
01:46:34,230 --> 01:46:35,780
I mean I couldn't

2478
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:37,390
corruption.
Is that what it is?

2479
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:38,030
I mean,
how is it?

2480
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:40,480
Is New York state's still illegal?
That drives me.

2481
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:42,940
That drives me nuts.
That drives me nuts.

2482
01:46:42,941 --> 01:46:45,010
And that's all corruption.
We know the root of that.

2483
01:46:45,130 --> 01:46:47,290
It's the culinary union,
the Coronary Union,

2484
01:46:47,490 --> 01:46:52,490
they want station casinos to go union.
So they're bing politicians and 

2485
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:53,880
politicians are trying their best

2486
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:57,380
New Zealand too because like I couldn't 
understand it.

2487
01:46:57,381 --> 01:46:59,810
I couldn't understand how this country 
would be

2488
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:05,180
behind.
It's stupid too because it's not going 

2489
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:05,180
to hurt boxing.
It's not going to hurt kickboxing,

2490
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:05,430
you know,
I,

2491
01:47:05,431 --> 01:47:08,460
I really feel like there's plenty of 
room for all the combat sports.

2492
01:47:08,461 --> 01:47:13,461
I think that there is something to 
watching like a floyd mayweather or 

2493
01:47:13,461 --> 01:47:17,130
watching a guy who's a fantastic boxer 
and it's always,

2494
01:47:17,190 --> 01:47:19,230
it's always going to be something that 
people want to watch.

2495
01:47:19,231 --> 01:47:22,350
And I'm a big fan of high level 
kickboxing too.

2496
01:47:22,351 --> 01:47:26,610
I Love K One and glory is doing a lot of
big shows now too.

2497
01:47:26,611 --> 01:47:29,850
I love watching that as well.
I think there's room for all that shit.

2498
01:47:29,851 --> 01:47:30,660
I really do.
Yeah.

2499
01:47:30,661 --> 01:47:31,530
Oh there is.
Yeah.

2500
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:35,520
And they can work together know and they
should promote an mma.

2501
01:47:35,521 --> 01:47:37,090
Don't be stupid.
Don't try to fight it.

2502
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:42,340
Fighting it mean you can go into New 
Zealand and half the people will hate 

2503
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:45,000
marsh sharks.
Can you believe that?

2504
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:45,890
I mean,
back in the day,

2505
01:47:45,891 --> 01:47:48,980
you remember back in the day when I'm 
UFC,

2506
01:47:49,580 --> 01:47:53,200
MMA was considered.
I mean like we,

2507
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:58,110
when I first started doing post fight 
interviews,

2508
01:47:58,410 --> 01:48:02,550
it was like 97 and I was on a TV show,
news radio and I would tell people I was

2509
01:48:02,551 --> 01:48:07,551
going to fly to Dothan Alabama to go 
work at an ultimate fighting 

2510
01:48:07,681 --> 01:48:08,610
championship event.
They're like,

2511
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:10,560
why are you doing this to yourself?
Like,

2512
01:48:10,561 --> 01:48:13,440
what are you doing to your career?
You wrote your reputation.

2513
01:48:13,441 --> 01:48:15,510
Like it was like I was going to go do 
some porn.

2514
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:21,490
I'm going to go,
I'm going to go and film some porno 

2515
01:48:21,490 --> 01:48:21,490
films.
They're like,

2516
01:48:21,490 --> 01:48:24,501
what the fuck are you doing?
Like why are you getting involved in 

2517
01:48:24,501 --> 01:48:24,501
cage fighting?
And I was like,

2518
01:48:24,501 --> 01:48:29,301
well,
I think some day is going to be bigger 

2519
01:48:29,301 --> 01:48:29,301
than football.
They're like,

2520
01:48:29,301 --> 01:48:29,301
you're out of your fucking mind.
I'm like,

2521
01:48:29,301 --> 01:48:30,850
all right,
these here,

2522
01:48:32,370 --> 01:48:35,400
nobody would ever thought that.
Nobody would have ever thought back then

2523
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:38,040
that,
that it would happen so fast.

2524
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:42,480
They know it's going to be a trip for 
you to have been there and the dawn

2525
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:44,230
and to see it now,
man,

2526
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:46,410
it makes me happy,
man,

2527
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:49,590
because that basically mixed martial art
has made me who I am today.

2528
01:48:49,591 --> 01:48:51,270
Everything that I have,
the reputation that I have,

2529
01:48:51,271 --> 01:48:56,271
the people that I know is all due to 
that and just to see how big it's 

2530
01:48:56,271 --> 01:49:01,160
become.
I mean I don't even have this mvs thing 

2531
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:01,160
where I wish I was fighting this time 
where there's more money.

2532
01:49:01,190 --> 01:49:06,190
I'm really happy to what I did and where
I was and the opportunities I had and I 

2533
01:49:06,190 --> 01:49:06,510
just,
you know,

2534
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:08,850
as much as some people like to rip on 
Dana,

2535
01:49:08,851 --> 01:49:13,851
man,
I got nothing but good words to say 

2536
01:49:13,851 --> 01:49:13,851
because it's what he's done for the 
sport.

2537
01:49:13,851 --> 01:49:13,851
You know what I mean?

2538
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:16,350
Yeah.
The people that rip on them either don't

2539
01:49:16,351 --> 01:49:18,990
know them or they've got some business 
issues with him.

2540
01:49:19,030 --> 01:49:21,210
Must Be A.
I love that dude.

2541
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:22,940
He's straight up too.
I liked the way you,

2542
01:49:22,941 --> 01:49:25,180
you and him are straight up and if you 
don't like the guy,

2543
01:49:25,181 --> 01:49:27,470
you don't let the bullshit and you know

2544
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:30,870
that's the only way to be.
Especially in this business.

2545
01:49:30,871 --> 01:49:35,871
This is the realest business ever.
This is the real estate sport of all 

2546
01:49:35,871 --> 01:49:39,561
time.
There's no sport broken down to me more 

2547
01:49:39,561 --> 01:49:43,161
so even than boxing,
broken down to its raw cost element 

2548
01:49:43,161 --> 01:49:44,190
acceptable by society.
What is,

2549
01:49:44,191 --> 01:49:45,240
what is it?
Real sport.

2550
01:49:45,241 --> 01:49:48,070
It's man dominating another man with 
discipline.

2551
01:49:48,071 --> 01:49:50,980
Focus,
technique will intelligence and heart,

2552
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:56,290
and that is all sports.
That's the route in what people admire 

2553
01:49:56,290 --> 01:49:59,941
in all sports,
but MMA and bodies that it's the purest 

2554
01:49:59,941 --> 01:50:01,600
form of sport.
You know if you say you love sports,

2555
01:50:01,601 --> 01:50:03,850
but you don't like mma,
you don't really love sports.

2556
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:09,400
You don't know what sports really are 
because every man in a fucking football 

2557
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,980
uniform running into other man wants to 
beat those guys asses.

2558
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:14,920
Every time a guy slam dunks a ball on a 
guy's face,

2559
01:50:15,070 --> 01:50:18,490
he really wants to beat that dude's ass.
Do you wanna you wanna win.

2560
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:20,950
You wanna win when it's most important?
Yeah,

2561
01:50:21,230 --> 01:50:22,210
that's the most important.

2562
01:50:22,230 --> 01:50:24,150
The incredible thing I like about it,
I mean is,

2563
01:50:24,151 --> 01:50:27,530
is that fighter has to do everything.
You know what I mean?

2564
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:28,770
You got,
you got a quarterback,

2565
01:50:28,771 --> 01:50:30,210
you got to center,
you've got linebackers,

2566
01:50:30,211 --> 01:50:35,211
you go wide receivers,
you got everyone that has a certain job 

2567
01:50:35,211 --> 01:50:35,960
in the whole sport,
but you,

2568
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:36,630
you,
I mean,

2569
01:50:36,631 --> 01:50:37,740
I don't have.
Okay,

2570
01:50:37,741 --> 01:50:38,660
I'll do the ground.
Yeah.

2571
01:50:38,770 --> 01:50:43,770
And I'll get a ram pieces than my 
standing and I'll get maybe chuck to do 

2572
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:43,870
my wrestling.

2573
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:45,590
You know what I mean?
To say you can't do that.

2574
01:50:45,591 --> 01:50:47,470
You can it off and say,
oh,

2575
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:48,590
okay,
offensive time.

2576
01:50:48,591 --> 01:50:51,670
Come in and get the strikers in.
I mean,

2577
01:50:51,710 --> 01:50:52,730
you're in there and you got to.

2578
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:55,150
You gotta learn how to do be the 
quarterback.

2579
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:57,670
You get to learn how to be the center.
You've got 100 make blocks.

2580
01:50:57,671 --> 01:50:59,260
You get to learn how to catch the ball.

2581
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:02,220
I always thought it was weird when you 
heard a trainer say,

2582
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:03,420
we,
you know,

2583
01:51:03,421 --> 01:51:08,421
we want to win this first round.
We want to go out there and do this and 

2584
01:51:08,421 --> 01:51:08,421
you know,
wow,

2585
01:51:08,421 --> 01:51:12,450
you know,
what we worked on in the gym is this 

2586
01:51:12,450 --> 01:51:12,450
what?
Like,

2587
01:51:12,450 --> 01:51:12,460
it's not really a lot of [inaudible] 
going on here.

2588
01:51:13,090 --> 01:51:16,210
Fucking that guides him.
You really shouldn't be saying we,

2589
01:51:16,540 --> 01:51:19,540
you know,
we trained him to do this.

2590
01:51:19,850 --> 01:51:24,850
You know,
we showed him that he's been working 

2591
01:51:24,850 --> 01:51:24,850
hard in the gym.
You know,

2592
01:51:24,850 --> 01:51:26,890
we've been pushing him know,
but when it's in the cage,

2593
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:28,300
we want to win this first round there.
No,

2594
01:51:28,420 --> 01:51:31,540
he's going to win that first round.
You really don't have any to do it.

2595
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:35,620
Nobody helps them prepare.
But he's going to fight the fight.

2596
01:51:35,621 --> 01:51:36,680
Yeah.
If you don't

2597
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:38,450
have the mind for it.
And that.

2598
01:51:38,810 --> 01:51:43,810
That is really where it all boils down.
The mindset and the ability to overcome 

2599
01:51:46,521 --> 01:51:49,100
obstacles.
So much of it is mental.

2600
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:53,090
So much of deciding the right things to 
do.

2601
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:58,360
And when you were talking about seeing 
guys break and knowing the guys are 

2602
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:02,561
breaking,
how many times you seen guys give up a 

2603
01:52:02,561 --> 01:52:02,660
choke when you know that they didn't,
they,

2604
01:52:02,661 --> 01:52:04,550
you know,
they know how to get out of that.

2605
01:52:04,570 --> 01:52:05,600
But they,
they tap,

2606
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:09,350
you know that they're just looking for a
way out of the pressure of the moment.

2607
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:10,120
Well,
you know,

2608
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:12,650
you know,
when you really think about it is you.

2609
01:52:12,651 --> 01:52:15,150
Have you ever questioned why people tan?
Yeah.

2610
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:20,280
It's not because of the pain is because 
of the anticipation of what they think 

2611
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,400
is going to happen to.
That's what it is.

2612
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:27,060
Rarely do you have a garlic Nogueira or 
Henzel and Misha tate who gets her arm 

2613
01:52:27,761 --> 01:52:29,350
broke and then taps,
you know,

2614
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:35,100
these people.
I see a lot of guys tapping out to 

2615
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:35,520
armbars and,
and waving to the French,

2616
01:52:35,521 --> 01:52:37,120
shaking their hands after with the same 
arm.

2617
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:40,300
I see people tap Baltic chokes and glow 
and drinking that night.

2618
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:41,800
You know?
I mean,

2619
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,990
it's anticipation is basically what it 
is.

2620
01:52:43,991 --> 01:52:47,060
And tapping all is basically a mind 
focus.

2621
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:52,120
If you're focusing on getting up,
you focusing on hurting the guy before 

2622
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:53,330
he hurts you and you're not focusing on,
oh shit,

2623
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:56,810
my arm's gonna get broken.
It's going to be all fucked up tomorrow.

2624
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:58,220
Oh,
a hero ligament pop.

2625
01:52:58,221 --> 01:53:03,221
Oh Shit.
I'm going to be fucked up to my better 

2626
01:53:03,221 --> 01:53:03,221
tap.
You know,

2627
01:53:03,221 --> 01:53:03,760
it's anticipation and we really,
you really put the,

2628
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:04,440
put it,
you know,

2629
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:07,270
black and white men.
That's kind of funny because that's what

2630
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:12,280
it is.
It's the faster the person tabs to the 

2631
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:12,470
earlier he was broke and once you break 
it,

2632
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:17,530
you're looking at the.
You're anticipating what you think's 

2633
01:53:17,530 --> 01:53:17,530
going to happen to you.
That's what it is.

2634
01:53:17,530 --> 01:53:21,470
Yeah.
I had a Jimmy Smith on the podcast 

2635
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:23,811
earlier today.
We were talking about he's the guy does 

2636
01:53:23,811 --> 01:53:26,131
a commentary for Bella tour and we were 
talking about when Jacques Rey fought 

2637
01:53:26,131 --> 01:53:29,961
hydro gracie and got his arm broken and 
then tucked it into his belt and 

2638
01:53:30,571 --> 01:53:35,571
defended for the last minute with a 
fucking broken arm so that he could win 

2639
01:53:35,571 --> 01:53:35,571
on points.
I mean,

2640
01:53:35,571 --> 01:53:38,970
this dude like let him break his arm.
He knew he was getting out is like,

2641
01:53:38,971 --> 01:53:43,971
but I'm not tapping.
Hajib broke his arm and he just tucked 

2642
01:53:43,971 --> 01:53:46,290
that shit right in his belt and just 
start a fight with the other arm.

2643
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:47,770
And did he win that fight?
He won that.

2644
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:51,560
He won that fight with a broken arm,
which is,

2645
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:52,920
you know,
Tim Sylvia,

2646
01:53:52,921 --> 01:53:56,250
when Frank Mir broke his arm,
you know Tim Silvia was trying to.

2647
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:58,380
It was making sure that they didn't stop
the fight.

2648
01:53:58,380 --> 01:53:59,110
He was telling her,
Dean,

2649
01:53:59,220 --> 01:54:00,510
do not stop this fight.
Let me,

2650
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:04,490
let me keep fighting his forearm.
Just got sad discipline Broka,

2651
01:54:05,490 --> 01:54:06,680
and he was like,
you know,

2652
01:54:06,690 --> 01:54:07,620
whatever,
I'm,

2653
01:54:07,621 --> 01:54:12,621
I'm fucking.
I'm going to hit them with the other 

2654
01:54:12,621 --> 01:54:12,621
hand.
Let me back in there.

2655
01:54:12,621 --> 01:54:15,830
That's all about focus.
I think that's about focusing on what 

2656
01:54:15,830 --> 01:54:18,711
you want to do.
What are you focused on when you're in 

2657
01:54:18,711 --> 01:54:18,711
there?
Yeah.

2658
01:54:18,711 --> 01:54:21,081
Are you focused on losing?
Are you focused on getting out of there 

2659
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:23,700
without being injured or are you focused
on finding a way to win no matter what?

2660
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:24,790
That's,
that's,

2661
01:54:24,990 --> 01:54:26,520
that's the thing,
and it's a big thing.

2662
01:54:26,850 --> 01:54:31,230
One of the most impressive fights that I
ever saw where a guy lost the fight,

2663
01:54:31,231 --> 01:54:32,310
but I'm like,
damn,

2664
01:54:32,311 --> 01:54:36,570
this motherfucker is trying to win this 
fight was when uriah faber broke,

2665
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:40,050
broke both his hands on Mike Brown.

2666
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:41,810
He had no hands.
Oh,

2667
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:45,330
and by the second round he broke both 
his hands.

2668
01:54:45,331 --> 01:54:50,331
He broke his thumb on one hand,
he broke his knuckles on the other hand 

2669
01:54:50,331 --> 01:54:53,510
so he couldn't punch with either hand.
So he's throwing elbows and he's 

2670
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:54,840
throwing kicks and he did it for five 
fucking rounds.

2671
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:57,720
Oh yeah.
He couldn't do anything.

2672
01:54:57,750 --> 01:54:59,410
He couldn't,
couldn't grab a hold of them,

2673
01:54:59,411 --> 01:55:01,560
couldn't hold on to him,
couldn't grapple,

2674
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:02,320
couldn't,
you know,

2675
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:06,540
all he could do was try and throw elbows
and try to take them out with kicks,

2676
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:11,900
but he still never complained.
And when there and tried to win every 

2677
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:15,480
minute of every round he had left,
you know,

2678
01:55:15,481 --> 01:55:17,160
I'm,
I'm a big fan of that.

2679
01:55:17,190 --> 01:55:22,190
And every now and then a guy will pull 
that shit off like rich Franklin when 

2680
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:25,221
he,
when he knocked out chuck chuck broke 

2681
01:55:25,221 --> 01:55:26,040
his arm and rich had a broken arm and he
punched chuck with a broken arm.

2682
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:29,720
You know,
I'm really now know there's,

2683
01:55:29,780 --> 01:55:34,780
there's moments like that where guys,
even in the face of that kind of an 

2684
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:36,180
injury,
figure out a way to pull it off.

2685
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:38,350
Those are special moments,
man.

2686
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:40,340
Yeah,
that's,

2687
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:43,970
that's what we mean is man,
that is what I'm going to write about.

2688
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:44,910
