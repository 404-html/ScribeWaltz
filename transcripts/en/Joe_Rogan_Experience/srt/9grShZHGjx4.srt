00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,201
Well,

3
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:04,034
that's nature man.

4
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,640
She just so creepy and it's,

5
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,060
it's ways of adjusting to life.

6
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,160
My friend and dress Antonopoulos,

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,500
uh,

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:12,840
my,

9
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,241
my friend,

10
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:16,060
the bitcoin expert explained
this to me last weekend in Vegas.

11
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:21,390
Ducks have three foot long dicks that
curl and twist because the female vaginas

12
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,320
have adapted to fight off rape.

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,490
Duck rape.

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:30,790
Yeah.

15
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,020
So they have these pussies that are the,

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,670
these fucking laboratories,

17
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,760
these twisty turny,

18
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:41,761
elaborative pussies and they
can choose to let sperm in,

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,640
are not let sperm in with
their gigantic labyrinth,

20
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:48,880
pussies and these three
foot long duck dicks.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,690
When you see a duck's deck you like,

22
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:50,920
Whoa,

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,180
that is not real.

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,500
Look at that ducks deck.

25
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,933
That's a drawing.

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,230
That's a drawing.

27
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:57,700
But there's actual photograph.

28
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:59,260
That's an actual photograph of a duct.

29
00:00:59,261 --> 00:00:59,650
Dick.

30
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,030
What in the fuck?

31
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,510
That's like a person but
like a 15 foot long dick.

32
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:04,870
Yeah.

33
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,840
Ducks are tiny man horse trailer deck.

34
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,310
Like a person with a three
foot dick is a monster.

35
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,730
But a duck with a three foot
long dick is totally standard.

36
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:14,010
That's a deck that's a Olympian.

37
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,161
That's guy's a little,

38
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:15,581
a little deck.

39
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:17,050
He gets shamed by the other ducks.

40
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,010
Poor guy.

41
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,281
Yeah.

42
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:20,290
I mean duct dicks are ridiculous.

43
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,040
They're,

44
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,690
it's a fucking ridiculous animal.

45
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,260
What docs,

46
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,400
I knew the ducks engaged in rape,

47
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,270
gang rape.

48
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,361
Oh,

49
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:29,194
that's all they do.

50
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,970
The ceiling gang up on one.

51
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,600
Look out.

52
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,510
Look how the,

53
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:37,511
the female's vagina has sort of
adapted to deal with the male raping,

54
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:40,301
you know,

55
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:43,420
created these bizarre
pathways in their pussies.

56
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,220
Yeah,

57
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:44,401
no,

58
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,071
a mighty mouse is,

59
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:45,601
he's a,

60
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:46,220
he's interesting.

61
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,050
I know you've been a big fan of him and
I've always enjoyed watching that guy.

62
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,340
I mean I can't fight like that guy,

63
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:54,060
but to watch some of his techniques and
the way you use angles and footwork and

64
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,770
how he lures you in
and his clinch game is,

65
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:57,604
is uh,

66
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,493
is nasty.

67
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,903
Just nasty.

68
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,450
You know,

69
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:00,871
I wonder,

70
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,030
and maybe you could give
some insight on this.

71
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,080
Like you used to fight at one 55 and now
you've got to cut to get down to one 45

72
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:07,171
year.

73
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:08,004
A pretty big guy.

74
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,920
But mighty mouse is not a big guy.

75
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,210
And I always wonder like,

76
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,530
could a guy like good a light
heavyweight or a middleweight even,

77
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,190
could they possibly even fight like
him or is that a gravity thing?

78
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,811
Like is it,

79
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:22,650
is part of what's going on with him?

80
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:23,970
The fact that he's so light,

81
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,100
like he can move faster,

82
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,160
he's got like more options as
far as like what he can do.

83
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,800
Some people were a blessed with a better
integrated and their body such as like

84
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:34,700
a neutral spine.

85
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,010
A lot of people have like lumbar
problems in neutral spine.

86
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,390
You ever watch Mayweather?

87
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:38,991
He,

88
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:42,800
you don't ever see them lean and he's
just always in constantly good posture and

89
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:43,634
good position.

90
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,840
And just like in wrestling,

91
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:45,920
if you're in good position,

92
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,270
more than likely you're
gonna win the fight.

93
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,351
Mighty mouse,

94
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:50,870
he just has that type of movement
and integrates his whole body.

95
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,340
His body moves as one,

96
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,600
it doesn't work against them.

97
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:55,670
There's not like a lot of
rattle in his body safe.

98
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:56,504
He throws a kick,

99
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,860
he doesn't land awkward.

100
00:02:57,861 --> 00:02:58,310
He doesn't,

101
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,570
yeah,

102
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,050
it goes,

103
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,610
he goes right back to a neutral base
and he's able to laterally move and

104
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,380
constantly have his body working for him.

105
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,030
So I think him naturally,

106
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:10,510
he just has that type of
gifts and benefits of his
body's able to integrate his

107
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,680
body to work as one.

108
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,741
Therefore you,

109
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:15,310
you don't waste a lot of energy
has really fluid movement.

110
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:15,671
Look at,

111
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:16,160
uh,

112
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,160
a guy like Anderson Silva.

113
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:21,110
He's able to beat people just
by keeping his range and it,

114
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,600
and just his movement of his body.

115
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,080
He doesn't,

116
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,910
he doesn't swing like a Mark Hunt or,

117
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,050
or me where,

118
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:26,231
you know,

119
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:26,651
like I'll,

120
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:28,930
I'll throw a lot of powers
and normally I miss,

121
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:29,111
you know,

122
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm just trying to,

123
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,491
trying to reach them,

124
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:31,031
but them guys,

125
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:32,890
they just use fluid movement and that's,

126
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,760
I think some people are just blessed to
have that integrated in their body in a

127
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:39,010
good neutral spine and a good solid base.

128
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,380
And that's why they're able to
connect on their shots a lot more.

129
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:42,340
It's as competing,

130
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,001
disconnected,

131
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:43,151
like,

132
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:43,660
uh,

133
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,800
say like a short circuit.

134
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,451
If it,

135
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:46,510
if there's like a small,

136
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:47,800
like little detail,

137
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:48,640
like this cord right here,

138
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:49,181
say it's like,

139
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:52,210
it's like broken and you're not getting
like the full amount of energy as where

140
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,820
if you have a solid base
and a good good spine,

141
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:56,650
you know how to integrate
your body to use as one,

142
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,220
there's gonna be a lot more of a sturdier
connection and more flow and fluid

143
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:00,630
movement.

144
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,791
I mean,

145
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,210
it was,

146
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,511
it was,

147
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:02,080
uh,

148
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,370
it was tough doing the talk.

149
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,331
And then,

150
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:04,690
um,

151
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,040
whenever I got into Congo,

152
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,210
they told me I had the flu in London
and the doctors there and that's what I

153
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:11,410
feel like here to,

154
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,400
there can be tropical medical medicine
specialist here and they're probably

155
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:15,851
really great.

156
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:16,684
But I,

157
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,080
I would trust the doctor that's lived
in the climate of the tropical climate

158
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,160
around malaria that seen it.

159
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,850
That's true.

160
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,990
That knows all the symptoms,

161
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,540
well knows to look for it
because no one gets it over here.

162
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:25,871
Yeah.

163
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:27,340
And so whenever I got into Congo,

164
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,510
I flew from,

165
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,201
yeah.

166
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,420
From work to Congo.

167
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,380
And whenever I landed,

168
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,000
instead of going straight to the forest,

169
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,730
they took me to like a air strip at a,

170
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,300
uh,

171
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,710
kind of hospital in the middle of nowhere.

172
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:39,521
Um,

173
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:40,354
so I landed,

174
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,970
went straight to the hospital and
then right there they're like,

175
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:43,601
you don't have the flu,

176
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:44,410
you have malaria.

177
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:44,801
And I'm like,

178
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:45,250
but I,

179
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,083
I've been,

180
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,500
I've been in the states,

181
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,000
I just fought and then I have,

182
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:49,750
uh,

183
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,040
and then I was in Europe.

184
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,090
Like there's no,

185
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,200
no malaria really there,

186
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,510
but it was because it's
still living inside me.

187
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:56,021
There's like,

188
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:56,500
um,

189
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,490
I think there's three strands.

190
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:58,750
One live in your body for three years,

191
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,584
five years.

192
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
I think the other is like
30 to life or something.

193
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,634
Why?

194
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,130
Yeah.

195
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,660
And so,

196
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,840
so it just comes back.

197
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,070
Yeah.

198
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,360
Can like when your body's really rundown,

199
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,410
when you're really tired,

200
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:11,140
immune systems low like
training for a fight.

201
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:11,740
Yeah.

202
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,510
Like training for a fight
or right after the fight,

203
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,591
right off the fight,

204
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:15,580
went to London and spoke,

205
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,540
then I went to Congo.

206
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,550
But right after the fight.

207
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,920
So you recovering from malaria,

208
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,750
you go through your six week fight camp,

209
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,830
you have your fight,

210
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,000
you're run down.

211
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,770
And then after the fight
you got malaria again.

212
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,690
Yes.

213
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:27,970
Uh,

214
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,560
now those sickness.

215
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,320
Yeah.

216
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,540
I,

217
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,410
I've had it now three times.

218
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,251
Oh my God.

219
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,840
So at least confirm twice.

220
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,250
The third time they're like,

221
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:36,431
yeah,

222
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:37,091
you have it for sure.

223
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:37,924
But the,

224
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,620
with malaria you have to get the test,

225
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:45,550
the blood test while you have a
certain degree temperature like fever,

226
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:45,971
uh,

227
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,530
whenever it's cycling out of your liver,

228
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,653
I mean coming out.

229
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,000
Um,

230
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,700
they have to draw the blood
at that exact time to get it.

231
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:55,030
And so that's why I was misdiagnosed
four times in the Congo.

232
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:56,170
And um,

233
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,830
what a sneaky fucking disease.

234
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,041
Yeah,

235
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:58,401
it's nuts.

236
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:59,151
It's crazy.

237
00:05:59,151 --> 00:05:59,900
Cause they'll,

238
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,630
they'll hide in your liver and then they
send them out in your bloodstream like

239
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:02,870
a,

240
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,800
like a platoon.

241
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,130
They go and wreck havoc and then
they retreat right back to the liver.

242
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,611
Really?

243
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah.

244
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,350
They live in your liver?

245
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,621
Yeah.

246
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:13,100
That's where they're hiding away
for three or five or 30 years.

247
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,240
Oh my God.

248
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:14,960
And what does,

249
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,070
is there any solution?

250
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,300
Is there anything they could do?

251
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:17,960
Um,

252
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,793
I don't think so.

253
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,440
And I had a couple things
that happened where,

254
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,663
um,

255
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,031
you know,

256
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:23,111
I,

257
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:26,390
I started trying to take the anti
malaria meds but I started getting,

258
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,840
it's the only medicine I've ever really
reacted to where getting nauseous start

259
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:30,561
dragging him heard.

260
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,270
It's awful.

261
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,550
Yeah.

262
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,383
Even uh,

263
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,223
even um,

264
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,830
oh I'm pasty white and I
get real sun sensitive.

265
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,460
Um,

266
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,070
I know another medicine
called method when um,

267
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,933
which is uh,

268
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,550
I think it's developed
in Switzerland or Sweden,

269
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,310
supposed to be an awesome
new malaria medicine.

270
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,890
It's actually the one thing
my body kind of responds to.

271
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,143
But um,

272
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,420
but it's actually really
dangerous because a,

273
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,970
I've seen people that are there for aid
work and different stuff and do they

274
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:56,570
have to,

275
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,850
they have to retreat if they're
there with kids and stuff,

276
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,340
they moved there to the
country they're taking off.

277
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,340
Cause I'm cause Kiddos or even adults
have mental breaks that they can't come

278
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:07,281
back from.

279
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:09,260
Like you can have psychotic episodes for,

280
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,900
I think they said like if
it lasts longer than a week,

281
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,500
it's probably in the last like three
months to last longer than three months.

282
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,520
It's probably the last forever.

283
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,673
Wow.

284
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,441
So I'm,

285
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:19,820
so this is from the medication?

286
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:19,980
Yeah.

287
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,920
Just the medication and
it gives you terrible,

288
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,270
terrible nightmares.

289
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,210
I almost went to Tanzania this summer.

290
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,620
What was going to go on safari and too
many people scare the shit out of me with

291
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:31,460
malaria talk.

292
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,390
Yeah.

293
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,800
I was going to take my
whole family and I'm like,

294
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:33,981
look,

295
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:34,820
I'll take some malaria,

296
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,380
malaria medication and feel like shit.

297
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,850
I'm not giving it to my six year old.

298
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,320
Yeah.

299
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,720
It's just,

300
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,530
it's not happening.

301
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,160
That would be,

302
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,690
I'm not doing enough when you yeah,

303
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,370
but that's a real concern.

304
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:43,641
Right?

305
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:45,020
Tanzania has malaria as well,

306
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:45,530
right?

307
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:45,711
Yeah,

308
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:46,041
they do.

309
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,680
It's it because it's more of a,

310
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,540
was that arid climate more?

311
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,973
It's,

312
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,120
they have less there.

313
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,680
It's not so tropical there.

314
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:57,500
I've been to Tanzania a couple
of times and Sam's a bar.

315
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:57,741
I mean,

316
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:58,101
it's just,

317
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:58,934
um,

318
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,100
I,

319
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,721
it wasn't there,

320
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:01,630
but I was saw it and it was a,

321
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,081
I don't know,

322
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:03,501
I mean it's,

323
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:04,460
it's a crazy,

324
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:08,720
crazy place because you go from Congo
where they have all these tropical

325
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,100
diseases and you go,

326
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:10,740
I don't know,

327
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,421
the same continent.

328
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:12,231
You just go over a little bit.

329
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:13,580
And there's all these
other kinds of parasites.

330
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:14,750
Like in Congo,

331
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,340
they have very little of a,

332
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,310
I believe they're cold.

333
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,280
Um,

334
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,130
jiggers with a j and m it said chicken.

335
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,760
It's very careful when you say that word,

336
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,600
but jiggers with a j he's wrong.

337
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,000
It sounds like you should stop.

338
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:31,631
But they,

339
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:32,370
they,

340
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,370
they're these crazy parasites at burrow
in your feet and especially kids and

341
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:38,834
elderly.

342
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,410
Um,

343
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,420
and especially my kids and elderly.

344
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,373
Um,

345
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,131
well,

346
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:43,551
honestly,

347
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:44,900
I think one reason with poverty,

348
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,410
uh,

349
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,770
the kids don't get shoes until
they can work in by him and a,

350
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:49,640
the elderly,

351
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,710
if they're not able to work
and provide for themselves.

352
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,670
And you know,

353
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:53,720
it's harder for them to,

354
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,360
to,

355
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,290
to get shoes and stuff,

356
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,790
but also it's just the,

357
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,600
where they live.

358
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,080
Um,

359
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,370
because on the sandy,

360
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,210
or it's either sandy or the clay ish,

361
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,650
um,

362
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,740
we're silty soil that's
real red and Uganda,

363
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,461
man,

364
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,220
it just wreaks havoc on this kids to where
they're having to have people come in

365
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:09,930
every week to different villages,

366
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,170
sit there with a safety pins and all sorts
of these looks that they dig into the

367
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,830
people's feeds and,

368
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:17,220
um,

369
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,911
Oh God,

370
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:18,121
dude,

371
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,420
it's,

372
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,350
it's painful.

373
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,880
Whenever I've seen people getting it done,

374
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,230
you're literally putting there,

375
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,530
and I've had one in my foot
and it kind of came and gone.

376
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,581
It's not that bad one,

377
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:27,414
it's just one.

378
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,870
But whenever your whole foot
or your whole heel or all the,

379
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,361
you know,

380
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:33,780
the balls of your feet
are just covered in,

381
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,261
I mean,

382
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:34,951
I'm talking 20,

383
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:35,251
30,

384
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:35,581
40,

385
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:37,650
50 of these parasites.

386
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,851
They're just brutal.

387
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:41,670
So every step you see
them when they're walking,

388
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,360
the grimacing,

389
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,830
when you're taking it out there screaming,

390
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,800
God damn Africa

391
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,410
[inaudible].
