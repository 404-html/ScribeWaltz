1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,300
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,210
This is how I picture Andre Rise and
went to work every day when he played for

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:13,080
the Atlanta Falcons.

5
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:14,100
I don't even know who that is.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:14,821
Just rolling it.

7
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:19,821
Well he's a pro bowl NFL wide receiver
who spent just crazy money like 30 bloats

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,720
rolling and cars and shit.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,011
Yeah,

10
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:24,180
like he blew through a lot of it.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,200
He was on that broke um,

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,710
special that they air
and he was just like,

13
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,000
if somebody pulled up,

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,720
you know,

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,370
and like a Ferrari,

16
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,061
you're like,

17
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:33,181
yeah,

18
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:33,960
that's just hot.

19
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,160
I got to top that shit.

20
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,360
So then he would go like the day,

21
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,750
that day I got the land by
what the brains blown out man.

22
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,140
Like just to top each other guys
would just buy shit to show off,

23
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:43,740
you know,

24
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,970
to compete with each other on it.

25
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,080
They say that there's some
ungodly number of people.

26
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,140
It's like 80% of all NFL players or
broke in bankruptcy within two years of

27
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:55,590
retiring.

28
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,770
It's,

29
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,640
it's incredible.

30
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,180
I mean,

31
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,481
you know,

32
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:58,470
the older I get,

33
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:03,471
the more I understand the younger guys
having no like 0 million cents and also

34
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:06,540
zero if like financial Iq,

35
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,490
like they don't know the 21 they're like,

36
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,200
here's $3 million.

37
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,720
And they're like,

38
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,553
Ooh.

39
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:15,720
Yeah,

40
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,381
I can imagine.

41
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:16,950
It's crazy.

42
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,660
But it's crazier when they're like,

43
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:23,661
he played 10 1216 years like Iverson and
he's blown through like $200 million.

44
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:27,150
And you're like,

45
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,810
I'm broke now.

46
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,470
Yes.

47
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,303
Yes.

48
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,383
And how old is he now?

49
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,760
He's 37 something like that.

50
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,170
His body's not working right anymore.

51
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,321
Oh,

52
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:35,220
he's down of the NBA.

53
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:35,610
Yeah.

54
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,443
And he's,

55
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,770
and he's trying to play in,

56
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:41,730
but he's running through
well into nine figures,

57
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,330
you know?

58
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,170
Wow.

59
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,501
I mean,

60
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:43,681
I,

61
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:43,951
you know,

62
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:44,700
and that's,

63
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,391
and that's,

64
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:45,661
you know,

65
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:46,291
you have to consider,

66
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,060
he made a lot of endorsements.

67
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,410
So nine figures,

68
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,020
nine figures to make seven figures.

69
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,560
Yeah.

70
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,250
Girls would be like,

71
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:53,730
wow,

72
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,870
he makes seven figures.

73
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:55,411
It's like,

74
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:57,940
can't make nine nine I blew two.

75
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:58,500
It all.

76
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,950
Yeah,

77
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,180
that shit crazy,

78
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:00,451
man.

79
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:03,770
Woopsies it's crazy that

80
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,810
it's so much.

81
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,130
They,

82
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,120
they interviewed one defensive,

83
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,590
like a guy on the,

84
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:11,250
on the,

85
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,310
the special on the Brooke
thing and he was like,

86
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,121
I don't know why man.

87
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:15,810
But he was like,

88
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,040
everybody had a car wash.

89
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,763
Okay,

90
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,750
we all had a fuck carwash man.

91
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,290
That shit.

92
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,820
That shit did not last.

93
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:30,070
Like we all spent money on a car.

94
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:31,840
We bought a car wash.

95
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:32,501
Yeah man,

96
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:33,980
you ain't got your own carwash.

97
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,860
And Bart Scott had the,

98
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,793
he was like,

99
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,511
you buy shit.

100
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:38,081
It's unnecessary.

101
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:39,520
He's not broke at all.

102
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,020
And he's still playing and he's like,

103
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:42,280
I'm smarter with my money.

104
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:42,881
But he's like,

105
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:43,001
you know,

106
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,170
everybody has a stupid purchase.

107
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:44,950
I bought a coat,

108
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,120
I think it was made a wolf.

109
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,590
Like I wore that shit once and it was
like $35,000 you can wear a wolf collide.

110
00:02:58,781 --> 00:02:59,950
I think man

111
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,200
Christ,

112
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,270
I get wolf coat.

113
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,960
That's admirable and you're loving it.

114
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:05,381
Look at you.

115
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,240
You can't be happier.

116
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,690
It's not possible to be happier than you.

117
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,430
I handle somewhere between that
too pissed and somewhat pissed.

118
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,620
That's how you idle your bullshit.

119
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,461
You said that earlier.

120
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,050
It's like you saying that
you're hard to work with.

121
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,620
I don't think I've hard to work
that hard to work hard to change.

122
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,300
I bet your fight against
someone trying to manipulate or,

123
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,400
or directly

124
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:28,960
do.

125
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,650
I remember,

126
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,650
I remember when we were picking for
a jury recently about a year ago,

127
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:37,990
um,

128
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,990
and they were picking for a murder trial
over in the Pasadena courthouse and the

129
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:44,060
Fellas is,

130
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:44,380
uh,

131
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,030
is there anybody here who isn't going
to get themselves disqualifies there?

132
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,980
Anybody here who's qualified to,

133
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,150
uh,

134
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,020
try this case?

135
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:56,240
And I was the only one who
raised his hand really.

136
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,721
So,

137
00:03:58,721 --> 00:03:59,220
uh,

138
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,870
you know,

139
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,680
um,

140
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,513
you know,

141
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,710
I'm willing to listen.

142
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,480
And the guy says,

143
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:04,900
uh,

144
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,733
okay sir.

145
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,610
He says,

146
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:06,880
uh,

147
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,290
I think I know who you are.

148
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,450
He says,

149
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,283
um,

150
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:10,600
oh,

151
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,890
would you listen to everybody else's
idea behind while you're deliberating on

152
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:17,290
this trial instead of certainly he said,

153
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,030
but you would try to convince them they
were wrong if you had another idea,

154
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:22,391
right?

155
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:23,224
And I said,

156
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:23,711
yes,

157
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:24,544
that's accurate.

158
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,743
And you dismiss it.

159
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,070
Charismatic,

160
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,720
charismatic.

161
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,270
You had manipulated in your favor.

162
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,290
Well,

163
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,123
you're the lever.

164
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,480
Certainly not my one.

165
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:39,830
My first time in the Pasadena courthouse,

166
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,201
you know,

167
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:42,660
when our first time was Alex van Halen,

168
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:47,661
and I had to sue the Mayfield School of
the holy child of Jesus Incorporated for

169
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:49,230
$125.

170
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,190
This was in 1975,

171
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:53,551
I think.

172
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:55,490
1970 625.

173
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,250
What was that about?

174
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,611
Well,

175
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:57,810
it was in a contract.

176
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:58,890
We had played a,

177
00:04:58,891 --> 00:04:59,551
a,

178
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:04,230
a dance and in the one page contract
it said there will be no smoking,

179
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,370
uh,

180
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,240
backstage.

181
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:08,520
There will be no marijuana consumed.

182
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:09,810
There will be no drinking,

183
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:10,321
et Cetera,

184
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:11,154
cetera.

185
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:11,910
And uh,

186
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,060
one of the sisters was nuns at the time,

187
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:20,390
claimed that she smelled
pot smoke backstage and a
refused to pass our hundred

188
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:22,710
and $25 for the band.

189
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:23,940
So agree.

190
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,301
Bitch,

191
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:25,140
was he she right?

192
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:25,950
Well,

193
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,370
no,

194
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,890
there was no pot smoke,

195
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:28,200
but she,

196
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,033
she's made it up.

197
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,720
She may have smelled Marlboro's actually
those were Campbell Campbell filters.

198
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,561
But,

199
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:35,270
um,

200
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,610
uh,

201
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,260
Alex and I went and we bought a clip on
ties so we could fool the judge and we

202
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:43,620
tied our hair back and we went
to small claims court and filed.

203
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,340
Did you win?

204
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,173
Um,

205
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:45,541
well,

206
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,410
what happened was,

207
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,520
uh,

208
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,660
sat in front of the judge.

209
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:50,520
We sat on one side and on the other side,

210
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,810
uh,

211
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,741
two sisters,

212
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:54,450
two nuns came in and a family,

213
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,141
a father,

214
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:55,974
a mother,

215
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,820
and three of daughters in school uniforms.

216
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,001
You know,

217
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,020
they played it up hard.

218
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:00,921
And,

219
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:01,211
uh,

220
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:02,420
the judge says,

221
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,800
why or who filed here?

222
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:04,101
I said,

223
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:04,341
sir,

224
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:04,761
I did.

225
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:06,710
He said it was $125.

226
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,270
And uh,

227
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,500
there was no smoke,

228
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,870
there was no smoking of
anything illegal backstage,

229
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:13,704
whatever.

230
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,773
And um,

231
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,131
he had the,

232
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,720
one of the nuns stand up and she said,

233
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,360
I refused to pay him because
I smelled marijuana smoke.

234
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,411
And,

235
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:21,800
uh,

236
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,551
the judge says,

237
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:23,600
what is your answer to that?

238
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:23,901
Sarah?

239
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:25,070
And I stood up and I said,

240
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,993
sister,

241
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,120
how do you know what
marijuana smoke smells like?

242
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,570
$125 later

243
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,660
paid for the t shirt.

244
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:35,811
Yeah.

245
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:36,644
How would she know?

246
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,600
I've heard you saying that you believe
that consciousness is nonlocal.

247
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,000
Alright,

248
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,990
what do you mean by that?

249
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:47,431
Well,

250
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:48,940
out of discontinuity.

251
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:49,820
See,

252
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,280
you are already familiar with this.

253
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,770
Continuated now you want
to know even the most,

254
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,600
most unfamiliar,

255
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,850
most intriguing,

256
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,450
you know,

257
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,950
they said this is like Voodoo.

258
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,720
This is really like Udo,

259
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:02,840
this,

260
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,500
we're now getting into fail cracks up.

261
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,800
The most surprising thing in quantum
physics that surprised you when Einstein,

262
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:09,971
Einstein,

263
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:14,320
and his whole life could not
believe this concept of nonlocality,

264
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:17,050
which he himself discovered
with two other physicists,

265
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:17,650
right and wrong.

266
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,410
How did they discover it or
how to discover just theory,

267
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,161
you know,

268
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:22,480
and standing what the tour addition,

269
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:23,314
he never,

270
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,820
well I shouldn't say never.

271
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:30,110
They probably did experiments in his
young days when he was a graduate student.

272
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,863
I did talk,

273
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,210
but tourists don't do an experiment.

274
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,541
No.

275
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,830
What they do is this,

276
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,740
a creative exploration of the mind.

277
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,990
By that day they find new ideas,

278
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,883
new ideas,

279
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,691
and then the,

280
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:44,260
then the predict stuff.

281
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,340
So Einstein's idea was this was 1935 mine.

282
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,340
Do I understand?

283
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,800
The idea was that if quantum objects
took quantum objects interact,

284
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,840
they become correlated.

285
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:59,260
And this is a new word
that he used in that paper.

286
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,640
He and his collaborators,

287
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,380
Rosen and Podolsky.

288
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,903
Um,

289
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,950
these people that really
sound in with their theory,

290
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,970
their mathematics,

291
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,360
that if two objects
once become correlated,

292
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,040
they,

293
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,180
even when they are not interacting,

294
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,120
even if they move away from each other,

295
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,030
even then they can communicate,

296
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,370
not in the usual way,

297
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,650
not interacting with signals,

298
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,910
then that still shrill.

299
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,890
You and I are interacting right now,

300
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,240
but we are interacting to a complexity
of sound waves and electrical wires to

301
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:35,110
this microphones.

302
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,890
That's all true signals.

303
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,450
But these objects
communicate without signals.

304
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,300
So their communication,

305
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:50,050
he was as a medium that can only be
outside of space and time because in space

306
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:50,561
and time,

307
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:53,770
Einstein himself gave us
the theory of relativity,

308
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:58,771
which says that nothing can interact
without exchanging signals going to space

309
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,234
and time.

310
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,890
But these objects,

311
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:02,790
quantum objects,

312
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,810
one scar related,

313
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,020
they have the capacity of
signal less communication.

314
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,560
This is what is called [inaudible]
local signals that local going to space

315
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,170
taking it.

316
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,710
How do they,

317
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,640
how do they measure that these
particles are communicating?

318
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,720
So the key is in that they measure
the communication and the soul,

319
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:26,310
that there is no signal because the
communication took place faster than the

320
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:31,311
speed of light in all local signals going
to space and time must travel either

321
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:35,370
at the speed of light or
less than the speed of light.

322
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,870
So if something can be shown to
travel faster than the speed of light,

323
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,700
it has to be local.

324
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:47,090
And this is a 56 loud discovered into
laboratory Atlanta stay in 1982 finally

325
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:53,400
verified by Einstein was dead long time
ago around 10 55 so he never knew that

326
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:57,540
he's teary will one day
not only prove to variety,

327
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,140
but really the evolutionize,

328
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:03,000
the whole world of physics by
bringing in concepts of consciousness,

329
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,500
the Joe Rogan experience

330
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,290
[inaudible].
