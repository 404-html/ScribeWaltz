1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,090
We live about is about,
we're talking about g Gordon Liddy,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,173
so gigo this episode of Miami Vice was a
sergeant in Vietnam and right when 

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,950
Saigon fell,
he held onto 300 kilos of pure heroin.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,410
He took it to the United States and dead
bodies.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,930
This is what the episode's about.
Nineteen 86.

6
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:19,764
Miami Vice.
They bring it to Miami and he sat on it 

7
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,380
for 20 years until the value with all 
the way up,

8
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:28,140
just like an investment and then he let 
it loose,

9
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:30,130
but by that time it had gotten 
contaminated.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,020
Started killing junkies all up and down 
the east coast when a brilliant episode.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,060
So they had to go in and dig for g dot 
Gordon Liddy and this motherfucker shows

12
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,210
up right for like this board meeting and
that's when I had to leave the house.

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,220
He shows up to this board and he's like,
yeah,

14
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,480
the heroin was my boss.

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,483
He,
because I guarantee they called them 

16
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:49,860
sergeant real estate and in the episode 
he goes,

17
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:51,420
I guess you guys forget who the hell I 
am.

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,780
He turns around,
he goes in his briefcase and he throws a

19
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:56,670
chain or is on the table when he walks 
out.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Oh,
that's it.

21
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,540
That's the episode.
Tremendous.

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,830
Haiti,
what?

23
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,960
This is [inaudible] 86 to seven percent 
on Miami.

24
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:06,570
This is way before American gangster was
talking about it.

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,823
This was already out that they were 
bringing Vietnam heroin and dead bodies 

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,080
and that's how the episode starts to 
report.

27
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,190
It takes Don Johnson to the morgue and 
he opens it up from Vietnam and he goes,

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,330
this is your friend.
Stick your hand,

29
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,470
and it was just pure heroin.
That was what they did,

30
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:23,700
right?
What they were doing towards.

31
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,200
Yeah.
I don't know at the beginning that was,

32
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:28,530
but it was really the CIA that blaming 
it all on some black guy from that

33
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,441
Harlem.
Well,

34
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:30,520
you know,
there's a guy named Mr.

35
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,900
Nice.
I forget what his name is.

36
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:36,520
Something banks famous.
A drug dealer when he said was,

37
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:40,000
it wasn't the CIA.
What it was some people in the CIA.

38
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,020
He said it's some cowboys in the ca and 
that's what makes the most sense to me.

39
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,690
Like this idea that the big 
organization,

40
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:50,460
the CIO would be involved in drug 
smuggling seems like so crazy.

41
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,890
Joe Rogan.
It's too many,

42
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,920
many heads,
plenty of people,

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,570
plenty of people that did do it look 
like.

44
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,950
There's plenty of examples.
Like there's an example right now,

45
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,180
this thing called the Silk Road,
you know about the Silk Road.

46
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,523
The Silk Road was this underground drug 
dealing like network that this guy had 

47
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:09,640
created and they were just selling mad 
money.

48
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,430
Matt,
Matt drugs like underground and they had

49
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,520
created this thing like it's,
it's,

50
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,013
it's a total.
What it is is it operates like 

51
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:23,830
completely under the wire and these dea 
guys,

52
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,723
I think it was tea,
they infiltrated it and they got into 

53
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:27,370
the Silk Road.

54
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,740
One of the first things they did,
they started stealing money.

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,080
Now these guys are in jail.
They're going to jail right now.

56
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:32,914
They're,
they're in court right now and they're 

57
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:34,774
wondering like whether or not this case 
is even valid because these guys for 

58
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:42,841
sure had access to this guy's account 
and part of what they were trying to try

59
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:44,614
this guy on his,
his complicit in that he was complicit 

60
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:48,154
in the drug selling and there was also 
some possibility that people were 

61
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:52,300
murdered.
Although there was no body.

62
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,283
There's a lot of Kinky shit going on 
with this and the kinkiest part is that 

63
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,050
the agents were stealing money.
Bitcoins,

64
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,923
yes.
There were stealing of thousands of 

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,190
dollars in bitcoin.
So they,

66
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:04,130
they realized that there was a lot of 
value in this.

67
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:04,964
Like that shit is always gone on.
I think the reason why you have guys 

68
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,970
like this that are showing up in the 
Silk Road case,

69
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,240
there's always been cowboys,
but I think there's been good guys too.

70
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,470
There's been guys who were in the CIA 
that really did it for America.

71
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,970
I had this guy,
Michael Baker in them.

72
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,820
I'm pretty good at recognizing bullshit,
you know,

73
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:25,630
and he's a longtime CIA operative in a 
fucking great guy.

74
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,683
I mean,
he really does seem like he loves 

75
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,830
America,
like I don't think he's bullshitting.

76
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,030
I think there's a lot of those guys,
they get in those positions and they get

77
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,490
a group of them together just like they 
did with ramp part,

78
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,373
but those fucking bad cops,
they get a group of them together and 

79
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:40,930
go,
look what happened.

80
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,310
Oops.
Pop that out.

81
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,560
They get together.
Go look.

82
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,370
All these guys are making money.
Right?

83
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,563
Fuck them.
They're all criminals and scumbags and 

84
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:50,080
cons.
Let's just get some of this money,

85
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,240
man.
Let's just get some of this money.

86
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,980
Come on,
man.

87
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,813
You know,
we're going to stop these fucking 

88
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:54,941
people.
This is what we do.

89
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:57,190
We keep,
we keep throwing a few of them in jail.

90
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,000
We do whatever the fuck we got to do.
We were the were the gang here.

91
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:03,040
We got the law on our side.
Let's fucking make some money.

92
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,810
Well,
what's the CIA?

93
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,790
I shouldn't have said that.
You're absolutely right.

94
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,610
There was factions like,
yeah,

95
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,513
a brown bag,
like a black bag faction that wedding 

96
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,810
after,
uh,

97
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,480
the marines would go in and they shoot 
everybody and throw cards.

98
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,640
You know,
whatever the fuck it was when you have,

99
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:23,670
when you're shipping heroin from 
wherever the fuck that is considered all

100
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:24,874
the way to the United States through 
three or two different airports and 

101
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,490
people have to unload them and you have 
a,

102
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,600
you know,
whatever.

103
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:35,260
People walk into your plane when they 
first come in to inspect them.

104
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,330
That's a lot of people.
You got to grease.

105
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,233
It has to be somebody huge.
This isn't me and you get a boat and 

106
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,084
going to Columbia and paying some guy 
with me and read back and we just shoot 

107
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,620
across with police scanners and try our 
best to to make,

108
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,910
to infiltrate the.

109
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,140
To bring in that amount of heroin.
You have to spend a lot of dough.

110
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,453
That's where your costs come in.
That's where you set the wholesale and 

111
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,600
the retail prices.
You know,

112
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,760
years ago,
20 years ago,

113
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,960
they would,
they would smuggle it 60 miles and 70,

114
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,803
45,
50 miles in from the United States 

115
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:10,744
around Miami and they would dump it 
overboard with weights and 12 hours 

116
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:17,830
later the boom would explode and the 
bales would rise up and you'd come by,

117
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:18,664
a fishermen will come by and put the 
bales and meanwhile the dea was looking 

118
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:25,420
for that boat that was speeding across 
on their radar,

119
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,100
but they would throw,
you know,

120
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,240
that's,
that takes expensive equipment to devise

121
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:34,060
something to throw you 50 pounds of 
cocaine,

122
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,500
100 feet under the water.
And then 12 hours later everything blows

123
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,550
and your coke rises to the top.
And now some guy comes and just picks it

124
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:42,700
up.

125
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,660
This is brilliant stuff.
So this is what the Jay listens.

126
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,100
Really what they did.
That was one of the things.

127
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:51,370
They get old after a while to beat the 
federal government.

128
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:52,510
You got to,
you got.

129
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,650
And it doesn't listen,
man.

130
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,520
What,
uh,

131
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,430
what the budget is for fighting drugs 
and what a drug dealer spends a month.

132
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,070
I'm talking about a guy that's bringing 
in a thousand kilos a month,

133
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:05,300
the powder,
whether it be heroin or cocaine,

134
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,134
that's big powder.
Somebody has got to be turning around 

135
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,670
and they were flooding the market with 
heroin and I remember being a little boy

136
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:14,504
in New York and going to visit my 
godmother and my mother's friends and 

137
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,960
seeing people everywhere.
Not early.

138
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,330
New York to me was a fucking this shit 
that they.

139
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,340
What's the show now where people dead 
walking around Atlanta walking and I saw

140
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:32,360
that growing up.
I saw that growing up as a kid row where

141
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:35,330
they used to have in Harlem,
Spanish Harlem.

142
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,640
Harlem is scarier than all those.
You know,

143
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,440
they had people not,
not the lights.

144
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,080
People waiting to cross the street and 
they not at the fucking lie.

145
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,550
They don't have though in New York that 
they have here in La and New York.

146
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:49,660
All these cities of buildings,
there's like these streets have there.

147
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,160
Whether these were.
These people are.

148
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,770
It's like these are places where other 
folks go like,

149
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:55,830
you got all your homeless people.
He got,

150
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:56,501
you know,
your,

151
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:57,730
your,
your poor people.

152
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:01,030
But there's cars that go through those 
areas and it's,

153
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:01,864
you know,
it's well traveled like New York blends 

154
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:04,444
more.
La has these blocks that are just 

155
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:09,670
homeless people.
And when I mean just homeless people,

156
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,983
I'm talking thousands,
like they're literally might be a 

157
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,950
thousand pounds on this block.
Oh Dude.

158
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,843
You've seen them.
Oh yeah.

159
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,953
You get,
you make a wrong turn and you get right 

160
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,860
in the middle.
It's a Michael Jackson video.

161
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,750
It really is.
It's insane.

162
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,950
In downtown,
there's a.

163
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,173
well they call skid row.
It's actually says if you go on Google 

164
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:31,864
maps and type skid row in Los Angeles,
it actually says skid row and there's a 

165
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:35,950
like a mile long.

166
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,130
I mean it's a couple blocks launch.
It's a lot.

167
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,950
There's a lot of it.
There's more than one area.

168
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,053
There's like one long street.
But we used to work when we did fear 

169
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:46,144
factor,
we used to work in these buildings and 

170
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:48,934
these buildings were,
a lot of them abandoned textile 

171
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:51,244
buildings or they were renting amount.
So we're American apparel actually is 

172
00:07:54,401 --> 00:07:55,270
made.
It's really weird.

173
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,313
We were in the American apparel factory.
We had to go through the American 

174
00:07:58,871 --> 00:07:59,704
apparel factory to the get to the roof.
We've watched them like make their 

175
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:03,010
clothes,
you know,

176
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:04,840
they're like,
they do make them in downtown La.

177
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:06,610
It's like one of the things they pride 
themselves on.

178
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,473
Jesus.
Fuck.

179
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,080
Fucking frys Joey.
Yes.

180
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,120
But we would go to the top of these,
um,

181
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,800
hang up on a Jesus Christ.
He checked into the fucking is the.

182
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,180
I'm sorry.
That's all right.

183
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,150
We would go to the top of these 
buildings and you could,

184
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,130
you could literally,
there was areas where,

185
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,650
you know,
you could see them like leaking out into

186
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:29,890
the rest is treats and if you drove down
there who drove down the street,

187
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:31,930
I'm not bullshitting.
You would see hundreds,

188
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,230
hundreds of homeless people just 
swarming the streets.

189
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,230
And there's these areas where they have 
like,

190
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:40,480
um,
it's crazy.

191
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:41,271
Joey,
they,

192
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,104
they have these areas where they have 
like they give them food or they have 

193
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,010
areas where they can get medical 
assistance,

194
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,740
stuff like that.
And those areas are particularly dense.

195
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,743
Now when I shot Myp,
the blue eye shadow at a downtown 

196
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:56,050
location,
that's the pool hall kind

197
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,800
of shorter and they had time to homeless
people.

198
00:08:58,801 --> 00:08:59,634
When I was standing there,
I heard people going in talking about 

199
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:05,790
how they had day rentals.
The government would pay for 15 days and

200
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,640
they'd be out in the street for 15 days 
like that,

201
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,830
but I didn't see that look advil.
This is,

202
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,760
this seems mild compared to what I saw.
When was this?

203
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:18,420
What year is this come?
Maybe they've cleaned it up a little.

204
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:18,950
Well,
it's.

205
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,730
It's also during the day I've gotten 
through the night.

206
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,680
Oh yeah.
Curious.

207
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,710
Go back.
What?

208
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,553
I want to see what the statistics were 
good people in every city and it's out 

209
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:32,490
of proportion and some cities more than 
others.

210
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,970
Pause on that for a second.
Skid row's near downtown La.

211
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,803
Two thousand sensors.
The population of the district was 

212
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:40,990
7,740.
Skid row is defined as,

213
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,410
oh my God,
what the fuck does that mean?

214
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,680
Does it defined in a decision by Jones 
versus city of Los Angeles?

215
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,543
The area east of main street,
south of Third Street and west of 

216
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:53,310
Alameda Street,
so it's kind of like a block.

217
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,090
It's like an area,
but that area has 17,000

218
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,650
homeless people.
Is that right?

219
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,200
That's a Goddamn Kevin Hart concert.

220
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,890
That's Kevin.
Kevin,

221
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,810
Kevin Hart sold out Madison Square 
Garden.

222
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:12,440
Three fucking shows in a row.
He's a monster.

223
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,780
Comedies on and off time.
Huh?

224
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,860
She's the biggest comedian of all time.
Kevin.

225
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:19,680
No one's ever been as big as Kevin Hart.
As far as like popularity.

226
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,200
No one even close.
I can't think of one person.

227
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,720
I think there's a couple of guys that 
got up to that edge,

228
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,330
but I think he's totally taken it to a 
totally different stratosphere.

229
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,310
Like Dane got pretty far.
He got on that edge,

230
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,443
louise on that edge,
but Kevin Hart is routinely doing these 

231
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:36,120
crazy arena shows.
He's doing 40,000

232
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:36,954
plus people who sold 40,000
plus tickets are ready for a show in 

233
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:42,750
philly where he's filming a special 
dude.

234
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,260
It's just total next level positive 
energy shit.

235
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,243
And if you go to that kid's a instagram 
page is instagram is all about like 

236
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,990
positive,
like energy,

237
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:54,210
like get going to work.
I'm doing what I love to do.

238
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:56,190
I'm working.
Shows him in the gym,

239
00:10:56,191 --> 00:11:00,960
putting work in five days with people 
and they see that they would chase them.

240
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:01,794
Last week in Boston,
I flew into the five fucking reality 

241
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,593
show.

242
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,010
He ain't never stopped.
Got his own line of underwear.

243
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,630
I do whatever the fuck he wants.
He's an animal.

244
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,493
It would suck.
Keep going in those concerts though it 

245
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:19,270
and being like the back that can not be 
enjoyable hearing screens,

246
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,333
huge screens and the way they 
acoustically setup these things used to 

247
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:24,660
be a problem.
I'm like,

248
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,330
I told you that I used to work at great 
woods,

249
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,930
is kind of a funny story because,
uh,

250
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,390
it was during a bill cosby show that 
there was an issue there,

251
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,450
a bill cosby and um,
there was uh,

252
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:38,910
a Rodney dangerfield show the same 
issue.

253
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,710
And the issue was the way great woods is
set up,

254
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,843
it's an amphitheater,
so you're indoors and part of it and 

255
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,863
part of it is outdoors in the back of it
leads out to this like lawn area or at 

256
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:51,060
least did when I worked there.

257
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,250
And so you can hear if were under the 
canopy,

258
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,120
there was like an acoustic canopy above 
all the seats in the front.

259
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,103
But then the back there was no seats.
So it's like you had monsters behind 

260
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,030
you.
So he tried to watch a show.

261
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:07,530
Like there was one big fight,
I think I want to say it was,

262
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,160
it was Judas priest was a Judas priest.
No,

263
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:12,994
jethro tull.
It was jethro Tull was a jethro tull 

264
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,590
concert and there was a fucking mad riot
because people started lighting fires up

265
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,583
in the hood up in the grass area.
They were just lighting fires and there 

266
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,144
was not enough of us to sort of control 
it all because it was getting really 

267
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:31,270
fucking crazy.
So I put my security jacket,

268
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:33,820
I put a Hoodie on over my security 
jacket,

269
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,220
zipped it up through the Hoodie,
over my head and said,

270
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:38,260
fuck this job,
and I just quit.

271
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,153
I was like,
you can't pay me nine bucks an hour to 

272
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:43,540
get killed because this,
this is fucking madness.

273
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,520
I saw fistfights,
my friend Larry,

274
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:46,990
who was like one of the nicest guys in 
the world,

275
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,590
punch some guy and I was like,
Oh,

276
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,590
I'm fucking that.
If Larry's Hinton people.

277
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,740
Larry is like the sweetest of 
sweethearts and I'm like,

278
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,750
this guy's hitting people.
I am God.

279
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,420
This is a madness in the air.
I've got to get the fuck Outta here.

280
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,403
I got pistol for the jethro tull 
constitute because he breaks up the 

281
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:05,000
flute,
breaks up the flow.

282
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,080
Like,
what the fuck is this?

283
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,760
People from the east coast,
we don't like fluids,

284
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:09,594
stuff like we don't like flutes.
My point was in the backyard of the 

285
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:14,350
green,
the green grass area,

286
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,393
you couldn't hear the words.
You didn't understand what the fuck it 

287
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:18,400
was.
It was all echos.

288
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,161
It was all blah,
blah,

289
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:19,994
blah,
blah.

290
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,370
Like people were pissed.
They go,

291
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:24,040
I don't know what the fuck he's saying,
and Ronnie was killing too,

292
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,650
and so it was caused because he was 
killed.

293
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:26,484
We were just.
Jamie and I would talk on about a red 

294
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:33,421
rocks if you've been to red rocks,
you get so impressed with the sound like

295
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:34,654
cheat and I went like 80 something and 
then I went like a 90 something and it 

296
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:41,680
was like being indoors.
That's amazing.

297
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,660
Fiddler's green,
which is a little smaller.

298
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:46,870
I think on the other side of the Denver,
they had an issue there,

299
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:51,871
but now even the Hollywood bowl,
Jesus middle of people are there.

300
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,630
What's the popular?
Not too many.

301
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,530
That's insane.
Because you do stand up there.

302
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:01,840
Do you ever do they do it?
They do it.

303
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,570
Then suddenly got.
Roy was doing a set.

304
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,513
Yeah,
so I'm just doing like a movie night 

305
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:09,790
where we'd host and do some comedy.
Yeah.

306
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,550
Brody Brody didn't get paid for that 
one.

307
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,860
That was one of the brody didn't get 
paid for.

308
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,770
They fucked him at.

309
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,090
I think so.
Well we were re tweeting it.

310
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,953
Yeah.
He's like,

311
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,080
that's my money.
If I contact number three or whatever,

312
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,960
see what they did was crazy.
It was crazy.

313
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,973
He had a two shows.
One was in a small theater and one was 

314
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:34,750
in this big theater was doing the show 
in the smallest theater and they go,

315
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,130
would you like to do a show in the big 
theater?

316
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:36,701
So he goes,
yeah,

317
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,590
sure.
Thinking he's going to get paid.

318
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,270
They ask him,
do you want to work?

319
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,330
He put his name on the bill like you 
show.

320
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,790
He tweeted pictures of the lineup.
They had his name in the lineup.

321
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,500
It wasn't like a guest set or anything 
like that.

322
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,590
It was a guy they had scheduled on the 
show and nobody wants to go first.

323
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,960
You don't want to go up first in front 
of fucking 15,000

324
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:54,230
people.

325
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,030
You want to get the crowd warmed up 
first.

326
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,000
Brody had to go up there and do the 
hardest spot of the night.

327
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,063
Was second hardest spot of the night.
The hardest by the night is like 

328
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,200
following someone who crushes.
Like if you're going on after Diaz,

329
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,260
that's the hardest part of the night,
but any.

330
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,680
The second hardest part of the hardest 
part of the night is the first guy,

331
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,723
the first guy,
his first couple of minutes is kind of 

332
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:14,750
like a throwaway and you've got to kind 
of get everybody loose,

333
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,090
get everybody feeling good and then 
boom,

334
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:20,330
hit them in the material that has got to
have very few bumps in it because you're

335
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:23,130
trying to hypnotize these fuckers.
So like the early material,

336
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,330
it's gotta be like real smooth.
The more herky Jerky,

337
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:29,600
the earlier stuff is less likely to 
trust you.

338
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:30,434
You motherfucker,
you can't even get me into Goddamn 

339
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,380
Trans,
slipping off your words,

340
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,593
you know,
but if you go out there just smooth 

341
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:36,884
style and just walk right into it and 
really know what the fuck you're doing 

342
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:40,880
to get things started.

343
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,831
You know,
you,

344
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:42,700
you,
uh,

345
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,690
you forget about that.
I forgot about that.

346
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:47,610
I opened for Callan when he was doing 
his DVD and I owe.

347
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:49,550
It just opened.
It was the first time I had done that in

348
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,840
forever.
I was like,

349
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,860
Ooh,
this is interesting.

350
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,530
This is like a different.
You kinda gotta get everybody.

351
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,513
You feel it.
You feel like they're not quite there 

352
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:59,310
yet.
You gotta Kinda like massage and,

353
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,990
and then then you start the fucking 
crank it up and make them keep up,

354
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,180
you know.
But it's definitely a different thing.

355
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,400
Got slow them down,
suck them in.

356
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,130
And then the store,
we thought we'd show,

357
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,830
you know,
everybody talks about suicide.

358
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:16,910
I had a kid I grew up with Steve Mann,
cine and one day he just said,

359
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:18,770
fuck it.
He went to Cavo.

360
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,170
He walked with suicide bridge.
He this Sunday because glasses off,

361
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,900
we put him down.

362
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,200
He jumped and that was it.
Didn't leave a note.

363
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,540
Nothing.
He was always a little fucking crazy.

364
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,374
Every time you saw him he was quoting 
the albums and shit like it's starting 

365
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,000
to filing brain.
So you know,

366
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:37,250
he was disturbed somewhere along the 
line,

367
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,353
but nobody gave a fuck.
Like even today when I go home like a 

368
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:42,050
Web Mr.
Bench and fuck him,

369
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,880
he jumped.
He committed suicide.

370
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,400
Times have changed.
People give a fuck.

371
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,190
You kill yourself or it was just hurting
soul.

372
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,440
Twenty years ago you'd kill yourself.
Fuck that motherfucker.

373
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:53,330
He's in limbo.
Isn't that funny?

374
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:56,030
Because it was more like back then,
like a fucking,

375
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,060
you're an idiot.
Like back then,

376
00:16:59,061 --> 00:16:59,894
like you said,
you will have forgotten that they have 

377
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,810
no mass feeding.
Right.

378
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:03,644
When you watch yourself,
you can't get messed that you can't get 

379
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:09,230
messed up.
When you die,

380
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:10,940
they barrier.
You don't go to hell or heaven.

381
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,773
You got to like limbo.
You floating around with other people 

382
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:15,800
carrying the rope.
We never heard about like mental illness

383
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,700
when I heard about like completely crazy
people that were locked in an asylum.

384
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,990
But the idea of like your aunt taking 
pills because she's bipolar,

385
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:26,390
like what are you talking about?
We call them because it was accepted and

386
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,180
everyone knows like,
oh yeah,

387
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,030
we used to take volume and what's.
I think it's the opposite.

388
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,490
I think you just get used to people 
being fucking crazy.

389
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,170
You know?
You didn't feel like you had to medicate

390
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:36,801
them.
You know?

391
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:39,410
I think people were way more crazy in 
the sixties and seventies.

392
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,930
I'd do Johnny Reid.
I tried to kill himself,

393
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:44,210
but he jumped off a building.
Atlanta in the dumpster.

394
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,860
God,
how bad was he?

395
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,010
Broken?
Fucked up.

396
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,653
Fucked up and he throw punches.
Johnny Reid was a trip and he got a 

397
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:02,000
check from the government and he gave it
to you first.

398
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,623
That's what people thought,
but he lives like he banged his head on 

399
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,780
a dumpster on my fucking dog.
He lived and he gives his check from the

400
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:10,614
government and the first to the 
bartender and he torment the bartender 

401
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,110
to that check was done.
Then they throw them after the first and

402
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:18,300
they will last a little about the 18th 
and 19th.

403
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,770
When I was a kid,
I met Johnny Ray.

404
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,990
He through an east coast.
He locked the bathroom from the APP.

405
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,620
You liked the bathrooms and the outside 
of these coasts.

406
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,590
When you leave a bar at night,
when they close up,

407
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,280
they locked the bathroom.
Then they put like a lock box.

408
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,440
Have you break in?
They can't.

409
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,910
He would go into the bathroom.
Johnny [inaudible] like 11:00

410
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,440
in the morning that we lock them in 
there.

411
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,330
We leave them in there until like 6:00
at night.

412
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,140
We come back to have a drink.
He'd open the bathroom and he'd come out

413
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:49,210
like nothing.
I swear to God like nothing happened.

414
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,643
He was hilarious.
One day put my Dick on a chair next to 

415
00:18:53,771 --> 00:18:58,771
him sitting my friends,
see what happens,

416
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:01,710
and he's like,
wow.

417
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:06,330
And he just got up thought Johnny 
relived like maybe 12 years ago.

418
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:07,164
We used to give them bumps at coke and 
get them riled up at the bar and they 

419
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:11,200
just leave.
Fuck you motherfuckers.

420
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,230
I'll fight of this and he just fucking 
leave.

421
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,170
Hilarious.
Anyway,

422
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,533
Jew a Jew.
You ever have a great day to kill 

423
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,640
herself?
No sugar.

424
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,630
I put that fucking helmet granted 
permitted you fucking Dick.

425
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,380
You should kill yourself the first time 
and when you get to your destination,

426
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,250
killing yourself once you get up to 
heaven.

427
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,770
I'm not forgiving me.

428
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,840
Are All your ex girl still alive?
But there is.

429
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,790
Well,
I was going to bring it up.

430
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,790
It was like one girl that I knew.
She didn't kill herself.

431
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,920
Well she kinda did,
but it was with drugs,

432
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,740
but she wasn't ever a girlfriend.
She was a girl.

433
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:56,320
I knew when I was young.
Then I hung out with her again.

434
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,870
We were like adults,
but not much.

435
00:19:58,871 --> 00:19:59,350
You know,
we would,

436
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,850
we'd talk on the phone every now and 
again.

437
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,070
She was fucked up.
She was,

438
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:04,090
uh,
some,

439
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,760
some form of opiates and I don't know 
the whole story,

440
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,210
but uh,
she was sweet girl.

441
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,780
It was a real bummer.
Is there,

442
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,130
was really depressing when you hear 
about shit like that,

443
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:15,730
it's like,
Ooh,

444
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,563
that's so depressing.
It's so depressing when someone just 

445
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,630
can't keep a hold on it or just gets 
caught up in a spell and then their life

446
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:28,510
just slips away.
I know more than,

447
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,160
I mean more than I like a lot.

448
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,970
I know quite a few people have a real 
problem with those God damn pills.

449
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,060
Especially those pills.
They're so fucking available,

450
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:38,130
Joey.
They,

451
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:40,680
they'll stare so available that given 
you hurt your,

452
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:42,790
you got a boo boo.
You got a booboo here,

453
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,370
man.
Become a fucking angel.

454
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,040
Take this.
Go into Lala land.

455
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,790
Melt into your pillow and float away in 
a cloud of love.

456
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,430
Go ahead and old g going to have to get 
off that.

457
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:55,264
If you want your life and they give 
these people these pills and you tell 

458
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:58,691
them,
hey man,

459
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,240
you got a few weeks off of work,
you know you hurt your back,

460
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,393
had to get surgery and you'll start 
popping these fuckers watching TV and 

461
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:10,750
next thing you know,
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.

462
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,090
That's your life.
Your life is at.

463
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,133
I'm fucking sharp.
You know sharp has goddamn super 

464
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:16,600
athlete.

465
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,150
Brendan charms is big,
giant gorilla,

466
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,630
UFC fighter.
Pretty straight edge dude.

467
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,960
Pretty clean cut dude.
Four months in,

468
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,630
he's taking these fucking pills and his 
friends have to tell him like,

469
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:29,500
dude,
you got to stop.

470
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,210
His friends had to take his pills from 
them.

471
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,490
They fucking get you,
dude.

472
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,840
Yeah,
I know a girl that's going through it.

473
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:36,700
She buys a Vicodin and like,
like,

474
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,593
like,
uh,

475
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,340
I was talking to dealers.
Yeah,

476
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,370
she has.
She gets Viking in any downer.

477
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,400
And then,
uh,

478
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,060
it's weird because then she can't sleep 
at night.

479
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:46,894
So it's her all pilled up just talking 
like online and on periscope and you're 

480
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,630
just like,
what the fuck?

481
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,780
It's weird watching strangers on 
periscope also.

482
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,040
Just,
you know,

483
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:00,874
late night.
Hello for somebody tells himself on 

484
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,000
periscope.
I think it's already probably happened,

485
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:04,834
right?

486
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,751
No,
it's crazy.

487
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:08,060
I had a girlfriend in the eighth grade.
I really dug.

488
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,500
I met her.
She was a cheerleader.

489
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,450
Pretty cute.
This is fucked up.

490
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,180
And uh,
Irish chick,

491
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,103
just red hair.
I just dug know we'd hold hands and eat 

492
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:19,940
a slice of pizza after the basketball 
game with,

493
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,783
at the movies we may be swaps,
but one day we're talking about dry 

494
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:25,190
humping or whatever the fuck we're 
doing.

495
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:26,990
We went back to her house.
I never forget this.

496
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:31,500
I was dating like maybe two or three 
months just on the weekend.

497
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,360
And I'd walked down and you didn't city 
and when they asked,

498
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:36,800
I said,
what time your parents got on?

499
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,643
She goes,
something like that gets home at five 

500
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,790
and my mom is dead.
And I was like 12 or 13,

501
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,440
Joan.
My head almost exploded.

502
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:47,870
I was like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

503
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,410
She's like,
when my mom died at childbirth,

504
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,380
you know,
and I was like,

505
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,930
I couldn't even make out with her.
I felt I couldn't do anything.

506
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,570
I was just,
I just remember going home and going,

507
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:01,520
I can't see this girl.
Wow,

508
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,383
what the fuck,
how come you couldn't just thought and 

509
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,510
had never entered my mind.
So it was just too sad.

510
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,580
It was too.
It was mind boggling,

511
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:15,050
like not having a mom.
So I called her up one day and I stopped

512
00:23:15,051 --> 00:23:17,390
dating her and I started dating the 
southern Irish chicken.

513
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,580
I never thought about or again,
you know,

514
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:24,350
I know she was mad and then uh,
my mother died and I was like,

515
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:26,660
that's the first person I thought it was
this poor girl.

516
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,150
Like I knew what she fucking felt like.
No,

517
00:23:29,151 --> 00:23:29,984
I never,
I could never imagine that pain when I 

518
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:33,900
was dating him,
when she told me like,

519
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,620
what are you fucking talking about?
Your mom dies.

520
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,000
My fucking mom dies.
That's the worst thing I've had.

521
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:41,834
I think one of my girlfriends died,
one of the girls I dated earlier on 

522
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:45,980
about two years

523
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,570
ago.
I'm still friends with her brother.

524
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,150
We didn't really date.
We messed around a little bit.

525
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:54,070
She was fucking crazy and she ended up 
dying from pills and booze.

526
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,840
Nobody really know Joe.
We started off with guns.

527
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:57,674
No,
we went to 10 times before they asked 

528
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,540
me.
One of my girlfriends killed himself.

529
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,790
So it's,
you know,

530
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:08,180
it's weird when people that you really 
care about aren't there anymore.

531
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,430
It's a weird thing because they just 
vanish.

532
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:15,050
They just don't exist anymore.
And it's a sadness that is just so.

533
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,420
It's,
it's so forever,

534
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,620
you know.
I mean,

535
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,040
my friend Johnny is a,
who was my best friend for a long time.

536
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,050
It's a great guy.
Fucking loved that dude.

537
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,033
Couldn't wait to see him.
Every time I go to the east coast we'd 

538
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,034
hang out,
flew them up here and now when I flew 

539
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:34,760
them up here,
he was detoxing.

540
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,310
Same thing pills.
He was,

541
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,450
he's the oxys and he was into um,
he was in heroine,

542
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,800
like strong shit,
you know,

543
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:44,634
he liked strong opiates towards the end 
and it took a few days for him to get 

544
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:50,510
off of it and then then we can go around
and hang out.

545
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,623
Was just at my house,
just sweating for like four or five 

546
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:57,290
days.
And when he died,

547
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,310
man,
I remember thinking like,

548
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,610
I can't believe I'll never talk to that 
dude again.

549
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,960
I can't believe.
Like he was like,

550
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,280
there's one of the things about johnny 
is like,

551
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:16,090
he had this real clear view.
What the fuck is going on?

552
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,060
A key he was,
he had him.

553
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,130
His life might have been chaotic as far 
as drugs,

554
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,590
but he knew exactly what everybody was 
up to.

555
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,250
He knew he just knew he was a very smart
dude.

556
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,730
Very good at reading people.
And you could see like,

557
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,810
he's like looking around.
Shit.

558
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,213
When I met you,
that was the first thing that I noticed 

559
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,630
when I met,
when I met you.

560
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,990
It's like there's all these people that 
were scared of you who was so weird.

561
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,890
There was all these people that were 
like nervous around you.

562
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,230
You know,
they felt like joey did.

563
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,083
He's a bad guy.
Like this is like late nineties or 

564
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:50,290
whatever it was when we first met.
And I was like,

565
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,610
you're out of your fucking mind.

566
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,720
Like,
this guy's great,

567
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,213
you,
you seem to me to be a lot like him and 

568
00:25:57,671 --> 00:25:58,504
you,
the only to you and are the only two 

569
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:03,010
real original humans I've ever met or I 
can't.

570
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,060
I don't know anybody else like you and I
didn't know anybody else like him.

571
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,830
Just completely original characters.
There was one of the first things that I

572
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:15,050
really liked about you because we met 
like,

573
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,110
what was it,
like 95 or some shit.

574
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:17,944
Like what was it [inaudible] 97 after 
school that was still on Newsradio 

575
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:21,714
radio.
So it was only saw that when spent two 

576
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:27,991
years into news radio and I'm having 
those kinds of friends.

577
00:26:28,271 --> 00:26:29,980
Whose phone was that you were showing?
How dare you?

578
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,160
It's uh,
it's,

579
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,950
you know,
friends like that.

580
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,793
So important in your life,
friends who need people to clear you up 

581
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,973
from time to time.
That's why I call home every morning I 

582
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:44,220
got or five different guys

583
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,053
that whenever I talk to,
I talked to them and everything gets 

584
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,880
nice and smooth that,
you know,

585
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:50,803
every one of the other.
And right now it's really weird because 

586
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:56,940
now I have two friends that haven't 
spoken to in 20 years.

587
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:59,370
When I went on the,
on the land to Sarasota,

588
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,440
that kid hit me up on an email.
He goes,

589
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:03,990
I need to talk to you.
And Him and I,

590
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:05,430
when I went back to New Jersey,
he,

591
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,570
one of those kids,
he was in San Fran.

592
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,110
So you know what there is to do with 
Sarasota,

593
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:08,983
1982.
Not so when I went down and he was all 

594
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:12,870
excited.
He's got a partner,

595
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,340
you know the thing about him is he was 
shooting fucking becker and his biceps.

596
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,713
I mean seriously,
he was shooting them in his shoulder 

597
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:22,020
caps and his traps.
He was,

598
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,390
he was gone.
You know what I'm saying?

599
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,420
She was just a balloon and he was 
eating.

600
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,270
He was eating,
what's the German five milligram?

601
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,000
The shit that just puts,
not testosterone that decade.

602
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:35,970
The problem that he was eating at really
shit,

603
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,790
we're guaranteed the game.
Not but people.

604
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,460
Debo,
it's Diana and Diana.

605
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,350
This is 1982 people.
So if you want to look like a fucking.

606
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,390
So everything on him,
he was popping those Diana balls,

607
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,750
he was supposed to eat three a day.
He was eating like a,

608
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:55,584
the debt.
He was eating a double prescription 

609
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:02,390
bottle and then blast and off the 
fucking shit and is for.

610
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,440
I mean it was huge.
I love them though.

611
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:06,060
I got them.
So when I left,

612
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,190
he always got mad at me.
He called me man.

613
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:09,930
He hit me up on an email,
my website,

614
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,110
read all them back.
What's up dog?

615
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,420
It took me a couple of days when I'm 
like,

616
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,460
I don't want to hear this shit.

617
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,811
And he goes,
Hey man,

618
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:17,280
my dad died.
And he goes,

619
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,114
I got tell taste something.
I think about you every day because I 

620
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:24,570
can't imagine how you Ama shit at 16.
Then my other buddy,

621
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,693
his mom died about a month ago.
I sent flowers and he keeps calling me 

622
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:29,394
every morning going dog,
I don't know how to fuck you did it at 

623
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:31,723
16.
I got the most respect for you in the 

624
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:34,470
world.
It's like now I'm paying them back.

625
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,693
Wow.
For them taking care of me when I was 

626
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,340
younger,
it turned around.

627
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,390
I missed my dead bodies,
Bro.

628
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,760
I had misread that crazy dude.
The bodybuilder that was fucking,

629
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,640
uh,
you know,

630
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:50,260
we would take them to bars and we'd get 
on top of the fucking stage and Po's who

631
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,140
goes to a butler,
he didn't give a fuck.

632
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,930
And I take them to the UFC bar going up 
there.

633
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,133
But this is the guy that you told me 
that it was doing a line was mother's 

634
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,593
Danny beat different guy.
This is a line in front of his mother 

635
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:03,804
while I was on the phone or his mother 
shot steroids in his ass while he was 

636
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,543
doing.
He's talking about in the fall at the 

637
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:09,880
same time.
This is brilliant.

638
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,633
Tell me that wouldn't be like one of the
muscle area scenes and we've talked 

639
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:15,750
about it.
He comes to my shows.

640
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,990
Danny comes to my shows.
He still falls into the podcast.

641
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,410
That guy,
he just put a picture of him on twitter,

642
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,603
dressed in flux and full army Gallia 
with like fucking five generals behind 

643
00:29:28,171 --> 00:29:29,380
them.
Him Nineteen years old.

644
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:31,610
He was a soldier of the year in the 
army.

645
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,610
That's why he was doing this,
this,

646
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,740
and this at the same time,
because he could do that.

647
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,070
That's how crazy he was a soldier of the
year.

648
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,530
They would do an exercise

649
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,550
and fucking Beirut and four guys were in
a rap.

650
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,390
The rap tip over the saved all forming.
It made them the soldier,

651
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:50,860
the fucking.
He went to the White House.

652
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:51,694
Two years later they discharged him and 
he was selling blow on the fucking 

653
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:55,703
fucking crazy is that they dishonorably 
discharged them for running a gambling 

654
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:02,410
operation and the fucking North 
Carolina,

655
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:04,640
wherever they were stationed.
But this other.

656
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:05,810
Oh,
sorry.

657
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,900
Keep going.
I know this other kid that I showed you,

658
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:11,110
the crazy one that he won,
like Mr New Jersey.

659
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:11,944
Darrin.
I miss him every morning and he was the 

660
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,270
guy that died young from steroids.
Uh,

661
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:19,640
he died from everything.
He had everything.

662
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,670
He had hepatitis C.
Oh Jesus.

663
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,230
Sharon needles A.
Well,

664
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,613
he was already shooting in highschool by
wally button by something by March of 

665
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:33,030
82.
He was already coming to my house when I

666
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,560
talked to your doctor.
Talk to him,

667
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,743
man.

668
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,130
I think that's the first person who 
ever,

669
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,020
ever sat me down and he's like,
listen,

670
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,550
let me tell you what,
and he was coked out.

671
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:43,384
We were doing coke and it was like a 
secret inside his heart because I have 

672
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,260
to tell you something,
man.

673
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,900
He took off his shirt and he started 
doing pushups.

674
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,840
Like somebody just starts doing 50 push 
ups in front of like,

675
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:55,240
what the fuck's going on?
He got up and started flexing.

676
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,530
I'm like,
what are you doing?

677
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:57,843
And he goes,
I go to this person's house and they 

678
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:03,670
were gay and 82,
these two guys were gay,

679
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,930
but he grew up with them and he remained
friends with diamond.

680
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,080
He didn't care.
They were gay.

681
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,933
Nobody knew.
So they were Shannon and vitamin B 

682
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:13,260
shots.
Who is Sharon?

683
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:17,020
Oh,
deca no good ever comes out of.

684
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:19,050
We were sharing a needle,
but nobody,

685
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,253
nobody.

686
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,050
Nobody.
Nobody fucking knew.

687
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,480
That's like,
you know,

688
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,540
listen man,
when you're that level of a guy and that

689
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:29,374
type of gym situation,
think about you and I have never been 

690
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:33,760
that guy,
but they're guys that,

691
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:36,150
you know how people smoke a joint in 
rocky the other day.

692
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,510
I'm watching the beginning of rock.
He goes to the corner,

693
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:41,920
that's 18 guys sharing a wine bottle and
he takes the wine bottle,

694
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,110
takes a sip of it.
I'm thinking to myself,

695
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,880
that's fucking the flute,
but in those days and those days you had

696
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:51,610
to do that to be part of a guy.
You in a gym,

697
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,110
you all yoked up.
You have five foot 10 year 240 pounds.

698
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,120
Read best shoots.
Deca Redmond for me to flip you and just

699
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,260
take it from them and stick it in my 
game,

700
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:03,710
but I could see it.
Yeah,

701
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,970
I could see it.
That's the bond you on the street with.

702
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:09,600
These were living in skid row with 
thieves.

703
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,530
You were me.
Everything we take,

704
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,290
we split down the middle.
What you think's going to happen after a

705
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:15,124
year,
so we'll go fucking clint eastwood 

706
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:22,160
movies with the Indians.
They would cut their hands,

707
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,630
the hands put together.
My brothers,

708
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,793
I could see two guys shooting needle me 
and you were not in that world and red 

709
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:31,770
band were like,
oh,

710
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,850
you know,
but to some guy,

711
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,020
bullshit dude,
what's the guy that said let's do the in

712
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:39,950
person.
My favorite impersonation you'd do,

713
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,970
or the guy in Boston he gives you night,
night time with the jet.

714
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,010
Remember like I'm blessed in his se,
this guy,

715
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:46,844
you know,
oh,

716
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,960
Joe Lake,
my left,

717
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,970
my left.
This might night.

718
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,620
That dude in high school that was doing 
steroids.

719
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:55,963
He was enormous.
He was so much bigger than everybody 

720
00:32:57,501 --> 00:32:58,700
else.
It was crazy.

721
00:32:58,701 --> 00:33:00,980
He came from another school when we were
like,

722
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:01,814
I think I was a,
I guess I was a freshman and he was 

723
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:07,790
like,
he came in as a sophomore because like a

724
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:12,790
year older than me and he was with these
crazy stretchmarks.

725
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:16,850
We're talking about a 16 year old kids,
17 year old kid,

726
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:22,150
massive stretch marks all over his chest
with these watermelon,

727
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:24,380
tits.
He just had watermelon.

728
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:27,350
Tits are giant,
giant arms.

729
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:30,800
I mean literally the guy would walk his,
his arms like,

730
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:31,634
you know,
guys fake that this is a really how he 

731
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:33,920
stood.

732
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,630
He was massively muscular and he went to
a party one night in college.

733
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,840
There was these college kids at some 
college kid's mouth off to him.

734
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,080
He knocked out three college kids.
It was like a bowl.

735
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,270
He would just charge at people and 
punched up.

736
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,690
He was so juiced up.
He was always angry.

737
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,550
Like everywhere you,
if you like,

738
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,980
looked at him like you want it to be 
like real nice to them.

739
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:59,300
It was like being around a crazy,
like frothing at the mouth gorilla.

740
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,890
Then I saw him years and years later,
like not that many years.

741
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,773
Like I was like 21,
so he was probably like 22 and he 

742
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,620
weighed 160 pounds.
I was like,

743
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:11,180
what the fuck happened?
What happened?

744
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,143
I just got off the stuff.
He just got off of it and his body 

745
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:14,954
became like a normal size,
but you lose all your fluid or you lose 

746
00:34:17,151 --> 00:34:18,260
your muscle also.

747
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,510
But he was never.
He's a weird guy.

748
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:21,344
Like he didn't have big hands,
he wasn't like some earnie shavers dude 

749
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,450
or go or like a,
you know,

750
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,870
it's just a big like you are your big 
fucking thick guy.

751
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,790
He wasn't.
Yeah,

752
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,390
that's smaller hands.
It was just,

753
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,390
it was all steroids.
He just taken this thing and changed it.

754
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,080
Like the amount of muscle that his body 
would carry around.

755
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:41,330
It's just way more.
It was real weird.

756
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,660
I didn't know what the fuck he was doing
until after I was out of high school.

757
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,900
I had no idea what was going on.
I just thought he was just a big,

758
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:50,810
strong guy.
I wasn't in weight lifting.

759
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:53,660
I didn't play football and in taekwondo 
we,

760
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,040
we didn't do any weight lifting like,
no,

761
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,210
we did like some calisthenics,
but there was no weight lifting at all.

762
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,870
So I didn't no idea like what the fuck 
was going on with the student body.

763
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,943
But seeing him when I was 21 and seeing 
him like just like this deflate it 

764
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,770
person.
I was like,

765
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:11,720
this is the weirdest shit I've ever seen
in my life.

766
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,210
But back then,
no one knew what the fuck it was.

767
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,060
We're talking about like 1988.
It was when I was 21.

768
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,690
I didn't know what that meant.
I didn't understand how he got smaller,

769
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,733
like it didn't make any sense to me.
Like I didn't know anybody that was a 

770
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:25,910
bodybuilder or anything,
so it was just weird.

771
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,123
It was just weird to see them small.
And then as I got older and started 

772
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:32,600
talking to people,
especially when I was working at,

773
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:33,434
um,
that was working at Gold's gym or a 

774
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,010
nautilus plus,
that's,

775
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,160
it was nautilus plus

776
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,950
in revere.
And I knew this dude in there who was a,

777
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,010
he was a bodybuilder and he kind of 
schooled me on some of it.

778
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,400
I go because he was huge and I go,
do you take steroids?

779
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,383
And he goes,
dude,

780
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,850
fucking look at me.
And what do you think?

781
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,720
Of course I fucking take steroids.
He was the first guy I ever met that was

782
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:55,554
like super open about it.
He had these like he would wear like 

783
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:58,224
those daisy duke short back then 
bodybuilders or were those daisy duke 

784
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:01,584
shorts.
And this kid had these fucking giant 

785
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,760
tanned legs.
They were enormous Tangela.

786
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,470
He was fucking you.
I hope that look comes back.

787
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,520
Male daisy dukes.
It's not even coming back for girls.

788
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,443
So over.
Do you think there is certain clothes 

789
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:19,290
like that that will never come back?
Like bottoms bell bottoms?

790
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,850
I could see bell,
but they tried.

791
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,800
They tried,
but people realize it's stupid looking.

792
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,580
I rocked him.
Yeah.

793
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,423
You know what?
It worked back when people had long 

794
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:29,040
collars.
See that's the difference.

795
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,490
If you want to have those long collars 
that they had in the sixties,

796
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,600
you know,
like those,

797
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:38,100
those crazy jackets that you see like 
Jefferson starship in those.

798
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,340
And then you had platforms.
People were wearing platform shoes.

799
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,473
Remember those.
So like those all worked with the bell 

800
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:46,310
bottom.
Right?

801
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,840
But you get to like flip flops and bell 
bottoms,

802
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:52,140
flip flops and it gets annoying.
You're stepping on your bell bottoms.

803
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,760
That goofy,
that getting away.

804
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,260
He needs stilts.

805
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,080
You know what's really sad about juicing
that people that juice for a.

806
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,100
What do you call it?
Aesthetics.

807
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,240
Not because they're athletic.
Yes.

808
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:10,290
The further look,
it always ends up very bad because I was

809
00:37:10,571 --> 00:37:11,970
around them.
I grew up around it.

810
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,160
It becomes instead of snorting coke and 
drinking,

811
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,083
they go to steroids like that,
like the wrestler was on and there's 

812
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,590
warrants,
Wesley and he goes to cop.

813
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,720
Did you see when he caught.
I didn't see that movie.

814
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,580
Okay.
This apart.

815
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:28,000
When he comes to the gym,
he's copping fucking shit that they gave

816
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:30,470
Nazis,
like you know that guy,

817
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,340
the ball that and you could tell it's 
like $2,000

818
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:35,040
bucks.
And he goes,

819
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,160
what do you got right now?
And he goes,

820
00:37:36,161 --> 00:37:37,780
500,
because you're giving me a restaurant.

821
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,510
It was a bag.
If you know that world,

822
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,510
you know that for him,
that's a six week supply.

823
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,990
That's a year supply.
Then when he has his heart attack in the

824
00:37:46,991 --> 00:37:48,160
movie,
the doctor tells him,

825
00:37:48,161 --> 00:37:48,994
he goes,
Bro,

826
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,710
fuck you,
put in your body.

827
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,253
Are you fucking kidding me?
It's a slow death because it becomes an 

828
00:37:56,861 --> 00:37:58,090
addiction.
I saw it.

829
00:37:58,091 --> 00:38:03,091
I saw it go from once every six weeks to
four cycles a year to fuck.

830
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:06,010
I ain't getting off it,
but fuck it.

831
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:08,500
I'm going to have a super stack.
They call it stacking.

832
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,850
When the next thing you know you're 
taking fucking for things and you're not

833
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:13,684
competing.
You're just going to a bar on Friday 

834
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:18,640
nights.
I never got that in my head.

835
00:38:18,641 --> 00:38:22,360
I never got that and it always ends bad.
You see those guys a year later,

836
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:24,810
they have a heart attack.
They get deflated,

837
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,760
something happens and they go to prison 
and then they can do.

838
00:38:27,761 --> 00:38:28,594
When they come and you ask them what the
tattoos or fucked up now it's always 

839
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:33,640
ends bad.

840
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,013
Yeah.
I knew a guy who.

841
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,970
Yes,
it always and people,

842
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:37,804
you know,
I watched that documentary and eye 

843
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:40,204
contact.
We contact with each other by talking 

844
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,490
the Sterrad one that doesn't harm you 
and I believe you're stronger.

845
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:46,031
Faster.
Yeah,

846
00:38:46,031 --> 00:38:48,910
I believe that,
but I also believed that.

847
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:49,840
I saw,
you know,

848
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:51,790
you look at these guys down to the 
Jersey shore,

849
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,360
right?
You look at these guys in New Jersey,

850
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,370
still got that little bicep or then they
got time to go to the gym.

851
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,400
They do six curls.
They threw a fucking man of all that go.

852
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,273
Suntan.
They rubbed number fucking SPF number 

853
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:06,730
two and that's the result you get and 
they do sit ups.

854
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:11,110
That's exactly what they do and they do 
diamond pushups and they blogged for the

855
00:39:11,111 --> 00:39:11,944
summer and then they like it,
but I'm telling you I was part of that 

856
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:15,610
crew.
My friends.

857
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,990
I remember the chatter driving back from
the shore on Sundays out.

858
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,013
They couldn't wait to get home because 
it was the second respite until it was 

859
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,240
going to be the biggest thing.
I'm thinking of going home,

860
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,910
taking a shower and going out because 
I'm huge,

861
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,550
huge.
It's Sunday,

862
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:35,580
it's my second one.
The second day,

863
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,383
Sunday you're the biggest.
So these guys on the way home to my off 

864
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,040
day,
I'm going to get some pussy tonight.

865
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:47,370
My veins look at my bicep and just 
driving fucking hilarious.

866
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:55,180
It becomes something else.
I think it's like.

867
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,000
I think it's like alcohol,
like you could drink alcohol,

868
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:00,070
you could just have a capital,
a beer at night.

869
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,933
You could have a couple of glasses of 
wine with dinner or you can be that 

870
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:06,190
motherfucker that just gets hammered all
day,

871
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,170
every day,
and we all know that person.

872
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,300
We all have met a bunch of those people.

873
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:14,320
Some people just get addicted to shit 
day drinkers.

874
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,400
You,
Oh man,

875
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,293
there's a lot of those out there.
And especially in the entertainment 

876
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:19,144
business and then we can do whatever the
fuck you want and nobody can tell you 

877
00:40:21,821 --> 00:40:23,080
what to do.
Nobody tells you what to do.

878
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,970
That's why you're on periscope all day.
It's also people that I think that,

879
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,300
that did cocaine,
right?

880
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:28,900
That,
that,

881
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,330
that have an addiction to cocaine drink 
all day because they can,

882
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,170
even their filed supposedly some people 
that,

883
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:36,004
uh,
Duke,

884
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,330
you know,
I've never done it,

885
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:38,164
but the people that have done like,
a lot of it will tell you that they 

886
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,990
always want to have something to calm 
them down afterwards.

887
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,620
Take the edge off of it.
I didn't snow in the daytime.

888
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,940
I wasn't a fucking vampire.
I started at night.

889
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,120
It would fuck my whole day up if I even 
did the line sometimes.

890
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,880
See,
I wanted to have the coke ready at 8:00,

891
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,463
but sometimes I got a phone,
I'd have the 60 bucks early in the 

892
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,500
daytime and I'd shoot over a fucking 
slob.

893
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:06,130
I go over there and take the 60,
have to hide it in my jacket.

894
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:07,920
I have to sit there for four hours,
just coconut,

895
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,630
my jacket calling me and they have to 
know.

896
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,043
So I would do a little bump and then get
paranoid and jerk off and fuck up my 

897
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:15,574
timing at Nih.
That would fuck up my whole day so I 

898
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:19,540
wouldn't do it in the daytime.
I was always a nighttime guy,

899
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,850
so if you didn't cook during the day 
would fuck up your set.

900
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,710
Everything.
It fucked up everything.

901
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:25,180
The rest of my day,
my,

902
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,430
my timing because my,
my,

903
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,580
my soul wasn't intact with my central 
nervous system.

904
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,100
They were apart.
Now it's a part when you do blow and you

905
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:34,880
go on stage.

906
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,650
That's why I never understood that 
concept.

907
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,450
It always made me laugh when people go,
oh,

908
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:40,520
you funny,
because you do coke and go on stage.

909
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,020
Okay,
okay.

910
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,760
You fucking dummy.
I freeze up.

911
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,990
I freeze up,
I can't talk to people and I did blow.

912
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,680
That's why I went to my room and hit the
fucking turn the phone off.

913
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,750
You think I did that because I couldn't 
talk to people.

914
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,000
I don't know what the fuck you're 
talking about.

915
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,120
Isn't coke make you talk though?
It doesn't work.

916
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,280
That doesn't want to started when it 
started.

917
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:02,270
You're chatty.
Kathy.

918
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:04,190
You want to talk to everybody and shit 
yet.

919
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,263
But let me tell you something.
I started doing coke like in the 

920
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,693
eighties and I got on stage and 91 for 
the first time and in [inaudible] 92 I 

921
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:12,464
got on stage with the guys from dendrite
to the St Patty's show and right there 

922
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,360
was the first time I discovered cocaine 
in the stage at the boulder broker.

923
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,420
I did two bumps and tried to go onstage 
and be cute.

924
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,340
That shit didn't work.
I thought Richard Pryor,

925
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,430
Richard Pryor did coke and what I'm 
saying.

926
00:42:28,431 --> 00:42:30,350
So I tried it.
It didn't work.

927
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,220
That was put to anybody known to do coke
and go and stand.

928
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,540
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.

929
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,403
I think a lot of people do token and 
then Miami I would do the first two 

930
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:40,304
shows were sober,
but the third show it takes a book that 

931
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:45,344
coke in my pocket for enough is enough.
Enough is announced deal before the 

932
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:53,610
third show because I didn't know it work
because you'll have a tyra tyra,

933
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,320
but I didn't care.
They knew I was coked up.

934
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:58,563
Wow.
So they knew the people who were coked 

935
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:01,270
up new and they loved it.
Oh,

936
00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:02,001
look at him.
He's got an.

937
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:05,570
I thought it was cute too,
so I went back to my room and got fucked

938
00:43:05,571 --> 00:43:05,800
up.

939
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,760
But no it doesn't.
It never clicked to me.

940
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:14,090
Don't.
There's a motherfuck and go on state red

941
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,740
band.
You Miss Friday night.

942
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,813
I know.
I heard about this Friday night how I 

943
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,930
fucking almost had a nervous breakdown.
He was.

944
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,413
Remember when you and your wife were 
asking me questions and I was 

945
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,230
physically.
I was having a nervous breakdown.

946
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:28,064
Right,
because you think I'm fucking with you 

947
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:30,600
guys though.
I don't know.

948
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:34,340
Friday night.
I bombed so hard last week.

949
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,653
You know,
sometimes you get a transition pair and 

950
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:37,454
you've got all these bits that aren't 
ready and you bring them up and it's 

951
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:42,500
like you got three of them,
so you bomb for two weeks,

952
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,770
but all of a sudden one night they all 
come together.

953
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,480
Now you become a force.
Now it's a different game.

954
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:49,670
I was in that process for like two 
weeks.

955
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:51,710
I was in limbo.
I had good sets in Boston,

956
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,410
but anything I tried out of the ordinary
in Boston wasn't clicking for me,

957
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:56,244
so I just stuck to the original.
And then I came back to the comedy 

958
00:43:58,821 --> 00:43:59,654
store.
I ain't shit somewhere on Monday night 

959
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,930
and I went to the academy store,
Thursday opened up,

960
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:05,060
but then suicide joke that didn't take 
me very far.

961
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:08,483
And then the second time I told him the 
story about my friend who tried to 

962
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:12,374
commit suicide,
she failed and she wanted to the store 

963
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,470
and she bought a gram of coke from Chile
and as we were doing it I said,

964
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,210
you know,
how did you get out of the crazy house?

965
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,640
You try to kill you.
So three days ago,

966
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:25,220
and there was a big.
Graham was one big line.

967
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:27,470
She did the whole thing.
She looked at me and she goes,

968
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,910
I ain't crazy.
They let me out.

969
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,550
That was it.
I told that story of that one.

970
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,330
Got some last minute.
I in your rate and their main room and I

971
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:37,910
just died.
I had a file deleted.

972
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,620
I just died.
I just died a slow death.

973
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:42,930
I was trying new stuff.
I wasn't going nowhere.

974
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,690
I wanted to talk about trump and I just 
died.

975
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:48,360
So Friday I went to the store and I 
swear to God guys,

976
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:50,970
I didn't eat nothing.
All that smoke some pot I worked at.

977
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,450
I went to the y,
I did chest and the other thing,

978
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:59,451
I smoked dope before I left the house.
It was a little brown.

979
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,603
Seventy Milligram Brownie.
I had like maybe 13 cops left for the 

980
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:06,383
day.

981
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,420
I was fucking started this little.
He is right there.

982
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:12,370
It was a half a pack of an attic.
He edible.

983
00:45:12,371 --> 00:45:14,470
They give you two brownies each.
Each.

984
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:17,410
Each Brownie is 70 milligrams.
That's so crazy.

985
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,630
Scary.
I rub my balls.

986
00:45:19,631 --> 00:45:21,190
There's 70 milligrams,
you understand me?

987
00:45:21,191 --> 00:45:23,110
Seventy milligrams or uncle Joe.
He was like an that,

988
00:45:23,111 --> 00:45:23,944
but it's like an Aperitif,
so even supplies to the rest of the 

989
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:27,604
world.
Seventy milligrams of put you into a 

990
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:29,880
fucking hole.
You know,

991
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,920
I gave him a 500 last night.
He split split,

992
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,310
split,
split thousand milligram.

993
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,120
A book chain song down at all.
Oh my God.

994
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:48,730
Listen to me though.
We split it at 3:00

995
00:45:48,731 --> 00:45:50,690
in the afternoon.
Oh my God.

996
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,110
What are you trying to prove?
Like 7:00.

997
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,230
I was so flattered by 8:00.
And you know,

998
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:00,340
usually when you eat your that animal.
Fuck No,

999
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:05,720
this turned on me.
Annabelle turn savage.

1000
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,823
He beat me into submission.
At one point I had the cheese doodles 

1001
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:13,420
that belongs to the baby pirate's booty 
on the floor.

1002
00:46:13,421 --> 00:46:16,810
They were just coming out of my face.
I was just stuffing,

1003
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,700
stuffing pirate's booty and my face and 
a pair.

1004
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,190
There was a bunch of fruit and pirate's 
booty.

1005
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,593
I couldn't stop.
I kept beating the beaches and pirate's 

1006
00:46:27,821 --> 00:46:29,860
booty,
pirate's booty,

1007
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,950
cantaloupe and pirate's booty.
I must state the whole baby.

1008
00:46:32,951 --> 00:46:33,760
My wife was like,
well,

1009
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,920
because I had my turn to them so they 
couldn't see me.

1010
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,360
My wife's like,
what the fuck are you doing it in?

1011
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,410
Listen,
I got to go to bed.

1012
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,260
She goes to bed already.
I went to 45.

1013
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:48,550
I slept up for.
I got up.

1014
00:46:48,551 --> 00:46:50,980
I didn't know where I was.
Thirty minutes,

1015
00:46:50,981 --> 00:46:51,814
like Mad Max.
I just laid there four in the morning 

1016
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:01,210
and 30.
I woke up with a of energy energy.

1017
00:47:01,211 --> 00:47:04,360
I wanted to show.
I washed the car and went for breakfast.

1018
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,540
I want to wash the car.
My wife had to have a butler tar stains.

1019
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,873
Oh my God.
I was fucked up and I kept calling Lee 

1020
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,100
and certainly if the cubs Koi don't 
answer the phone,

1021
00:47:15,101 --> 00:47:15,934
he goes,
well I haven't camps on the court and I 

1022
00:47:16,391 --> 00:47:17,224
got on,
but.

1023
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:19,813
So again though,
you ate too much at the comedy last 

1024
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:23,891
night?
No,

1025
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:26,310
last night I didn't have anxiety guys.
Santi,

1026
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,490
70 milligrams a dick in my world.
Okay.

1027
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,950
I go down Laurel Canyon.
I right.

1028
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,030
I go to the corner store.
I pull up no drama.

1029
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,193
I get upstairs.
I don't even go upstairs because I know 

1030
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,530
the room was packed.
I can't go upstairs,

1031
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,670
so I'm alone at the comedy store.
I go into the original pack,

1032
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:48,760
I walk around a little bit like going to
the vip patio and I just sit there so to

1033
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:51,000
to listen to music.
Some black dude was smoking a joint.

1034
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,780
I mind my business.
I look straight ahead.

1035
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,900
I'm thinking about more material.
I'm going to say how I bombed.

1036
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,620
It's just whipping me now and I'm 
starting to get scared.

1037
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:04,621
I'm like,
Jeff comes over to me.

1038
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:05,441
He goes,
Joey,

1039
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:09,310
go onstage.
I walk over as I walk up the stairs.

1040
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:11,020
It's a soul.
That room,

1041
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:16,080
Megan Mooney,
Morgan Morgan Murphys up on fucking.

1042
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,660
She was and she was texting her right 
now and she was fucking killing right?

1043
00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:27,840
She's killing Megan.
Moved from whatever fucking lame is.

1044
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:29,610
Murphy brought the dog.
Um,

1045
00:48:29,611 --> 00:48:31,750
she was freaking me out and then she's 
killing on stage.

1046
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,680
I walk up to the first landing guys and 
it hits me.

1047
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,170
It's like,
oh my God,

1048
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:40,570
I'm getting anxiety attacks on 70 
milligrams.

1049
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,740
Not,
not.

1050
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:43,780
This can't be happening to me.
This ain't happening.

1051
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,720
And all of a sudden I'm standing there 
and it's getting worse.

1052
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:48,070
Guys,
it's getting worse now.

1053
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:50,020
There's one seat,
open up the whole comedy store,

1054
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,800
Mitsis Chair.
I sit in there for about a minute.

1055
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,950
She's got the blue light on,
the pressure's on.

1056
00:48:56,951 --> 00:49:00,910
I got water in my hand.
I get back up and it's getting worse.

1057
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:02,110
Guys.
I turned around,

1058
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:02,944
I looked down to where the payphone used
to be and now I'm getting the anxiety I 

1059
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,130
get when I'm getting the needle,
which means I'm going down.

1060
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,700
So I got to look for day light for air.
I know this,

1061
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:18,400
I'll look for air,
but I know if I go down those stairs,

1062
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:20,560
if she calls my name and I come back up 
those stairs,

1063
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:24,700
I'm really gonna have an anxiety attack.
So I go to the corner and I just started

1064
00:49:24,701 --> 00:49:25,534
looking at the wall and I start 
breathing through my nose and some guy 

1065
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:28,000
comes up,
he's like,

1066
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,410
Hey Joey,
how are you doing man?

1067
00:49:29,411 --> 00:49:30,161
What's going on?
I go,

1068
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:32,960
nothing like keep looking at the wall.
And then he gets to hit the walkaway.

1069
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,990
Then some other guy pops out and he's 
like,

1070
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:37,180
Hey Joey,
I'm friends with such and such.

1071
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:38,710
He goes,
do you know where he is?

1072
00:49:38,711 --> 00:49:40,900
I don't give a fuck.
What did you see me staring at a fucking

1073
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:45,280
walk.
The Jeff comes up to me and I go,

1074
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:46,630
Jeff,
hold on one second,

1075
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:46,870
Jen.

1076
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,230
I'm going to faint.
I got a really bad anxiety attack.

1077
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:52,600
I'm going down here.
Tell Pauli to go on stage,

1078
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:55,570
and Jeff also wants to ask me questions.
He's like,

1079
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,650
dude,
do you know if Paul,

1080
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,630
he's going to go up on stage.
I don't give a fuck.

1081
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,660
He's the closest person we put in stage.
She's about to call my name and all of a

1082
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:04,931
sudden he goes,
well,

1083
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:07,400
let me go ask.
I'm gonna fucking go ask him a fuck.

1084
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,580
I'm about to fucking faint and now 
you're going to do this to me.

1085
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,580
So he walks over to Paul and he starts 
asking Paul and Paul,

1086
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:13,414
he's like,
and now they're getting into like a 

1087
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:16,380
conversation about it.
Instead of Poli going,

1088
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,100
he's got an anxiety attack.
Let me go up there.

1089
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,440
I'm watching this go down.
I get so angered.

1090
00:50:20,441 --> 00:50:21,280
I go,
fuck it guys.

1091
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,760
I'm like,
who the fuck knows what he said?

1092
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,090
Instead of going just red

1093
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,933
bank,
go up,

1094
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,430
go up red band.
I got anxiety.

1095
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:32,060
You Go,
okay,

1096
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,590
Joey,
and I'm worried about you letting you.

1097
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:34,424
Okay.
Yeah.

1098
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,300
Was Go,
no,

1099
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,880
these guys are having a conversation.
Bureaucracy.

1100
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,100
I got so fucking angry.
Then I go,

1101
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:41,420
fuck you guys.
I'm going to go up.

1102
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:45,560
And I went up there,
Joe Rogan to set up my life off of fear.

1103
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,170
I think I caught myself at the 14 
minutes.

1104
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:50,900
I was like,
Oh man,

1105
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:52,790
I just yell.
Did you record it?

1106
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,500
No.
Why would I do something like that?

1107
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:55,334
You have a fucking retard.
I fucking went up there and just draw 

1108
00:50:58,471 --> 00:50:59,091
and no,
you know,

1109
00:50:59,091 --> 00:51:03,950
you never hear me talking like this.
It was all unfair and I remember walking

1110
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:04,610
out of there,
man,

1111
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:06,260
I got in that car and Paul,
he goes,

1112
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,153
man,
you shouldn't have anxiety attacks more 

1113
00:51:08,091 --> 00:51:09,220
often than shit.
And I was like,

1114
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,840
man,
I was fucking dying.

1115
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:12,893
I like how you have Mitsis voice when 
you do the impression of the same voice 

1116
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:22,460
you do any.
Do Mitzi?

1117
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:23,740
Like all this shit?
Sure.

1118
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,200
Share one.
Joey Diaz,

1119
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,043
voice Joe.
Have you ever had that where you were 

1120
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,413
like either to stoners so you just 
didn't feel good and you're about to go 

1121
00:51:30,851 --> 00:51:31,684
on stage and you almost couldn't.
You almost don't think you could have 

1122
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,830
done it?
No,

1123
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,570
I know what you're saying.
No,

1124
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:38,860
I've never gotten it,
but I don't.

1125
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,240
I don't.
I won't take that kind of,

1126
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,173
but before I go on stage,
I've fucked up and gotten too high 

1127
00:51:43,121 --> 00:51:46,180
before I went onstage,
but never so high where I'm like,

1128
00:51:46,181 --> 00:51:48,160
I can't do this.
I can't do that.

1129
00:51:48,161 --> 00:51:49,950
I'm having an anxiety attack.
No,

1130
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,440
but I've been hired and that hasn't 
happened to me.

1131
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:57,490
Sometimes it just catches you in time,
especially if you have a rough set.

1132
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:58,683
If you had a rough set the night before,
if you're working on some new stuff and 

1133
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:02,260
it doesn't go over right,
you can't recover.

1134
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,280
I mean,
we've all been there.

1135
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,263
If you haven't been there,
it's just because you haven't taken 

1136
00:52:05,351 --> 00:52:09,940
enough chances.
I've been there all the time.

1137
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,110
It's like those moments after that are 
shaky,

1138
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,450
like you know,
it's a shaky one or two days,

1139
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,610
you know,
sometimes sometimes it's not.

1140
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,893
Sometimes it makes sense and there's a 
reason you could just get right back 

1141
00:52:21,581 --> 00:52:22,414
into it,
but sometimes there's like a little 

1142
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:24,910
shaky period.
So the shaky period,

1143
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,100
that's 70 milligrams was enough to whack
you.

1144
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,990
You did to seventies once.
The other 70 was from a couple of nights

1145
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:37,260
just for the general public 70.
We'll fucking send you down a tornado of

1146
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,310
despair to the bottom Pitsa your soul 
just to,

1147
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,470
just to know,
don't try to do what he's doing.

1148
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:45,723
Like I won't.
I don't fuck around man with anything 

1149
00:52:47,261 --> 00:52:49,250
more than like 30.
Do you think that that,

1150
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:51,250
that even matters what it is though?

1151
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,083
Really?
I do think it's that accurate where 70 

1152
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:59,041
is even ballpark 70 or maybe he just got
something that had 600 in because it was

1153
00:52:59,891 --> 00:53:02,050
like the bottom of the barrel.
Well you certainly can,

1154
00:53:02,051 --> 00:53:02,884
you know that bit.
I do a bit about the guys who make that 

1155
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:05,200
stuff.
Yeah.

1156
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,080
It hasn't gotten any better.
Like Colorado,

1157
00:53:08,081 --> 00:53:10,450
they have it down to a science,
they're doing an in Colorado,

1158
00:53:10,451 --> 00:53:14,710
the way they would make regular cookies,
like if you buy like some,

1159
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:15,623
you know,
like Nabisco chips a whole or some shit 

1160
00:53:17,441 --> 00:53:19,000
like that.
They do them like a factory.

1161
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:20,043
There's not much difference between the 
way they're making some of these 

1162
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:22,144
cookies.
They have these big machines and they 

1163
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:26,220
have all these people working there.
It's

1164
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,310
pretty fucking down to a science.
They're not just throw,

1165
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:33,180
throwing their own ingredients in home,
cooking,

1166
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:35,730
all this stuff.
They're making a lot of money.

1167
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:39,030
They had this like I'm one of those news
report shows.

1168
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,250
Forget which one was it?
Sixty minutes.

1169
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:45,030
They went to Denver and they 
participated.

1170
00:53:45,031 --> 00:53:45,864
They got high,
they got high and fucking Limo with 

1171
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:48,510
these people and they,
uh,

1172
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:51,630
they went around to all these different 
places and watch these people make these

1173
00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:53,210
things,
that plate.

1174
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:58,330
There's a revolution going on in Denver.
Like it's so off the charts there,

1175
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,773
it's so crazy there.
They'll like you watching this thing on 

1176
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:04,950
television.
It just starts to sink in.

1177
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:08,700
Like they're changing the whole culture 
around that town.

1178
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,790
Like the whole culture is going to 
slowly chill out.

1179
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,910
They're violent.
Crime rate is so low now.

1180
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:15,953
They're fucking drunk.
Driving rates are the lowest they've 

1181
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:18,624
ever had.

1182
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:21,150
It's nuts.
It's changing everything.

1183
00:54:21,151 --> 00:54:21,984
And it's only been a year to like how 
many years has it been since it's been 

1184
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:26,350
legal?
What's the official?

1185
00:54:26,351 --> 00:54:28,530
It'll be two years.
Is it going to Jamie?

1186
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,340
If I find out when,
when the,

1187
00:54:30,341 --> 00:54:31,800
uh,
the law went through,

1188
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,990
but in Oregon they're going to have 
lead.

1189
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,223
We tax free.
Oregon's taking it to a totally new 

1190
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:39,960
level,
but Washington just a,

1191
00:54:39,961 --> 00:54:40,794
I just saw a red or a part that 
Washington it had like I think 

1192
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:46,020
$70,000,000
their first year of tax revenue.

1193
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,330
So that seems like a lot of money just 
to,

1194
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,970
that's a lot throw away.
But I agree with you.

1195
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,540
I think the,
the taxes that the,

1196
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:54,374
uh,
the Colorado and poses which are really 

1197
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:57,570
high,
I think those are great.

1198
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,050
Yeah,
I agree.

1199
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:01,230
Because it's still better than going 
drinking if you go drinking.

1200
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,880
Okay.
If we have a few drinks,

1201
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:03,863
like if I go and get us around and all 
four of us went out drinking and I look 

1202
00:55:06,911 --> 00:55:11,070
at this kids shots and a beer and that's
like 100 bucks right all together.

1203
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,240
Then you got to tip the guy that like 
200 bucks for the weed.

1204
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,720
Jesus Christ,
we the four of us with 200 bucks,

1205
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:19,554
whether we'd,
we'd be fucked for a month and we could 

1206
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,380
take home.
So yeah,

1207
00:55:22,381 --> 00:55:24,750
$200.
That's a lot of weed.

1208
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,780
Especially if you're buying edibles.
Oh my God.

1209
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:32,400
You could almost die on $200 worth of 
weed edibles.

1210
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:34,770
I mean if you ate them all.
What's happening last year?

1211
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:35,663
Beginning of last year.
So they 2012 voted at the end of 2012 

1212
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:42,160
and started at the beginning of 2014.
Well,

1213
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,550
oh I see,
I see.

1214
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,660
So there's a,
there's a delay.

1215
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:46,523
That is one of the,
I gotta be honest with you that as one 

1216
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:51,520
of the funnest four days you'll have as 
a comic is,

1217
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:53,343
oh Denver is.
Especially if you stayed down because 

1218
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:58,350
you eat at Sam's that motherfucking 
Green Chili for breakfast with those two

1219
00:55:58,351 --> 00:56:00,390
weeks or some wheat toast.
A bowl of fruit.

1220
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:04,020
God.
Oh my God.

1221
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,450
What're you going to talk about?
The crowds?

1222
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,900
No,
you got the weed store.

1223
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,770
Then you've got the comedy world.
I mean it's like a three.

1224
00:56:10,771 --> 00:56:12,300
It's like you can't lose for three days 
ago.

1225
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,153
The gym you cannot lose.
It's a triple fuckin head of the with 

1226
00:56:15,661 --> 00:56:16,920
little weed store.
They got the.

1227
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,970
They go out on the recreational side.
They have some strong stuff.

1228
00:56:20,971 --> 00:56:24,040
But yeah,
that's a great

1229
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,330
spot.
It's a great little weeds.

1230
00:56:25,331 --> 00:56:26,164
One of my favorite places.
One of the few places I would live 

1231
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,260
besides here.
I'll tell you what,

1232
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:31,480
you made me laugh because I thought 
about something,

1233
00:56:31,481 --> 00:56:31,900
right?
Band,

1234
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,510
you know what pill when I was growing 
up,

1235
00:56:34,511 --> 00:56:37,330
had a lot of mistakes with them.
What pill?

1236
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:41,620
Like if they made 100 of them,
10 of them would always be quite loose.

1237
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:42,810
Really kind of,
um,

1238
00:56:42,811 --> 00:56:45,790
we're always done what they done because
it was corruption.

1239
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,653
No,
it would dodge because the guy who was 

1240
00:56:48,611 --> 00:56:51,070
making him his,
his flaw was lopsided.

1241
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:53,520
You know what I'm saying?
You put them in the oven.

1242
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,410
Who the fuck knows Joe Rogan?
I don't fucking know.

1243
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:01,860
He was lopsided right now.
This table chemicals go down to the bike

1244
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,900
for every hundred.
The most ridiculous idea.

1245
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:12,243
Pills ever.
Let's just say the power goes to this 

1246
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:17,724
side,
so you need 10 biscuits and nothing 

1247
00:57:19,631 --> 00:57:21,400
would happen and people would go,
oh my God,

1248
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:23,920
I got a dud.
That means the next one's gonna be good.

1249
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:28,090
That was a philosophy around the.
But that's a different philosophy to it.

1250
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,060
What if cosby gave one of those guides 
to one of his freaks?

1251
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:31,923
Just see.
Yes.

1252
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,453
Yeah,
and it was a big black dick waiting on 

1253
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:41,770
them pills to heather and shit and 
that's a great bit.

1254
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:42,850
That's it.
Do you

1255
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:46,880
think that he could get laid?
He could have probably almost any of the

1256
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:49,280
girls he wanted to drug anyways.
Probably.

1257
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:52,140
Why do you think he did that?
It's positive.

1258
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,670
It's part of is free.
I mean we could speculate all day long,

1259
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:58,420
but obviously he's sick,
right?

1260
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,700
Obviously,
but we kind of knew that anyway,

1261
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,030
it's not the new sick to the extent that
he is,

1262
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:09,340
but he's got this like creepy arrogance 
about him and uh,

1263
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,330
you know,
we played that clip once,

1264
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:16,760
or Wanda Sykes who was like the sweetest
person in the world was interviewing him

1265
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,940
and,
and the way she was talking to him,

1266
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:23,240
I guess he didn't like it.
So he corrected her.

1267
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,600
He corrected her,
you know her,

1268
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:29,000
her use of ebonics or what have you,
Rod Mcqueen,

1269
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:32,000
kind of just not a nice guy,
just not a nice guy.

1270
00:58:32,001 --> 00:58:33,230
And he was wearing sunglasses.

1271
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,280
Like he's just,
you know,

1272
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,260
when you're indoors you're wearing 
sunglasses,

1273
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,780
like unless you've got glaucoma,
what the fuck you doing?

1274
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,240
Like what are you doing?
Why do you have sunglasses on?

1275
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:45,870
Unless you're black,
you get away with floyd mayweather,

1276
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,620
you with sunglasses or whatever the fuck
he wants as far as I'm concerned.

1277
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,870
He can wear sunglasses anywhere he 
wants,

1278
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,020
but you know,
it's like those.

1279
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,550
Anyone who does that,
like,

1280
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,473
you know what I mean?
It's just weird because I could see 

1281
00:58:57,381 --> 00:59:00,200
where it looked like a normal person 
would drug it to cut,

1282
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:01,940
just to get laid.
It just seems like,

1283
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,390
you know,
he built fucking cosby creep.

1284
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:09,080
Did he like the girl just being passed 
out like it's dry.

1285
00:59:09,081 --> 00:59:10,820
He likes dry sex or something.
He might.

1286
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:11,683
He might like to be the God.
He might like to be totally in control 

1287
00:59:15,021 --> 00:59:15,560
of their life.

1288
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,393
It might like the idea that,
that he tricked them and they now they 

1289
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:23,240
to do his bidding while they're 
completely unconscious.

1290
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:24,074
I don't know how unconscious they are.
Maybe they're in like a halfway dream 

1291
00:59:26,161 --> 00:59:28,130
land where he could talk to them and 
doing stuff,

1292
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,173
you know,
like lift your legs up and they'll just 

1293
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:32,240
do it and they just don't remember it.
It might just be so fucked.

1294
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,020
I don't understand.
I talked to you gentlemen,

1295
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,020
this four of us in this room.
We're all men here.

1296
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,930
I may use,
have had an experience.

1297
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,793
I mean maybe fucking red bed homies,
event experience where you brought a 

1298
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:44,084
woman to your room and nothing happened.
Looked me in the eye and tell me the 

1299
00:59:46,191 --> 00:59:46,910
truth.
Gentleman,

1300
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,780
it happened.
Okay,

1301
00:59:47,781 --> 00:59:51,170
so if that's what,
let's just with four gentlemen here,

1302
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:54,170
I'll just be on the show.
We're at 80 percent.

1303
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:58,550
If you bring a woman to your hotel room,
eight out of 10 times,

1304
00:59:58,551 --> 01:00:01,010
you're going to fuck her.
Guys told me the truth.

1305
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,280
We just guys,
it depends.

1306
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,093
Probably read bad.
You're a nice guy to bring them over to 

1307
01:00:08,601 --> 01:00:10,540
get high and they get naked feeding,
but those,

1308
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,190
those netplus talking about,
you know,

1309
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,680
you're a nice guy.
I have some time.

1310
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,690
You know what happens entirely on the 
individual.

1311
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:19,770
The intent when you're a guy like bill 
cosby,

1312
01:00:19,771 --> 01:00:21,190
he's a superstar,
multi,

1313
01:00:21,191 --> 01:00:22,024
multimillion dollar women.
They've got to go to his room without 

1314
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:24,890
sucking his dick.
Let's be honest.

1315
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,750
Not a whole lot of them.
All of them.

1316
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:29,623
I've got to go into that room.
Whether that married or that half of 

1317
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:34,070
those bitches got a different story 
also.

1318
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,253
Okay.
He drugged you because you were alone 

1319
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:38,990
with him in a fucking room.
He had plans.

1320
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,160
I'm not blaming them,
but when joe were men here were met.

1321
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:46,580
You know when you go into a hotel room 
or his trailer,

1322
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:52,010
you know what the fuck,
so he had to put a pill into your thing.

1323
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:55,670
He's a dirty mother Fucker,
let's get that out of the way because he

1324
01:00:55,671 --> 01:00:56,504
enjoys that faint woman,
that woman that's half dead and that's 

1325
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:02,270
what he his.
That's his freak.

1326
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,283
Some people still bodies from cemetery.
Some people want to get jerked off with 

1327
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:08,060
their feet.
That was his.

1328
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,673
I had a friend who was after a while I 
was doing and he said they were jerking 

1329
01:01:12,651 --> 01:01:14,230
off his feet because he was scared of 
the hip,

1330
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,520
so he just happened to jerk him off of 
his feet.

1331
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:18,350
Their feet with their feet.
Yeah,

1332
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,480
I wouldn't do that either.
That's just as worse.

1333
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,123
Hooker feet.
So we'll hook a dirty concrete and 

1334
01:01:23,871 --> 01:01:25,430
sperm.
That shit don't mix,

1335
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,900
but let's face it,
he,

1336
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:31,010
he took those women to his room and he 
has a real interesting take on this.

1337
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:33,860
He had a real good taking this and there
was another guy that got charged for.

1338
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:36,860
It was like cee Lo Green guy was giving 
girls ecstasy or something like that.

1339
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:37,783
Yes.
Grandma's getting molly and Eddie was 

1340
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,544
talking about like what it must be like 
to be like a really famous guy who's 

1341
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,353
really rich but you're also like maybe 
not the most attractive guy in the 

1342
01:01:47,661 --> 01:01:48,590
world,
you know,

1343
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,810
so like maybe some of them they want to 
get to know you,

1344
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,990
but then when you want them to like be 
sexually attracted to you,

1345
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,123
it doesn't happen.
And so if you're a creep you start 

1346
01:01:58,371 --> 01:02:01,520
drugging them and that's what Eddie was 
proposing.

1347
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:02,383
Who's saying like maybe like he just got
tired of them saying no and he thought 

1348
01:02:05,691 --> 01:02:07,700
he was better than them and just dropped
it in.

1349
01:02:07,701 --> 01:02:11,540
I forget exactly the words but I hadn't 
considered it like that.

1350
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,373
I hadn't thought about it like that.
Like maybe maybe they're not all saying 

1351
01:02:15,261 --> 01:02:16,094
yes.
I mean maybe it is a weird thing with 

1352
01:02:17,781 --> 01:02:18,614
them where it got really frustrating and
then he just decided to do it or is it 

1353
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:25,410
possible?
That may be.

1354
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:26,244
This was like a much more prevalent and 
accepted thing in the circles that he 

1355
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:31,554
was running in the 19 sixties.
Is it possible that people like you 

1356
01:02:34,811 --> 01:02:35,644
would talk about people giving people a 
Mickey or he did a joke about Spanish 

1357
01:02:39,331 --> 01:02:40,164
fly that Spanish fly Joe,
is it possible that more people were 

1358
01:02:43,111 --> 01:02:45,390
doing this back then and we're just 
finding out about it now?

1359
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:50,130
I don't know because I mean they 
slipping the Mickey thing was totally.

1360
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,173
I mean,
and the Spanish fly thing was almost 

1361
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:57,030
common like people talked about like on 
the tonight show.

1362
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,770
I think bill cosby talked about it like,
you know,

1363
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:04,280
and it seemed like it was more accepted,
but I was,

1364
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:09,000
it they weren't aware was it like,
but I don't know anybody who got like in

1365
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:11,820
the sixties or seventies who got a 
mickey slipped into them.

1366
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,070
It's like,
why was that such a common expression?

1367
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,780
Charles Bronson never did it.
James Colbert never did it.

1368
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:22,560
Steve Mcqueen never did it.
Fucking burt reynolds never did it.

1369
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:23,640
Can you,
uh,

1370
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,280
do me a favor.
I wanted to show Joe Rogan.

1371
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,620
Can you get me the beginning of the 
longest show?

1372
01:03:28,621 --> 01:03:31,170
And I want to show Joe Rogan how much 
times have changed.

1373
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:33,000
You know what it is?
It's really dark.

1374
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,313
There's something really dark about it,
like you can imagine like what is just 

1375
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,700
what is,
what's,

1376
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,740
what's going on,
what is his essence?

1377
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:42,240
You know,
what is his soul?

1378
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:47,400
He's doing that.
Was there a movie that made it look sexy

1379
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,020
back in that day?
Like a James Bond,

1380
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:49,410
like,
oh,

1381
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:53,260
I got some Spanish fly that seems like.
I remember there was,

1382
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:55,080
you know what,
there was a movie though,

1383
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:55,973
animal house where he had to decide 
whether or not to do the right thing or 

1384
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:00,300
the wrong thing.

1385
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:05,490
Remember the black on the show has the 
angel was saying,

1386
01:04:05,491 --> 01:04:05,940
Hey,
you know,

1387
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,630
she's blacked out devils.
Like fuck her,

1388
01:04:07,631 --> 01:04:09,860
suck her tits fucker.
And,

1389
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,670
and you know,
he couldn't figure out what to do.

1390
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:13,710
Like you could,
you probably couldn't even do that movie

1391
01:04:13,711 --> 01:04:18,480
today,
but as a joke,

1392
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:20,340
you can't mean.
It's one thing if this was.

1393
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:24,570
You can obviously have a horrific rape 
scene if it's like a drama,

1394
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:25,483
right?
But if it's a comedy and you're joking 

1395
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:29,580
around about right,
you can't have that.

1396
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:30,863
No one will accept that.
The last rape scene that made you 

1397
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:33,703
uncomfortable for use with movies,
just always rape scenes that make you 

1398
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:39,630
uncomfortable,
but what I'm saying is that you couldn't

1399
01:04:39,631 --> 01:04:42,400
have a joke about potentially raping 
girl,

1400
01:04:42,401 --> 01:04:44,370
like Animal House,
like you could have.

1401
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,610
You could have a horrible scene in a 
realistic show,

1402
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:50,610
but we're the devils on your shoulder 
and a gone fuck her.

1403
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:51,630
Fuck her.
Like,

1404
01:04:51,631 --> 01:04:53,920
whoa.
Like that's A.

1405
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,340
I don't think you could do that today.
We'll watch this for a second.

1406
01:04:56,341 --> 01:04:58,200
Jamie,
did you find it's in the.

1407
01:04:58,201 --> 01:05:01,020
It's in the opening scene from the 
original longest.

1408
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:03,180
It's watch this.
You're going to die.

1409
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:06,900
You're going to say they could not do 
this in the fucking movie at the time.

1410
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:08,430
Yeah.
Let us get.

1411
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:12,590
This is the original log.
Original longest yard firsthand and long

1412
01:05:12,591 --> 01:05:17,591
as you are is so fucking off color,
but it could not be done today.

1413
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,073
I will.
We just watched it by mistake one day 

1414
01:05:20,301 --> 01:05:23,050
and we're like,
oh my God.

1415
01:05:23,051 --> 01:05:24,640
That's fucking bad.
Really.

1416
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,820
I never listen.
I ran in those circles.

1417
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,000
I'm gonna.
Look you guys in the face.

1418
01:05:28,001 --> 01:05:33,001
I never heard of people spike and girls.
That would not be acceptable.

1419
01:05:33,271 --> 01:05:36,520
I came from.
That would not be acceptable.

1420
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:37,503
Don't get me wrong.
I've gotten checked coked up to the 

1421
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:40,700
gills to suck my Dick.
Right.

1422
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,070
But they're awaiting that.
Margaret and I had the tension.

1423
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:47,380
You know what I'm saying?
I felt bad the next day,

1424
01:05:47,381 --> 01:05:49,300
but they did the blow.
You do the devil.

1425
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,230
You got to drink the side of.
You know what I'm saying?

1426
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:58,900
This is.
This is just crank it.

1427
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:04,133
Yes.

1428
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:12,980
Bastard.

1429
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,250
This is terrible.
I watched this dog.

1430
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:30,050
I told you not to touch my goddamn car.
You can't do that today.

1431
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,250
This terrible.
Dude.

1432
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:38,790
This is so bad.
This is 1973.

1433
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:44,070
I can't believe how bad it is.
Tricky in the garden.

1434
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:49,090
That's what people did back then.
Are you fucking kidding me?

1435
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:52,720
Are you fucking kidding me?
Chewing gum.

1436
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:55,870
Smile in chewing gum up.
Drinking.

1437
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,190
What kind of shit boxes he driving 
though?

1438
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,170
That's it.
Alrighty.

1439
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:04,070
In 1973.
That's what a Maserati lights.

1440
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:08,770
You just said don't touch my.
Isn't that funny?

1441
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:09,813
That that could be like a cool car and 
the cops are now coming after him while 

1442
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:17,880
he's drinking.
It throws in the backseat.

1443
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,353
This is Berlin and the god of his life.
He's out running the cops with his 

1444
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:28,690
Maserati here.
This is hilarious.

1445
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:33,430
They're in a go kart race.
A car is such a shit box.

1446
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:38,590
Look at it that had that car.
That's your dad had that?

1447
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,790
I think so.
I think he had an old one.

1448
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:45,270
Giant,
big goofy American cars chasing it.

1449
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,250
These cars handle so bad.

1450
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:04,120
God damn good.
Chasing the best.

1451
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:18,880
This is so ridiculous.
Well timed by Jesus.

1452
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:30,373
God damn price you'd call the car chase.
The car chases in those days was so 

1453
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:38,580
tough.
When you see that movie with Mcqueen and

1454
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:40,750
they chasing them in San Francisco.
That Mustang.

1455
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,010
Oh,
you fucking that.

1456
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:44,060
That was so much tougher to drive that 
car.

1457
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:45,800
Oh yeah.
That shit.

1458
01:08:45,801 --> 01:08:46,634
Now today it's easy.
This is when you had to be a fucking 

1459
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,470
monster.
Know these cars are dog shit.

1460
01:08:51,471 --> 01:08:53,150
Like,
look how skinny his tires are.

1461
01:08:53,151 --> 01:08:53,984
You see how skinny those tires are.
There's like no traction on those 

1462
01:08:57,111 --> 01:09:00,070
fucking things.
Mechanical Grip is nothing.

1463
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:01,183
This guy,

1464
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:10,300
oh my goodness.
This bad mother fucker.

1465
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:13,670
Terrorists shit up in this country.
Seven.

1466
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:15,710
This is before Cannibal run,
right?

1467
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,720
Yeah.
This was when he was still.

1468
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,470
I liked how savage got the trunk 
magically closed fist now.

1469
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:24,480
Now he still listened to the same songs.
I don't care.

1470
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,370
He don't eat.
He hit.

1471
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:30,140
He hit rewind and track.
Look at the cigarettes.

1472
01:09:30,141 --> 01:09:31,760
He smokes too.
He ain't fuck.

1473
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:33,960
This was him.
Okay.

1474
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:34,794
This is a different America.
This was him against Clint Eastwood 

1475
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,520
Against Charles Bronson Against James 
Coburn.

1476
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:41,503
You had to do this crazy type shit.
Smacked bitches and shit together to 

1477
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:49,840
drive this car often in the shop because
he doesn't want them to catch him.

1478
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,740
Don't you understand Brian?

1479
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,920
Yeah,
but how did he put the gas back then?

1480
01:09:54,921 --> 01:09:55,754
The coast cars with dog shit.
You can just fucking forward button it 

1481
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:01,853
goes to the car while he goes to the bar
and the cops come in and he's sitting 

1482
01:10:03,981 --> 01:10:04,814
there fucking habit and then like step 
away from the ball and the little guy 

1483
01:10:07,431 --> 01:10:09,110
goes,
why did you throw up car on the ocean?

1484
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:11,043
Because it needed a carwash.
Jamie put on the chase scene from 

1485
01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:18,110
bullet.
I watched bullet this year.

1486
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:22,850
I was up in Canada and it was on tv,
but you got to sit there and go,

1487
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:24,213
what the fuck were they thinking?
I watched it from the beginning to the 

1488
01:10:26,001 --> 01:10:26,834
end.
It was full of Steve McQueen cop movie 

1489
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:31,053
in San Francisco and they have a crazy 
scene with the 68 Mustang where McQueen 

1490
01:10:34,551 --> 01:10:35,384
is chasing this guy.
This guy's chasing him and a dodge 

1491
01:10:36,651 --> 01:10:37,790
charger.
Oh,

1492
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:39,380
it's one of the all time.
Great car scenes.

1493
01:10:39,381 --> 01:10:40,214
Look at this shit.
This guy's got this gigantic dodge 

1494
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:45,530
charger and he's got this dope 68 
Mustang,

1495
01:10:45,531 --> 01:10:49,220
which for cars back then handled a 
really God damn good.

1496
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,550
I mean that was a lightweight car,
was a good amount of power,

1497
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,800
but you know the drum brakes and shitty 
suspension and so these guys are driving

1498
01:10:57,801 --> 01:10:59,680
around the corners in these bars.

1499
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:09,290
Let's pull it back.
This was when you were a stock man.

1500
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,780
This guy's in the hospital.
Fuck fate is.

1501
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,070
That guy actually got thousand stitches 
and

1502
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,903
shit.
That's when you fucking were a stunt 

1503
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:18,060
man.
They didn't have pads or nothing.

1504
01:11:18,061 --> 01:11:21,240
You did it with wranglers on.
How much a Steve McQueen zone driving.

1505
01:11:21,241 --> 01:11:22,074
Did he do?
I don't know how much in the movie 

1506
01:11:24,331 --> 01:11:26,790
because he's obviously doing some of it.
He could drive his asshole.

1507
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:27,890
Yeah,
he could drive his ass.

1508
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:30,060
He used to write the movie.
He played with this.

1509
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,690
What was the name of them?
Let the mom.

1510
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,060
He plays a great movie that I forgot all
about that movie.

1511
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:40,590
A lump and it's another movie that there
for like 10 minutes.

1512
01:11:40,591 --> 01:11:44,500
Nobody says a word.
That's the thing about this chasing.

1513
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:47,730
One of the craziest things about it is 
how well orchestrated it is.

1514
01:11:47,731 --> 01:11:48,564
How cool it is.
Like that skinny ass bitch just would 

1515
01:11:50,851 --> 01:11:52,830
not work for other people to walk out of
this movie.

1516
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:54,211
Are they?
Would they have?

1517
01:11:54,211 --> 01:11:55,660
No,
not me,

1518
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:59,370
but today the attention span for a big 
time movie for sure.

1519
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:03,450
People are used to these smash cuts and 
they used to MTV style editing,

1520
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:05,280
you know,
like music videos,

1521
01:12:05,281 --> 01:12:09,660
like the champions of like quick editing
at Eddie Bravo again.

1522
01:12:09,661 --> 01:12:11,850
Explain that to me.
He was talking to me about how they make

1523
01:12:11,851 --> 01:12:14,070
music videos.
Have you ever noticed they're constantly

1524
01:12:14,071 --> 01:12:17,160
switching angles.
Constantly changing the way it looks.

1525
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,173
He goes,
you don't have a static image for like 

1526
01:12:19,621 --> 01:12:21,180
60 seconds,
you know,

1527
01:12:21,181 --> 01:12:22,440
like someone's standing there.
He goes,

1528
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:23,910
that's really rare.
Most of the time,

1529
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:25,103
especially pop songs are constantly 
trying to move the image around to keep 

1530
01:12:27,781 --> 01:12:31,200
you interested in it.
But this movie like,

1531
01:12:31,201 --> 01:12:32,280
look,
we're watching this guy,

1532
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,640
load shells knew his shotgun for like 20
seconds.

1533
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,073
Fucking.
They set everything up in a different 

1534
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:41,010
way.
If the beginning of the mechanic,

1535
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,770
that's not a word for the first fourth 
pain minutes,

1536
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:46,680
he just watches the guy and sets them 
up.

1537
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:48,630
Same thing.
You're sitting there going,

1538
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:52,500
what's going on man?
Fuck it up that dodge charger.

1539
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,393
Oh,
between this movie and the Dukes of 

1540
01:12:54,781 --> 01:12:56,250
Hazzard,
more people fucked up.

1541
01:12:56,251 --> 01:12:57,084
Dodge chargers hurts my soul.
I watched the Dukes of hazzard and 

1542
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:02,904
watched that fucking car make a jump and
wants to frame bend and then they just 

1543
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:06,594
drive away just to.
And you know that the car that they 

1544
01:13:08,201 --> 01:13:10,170
jumped with is not the car they're 
driving with.

1545
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,230
Where they put you put.
They put a kid on it,

1546
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:14,250
correct.
Well,

1547
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:15,143
you know,
they just got a bunch of them and they 

1548
01:13:16,681 --> 01:13:19,950
just broke a bunch of them and they.
But they did have some fake ones too,

1549
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:21,133
like some other cars with like a charger
body shell that they would sacrifice 

1550
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,340
Miami Vice.
All those scars were just kids.

1551
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:26,910
Yeah.
Oh,

1552
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:30,870
for those Ferrari's Johnson's was a kid 
that was the fuck at Testa.

1553
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:32,580
Rossa wasn't really.
It was a kid.

1554
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,130
It wasn't a real test to Rosa.
No kidding.

1555
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:36,413
Wow.
I've seen a Miata and somebody turned 

1556
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:40,560
into a Testarossa.
No,

1557
01:13:40,561 --> 01:13:41,610
not on me.
I'm sorry.

1558
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:42,723
A fierro.
Remember those fieros Pontiac fieros my 

1559
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:49,950
sister had.
Was the trade in value on those was when

1560
01:13:49,951 --> 01:13:53,160
you brought those back there,
like 800 people would crack right there.

1561
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:56,180
Like a statue.
I paid 8,000.

1562
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:58,230
Oh Shit.
I forgot about that scene.

1563
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,400
The guy loses the car and goes right 
into the gas station and it blows up.

1564
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:05,410
Oh,
he almost lost cars and muscle cars.

1565
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,833
They still have them today.
I was looking in the back of a one of 

1566
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:10,044
those,
a hot rod magazines and they had this 

1567
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:12,634
kit car thing.
It was like not that much money either 

1568
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:18,040
for the kit and you put it together 
yourself and you have to.

1569
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,450
I think you have to put an engine in it.

1570
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:21,850
You have to do the whole thing,
but some people actually do that.

1571
01:14:21,851 --> 01:14:26,800
They actually build their own cars.
For my first car when I was 15,

1572
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:27,693
that was one of my options.
It was to get a army kit car where you 

1573
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:34,450
build your own arm to get the juice with
two other 50 bucks.

1574
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,370
Yeah.
I'm pulling out a different frame,

1575
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:37,360
but something crazy.
Yeah.

1576
01:14:37,361 --> 01:14:42,361
It was advertised in comic books.
I think there's a car thing.

1577
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:44,350
It's called the noble,
I think it's called,

1578
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:45,423
but it's a car.
I think it's from England and they ship 

1579
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:48,640
it over here.
It's this beautiful,

1580
01:14:48,641 --> 01:14:49,474
crazy looking sports car.
They ship it over here with no engine 

1581
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,270
and you have to get an engine put in it 
so I can.

1582
01:14:54,271 --> 01:14:55,690
So it's not really.
I mean it's,

1583
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:58,960
they don't consider it a car when you 
buy it and that's how they could sell it

1584
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:01,130
to you because it's not,
you know,

1585
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:02,223
doesn't have all the.

1586
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:06,520
It doesn't pass all the regulations that
you knew how to do that.

1587
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,040
Is Maserati the Italian car?
Yes.

1588
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:11,800
They had it when they were shipping cars
over in the seventies.

1589
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,950
They had to take the edge inside and 
shit.

1590
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,450
So the mafia couldn't steal the cars.
Really?

1591
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,320
Yeah.
They also,

1592
01:15:17,321 --> 01:15:18,154
when they sent the Italian shoes over 
after a while they would just send cog 

1593
01:15:21,071 --> 01:15:21,904
was right shoes and then goes with left 
shoes because life that they wouldn't 

1594
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:26,410
get robbed.
That's hilarious.

1595
01:15:26,411 --> 01:15:27,244
Fucking hilarious.
They would rob the fucking fucking docs 

1596
01:15:30,031 --> 01:15:32,200
or the Italian shoes?
Well,

1597
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:33,034
the docs have always been known,
has been like one of the places for 

1598
01:15:35,321 --> 01:15:36,154
organized crime,
right on the waterfront with Marlon 

1599
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:40,090
Brando,
my buddy Joe Lake,

1600
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,530
we were talking about,
he was a teamster.

1601
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:45,830
He was a longshoreman and you know,
long shoreman like that.

1602
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,713
That whole world has always been 
depicted in movies as being organized 

1603
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:51,910
crime headquarters.

1604
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:53,890
They make down by the docks.
You know,

1605
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:55,660
there's always like,
people like that,

1606
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:56,753
you know,
that are like the rough hard tumble 

1607
01:15:59,110 --> 01:15:59,943
travel alone dime.
You could buy jackets that comes off 

1608
01:16:04,511 --> 01:16:05,344
those four.
I have a friend till this day I talked 

1609
01:16:06,971 --> 01:16:10,280
to him yesterday.
Still drives cars off the ships.

1610
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,230
That's true.
Those were 11.

1611
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:12,243
Wow.
So the ships come in with like Honda's 

1612
01:16:13,511 --> 01:16:18,420
and shit out 40 fucking dollars an hour 
plus overtime drugs since he was in high

1613
01:16:18,421 --> 01:16:19,420
school.
Oh,

1614
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:20,710
this is what I was going to ask you 
earlier,

1615
01:16:20,711 --> 01:16:22,330
but I didn't want to interrupt your 
story.

1616
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:26,650
The reason why did they grow heroin in 
other countries.

1617
01:16:26,651 --> 01:16:27,970
I don't even know if you know the answer
to this,

1618
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:28,923
but they grow it in other countries 
because they can't grow it here or did 

1619
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:34,590
they grow it in other countries because 
it's not financially viable?

1620
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:35,800
The poppy seed.

1621
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:36,763
Well,
listen,

1622
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,680
let me tell you something.
If I need a drug dealer,

1623
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:42,160
could grow poppy seeds here and 
eliminate the travel,

1624
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:44,980
they would have done it,
but would they have what I'm saying?

1625
01:16:44,981 --> 01:16:48,070
What I'm thinking?
I could cut that cost out.

1626
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,410
Eliminate that whole fucking journey.
I don't.

1627
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:51,583
I think you need a lot of land.
I think it's one of those things that 

1628
01:16:53,941 --> 01:16:56,920
would be really hard to do indoors 
because I think it's something that they

1629
01:16:56,921 --> 01:17:01,150
do like when they make heroin,
you need a lot of land to make a smaller

1630
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:03,220
amount of heroin than you would think.
Seed.

1631
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,073
This comes from heroin,
comes from the poppy plant and I think 

1632
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:09,040
it's high out.
It's like coca leaves,

1633
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:10,400
don't they grow cocoa?
Lucy,

1634
01:17:10,401 --> 01:17:12,170
are you fucking.
That's exactly the same question,

1635
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,850
but I heard now that that's a big a 
market now.

1636
01:17:16,851 --> 01:17:17,684
People important coca leaves people in 
Beverly Hills now having coachella 

1637
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,193
parties,
which cigar will you choose and you 

1638
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:28,280
smoke a cigar and drink one and people 
get fucked up.

1639
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,250
That's the room at like $300 of leaf.
I don't know what the deal is.

1640
01:17:31,251 --> 01:17:33,380
I've never eaten no fucking leaves.
I would.

1641
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:36,530
The people in the high altitude out 
Peru,

1642
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,960
they have bags of these things they take
with them.

1643
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:39,794
It's really kind of freaky to watch and 
they packed their mouths with it and 

1644
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:42,824
they.
They have like a squirrel size lump on 

1645
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:47,180
the side of their face and they just 
chew these fucking chewing tobacco.

1646
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:50,000
Only cocoa leaves except it's actually 
kind of healthy for you.

1647
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,340
It's not bad for x before you read the 
good,

1648
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,673
what was I?
There's a fucking new drug that you see 

1649
01:17:56,121 --> 01:17:57,380
this.
This crocodile?

1650
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:59,510
Yeah.
It's been awhile around for awhile.

1651
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:03,500
What the fuck is this?
Where they take the lottery.

1652
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,630
They processed it to something else.
They put two drugs in this.

1653
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:10,430
That's a Lane and Red Sofa.
That should tell you right there.

1654
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:12,680
That's not the drug for me.
Right or wrong.

1655
01:18:12,681 --> 01:18:15,620
When you put gasoline and then it eats 
to skin.

1656
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:20,570
Yeah,
it's causing some of this get you.

1657
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,363
I think it starts out when they just 
have like a little bit of like a bruise 

1658
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:26,633
area are fucked up area and then they,
they just get hooked on shooting it in 

1659
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,273
and they keep shooting in that spot.
It keeps getting worse and worse and 

1660
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:35,800
it's just not getting better.
And then it starts really going down the

1661
01:18:35,801 --> 01:18:38,420
hill and then they get super depressed 
and they keep shooting in there.

1662
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,940
I think it's a,
it's a real bad drug,

1663
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:42,650
real dangerous,
scary drug.

1664
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:44,630
And apparently they're doing it when 
they can't get heroin,

1665
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:45,670
you know,
that's,

1666
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:48,380
that's how a lot of it got started where
I read online.

1667
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:50,000
But uh,
the images of their.

1668
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:50,834
Correct.
It fills a real images of people's 

1669
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:52,400
bones.

1670
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,640
Poked out of their schedule.
Yeah.

1671
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:56,630
That really is true.
That's a spooky as fuck.

1672
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,300
Like when your bones are exposed,
you got a problem.

1673
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:01,040
It's a problem.
It's a real problem.

1674
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:04,610
I used to cope with a guy that while he 
was talking to you,

1675
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:06,283
he'd have to get the straw and then put 
like a paperclip and his nose because 

1676
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:12,710
the skin had collapsed,
so we had to pick the skin up,

1677
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,470
put the dollar in there,
and then Snowden,

1678
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:19,490
oh my God,
and this was navy.

1679
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:21,710
I can't.
Now he's missing this.

1680
01:19:21,711 --> 01:19:26,030
Knows like he ain't even breathe and eat
fucking five.

1681
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:29,630
Last time I spelled it with that guy and
they would have to pick up the wall from

1682
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:32,300
Jamie.
Find out why they don't grow cocaine.

1683
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:34,000
The United States.
Imagine that Shit.

1684
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:34,873
Someone on the message where it says it 
takes an acre of coca leaves to make a 

1685
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:40,370
kilo so that you need like slave labor 
to collect process.

1686
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:43,630
That does make some sense.
Some brother,

1687
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:46,010
they could do it here.
They would have done it trust.

1688
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:51,600
They had the financing,
they've had the fucking money and that's

1689
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,840
something they could have hit it back 
then,

1690
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:54,530
right?
No,

1691
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:55,363
they can't do it.
There's a reason why they can't do it 

1692
01:19:57,081 --> 01:19:58,660
here.
It's about the out the to this.

1693
01:19:58,661 --> 01:20:02,090
Something in the soil is some reason 
both of those things,

1694
01:20:02,091 --> 01:20:05,600
if not some drug dealer with a high and 
a chemist and said,

1695
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,920
bring it over.
Some Chinese guy,

1696
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:10,440
okay.
With tons of loot where they got another

1697
01:20:10,441 --> 01:20:13,560
genius Chinese guy 30 years ago and 
said,

1698
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:17,290
teach us how to grow this shit in Jersey
and that's it.

1699
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:20,550
It would have eliminated everything,
but there's some reason why,

1700
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:21,990
you know,
you just can't.

1701
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:22,913
They made synthetic heroin yet,
but you need that Chinese white shit on 

1702
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:28,674
this coast.
They have the Mexican that thought that 

1703
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:33,270
Shit,
you just shoot and you smoke.

1704
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,553
But on the east coast,
that's that white powders with suburban 

1705
01:20:36,871 --> 01:20:37,704
kids.
Like that's what the models get hooked 

1706
01:20:39,181 --> 01:20:41,640
on because it's two bunks and you're 
done.

1707
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:43,480
You're done.
It's like,

1708
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,310
well now they're making a pure of the 
never.

1709
01:20:46,311 --> 01:20:46,810
It's,
it's,

1710
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:47,643
you know,
because it's coming from Afghanistan 

1711
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:49,321
gum,
you know,

1712
01:20:49,321 --> 01:20:49,790
this,
this,

1713
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:51,000
this,
next war.

1714
01:20:51,001 --> 01:20:53,490
This last war when this started after 
nine slash 11,

1715
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,640
this picked up heroin again.
It started coming in here again,

1716
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:57,863
especially in the Detroit area.
Detroit is not as fucked up as it is 

1717
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,580
because you know,
it's fucked up.

1718
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:03,903
It's because they just through heroin 
and that I couldn't fucking handle it 

1719
01:21:06,511 --> 01:21:08,940
man.
And the same thing happened in Newark.

1720
01:21:08,941 --> 01:21:09,774
New Jersey had happened in a couple 
areas I know about because I have 

1721
01:21:12,391 --> 01:21:15,540
friends that you and they'd tell you 
this and you're like,

1722
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:16,403
hmm,
that's interesting that this happened 

1723
01:21:17,701 --> 01:21:18,540
after nine slash 11.

1724
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:20,520
Wow.
So,

1725
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:22,700
well,
I mean the production,

1726
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:23,543
the heroine has gone through.
The roof in Africa was done through the 

1727
01:21:25,411 --> 01:21:26,244
roof now and there's all sorts of 
reasons why they have excuses why they 

1728
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:31,350
let them do it or why it's happening or 
why,

1729
01:21:31,351 --> 01:21:32,184
you know,
the,

1730
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:35,220
the army helps them.
So pills or at their all time,

1731
01:21:35,221 --> 01:21:37,590
highest and heroines at their all time.
Highest.

1732
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:41,730
Or were they making the pills from,
do they need actual heroin to make those

1733
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:42,564
pills?
Do they need poppy seeds that need 

1734
01:21:44,741 --> 01:21:47,430
something to a poppies to some of it is 
probably something.

1735
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,200
It's probably all synthetic.
Right?

1736
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:50,700
But what does that mean though?
Like what,

1737
01:21:50,701 --> 01:21:52,800
where are they getting the compounds to 
put it together?

1738
01:21:52,801 --> 01:21:54,480
Like what is it?
Where did it come from?

1739
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:58,230
And they have to have like a raw version
of something that turns into heroin.

1740
01:21:58,231 --> 01:21:59,940
Right?
I mean when you say synthetic,

1741
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:02,460
it's not like you press a three d 
printer and heroin comes out.

1742
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:03,663
You have to.
There has to be things that they like a 

1743
01:22:06,451 --> 01:22:08,760
lot of pharmaceuticals we think of them 
as pharmaceuticals,

1744
01:22:08,761 --> 01:22:09,594
but a lot of them they're actually 
getting some of the chemicals from 

1745
01:22:11,311 --> 01:22:12,970
plants,
you know,

1746
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:15,650
that's one of the reasons why they mind 
the rain forest.

1747
01:22:15,651 --> 01:22:16,484
They're always looking for different 
plants that they can exploit and they 

1748
01:22:19,051 --> 01:22:21,700
can make pharmaceutical drugs out of.
It's kind of like A.

1749
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:22,553
I remember when I was a Hippie,
lot of people had synthetic pod and I 

1750
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:26,843
don't know what that even means,
but I think they just took the 

1751
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,460
compounds,
whatever makes you know,

1752
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:35,610
a real pot and just recreate in our 
somehow.

1753
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:38,310
It's like,
isn't it like ingredients?

1754
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,440
Well there was a store that I read about
Coca Cola,

1755
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:43,050
[inaudible],
Coca Cola uses real coca leaves.

1756
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:45,660
Real coke is still today.
Still today.

1757
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:49,140
They use real coca leaves and they don't
have cocaine anymore.

1758
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,213
What they do is they get these coca 
leaves and they bring them to this 

1759
01:22:52,561 --> 01:22:56,460
medical cocaine supplying and they take 
the coke out,

1760
01:22:56,461 --> 01:23:00,270
sell that to New Jersey,
exact company in New Jersey and they put

1761
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:03,150
it into pills.
They put it into medicine.

1762
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:06,010
You're right.
So that's all coming from coca

1763
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,570
leaves,
which is really crazy.

1764
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,583
Like you wouldn't have thought that you 
would have thought that like synthetic 

1765
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:14,250
cocaine or line of can or whatever the 
fuck it is they're using,

1766
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:17,680
which whatever versions of medical grade
cocaine they use,

1767
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:20,050
he would've thought somehow know that 
that's coming from chemicals.

1768
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:21,790
That's what we would think.
It's synthetic.

1769
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,370
We always like to say shit like that,
but what does that mean?

1770
01:23:24,371 --> 01:23:29,371
Like there's got to be like Ra compounds
that are used to make this stuff.

1771
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:32,740
Where are those coming from?
It's coming from the origin.

1772
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,633
I think synthetic means they take some 
of the origin and they put other shit 

1773
01:23:36,951 --> 01:23:38,970
and get the matching.
They make it cheaper for you.

1774
01:23:38,971 --> 01:23:39,804
You know?
It's like when you go to the store now 

1775
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,071
and you go,
hi,

1776
01:23:42,071 --> 01:23:43,660
I'm here to pick up my medication.
They go,

1777
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:44,494
well we have to ask you a question and 
you want the original oxycotton or the 

1778
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:49,313
Melecan,
which is the same only made in 

1779
01:23:50,501 --> 01:23:52,840
Switzerland,
but instead of $80,

1780
01:23:52,841 --> 01:23:55,180
the prescription is $28,000.
Right.

1781
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:59,710
So I shouldn't say synthetic heroin.
Synthetic opiates.

1782
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:09,250
Where do synthetic opiates come from?
The rived from opium.

1783
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,053
Well,
there's a bunch that are derived from 

1784
01:24:12,261 --> 01:24:12,981
opium.
Wow.

1785
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:15,530
That's fucking bloody list.
Morphine,

1786
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,730
codeine,
heroin,

1787
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:20,750
t bain and or have been.
Huh?

1788
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:22,063
I didn't know

1789
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:25,200
coding,
heroin,

1790
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,560
heroin and morphine.
How similar are they?

1791
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:31,520
Right.
It's like the same.

1792
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,050
Really.
That's what I've heard.

1793
01:24:33,051 --> 01:24:33,884
I mean I don't use them obviously,
but that I've heard that's true that 

1794
01:24:35,661 --> 01:24:39,750
I've done heroin.
Gay Cousin.

1795
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:44,990
I was on a morphine drip when I go to 
the operated on my first time.

1796
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,640
It was amazing.
Oh my God.

1797
01:24:46,641 --> 01:24:49,160
I kept hitting that button.
He hit the button whenever you want.

1798
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:51,640
This is like 1993.
They didn't regulate you,

1799
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:53,723
so I was lying in this bed.
My knee was killing me and I hit that 

1800
01:24:55,731 --> 01:24:58,620
button and it would be like Nyquil,
like taking Nyquil,

1801
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:02,000
like clip clip.
That's probably what heroin.

1802
01:25:02,001 --> 01:25:03,710
So [inaudible].
It's pretty sweet.

1803
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:05,390
Let's do it.
So I've done it.

1804
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:07,070
So there you go.
I've done heroin.

1805
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:09,970
I didn't even think I did,
but then I remembered that uh,

1806
01:25:10,030 --> 01:25:12,710
that one night that I had to stay in the
hospital and um,

1807
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:15,110
I had my acl reconstructed.

1808
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:15,973
That's where they,
they had me there and I was done with a 

1809
01:25:17,211 --> 01:25:19,610
patellar tendon graft.
That's how they did it back then.

1810
01:25:19,611 --> 01:25:20,444
There was a good way to do it.
Sometimes they still do it that way 

1811
01:25:21,771 --> 01:25:22,604
today,
but they're taking a chunk of bone off 

1812
01:25:24,261 --> 01:25:29,261
my knee and a chunk of bone off my shin 
and a sliver of my patella tendon.

1813
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:30,373
And then they open you up like a fish 
screw this piece of meat and use the 

1814
01:25:33,981 --> 01:25:34,814
bone piece that they cut out of the Shin
and the bone piece that they cut out of 

1815
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:38,683
the a kneecap and then they reconstruct 
the knee and it hurts like a 

1816
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:43,400
motherfucker.
Dude.

1817
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,680
Woo.
It's like,

1818
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:45,603
like,
like lightning bolts shooting when 

1819
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,610
whenever you cut into bone and drills.
Like it's the one.

1820
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,760
The other one that I had done,
I had done with the cadaver,

1821
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,680
like way easier.

1822
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:56,630
I mean,
I mean like almost nothing.

1823
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,040
Like I went to uh,
you know,

1824
01:25:58,041 --> 01:25:58,874
Matt Lichtenberg,
I went to his birthday party five days 

1825
01:26:01,071 --> 01:26:03,620
after the operation just walked.
It was fine.

1826
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:04,280
Like,
I,

1827
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,050
you know,
I had a brace on it.

1828
01:26:06,051 --> 01:26:08,990
I didn't want to hurt myself,
but I didn't need crutches.

1829
01:26:08,991 --> 01:26:12,930
I could get around like it's totally 
different than the Patella tendon graft.

1830
01:26:12,931 --> 01:26:16,670
Your leg blows up like a fucking blue,
but I'm lying in bed and they have me on

1831
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:17,504
this continuous motion machine.
From the moment you come into the 

1832
01:26:18,951 --> 01:26:20,740
operating room,
they put you on a deal.

1833
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:21,613
They don't want your leg to stiffen up 
because then it's really hard to get to 

1834
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:24,740
get moving again.
You know,

1835
01:26:24,741 --> 01:26:26,240
once you,
once you get really rigid,

1836
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,313
you know the trauma sets in and it's 
really difficult to straighten your leg 

1837
01:26:29,841 --> 01:26:30,674
out.
So right away they have you on this 

1838
01:26:31,581 --> 01:26:32,500
thing.
It's like boom,

1839
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:33,383
boom,
boom,

1840
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:36,920
boom.
So not only you in agony but your leg is

1841
01:26:36,921 --> 01:26:38,510
on this continuum machine.

1842
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:46,220
More morphine is commonly related to his
morphine sulfate.

1843
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:47,083
Heroin is diacetyl morphine that is,
heroin is simply morphine with an asset 

1844
01:26:51,591 --> 01:26:55,130
whole molecule attach a subtle,
subtle,

1845
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,440
subtle,
more molecule attached.

1846
01:26:57,530 --> 01:27:00,260
So it's basically same shit.
It just is.

1847
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,140
So it does it faster.
Yeah.

1848
01:27:03,141 --> 01:27:03,974
In terms of the effects,
they are exactly the same and medically 

1849
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:07,880
interchangeable except for the dosage.
In fact,

1850
01:27:07,881 --> 01:27:12,110
they're both converted to the same form 
of morphine when they get into the body.

1851
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:13,690
Fascinating.
Thank you.

1852
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:14,590
Yeah,
it's all this.

1853
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:15,320
You know,
when,

1854
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:19,670
when you had surgery I had given you 
heroin.

1855
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:21,110
Isn't that amazing?
Given your age,

1856
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,200
different forum.
It's not the street level,

1857
01:27:24,201 --> 01:27:27,680
but it's a form of what you're getting 
this tremendous.

1858
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:29,200
Who doesn't like that?
Uh,

1859
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,823
my friend's mom had a cancer and uh,
she went through all the channels and 

1860
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:35,144
she was on her way out and she decided 
to go out on her own by taking all and 

1861
01:27:37,681 --> 01:27:40,010
morphine just said,
look,

1862
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,270
what a beautiful way to do it.

1863
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:42,920
Just do it.
Like this.

1864
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:44,030
Just took it all,
you know,

1865
01:27:44,031 --> 01:27:44,864
they were giving her something for pain 
and I guess she had enough to stop the 

1866
01:27:47,691 --> 01:27:50,960
thicker and she just says enough.
I was just like,

1867
01:27:50,961 --> 01:27:52,340
I'm wasting away you.
She goes,

1868
01:27:52,341 --> 01:27:53,960
there's no hope.
Like it's over.

1869
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:55,310
Like her body was.
It was over.

1870
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:58,760
It was like the last few days.
But that's how she decided to do it.

1871
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:00,230
You got to respect that,
you know,

1872
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:02,750
like the fact that that's illegal,
you know,

1873
01:28:02,751 --> 01:28:05,930
I know it would be abused.
I know it could be abused by people that

1874
01:28:05,931 --> 01:28:07,300
want to kill people.
You know,

1875
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,840
all my mom wanted to go,
you know,

1876
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:12,710
you could,
you could run into those types of people

1877
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:13,813
that would actually kill family member 
to get some money from the will kill a 

1878
01:28:15,981 --> 01:28:17,420
wife,
you know,

1879
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:18,920
those,
those kinds of things.

1880
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:22,430
But I think that still for someone who's
dying,

1881
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:23,201
man,
for your,

1882
01:28:23,201 --> 01:28:24,034
your mom or something like that,
when it's the last days and you got to 

1883
01:28:26,091 --> 01:28:30,440
watch her just in agony constantly with 
no light at the end of the tunnel,

1884
01:28:30,441 --> 01:28:31,274
you know,
she's 90 years old or whatever the hell 

1885
01:28:32,091 --> 01:28:34,710
she is like fuck man.
Like you,

1886
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:37,340
you gotta have a heart man.
That shit should be legal.

1887
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:40,280
You should be able to do that.
And in some places it is,

1888
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:41,480
right?
It's legal in Oregon,

1889
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:43,430
like there was at one girl that was 
trying to um,

1890
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,620
do that change.
Moved to Oregon.

1891
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:46,850
Did she do it?
Yeah,

1892
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:50,290
she ended up delaying it a couple days 
and then she and she did it.

1893
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:54,403
It's crazy shit man.
I think you gotta be there to really 

1894
01:28:56,061 --> 01:28:56,894
make a decision on that.
It's just some people get tired of 

1895
01:29:01,171 --> 01:29:02,310
fighting,
you know,

1896
01:29:02,311 --> 01:29:05,730
you get tired or you get weary from the 
illness just draining you.

1897
01:29:05,731 --> 01:29:09,600
And then the chemotherapy drains you 
sometimes even further.

1898
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:11,030
And it's hard,
you know,

1899
01:29:11,031 --> 01:29:11,864
the last days,
what's amazing is how many people 

1900
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:17,610
benefit from cbd for marijuana and how 
few people are getting it.

1901
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:19,133
You know,
the more I read about this and the more 

1902
01:29:20,191 --> 01:29:25,170
I talk to people that have had it and 
talk to people that have loved ones that

1903
01:29:25,171 --> 01:29:28,530
have tried it on cancer and had 
incredible results can be.

1904
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:29,364
It just drives me nuts.
It's just so hard to believe that that 

1905
01:29:31,201 --> 01:29:32,034
stuff's still demonized,
that people are still pretending that 

1906
01:29:33,841 --> 01:29:38,190
it's one of the worst things that 
society can make legal where for just if

1907
01:29:38,191 --> 01:29:40,860
it only did that with cancer,
forget about the getting high part.

1908
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:41,933
If it only did that for cancer,
do you know how magical that drug would 

1909
01:29:44,821 --> 01:29:47,970
it be?
It's like it's got this creepy passed.

1910
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:48,983
It's like a,
a stripper that wrote the most amazing 

1911
01:29:50,431 --> 01:29:51,900
book,
but nobody wants to listen to it because

1912
01:29:51,901 --> 01:29:52,734
she used to be a stripper.
It's got like marijuana has this like 

1913
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:56,543
seedy part to it and that CD part keeps 
people from recognizing the textile use 

1914
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:06,810
the uses as a commodity they use for 
making houses they use for food.

1915
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,870
Like if it was just all those things and
didn't get people high,

1916
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:10,883
it would be our all time favorite plant.
It would be the number one plant in the 

1917
01:30:13,351 --> 01:30:15,150
world.
We would be using it all the time.

1918
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:17,640
They say that this hempcrete.
Have you ever heard of him?

1919
01:30:17,641 --> 01:30:19,110
Crete.
Concrete they make with him.

1920
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:20,790
It's supposed to be like,
well,

1921
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:25,850
some of the most durable,
lightweight fire resistant insulation.

1922
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:26,260
It's,
it's,

1923
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:28,470
it's,
it's great insulated properties,

1924
01:30:28,471 --> 01:30:32,790
insulation properties and it's made out 
of hemp and you can make it cheap.

1925
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:33,600
You know,
it doesn't,

1926
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,950
doesn't cost a lot of money to grow 
hemp.

1927
01:30:34,951 --> 01:30:35,784
They just can't grow it.
Like in that you can't even get high 

1928
01:30:37,081 --> 01:30:38,100
from this shit.
I mean,

1929
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:40,050
it's really crazy if you stopped and 
thought about it,

1930
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:41,003
if it was a plot in a movie,
if there was something that was as 

1931
01:30:42,841 --> 01:30:43,674
powerful as the marijuana plant,
it was something that had so many 

1932
01:30:45,991 --> 01:30:46,824
benefits and it was somehow another kept
illegal and somehow none of the 

1933
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:50,514
propaganda kept people thinking that it 
would be one of the worst things for 

1934
01:30:52,921 --> 01:30:55,020
society.
If they were to make this legal,

1935
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:56,330
you would lose your fucking mind.
You would.

1936
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:59,070
You would go to this movie stupid like 
this movie is dumb.

1937
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,850
People would riot.
They wouldn't do it,

1938
01:31:00,851 --> 01:31:03,740
and come on,
you got something that cures epilepsy in

1939
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:04,740
kids.

1940
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:06,960
Little kids that have epilepsy.
Have you seen any different?

1941
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:09,600
Fucking kids have benefited johnny 
rotten.

1942
01:31:09,601 --> 01:31:10,800
Yeah.
Our buddy johnny,

1943
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:12,960
his kid was having all sorts of 
seizures.

1944
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:13,913
He moves up to Seattle.
It gets them on the medical marijuana 

1945
01:31:15,511 --> 01:31:17,610
program.
Boom goes away.

1946
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:18,833
It goes away.
It gets 100 times better and the kid 

1947
01:31:19,981 --> 01:31:21,750
starts communicating,
changed his life,

1948
01:31:21,751 --> 01:31:23,730
change that kid's life.
Fuck man.

1949
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:24,713
It's just weird.
It's one of the weirdest parts about 

1950
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,420
being alive in 2015 is that there's so 
many improvements going on.

1951
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:31,523
There's so much fascinating shit 
happening in our culture and yet this 

1952
01:31:33,781 --> 01:31:34,614
one thing,
it's like this hold out this clawing 

1953
01:31:37,381 --> 01:31:41,190
thing that cleans to the sword.
It's not that.

1954
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:46,230
It's the people's reaction that gets me 
still like I'm the type of guy that,

1955
01:31:46,231 --> 01:31:49,350
you know what man?
I didn't eat Sushi till 1995,

1956
01:31:49,351 --> 01:31:51,270
but I came around,
you know,

1957
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,610
when I was in New York,
fuck you raw fish.

1958
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,930
You know what I'm saying?
Real fresh.

1959
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:58,790
You know what the fuck?
But then one day I came around,

1960
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,250
I never said I hated Sushi.

1961
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:01,900
I just said it wasn't for me at the 
time.

1962
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:05,140
And you listen to a fucking moron like 
governor Christie,

1963
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,333
who just aggravates me.
It aggravates me that this guy is 

1964
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:10,380
running for president this fucking 
years.

1965
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:13,300
President fucking list is horrible.
Thank God I'm.

1966
01:32:13,301 --> 01:32:14,134
I'm happy I got felonies to vote like 
these motherfuckers from the Cuban dude 

1967
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:24,200
to Christie will bad shape those 
ridiculous.

1968
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,860
A ridiculous,
ridiculous person.

1969
01:32:26,890 --> 01:32:28,600
He's so ridiculous.
Oh my God,

1970
01:32:28,601 --> 01:32:31,030
I cannot fight.
I'm so happy I don't live in Jersey,

1971
01:32:31,031 --> 01:32:32,560
man.
I'm so fucking happy,

1972
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:33,543
but you know when he's so marked I just,
I can't imagine him ever and he's got 

1973
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:37,803
that whole bridge things gonna hold them
back so that he's not going to get 

1974
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:40,654
enough.
But what he will do in doing this as 

1975
01:32:42,731 --> 01:32:46,870
raise his public profile and maybe he's 
pretty good at debating.

1976
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:47,973
He's pretty good at talking and maybe if
he has these conversations in front of 

1977
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:52,110
America,
you know,

1978
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,620
the way he's been having them in New 
Jersey,

1979
01:32:53,621 --> 01:32:56,290
maybe in a big public forum like 
presidential debates,

1980
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:57,670
it can be kind of interesting.

1981
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,600
Could be interesting to hear him talk 
because he as Moronica as he is,

1982
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:03,910
he still a very good talker.
You know,

1983
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:04,490
he gets,
I,

1984
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:07,090
I disagree with a lot of the shit that 
he says,

1985
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:10,960
but I got to respect the fact that the 
guy knows how to communicate sometimes.

1986
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:12,740
That's all you need in this goofy ass 
world.

1987
01:33:12,741 --> 01:33:16,090
Somebody writes you a good juicy script.
You have a bunch of people behind you.

1988
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:18,700
They give you a little makeover.
They tried to do that with them.

1989
01:33:18,701 --> 01:33:20,710
They got them on that fucking belly 
band,

1990
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:23,680
but somehow or another it didn't work 
like he still big.

1991
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:26,260
Right.
I mean he did get on that.

1992
01:33:26,261 --> 01:33:27,094
Right.
Find out if he did that because that's 

1993
01:33:28,451 --> 01:33:29,740
ridiculous.
It is.

1994
01:33:29,741 --> 01:33:32,380
The way I look at it,
I grew up in northern New Jersey.

1995
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:37,860
I grew up in politicians home and I know
that to be a politician in New Jersey,

1996
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:39,423
somewhere along the line you got to take
an envelope and when you're running for 

1997
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:45,544
president,
it's pretty tough to take an envelope 

1998
01:33:47,171 --> 01:33:48,160
and people have to fuck them.

1999
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,993
Raised their hand.
It's like Donald Trump when he raised 

2000
01:33:52,091 --> 01:33:54,190
his hand,
I could not believe it.

2001
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:55,583
Yeah,
just what he did in New York in the 

2002
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:59,110
eighties.
You know,

2003
01:33:59,140 --> 01:33:59,973
if that guy even moved.
What did he do in New York and in New 

2004
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:04,990
York in the eighties when he was 
building all those things.

2005
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:08,050
Hold onto when we do once the rant.
Start going,

2006
01:34:08,051 --> 01:34:11,440
don't pull it up.
When he went in the eighties when he was

2007
01:34:11,441 --> 01:34:13,900
doing all of that developing.
Okay.

2008
01:34:13,901 --> 01:34:17,860
He shut up like Rogan construction.
Okay.

2009
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:21,370
Rogan construction was started by you.
I'm just making a name.

2010
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:22,223
Right.
Okay.

2011
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:23,223
Okay.
He rogan construction was a company 

2012
01:34:25,691 --> 01:34:27,070
started by your grandpa.
No.

2013
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:32,100
Work and his two brothers and then he 
hired the sons and now they have 12 full

2014
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:33,124
time employees and they've been putzing 
along since 1948 doing new construction 

2015
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:39,453
houses and remodels,
but whatever they're keeping their 

2016
01:34:41,381 --> 01:34:42,214
lights on and all of a sudden the GC 
comes in who's a general contractor on 

2017
01:34:46,151 --> 01:34:46,984
this job,
who somebody like fucking trump and he 

2018
01:34:49,181 --> 01:34:54,181
hires people like Rogan construction and
a search electric and who?

2019
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:58,070
God's fucking plumbing and got sucked my
dick concrete,

2020
01:34:58,600 --> 01:34:59,433
you know,
whatever the fuck the name of the 

2021
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:05,261
company is selling to make a teacher and
it would stiffen and all these companies

2022
01:35:05,781 --> 01:35:08,990
went out of business.
All that construction he did in New York

2023
01:35:08,991 --> 01:35:12,540
and New Jersey in the eighties was very 
such bad.

2024
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,320
Number two,
before he raised his hand,

2025
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:18,320
I hope.
I hope that he's just intelligent.

2026
01:35:18,490 --> 01:35:19,670
Let me get that water.
My brother.

2027
01:35:19,671 --> 01:35:24,490
I'm sorry to fuck up your little.
I hope that he called the congressman or

2028
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:25,383
governor or somebody in Colorado and he 
said how barry this sammy the bull 

2029
01:35:29,301 --> 01:35:30,134
gravano and he get the TMZ.
Can he get through a phone because all 

2030
01:35:34,671 --> 01:35:36,920
those deals he had going on in the 
eighties,

2031
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:41,240
he was in bed with the Mafia.
It doesn't take a fucking genius to tell

2032
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:42,350
you that.
Okay.

2033
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:46,610
Just a dumpster.
The one that Johnny Reid Felon,

2034
01:35:46,611 --> 01:35:48,650
when he tried to commit suicide,
you know those dumpsters.

2035
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:53,650
You guys see a square dumpster to get 
one in Colorado in 1987 was $200 for the

2036
01:35:55,551 --> 01:35:56,384
day.
You know that same dumpster was in New 

2037
01:35:58,070 --> 01:36:01,010
York in 1987.
Twenty $200.

2038
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,550
That's how high the construction costs 
were.

2039
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:06,980
Some of it where the mafia attacks.
Well,

2040
01:36:06,981 --> 01:36:10,370
there was a lot of organized crime,
organized crime.

2041
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,790
So somewhere along the line this trump 
was embedded with organized crime.

2042
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:14,853
Had to,
had to be the trump plaza in Atlantic 

2043
01:36:17,241 --> 01:36:18,910
city.
Just look at the locations.

2044
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:21,200
Doesn't take thought of this.
We started this.

2045
01:36:21,201 --> 01:36:22,034
I always knew this idiot did not.
Could not raise his fucking hand and if 

2046
01:36:26,331 --> 01:36:29,690
anybody is smart,
go to the Sammy the bull book.

2047
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:33,550
He talks about it.
Not so many ways really,

2048
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:38,300
so I guaranteed the feds have their 
files and as soon as this guy moves up a

2049
01:36:38,301 --> 01:36:40,800
little bit,
they're going to take a look at it.

2050
01:36:40,810 --> 01:36:43,910
It says a sammy the bull told us,
how can we take care of this?

2051
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:49,520
A donation to the fucking a buffalo bull
company or fucking blind kids.

2052
01:36:49,521 --> 01:36:50,354
Whatever the fuck it takes.
Because this guy was the major 

2053
01:36:53,571 --> 01:36:57,590
contractor in New York in the eighties.
All these small businesses,

2054
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:59,780
he put their lights out.
You know how I know.

2055
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:03,560
I'll tell you how I know for a fact when
I got locked up,

2056
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:04,423
one of the conditions of me getting out 
was I had to get a job to alleviate the 

2057
01:37:07,761 --> 01:37:10,310
state of Colorado.
My attorney came up with this paper,

2058
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:14,510
listen to if you let him out,
he'll leave next week.

2059
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:17,750
Tomorrow.
We've got a plan for him.

2060
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:19,490
As soon as he gets out of your fucking 
jail,

2061
01:37:19,491 --> 01:37:21,890
we'll take them out of new job.
We'll get them back to New Jersey.

2062
01:37:22,330 --> 01:37:23,163
But to do all this,
I have a promise of employment and I 

2063
01:37:26,691 --> 01:37:27,524
called around New Jersey and my friend's
uncle had a window door trim sash 

2064
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:34,130
company,
you know all this shit for your door,

2065
01:37:34,131 --> 01:37:34,964
that's a sash on the bottom by the way,
and trim around your door and the door 

2066
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:42,980
and and shades and they sold all that 
stuff and they had like an 11 man crew,

2067
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,600
like six guys on phones.

2068
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:46,590
So he goes,
you want to go?

2069
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:50,020
He made me send me the resume.
That guy's uncle and I called him.

2070
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:54,260
We spoke on the phone and in fact I 
wrote the guy while I was in prison back

2071
01:37:54,261 --> 01:37:56,490
and forth because he would tell me,
keep your head up.

2072
01:37:56,491 --> 01:37:59,790
You got a job when you get out,
don't be down on yourself.

2073
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:01,590
When I got out of the,
into the halfway house,

2074
01:38:01,591 --> 01:38:03,060
I called him and I said,
hey man,

2075
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,670
I got to sit in the halfway house but 90
days,

2076
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:07,560
but I'll be in Jersey by June.
And he goes,

2077
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:08,513
I don't think I got high.
We were working on this construction 

2078
01:38:10,861 --> 01:38:14,230
company and we got stiffed.
It was that fucking guy trump.

2079
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:18,140
We lost everything.
We had any investment really.

2080
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:19,590
You know,
these were high rises.

2081
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:22,440
You had to pay for all those windows and
he's only paid,

2082
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:23,943
you know,
they might have got a deposit or 

2083
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:26,910
something from the GC,
but not enough.

2084
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:29,400
They got stamped and then just put them 
under.

2085
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:30,750
Yeah.
But he would go onto,

2086
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:31,613
like he would go to,
he was the top builder and he would go 

2087
01:38:33,661 --> 01:38:36,740
to Joe Rogan construction and he would 
put it all on your name.

2088
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:40,130
So you went down to wow.
So he done all this.

2089
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:44,640
He ruined fucking family businesses and 
all of a sudden he has this short memory

2090
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:45,633
when you run for president,
they look at you in a fucking a 

2091
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:50,333
microscope microscope and you know,
I don't know what happened with the 

2092
01:38:52,201 --> 01:38:54,750
birth certificate and Obama's birth.
I never paid attention,

2093
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:56,483
but he was born in Kenya.
This is something you cannot overlook 

2094
01:38:59,461 --> 01:39:00,840
with this guy.
This guy's a prick.

2095
01:39:00,841 --> 01:39:03,810
He doesn't know any fucking this.
Well he was,

2096
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:07,950
he was one of the guys that was going on
and on about Obama's birth certificate.

2097
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:10,080
He was like one of the main guys,

2098
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:15,560
first of all,
don't look,

2099
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:18,490
just look at them as human beings.
Like when you hear them talk and you,

2100
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,860
you kinda like what they stand for.
He's my favorite president ever.

2101
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,260
Who Obama better than Clinton?
Yeah,

2102
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,660
I think Clinton,
you know,

2103
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:27,743
Clinton,
you had a lot of flavor and he did some 

2104
01:39:29,281 --> 01:39:33,170
good stuff too.
But I think Obama has been the most.

2105
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:36,090
Maybe it's just the times that we're in,
he's the most,

2106
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:41,510
the most noticeable when it comes to 
like spreading this like what I think is

2107
01:39:41,701 --> 01:39:43,560
like an improvement in the way people 
think,

2108
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,780
you know,
first of all by being black.

2109
01:39:45,781 --> 01:39:49,180
Second of all by supportive gay rights.
Really like blatant support.

2110
01:39:49,181 --> 01:39:52,410
Like where they turn the fucking White 
House rainbow when it got passed.

2111
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:55,770
I mean that's crazy shit man.
That's never existed before.

2112
01:39:55,771 --> 01:39:56,604
When you see,
when you saw that picture of the White 

2113
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:00,030
House being rainbow colored at night and
I was like,

2114
01:40:00,031 --> 01:40:01,290
this is nuts man.

2115
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:02,123
That wouldn't happen with Nixon.
This is some shit that similar to the 

2116
01:40:04,471 --> 01:40:07,350
fucking abolition of slavery.
It's similar.

2117
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:10,620
I mean,
it's not as extreme a slavery,

2118
01:40:10,621 --> 01:40:13,560
it's not as extreme of trap.
That's so amazing.

2119
01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:15,223
I mean,
but it's similar in the way that it's 

2120
01:40:16,441 --> 01:40:20,610
going to change the way people look at 
gay people.

2121
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:22,410
It's going to,
it might not be now,

2122
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:25,170
it might not be the generation of our 
parents.

2123
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,230
It might not be the generation,
uh,

2124
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:28,073
of our older brothers and sisters,
but it's going to be the generation of 

2125
01:40:30,151 --> 01:40:30,984
our kids.
The generation of our kids is going to 

2126
01:40:32,671 --> 01:40:33,504
understand that gay people.
It's just like being mad at people for 

2127
01:40:34,921 --> 01:40:37,350
having red hair.
It's just who they are.

2128
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:38,940
Like,
what do you give a fuck?

2129
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:39,983
And if you give a fuck about that,
what else are you gonna come creep it 

2130
01:40:42,481 --> 01:40:44,910
around about what are you going to fuck 
with people about?

2131
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:47,130
What is it you're going to fuck with 
people about the way they're dressed?

2132
01:40:47,330 --> 01:40:49,140
They're going to fuck with people about 
the way they talk.

2133
01:40:49,141 --> 01:40:51,930
Like what is it like leave people the 
fuck alone.

2134
01:40:51,931 --> 01:40:54,010
And the more we do that,
the more we could

2135
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,070
sort it all out and find out what is 
really bothering us.

2136
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:58,053
What's really bothering people was a lot
of what's bothering people as people 

2137
01:41:00,191 --> 01:41:01,024
intruding on other people's lives and it
doesn't get any more inclusive than in 

2138
01:41:04,421 --> 01:41:07,930
the fucking bedroom.
You're intruding on people's bedrooms.

2139
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:08,913
You care if people want to get married,
if they love each other just because 

2140
01:41:11,171 --> 01:41:12,004
they're two guys or two girls who gives 
a fuck and if you do give a fuck Europe 

2141
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:16,853
problem,
you're a problem in this free world and 

2142
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:20,793
this is just one thing that you 
ideologically attached yourself to and 

2143
01:41:24,671 --> 01:41:25,504
it might be religious based and my who 
knows what the fuck other shit you got 

2144
01:41:28,841 --> 01:41:30,670
going on in your head.
You don't want people to do.

2145
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:31,653
You know,
who knows what other weird kind of 

2146
01:41:32,681 --> 01:41:35,980
sharia law shit you want to incorporate 
in the society.

2147
01:41:35,981 --> 01:41:37,300
Who knows?
I don't know.

2148
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:38,383
You think people shouldn't be able to 
get married just because there are two 

2149
01:41:40,061 --> 01:41:44,110
men or two women that's intolerable in 
2015.

2150
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:44,973
That's Archaic Shit and I think that is 
one of the archaic things that's going 

2151
01:41:48,411 --> 01:41:51,220
to slowly but surely start vanishing 
from our world.

2152
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:53,410
It's not.
Maybe not now.

2153
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,750
There's still a lot of homophobia now,
but you know,

2154
01:41:55,751 --> 01:41:59,230
there's this woman from Brazil who's a,
did an interview,

2155
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,360
um,
think it was Jessica on Drudge,

2156
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:02,643
a MMA fighter,
and she was talking about how many 

2157
01:42:05,111 --> 01:42:08,950
people in Brazil are homophobic in 
comparison to United States.

2158
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:10,053
And she's like,
it's really nice to see the United 

2159
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:14,680
States doing this and hopefully more 
people in Brazil think this way too.

2160
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:17,710
And he realized that a lot of Latin 
American countries,

2161
01:42:17,711 --> 01:42:19,900
especially like you were talking about 
Cuba,

2162
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:22,330
you were talking to me the other night 
about Cuba.

2163
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,060
Russia chill.
Yeah.

2164
01:42:24,090 --> 01:42:26,290
Yeah.
Actually pass laws.

2165
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:28,450
They passed laws against gay people.
Listen man,

2166
01:42:28,451 --> 01:42:29,360
this is,
uh,

2167
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:33,760
something completely new to some people.
It doesn't affect me.

2168
01:42:34,150 --> 01:42:36,090
So it doesn't bother me.
I know.

2169
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:37,033
Like I said it,
my joke on stage I lived next to 

2170
01:42:38,621 --> 01:42:41,150
transgender is across the street.
Great.

2171
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:43,690
But the gay girl with the dog,
I talked to him every bag,

2172
01:42:43,691 --> 01:42:47,290
goof around.
I go on fucking big Mike and Leslie,

2173
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:48,493
you know,
I love him.

2174
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,350
I don't give a fuck,
you know,

2175
01:42:50,351 --> 01:42:53,620
but there's some people were still 
living in 19 fucking 17 man.

2176
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:54,513
Yeah.
And those people are stuck in their own 

2177
01:42:55,841 --> 01:42:57,460
fucking lunch.
So I just keep walking,

2178
01:42:58,310 --> 01:42:59,710
just keep walking.
What are you going to do?

2179
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:01,450
And everyday they watched the longest 
yard,

2180
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:05,320
long for the days when you could smash a
chick's face against the wall.

2181
01:43:05,410 --> 01:43:10,410
I was explained to you the other day 
that the most foremost community in Cuba

2182
01:43:10,691 --> 01:43:11,860
is the gay community.

2183
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:14,560
I grew up with gay Cubans around me,
my mom,

2184
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:16,730
my mom at the fucking bar.
What do you think?

2185
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:19,750
Buckle keeps the lights on.
White dudes in the daytime.

2186
01:43:19,751 --> 01:43:21,520
Those gay fucks that come in and spend 
it,

2187
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:23,930
you know.
And in those days that were doing blow,

2188
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:25,930
that was selling blow and I grew up 
around them.

2189
01:43:25,931 --> 01:43:27,640
I never had any hatred or anything for 
them.

2190
01:43:28,450 --> 01:43:32,200
But my stepfather,
he used from the other side of the cube.

2191
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,560
Okay.
Where they can't be in a room with a gay

2192
01:43:35,561 --> 01:43:36,580
guy,
no hatred,

2193
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,033
no whatever,
but they just can't be in the room that 

2194
01:43:39,821 --> 01:43:42,730
manhood and not be in a room with a gay 
guy.

2195
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:44,830
You know?
And I get it.

2196
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,233
Some Latin American countries is just.
But who are the biggest gay guys in the 

2197
01:43:48,851 --> 01:43:50,620
world?
Fucking Lens.

2198
01:43:50,770 --> 01:43:52,160
They're the ones.
So

2199
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,930
what do you think that is?
Do you think it's the whole thing?

2200
01:43:55,150 --> 01:43:56,660
What?
What is it like in Sicily?

2201
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:59,150
On that island?
What would it be like in 1950?

2202
01:43:59,151 --> 01:44:01,550
The big gains.
Sicily to bang each other a lot.

2203
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:04,130
I don't think so.
I don't fucking think so.

2204
01:44:04,131 --> 01:44:07,340
I think that's where the Catholics are,
but I think that you'd be.

2205
01:44:07,970 --> 01:44:10,520
I think that you would be fucking 
totally against it.

2206
01:44:10,830 --> 01:44:13,340
I think northern Italy,
those hardheaded motherfuckers,

2207
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:14,493
you can't tell those motherfuckers yo 
friend or whatever the fuck they call 

2208
01:44:17,151 --> 01:44:17,721
them.
Right.

2209
01:44:17,721 --> 01:44:21,140
But that's also where the Vatican is 
like how ironic is that?

2210
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:25,450
That doesn't make any sense because that
is the biggest gay sex organization.

2211
01:44:25,470 --> 01:44:27,500
But they don't want to know that they're
going to be one sale.

2212
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:28,810
That pedophilia.
Okay.

2213
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:30,560
The biggest pedal.
Nobody wants to know that.

2214
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:33,230
Do they preach fuck each other or they 
only fuck kids?

2215
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:35,000
How does that work?
Who knows?

2216
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,660
You've got to bring me down with that 
book now and Shit.

2217
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:42,160
But I'm just curious.
I didn't,

2218
01:44:42,161 --> 01:44:42,994
I didn't,
you know,

2219
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:44,053
I,
I just know how it was when I was 

2220
01:44:46,341 --> 01:44:47,174
growing up.
I know the Vatican owned the gay 

2221
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:49,520
bathhouse.
No,

2222
01:44:49,730 --> 01:44:53,660
the building the Vatican owns was home 
to the biggest gay bathhouse in Italy.

2223
01:44:55,340 --> 01:45:00,340
That's crazy.
We should go play some synthetic heroin.

2224
01:45:01,970 --> 01:45:02,571
Yeah,
let me,

2225
01:45:02,571 --> 01:45:04,620
I'll pull up the story because it's 
fucking ridiculous game.

2226
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:07,160
Jamie Polish it up,
put it up on the big screen.

2227
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:08,630
It's ridiculous.
They own their mean.

2228
01:45:08,631 --> 01:45:10,970
There's so blatant.
They've been doing this for so long,

2229
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:12,410
you know,
like this,

2230
01:45:12,411 --> 01:45:16,160
this gigantic crazy cult that's running 
the Catholic empire.

2231
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:17,143
They've been in charge for so long,
wearing wizard costumes and sitting on 

2232
01:45:20,361 --> 01:45:21,194
thrones and people.
So many people have bought into it that 

2233
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:26,123
look at this,
the Vatican pays the landlord to 

2234
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:29,660
Europe's biggest gay bath house,
and by the way I say this,

2235
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:31,370
I went to Catholic school.

2236
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:36,760
I'm allowed to say this shit.
Three landlord to.

2237
01:45:38,030 --> 01:45:40,670
They play landlord,
the Europe's biggest gay bath house.

2238
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:41,893
The church paid $30,000,000
to acquire a building that houses a 

2239
01:45:44,601 --> 01:45:49,601
senior cardinal and a huge gay sauna.
Wait a fucking minute.

2240
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:54,020
They have a senior cardinal and a huge 
gay sauna.

2241
01:45:54,021 --> 01:45:56,390
That's it.
That's his own private gay bath house.

2242
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:59,000
The guy owns a bathhouse.
They paid 30 million.

2243
01:45:59,150 --> 01:45:59,983
First of all,
how crazy is it that the Vatican has 30 

2244
01:46:01,710 --> 01:46:04,580
billion bucks to buy houses with like 
they have so much money?

2245
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:06,710
Look at that.
The 75 year old printer,

2246
01:46:06,711 --> 01:46:07,544
that church enjoys a 12 room apartment 
on the first floor of the imposing 

2247
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:12,704
Palazzo at two via cod Duci just yards 
from the ground floor entrance to the 

2248
01:46:17,701 --> 01:46:19,550
steamy flesh pot.
He's.

2249
01:46:19,730 --> 01:46:21,680
He's above it,
smelling it.

2250
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:25,250
There are 18 other Vatican apartments in
the block.

2251
01:46:25,251 --> 01:46:27,410
Many of wind,
which house priests,

2252
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:28,603
Cardinal Ds,
who is seen as a social conservative 

2253
01:46:31,131 --> 01:46:33,410
even by current standards of the church 
hierarchy,

2254
01:46:33,411 --> 01:46:37,880
is no doubt horrified to learn of the 
activities taking place a floor below.

2255
01:46:38,330 --> 01:46:42,710
My goodness,
I could not imagine it's apartment.

2256
01:46:42,711 --> 01:46:45,530
Mildly,
smells like buttholes mildly.

2257
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:49,200
It's probably a tornado and it's 
probably a black man.

2258
01:46:49,201 --> 01:46:50,160
One of those fucking car,

2259
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:51,053
those trees hanging over your rear view.
That's a weekly bed light feature in 

2260
01:46:56,731 --> 01:46:57,564
Bruno,
very overweight past two assaults who 

2261
01:47:00,031 --> 01:47:00,864
dresses in the Catholic vestments 
naturally is free to the music of his 

2262
01:47:04,141 --> 01:47:07,530
clergyman remaining in a funk because I 
got to do that.

2263
01:47:07,531 --> 01:47:08,700
I'm going to be the new blue.
No,

2264
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:11,100
fuck it.
I'm going to slay some big.

2265
01:47:11,101 --> 01:47:15,540
Where the fuck he wants to expose body 
and soul according to the Independent.

2266
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:16,643
Barry Knight also features a buffet 
because exposing one's body and soul 

2267
01:47:20,431 --> 01:47:23,100
works up in appetite.
This is a hilarious article.

2268
01:47:23,150 --> 01:47:24,420
Isn't salon?
This article?

2269
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:26,670
Who wrote this article?
It's very funny.

2270
01:47:26,730 --> 01:47:28,860
You know Joe Rogan?
You read Katie Mcdonough.

2271
01:47:29,210 --> 01:47:30,043
You're really funny.
After you go to Catholic school and 

2272
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:33,260
you're raised Catholic,
it's fucking.

2273
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:35,693
It's fucking mind by like.
It's just like firecrackers when all 

2274
01:47:38,190 --> 01:47:41,910
figurehead.
For some people it's like cosby was dope

2275
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,850
bitches.
It was mind boggling from.

2276
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:45,750
They grew up on cosby.
You said,

2277
01:47:45,810 --> 01:47:46,643
look at this fucking Jarrod guy.
Look at this fucking Jarret guy 

2278
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:52,920
somewhere.
The kids at the FBI,

2279
01:47:52,921 --> 01:47:54,390
you know,
I hope this isn't true,

2280
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:58,080
but they arrested one guy like in the 
organization,

2281
01:47:58,081 --> 01:47:58,914
right?
Did they just investigate jared or did 

2282
01:47:59,871 --> 01:48:02,720
they have a suspicion?
It's his house.

2283
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:03,563
I'm being investigated.
It just goodness separated his business 

2284
01:48:06,451 --> 01:48:07,261
ties with subway.
Right?

2285
01:48:07,261 --> 01:48:08,820
He's got one of those little.
Well wait,

2286
01:48:08,821 --> 01:48:11,160
I didn't hear about this.
What happened to the subway guy?

2287
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:14,490
Child porn investigation.
Yeah,

2288
01:48:14,491 --> 01:48:15,570
man.
What the hell?

2289
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:16,533
Losing weight on keeps people all got a 
creepy fucking freak and it comes out 

2290
01:48:21,511 --> 01:48:22,344
eventually.
Just let it out before the fucking gets 

2291
01:48:24,811 --> 01:48:26,310
out.
Just let it.

2292
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,740
I love the little boys and fucking 
bikini.

2293
01:48:29,690 --> 01:48:31,650
You know,
eating a subway sandwich.

2294
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:33,150
Oh my God.
I sit there.

2295
01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:34,043
So do you think that like maybe he sent 
it to jared and jared kept his mouth 

2296
01:48:36,751 --> 01:48:36,990
shut.

2297
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:38,700
Do you think jared was sending shit 
back?

2298
01:48:38,910 --> 01:48:39,743
What do we.
TMZ is that asked me if you didn't have 

2299
01:48:47,071 --> 01:48:49,020
a life.
If you didn't have a life,

2300
01:48:49,021 --> 01:48:50,850
you want to,
you want to yell.

2301
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:51,743
You know,
when I first started hearing this shit 

2302
01:48:52,441 --> 01:48:55,320
about the Catholic church,
I ignored it.

2303
01:48:55,321 --> 01:48:56,550
I was like,
this is crazy.

2304
01:48:56,551 --> 01:48:57,720
I've been.
I was a fucking.

2305
01:48:58,140 --> 01:48:58,973
I was one of those kids,
those kids that fucking help the priest 

2306
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:04,333
for a body six months.
I did that shit until I got thrown out 

2307
01:49:07,501 --> 01:49:08,334
of that.
You know,

2308
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:10,080
I,
I believe,

2309
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:11,670
you know,
I gotta tell you man,

2310
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:15,210
like when I get,
I get dark dot sometimes I'm about to go

2311
01:49:15,211 --> 01:49:16,044
to sleep.
I just get dark fucking thoughts and 

2312
01:49:18,061 --> 01:49:18,894
just,
you know,

2313
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:21,360
just from being around Buddhist in 
Boulder,

2314
01:49:21,361 --> 01:49:23,810
I learned that they chant a lot.
And in other words,

2315
01:49:23,811 --> 01:49:26,150
a chant is not any different than a 
prayer,

2316
01:49:26,890 --> 01:49:28,950
you know?
So sometimes I got a bad thought.

2317
01:49:28,951 --> 01:49:30,830
I'll say a fucking Lord's prayer,
man.

2318
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:32,340
I'm old school.
You know what I'm saying?

2319
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:36,890
So when I hear this shit,
it just does something to you just like.

2320
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:39,960
But it's for some people it's like 
getting punched in the stomach.

2321
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:42,790
You trusted somebody.
It's like having a babysitter.

2322
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:45,420
That Melissa Kitty,
you're numb for a week.

2323
01:49:45,421 --> 01:49:46,980
Man,
you're really you.

2324
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:47,980
But this is our

2325
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:48,813
whole fucking society.
Every three days we get dropped with 

2326
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:52,720
some that we go,
what the fuck?

2327
01:49:52,721 --> 01:49:55,480
How did this happen?
How did this fucking happen?

2328
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:58,570
Yeah.
When things like this happen,

2329
01:49:58,620 --> 01:49:59,453
you always got to wonder like what sets 
something like that off in someone's 

2330
01:50:03,011 --> 01:50:04,630
brain?
Are they born with that?

2331
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:06,910
Does it happen because someone does it 
to them?

2332
01:50:07,390 --> 01:50:09,460
Does.
Is it a chemical imbalance?

2333
01:50:09,461 --> 01:50:13,420
Like what the fuck is it that makes 
someone sexually attracted to kids?

2334
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:17,300
What a bizarre thing to exist in nature.
You know the.

2335
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:20,170
I mean,
it's almost like a suicide gene.

2336
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:24,460
It's almost like,
like you like in having that,

2337
01:50:24,461 --> 01:50:26,230
like your,
your body is so weak,

2338
01:50:26,231 --> 01:50:28,750
your mind is so weak.
Everything is so off kilter.

2339
01:50:28,910 --> 01:50:29,743
You're trying to get yourself killed and
there's no better way to get yourself 

2340
01:50:31,601 --> 01:50:33,520
killed in fucking someone's kids.
Like,

2341
01:50:33,570 --> 01:50:34,540
do you know any people?

2342
01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:37,710
You remember that video where the guy's 
walking through the airport and uh,

2343
01:50:37,780 --> 01:50:38,613
he had molested.
He was a karate instructor and he had 

2344
01:50:40,031 --> 01:50:42,520
molested some kids and this guy's a,
this.

2345
01:50:42,521 --> 01:50:46,690
One of the kid's dads waited for him in 
the airport and as he walked by with the

2346
01:50:46,691 --> 01:50:48,100
cops,
walks up to his head,

2347
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:49,810
boom,
blows his brains out,

2348
01:50:49,811 --> 01:50:51,400
just drops the gun on the ground.
In fact,

2349
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:52,860
I got off by the way.
Did it?

2350
01:50:52,930 --> 01:50:53,680
Yeah,
you got it off.

2351
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:55,570
You got to get off.
That's a great defense.

2352
01:50:55,571 --> 01:50:57,910
You lost your mind.
They abuse your child.

2353
01:50:58,140 --> 01:50:58,973
Yeah.
He got off.

2354
01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:00,011
Yeah.
He,

2355
01:51:00,011 --> 01:51:00,940
uh,
he didn't do any time.

2356
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:02,013
He shot that guy right in the fucking 
head in front of cops and then drop the 

2357
01:51:03,821 --> 01:51:04,860
gun.
What state was that?

2358
01:51:05,050 --> 01:51:05,883
I don't remember.
I want to say it was in New York and 

2359
01:51:07,551 --> 01:51:09,340
once it was in New York,
I forget.

2360
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:11,140
It might not have been though.
It might've been somewhere else.

2361
01:51:11,141 --> 01:51:14,360
Just some things that if you get there 
before the cops you would.

2362
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:17,740
Yeah.
That's before the cops.

2363
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:21,610
You fucking win this guy shot them in 
front of the cops.

2364
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:25,680
Lost my mind temporarily.
Temporarily and sand.

2365
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:29,250
And the cops like fucking handcuffs from
going that a boy.

2366
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:31,450
This is it right here.
Father shoots son.

2367
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:35,620
Father shoots and kills a son's 
kidnapper an airport.

2368
01:51:35,621 --> 01:51:37,960
Refer revenge.
So wait,

2369
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,800
they're going to show him shit.
Oh yeah.

2370
01:51:39,810 --> 01:51:41,010
Oh No.
Yeah,

2371
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:44,570
no.
He was just a.

2372
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:47,880
He just couldn't take it man.
He got this guy away.

2373
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:49,120
Look at this.
Boom.

2374
01:51:51,330 --> 01:51:56,330
And then he puts the gun away and then 
he had a crazy hat on the cops hold them

2375
01:51:56,371 --> 01:51:57,204
down.

2376
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:00,580
It was his son.
Man.

2377
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,110
That's so good.
I mean,

2378
01:52:02,111 --> 01:52:03,820
it is right.
It's fucked up.

2379
01:52:03,821 --> 01:52:04,690
But it is.
I mean,

2380
01:52:04,691 --> 01:52:08,080
I'm not usually for this kind of shit,
but boom.

2381
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:13,340
I mean that is about as.
I mean as far as like,

2382
01:52:14,830 --> 01:52:16,630
what's fair.
I'm for it.

2383
01:52:17,450 --> 01:52:18,640
I'm not against that.
You know,

2384
01:52:18,641 --> 01:52:21,190
you've been my friend for a long time.
I have a horrible,

2385
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:24,880
horrible event.
It's in my blood.

2386
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,260
You know,
you do.

2387
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:27,153
When they went down to Cuba and they 
tell the fucking Maya Lansky that they 

2388
01:52:31,601 --> 01:52:33,820
tell the Jew that fucking they soul 
rebels.

2389
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,290
What does he say?
He goes,

2390
01:52:35,291 --> 01:52:37,720
these motherfuckers savages all their 
lives.

2391
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:39,253
They've been savages.
They always been savaged dog revenge 

2392
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,410
Jane.
And it's horrible.

2393
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:46,150
And no

2394
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,320
cop would stop me.
You're crazy.

2395
01:52:48,321 --> 01:52:51,020
I wish I would have hit somebody with a 
car and go to the same jail.

2396
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:54,500
I'm one of those motherfuckers like,
once I have it in my mind,

2397
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:57,240
you're done.
It's in my blood.

2398
01:52:57,310 --> 01:53:00,530
That's what my whole life and movies,
outlaw Josey Wales,

2399
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:05,590
that Jewish man on fire,
man on fire out there,

2400
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:06,433
how bad he is,
which I missed that scene until a month 

2401
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:09,283
ago.
He talks that dude into shoot 

2402
01:53:10,281 --> 01:53:11,114
themselves.
There's only two motherfuckers in the 

2403
01:53:12,831 --> 01:53:14,930
movies that have done that.
Uh,

2404
01:53:15,230 --> 01:53:17,660
what's his name?
And my boy in silence of the lambs.

2405
01:53:17,661 --> 01:53:20,360
He talked to them motherfucking to hang 
himself from the other cell.

2406
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:21,773
That's right.
I remember a man because he talked me 

2407
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:26,690
into fucking swallow on his own fucking 
thumb.

2408
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:29,240
Merrick's was the guy who said throw ges
and people's face.

2409
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:30,673
My friend Jon Tobin,
you should call me migs selling high 

2410
01:53:40,521 --> 01:53:41,354
plains drifter was um,
that was when he was painting the town 

2411
01:53:44,571 --> 01:53:45,020
red.

2412
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:47,150
That was the one where they killed him 
and he came back.

2413
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:51,920
He came back and they put the shield on 
so crazy Monday shooting the body and he

2414
01:53:51,921 --> 01:53:52,754
kept going down.
They thought he was a ghost when he was 

2415
01:53:54,610 --> 01:53:57,020
a ghost,
a beat the to death with a whip.

2416
01:53:57,230 --> 01:54:02,230
And then he came back as Clint Eastwood.
He came back to boast and fuck that town

2417
01:54:02,361 --> 01:54:04,310
up.
It was a great movie.

2418
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:05,413
That was a great movie at the time.
I remember seeing the first time I saw 

2419
01:54:07,911 --> 01:54:08,960
high plains drifter,
I was like,

2420
01:54:08,961 --> 01:54:09,870
Holy Shit.
Yeah,

2421
01:54:09,871 --> 01:54:10,704
that was dope you had to throw.
That's what I'm talking about when you 

2422
01:54:12,651 --> 01:54:13,484
see the machismo and burt reynolds.
It's because that motherfucker just 

2423
01:54:16,731 --> 01:54:18,380
watched bullet and he goes,
wait a second.

2424
01:54:18,490 --> 01:54:20,630
Yeah,
I got out that motherfucker,

2425
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:23,660
you know,
I got to put on this corduroy suit.

2426
01:54:25,420 --> 01:54:29,090
And then Charles Bronson came along and 
he's got to outdo everybody because he's

2427
01:54:29,091 --> 01:54:29,924
ugly.

2428
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:33,350
You know,
he was the baddest motherfucker ever.

2429
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:36,660
If I'm going to watch a movie from that 
era and uh,

2430
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:39,110
like if I come home,
like say if I go to a hotel room,

2431
01:54:39,590 --> 01:54:40,070
hey,
you know,

2432
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:40,903
you're bored.
You're like,

2433
01:54:41,030 --> 01:54:43,670
what's on TV?
And you turn it on and you get this,

2434
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:45,110
you get excited.
You Go,

2435
01:54:45,111 --> 01:54:47,230
Oh shit.
You know,

2436
01:54:47,231 --> 01:54:51,350
you thought you're just going to be by 
yourself watching some terrible movie.

2437
01:54:51,410 --> 01:54:54,410
And it turns out high plains drifters on
hbo or something like,

2438
01:54:54,411 --> 01:54:55,244
Fuck,
they don't even really show these on 

2439
01:54:56,241 --> 01:54:58,220
Hbo.
Why?

2440
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:00,500
Why can't they?
They have to show new shit all the time,

2441
01:55:00,501 --> 01:55:02,270
right?
There's a channel.

2442
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:06,140
About a month ago,
they showed a not high plains drifter,

2443
01:55:06,141 --> 01:55:08,540
but the other one,
but you wanted with no commercials,

2444
01:55:08,541 --> 01:55:09,770
man.
That's the way you want.

2445
01:55:09,771 --> 01:55:13,220
You don't want these fucking things on 
regular tv to watch these movies.

2446
01:55:13,221 --> 01:55:14,240
Joe Rogan.
Why?

2447
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:19,050
Because it makes me fucking crazy.
These movies,

2448
01:55:19,051 --> 01:55:20,990
you find your why.
You're an American pro.

2449
01:55:21,830 --> 01:55:23,540
These movies where they made them in 
Italy.

2450
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:26,870
What we talking about when we came in,
it's time to put a strap.

2451
01:55:26,890 --> 01:55:30,040
It wouldn't live in this fucked up times
and you really.

2452
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:31,940
You're.
You're anxious about this.

2453
01:55:31,941 --> 01:55:36,230
Lately I've got a wife and a kid that I 
worry about and I don't know what I do.

2454
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:38,660
I shoot the whole fight.
Be John Wick.

2455
01:55:38,661 --> 01:55:42,470
I told you I got to get one of those 
gentleman wake during you that John Wick

2456
01:55:42,471 --> 01:55:44,130
the first 20 minutes or until he hooks

2457
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:46,460
up with the check.
Once you've done put the checks.

2458
01:55:46,461 --> 01:55:47,294
That bothers me for awhile,
but then you click it down with 45 

2459
01:55:49,591 --> 01:55:50,424
minutes left.
That is one of the best kick ass scenes 

2460
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:57,180
since Bruce Lee and enter the dragon.
You better check your watches.

2461
01:55:57,181 --> 01:55:59,310
That's 30 fucking years.
He cleans out.

2462
01:55:59,490 --> 01:56:04,350
He's using bullets as strikes and he's 
shooting them up close and blowing their

2463
01:56:04,351 --> 01:56:07,530
fucking heads up is a bad ass.
And when you see that movie,

2464
01:56:07,531 --> 01:56:08,980
you know he trained with Keegan and 
laugh.

2465
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:14,240
He can fucking fuck them.
I'm anxious to go see him tomorrow to go

2466
01:56:14,521 --> 01:56:14,970
see.
Yeah.

2467
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:17,910
Like on the way home,
I called my brother,

2468
01:56:17,911 --> 01:56:20,130
you're going to teach tomorrow.
I be there at 11:00.

2469
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:21,510
That's it.
That's always say to each other.

2470
01:56:21,511 --> 01:56:22,344
I see 11:00.
He comes with an Indian Dude and heals 

2471
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:28,620
your body guy lasered down all by 
energy.

2472
01:56:28,621 --> 01:56:30,660
Guy Looks at you and goes,
you show the Bob and you're like,

2473
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:31,760
God damn it.

2474
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:32,603
You know,
every week it's like a game of chess 

2475
01:56:33,361 --> 01:56:35,400
with them really?
And he lays it down.

2476
01:56:35,401 --> 01:56:38,520
He does his Cherokee shit show that kind
of India.

2477
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:42,200
He picks up the arm.
He touched a Cherokee thing.

2478
01:56:43,490 --> 01:56:48,490
He releases the Eagle,
got to it from your bud.

2479
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:51,840
You Got to see the upload k and after 
the Eagle is.

2480
01:56:52,770 --> 01:56:53,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

2481
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:54,390
He shows.
Put an Indian.

2482
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:59,810
He fucking wants nothing.
Nothing to guys and old rodeo clown dog.

2483
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:03,380
He broke every bone in his body.
Oh my God.

2484
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:07,420
So this guy adjusted a roofing and he 
was like dog last week.

2485
01:57:07,421 --> 01:57:09,010
Some to do with them.
Met with a fucked up at.

2486
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:12,930
The guy was there this weekend.
Clone fucking psychic Rodeo clown.

2487
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:14,063
She's crushed the most thankless job.
It might be one of the most thankless 

2488
01:57:18,331 --> 01:57:19,440
jobs ever.
Nobody gives up.

2489
01:57:19,470 --> 01:57:20,303
There's no.
Not One Lance Armstrong or the Rodeo 

2490
01:57:21,961 --> 01:57:23,340
clowns.
You know what I mean?

2491
01:57:23,610 --> 01:57:26,100
It's like Ken Block.
It was like a famous driver,

2492
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:29,100
right?
There's like a skateboarder's Tony Hawk.

2493
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:31,290
You know,
there's one guy in each discipline.

2494
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:32,790
Tiger Woods.
You know what I mean?

2495
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:36,330
Everybody knows tiger woods is a golfer 
who's the one rodeo clown.

2496
01:57:36,331 --> 01:57:38,490
Name one.
They get no respect.

2497
01:57:38,491 --> 01:57:40,290
It's probably one person that we've just
done now.

2498
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:42,480
It's like a Mexican superhero or 
something like that.

2499
01:57:42,690 --> 01:57:43,523
They don't really use rodeo clowns.
They have a mean in bullfighting mean 

2500
01:57:47,070 --> 01:57:47,903
this like bull riding.
I'm pretty sure is an American 

2501
01:57:50,791 --> 01:57:52,080
tradition,
is it?

2502
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:53,880
I think so.
I think,

2503
01:57:53,881 --> 01:57:54,714
uh,
in Mexico obviously they have a lot of 

2504
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:57,720
bullfighting in Spain,
Spain,

2505
01:57:57,721 --> 01:57:59,880
they have a lot of bull fighting.
I guess that's where they got it from,

2506
01:57:59,881 --> 01:58:01,890
right?
They imported from Spain.

2507
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:05,860
I'm open because that's what Mexican 
Mexico is.

2508
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:10,880
It's like the indigenous Americans that 
came over when the Spanish came over,

2509
01:58:11,510 --> 01:58:13,590
they taught them Spanish and started 
fucking them.

2510
01:58:14,010 --> 01:58:16,200
And that's a main Mexican.
That's why I get like Mexicans,

2511
01:58:16,201 --> 01:58:18,270
like Oscar de la Hoya,
you know,

2512
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:20,430
who's like this beautiful looking,
you know,

2513
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:24,030
European looking man,
like kind of fairly pale skin.

2514
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:26,340
And then you'll get a Mexican,
like,

2515
01:58:26,341 --> 01:58:27,174
you know,
Juan Manwell Marquez was like much more 

2516
01:58:29,221 --> 01:58:31,410
Mexican looking.
Inca Inca,

2517
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:35,110
the darker skin and like the,
you know,

2518
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:37,350
darker hair.
It's interesting,

2519
01:58:37,351 --> 01:58:38,190
man.
This is a,

2520
01:58:38,191 --> 01:58:40,890
the whole North American continent is 
fucking fascinating.

2521
01:58:41,290 --> 01:58:44,800
It's fascinating to think that if you 
came to this spot 400 years ago,

2522
01:58:44,801 --> 01:58:46,600
there'd be very few people here.
Very,

2523
01:58:46,601 --> 01:58:47,470
very,
very few.

2524
01:58:47,530 --> 01:58:50,470
A few nomadic tribes of native 
Americans.

2525
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:52,210
No cities,
no nothing.

2526
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:53,530
Oh,
you think,

2527
01:58:53,530 --> 01:58:57,790
how interesting is this?
There was a ds on the boat with Columbus

2528
01:58:57,830 --> 01:59:02,410
under Valdez,
really Diaz on the boat with all the has

2529
01:59:02,411 --> 01:59:03,820
come from.
I didn't say that.

2530
01:59:04,350 --> 01:59:05,183
I didn't say Tetra Dad and they spell it
with a z and then one of the biggest 

2531
01:59:11,621 --> 01:59:16,450
lieutenants in Sicilian history is the 
as with a seat and then we just saw that

2532
01:59:16,451 --> 01:59:17,080
priests within.

2533
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:19,390
That's a dance with a C,
Z,

2534
01:59:19,770 --> 01:59:20,680
Z,
Z,

2535
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:22,083
and then you have the fucking lunatics 
up in Stockman and then Mexican and I'm 

2536
01:59:27,731 --> 01:59:29,860
sitting here in front of you and I'm 
Cuba as can be.

2537
01:59:30,460 --> 01:59:31,293
That makes you think like the as the as 
the and the as as a lieutenant and Diaz 

2538
01:59:36,611 --> 01:59:40,330
was on the ship as an Italian Talon,
ds,

2539
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:43,390
Italian as an Italian.
Valdez with Z.

2540
01:59:44,350 --> 01:59:49,350
my mother's side of the family's Valdez 
and the darker than that and my father's

2541
01:59:50,321 --> 01:59:53,710
side is diaz from come away and they 
came from Spain.

2542
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:58,340
They speak,
but the thing that I've either faith,

2543
01:59:58,610 --> 02:00:00,790
they speak like Jaguar was like those 
people.

2544
02:00:01,450 --> 02:00:04,570
So you have to think how to be as get 
the Mexico.

2545
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:08,950
How did this diaz get here and how the 
Diaz with a z,

2546
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:10,930
the Diaz would.
That's.

2547
02:00:11,290 --> 02:00:13,810
These are all very interesting things 
that I look at.

2548
02:00:13,990 --> 02:00:14,823
You look at evolution.
We were talking about how they found 

2549
02:00:16,601 --> 02:00:19,120
that fucking pull up the whale in 
Wyoming,

2550
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:22,600
but years ago we have no discussion on 
the podcast.

2551
02:00:22,601 --> 02:00:23,434
You know,
this is things that have always baffled 

2552
02:00:25,181 --> 02:00:26,014
me.
Like how come there's Nate Diaz and his 

2553
02:00:27,701 --> 02:00:31,390
brother that Mexicans are not income 
Mexicans too though,

2554
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:33,460
right there,
the other Mexicans.

2555
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:36,130
It came from somewhere else and he 
robbed whatever.

2556
02:00:36,131 --> 02:00:38,350
So it's very interesting.
You know,

2557
02:00:38,351 --> 02:00:39,860
what's interesting to me,
I'm.

2558
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:40,933
One of the things that's been getting me
lately is this water situation in 

2559
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:45,760
California.
It's pretty bad.

2560
02:00:46,090 --> 02:00:48,550
It's a three years going on four years 
now.

2561
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:50,890
And uh,
the drought is pretty ferocious.

2562
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:52,150
Like they're,
um,

2563
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:57,180
they're saying that California was used 
29 percent less water last month.

2564
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:59,200
So people are working to try to solve 
it.

2565
02:00:59,201 --> 02:01:00,034
But what was occurring to me when I was 
thinking about this as we know for a 

2566
02:01:03,281 --> 02:01:04,114
fact that there's areas of the world 
that used to be lush and then they 

2567
02:01:07,571 --> 02:01:08,404
became desert,
like that's a that we know for a fact 

2568
02:01:10,481 --> 02:01:13,420
about the Nile Valley,
like in Egypt where the pyramids used to

2569
02:01:13,421 --> 02:01:16,870
be where the where the pyramids are.
Rather before that 9,000

2570
02:01:16,871 --> 02:01:17,704
years ago,
they know there was like a rain forest 

2571
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:19,534
there and slowly over time shit just 
changed and then there's not that much 

2572
02:01:23,321 --> 02:01:25,870
rainfall and that could easily happen to
California.

2573
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:26,913
But would we stay with everybody stay 
here when they just keep pumping water 

2574
02:01:29,981 --> 02:01:32,380
artificially into this spot or when 
people go,

2575
02:01:32,381 --> 02:01:34,600
you know what?
This ain't working the same word.

2576
02:01:34,601 --> 02:01:36,640
We know how many fucking we got to move 
on.

2577
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:39,320
Like we've always had to all throughout 
human history.

2578
02:01:39,470 --> 02:01:40,280
Whenever the climate

2579
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:41,990
got bad people to get the fuck out of 
there.

2580
02:01:42,110 --> 02:01:45,230
When the ice age was happening here,
no one was living in Canada.

2581
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:46,183
No one was living in Canada during the 
ice age because it was two miles thick 

2582
02:01:49,731 --> 02:01:51,830
of ice and a lot of spots.
You wouldn't,

2583
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:53,510
you weren't,
you weren't living on ice,

2584
02:01:53,860 --> 02:01:54,693
you're right,
you would find a way to get to a place 

2585
02:01:56,391 --> 02:01:57,740
where it's not ice,
you know,

2586
02:01:57,741 --> 02:01:58,574
but all the places that were covered in 
ice where there was a massive amount of 

2587
02:02:00,441 --> 02:02:02,990
Canada,
so all when all that ice receded,

2588
02:02:02,991 --> 02:02:04,190
that's where we got the Great Lakes 
from.

2589
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:08,330
The Great Lakes are fucking puddles that
are melted glaciers.

2590
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:09,283
I mean,
that's how fucking crazy this place was 

2591
02:02:10,730 --> 02:02:12,140
just 10,000
years ago,

2592
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:13,273
if we had a house and it was there.
You can't be stubborn when the ice 

2593
02:02:16,281 --> 02:02:17,810
starts coming.
You can't say,

2594
02:02:17,811 --> 02:02:19,070
we're just going to keep chipping away 
at that.

2595
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:20,930
Over a year I get a certain point in 
time.

2596
02:02:20,931 --> 02:02:21,580
You've got to realize,
okay,

2597
02:02:21,580 --> 02:02:22,413
there's two miles of ice and it's as big
as fucking Canada or half a Canada or 

2598
02:02:27,230 --> 02:02:29,720
even a few states where those few states
are,

2599
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:32,060
you can't live.
You gotta get Outta there.

2600
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:35,210
You gotta get out of there.
And if that happens here,

2601
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:36,433
we're so arrogant.
Our idea that we can control nature is 

2602
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:42,140
so arrogant.
No one considers leaving California like

2603
02:02:42,141 --> 02:02:43,550
everybody talks about like,
well,

2604
02:02:43,551 --> 02:02:44,384
California is California.
We got to do something about the 

2605
02:02:45,501 --> 02:02:49,100
California water crisis with.
It never rains again because guess what?

2606
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:49,993
That could happen if it doesn't rain,
but once or twice a year or 10 times a 

2607
02:02:53,481 --> 02:02:54,314
year or 20 times a year,
there have been way crazier things than 

2608
02:02:58,281 --> 02:03:01,820
a shift in our climate.
To the point where it rains zero,

2609
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:04,640
that's totally possible.
It's totally possible.

2610
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:07,640
If it's possible to rain one day a year,
it's possible to rein zero.

2611
02:03:08,030 --> 02:03:10,130
If it's possible to rein 10,
it's possible to rain one,

2612
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:12,140
it's.
It can be horrific,

2613
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:13,453
disastrous.
It's totally possible and it would be 

2614
02:03:15,561 --> 02:03:16,394
normal.
It would be something that's happened 

2615
02:03:17,511 --> 02:03:18,344
all throughout the world.
They know that like a lot of deserts 

2616
02:03:20,751 --> 02:03:23,840
used to be like lush areas and then 
somehow or another,

2617
02:03:23,870 --> 02:03:28,360
like for whatever reason things changed.
Things shifted.

2618
02:03:28,630 --> 02:03:30,410
You know,
and you can blame people you want.

2619
02:03:30,411 --> 02:03:35,411
I'm sure we have a lot to do with it.
I'm sure global warming that there's,

2620
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:40,820
without a doubt as some element of human
civilization is a part of it is too many

2621
02:03:40,821 --> 02:03:44,210
scientists that believe it does.
There's gotta be some factor,

2622
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:47,480
but even without that factor,
it's super possible.

2623
02:03:47,481 --> 02:03:49,300
That shit would change on its own.
It's,

2624
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:50,420
it's,
it shifts.

2625
02:03:50,450 --> 02:03:53,280
We don't control when it rains,
it could fuckin shift.

2626
02:03:53,290 --> 02:03:56,660
It easily could shift and if you're in a
spot that sucks,

2627
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:57,673
you got to make a decision.
You have to figure out what the fuck 

2628
02:03:58,881 --> 02:04:00,770
you're going to do.
Good rains more in Phoenix.

2629
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:01,633
It rains here.

2630
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:03,550
Earrings in Phoenix a lot.
Actually.

2631
02:04:03,551 --> 02:04:06,190
I didn't know that in Ohio and in 
Houston.

2632
02:04:06,191 --> 02:04:08,210
Look at Galveston.
It's raining so much that,

2633
02:04:08,211 --> 02:04:12,140
that they're shit water everywhere and 
people are losing their sight because a,

2634
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:12,993
it's overfilled.
All the sewage and stuff that you 

2635
02:04:15,791 --> 02:04:17,370
haven't read about this site.
Yeah.

2636
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:17,870
This,
uh,

2637
02:04:17,870 --> 02:04:22,400
this girl lost her sight just from being
in the water because the,

2638
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:24,750
they tested the water is,
it's all shit water.

2639
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:25,893
It's in Galveston and Houston and 
they've had such bad flooding in the 

2640
02:04:30,010 --> 02:04:30,843
past month.
It's been horrible.

2641
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:31,793
Horrible.
God saw some of the photos back when we 

2642
02:04:35,711 --> 02:04:37,680
worked at a stone.
I was there.

2643
02:04:37,681 --> 02:04:37,990
They were

2644
02:04:37,990 --> 02:04:41,280
thinking about that Sunday floods been.
That was two months ago.

2645
02:04:41,370 --> 02:04:41,731
No,
no,

2646
02:04:41,731 --> 02:04:42,564
no.
The last stop on the way back in the 

2647
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:46,350
west time.
I have to remember when they closed that

2648
02:04:46,351 --> 02:04:47,340
hotel.
We used to stay up.

2649
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:48,181
Yeah,
they flooded.

2650
02:04:48,181 --> 02:04:50,890
That day was flooded up to the third 
floor.

2651
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:52,500
It was a time I was that.
I'm sorry.

2652
02:04:52,501 --> 02:04:57,501
The the comedy club was on West Grey 
going down west style fecal matter water

2653
02:05:00,541 --> 02:05:04,680
advisories.
Oh my God.

2654
02:05:05,580 --> 02:05:07,560
Let me read that whole thing.
Fecal matter.

2655
02:05:07,561 --> 02:05:10,950
Water advisories issued for some 
Galveston county beaches.

2656
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:14,130
Fucking a man.
Shit in the water.

2657
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:18,080
The girl who legal blindness.
Oh,

2658
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:24,420
that's insane.
Damn fucking subway already.

2659
02:05:24,421 --> 02:05:27,630
Cut ties with Jarrod came up.
At least the UFC.

2660
02:05:27,631 --> 02:05:29,920
Waited three days and shit with John 
Joseph.

2661
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:34,170
These motherfuckers,
they think Bain is tough.

2662
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:37,560
Fucking subway don't play.
They don't even give a fuck whether he's

2663
02:05:37,561 --> 02:05:39,390
guilty or not.
If even if he.

2664
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:42,420
If jared didn't do anything but knew 
about it,

2665
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:45,280
if he knew the dude had child,
porn is still response.

2666
02:05:45,281 --> 02:05:45,900
What do you hold them up

2667
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:50,010
was this is the article a woman loses 
sight in one eye after a mud run,

2668
02:05:50,190 --> 02:05:51,023
a young woman went blind in one eye 
within 24 hours after catching a flesh 

2669
02:05:54,390 --> 02:05:56,850
eating bacteria during the blood run in 
Dallas this month.

2670
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,710
Uh,
because of all the flooding.

2671
02:05:58,920 --> 02:06:03,580
Oh God.
How do you flush it?

2672
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:04,830
Just,
it says,

2673
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:05,723
a woman said that debrief cut her eye,
allowing flesh eating bacteria to 

2674
02:06:08,431 --> 02:06:12,390
destroy her cornea.
It just completely melted off my eye.

2675
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:12,650
Oh

2676
02:06:12,650 --> 02:06:15,650
my God.
Fuck.

2677
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:19,490
That's fucked up.
Do we just shit into the ocean?

2678
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:20,960
How does that work?
Oh Shit.

2679
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:23,780
More than a thousand runners get 
diarrhea after Monday.

2680
02:06:23,781 --> 02:06:26,990
Event,
of course,

2681
02:06:27,230 --> 02:06:28,790
while you're definitely getting some 
bacteria,

2682
02:06:28,791 --> 02:06:29,870
if you get a mouthful,
mud,

2683
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:32,120
that's 100 percent.
You're not supposed to do that.

2684
02:06:32,121 --> 02:06:32,954
By the way.
You're not supposed to drink still 

2685
02:06:34,251 --> 02:06:35,084
water.
You know you're lucky if that's all you 

2686
02:06:36,501 --> 02:06:38,360
get.
You know you can get something way worse

2687
02:06:38,361 --> 02:06:41,330
than that gentile shit jumping in a 
puddle of mud.

2688
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:42,173
Stale,
you're wiping me is you got to fucking 

2689
02:06:45,320 --> 02:06:46,153
jerk off.
At least the polar bears jump in the 

2690
02:06:47,891 --> 02:06:50,840
ocean.
They jump at the fucking cold water back

2691
02:06:50,870 --> 02:06:51,703
on the empathy.
You want to jump in mud after you 

2692
02:06:53,631 --> 02:06:56,900
fucking been running a Snellen,
whatever the fuck it been for a month.

2693
02:06:57,140 --> 02:06:57,973
God knows what's in that fucking mud.
I used to think of those polar bear 

2694
02:07:00,111 --> 02:07:00,944
people were idiots.

2695
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:02,510
Those people that would jump into the 
water.

2696
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:04,050
So you want it to freeze it.
Yeah.

2697
02:07:04,090 --> 02:07:04,970
And then you said,
God,

2698
02:07:04,971 --> 02:07:07,210
there aren't the something.
Ms Dot Johnson.

2699
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:09,750
The ocean managed cold and does 
something,

2700
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:12,710
especially when it hits like your bones 
for a minute.

2701
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:15,470
When you come out of that,
you feel like a fucking knew man.

2702
02:07:15,471 --> 02:07:18,380
I've jumped into the fuck of Atlantic.
Is that where we're at?

2703
02:07:18,520 --> 02:07:21,240
And which one's cold here?
It was cold.

2704
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:23,430
Oh my God.
When I used to jumping on board.

2705
02:07:23,450 --> 02:07:25,680
And Are we getting in Seattle?
That's fucking own.

2706
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:26,583
Whether that's freezing,
that's when you feel a bulge in your 

2707
02:07:28,761 --> 02:07:31,700
feet and shit,
but it's probably really good for you.

2708
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:34,250
Yeah,
it is because this cryotherapy shit.

2709
02:07:34,310 --> 02:07:36,340
This stuff is my fucking body.

2710
02:07:36,610 --> 02:07:40,870
It's changing the way my body feels.
It's amazing how well it like cures.

2711
02:07:40,871 --> 02:07:42,820
Any like weird shit.
That's bugging you.

2712
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:43,863
Inflammation back pains.
Back pains had been fucking with me 

2713
02:07:46,871 --> 02:07:48,190
forever.
They just dissolve it.

2714
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:49,393
You just do it all the time.
It's your body produces all these anti 

2715
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:55,060
inflammation responses to the cold 
weather,

2716
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:57,490
so that's probably what they were doing 
when they were jumping in the ocean.

2717
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:59,110
You get out of it and your body's like,

2718
02:08:01,070 --> 02:08:06,070
you just get this fucking charge.
When it gets hard real fast,

2719
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:10,900
the pop side of that motherfucker like 
yum.

2720
02:08:10,901 --> 02:08:13,420
Yum.
Has been served and Shit.

2721
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:16,900
I'll never forget you saying any ex 
girlfriends kill herself?

2722
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:17,763
No.
They showed a part of you suck my Dick 

2723
02:08:21,310 --> 02:08:22,990
in the eighties.
You should have killed yourself.

2724
02:08:23,950 --> 02:08:26,830
There's a girl on facebook that I 
thought I saw one night.

2725
02:08:27,430 --> 02:08:30,010
The last time I saw this check was the 
knife Faludi.

2726
02:08:30,670 --> 02:08:34,690
Doug flutie threw that touchdown.
This is winter of 83.

2727
02:08:34,691 --> 02:08:38,750
80 four maybe.
I saw at a bar dog this,

2728
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:40,580
this,
and they called a lorry.

2729
02:08:40,581 --> 02:08:42,430
The Jack.
That song.

2730
02:08:42,431 --> 02:08:43,670
That Jack?
No,

2731
02:08:43,870 --> 02:08:46,210
Jack by ACDC.
She's got the Jack.

2732
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:49,570
She's got the jacks.
Has something like a disease.

2733
02:08:50,070 --> 02:08:50,903
They didn't have the Jack.
She just didn't have a wet pussy so 

2734
02:08:53,291 --> 02:08:54,250
they,
cause no,

2735
02:08:54,490 --> 02:08:57,250
they call the fairview New Jersey 
because it was a dry hump.

2736
02:08:58,050 --> 02:08:58,883
These motherfuckers so sabic they will 
give you nicknames for everything is 

2737
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:03,303
Jersey,
you know,

2738
02:09:04,270 --> 02:09:05,680
and I saw her out,
man.

2739
02:09:05,681 --> 02:09:08,170
I don't know what the fuck have we 
started doing blow.

2740
02:09:08,650 --> 02:09:11,440
She was a babysitter for this family.
Louis Denato.

2741
02:09:11,441 --> 02:09:12,274
The guy was a freak.
We went over to their house and I saw 

2742
02:09:13,690 --> 02:09:18,690
the deposit bag from the bar and I 
robbed it and we got more blow and tower

2743
02:09:19,010 --> 02:09:21,190
room doing power and she's like,
guess what,

2744
02:09:21,191 --> 02:09:22,700
color my underwear.
I don't know if we get that.

2745
02:09:22,701 --> 02:09:24,570
She's like,
if you call it guest the Color Miranda,

2746
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:25,740
well let's,
I'll take a more.

2747
02:09:26,410 --> 02:09:28,510
I'm like read.
She's like a green but fuck it.

2748
02:09:28,511 --> 02:09:33,511
Take them off.
And I saw on facebook and I'm like,

2749
02:09:34,871 --> 02:09:36,040
do you remember what happened that 
night?

2750
02:09:36,041 --> 02:09:36,874
She's like,
no,

2751
02:09:37,510 --> 02:09:38,750
I go,
you don't want to fuck it.

2752
02:09:38,751 --> 02:09:41,530
No,
you wouldn't be here right now.

2753
02:09:41,650 --> 02:09:44,680
It'd be fucking killing yourself.
That's disgusting.

2754
02:09:44,740 --> 02:09:47,390
All that Shit's disgust.
Disgust.

2755
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:50,753
You know,
with all these transgender talk I was 

2756
02:09:52,091 --> 02:09:54,220
telling these motherfuckers on stays the
night that,

2757
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:55,613
uh,
that chick show this a pussy in Las 

2758
02:09:57,220 --> 02:09:58,300
Vegas.
There was a transgender.

2759
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:00,390
Do you remember what you called it?
What did I call it?

2760
02:10:01,410 --> 02:10:02,243
Open

2761
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:10,320
did,
it was tight and it looked like somebody

2762
02:10:10,321 --> 02:10:13,640
put a bomb in it with a decode was and 
clean with that.

2763
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:15,530
Remember when Doug and I were doing the 
man shown,

2764
02:10:15,550 --> 02:10:16,383
we had that really beautiful.
We had two of them that were really 

2765
02:10:18,881 --> 02:10:20,350
beautiful.
They were transgender.

2766
02:10:20,470 --> 02:10:24,070
You remember the one of them that was 
preop and she,

2767
02:10:24,071 --> 02:10:24,904
uh,
she showed his dick to the or her deck 

2768
02:10:25,901 --> 02:10:27,790
rather to the audience she showed his 
dick.

2769
02:10:27,791 --> 02:10:30,220
That's what I just said.
But it's hard to say her deck,

2770
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:31,383
you know what I'm saying?
Like I was treating her correctly by 

2771
02:10:33,471 --> 02:10:34,340
calling her is she

2772
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:35,660
and I got to the Dick.
I'm like,

2773
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:39,110
she showed his dick.
But um,

2774
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:41,840
she was beautiful.
So beautiful that she was walking up the

2775
02:10:41,841 --> 02:10:43,550
hill,
are driving up the hill,

2776
02:10:43,551 --> 02:10:44,550
you know,
by the.

2777
02:10:44,660 --> 02:10:46,610
We used to be the hyatt next to the 
comments to her.

2778
02:10:47,090 --> 02:10:49,520
She was driving up that hill and Eddie 
Bravo and I were coming down the hill.

2779
02:10:49,521 --> 02:10:52,100
We were walking and she was coming up 
and Eddy looked at.

2780
02:10:52,101 --> 02:10:53,660
He goes,
God damn,

2781
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:55,100
like,
and I go,

2782
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:56,180
oh,
that's my friend.

2783
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:57,950
I go,
she used to be a dude,

2784
02:10:58,340 --> 02:10:59,151
and he goes,
you know,

2785
02:10:59,151 --> 02:11:00,800
are you sure?
Are you fucking with me?

2786
02:11:00,801 --> 02:11:01,670
You fuck with me?
I go,

2787
02:11:01,671 --> 02:11:02,270
no,
no.

2788
02:11:02,270 --> 02:11:05,450
She was definitely used to be a dude and
then she said Hi.

2789
02:11:05,451 --> 02:11:05,901
And I said,
oh,

2790
02:11:05,901 --> 02:11:06,740
what's up?
How you doing?

2791
02:11:06,741 --> 02:11:07,580
Everything good,
but blah blah.

2792
02:11:07,581 --> 02:11:09,380
We talked and then we went down there 
and he goes,

2793
02:11:09,381 --> 02:11:11,540
oh my God,
I can't believe they used to be a guy.

2794
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:13,120
I can't believe it.
He was.

2795
02:11:13,121 --> 02:11:15,200
Now I'm so confused now.
I don't know.

2796
02:11:15,230 --> 02:11:16,640
I thought I would be able to tell.
I thought,

2797
02:11:16,650 --> 02:11:18,230
totally ideal spot one.
I'm like,

2798
02:11:18,231 --> 02:11:19,910
you can't spot her.
She's,

2799
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:23,660
she's an inch inches dick.
She's as girly as it gets.

2800
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:25,393
We should pitch that show where the 
transgender set like normal guys with 

2801
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:32,470
they see if they guess it,
see what the reaction is.

2802
02:11:32,530 --> 02:11:36,290
The next day guys would get violent.
That's how Jenny Jones got canceled from

2803
02:11:36,291 --> 02:11:37,310
TV.
Don't you remember?

2804
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:41,020
Shannon Jones had an episode where it 
was like,

2805
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:45,380
my secret crush in the guy had a secret 
crush on this.

2806
02:11:45,381 --> 02:11:46,214
Uh,
this dude that he worked with and the 

2807
02:11:48,171 --> 02:11:50,840
dude that he worked with had no idea 
what the fuck was going on.

2808
02:11:50,841 --> 02:11:54,830
He was on the show and we're here to 
tell you that someone has a secret crush

2809
02:11:54,831 --> 02:11:57,710
on you and the guy gets out may I 
always,

2810
02:11:58,570 --> 02:11:59,403
you know,
he,

2811
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:01,490
he got out there and he was like really 
flamboyant.

2812
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:04,650
And the guy got angry,
went over to his house and shot him,

2813
02:12:05,630 --> 02:12:09,080
fucking killed him.
And they just sweat to pull the plug.

2814
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:11,270
We won't do it.
So it doesn't exist anymore.

2815
02:12:11,271 --> 02:12:13,620
Check that's already had the operation 
side.

2816
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:15,713
After they fucking suck.
Then you break it to them like with a 

2817
02:12:17,661 --> 02:12:21,080
guard.
This guy comes out with a gun.

2818
02:12:21,110 --> 02:12:22,940
No,
they did it after the show was over.

2819
02:12:22,941 --> 02:12:24,950
The guy went to his house and killed.
He killed them.

2820
02:12:24,951 --> 02:12:26,690
I a couple of days,
but that's fine.

2821
02:12:26,691 --> 02:12:27,370
Listen.
Okay,

2822
02:12:27,370 --> 02:12:30,410
that's fine.
And somebody tells you,

2823
02:12:30,411 --> 02:12:31,960
you ain't leaving the house for a week,
dog.

2824
02:12:31,970 --> 02:12:35,750
This is what you do.
You film all the episodes in two days.

2825
02:12:36,230 --> 02:12:38,150
So if they die,
they die.

2826
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:39,980
Fuck,
you already made your vague.

2827
02:12:39,981 --> 02:12:42,290
You gotta fucking 100 episodes in the 
can.

2828
02:12:42,830 --> 02:12:44,140
Fuck him.
He's probably going to kill people.

2829
02:12:44,150 --> 02:12:45,830
That's no after I fucked that.

2830
02:12:45,830 --> 02:12:47,690
You sit them down and go,
how was your day?

2831
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:49,910
It was great.
I'd never been with a woman.

2832
02:12:49,930 --> 02:12:51,750
So magical.
What did we tell you that I am?

2833
02:12:51,770 --> 02:12:53,270
It was really thick.
The Jack.

2834
02:12:54,070 --> 02:12:58,860
He just a dick back in the eighties on 
the sunset strip and the guy just fried.

2835
02:12:58,880 --> 02:12:59,390
I mean,
what?

2836
02:12:59,390 --> 02:13:01,280
What could you do?
Like he's going to kill somebody.

2837
02:13:01,290 --> 02:13:02,570
Someone.
You don't get the wrong.

2838
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:05,200
If it happened to you,
what would you do?

2839
02:13:05,210 --> 02:13:08,190
Depends how good the buzzy was.
Good.

2840
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:10,073
Then he was really a woman all alone.
Here's the was meant to give back 

2841
02:13:12,770 --> 02:13:14,060
monkey.
Here's the total.

2842
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:16,460
Here's the total rub.
Okay?

2843
02:13:16,550 --> 02:13:17,383
This is the 100 percent dudes are 
willing to accept a artificially 

2844
02:13:21,801 --> 02:13:23,360
enhanced breasts,
right?

2845
02:13:23,570 --> 02:13:24,620
No problem.
I mean,

2846
02:13:24,621 --> 02:13:25,454
some guys don't prefer them,
but they're willing to accept 

2847
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:31,710
artificially enhanced breast,
so breast that change your body and they

2848
02:13:31,711 --> 02:13:32,040
turn

2849
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:36,090
your body into something that's more,
more womanly or more,

2850
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:36,973
uh,
for whatever reason that activates that 

2851
02:13:38,521 --> 02:13:40,860
part of your lizard brain that sees the 
big,

2852
02:13:40,861 --> 02:13:41,694
fleshy tits and thinks that this,
this girl will be able to take care of 

2853
02:13:43,801 --> 02:13:44,590
my babies.
Well,

2854
02:13:44,590 --> 02:13:46,050
she's,
she's very fertile.

2855
02:13:46,051 --> 02:13:46,884
These are good genes.
That's the same gene that gives you the 

2856
02:13:48,601 --> 02:13:49,434
big ass,
like the big ass and big tits like that 

2857
02:13:51,241 --> 02:13:52,074
sparks the is like a flame.
It's not as a matter of someone giving 

2858
02:13:54,601 --> 02:13:55,434
you affection.
It's a matter of someone giving you 

2859
02:13:56,731 --> 02:14:00,810
affection in a very specific shape that 
that rings in your brain.

2860
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:01,883
Well,
they can do that and do that absolutely 

2861
02:14:03,811 --> 02:14:06,120
perfectly and they will be able to 
eventually,

2862
02:14:06,121 --> 02:14:06,954
if they can already right now and turn a
guy into the exact shape of a woman 

2863
02:14:11,461 --> 02:14:14,070
that's hot as fuck.
At the end of the day,

2864
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:18,450
you can search around for some fucking 
hidden cracker Jack Toy.

2865
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:21,510
It can lift her up and look around and 
try to figure out,

2866
02:14:21,511 --> 02:14:24,390
okay,
I know I guess is this a woman?

2867
02:14:24,510 --> 02:14:27,930
I just looks exactly like a woman.
It feels like a woman.

2868
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:28,793
It talks like a woman,
goddammit is as a woman and you'll 

2869
02:14:32,161 --> 02:14:32,994
eventually decide that it's a woman 
because your brain processes that as 

2870
02:14:36,721 --> 02:14:37,554
female,
your brain processes the words is 

2871
02:14:39,271 --> 02:14:42,450
female,
the shape is female and if someone could

2872
02:14:42,451 --> 02:14:46,350
figure out how to do it just perfectly,
just perfectly genetically,

2873
02:14:46,410 --> 02:14:48,630
they figured out how to go in there and 
fucking tweak this shit.

2874
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:51,180
They're close to doing crazy shit like 
that.

2875
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:52,253
You saw that thing that I'm Rhonda.
Patrick tweeted that I retweeted with 

2876
02:14:56,191 --> 02:14:58,200
about the pigs.
Look what they do.

2877
02:14:58,260 --> 02:14:59,093
They're doing a pig's man.
They figured out a way to delete a gene 

2878
02:15:01,261 --> 02:15:03,540
and pigs and they come like incredible 
hulk pigs.

2879
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:04,680
She,
uh,

2880
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:06,390
she put up a photo of it today.

2881
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:07,553
They're doing all kinds of weird shit 
with genetics and they're already doing 

2882
02:15:10,171 --> 02:15:12,780
this on people.
She says in China,

2883
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:15,750
she's coming on the podcasts soon to 
talk to me about it.

2884
02:15:16,290 --> 02:15:18,840
I can't wait to talk about it,
but look at these fucking pigs,

2885
02:15:18,841 --> 02:15:20,520
man.
This is crazy.

2886
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,280
They're hulk pigs.
Live the ass and that pig.

2887
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:26,910
It's like a bowl.
A lot of you are in a pig,

2888
02:15:26,911 --> 02:15:28,740
but.
But you know what I'm saying?

2889
02:15:28,741 --> 02:15:32,790
Like this is a.
This is a new thing they're doing to the

2890
02:15:32,791 --> 02:15:33,624
bodies of these animals.
They're gonna be able to do that to 

2891
02:15:35,191 --> 02:15:36,840
people,
to a man and they're gonna.

2892
02:15:36,841 --> 02:15:39,360
Be able to turn a man into a woman like 
perfectly.

2893
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:42,600
There'll be able to literally get in 
there and dig around,

2894
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:44,513
switch this,
turn that off and turn this on and 

2895
02:15:46,980 --> 02:15:49,910
you're a woman.
I mean it's going happen.

2896
02:15:50,070 --> 02:15:53,550
It's just a matter of time mean I don't 
know if they're ever going to be able to

2897
02:15:53,551 --> 02:15:54,384
turn a dick into vagina without surgery,
but I kind of imagined one day they 

2898
02:15:56,941 --> 02:15:58,680
will,
one day they'll just be able to.

2899
02:15:58,710 --> 02:16:01,080
You could go back and forth.
There's an APP for it.

2900
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:05,670
One day it's the government will have a 
switch,

2901
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:06,533
will just decide,
today we're going to be a girl day 

2902
02:16:08,370 --> 02:16:09,203
today.
Everyone is going to learn to be more 

2903
02:16:10,081 --> 02:16:13,410
sensitive to women because we're all 
going to be women and just hit a switch.

2904
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:19,350
An entire city is a woman and then 
that's when the mongols invade come over

2905
02:16:19,351 --> 02:16:22,110
the hill and fuck everyone,
including all the Alpha males.

2906
02:16:22,170 --> 02:16:25,050
They just kept fucked like chicks and 
here's a secret.

2907
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:27,450
They like it.
They like it because their checks.

2908
02:16:27,451 --> 02:16:29,360
Now,
Joe,

2909
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:30,190
do you have a tight pussy

2910
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:33,970
today?
Got To replenish with.

2911
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:37,600
I got a new shot at the doctor.
I went to the dentist.

2912
02:16:37,601 --> 02:16:39,490
He cleaned my teeth and made my pussy 
tyler.

2913
02:16:42,350 --> 02:16:45,490
To kind of be able to do that at home 
with your own printer.

2914
02:16:45,850 --> 02:16:48,590
You're going to be finger printed,
artificial vagina,

2915
02:16:48,591 --> 02:16:51,550
and that just like way tighter.
You're going to hit the right keys.

2916
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:53,880
Apple one click,
you know,

2917
02:16:53,890 --> 02:16:54,723
and your vagina just out.
You're going to have chips in your body 

2918
02:16:57,611 --> 02:16:59,980
that tell your body what to do.
That's 100 percent.

2919
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:02,470
There's going to be artificial blood.
That's 100 percent.

2920
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:04,600
Nano bots,
those little,

2921
02:17:05,390 --> 02:17:10,390
they're devising these tiny little itsy 
bitsy blood cells,

2922
02:17:10,431 --> 02:17:13,240
sized machines.
This is what they're going to eventually

2923
02:17:13,241 --> 02:17:15,010
have.
Some day that'll fight cancer,

2924
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:18,190
so if you have like a cancerous growth 
in your body,

2925
02:17:18,370 --> 02:17:23,370
there'll be able to send these machines 
through your bloodstream to attack these

2926
02:17:23,441 --> 02:17:24,700
six areas of your body.

2927
02:17:25,220 --> 02:17:26,053
I mean,
we're going to see some fucking nutty 

2928
02:17:27,461 --> 02:17:28,294
shit in our day and a man turning into a
woman that was like the least of the 

2929
02:17:31,121 --> 02:17:32,860
nutty shit.
If we could stay alive,

2930
02:17:32,920 --> 02:17:34,870
we could all in this room stay alive to 
100.

2931
02:17:35,110 --> 02:17:36,190
What can I see?
Some shit.

2932
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:38,520
But he hasn't cut this DICLOFENAC.
Caitlin,

2933
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:40,073
when we're that like someone questioning
were in the middle of a conversation in 

2934
02:17:44,141 --> 02:17:49,141
your own head and he introduced it to us
and brought him up.

2935
02:17:50,930 --> 02:17:53,470
Everybody's all excited,
but he hasn't cut his dick off yet.

2936
02:17:53,710 --> 02:17:55,530
So why is everybody jumping up and down 
for?

2937
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:56,381
Well,
because,

2938
02:17:56,381 --> 02:17:57,214
uh,
he is allowed to keep his penis and 

2939
02:17:58,421 --> 02:17:59,460
still be a woman job.
No,

2940
02:17:59,550 --> 02:17:59,941
no,
no,

2941
02:17:59,941 --> 02:18:00,351
no,
no,

2942
02:18:00,351 --> 02:18:00,801
no,
no,

2943
02:18:00,801 --> 02:18:01,270
no,
no,

2944
02:18:01,270 --> 02:18:03,800
no.
Don't worry.

2945
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:08,440
Don't worry.
His deck off.

2946
02:18:08,810 --> 02:18:10,600
Step stepping.
He's taking pictures.

2947
02:18:10,601 --> 02:18:13,030
Everybody's jumping up and down.
He still hasn't gone through the forum.

2948
02:18:13,690 --> 02:18:15,840
Once you go into the forum and cut that 
motherfucker off,

2949
02:18:15,850 --> 02:18:17,740
then you come see uncle joey.
That's a true story.

2950
02:18:17,770 --> 02:18:19,420
Until then,
once you go to the farm,

2951
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:21,820
then come back and say,
he hasn't gone yet.

2952
02:18:21,850 --> 02:18:23,920
This is a trick by the wife.
This is a trick.

2953
02:18:23,950 --> 02:18:27,360
This is a fucking train ratings.
Something's going on something man.

2954
02:18:27,940 --> 02:18:32,940
He got his face fixed facial surgery,
so fucking stolen.

2955
02:18:35,380 --> 02:18:36,910
Everybody got that face to face?
No,

2956
02:18:36,970 --> 02:18:37,803
not like this.
Like he went through feminization 

2957
02:18:39,671 --> 02:18:40,504
surgery where they like shortened his 
jaw and change his lips and the whole 

2958
02:18:44,561 --> 02:18:46,480
deal.
Have you seen the recent photos?

2959
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:49,420
Look at the vanity fair across the 
street.

2960
02:18:49,421 --> 02:18:50,254
Big Mind.
He put a pussy in there and he hasn't 

2961
02:18:52,631 --> 02:18:55,000
changed his job.
He's out there sucking Dick two nights a

2962
02:18:55,001 --> 02:18:55,341
week.
Yeah.

2963
02:18:55,341 --> 02:18:56,930
Let's put it in there.
Yeah.

2964
02:18:59,470 --> 02:19:01,640
No.
Mike is under construction store.

2965
02:19:01,690 --> 02:19:05,980
I don't really.
He's got a bald spot.

2966
02:19:06,020 --> 02:19:08,510
He's got to pull the wig over it.
But his roommate,

2967
02:19:08,590 --> 02:19:11,110
Leslie did everything.
She got the cheeks,

2968
02:19:11,111 --> 02:19:13,150
the face.
So she was a man?

2969
02:19:13,151 --> 02:19:13,984
Yes.
Okay.

2970
02:19:14,450 --> 02:19:15,820
Say this is.
Look at these photos.

2971
02:19:16,090 --> 02:19:16,923
Look at the photos,
like a closeup ones or the face like 

2972
02:19:19,691 --> 02:19:24,060
right there,
like he had a shitload of things done,

2973
02:19:24,090 --> 02:19:26,830
isn't it?
May seem like a high maintenance guy.

2974
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:28,190
Oh yeah.
He's crazy

2975
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:29,030
as fuck.
Well,

2976
02:19:29,031 --> 02:19:29,990
here's the thing,
man.

2977
02:19:30,080 --> 02:19:33,260
You know when we were,
when we were watching that interview,

2978
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:34,760
when he got interviewed by,
what was it?

2979
02:19:34,761 --> 02:19:35,690
Diane Sawyer,
Zoho.

2980
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:38,140
It wasn't interviewed him.
What?

2981
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:42,330
He was loving all the attention.
He was loving it.

2982
02:19:42,350 --> 02:19:43,183
He's loving the opportunity to talk 
about himself and talk about having the 

2983
02:19:47,030 --> 02:19:50,360
hold up that pull that image of Jesus 
Christmas.

2984
02:19:51,410 --> 02:19:52,243
I love.
I was trying to hide those giant canoe 

2985
02:19:53,211 --> 02:19:54,044
feed.
That's the fuck out of here with those 

2986
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:57,640
size 38 flippers.
It must go up.

2987
02:19:57,670 --> 02:19:58,503
Skirt thing going fucking Munich free.
Then motherfucking jumped in Munich and 

2988
02:20:01,641 --> 02:20:02,474
shit.
Look at it.

2989
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:05,150
It's just.
It's very strange man.

2990
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:06,193
I mean that.
That is a very feminine looking man or 

2991
02:20:08,330 --> 02:20:09,650
woman.
Joey,

2992
02:20:09,651 --> 02:20:11,090
you want to transition?
I should say.

2993
02:20:11,091 --> 02:20:11,924
You know I mean in transition.
She's very feminine looking like what 

2994
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:16,940
they've done,
their face if they,

2995
02:20:16,950 --> 02:20:18,260
if she really looked like that.

2996
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:19,333
So this is the thing.
When you're looking at something like 

2997
02:20:20,631 --> 02:20:21,464
this,
this has been through more fucking 

2998
02:20:22,791 --> 02:20:23,624
computers,
I mean more screens and filters and we 

2999
02:20:27,171 --> 02:20:28,004
all know that we all know about the 
difference between what someone would 

3000
02:20:30,681 --> 02:20:31,514
look like in real life and so on look 
like in like a super well done 

3001
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:36,320
photograph like that.
It's a big difference,

3002
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:41,390
but a man good for her if that's what 
she wants to do now.

3003
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:43,700
Same thing we were talking about before 
about gay marriage.

3004
02:20:44,030 --> 02:20:46,220
Good for her.
If this is what she enjoys,

3005
02:20:46,670 --> 02:20:47,503
I'm glad that she can be on the cover of
magazine and it could be a fun time for 

3006
02:20:50,991 --> 02:20:52,280
everybody.
You know,

3007
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:56,490
when we were kids,
this could have never happened.

3008
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:58,560
No,
never.

3009
02:21:00,380 --> 02:21:01,440
It's weird though,
right?

3010
02:21:01,580 --> 02:21:05,870
And it did happen when we were kids that
happened because I watched the report or

3011
02:21:05,871 --> 02:21:06,704
when it happened,
it happened in another country and we 

3012
02:21:08,871 --> 02:21:09,704
just didn't know about it.
It happened like in Germany or 

3013
02:21:10,971 --> 02:21:11,804
somewhere,
somebody like in 1940 and some American 

3014
02:21:14,361 --> 02:21:15,530
did it.
We just,

3015
02:21:15,531 --> 02:21:18,410
there was no internet so we weren't very
hip to it.

3016
02:21:18,411 --> 02:21:19,510
You know,
when I was in Seattle,

3017
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:20,790
young comic,
we had to read it,

3018
02:21:20,810 --> 02:21:23,390
read had done the operation.
Rita was a Japanese man,

3019
02:21:24,100 --> 02:21:28,670
but became a Japanese woman,
but she died because first off she had a

3020
02:21:28,671 --> 02:21:31,430
lot of psychological problems that came 
after the surgery.

3021
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,720
I loved Rido Rido let me for the house.
My first fucking head shot.

3022
02:21:35,721 --> 02:21:36,554
I never forgot that man.
I pay the back and everything read it 

3023
02:21:39,051 --> 02:21:42,020
died because I head was too fucking big 
from being a man.

3024
02:21:42,290 --> 02:21:45,970
What?
So her balance was off after the surgery

3025
02:21:47,430 --> 02:21:48,170
balances.

3026
02:21:48,170 --> 02:21:51,130
All of those comments.
How's that possible?

3027
02:21:51,131 --> 02:21:53,080
What about Brad was like,
if I become a.

3028
02:21:53,081 --> 02:21:54,650
it's like A.
Brad becomes a woman.

3029
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:57,200
Oh,
his head's gonna be fucking ginormous.

3030
02:21:57,500 --> 02:22:01,230
And his balance is going to be off from 
time to time something happened.

3031
02:22:01,380 --> 02:22:06,140
They did the surgery to him,
to her that her balance got taken off.

3032
02:22:06,200 --> 02:22:10,140
She died because she suffered a fall at 
a disco and bang,

3033
02:22:10,141 --> 02:22:12,620
the head read.
It was an open mic comic.

3034
02:22:12,621 --> 02:22:15,500
They used to run with us in Seattle and 
she'd come out.

3035
02:22:15,501 --> 02:22:16,520
She had the nails.
I mean,

3036
02:22:16,521 --> 02:22:18,650
nobody's gonna Fuck Rita out.
Trust me,

3037
02:22:19,130 --> 02:22:22,970
nobody ever thought of fucking read off 
my hands will fucking hard.

3038
02:22:23,310 --> 02:22:24,143
It looked like Herman Munster hand.
She had the nails and she would get 

3039
02:22:27,001 --> 02:22:31,500
Nachos and then she'd go to get a drink 
and we'd take her Nachos and she'd yell.

3040
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:33,870
She had a very feminine voice,
like yes darling.

3041
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:39,200
But she looked at who's getting matched 
with go it was fucking scary and to make

3042
02:22:42,280 --> 02:22:46,110
money.
The government or the doctors gave her a

3043
02:22:46,111 --> 02:22:46,944
certain amount of a month and she became
a pill addict because the pain from the 

3044
02:22:50,671 --> 02:22:53,820
surgery plus all the psychological and 
everything.

3045
02:22:53,821 --> 02:22:54,421
Like she,
you know,

3046
02:22:54,421 --> 02:22:56,830
she,
she was raised in like the fort,

3047
02:22:56,850 --> 02:22:59,270
you know,
when I met Rita in [inaudible] 95 read.

3048
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:01,680
It was 50 already,
you know what I'm saying?

3049
02:23:01,980 --> 02:23:04,290
So I was 20 something,
maybe 30.

3050
02:23:04,710 --> 02:23:06,750
So she was telling me that when she was 
growing up,

3051
02:23:06,751 --> 02:23:10,590
my mother and father would beat her when
she would tell him that she was really a

3052
02:23:10,591 --> 02:23:12,340
woman.
Wow.

3053
02:23:12,341 --> 02:23:14,880
Like it was just too much abuse in her 
life.

3054
02:23:15,210 --> 02:23:18,150
And then once she finally became a 
woman,

3055
02:23:19,220 --> 02:23:21,690
there was so much baggage,
you know,

3056
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:26,220
I'm doing it like in talking to him at 
the comedy club and her telling me,

3057
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,500
you know,
as creepy as it was that,

3058
02:23:29,010 --> 02:23:29,843
you know,
she was,

3059
02:23:29,850 --> 02:23:32,770
she would have to go see a shrink three 
times a week still.

3060
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:33,673
What was,
what was the big that she's talking 

3061
02:23:35,281 --> 02:23:37,950
about with the big issue?
Was that transition,

3062
02:23:37,951 --> 02:23:40,020
was it a transition transition?
You know,

3063
02:23:40,021 --> 02:23:43,020
but she ate a lot of bells.
She did a lot of powder.

3064
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:44,273
She had tons of money.
I don't know where she got the money 

3065
02:23:46,891 --> 02:23:49,230
from.
I know she sold drugs.

3066
02:23:49,290 --> 02:23:50,123
Uh,
she even came down here to see me once 

3067
02:23:51,841 --> 02:23:54,330
when I was at the comedy store,
like in [inaudible] 99.

3068
02:23:55,170 --> 02:23:56,003
And she died shortly after that.
She fell off the stage and went into a 

3069
02:23:58,571 --> 02:24:01,080
coma and died.
And we're joking around.

3070
02:24:01,081 --> 02:24:02,640
And it was true.
Her head was too big.

3071
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:03,533
There's a lot to do with their pills.
She's taking pills is more likely I'd 

3072
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:13,040
been in contact in my life that maybe,
uh,

3073
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:15,450
maybe two or three transgenders,
man,

3074
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:16,523
you know,
like on the streets when I was a kid in 

3075
02:24:18,121 --> 02:24:23,121
New York City or something and something
was always missing,

3076
02:24:24,170 --> 02:24:24,780
you know what I'm saying?

3077
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:27,620
Even after they did the surgery,
something's always not right.

3078
02:24:27,621 --> 02:24:29,820
You're wrong.
And they just did something major,

3079
02:24:29,821 --> 02:24:32,310
Major.
It's a major step.

3080
02:24:32,580 --> 02:24:33,413
We're just strolling it around with 
these fucking idiots and they're going 

3081
02:24:35,451 --> 02:24:37,140
to start throwing it around like a 
tattoo.

3082
02:24:37,410 --> 02:24:39,780
That's the part of it that I don't like 
that.

3083
02:24:39,781 --> 02:24:40,614
Now every time somebody feels feminine,
they're gonna want to have this fucking 

3084
02:24:43,771 --> 02:24:45,660
surgery.
You know what I'm saying?

3085
02:24:45,661 --> 02:24:47,820
Like one day you feel confused or 
whatever,

3086
02:24:48,010 --> 02:24:51,240
you know,
this is the part of it I don't like.

3087
02:24:51,270 --> 02:24:53,520
I get all this gender stuff and I get 
it,

3088
02:24:53,550 --> 02:24:54,720
man,
that you're a woman,

3089
02:24:54,721 --> 02:24:55,554
that you were born feeling this.
But in today's society we got too many 

3090
02:24:58,381 --> 02:25:00,930
sheep that too many weeks olds out there
though,

3091
02:25:02,190 --> 02:25:03,860
you know,
it still argue about,

3092
02:25:04,390 --> 02:25:05,700
no,
it's not good.

3093
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:09,150
And those are the people I worry about,
those people that,

3094
02:25:09,151 --> 02:25:09,984
you know,
you ever go somewhere and you hear 

3095
02:25:10,921 --> 02:25:11,754
people talking,
you know who's there just to try to be 

3096
02:25:14,251 --> 02:25:15,084
there.
It's like,

3097
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:18,480
I'll never forget this.
I went through a a restaurant or it's to

3098
02:25:18,481 --> 02:25:21,120
Santa Monica and there was a guy behind 
me and I'm always eating.

3099
02:25:21,570 --> 02:25:22,980
I said,
nobody's this gay.

3100
02:25:25,450 --> 02:25:28,540
Nobody could be this guy.
This guy was not born like this.

3101
02:25:28,990 --> 02:25:31,420
This one.
This guy is something that he does to be

3102
02:25:31,421 --> 02:25:32,254
accepted.
He doesn't even know what he's doing in 

3103
02:25:33,491 --> 02:25:34,324
six years.
He won't be gained no more than six 

3104
02:25:35,831 --> 02:25:36,664
years.
You don't have a wife and a kid living 

3105
02:25:37,241 --> 02:25:40,740
in Idaho to be a farmer,
but he's just doing this to fit in this.

3106
02:25:40,741 --> 02:25:41,574
Just like I have a lot of that.
I feel a lot of that with people today 

3107
02:25:44,891 --> 02:25:49,480
in our society a lot.
I feel people are not completely in.

3108
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:51,850
There's some people where there's not 
people in,

3109
02:25:51,851 --> 02:25:52,684
they're not there.
And that's why I tell people before you 

3110
02:25:54,671 --> 02:25:55,504
go in there fucking think it over,
whether it's hanging out with devil 

3111
02:25:58,241 --> 02:25:59,074
worshipers,
hanging out with drug dealers or 

3112
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:03,700
whatever the fuck you want to do.
Because once you're in,

3113
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:04,833
you're in,
you're going to end up kidnapping 

3114
02:26:05,471 --> 02:26:06,490
somebody with a machine gun.

3115
02:26:06,730 --> 02:26:09,070
Don't tell me what the fuck I know.
I know.

3116
02:26:09,071 --> 02:26:12,230
When somebody is faking the funk.
There's people that one.

3117
02:26:12,270 --> 02:26:13,710
When I was a kid,
Jimmy [inaudible],

3118
02:26:13,770 --> 02:26:16,660
who was my brother,
I knew he was gay.

3119
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:17,523
I knew he was slinging dick,
but no fucking genius to tell you that 

3120
02:26:20,531 --> 02:26:22,570
my brother,
I grew up in his house,

3121
02:26:22,571 --> 02:26:25,300
but his other three brothers,
you couldn't tell he was gay.

3122
02:26:25,540 --> 02:26:28,120
If he came to me today and said,
I'm a transgender,

3123
02:26:28,390 --> 02:26:30,300
I would hug him and go dogs.
It's great.

3124
02:26:30,490 --> 02:26:34,390
I can tell you what Dick suck.
I didn't have no doubts in my heart that

3125
02:26:34,391 --> 02:26:35,224
you weren't going to suck Dick even 
though you were fucking girls in the 

3126
02:26:36,911 --> 02:26:38,980
neighborhood because you were so good 
looking.

3127
02:26:39,550 --> 02:26:41,500
You know what I'm saying?
You grew up with people that you look at

3128
02:26:41,501 --> 02:26:42,334
it and go,
who's sometimes you go to the store and 

3129
02:26:45,221 --> 02:26:46,420
you see people that you go.

3130
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:49,540
It's like when you see Eddie Murphy in 
person,

3131
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:51,513
you're like,
this guy could be a fucking go go 

3132
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:54,073
dancer.
On the weekends when you see Eddie 

3133
02:26:56,050 --> 02:26:57,550
Murphy,
I always said Eddie Murphy should win an

3134
02:26:57,551 --> 02:26:59,980
academy award because when he in the 
movie,

3135
02:26:59,981 --> 02:27:03,700
he's a man of many men.
When you see Eddie Murphy in person,

3136
02:27:03,701 --> 02:27:06,880
you're like,
the room is could be true.

3137
02:27:07,310 --> 02:27:09,670
Something about him and I ain't mad at 
that.

3138
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:12,550
I'm to one of his biggest fans.
I'm just telling you the truth that as a

3139
02:27:12,551 --> 02:27:13,384
man,
you're around other fucking men and you 

3140
02:27:15,191 --> 02:27:16,040
know,
right?

3141
02:27:16,300 --> 02:27:18,210
You know who you might be able to talk 
to,

3142
02:27:18,211 --> 02:27:21,790
suck a Dick at three in the morning.
We all have that person that we go home,

3143
02:27:21,791 --> 02:27:24,100
we loved that person.
We accept that person,

3144
02:27:24,340 --> 02:27:27,270
but you know one night if you have a 
pill and acquaintance,

3145
02:27:27,310 --> 02:27:31,090
you might be able to clock this guy a 
guy in boogie nights.

3146
02:27:32,220 --> 02:27:34,510
There's people like that,
that they walk around,

3147
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:36,070
you know,
little ticket,

3148
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:37,990
they acted,
they got into a tight spot one night.

3149
02:27:38,370 --> 02:27:41,530
Okay.
And that night in Hollywood,

3150
02:27:41,531 --> 02:27:42,364
I really.
And I felt bad about what I was 

3151
02:27:43,151 --> 02:27:45,640
thinking.
I felt this guy was just doing it.

3152
02:27:45,641 --> 02:27:47,770
So the bowl with these guys on Tuesday 
nights,

3153
02:27:47,771 --> 02:27:49,000
you know,
20 years ago,

3154
02:27:49,001 --> 02:27:50,590
what am I the only retarding the room 
man.

3155
02:27:50,591 --> 02:27:53,740
Hey shh.
When lesbian that she did,

3156
02:27:53,741 --> 02:27:55,320
she not,
she was Baiting fucking ellen.

3157
02:27:55,360 --> 02:27:56,193
You are that one fan to become famous.
So she became a lesbian and she takes 

3158
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,570
out a brass balls and now what is she 
got?

3159
02:28:03,510 --> 02:28:04,620
Okay.
The husband,

3160
02:28:04,750 --> 02:28:05,770
you know,
stick.

3161
02:28:05,890 --> 02:28:06,723
I think people,
a lot of people move to Hollywood or in 

3162
02:28:08,380 --> 02:28:10,960
society and just to fit in.
They'll do shit.

3163
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:12,670
No do shit.
Then they realized,

3164
02:28:12,671 --> 02:28:15,790
well this is where I fucking got.
They do it man.

3165
02:28:15,791 --> 02:28:18,790
We live in a sheep fucking society for 
that.

3166
02:28:19,150 --> 02:28:22,640
We're all trying to be the same person.
If you look around,

3167
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:26,570
we're all looking the same.
When you go to silver lake and do motlow

3168
02:28:27,170 --> 02:28:29,780
and you get on stage,
look at the people and the 80 percent of

3169
02:28:29,781 --> 02:28:32,960
people look the same.
They all got the same fucking glasses,

3170
02:28:32,961 --> 02:28:37,130
the same tight jeans,
the same fat fueled the Chinese sign.

3171
02:28:37,340 --> 02:28:41,270
Everybody's wanting to meet up insanely 
everybody's.

3172
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:45,020
You know,
you wake up in the morning,

3173
02:28:45,021 --> 02:28:45,854
walk into a studio for an audition.
What does everybody have in front of 

3174
02:28:48,231 --> 02:28:49,780
them?
A couple of what?

3175
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,290
Starbucks.
Starbucks,

3176
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:52,153
and if you ain't got starbucks,
you weren't invited to the fucking 

3177
02:28:53,811 --> 02:28:54,800
party.
You see,

3178
02:28:54,801 --> 02:28:56,870
starbucks raised their prices 20 percent
again.

3179
02:28:57,410 --> 02:28:58,850
How much more are you going to pay for 
coffee?

3180
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:00,320
They got you hooked.
It got you hooked.

3181
02:29:00,321 --> 02:29:01,490
They want that money.
It's not.

3182
02:29:01,560 --> 02:29:03,320
It's not coffee.
Everybody got coffee.

3183
02:29:03,470 --> 02:29:06,410
It's the status of going to starbucks.
Oh my God,

3184
02:29:06,510 --> 02:29:09,320
isn't it scatters.
I'm like,

3185
02:29:09,321 --> 02:29:11,480
God,
how many times you see who's impressing?

3186
02:29:11,530 --> 02:29:13,910
You go to starbucks over the car.
I go to coffee bean.

3187
02:29:13,911 --> 02:29:15,770
They have better croissant.
It's doesn't matter.

3188
02:29:15,771 --> 02:29:18,750
You don't have to.
Today's society.

3189
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:21,230
When we were growing up in Boston or 
Denver,

3190
02:29:21,231 --> 02:29:22,064
you lived at your grandfather's and 
newer people that have a little fucking 

3191
02:29:24,470 --> 02:29:28,040
blue cup that's in coffee and then went 
to a diner and you said,

3192
02:29:28,070 --> 02:29:28,670
give me a.

3193
02:29:28,670 --> 02:29:29,690
What was the,
what was it called?

3194
02:29:29,720 --> 02:29:31,430
Do you remember these times?
The Greek stuff,

3195
02:29:31,690 --> 02:29:33,770
like little Greek guys.
What's it called?

3196
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:35,300
What's it called?
The coffee medium.

3197
02:29:35,301 --> 02:29:36,650
What do you.
How do you want a coffee?

3198
02:29:36,710 --> 02:29:37,990
Regularly?
Regular.

3199
02:29:38,020 --> 02:29:42,410
What's regular milk and sugar and two 
coffees and now look what we have,

3200
02:29:42,411 --> 02:29:45,100
but we didn't carry the coffee cups like
a bud was sick.

3201
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:46,910
When you go out and let you take a 
picture with somebody,

3202
02:29:47,090 --> 02:29:49,640
what do they always gotten?
The hint but the fucking beer down.

3203
02:29:49,880 --> 02:29:52,830
But nobody could put the beer down.
God forbid they don't party out.

3204
02:29:53,750 --> 02:29:58,750
God forbid dental part out.
Let's put the buckets so they can tell.

3205
02:29:58,821 --> 02:29:59,870
I'm drinking.
What the fuck?

3206
02:29:59,871 --> 02:30:03,290
Put The beat down your fuck St.
Copy that society.

3207
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:07,100
Everybody wants to fucking drink that

3208
02:30:07,910 --> 02:30:11,300
You ever had someone look at your comp?
The boys that fucking coffee bean.

3209
02:30:11,390 --> 02:30:12,770

Step Up.
No starbucks.

3212
02:30:15,440 --> 02:30:17,390
Why would you wait in donuts,
Bro?

3213
02:30:17,391 --> 02:30:19,570
I wouldn't relate on that line.
When you sat in 11,

3214
02:30:19,580 --> 02:30:22,180
got the same quote and now like know,
he says St Louis.

3215
02:30:22,230 --> 02:30:24,320
That Brazilian bold.
We'll keep you up to three days.

3216
02:30:24,321 --> 02:30:26,000
That's what I use is drinks.
Don't me.

3217
02:30:26,001 --> 02:30:29,770
My fucking pissed with the iced drinks.
Coffee.

3218
02:30:29,780 --> 02:30:31,210
Fuck you.
They drink fucking.

3219
02:30:32,120 --> 02:30:32,953
You have a drink.
You have a drink with zilliant both and 

3220
02:30:35,391 --> 02:30:37,740
fucking Dunkin donuts.
Swap you.

3221
02:30:39,060 --> 02:30:39,893
Can everybody be bionics and that type 
fungus doughnuts and get fucking bolt 

3222
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:57,440
and liquid.
Fucking fuck at Dunkin donuts.

3223
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:01,250
I agree with but not seven.
I don't even like them.

3224
02:31:01,251 --> 02:31:03,200
Can dollars because has seven,

3225
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:04,761
seven,
11.

3226
02:31:04,761 --> 02:31:07,220
The Old Brazilian bold.
Now they got it all fucked up.

3227
02:31:07,221 --> 02:31:08,830
I don't go for Dunkin donuts.
No,

3228
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:10,530
go for you.
Don't go for 7:11.

3229
02:31:10,670 --> 02:31:13,070
A Dunkin donuts in Encino.
By the time I dropped out.

3230
02:31:13,071 --> 02:31:16,460
Crash the fucking car so I can make the 
fucking house.

3231
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:19,500
I make the trip at the house.
What do you think?

3232
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:20,220
I'll

3233
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:21,620
tell you about the carrot cake cups.
Right?

3234
02:31:21,630 --> 02:31:23,250
Why do you think that Jamie?
Jamie,

3235
02:31:23,310 --> 02:31:27,480
get the manicure it take to have them 
still right in the car.

3236
02:31:28,590 --> 02:31:30,930
Why do you think I lead the Tom these 
pills so fast?

3237
02:31:32,020 --> 02:31:36,300
Because I gotta catch my stomach bugs by
men that into a Pumpkin at midnight.

3238
02:31:36,330 --> 02:31:37,800
Oh my God.
I drink the flat white.

3239
02:31:37,801 --> 02:31:38,634
The small one at midnight.
So you go right down the street to the 

3240
02:31:40,291 --> 02:31:43,410
one that's near a is at eight.
Magnolia,

3241
02:31:43,670 --> 02:31:47,580
Magnolia and riverside.
It's open til 12.

3242
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:51,720
Drive and is open till midnight.
I got up this morning at 4:15.

3243
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:52,913
I got nothing to do.
I shoot right to the tribe is open at 

3244
02:31:54,601 --> 02:31:55,850
4:30.
You know,

3245
02:31:55,860 --> 02:31:57,630
one of the things that I would do when I
was writing,

3246
02:31:57,660 --> 02:32:00,150
because I'd make a fucking pot of coffee
at night.

3247
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:01,710
Like you.
You'd be like midnight.

3248
02:32:01,711 --> 02:32:02,400
I start writing.

3249
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:03,960
I'll make a pot of coffee.
That's what I know.

3250
02:32:04,140 --> 02:32:05,600
I'm there to work.
I'm going to,

3251
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:08,430
you know,
big fucking French press you.

3252
02:32:08,850 --> 02:32:10,590
You said you got the white chocolate 
Mocha.

3253
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:12,630
I get the flat white.
I don't drink milk.

3254
02:32:12,690 --> 02:32:13,710
Flat White.
White chocolate.

3255
02:32:13,980 --> 02:32:14,880
You got to get out of here,
right?

3256
02:32:14,910 --> 02:32:15,181
No,
no,

3257
02:32:15,181 --> 02:32:16,280
no.
I'm talking about 15,

3258
02:32:16,310 --> 02:32:18,480
20 minutes.
I love the flat white from.

3259
02:32:18,810 --> 02:32:19,643
It's like,
oh,

3260
02:32:19,680 --> 02:32:22,800
it's like a fake fake on late yet.
I'll drink a small.

3261
02:32:22,830 --> 02:32:23,663
You know what I'm saying?
But if I'm home I'll crop that 

3262
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:25,433
motherfucker.
I'll do a double bustillo bleed right 

3263
02:32:28,351 --> 02:32:29,140
after that though.
Right?

3264
02:32:29,140 --> 02:32:33,440
Like cocaine for a cup of coffee.
Don't do nothing but uncle joey.

3265
02:32:33,450 --> 02:32:34,283
That's a double boost fellow.
I think I have add or some shit because 

3266
02:32:37,051 --> 02:32:38,970
sometimes I'll have a cup of coffee and 
I'll get sleepy.

3267
02:32:39,130 --> 02:32:40,210
Yeah,
me too.

3268
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:41,180
Me Too.
We'll still.

3269
02:32:41,210 --> 02:32:43,710
Nothing must come down.
What goes up must come down.

3270
02:32:45,470 --> 02:32:50,470
Must come down.
Must that guy.

3271
02:32:54,330 --> 02:32:55,163
That body.
And yet you got no home spinning wheel 

3272
02:33:07,410 --> 02:33:08,580
that Chicago,
isn't it?

3273
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:10,800
No,
I don't think it's.

3274
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:12,890
Is it Chicago?
Maybe.

3275
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:14,040
God Damn.
I don't know.

3276
02:33:14,041 --> 02:33:15,900
Is it three dog night?
Chicago.

3277
02:33:15,901 --> 02:33:20,160
It's got to be one of those fuckers 
spinning wheel.

3278
02:33:20,190 --> 02:33:21,180
Spinning wheel.
Sorry.

3279
02:33:24,320 --> 02:33:27,950
You guys are listening to the new apple 
music radio station.

3280
02:33:27,980 --> 02:33:28,813
No,
it's interesting because it's spinning 

3281
02:33:30,160 --> 02:33:33,470
wheel on Tla.
Say to stay away from it.

3282
02:33:33,620 --> 02:33:34,580
Blood,
sweat and tears.

3283
02:33:34,581 --> 02:33:36,710
Joey,
you blood,

3284
02:33:36,711 --> 02:33:38,300
sweat and tears.
That's crazy.

3285
02:33:40,340 --> 02:33:44,700
Are you fucking kidding me?
What a brilliant.

3286
02:33:44,710 --> 02:33:45,543
Put a fucking jam on dog.
What are you got to put the video on so 

3287
02:33:47,811 --> 02:33:50,750
I can show you motherfuckers end the 
book by Aerosmith.

3288
02:33:50,751 --> 02:33:54,890
He describes when he met his daughter 
for the first time at a concert.

3289
02:33:55,310 --> 02:33:57,890
He was onstage and his daughter.
Yeah,

3290
02:33:57,891 --> 02:33:59,180
the chick.
That's a norm again,

3291
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:01,130
steven,
for the first time.

3292
02:34:01,270 --> 02:34:02,090
No,
that dog.

3293
02:34:02,090 --> 02:34:03,650
No,
she didn't know who the father was.

3294
02:34:03,651 --> 02:34:04,820
It was between todd.

3295
02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:11,880
Brandon.
Todd glass was between Todd Rundgren and

3296
02:34:11,950 --> 02:34:13,110
Steven.
Steven Tyler,

3297
02:34:13,111 --> 02:34:14,760
and then her mother took her to see 
aerospace.

3298
02:34:14,770 --> 02:34:16,570
She goes,
that's my dad put up.

3299
02:34:17,410 --> 02:34:20,950
Todd rundgren a hello.
It's me.

3300
02:34:20,951 --> 02:34:23,230
Listen to this challenge.
Well,

3301
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:26,680
last time you heard this,
I haven't heard this in forever.

3302
02:34:26,710 --> 02:34:28,180
Listen to them.
I don't even know how it goes.

3303
02:34:28,270 --> 02:34:29,103
Oh my God.
This is when singing is when you had to 

3304
02:34:30,641 --> 02:34:32,440
have a voice dog.
She's gonna Knock.

3305
02:34:32,620 --> 02:34:36,360
Kick you off of Youtube and Youtube.
Yeah,

3306
02:34:37,100 --> 02:34:40,020
listen to that.
We might have to edit this to the kids.

3307
02:34:40,210 --> 02:34:42,070
Don't put the videos.
A lot of work for this guy.

3308
02:34:42,580 --> 02:34:44,660
It's not that simple,
but you to see the village,

3309
02:34:44,690 --> 02:34:47,500
see what it looks like.
This is him.

3310
02:34:51,070 --> 02:34:56,070
This is suicide music.
Now there's a bad jam.

3311
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:58,000
This tie rod,
this tremendous.

3312
02:34:58,690 --> 02:34:59,523
Yeah.
This is one of those songs you listened 

3313
02:35:00,461 --> 02:35:05,461
to over your grandmother's house.
To get outside for a walk is a bad jam.

3314
02:35:06,550 --> 02:35:09,460
I got to get out of the house guys.
A fucking snowing out.

3315
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:11,530
I don't care.
I got to walk.

3316
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:14,020
Going to be dressing an eagle.
Thinks is a bird.

3317
02:35:14,320 --> 02:35:15,153
You have to see this guy now.
I always wonder what happens to these 

3318
02:35:18,490 --> 02:35:21,190
guys are like rock stars and then they 
just stopped.

3319
02:35:22,060 --> 02:35:23,120
They just stopped.
Like,

3320
02:35:23,121 --> 02:35:25,750
what is guaranteed?
This guy had so much talent.

3321
02:35:25,751 --> 02:35:28,340
This guy wrote for people.
He gets a fucking.

3322
02:35:28,390 --> 02:35:31,000
He gets residuals from all this dough on
the radio,

3323
02:35:31,370 --> 02:35:33,400
you know,
with all this classic rock and all these

3324
02:35:33,401 --> 02:35:37,180
serious and the same money we get from.
What's that check?

3325
02:35:37,181 --> 02:35:40,540
Which sends us a check once a quarter 
for our shit on the radio they got.

3326
02:35:41,140 --> 02:35:43,480
And the in boulder.
I used to be friends with a guy that was

3327
02:35:43,481 --> 02:35:46,210
a radio police.
Okay.

3328
02:35:46,211 --> 02:35:47,044
He was the radio police and what he did 
was he made sure that you got paid for 

3329
02:35:50,771 --> 02:35:52,450
your stuff.
The radio.

3330
02:35:52,460 --> 02:35:54,310
Polly was there.
He worked for the radio.

3331
02:35:54,311 --> 02:35:56,310
Police have a badge.
No,

3332
02:35:56,330 --> 02:35:59,680
he dad.
He was a white guy at the car wash.

3333
02:36:00,070 --> 02:36:01,150
What's in here?
Keurig?

3334
02:36:01,180 --> 02:36:03,220
K Cups.
Hash oil.

3335
02:36:03,700 --> 02:36:04,533
Marijuana and the K Cup for him.
I got to put some sugar in this 

3336
02:36:06,881 --> 02:36:07,651
motherfucker.
You Ain't,

3337
02:36:07,651 --> 02:36:11,530
you don't like sweet enough.
The universe experience.

3338
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:12,780
Very sweet.
No.

3339
02:36:12,800 --> 02:36:16,120
Uh,
but we told Stevie is empty.

3340
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:18,870
Have you tried the liquid Stevia stuff?
We got Marvin.

3341
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:20,830
Oh,
we got sugar for you.

3342
02:36:20,890 --> 02:36:23,950
Y'all take some sugar.
Liquid Stevia.

3343
02:36:24,460 --> 02:36:26,720
That's dangerous.
Eyedropper yet second hand.

3344
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:29,740
Let's do like a one or two drops.
It's so strong.

3345
02:36:29,741 --> 02:36:32,200
Stevia can really fuck up a drink if 
you're not paying attention.

3346
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:33,730
Hello?
It's me.

3347
02:36:33,880 --> 02:36:34,960
Yeah.
Well,

3348
02:36:34,961 --> 02:36:36,760
you know the fuck.
What's he gonna do?

3349
02:36:37,540 --> 02:36:39,250
What's this sugar bitch?
I got.

3350
02:36:39,390 --> 02:36:40,870
I'm Cuban.
I got a sweet tooth.

3351
02:36:40,871 --> 02:36:42,850
You're going to get me two packages.
I got diabetes.

3352
02:36:42,851 --> 02:36:46,300
How many packets to use?
Raw Sugar.

3353
02:36:46,330 --> 02:36:48,130
How many agents?
A half a cup of coffee.

3354
02:36:48,131 --> 02:36:49,480
How many sugars would you put it in 
there?

3355
02:36:49,481 --> 02:36:50,380
Normally?
I don't.

3356
02:36:50,381 --> 02:36:51,214
Fucking raw sugars.
Kinda wasn't that Stevia's shit in 

3357
02:36:53,951 --> 02:36:55,060
there.
Now it's broken.

3358
02:36:55,090 --> 02:36:55,840
No,
the other shit.

3359
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:57,870
That's what I use.
I use the sister sweetness.

3360
02:36:59,140 --> 02:37:01,580
Your boy sent me Stevia.
Whatever the fuck.

3361
02:37:01,610 --> 02:37:02,443
He said sugar at all.
But yet you're using for the fuck you 

3362
02:37:08,921 --> 02:37:10,650
guys.
I'm partying with you motherfuckers.

3363
02:37:10,690 --> 02:37:12,090
You know what I'm saying?
We all partied.

3364
02:37:12,100 --> 02:37:12,933
Once you drink that,
you drink that fucking one of the atlas 

3365
02:37:16,840 --> 02:37:19,010
and I did my first morning joining the 
9:00

3366
02:37:19,010 --> 02:37:20,180
AM.
This is what the fuck you been.

3367
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:21,500
Oh,
I wanted to talk to you about that.

3368
02:37:21,770 --> 02:37:26,770
Your periscope show your stairs for Joe 
and I got it.

3369
02:37:27,130 --> 02:37:27,771
I'm good.
I'm good.

3370
02:37:27,771 --> 02:37:30,520
This tastes like this.
Tastes like.

3371
02:37:31,420 --> 02:37:33,650
I don't know what the fuck you talking 
about.

3372
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:38,210
It's not supposed to be good.
When I drank a star.

3373
02:37:38,211 --> 02:37:39,280
It's fucking good.
It's Gel.

3374
02:37:39,281 --> 02:37:40,880
Drink that.
This is Dick.

3375
02:37:40,910 --> 02:37:41,743
No,
no.

3376
02:37:43,870 --> 02:37:45,950
Taste like a guy that smoked pot all 
night.

3377
02:37:45,951 --> 02:37:50,951
You suck his dick.
Get Salad Queen.

3378
02:37:54,410 --> 02:37:55,670
Hello?
It's me.

3379
02:37:56,960 --> 02:38:00,500
What's the story you periscope show you 
every morning you do in the joint?

3380
02:38:00,650 --> 02:38:01,483
What does it say it again?
Tell me about the morning joint with 

3381
02:38:03,011 --> 02:38:03,844
Uncle Joey.
About.

3382
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:07,850
I do it about five after the baby lets 
me go after eight in the morning.

3383
02:38:07,851 --> 02:38:08,684
Yeah.
You stand outside for a couple of 

3384
02:38:09,370 --> 02:38:12,350
minutes and just do pairs for me for 
both two different weeds,

3385
02:38:12,351 --> 02:38:15,530
maybe a little hashish and I wake the 
people up.

3386
02:38:15,531 --> 02:38:16,364
I give some motivational times.
I tell the people at grabbed that Dick 

3387
02:38:18,441 --> 02:38:21,290
like today,
the saying of the day was either they're

3388
02:38:21,291 --> 02:38:23,330
going to suck your dick or they're going
to suck your Dick.

3389
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:24,710
Either way you wouldn't.
You know what I'm saying?

3390
02:38:25,850 --> 02:38:26,930
Wow.
That's really clever.

3391
02:38:26,931 --> 02:38:28,240
Did you write that out?
Sure.

3392
02:38:28,250 --> 02:38:31,370
And Confucius says you suck my dick 
today or something,

3393
02:38:32,030 --> 02:38:34,220
but you got to suck my dick somewhere 
along the line,

3394
02:38:34,390 --> 02:38:35,223
Dick second going,
how you have to leave the house in the 

3395
02:38:37,101 --> 02:38:38,510
morning when I leave the house,
I'm scared.

3396
02:38:38,511 --> 02:38:42,410
I got fucking get myself fired up in the
shower and let people know that when I'm

3397
02:38:42,411 --> 02:38:43,244
going out that somebody is going to suck
your dick play whether they want to not 

3398
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:47,320
be scared of.
No,

3399
02:38:47,330 --> 02:38:48,420
I'm scared of fucking.

3400
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:51,710
Do you ever have them delete any of your
stuff?

3401
02:38:52,770 --> 02:38:53,930
No,
not about periscope.

3402
02:38:53,931 --> 02:38:55,820
I just do them and I fucking move on 
with my life.

3403
02:38:56,050 --> 02:38:58,130
That'd be alive.
They will visit.

3404
02:38:58,950 --> 02:39:02,200
You're showing up with some mad 
motherfucking sunshine in your heart.

3405
02:39:02,670 --> 02:39:03,470
Ball sack.

3406
02:39:03,470 --> 02:39:04,303
Yeah.

3407
02:39:04,870 --> 02:39:07,000
They had said they got two options.
Study the suck.

3408
02:39:07,001 --> 02:39:08,170
Good Dick Quarter.
Suck.

3409
02:39:08,171 --> 02:39:09,340
Good Dick.
That's their option.

3410
02:39:09,341 --> 02:39:12,950
So who gives a fuck?
What's up with the Janet?

3411
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:13,793
Janet,
you know we've been waiting for 20 

3412
02:39:14,711 --> 02:39:15,544
fucking minutes now.
You want to show up a day late and a 

3413
02:39:16,721 --> 02:39:17,554
dollar short,
but let's get this fucking party 

3414
02:39:19,661 --> 02:39:21,610
started.
We're going to open up today with the,

3415
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:22,570
with the Zombie.
We.

3416
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:23,553
By the way,

3417
02:39:27,130 --> 02:39:31,950
I know exactly what I'm doing tomorrow.
I'm setting my alarm clock and I'm going

3418
02:39:31,951 --> 02:39:34,260
to be a part of this.
I usually watch you right when I'm going

3419
02:39:34,261 --> 02:39:39,261
to bed really early sometimes.
Sometimes you know what I'm going to do,

3420
02:39:39,781 --> 02:39:41,730
man.
I want to get one of those iphone things

3421
02:39:41,731 --> 02:39:44,760
for the car.
You know you got one that illegal.

3422
02:39:47,190 --> 02:39:48,023
It's illegal to do it on the have a 
windshield mountain in California 

3423
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:51,713
windshield windshield because it's in 
front of you or anything on your 

3424
02:39:53,941 --> 02:39:55,710
windshield.
So you can do that on the windshield.

3425
02:39:56,350 --> 02:39:58,560
You know,
you could do it like on the fence.

3426
02:39:58,590 --> 02:40:00,130
They have the ones that snap and events 
and.

3427
02:40:00,590 --> 02:40:01,423
But it's not,
it's not illegal at periscope while 

3428
02:40:02,341 --> 02:40:03,330
you're driving.
I think it is.

3429
02:40:03,450 --> 02:40:05,220
I definitely think it is.
Really.

3430
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:06,113
Yeah.
Because you're kind of not paying 

3431
02:40:06,931 --> 02:40:07,764
attention to the road you are.
If you just turn it on while you're 

3432
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:10,920
driving.
If you're parked,

3433
02:40:10,950 --> 02:40:12,240
he turned it on and you go,
okay,

3434
02:40:12,241 --> 02:40:13,070
it's on.
Here we go.

3435
02:40:13,070 --> 02:40:13,980
We're going to work.
I think

3436
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:15,460
that's the biggest step you can take.
That's fine.

3437
02:40:15,660 --> 02:40:18,360
You can drive like that with Gopros 
because that's how those shows get made.

3438
02:40:18,770 --> 02:40:21,360
Like drive that drive channel on 
Youtube.

3439
02:40:21,420 --> 02:40:23,760
I was with those guys that Matt Farah 
Dude,

3440
02:40:23,761 --> 02:40:25,310
he's got all these gopros inside of his 
car.

3441
02:40:25,320 --> 02:40:26,340
So you could definitely do that.

3442
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:27,330
I uh,
I,

3443
02:40:27,400 --> 02:40:30,410
I drive all the time but I delete them 
right after that.

3444
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:33,113
Cloud is shit.
The fucking forest fire fighting 30 

3445
02:40:46,290 --> 02:40:47,123
1:00,

3446
02:40:47,610 --> 02:40:48,443
they deleted one of my periscopes 
because I have this thing where I eat 

3447
02:40:51,990 --> 02:40:55,650
shitty food in the shower and like 
review it and I was doing Taco Bell,

3448
02:40:55,830 --> 02:40:56,663
like I had like a Nacho Belgrade day and
I was just drinking all the water and 

3449
02:40:59,011 --> 02:41:01,770
like,
like a soup I got deleted because it was

3450
02:41:01,771 --> 02:41:03,150
too gross.
I think.

3451
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:06,650
What the fuck you eating food.
I know they censoring.

3452
02:41:06,680 --> 02:41:07,470
They,
I think they might,

3453
02:41:07,470 --> 02:41:08,303
I don't know why,
but it was available for like an hour 

3454
02:41:10,231 --> 02:41:12,270
and then they just pulled it and I don't
know if it was.

3455
02:41:12,330 --> 02:41:14,550
I heard that people have said at you 
that you're wasting water.

3456
02:41:15,490 --> 02:41:18,510
Six minute shower and I'm taking a 
shower while I'm eating.

3457
02:41:18,980 --> 02:41:19,813
Yeah.
But you're not defending or attacking 

3458
02:41:22,351 --> 02:41:22,770
you.
Right?

3459
02:41:22,770 --> 02:41:24,330
People were upset that you were wasting 
water.

3460
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:25,740
Well,
I understand those complaints,

3461
02:41:25,741 --> 02:41:26,520
but I,
uh,

3462
02:41:26,520 --> 02:41:28,840
when I,
when I do a periscope,

3463
02:41:28,860 --> 02:41:31,170
I tried not to shower for four days 
straight.

3464
02:41:31,171 --> 02:41:31,920
So,
uh,

3465
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:33,570
it's uh,
can argue with that.

3466
02:41:33,571 --> 02:41:34,404
Ladies and gentlemen,

3467
02:41:34,600 --> 02:41:37,680
show off your fucking high horse.
How many minutes shower can I take?

3468
02:41:37,790 --> 02:41:38,623
What?
Five minutes?

3469
02:41:38,830 --> 02:41:39,663
Ten minutes ago,
who fucking shuts down the golf course 

3470
02:41:41,431 --> 02:41:43,110
and when does that happen?
Because until then,

3471
02:41:43,111 --> 02:41:43,944
fuck yourself,
because they're using millions of 

3472
02:41:45,450 --> 02:41:47,460
gallons of water until you shut down the
golf course.

3473
02:41:47,670 --> 02:41:50,340
Fuck off.
That's 100 percent for entertainment.

3474
02:41:50,420 --> 02:41:53,670
A hundred hundred percent.
He's at least taken a convert.

3475
02:41:53,671 --> 02:41:56,250
Tory effort of entertainment and a 
shower.

3476
02:41:56,340 --> 02:41:58,980
I take two or three shows a day and I 
take my time.

3477
02:41:59,010 --> 02:42:01,680
I get the slew foot.
Nice to get the asshole.

3478
02:42:01,681 --> 02:42:03,240
Get the fuck you have to live with a 
stick.

3479
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:04,740
That's.
I made an asshole.

3480
02:42:04,741 --> 02:42:07,320
Loofa dog.
A little looser with acute tip.

3481
02:42:07,800 --> 02:42:09,920
Just don't wash the barnacles around the
muffler.

3482
02:42:11,390 --> 02:42:14,280
Get stuck in there and you won't even 
know until I did the colonoscopy.

3483
02:42:14,281 --> 02:42:15,114
I looked at my ad.
I didn't want to go with they with a 

3484
02:42:15,870 --> 02:42:16,140
dirty.

3485
02:42:16,140 --> 02:42:16,973
Yeah.
So just use the shower for your 

3486
02:42:18,151 --> 02:42:20,100
colonoscopy.
Cocksucker.

3487
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:21,350
I've had a finger in my butt.
No,

3488
02:42:21,390 --> 02:42:22,780
not the finger.
When they stick the camera,

3489
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:24,400
look around.
Dr.

3490
02:42:24,540 --> 02:42:26,220
a check around.
They had to look around.

3491
02:42:26,730 --> 02:42:28,320
Very uncomfortable.
Very uncomfortable.

3492
02:42:28,350 --> 02:42:29,021
Yeah.
They really are.

3493
02:42:29,021 --> 02:42:31,260
Make icon.
Look around your asshole.

3494
02:42:33,150 --> 02:42:35,580
Yeah,
I'm avoiding shoulder surgery.

3495
02:42:36,030 --> 02:42:39,360
I've got some tears,
small pairs in my labor,

3496
02:42:39,900 --> 02:42:42,120
so I've been going through a regena 
keen,

3497
02:42:42,121 --> 02:42:44,310
had physical therapy and all this 
different shit for it.

3498
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:48,450
So my latest health issue,
it's fascinating.

3499
02:42:48,451 --> 02:42:49,284
Shit.
The feel your joints given out and to 

3500
02:42:51,361 --> 02:42:52,194
realize,
oh,

3501
02:42:52,400 --> 02:42:55,140
I didn't have to get fixed.
I'm gonna have to get this one fixed.

3502
02:42:55,260 --> 02:42:57,540
It's not quite at the point where I got 
to get it fixed.

3503
02:42:57,541 --> 02:43:00,010
I think I could rejuvenate it to the 
point like it's.

3504
02:43:00,011 --> 02:43:00,844
It's weird because it's still strong but
it just gets sore after I use it and 

3505
02:43:03,661 --> 02:43:07,530
there's apparently some bone chips in 
there from Jujitsu for my knee hurts,

3506
02:43:07,531 --> 02:43:11,320
but what Americaness going to cry,
I'm going to knee hurts again.

3507
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:12,690
The one I just had.
You should.

3508
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:14,140
You should look into that.
Regina.

3509
02:43:14,141 --> 02:43:17,650
King Shit was with Jenna came magenic 
kings or the bloods spinning procedure.

3510
02:43:17,651 --> 02:43:18,484
They take your blood outs with coby 
Bryan and all these guys used to go to 

3511
02:43:20,410 --> 02:43:21,243
Germany for now they have a place in 
Santa Monica and it just massive and 

3512
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:29,410
they take out some blood.
That's where we have a problem.

3513
02:43:29,880 --> 02:43:32,600
They to whatever,
to busy,

3514
02:43:32,610 --> 02:43:35,680
you got to know they've got a few to 
know they need and they're big too.

3515
02:43:36,220 --> 02:43:37,053
They're taken too big tubes and a couple
of small to get that bass drum and 

3516
02:43:40,180 --> 02:43:43,010
fucking compressor and they fucking 
banged it out of him.

3517
02:43:43,030 --> 02:43:45,310
Blood flopped you.
That's why I didn't go to the thing.

3518
02:43:45,370 --> 02:43:50,290
The Salvation Army.
Sixteen ounces of blood of your blood.

3519
02:43:50,291 --> 02:43:52,880
They've got to go.
You've been doing and I try.

3520
02:43:53,410 --> 02:43:54,243
I try to give blood.
Once a month I go to a doctor with some 

3521
02:43:57,581 --> 02:43:59,800
fake fucking excuse because people.

3522
02:43:59,800 --> 02:44:02,470
That's why women don't get heart attacks
because they bleed once a month.

3523
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:04,180
Why?
Why?

3524
02:44:05,370 --> 02:44:06,203
They change up their fucking blood.
That's why women don't get audited 

3525
02:44:11,430 --> 02:44:12,263
because every fucking blood,
but we don't bleed like women go get 

3526
02:44:17,950 --> 02:44:18,783
blood.
So your body rejuvenates new fucking 

3527
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:21,990
blood.
Even if it's for fucking announces.

3528
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:23,680
What do you think it dealing with?
Because that was true.

3529
02:44:23,681 --> 02:44:24,431
Then dudes,
you did.

3530
02:44:24,431 --> 02:44:27,130
Coke would bleed more than noses,
so they would probably live longer.

3531
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:28,353
You talked on them about telling you 
right now that the reason women don't 

3532
02:44:31,091 --> 02:44:31,924
die as many audit taxes matters because 
they don't believe that the fucking 

3533
02:44:34,310 --> 02:44:35,143
monkey,
the reason why they probably don't die 

3534
02:44:36,581 --> 02:44:38,050
as much because they don't date as many 
women.

3535
02:44:38,120 --> 02:44:40,160
If you're over 40,
go give blood once a month.

3536
02:44:40,161 --> 02:44:42,370
Just a couple tubes so your body starts 
from scratch.

3537
02:44:42,371 --> 02:44:43,204
I'm telling you,
Joe wrote when women are not dating 

3538
02:44:45,191 --> 02:44:46,630
women,
it saves a lot of stress.

3539
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:48,690
It's good point and I thought this gay 
marriage thing,

3540
02:44:48,700 --> 02:44:53,700
you're gonna see a rise in heart attacks
on women once they get the bill from the

3541
02:44:54,761 --> 02:44:55,780
lawyer,
the alimony.

3542
02:44:55,781 --> 02:45:00,160
What fucking out bitch get a job.
I didn't get breakfast.

3543
02:45:00,740 --> 02:45:03,790
You didn't have fucking kids with me.
God dammit.

3544
02:45:04,180 --> 02:45:06,220
Melissa etheridge was really funny when 
she was talking about that.

3545
02:45:06,221 --> 02:45:08,740
She gives alimony two different checks.
I go,

3546
02:45:08,741 --> 02:45:09,640
what happened?
She goes,

3547
02:45:09,940 --> 02:45:10,773
bitches are crazy.

3548
02:45:14,830 --> 02:45:19,830
Child support is a bad ass bitch.
She's a lady.

3549
02:45:22,490 --> 02:45:23,323
I say that with all due respect,
I call you a bad aspect so I can call 

3550
02:45:25,661 --> 02:45:27,370
anybody I love about ass.
Bitch.

3551
02:45:27,400 --> 02:45:28,780
Look at you.
Bad ass bitch.

3552
02:45:28,980 --> 02:45:30,910
That's,
that's 100 percent respectful.

3553
02:45:31,190 --> 02:45:33,250
Where are you at this weekend?
You suck the data.

3554
02:45:33,360 --> 02:45:34,193
Just see,
um,

3555
02:45:34,300 --> 02:45:35,133
the car theater at the mgm with Tommy 
[inaudible] and Tony Hinchcliffe in 

3556
02:45:38,351 --> 02:45:41,080
Vegas for the big fights.
I'm gonna miss you guys.

3557
02:45:41,310 --> 02:45:42,430
I miss you too.
Where are you at?

3558
02:45:42,431 --> 02:45:45,850
I'm at the Atlanta impro.
I heard that's a good spot by spot.

3559
02:45:45,851 --> 02:45:48,280
Brian Campbell's a king.
He's a king there.

3560
02:45:48,360 --> 02:45:49,193
Yup.
That's,

3561
02:45:49,240 --> 02:45:53,620
they don't have the punchline anymore,
but they did a punchline comedy night at

3562
02:45:53,621 --> 02:45:57,220
a fucking backyard the other day.
They had some gated community.

3563
02:45:57,221 --> 02:46:00,190
They have some crazy community and um,
and uh,

3564
02:46:00,220 --> 02:46:01,053
somewhere outside of Atlanta.
It's like one of those engineered 

3565
02:46:02,651 --> 02:46:06,010
communities and they have all these 
recreations and gated community,

3566
02:46:06,160 --> 02:46:06,993
but they have this,
the punchline had a punchline comedy 

3567
02:46:09,471 --> 02:46:10,304
night and all these people are sitting 
outside and they decided to have a 

3568
02:46:12,381 --> 02:46:13,560
comedy night at their,
uh,

3569
02:46:13,760 --> 02:46:15,200
you say the punchline is not open 
anymore.

3570
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:15,830
It's on open.
What happened?

3571
02:46:15,830 --> 02:46:19,100
What they did to the building?
I think they lost their lease,

3572
02:46:19,580 --> 02:46:20,413
I'm assuming,
but they've been there for ever forever 

3573
02:46:23,300 --> 02:46:26,150
or they might've decided it doesn't make
sense to keep the lease.

3574
02:46:26,151 --> 02:46:29,540
I don't know exactly what happened and 
they're looking for another spot.

3575
02:46:29,590 --> 02:46:30,560
Greenroom sucked.
Anyway.

3576
02:46:31,250 --> 02:46:32,810
No,
I was kind of cool.

3577
02:46:33,260 --> 02:46:35,720
That was the green room that had a 
little sign on the wall and said,

3578
02:46:35,721 --> 02:46:36,930
quit trying to be Hicks.
Yeah,

3579
02:46:37,920 --> 02:46:40,880
got trapped there because you had the 
only way to enter and exit.

3580
02:46:40,881 --> 02:46:43,550
That green room was walking through the 
whole entire audience.

3581
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:48,470
That's also the green room where Seth 
Petrocelli Fuck Kimbo slice and I called

3582
02:46:48,471 --> 02:46:52,760
the fight like right before it happened 
because Ken shamrock got injured warming

3583
02:46:52,761 --> 02:46:56,920
up for the first fight and then all of a
sudden instead of Ken Kimbo slice out of

3584
02:46:56,921 --> 02:46:58,250
fight seth pictures,
Ellie and I went,

3585
02:46:58,251 --> 02:46:59,084
what?

3586
02:46:59,480 --> 02:47:00,530
And as soon as I saw it,
I'm like,

3587
02:47:00,560 --> 02:47:02,630
oh my God says package.
I was going to fuck him up.

3588
02:47:02,631 --> 02:47:04,700
Like this is a terrible fight for him.
Petros.

3589
02:47:04,780 --> 02:47:07,550
Ellie's a bad motherfucker.
So I watched that.

3590
02:47:07,551 --> 02:47:09,300
I was like,
this is a terrible match up.

3591
02:47:09,470 --> 02:47:10,760
And everybody's like,
you're crazy.

3592
02:47:10,761 --> 02:47:12,490
Kimball's a world beater and like,
dude,

3593
02:47:12,500 --> 02:47:14,510
you wait,
do you see what happens here?

3594
02:47:14,630 --> 02:47:16,550
And it happened within like eight 
seconds.

3595
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:20,630
Just as soon as the fight started,
Petrocelli knocks him out and I go see.

3596
02:47:20,720 --> 02:47:22,230
I called it south patches.
Oh,

3597
02:47:22,231 --> 02:47:23,750
he's bad motherfucker.
But I was like,

3598
02:47:23,751 --> 02:47:25,520
but I didn't call it.
You would never see this.

3599
02:47:25,730 --> 02:47:27,110
This would,
we would hide this.

3600
02:47:28,570 --> 02:47:29,960
It was a crazy little green room,
man.

3601
02:47:30,200 --> 02:47:31,550
That was a good little spot.
Yeah.

3602
02:47:31,580 --> 02:47:34,640
I mean just walking to the back door or 
something to it.

3603
02:47:34,710 --> 02:47:35,750
Yeah.
Walking suck.

3604
02:47:35,751 --> 02:47:38,570
But that was part of the fun of that 
club was that it was kind of Wonky,

3605
02:47:38,900 --> 02:47:40,130
you know?
Is that weird?

3606
02:47:40,131 --> 02:47:43,460
Wonky upstairs member.
So weird spot know show.

3607
02:47:43,461 --> 02:47:45,490
It wasn't manly.
Beard got goddamn growing.

3608
02:47:45,510 --> 02:47:47,720
Another beard.
I always done a slug.

3609
02:47:47,800 --> 02:47:50,330
I thought that was that.

3610
02:47:50,440 --> 02:47:53,310
I always die.
This would now guaranteed.

3611
02:47:53,311 --> 02:47:54,640
And people know what the fuck you're 
doing.

3612
02:47:54,880 --> 02:47:56,960
When I used to bring you there,
people don't know what to make of you on

3613
02:47:57,190 --> 02:47:58,023
there were so confused when you were in 
his position back then were either they 

3614
02:48:03,611 --> 02:48:07,550
got it or they didn't know,
but I wasn't working hard than either.

3615
02:48:07,690 --> 02:48:12,430
I was going up that coat up like the 
night before and not even feeling that,

3616
02:48:13,510 --> 02:48:14,343
you know,
when you have coke and get blood from 

3617
02:48:15,811 --> 02:48:18,040
the night before dog does it depress 
you?

3618
02:48:18,041 --> 02:48:20,730
The next day wasn't the depression.
It's like,

3619
02:48:20,770 --> 02:48:21,650
you know,
you got high,

3620
02:48:21,740 --> 02:48:24,160
like I would get high like Mondays,
Wednesdays,

3621
02:48:24,190 --> 02:48:27,280
then the fucking weekend coach coming,
you got a walmart,

3622
02:48:27,370 --> 02:48:28,203
you know,
and the first night you'd have like a 

3623
02:48:29,591 --> 02:48:31,630
good show.
There is nothing to have a good show.

3624
02:48:31,631 --> 02:48:32,464
But then I got ahold of that shit and 
then Friday was rough and then Saturday 

3625
02:48:35,620 --> 02:48:37,660
was even referred because you're more,
you're more,

3626
02:48:37,661 --> 02:48:39,170
this communicated,
you're more.

3627
02:48:39,620 --> 02:48:44,620
This disconnected is the word.
So I would go up that dying to see those

3628
02:48:45,071 --> 02:48:47,980
people and I fucking hated them and they
hated me.

3629
02:48:47,981 --> 02:48:48,820
You know?
It was a.

3630
02:48:49,630 --> 02:48:52,990
So for the longest time for you that 
cocaine was a real,

3631
02:48:53,140 --> 02:48:56,800
like a real anchor around your neck.
Thirty fucking years.

3632
02:48:56,801 --> 02:48:58,870
I was telling my wife this morning,
the whole nineties.

3633
02:48:59,280 --> 02:49:01,000
You figure the whole nine these.
How'd you.

3634
02:49:01,060 --> 02:49:02,840
How'd you kick it?
Kick it.

3635
02:49:03,130 --> 02:49:04,990
Told you I just kicked it.
I don't fucking know.

3636
02:49:05,860 --> 02:49:09,180
I guess I just didn't want.
I didn't want listening bro.

3637
02:49:09,181 --> 02:49:11,130
Like I told you my.
I have a fucking revenge.

3638
02:49:12,450 --> 02:49:13,920
Okay.
It,

3639
02:49:14,400 --> 02:49:17,520
you'd rather fucking get 10 takes up 
your ass.

3640
02:49:18,030 --> 02:49:19,380
Didn't have somebody come to you and 
say,

3641
02:49:19,381 --> 02:49:22,350
Joey Diaz died from an overdose.
I was not going to let that happen.

3642
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:24,900
I was not going to let people come up to
you and go see.

3643
02:49:24,900 --> 02:49:25,733
I told you and I definitely didn't want 
my wife to find me on the floor 

3644
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:31,110
listening.
You can find me on the floor.

3645
02:49:31,140 --> 02:49:33,930
Red Band could never handle red band 
will never be the same again.

3646
02:49:33,931 --> 02:49:36,090
If he found me on the floor,
never read,

3647
02:49:36,091 --> 02:49:39,980
Bam would fucking God because he doesn't
have that DNA.

3648
02:49:40,060 --> 02:49:42,780
This poor guy you do you to find anybody
on the floor.

3649
02:49:43,170 --> 02:49:46,740
It'd be tough for you to deal with the 
league about that.

3650
02:49:46,810 --> 02:49:48,810
It'd be tough for you to deal.
You are strong.

3651
02:49:48,811 --> 02:49:49,644
You know what I'm saying?
You would put it in perspective a lot 

3652
02:49:51,331 --> 02:49:52,270
quicker.
Little Red Bag.

3653
02:49:52,310 --> 02:49:54,900
Could red band would take two years 
talking about.

3654
02:49:54,940 --> 02:49:55,980
I'm like,
he's not right there.

3655
02:49:57,250 --> 02:50:01,230
Not saying something bad about red band 
with bands.

3656
02:50:01,231 --> 02:50:03,930
Got a great soul.
When I first met red band,

3657
02:50:03,931 --> 02:50:05,700
I would talk to this kid would leave the
room.

3658
02:50:05,730 --> 02:50:07,940
They didn't know what to make of the 
Columbus days.

3659
02:50:08,150 --> 02:50:09,220
Yeah.
When I first.

3660
02:50:09,310 --> 02:50:10,143
He didn't know.
So what I'm saying is that some people 

3661
02:50:12,330 --> 02:50:13,163
could find a guy on the floor and live 
with it and there's some people who 

3662
02:50:15,960 --> 02:50:17,890
can't digest it.
They can't.

3663
02:50:18,240 --> 02:50:21,120
I didn't want to things I didn't want to
terrify me on the floor.

3664
02:50:21,360 --> 02:50:24,000
I definitely don't want to die in a 
hotel room on the fucking road.

3665
02:50:24,930 --> 02:50:25,763
And that was my main playground.
You know what I'm gonna go get a hotel 

3666
02:50:28,981 --> 02:50:32,940
room.
Naked juice on your leg hopefully.

3667
02:50:33,020 --> 02:50:36,150
And some chick who left at three in the 
morning and then people going to say,

3668
02:50:36,151 --> 02:50:36,984
I told you Joe Rogan,
that was never going to happen in my 

3669
02:50:38,881 --> 02:50:40,800
lifetime.
In my lifetime.

3670
02:50:40,801 --> 02:50:43,170
That was not going to happen.
I was not going to hold me from cope.

3671
02:50:43,470 --> 02:50:46,650
I couldn't give them the satisfaction.
Even after the fucking fact.

3672
02:50:46,650 --> 02:50:50,910
That's how deep my revenge genome runs.
That's hilarious.

3673
02:50:50,911 --> 02:50:51,810
So you,
you,

3674
02:50:51,860 --> 02:50:56,250
you got clean because you wanted to get 
back at the people.

3675
02:50:56,251 --> 02:50:57,840
That would be.
It would have been happy.

3676
02:50:57,841 --> 02:50:58,674
If you die,
I'll place would have been happy if I 

3677
02:51:00,031 --> 02:51:00,864
died from that.
They would have loved to look at you in 

3678
02:51:02,701 --> 02:51:05,700
the face and go.
I told yourself there's people that live

3679
02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:08,190
for that shit that once they have an 
opinion,

3680
02:51:08,191 --> 02:51:09,940
they live by.
Let me tell you something now.

3681
02:51:10,350 --> 02:51:11,540
I said,
I told you.

3682
02:51:11,541 --> 02:51:15,240
Sell a Shitload of times.
Now I get to say I told you so.

3683
02:51:15,241 --> 02:51:16,970
Now I get to say I told you.
So.

3684
02:51:16,971 --> 02:51:19,440
It's a lot of fucking agents.
I've had some.

3685
02:51:20,280 --> 02:51:23,370
I had some stupid conversations with 
people back in the day,

3686
02:51:23,430 --> 02:51:25,470
stupid where they're trying to tell him 
you were in town to,

3687
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:26,460
if you weren't funny.
I'm like,

3688
02:51:26,461 --> 02:51:27,470
you need to shut the fuck up.

3689
02:51:27,470 --> 02:51:29,070
I was just talking about,
listen man,

3690
02:51:29,071 --> 02:51:31,170
when you're on the drug,
when you're running a drug,

3691
02:51:32,340 --> 02:51:33,173
you get stuck in that emotional state 
where you started that drug with that 

3692
02:51:35,641 --> 02:51:37,590
drug really became something else for 
you.

3693
02:51:37,620 --> 02:51:38,460
Listen,
when we do,

3694
02:51:38,700 --> 02:51:39,533
when I go right when I leave now and I 
go to the pharmacist and I get such a 

3695
02:51:42,450 --> 02:51:44,490
great hit,
one out of all three times,

3696
02:51:44,620 --> 02:51:46,460
it's an antibody kind of ours,
uh,

3697
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:48,280
steroids,
steroids to get the burn pit.

3698
02:51:48,320 --> 02:51:48,961
Oh,
okay.

3699
02:51:48,961 --> 02:51:49,950
I've heard of that.
Okay?

3700
02:51:49,951 --> 02:51:52,050
But once I started saying that,
that thing,

3701
02:51:52,080 --> 02:51:52,913
then it becomes something else.
Why don't check started coming up to me 

3702
02:51:54,361 --> 02:51:55,010
and going,
God,

3703
02:51:55,010 --> 02:51:57,960
we love your arms and we'd love your 
backup becomes an emotional thing.

3704
02:51:58,390 --> 02:51:59,223
Shooting,
shooting.

3705
02:51:59,280 --> 02:52:01,350
Right now I'm starting.
I'm chasing that dragon.

3706
02:52:01,351 --> 02:52:02,770
That feeling.
Well,

3707
02:52:02,780 --> 02:52:03,613
when you start doing,
you do a fucking line of coke because 

3708
02:52:05,321 --> 02:52:06,070
you're in an emotional

3709
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:07,630
fucking wrecked.
Okay?

3710
02:52:07,631 --> 02:52:08,464
When you do it,
you don't even know what at times you 

3711
02:52:09,641 --> 02:52:11,920
become an emotional wreck from any drug,
those pills.

3712
02:52:12,340 --> 02:52:13,480
So for me,
I stopped.

3713
02:52:13,481 --> 02:52:16,600
I got stuck emotionally.
The angle was stuck in me.

3714
02:52:16,601 --> 02:52:17,434
You can't move forward.
We've had this discussion can move 

3715
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:19,821
forward.
Well,

3716
02:52:19,821 --> 02:52:20,910
you've always said that it,
like,

3717
02:52:20,950 --> 02:52:23,020
it shuts off your soul.
Show it.

3718
02:52:23,790 --> 02:52:24,623
That's the way you described it.
It was like you just became a blank 

3719
02:52:26,920 --> 02:52:28,300
shirt.
I wasn't happy.

3720
02:52:28,390 --> 02:52:30,130
I wasn't sad.
I wasn't mad.

3721
02:52:30,131 --> 02:52:32,180
I wasn't any of the above.
I had no emotions.

3722
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:36,760
You fake the funk in away in those days.
You still were.

3723
02:52:36,780 --> 02:52:37,441
Joey did.
Oh,

3724
02:52:37,441 --> 02:52:38,274
I can still grow some fucking eat if you
caught me after two days if I sat down 

3725
02:52:42,371 --> 02:52:44,920
with a notebook.
But it wasn't until you know,

3726
02:52:44,921 --> 02:52:45,481
you,
you,

3727
02:52:45,481 --> 02:52:47,450
you still had a lot of talent.
You know,

3728
02:52:47,530 --> 02:52:51,130
there's still something about you that,
that just,

3729
02:52:51,300 --> 02:52:52,031
it,
it was about,

3730
02:52:52,031 --> 02:52:52,864
uh,
you catching it.

3731
02:52:52,930 --> 02:52:53,960
I remember one time we,
uh,

3732
02:52:53,980 --> 02:52:57,190
we worked together rascals,
the West Orange,

3733
02:52:57,220 --> 02:53:02,220
western rascals and wants to orange.
And it was at the time when you made the

3734
02:53:02,801 --> 02:53:03,634
transition,
you know how Nicole or Caitlyn Jenner 

3735
02:53:06,640 --> 02:53:07,810
came,
that was a transition.

3736
02:53:07,990 --> 02:53:11,110
There was a transition where you went 
from Joey Diaz,

3737
02:53:11,260 --> 02:53:13,620
the guy wants to be a comedian to Joey 
Diaz,

3738
02:53:13,640 --> 02:53:15,020
a great comedian.
And then I saw,

3739
02:53:15,021 --> 02:53:16,930
I watched it happen and it happened 
really quickly.

3740
02:53:17,170 --> 02:53:18,760
That was what was weird.
I was like,

3741
02:53:18,761 --> 02:53:21,040
you have this period of time.
We were real hit and miss,

3742
02:53:21,340 --> 02:53:22,420
you know,
and you know,

3743
02:53:22,450 --> 02:53:23,283
if you went down,
you went down hard and you would go to 

3744
02:53:24,421 --> 02:53:25,254
that sometimes you had bomb,
like multiple sets in a row and just 

3745
02:53:27,521 --> 02:53:30,400
wasn't,
it wasn't clicking click and then boom,

3746
02:53:30,760 --> 02:53:31,593
you,
you hit on it and figured out what a 

3747
02:53:33,101 --> 02:53:34,390
fucking,
what it was.

3748
02:53:34,930 --> 02:53:35,763
And it almost like you released 
something like you had like a demon 

3749
02:53:39,311 --> 02:53:39,780
inside it.

3750
02:53:39,780 --> 02:53:41,530
You pulled it out and you've released 
it.

3751
02:53:41,720 --> 02:53:43,090
And then all the sudden you were 
crushing.

3752
02:53:43,510 --> 02:53:44,940
I remember,
I think it was tripling.

3753
02:53:44,950 --> 02:53:47,350
And I were in the back by the,
uh,

3754
02:53:47,351 --> 02:53:48,184
the back hallway.
And it was like one of the Times where 

3755
02:53:49,721 --> 02:53:52,270
you just really started crushing.
And Tripoli was like,

3756
02:53:52,271 --> 02:53:54,700
Joey Diaz is on another level.
I go,

3757
02:53:54,701 --> 02:53:56,680
yeah man.
Like what the fuck?

3758
02:53:56,980 --> 02:53:57,813
Like you just caught it,
you caught a wave and all of a sudden 

3759
02:54:00,521 --> 02:54:03,760
you were surfing and then from then on 
you figured it out.

3760
02:54:03,761 --> 02:54:04,594
It was crazy.
Like you went from being like a really 

3761
02:54:07,391 --> 02:54:11,140
funny guy offstage and an occasionally 
funny guy on stage,

3762
02:54:11,141 --> 02:54:16,060
but often mediocre to a monster.
Just monster.

3763
02:54:16,061 --> 02:54:16,894
Like there was nights and the or will 
you destroy and we were falling out of 

3764
02:54:19,931 --> 02:54:23,500
the back stick.
We would leave like laughing so hard.

3765
02:54:23,501 --> 02:54:24,334
We would go down the backstairs out into
the hallway and it'd be like two or 

3766
02:54:26,861 --> 02:54:28,660
three guys slapping their legs.

3767
02:54:28,690 --> 02:54:29,810
Laugh.
I'd be dying.

3768
02:54:30,100 --> 02:54:30,933
I love that original room.
Listening to original room brings 

3769
02:54:33,701 --> 02:54:35,350
something out of you.
We're out of time.

3770
02:54:35,360 --> 02:54:37,570
There's only one time where I was.
I love you man.

3771
02:54:39,140 --> 02:54:42,210
Anytime at our fourth of July barbecue 
too.

3772
02:54:42,220 --> 02:54:43,810
Right to see you,
Jamie.

3773
02:54:43,811 --> 02:54:45,220
Yuck.
Yuck.

3774
02:54:45,400 --> 02:54:46,870
I'm going to go home.
They'll take us swimming.

3775
02:54:46,910 --> 02:54:49,320
That's always a photophobia.
His daughter just says Yuck.

3776
02:54:49,330 --> 02:54:50,550
And everything.
First time she met me,

3777
02:54:50,920 --> 02:54:54,800
she kissed me.
Kiss to everyday.

3778
02:54:54,850 --> 02:54:56,000
Do you want to have some of this?
Yuck,

3779
02:54:57,070 --> 02:54:58,390
but I showed her some ice cream and 
you're like,

3780
02:54:58,420 --> 02:54:59,830
oh,
that was our best friend.

3781
02:55:01,130 --> 02:55:03,810
Now the ice cream man.
A Joey Diaz.

3782
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:04,970
What is it?
The periscope.

3783
02:55:04,971 --> 02:55:06,620
How do people get to it?
I don't know.

3784
02:55:07,100 --> 02:55:08,870
Oh,
I'll just follow them on twitter.

3785
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:12,890
Is it up on twitter?
What time in the morning?

3786
02:55:13,010 --> 02:55:16,100
Five after five after eight.
You got to check that out.

3787
02:55:16,130 --> 02:55:17,450
Get you get your day.
Started off with that.

3788
02:55:17,660 --> 02:55:20,480
Of course.
A mad flavor on twitter,

3789
