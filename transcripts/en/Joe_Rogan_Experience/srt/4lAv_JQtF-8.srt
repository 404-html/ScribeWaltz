1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
Let's do the countdown is false 
calendar.

2
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:03,390
You go four,
three,

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,620
two,
one.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,970
And we're live.
What's up my brother quick.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,680
I know how it goes.
I like it.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,560
Very efficient.
I could just start,

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,790
just start.
Boom.

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,620
Make it happen.
Like it.

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,810
So things are getting weird real quick 
when you're thinking about this,

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,340
this uh,
orange fella.

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,080
I mean I got to say for me it's the best
time ever to start a news service and we

12
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:35,940
started a daily show about a month 
before and it just is like,

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,340
wow.
And you do want it on vice,

14
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:39,880
on your channel?
No,

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,290
it's with HBO.
It's a daily news show on HBO.

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,240
It's like we were doing so well on 
weekly.

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,120
I don't know about shit.
Why didn't I know about this?

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,130
We did our weekly show,
right?

19
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:49,964
And that was doing well.
So they gave us a daily show and they 

20
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,910
were going to just put it on HBO now and
go.

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,620
But then it was doing.
So they put us on,

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,670
on the air,
on TV.

23
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,060
So it's every night.
This is the best possible compliment for

24
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,010
your show.
Your show is like,

25
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,383
what?
I would expect someone who's never done 

26
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:05,574
a show before to do,
if you just gave them a fuck load of 

27
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:09,330
money,
that's probably.

28
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:10,164
That's exactly hosts who have really 
never hosted anything before and gave 

29
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:17,440
them a fuck load of money that the whole
thing feels so [inaudible].

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,380
The wrong word to use is unprofessional 
but polished.

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,390
Unpolished,
unfakeable.

32
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,520
There you go.
That's unpolished is no one talking like

33
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,230
this.
There's no Brian Williams.

34
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,960
We didn't know what we were doing and 
when we started.

35
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,853
Perfect.
The,

36
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,763
the criticisms came.
My favorite was from the New York Times 

37
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,260
was it's just a bunch of hipsters and 
skinny jeans and tattoos,

38
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:43,950
high fiving in war zones.
And I was like,

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,993
if,
if you aren't criticizing the news are 

40
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,010
criticizing the truth or the facts of 
the stories.

41
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:50,843
You're just criticizing that.
We have tattoos and we don't look like 

42
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:53,930
you.
We want.

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,870
Yeah,
fuck you.

44
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,750
Perfect.
So that was our first season and yeah,

45
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,460
ever since I wouldn't they celebrate 
that.

46
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,533
That's really interesting.
It's really interesting to see a bunch 

47
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,370
of young Weirdos in war zones.
You know,

48
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:09,630
there was one that you guys did.
I don't remember the location it was,

49
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,464
but one of the reporters was out there 
and he had a flak jacket on and he was 

50
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:15,324
surrounded by all these rebels in there,
in these bombed out buildings and you 

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,593
hear,
you hear things going off in the 

52
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,370
distance and he's like kind of calmly 
explaining,

53
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:25,450
okay,
so what's going on is they're there,

54
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:26,284
they're bombing the location very close 
to us and they over there and he's like 

55
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,070
pointing at.
I'm like,

56
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,880
hopefully better understand that guys,
I think it was Ben Anderson,

57
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,330
I just,
we just did a thing on the resurgence of

58
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:41,040
the Taliban in Afghanistan and how it's 
basically going back to the same borders

59
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,874
that it was pre-invasion and that he's 
under fire the whole time and he's just 

60
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:47,450
like,
you know,

61
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,010
and he just goes down on one knee and he
keeps talking,

62
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,933
unfazed.

63
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,893
And as they're driving back there,
they're clearing out these cds and 

64
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:56,950
they're just pulling it with a rope and,
and,

65
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,853
and like pulling out.
The IED is with a rope and he's just 

66
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:01,840
standing there calmly knowing they don't
blow up.

67
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,723
No,
he's calmly like talking to the camera 

68
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,150
as all this shit is happening and you're
like,

69
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,750
this guy's fucking special dude on 
antidepressants.

70
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,513
He,
I asked him about it one time and he 

71
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:13,781
goes,
you know,

72
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:14,614
I have this thing where there's like a 
32nd lag between like some guy that you 

73
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,690
want to die and he's got a 32nd lag 
between when he realizes that and so he,

74
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,250
he,
he,

75
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,570
he comes across as just to have like,
you know,

76
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,750
an unflappable.
But wow,

77
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,053
it's a genetic thing.
He's also fucking the best word during 

78
00:03:31,851 --> 00:03:32,684
list out there.
So it didn't fall on his head as a 

79
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,444
youth.

80
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,260
Is there something missing?
Is there a broken part and he's just,

81
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,760
he's built for the job,
for the job.

82
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,743
Well,
I'd like to see that in this day and 

83
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,133
age.
I mean we're dealing with this weird 

84
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:48,220
time where the president of United 
States points to CNN and says,

85
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:50,080
I'm not talking to you,
your fake news.

86
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,120
And then the meme comes,
you know what?

87
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:56,930
The sunglasses fall down,
but the thug life with him and you,

88
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,150
you do get a lot of fake news though.
Yeah,

89
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,013
getting a lot of these unsubstantiated 
reports about him with prostitutes in 

90
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:05,440
urine and they're talking about it on 
the fucking news,

91
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:08,710
which is unprecedented.
There's fake news on both sides.

92
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,190
That's the problem and there's so much 
of it that it's,

93
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,050
it's,
it's,

94
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,490
it's almost impossible to wade through 
it all.

95
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,770
Yeah.
And you know,

96
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,640
for us when after the election everybody
came to me and said,

97
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:22,120
what should we do?

98
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,260
And I said we got to just be logical 
fact based,

99
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,260
middle of the road press record,
nonpolitical,

100
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:30,640
nonpartisan.
None of this shit.

101
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:33,250
We just go out there and do it.
The problem is,

102
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,800
you know,
we view ourself as centrists and sort of

103
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:36,634
press record all that stuff,
but if the world takes a sort of giant 

104
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,760
leap to the right with,
you know,

105
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,770
fake news and all this crazy shit 
happening,

106
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,933
then you're sitting there sort of going,
well all of a sudden we were putting 

107
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:49,540
this position.
Like for me,

108
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,040
I always,
I always bring it up and say like,

109
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,130
I'm an environmentalist because there's 
a boogeyman.

110
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,700
They're like,
we all get fucked.

111
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:57,190
If the environment gets fucked.
And there's,

112
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,690
there's a boogeyman that we can that we 
can sort of go against and it's good for

113
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:02,441
everybody,
you know,

114
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:04,560
whatever.
And the problem is,

115
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:05,394
is,
I dunno when environmentalism became a 

116
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,350
left thing.

117
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,100
It should be for anyone who's saying 
anyone who's smart and you know,

118
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,360
I spend time like going back to war,
like when you spend a lot of time in war

119
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:19,180
zones,
the one thing when you talk to people in

120
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:22,150
those war zones is wharf is fucked.
It's not fun.

121
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:22,984
It's not heroic.
It's not like a manly shot in the 

122
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,780
catheter bags and you're fucked up and 
you have your head's missing.

123
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,030
Your ass is missing,
your balls are.

124
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,593
And so it's,
when you go to these things you never 

125
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:38,170
want to go back kind of thing.
You know,

126
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,740
when you talk about the environment,
when you talk to the scientists,

127
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,910
they're all like,
well,

128
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,040
of course it's a global scientific 
consensus.

129
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:45,874
Of course it is.
And then I did this piece this year on 

130
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:50,950
in season five.
It's going to be the first piece.

131
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:51,784
And I'm like,
I literally don't understand what the 

132
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:54,790
fuck is happening here.

133
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,620
Because if you talk to every scientist 
now,

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,740
they're terrible at getting information 
scientists,

135
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,291
but they're like,
well,

136
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,150
that's not my fucking job.
My job is to do science.

137
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,290
I don't fucking know.
So,

138
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,770
but you know,
there's this global scientific consensus

139
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:07,850
of,
you know,

140
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,930
global warming,
97 percent,

141
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:10,520
which never happens in any science,
right?

142
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:12,500
Ever.
But there's all this,

143
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,650
I'm a doubt not all over the world,
but it a lot in America still.

144
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,670
So we looked at it,
we said,

145
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,440
why,
what the fuck is happening here?

146
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,520
And there's now three age,
three attorney,

147
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,773
attorneys general with 20 other in 
support have come out for this lawsuit 

148
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:36,311
now against Exxon Ceo of Exxon is now 
our secretary of state rex tillerson.

149
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:38,054
And so the,
what happened was they knew in the 

150
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,540
seventies and eighties that fossil fuel,
um,

151
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,990
uh,
you know,

152
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,120
burning fossil fuels,
carbon in the air,

153
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,110
carbon emission caused global warming 
and was a factor for global warming.

154
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,410
And then they realized this is going to 
be bad for business.

155
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:01,380
So in the eighties and nineties and now 
they spend billions of dollars on,

156
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,543
on,
you know,

157
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,640
discrediting the science.
That's the whole thing.

158
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:05,720
Well,
there's no consensus,

159
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:07,480
there's no consensus.
Uh,

160
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,930
that's the,
that's the thing.

161
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,700
And they spend billions of dollars to do
it.

162
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,300
There is a consensus.
Does he told him I did.

163
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,410
Amazing.
Amazing.

164
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,270
And so highlights that.
Yeah,

165
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,350
exactly.
And a lot of people,

166
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,184
it's the same people.
What that highlights is it's the exact 

167
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:25,130
same scientist and the exact same people
and groups and uh,

168
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,450
more like smoking spokespeople and went 
after cigarettes,

169
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,680
cigarettes,
it.

170
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:32,580
Well,
in some cases the same scientist,

171
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,101
they said,
oh,

172
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:36,710
well it's exact same thing.
It's questioned the science.

173
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,580
It's,
you know,

174
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,040
well there's not,
we can't really figure out smoking.

175
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,903
Lung cancer could be anything and do it 
loudly and concisely with quick 

176
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:44,834
sentences where they're very well 
prepared and they did the exact same 

177
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,740
thing with global warming.

178
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,230
And that's why when you come here and 
you talk to people and say,

179
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,370
you know,
look,

180
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,910
we have to do this,
we have to know science isn't settled.

181
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:56,780
Fuck you.
And you're like,

182
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,643
it's like back in the day when your 
mouth would open and a cigarette would 

183
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:01,970
come out and say,
smoking is good for you.

184
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,460
Or whatever.
It's like an oil can comes out.

185
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:04,911
You're like,
no,

186
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:05,744
the science isn't settled yet.
This whole argument that the science 

187
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:10,280
isn't settled yet.
Like you said,

188
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,850
it's being perpetrated by the people 
that can profit on the science not being

189
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:14,684
settled here and that gets really scary 
because people being fucking do and it 

190
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:19,654
gets scary is it makes it real 
convenient for right wing people who 

191
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:22,784
just classically think and vote and 
behave right wing to just adopt that 

192
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:29,650
thinking and then and thing and you're 
like,

193
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,130
it's not a fucking left thing like 
you're a hundred like to go ahead.

194
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,430
It's an everybody who likes to go 
outside thing.

195
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,860
It's like everybody likes to hunt thing.
Everyone likes to swim.

196
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:38,990
Thing is everyone like that served a 
drink.

197
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,850
Fucking water,
right?

198
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,021
I mean,
did you see this?

199
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:42,854
There was a new report that came out 
today about the infrastructure in terms 

200
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:46,694
of the water supply,
the pipes that we have that the water's 

201
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,400
being carried with rotting out your 
place in this country.

202
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,590
It will cost a trillion dollars,
but they're saying that flint,

203
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,010
but what

204
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,180
happened in flint could happen in a lot 
of the pope.

205
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,950
It's just old infrastructure.
It needs to be replaced,

206
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,960
you know,
and here it is national.

207
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,823
Flint's America's one point 2 million 
miles of deteriorating lead pipes and 

208
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:10,620
they'll cost $1,000,000,000,000
to fix it.

209
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,890
One thing that I like about trump is 
that he has been saying that he wants to

210
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:14,724
address the infrastructure and he wants 
to put people to work fixing all the 

211
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,410
problems that exist and creating jobs by
fixing all these types of.

212
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,610
Which is another famous presidents at 
the same thing.

213
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,593
Which one?
FDR.

214
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,090
Oh yeah,
yeah.

215
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,310
Oh,
he's a good guy,

216
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,290
right?
Very good one.

217
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,290
It's hard to say who's a good one.
We only liked the ones that get shot.

218
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,560
I had like a whole bit about that,
but we like Kennedy and like Lincoln.

219
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,720
Well,
it's interesting

220
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,370
because the president,
if you really look at it traditionally,

221
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,533
you know,
there,

222
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,433
there are big power is right now is when
you do appointees or when you get a 

223
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:49,270
judge through or when you do an 
appointee,

224
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,000
you know,
you,

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,833
you put your cabinet together,
then the cabinet as power and the 

226
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,523
president goes on to opening bridges and
flying around the world and shaking 

227
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:01,340
hands and kissing babies.
And I think that that's what,

228
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,720
you know,
what we said is we're not going to,

229
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,540
as a news agency,
look at the bloombastic or the,

230
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,660
uh,
the titillating headlines or they,

231
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,700
oh my God,
he said that we're going to look after a

232
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:14,534
policy.
We're going to look at what is the EPA 

233
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,803
with a guy who runs the EPA,
who tried to sue the EPA and shut it 

234
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:21,950
down.
What is the energy?

235
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,770
What is the Department of Energy look 
like with Rick Perry?

236
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,200
Who as when he ran for president,
said I would,

237
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,510
I would shut down the Department of 
Energy.

238
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,500
What does that look with him actually 
running it or sessions?

239
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,040
Who Actually,
uh,

240
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,893
is now the attorney general who sued the
government many times against climate 

241
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:42,540
change reform or rex Tillerson,
you know,

242
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,813
who ran the largest fossil fuel 
companies will now being secretary of 

243
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:46,724
state.
So we're looking more at just policy 

244
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,070
what policy changes because of this 
cabinet,

245
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,913
etc.
Etc.

246
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,620
YEah,
it's really weird.

247
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,100
It's like

248
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,100
everybody thought this was going to be 
this sort of,

249
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,220
uh,
get rid of political correctness,

250
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:06,221
stop all these whiny crybaby liberals.
And then once he got into office,

251
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,830
a lot of the same people that I talked 
to that were kind of in supportive.

252
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:12,440
I'm just kind of stepped back and went 
whoa.

253
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,480
Like alreadY,
like right away,

254
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,150
keystone pipeline,
the dakota access,

255
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,190
abortion,
abortion.

256
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,330
I mean they're,
they're cutting,

257
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,650
they're cutting insurance,
pay a payment,

258
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,850
paying of abor.
How would you say that?

259
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,470
The funding of abortion.
It's like you can't get an abortion with

260
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:31,304
insurance anymore.
Yeah.

261
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,520
is that what they have?
They passed that has that been passed?

262
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,800
Which is uh,
you know,

263
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,070
obviously for some people that don't 
like abortions,

264
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:41,090
it's a very touchy subject,
which ironically,

265
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,120
the same people who love war.
It's very strange.

266
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,060
I don't want you killing babies.
They don't mind killing people.

267
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:48,830
Once they're full,
they can go fuck themselves,

268
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,803
especially if they live in some other 
spot and he's really fucking building 

269
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,033
wall.

270
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,410
It wasn't just rhetoric.
Yeah,

271
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,100
I mean it's,
it's,

272
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,720
he's a guy who got elected on a 
populist,

273
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,310
uh,
platforms.

274
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,840
So he's going to do some of those 
things.

275
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,570
It's going to be interesting.
I mean,

276
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,860
I think two things about it.
I don't really think so much about trump

277
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,930
as much as two things.
I think a,

278
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,960
it shows a sort of generational divide,
you know,

279
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,410
it's not just trump [inaudible] you 
looked,

280
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,870
you saw in brexit,
you're seeing it in France,

281
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:24,640
you saw natalie,
you're seeing it,

282
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,910
you know,
in many countries around the world where

283
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,500
you have the largest cohort,
the largest demographic is gen y,

284
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,783
but the socioeconomic and political 
power is mostly still controlled by the 

285
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:38,404
boomers.
So you have this sort of generational 

286
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,950
divide.
And what happened in America was,

287
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:45,760
you know,
the,

288
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,840
the gen y was more an fractured,
you know,

289
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:50,674
we talked a little bit,
but there's a fractured because of 

290
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:54,910
bernie sanders and hillary and people 
just didn't like hillary.

291
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,890
And so,
and by the way she's,

292
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,320
you know,
an older generation as well.

293
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,393
And then trump was the sort of baby 
boomers like living in the gated 

294
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:04,470
community saying we don't want all that 
bad shit to happen.

295
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,313
I understand why people don't want to 
believe environmental change because 

296
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:08,380
it's scary and it's bad.
And it's like,

297
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:09,300
fuck,
I don't want to believe in that,

298
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:11,740
so I'm not going to believe in that.
And so I think,

299
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,603
but you have this generational divide 
and now what you have is just sort of 

300
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:18,670
this backlash of kids going like in 
brexit,

301
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:19,540
they're like,
what the fuck?

302
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,390
You guys vote to fucking leave europe 
and now fucked,

303
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,860
you know,
hold on a second.

304
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:25,240
And now I think you're going to get 
that.

305
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,074
So I think it's,
it's sort of a global thing and I think 

306
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:30,140
it's also young people are,
are,

307
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,630
are getting upset and also they're 
learning.

308
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,000
You should have fucking voted.
Yeah,

309
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,511
I,
I've,

310
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:37,000
I've talked to quite a few people that 
were pissed off that didn't vote.

311
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,930
Yeah.
Like,

312
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,750
well that's kind of weird.
And they were like,

313
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,650
well,
California is going to hillary anyway.

314
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,730
Uh,
okay.

315
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,380
Sorta.
Yeah.

316
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,530
Well that's the problem.
Like,

317
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,364
you know,
California legalized recreational 

318
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:53,890
marijuana and a sessions.
Yeah.

319
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,350
He doesn't know.
He doesn't want it.

320
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,890
He literally is on record saying they 
good people don't smoke marijuana.

321
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,370
What about drink scotch?
People drink scotch.

322
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:05,320
What about cigars?
And good people smoke cigars,

323
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:07,420
jeff.
And as I work and I think that that's,

324
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,630
you know,
if you look at it every,

325
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,180
I think young people know what side of 
history they want to be on.

326
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:13,960
like we're all,
like,

327
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,900
we all know it's going to be legalized.
We all know what's going to be there.

328
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:19,180
It's going to be like say three years,
maybe five years,

329
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,313
and then all this shit,
all those people in jail don't have to 

330
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:22,030
be in jail.

331
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,863
All this money,
all this tax money could go and look at 

332
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,290
what happened in Colorado.
All the cartels and all the,

333
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,020
all this stuff.
It's just like it's going to happen.

334
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:30,730
So anybody who comes along and says,
nope,

335
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,720
fuck that.
You're like,

336
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,370
well,
you're on the wrong side of history,

337
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:33,911
brother.
Well,

338
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:34,744
he's lifted up.
What trump has said is that he's going 

339
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:39,610
to leave it up to the states,
so if he leaves it up to the states,

340
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:40,444
it's just going to go across the country
and then what are they going to do 

341
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:43,900
federally and once it becomes state 
legal everywhere,

342
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,120
and then the federal government still 
says it's illegal.

343
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,140
What did they do then?
I mean,

344
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:47,974
did they change then because they have 
to change a lot because of the money 

345
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,040
they have to change law because in

346
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,820
Colorado it's legal but you can't bank 
it,

347
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,410
you know,
it's a fucking mess.

348
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,720
SubmAssive armored cars and guys with 
guns.

349
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:00,554
I know a lot of guys who are former 
seals and and you know guys who worked 

350
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:08,270
for blackwater and now they're fucking 
holding guns at at we chops because they

351
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:09,710
got a million dollars in cash in the 
bank,

352
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:12,270
which is bad enough with one state,
but when it's 20 states,

353
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,820
fucking places in that state,
think about one state.

354
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:17,654
How many marks do you have weren't 
running around and it all has to be 

355
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:22,274
cashed,
but to grow your own shit in Colorado 

356
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:24,560
too.
That's the other thing.

357
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:25,394
You're not buying it from somebody.
You have to grow it if you're selling 

358
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:27,704
it.
So they're creating a dangerous 

359
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,300
situation and people have already been 
robbed.

360
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:33,650
Correct.
And you know,

361
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,543
the whole thing.
To me it was really disappointing when 

362
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:41,750
the dea didn't change the classification
from schedule one in august,

363
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:43,280
like they,
they had the opportunity.

364
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,650
All the evidence was there.
They know the evidence is there and they

365
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:49,790
fucking lied about it.
And this is under obama also.

366
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,130
The problem with that is because it's 
scheduled,

367
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,550
you can't do research on cancer,
you know,

368
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:58,600
all of those cbd stuff that you know 
that's coming out now.

369
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,443
It's not psychoactive,
which is so important for people who 

370
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:02,924
have issues like arthritis,
and I had joe valtellIna here was a 

371
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,440
former kickboxing champion.
He's a commentator now for glory.

372
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,423
He told me that he was locked in a room 
after one of his concussions from his 

373
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:13,694
last fight,
locked in a room in the dark for three 

374
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,184
weeks because you couldn't even see the 
light on the power button on a cell 

375
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:24,190
phone to charge a cell phone like the 
little red light where it shows you that

376
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,093
that would give him a headache.
And so cbd oil cured and it's not 

377
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,720
illegal.

378
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,553
And that's the thing is again,
what side of history do beyond like we 

379
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,630
know all of this stuff.
We know where it's going,

380
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,780
why the fuck are we slowing down now?
Well,

381
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:41,930
it's a bunch of old people.
That's really what it is.

382
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,690
It's a bunch of old people who don't get
high and you know,

383
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:47,990
and they're scared of it and instead of 
looking at it pragmatically,

384
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,913
objectively looking at the science,
they're looking at it like some goddamn 

385
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,880
19 fifties episode of dragnet.
You know,

386
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,340
joe frIday's coming in for losers.
It's frustrated.

387
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,500
Are you a loser mickey?
That's,

388
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,910
that's really what's going on.
It's,

389
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,230
it's very strange.
Yeah.

390
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,340
We did this story,
uh,

391
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,670
you know,
the kings of cannabis,

392
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:08,504
you know,
these guys,

393
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,493
they're like the seed hunters.
They fly around the world and they find 

394
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:13,094
like the best seed strains and then they
go back to holland and they make like 

395
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,920
they wanted the cannabis cup like six,
eight years in a row that,

396
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:20,900
you know,
they did white widow,

397
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,760
the cannabis cup real quick.

398
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,773
I was one of the fucking judges.
We've know these guys are two dutch 

399
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:29,000
guys.
These guys not only did it once,

400
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:30,350
I'm going to do it again.
It's a farce.

401
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,460
Okay?
This is what they give you.

402
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,503
They give you,
you know how those old ladies to take 

403
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:34,800
pills,
like if you're a,

404
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,570
like someone else to take your arthritis
medication and you have like seven days,

405
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,321
monday,
tuesday,

406
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:39,861
wednesday,
thursday,

407
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,720
those little things.
They give you one of those.

408
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,530
Each one of those things has weed and 
you just start fucking smoking.

409
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,930
You're going to watch one,
three races.

410
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,690
You have no idea.
The first of hits you're on and you just

411
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:52,524
fucking hammer in it and then 
everybody's talking in this ridiculous 

412
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,850
jargon.
They're like,

413
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,260
oh,
this is really tasty.

414
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,140
They're a fucking super annoying and 
stinky.

415
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,233
And talking about the cannabis community
had this weird conversation with this 

416
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:06,060
one dude who won.

417
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,480
When the fuck knows,
I don't even know who I voted for.

418
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,690
I have no idea.
I was so high afterwards.

419
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,524
I was having out of body experiences 
because people were giving me cookies 

420
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,030
and candies.
It was one of,

421
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,013
if not the highest,
one of the highest I've ever been in my 

422
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:21,594
life.
Maybe the highest because we were at 

423
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:24,870
this place on melrose.
It was a,

424
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:25,704
um,
a head shop and in the back they had 

425
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:27,714
this pop thing and um,
it was just filled with fucking people 

426
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:32,010
in this.
No ventilation,

427
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:36,700
just filled with pot smoker.
and this is an amsterdam los angeles.

428
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,243
They did it in La and they're passing 
around bongs and pipes and cookies and 

429
00:18:41,731 --> 00:18:45,000
cakes and they had security there to 
make sure no one would come and they had

430
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:48,150
it all blocked off and they did a smart 
job like the way they handled it,

431
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:51,650
but as far as like actually judging 
what's the best pot,

432
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,500
the fuck outta here.
No one has any idea.

433
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,483
It's like giving you seven glasses of 
whiskey and then telling you to drink 

434
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:01,380
some wine.
What wine do you like,

435
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,214
shane?

436
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,160
That's generally how it is.
Yeah,

437
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,100
exactly.
That's how most of our podcasts are now.

438
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,840
Men.
I judged it and it was.

439
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:12,660
I don't remember what I judged.
I don't remember what the pot was like.

440
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,553
I was.
I was a poor judge and everybody else 

441
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,620
has a poor judge too,
but I'm being honest about it.

442
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,050
There you go.
If you wanted a judge,

443
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,700
can't.
You wanted to have a real cannabis cup.

444
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,833
You would give someone a strain for a 
week and then give them another strain 

445
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,693
for a week and have make them keep a 
journal and then make them send in that 

446
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:30,414
journal like,
this is my experience on this is how 

447
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,730
much I smoke,
this is what it felt like.

448
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,530
Body high,
head,

449
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,070
strong.
Some of that shit.

450
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:41,400
It's like,
it's my stuff.

451
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,040
It's getting to a strange place now for 
sure.

452
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,520
Because what's interesting to me is when
people who don't smoke it,

453
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,560
smoke it,
then I get to see because we're,

454
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,630
our tolerance is so high because we 
smoke it.

455
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,080
I smoke it almost every Day.
At least five days a week.

456
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:55,914
I probably smoke weed.
So when I see people that tried for the 

457
00:19:58,831 --> 00:19:59,664
first time and you see that terrified 
look in their eye when they're 

458
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,890
confronted with their own mortality and 
they feel the earth spinning and they're

459
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:05,730
like,
jesus,

460
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,890
I've got a question for you.
Mr.

461
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,010
Smoker?
Okay.

462
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,780
Because my problem is I'm an ex smoker,
not smoker.

463
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,370
I'm uh,
currently I'm an ex smoker,

464
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:15,204
smoker.
And so smoking always makes me want to 

465
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,860
smoke cigarettes a,
b.

466
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,270
So I do like a,
you know,

467
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,670
they have all the different things now,
the one,

468
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:28,380
the one I like is uh,
is this high cbd sort of,

469
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,850
uh,
but it's,

470
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,650
it gets you.
Hi honey.

471
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,680
Oh yeah.
And it's fucking awesome.

472
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,510
Whatever you need I can get.
but the thing is,

473
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,750
I've got a question because I was 
thinking about this yesterday because I,

474
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:42,470
I'm,
I'm,

475
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,400
I'm like reading all about,
you know,

476
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,410
how it stops cancer.

477
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,310
ThIs is great for this and great for 
that and stuff.

478
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:48,160
So I'm like,
fuck yeah,

479
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,280
but isn't smoking it's still bad for 
you?

480
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,750
No,
apparently not.

481
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,500
In that it's actually scientists.
Zack,

482
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,880
it actually acts as an expectorant on 
your lungs.

483
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,130
It's actually good for people that have 
emphysema.

484
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,130
It's actually good for people that have 
issues with their lungs,

485
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,990
which is really strange.
Asthma,

486
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,660
really good for asthma.
Smoking weed.

487
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,710
Yeah.
Crazy.

488
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,090
It doesn't seem to make sense.
No,

489
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,990
it more much better though because 
smoking is still kind of harsh,

490
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,690
but the effect of the cannabis smoke,
cannabis smoke is not toxic the same way

491
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:19,524
as cigarette smoke is.
And one of the reasons why cigarette 

492
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,324
smoke is toxic is not just the tobacco,
which is 599 fucking chemicals or 

493
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,420
whatever the hell it is.
Now,

494
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,600
marijuana users have good lungs for 
transplanting.

495
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,120
So if you get high walk off a building,
whoops man.

496
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:37,871
Yeah,
you're.

497
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:40,660
Your lungs are good,
but you don't have to smoke it.

498
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:41,494
Here's,
here's what I'm down with these fucking 

499
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:44,800
things that I got charged and right 
here,

500
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,520
these vape pens,
some of them suck because some of them,

501
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:51,520
the ones that look like like an 
e-cigarette,

502
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,770
those suck.
They don't have enough juice.

503
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,813
They're not powerful enough.
You want one that has a really good 

504
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,133
pull.

505
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,183
There you go.
That's good because these are you high 

506
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,300
like getting high,
getting high.

507
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,433
Whereas the other ones,
he got to keep hitting them over and 

508
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:14,990
over and over and over again to get 
high.

509
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,970
These mother fuckers get hot because 
that batteries,

510
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,280
fat cells,
fat,

511
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:20,114
that battery is as much fat are the 
other ones when you get the ones that 

512
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:24,530
are skinny like this.
The other problem with the ones that are

513
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:25,410
skinny,
ms.you

514
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,460
get a lot of duds.
They make it.

515
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:29,120
A lot of them in China,
sorry China,

516
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,283
but a lot of them suck band,
like my friend gina who sells me 

517
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:36,350
everything,
he gave me three.

518
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,690
No four pens and three of them were 
duds.

519
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,593
Nearly three out of four were duds.
If it was all legal than exactly what 

520
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:46,650
your quality control to control.
Yeah.

521
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,923
They were packaged to see the whole deal
is that are packaged ready and when 

522
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:52,520
you're getting these ones that are 
prepackaged,

523
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,650
like you throw them away when they're 
done,

524
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,753
it's very wasteful.

525
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,830
So this you just get this little 
cartridge.

526
00:22:57,831 --> 00:22:58,664
You slide the cartridge into this big 
fat battery thing and there were no 

527
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,330
scared.
Was scared it a good boy.

528
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,470
It's a good time,
man.

529
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,530
It's a good time for that and it's a 
good time for people to do.

530
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,280
The problem is the research is still.
Federal research is still impossible.

531
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,593
Doing real,
real hardcore research on large scale 

532
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:21,254
research nationwide and we should be 
going anything that shows some promise 

533
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,873
re cancer.
We should be going whole hog after in 

534
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:30,470
the fact that we're not as just 
ridiculous.

535
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,333
I'm worried that he has such trump such 
incredible connections to money and 

536
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:36,710
that,
you know,

537
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,570
all the good parts that's going to come 
from that,

538
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,840
like his no nonsense approach to 
infrastructure,

539
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:42,674
wanting to rebuild a lot of things,
put a lot of people to work because of 

540
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:45,920
that and a lot of benefit from that.

541
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,383
WHat scares me is that money connection 
with the pharmaceutical companies who 

542
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:52,154
have just gone way,
way out of their way to try to stifle 

543
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,953
marijuana research at every possible 
turn and legalization at every possible 

544
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:05,270
turn and it's criminal.
What would they do is awful,

545
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:05,720
you know,
the.

546
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,660
Because when you make something illegal,
it's not just making something illegal,

547
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:09,494
which is why I had,
I had to like drill this into the head 

548
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:14,220
of a friend of mine who was pro hillary 
and uh,

549
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,070
you know,
he's asking me why I'm upset with her.

550
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:16,821
And I said,
look dude,

551
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:17,654
there's a fucking email that was leaked.
The wiki leaks email that said she's 

552
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:23,600
against marijuana in every sense of the 
word.

553
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,733
This was a,
she was making a promise to some 

554
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:28,910
organization,
I don't remember who it was,

555
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,670
but they were asking her,
what is our stance on marijuana?

556
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,650
She's againsT it in every sense of the 
word.

557
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:34,484
How could you be?
That's like saying I'm against peanut 

558
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:37,970
butter in every sense of the word.
You know,

559
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:40,730
like what are you a monster?
You want people to go to jail for peanut

560
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:41,790
butter.
You know,

561
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,080
like the problem is,
it's not just that you don't like it,

562
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:48,830
which I'm fine with.
The problem is you could make people get

563
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:52,040
locked in a cage.
That's a crime.

564
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,170
It's a crime.
We know this is an oculus.

565
00:24:54,171 --> 00:24:56,210
I of just hit it.
We're having a conversation.

566
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:59,150
There's no problems.
This is not some devil weed.

567
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:01,760
It's not going to ruin lives.
I pay taxes,

568
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,460
I have a family.
Everything's fine.

569
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:06,770
I wake up when the alarm goes off,
so we're when fed bullshit.

570
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,710
And when someone who In the position of 
running for president,

571
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:12,290
like hilary says something crazy like 
that,

572
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,260
she's against marijuana legalization in 
every sense of the word.

573
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,200
That means some people are going to go 
to jail.

574
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,093
That means people are going to get shot.
That means more mexican drug gangs are 

575
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:25,040
going to ship more illegal product over 
here.

576
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,070
The church is being done.
No research is being done.

577
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:30,680
People are going to die from cancer that
don't have to die.

578
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,980
People are going to get diseases.
They don't have it.

579
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,620
This is my problem because again,
it's what side of history do you want to

580
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:40,970
be on and I think that most people who 
grew up the way we did it or seen people

581
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:42,800
are just saying what the fuck?
Exactly.

582
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,540
Exactly.
Exactly,

583
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,263
and as you said,
there's five different positive aspects 

584
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:51,860
for it and by the way,
we all know where it's going.

585
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,000
If it doesn't go in that direction,
we're going to have a fucking revolution

586
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:00,500
and they need to understand that what 
you saw with that women's march when the

587
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,080
day after trump was inaugurated,
when you see millions of people,

588
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:05,950
there's a million people in la,
they expected 80,000,

589
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,510
970,000
fucking people showed up.

590
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,030
Whitney coming sent me some pictures 
when she was there.

591
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,130
I was like,
holy shit,

592
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,820
this is crazy.
That kind of movement,

593
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,863
it's not just connected to women's 
rights and it certainly is at that that 

594
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,730
day,
but it's a mindset.

595
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,593
It's a mindset of protesting and 
fighting what they think is wrong and 

596
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:28,274
it's going to spread across the board.
So we're in a weird fucking bipolar 

597
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:34,620
situation.
This country bipolar situation,

598
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,950
the country in a lot of ways.
You know,

599
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,910
there's a lot of you fucking liberal 
crybabies bunch of loops.

600
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,100
This is the whole thing is that you,

601
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,630
you know,
I did a special on,

602
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,360
on dysfunctions picture from whitney 
cummings,

603
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,550
instagram.
Geez,

604
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,230
that's a lot of people will actually.
It's good because,

605
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,123
you know,
I think americans had forgotten how to 

606
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:56,514
sort of protest americans had forgotten 
that this is part of democracy and all 

607
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:00,720
this stuff.
We've been sort of,

608
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,360
You know,
talk radioing our,

609
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:04,841
our,
uh,

610
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:05,820
our anger,
you know,

611
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,753
in quiet and you know,
and I think it's good to go out and 

612
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:10,980
protest if you believe in it.
A,

613
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,570
b,
If you,

614
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,190
if you sort of look at what's happening 
politically,

615
00:27:16,191 --> 00:27:18,510
you know,
I did a thing on a house divided.

616
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,344
And what's interesting is if you ever do
anything on Israel and the palestinian 

617
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:25,190
pro palestinian people go after you.
If you ever been on palestine,

618
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,350
the israeli people go after everybody.
Like you can never do anything right.

619
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,480
It's the same thing when you do sort of,
you know,

620
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,410
politics here.

621
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,040
And we were,
you know,

622
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,903
we,
we thought we were incredibly even 

623
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:35,874
handed.
We gave republicans the same amount of 

624
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:39,270
time as the democrats and the democrats 
were like,

625
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:41,220
well,
you made the republicans look too good.

626
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,030
And,
but the thing is,

627
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:44,610
is when you look at it,
you say,

628
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,953
you know,
it's,

629
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,430
it's so broken that they used to be just
like a pendulum swings,

630
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:51,264
pendulum swings.
But now what's going to happen is that 

631
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:54,834
trump gets in,
he's going to undo a lot of the last 

632
00:27:57,271 --> 00:28:00,060
eight years than the dams.
When it swings to them,

633
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,510
we'll undo what he undid.
So it's not doing nothing.

634
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,290
Now it's going backwards.
And so you're sitting there saying,

635
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,124
there's a lot of shit that we got to 
solve and we can't solve it if we just 

636
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:13,644
keep going backwards politically.
And I think that's why there's so much 

637
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:18,630
frustration is because you're sitting 
there going,

638
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,493
let's unwind what they did for the past 
eight years and then someone else can 

639
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:23,400
get in and unwind.
But we unwound.

640
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:28,350
We have a real problem as human beings 
in getting into that team mentality.

641
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,030
There is so many of us on the left that 
have so many.

642
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,640
We,
we,

643
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,710
we agree with so many things at the 
right stands for like.

644
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,570
And there's so many on the right that 
agree with so many on the left,

645
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,370
you know,
I mean I'm more left than I am,

646
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,230
right.
But I'm pretty fucking right.

647
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,750
I'm riding on a lot of shit.
Like gun control

648
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,740
and your,
your,

649
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,633
your essential trust,
which is hopefully what most people 

650
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:50,624
should be.
That they can see the logic in both 

651
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:52,844
sides.
Yeah.

652
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,670
The problem is when you get too far to 
the left or too far to the right,

653
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,520
it's crazy.
And what?

654
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,790
WhaT's worrisome?
And it just,

655
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,650
you know,
farther look in France,

656
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,040
France elect a socialist,
you know,

657
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,933
pm.
and then all of a sudden the front 

658
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:11,210
nationale who were a joke become the 
leaders in the next election.

659
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,010
Yeah.
From nationality or like,

660
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,150
you know,
super.

661
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:14,480
Right,
right,

662
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,260
right,
right.

663
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,670
And so you sit there and say,
okay,

664
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,504
well everyone's moving far apart.
It's best when we're all just fucking 

665
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:23,330
working together.
The economy's doing well,

666
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,860
we're all getting it done.
And so you know,

667
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,830
we're sitting in,
in the sort of logical middle.

668
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,800
That's the problem with going too far to
any side.

669
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,470
And that's like you can be on either 
side on,

670
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:37,730
on issues and all this stuff.
But if you go too far and you're to sort

671
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:40,310
of dogmatic on either side,
that's when it gets scary

672
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,340
and it gets scary.
Quick.

673
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,683
Get scary real quick.
As soon as one incident happens and it 

674
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:47,530
gets scary.
And France,

675
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,573
imagine scary in this country,
will you have more guns than you have 

676
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:52,130
human beings.
That's it.

677
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,073
You know?
And that's what people will latch with 

678
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,650
the gun problem.
It's not a gun problem,

679
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:59,620
it's a human being problem.
And if we address it as a gun problem,

680
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:00,454
you're gonna make that human being 
problem even worse because you're going 

681
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:03,334
to take people's guns and you got to 
make them more angry or any kind of 

682
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,323
legislation that fights against their 
rights that they think are there by the 

683
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,420
founding fathers,
you're going to have a giant problem.

684
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,090
And when people think that you could 
just pull it away from them,

685
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:17,800
we're just going to take away the guns.
Fuck it.

686
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,870
There's nothing they can do.
Jesus christ,

687
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,490
there is definitely something they can 
do.

688
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,910
And you've got to be really fucking 
careful starting that war.

689
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,783
It goes back to messaging and you're 
saying like a lot of people are saying 

690
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,400
no the sciences out because they've 
spent billions of dollars to do that.

691
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,640
The thing is,
is when you are playing such far right,

692
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:38,150
far left partisan politics,
then you have people saying,

693
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,600
oh,
uh,

694
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,330
obamacare,
he's a socialist.

695
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:42,910
He's trying to take over the government.
He's trying to do this.

696
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,350
He's trying to do that and sort of 
blowing it up.

697
00:30:45,351 --> 00:30:47,090
Why?
Because that creates the tea party,

698
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,200
Which you know,
comes in.

699
00:30:48,201 --> 00:30:50,750
And then they have power and then the 
tea party by the way,

700
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:52,400
as to go back to their constituents and 
say,

701
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,810
we're going to repeal it,
we're going to do this,

702
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,600
we're going to be deliver.
And it just becomes a.

703
00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:00,670
Everything goes to the atomic level.
And so that when you actually go into,

704
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,770
into,
you know,

705
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,970
into congress or into the executive or 
into the senate,

706
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,013
and you try to get anything done,
you can't because you've promised that 

707
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:11,384
you're not gonna do anything.
You're not going to have any sort of 

708
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,490
partisan.
A relation.

709
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:17,610
Bipartisan bipartisan

710
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,261
relations.
yeah.

711
00:31:18,261 --> 00:31:19,280
It's fucked up,
man.

712
00:31:19,281 --> 00:31:20,210
It's,
and it's stupid.

713
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,700
And it exists because we have two 
parties.

714
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,540
When you make to people we make.
One of them were red and you make one of

715
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,610
them were blue.
They start wanting to fight each other.

716
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,860
It's,
it's a stupid thing.

717
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,103
Great.
You're also,

718
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:32,963
it doesn't matter if you're in or out,
you're always empower because there's 

719
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,434
only two.
So you're always going to be this sort 

720
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:38,350
of opposition.

721
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,183
Yeah.
And that influenced the problem is like 

722
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,600
this is what people have to realize a 
lot of your opinions.

723
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,300
And my opinions too,
I'm not really my opinions,

724
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,463
their opinions that I've decided are 
good that I've heard from other people 

725
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,853
and a lot of our patterns of behaviors 
from accents to the way we approach 

726
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:57,520
culture,
the way we think about women,

727
00:31:57,521 --> 00:32:00,760
the way we think about religion.
A lot of that is learned.

728
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,013
Okay.
And we have these two deeply ingrained 

729
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:04,954
patterns in this country.
We have the democrats and we have the 

730
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,683
republicans and the republicans are 
these no nonsense get business done and 

731
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,320
the democrats are,
you know,

732
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,183
we always think of all these people are 
all cry babies and they're all wishy 

733
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:20,700
washy and they're bleeding hearts.
And,

734
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,970
and that this is like ingrained in sort 
of ingrained in our system,

735
00:32:24,971 --> 00:32:25,804
these two different patterns of behavior
if they're severely problematic because 

736
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:30,604
you could exhibit a lot of traits on 
each sides and still be a very good 

737
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:37,490
person or a lot of ideas on each side 
and still be a very good.

738
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,650
If you look at.
I remember one,

739
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:39,980
uh,
you

740
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,813
know,
looking at sort of the clinton 

741
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:44,660
administration,
he took the largest deficit in history,

742
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:46,910
made it the largest,
a surplus in history,

743
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,343
a strong government.
Basically the tenants of the republican 

744
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:52,664
party w gets in trading is large,
the surplus and the largest deficit in 

745
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,430
expands the government,
et cetera.

746
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,850
But nobody said boo,
like when you're like,

747
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:04,010
hold on a second,
we just switched these things.

748
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,580
No one wants to criticize their side.
It's like,

749
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,970
it's like sports teams.
If it's exactly.

750
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,120
You pick your sports team when you're 
six,

751
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,530
you pick your political party because 
your parents do generally.

752
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,520
Yeah.
And,

753
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,420
and,
and where you are.

754
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:20,750
And then that's it.
I don't give a shit out as a democrat to

755
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:23,450
your dad in a lot of places is like 
coming out gay.

756
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,710
Yeah,
I bet it's probably because they're just

757
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,910
fucking democrats because were ashamed.
You're a fucking democrat.

758
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,060
You're going to vote for bernie sanders.
He only wants to do this family.

759
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,810
Bernie sanders wants to give all your 
money to black lives matter.

760
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:37,963
We actually did a show up as part of our
news thing of we had people going back 

761
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,763
for thanksgiving and it was the parents 
who voted for trump versus the kids who 

762
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,280
voted for either hillary or didn't vote 
or whatever,

763
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,070
and they were just fighting and crying 
and freaking out and like,

764
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,710
you know,
all this stuff and why did,

765
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,573
why,
why did we get to this level of 

766
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,740
dysfunction?
I mean,

767
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,140
it's a,
it's a problem when you have two sides,

768
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:00,930
you know,
it would.

769
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,763
It's very difficult for to sports teams 
to meet and say if they meet in neutral 

770
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:07,940
territory like vegas and the fans get 
along,

771
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,100
they're not going to get along.
People are fools.

772
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:11,660
we have tribal instincts.

773
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,823
We have instincts built into the.
When we were small bands of 50 people 

774
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:18,290
that could barely stay alive and we were
often wiped out often.

775
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,660
So your genealogy,
your family line,

776
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:22,850
all your history of when you love could 
be easily dead.

777
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:26,210
And so that was my questIon because it 
seems to me what I'm getting the feeling

778
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:28,880
now,
like humanity when they have a big thing

779
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:29,923
like a war or something,
it's just like we're all getting 

780
00:34:31,641 --> 00:34:32,474
together and we're all going to fucking 
do this together and we're going to 

781
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,950
science and we're going to work hard and
we're going to do all this.

782
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:41,180
And we're like fuck.
And then when you know,

783
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:42,014
this has been the largest or longest 
period of peace and prosperity the 

784
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:47,040
world's ever known.
yeah.

785
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,570
Right now we see things in Syria though.
I'm talking about sort of these are sort

786
00:34:50,571 --> 00:34:54,020
of isolated conflict,
but overall globally.

787
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,723
And what do we do?
We're sort of eatIng ourselves know 

788
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:00,470
we're looking inwards and just sent out,
fuck,

789
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:01,280
I hate that guy.
Right?

790
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,650
That with,
in their parties,

791
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:05,050
they eat themselves.
That,

792
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,440
that you,
you pick teams inside your team.

793
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,333
Sure.
Did baner black lives matter is now mad 

794
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:14,960
at the women.
The women that put on that women's march

795
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:20,020
and the transgender community is mad at 
the women who are the pussy hats.

796
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,063
Well guess they're saying that being a 
woman does not just mean you have a 

797
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,104
pussy,
you have a tea party came in and ousted 

798
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,753
canter and baner because they had the 
audacity to even go meet with the 

799
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:34,720
president or the democrats.
I mean people are just like,

800
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,120
well that's your fucking job is to go 
there and talk

801
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,630
and make shit happen.
Fuck naomi.

802
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,940
Anyway,
we can go on forever.

803
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,880
But I think,
you know,

804
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,200
both you and I are sort of coming to the
same point that you can put any name you

805
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:50,470
want on it,
what you're,

806
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,370
what you're coming to as a sort of 
dysfunctional relationship.

807
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,340
That's not going to end anytime soon.
but I'm hoping,

808
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,550
and this is totally possible that 
generation y,

809
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:00,384
like you're talking about generation x,
all these people that are growing up 

810
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:05,280
right now and just sort of waking up as 
adults,

811
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,190
like realizing like half those people 
that are wandering through the streets.

812
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:11,130
When you looked aT the women's march 
have those people are,

813
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:12,300
you know,
in their twenties.

814
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,210
They're young folks that are just kind 
of realizing like,

815
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:16,230
hey,
I'm a fucking adult.

816
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:18,360
I can go out and organize,
I can get something done,

817
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:19,194
I can do.
I am really hoping that this message 

818
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:23,730
will get out,
that it is high time.

819
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,593
We abandoned this fucking goofy system 
and that we demand a better system for 

820
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:29,844
running 350 million people and one 
figurehead and all of his cronies that 

821
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:38,500
he's stuffs into some office and has 
massive influence over all of us.

822
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,863
I think it's a giant problem.
It's a giant problem and to keep those 

823
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:43,584
people rotating back and forth from left
to right and it's not doing anybody any 

824
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:47,814
good,
but I think what's ironic about that is 

825
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:51,420
I think you'd have a lot of people agree
with you on both sides.

826
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,450
I think we need like a cOuncil of 
elders,

827
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,393
like we're.
We've been talking about this lately a 

828
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:59,190
lot like having a counselor of really 
fucking smart people.

829
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,290
You know?
Who would have on though,

830
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,240
would you have to cancel if you had a 
council of eight people?

831
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,313
Who would you put on a people you don't 
want seven because it's probably like 

832
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,763
titanic or something.

833
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,790
Some lucky,
weird number that.

834
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,710
I mean,
you'd need a good,

835
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,670
you'd need a good a doctor like just for
health stuff.

836
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:21,750
I like the dark dot mukherjee who wrote 
the emperor of all maladies,

837
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:23,940
uh,
any about sanjay gupta.

838
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,110
Like that guy.
Like I used to hate them and then I like

839
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,230
to,
I like siddhartha.

840
00:37:28,231 --> 00:37:29,064
I think he's a,
he's a real genius when it comes to 

841
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:32,274
stuff like that.
I think you need a good tech person 

842
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,190
because I think elon musk,
he's in ilan musk.

843
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,040
I'm a big fan of.
I'm a big fan of elon as well.

844
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:48,410
You know what he can do on his own.
It was just fucking amazing.

845
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:50,080
American tunnel.
he's tired.

846
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:53,550
Are you tired of the traffic in la?
Digging a giant tunnel.

847
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,300
I love elon musk.
elon musk.

848
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,270
I love elon musk.
I like the fact that like batteries,

849
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,040
you know?
Yeah.

850
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,410
The thing that was solar didn't work 
because the fucking storage didn't work,

851
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:05,071
so he's like,
fuck it,

852
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:08,280
I'm going to make them.
And he took the tesla battery thing into

853
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:09,660
a powerhouse.
The best battery in the world.

854
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:11,010
You're like,
you know what else I liked about him?

855
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,250
He married an actress twice with no 
prenup.

856
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,590
You married the same actress twice.
You know what that means?

857
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,573
That means he drinks and it fucks.
He drinks and he fucks because it's the 

858
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:22,410
only way you make those goddamn 
decisions.

859
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,360
You married that same actress twice with
no pre lump.

860
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,550
If he did that,
he's an animal.

861
00:38:27,551 --> 00:38:28,650
He's,
he's a savage.

862
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:29,670
He's in.
He's like,

863
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:31,230
I love you.
I don't give a fuck about a prenup.

864
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,460
Oh,
you came inside of her.

865
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,290
They fucking high five.
That's my kind of guy.

866
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,490
And he's making batteries.

867
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:41,800
Make them fucking good.
Battery charging stations everywhere.

868
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:43,420
You got to put him in.
Okay.

869
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,460
So we've got elon musk,
we got sanjay.

870
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,710
Meet your guy.
Siddhartha mukherjee.

871
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:50,110
But you need it.
You need a good common sense like,

872
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,810
do we have al gore,
al gore?

873
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,510
You know the criticism because of that 
movie,

874
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:56,344
like a lot of people.
I think he's thinking I'm an 

875
00:38:58,151 --> 00:38:58,984
environmentalist,
but I think he's too far too far over 

876
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,170
there.
I think you need to sort of,

877
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,240
if it was me,
you want someone,

878
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:09,220
you know who I like.
I like,

879
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,780
I like,
there's a guy named um,

880
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,973
Eric Schmidt and he's the chief or one 
of the head nasa scientists and these 

881
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:19,990
guys are just super smart dudes,
right?

882
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,930
Man and women actually because the head 
signed the chief scientist at nasa.

883
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,990
I met his mom.
She's fantastic as well,

884
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,333
but you just need like a common sense 
person who just goes in there with no 

885
00:39:32,441 --> 00:39:34,660
rhetoric or no politics or anything.

886
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,740
Just saying,
look,

887
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,980
we have to reduce emissions by 80 
percent if we don't,

888
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:41,200
we all die.
So here's what we're gonna do.

889
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:42,034
We're gonna,
get a lot of batteries and we're going 

890
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:45,020
to put the things on because the 
batteries can finally do it now.

891
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:45,854
And this is what we're going to do.
You need someone to do that because it 

892
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,463
gets when it gets hyper politicized and 
stuff and everything gets lost in the 

893
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:53,464
bullshit.
You just need a common sensical person 

894
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:55,714
who just says,
this is what needs to happen because 

895
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:02,350
this is what the science says.
The log jams that you must have,

896
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,710
like at a big corporation,
say if you worked for under armour,

897
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,720
like the log jams,
he must have.

898
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:09,490
You want to get something done.
It probably monumental.

899
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:12,130
it's probably a million people.
You try and talk about this and you have

900
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:15,220
to have design meetings and sit down and
try new fabric.

901
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,540
All this fucking socks.
Let me try thIs.

902
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,150
I was saying that I just imagined that 
in,

903
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,343
in politics,
in the country and trillions of dollars 

904
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:27,520
involved.
All these people.

905
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,110
Do you watch house of cards?
Yeah,

906
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,590
me too.
Love it.

907
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:33,160
I wish it was like that.
A lot of it maybe is.

908
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,810
Well,
I was watching actually,

909
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,003
ironically I was watching the lbj a 
documentary and what was interesting 

910
00:40:38,861 --> 00:40:43,720
about that was that here's this guy 
who's basically a political mechanic,

911
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,020
you know who's sitting there and 
everybody wants something.

912
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,480
Everybody you know is trying to get this
and try to.

913
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,100
And basically it's completely fucked and
you can't get anything done.

914
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,113
And the only thing that came across 
there was he got everything done by 

915
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,204
lying to everybody by just saying you.
I'm going to give you what you want and 

916
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:03,400
I'm going to give you what you want and 
I'm going to give you what you want.

917
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,740
And then just sort of figuring it out at
the end.

918
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,530
And it was,
I was just watching it.

919
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,573
It was fantastic because you're like,
that's probably the last era when you 

920
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:15,490
could actually get shit done.
And he was,

921
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,230
he was like,
I mean,

922
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,740
who knows because it's,
it was a movie,

923
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,380
but You know,
he was,

924
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,420
he was just sort of,
you know,

925
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,460
he was lIke the last of the,
you know,

926
00:41:24,461 --> 00:41:25,294
because I look at Frank Underwood and I 
always call him like he was a political 

927
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:28,714
mechanic.
He was the guy who could go get the 

928
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:32,260
votes and you could drum up the boats 
and you could do it.

929
00:41:32,261 --> 00:41:34,490
You know,
he reminds me actually talking about the

930
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,200
lead figure,
a kevin spacey,

931
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:37,770
kevin spacey,
house of cards.

932
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,280
He kinda,
without the sort of psychopath,

933
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:44,510
sociopath thing.
He reminds me of speaker boehner,

934
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,830
speaker boehner was that kind of got 
like,

935
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:46,760
how many votes do we need?

936
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,593
How do we get it in?
What do we trade off like they get an 

937
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:52,600
aircraft carrier plant in pittsburgh or 
whatever we get at this thing,

938
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,280
you know,
but it doesn't happen anymore.

939
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,080
Those kinds of guys don't happen 
anymore,

940
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,630
but why not?
I don't fucking know.

941
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:00,763
Well,
is that preferable to what we've got 

942
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:03,080
now?
I mean,

943
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,340
what?
Well,

944
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,220
because shit would actually get done.
I don't think she gets done now.

945
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:08,120
In fact,
they go backwards.

946
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:08,954
So to go back to the council of elders,
something needs to happen where there's 

947
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,030
some sort of change because it it like 
it's not going to fix itself,

948
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,590
right?
No one's going to fucking fail.

949
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,513
In fact,
in Washington now they're saying the 

950
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,404
biggest thing is the supreme court 
nomination because everything's so 

951
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:26,774
fucked and everybody realizes that that 
everything will have to go up to the 

952
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:30,224
supreme court and be decided there 
because it will not be decided in the 

953
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:34,850
senate and congress or an executive.

954
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,470
That's how fucked it is,
is that we're going.

955
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,333
That's what's really important because 
we gonna have to sue each other on 

956
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,190
everything we want to do.
Oh,

957
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:41,743
okay.
I got another member of our council of 

958
00:42:43,401 --> 00:42:44,234
elders,
neil degrasse tyson must be in their 

959
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,770
mustang.
He has to be in America.

960
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,950
Yeah.
Who else?

961
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:53,951
There's a guy that I would take two if 
you're looking at that kind of thing.

962
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,690
This guy,
uh,

963
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,660
um,
uh,

964
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,300
taylor wilson.
I did a thing.

965
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:58,840
He,
he,

966
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,673
he,
he built the fusion reactor in his 

967
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:03,650
garage when he was 14.
Yeah.

968
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:07,220
I heard that story.
And so I interviewed him.

969
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:08,210
What did they,
how did they find?

970
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,044
They found that the reactor,
like there was some sort of a reading 

971
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:11,900
they were getting.
No,

972
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:12,734
he was,
he was taking a energy off the grid and 

973
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,941
that's what it was,
right?

974
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:19,640
Yeah.
But then the government sort of took him

975
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,230
and now he's,
he's,

976
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,270
he's got his own lab and so he's a 
fantastic guy.

977
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,140
They found him.
Right?

978
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:26,780
Like there was some crazy power drain or
something.

979
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,733
I mean,
I shouldn't talk because I don't know 

980
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:31,010
the actual story,
but I remember they were like,

981
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:31,844
well,
I mean they know and because he was 

982
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:34,730
getting the materials and all this 
stuff,

983
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,600
taylor's nukes.
I was actually,

984
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,750
he was actually,
when he was 14,

985
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:44,820
he was getting,
he was plotting uranium mines.

986
00:43:44,821 --> 00:43:46,220
He figured out if you put like,
you know,

987
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,030
a white bottle with a thing and it says 
you're a,

988
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,500
you could plot the and he would go get 
uranium,

989
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,000
refine their uranium on his own,
into yellow cake and then make this,

990
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,760
this fusion reactor.
What kind of cancer doeS he have?

991
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,791
But he's,
you know,

992
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:02,624
he's got,
he's got all sorts of gear on when he 

993
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,690
does that.
All you need is a bunch of,

994
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,860
you know,
he's,

995
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,000
he's an expert,
but anyway,

996
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,150
he's 14.
But the whole thing with them that,

997
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:10,984
well now he's 23 but not.
But the thing is is he's into dark 

998
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:14,414
matter,
dark energy and he's going around the 

999
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:20,300
hydraulic collider and seren and I'm 
just like this kid,

1000
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,150
you know,
I think,

1001
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,610
I don't know if we've talked about this,
but yeah,

1002
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,790
look at him.
So he came up with the girl.

1003
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,260
The reason why the,
when he was younger,

1004
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,910
the reason why I liked him so much as he
came up with a failsafe reactor,

1005
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:36,440
little tiny one,
and he's like with all the sort of the,

1006
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,130
the,
the old um,

1007
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,730
power plants.
No,

1008
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,300
yeah,
they're,

1009
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,490
they're spent waste and the weapons that
we have to store,

1010
00:44:44,491 --> 00:44:46,890
which we can store it for more than a 
hundred years,

1011
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:48,720
but they need to be stored for 10,000
years.

1012
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,870
He can take little pea size bits of 
that,

1013
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:56,910
put it into fail safe reactor that sort 
of drains into a salt thing,

1014
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:58,980
whatever and it,
and it can't be whatever.

1015
00:44:58,981 --> 00:45:01,620
It's fail safe and,
but they are small,

1016
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:04,080
but they do like 50,000
houses or 100,000

1017
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:08,970
houses and just by using the fuel that 
we already have that we can store,

1018
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,850
we can power the world for the next 
10,000

1019
00:45:11,851 --> 00:45:13,980
years.
Oh jesus chrIst.

1020
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,200
So when I hear this,
and this is his thing,

1021
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:19,810
and by the way he's being backed by ilan
and all the big names and whatever.

1022
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,450
But the thing is,
is I'm like,

1023
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:23,970
I want that kid on my side.
Oh yeah,

1024
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,220
for sure.
I want that kid to sit there and say,

1025
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:30,360
how about we don't like eric schmidt's 
going to say not Eric Schmidt.

1026
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,560
What's his name?
Shit.

1027
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,300
Eric schmidt is a glue.
It's anyway,

1028
00:45:33,301 --> 00:45:36,510
somebody schmidt from nasa,
Dr.

1029
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,910
Schmidt is going to say is going to say,
hey,

1030
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:40,530
we need to reduce,
you know,

1031
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,480
emissions by 80 percent of all going to 
die.

1032
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,010
And then taylor goes,
got it.

1033
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,600
You know,
we do these,

1034
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,261
these,
uh,

1035
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:49,860
these little reactors and we,
when we eat up all the old,

1036
00:45:49,861 --> 00:45:50,910
uh,
warheads and we're done.

1037
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,913
Yeah,
they can turn them into batteries that 

1038
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:54,030
last for the,
pull that up.

1039
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,150
They turned them into batteries made out
of diamonds.

1040
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,290
That lasts for thousands of years.
And so you just,

1041
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,880
you just want somebody to say,
god,

1042
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,720
here's what its overall it out.
Boom.

1043
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:05,823
What's always made sense to me that If 
we were putting carbon out in the 

1044
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:08,304
atmosphere and carbons valuable for 
construction and a lot of different 

1045
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:11,740
things,
there's got to be a way.

1046
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:14,880
BIofuels,
like so if you want to do bio fuels,

1047
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,230
it's all,
it's all,

1048
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:18,410
it's all carbon you need to ceo to,
to,

1049
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,373
to inject into the biofuels and you're 
like refined to carbon out of the 

1050
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:26,730
goddamn atmosphere when they make 
biodiesel with corn and shit like that.

1051
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,780
The,
there's a,

1052
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,640
there's the one that you use.
Algae.

1053
00:46:29,641 --> 00:46:30,474
The algae.
Yeah.

1054
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,860
Diamonds turn nuclear waste into nuclear
battery go jesus christ.

1055
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:38,430
See if you can pull up taylor's a 
reactor thing.

1056
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,080
It's,
it's fast.

1057
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:41,940
I would kind of solve all of our 
problem.

1058
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,313
I mean,
it really would mean that we no longer 

1059
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,980
got to react.
It's like his reactor that uses a,

1060
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,070
spent a,
he did a ted talk on it anyway.

1061
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,343
Um,
so we need him because whenever I'm 

1062
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:58,920
around him I feel better about humanity 
because I'm like,

1063
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:02,340
this is just so devastating and,
and I don't know how to fix it.

1064
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:02,960
He goes,
well,

1065
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,260
the science is there.
You can do it tomorrow.

1066
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:04,971
You just got to duh,
dah duh duh,

1067
00:47:04,971 --> 00:47:05,804
duh.
And you're like,

1068
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,890
oh,
how do we get that done?

1069
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,580
We've got to keep that 23 year old kid 
away from pussy us.

1070
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,470
We gotta do we got to keep them 
productive,

1071
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,773
you know,
because some girl that wrecked elon 

1072
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:17,450
musk,
that same type of guy.

1073
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,860
Well,
he loves doing strong.

1074
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:23,480
We all know he's,
he's good.

1075
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,710
Some of them.
Who else we lose the good ones.

1076
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,800
Who have these nikola tesla.
You need like a philosopher king,

1077
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:31,750
kind of like big picture.
Sam harris,

1078
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,040
globalist,
globalist.

1079
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:36,070
I want sam harris on the bar.
So sam harris,

1080
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,950
he must be council of elders.
A lot of people right now on reddit,

1081
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,370
on twitter.
It's interesting.

1082
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:43,204
Who is,
who is someone that's just got a big 

1083
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:46,324
picture,
understands everything that's going to 

1084
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:49,504
sort of smooth out everything.
It's really hard to find people like 

1085
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:54,130
that.
It's really hard to find people that um,

1086
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,670
it's really hard to find people that are
open to the facts,

1087
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:58,563
that are willing to change their mind,
aren't attached their ideas and willing 

1088
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:04,060
to look at every side of things before 
they form an opinion.

1089
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,890
Most people don't have the time to do 
that.

1090
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:06,724
That's part of the issue.
Part of the issue I think when anyone 

1091
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:09,344
who went to talking about anything 
related to the environment or politics 

1092
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:12,184
or gender or race or anything is there 
is only so much fucking time in the 

1093
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:16,804
world so it's so much easier to form 
this prejudice opinion or this 

1094
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:22,930
predetermined opinion on everything 
across the board,

1095
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,510
which is why I like being on the right 
is so popular.

1096
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,673
It's so easy to dismiss it,
but he's a bunch of babies and shit on 

1097
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,220
them,
you know,

1098
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:31,054
and it's much easier to shit on.
Things tend to say here's a solution 

1099
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,750
much.
That's why I like taylor.

1100
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:36,310
I'm like,
this fucking kid.

1101
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:38,400
Like he can just,
he's just like,

1102
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:40,510
not only is the science there,
we can do this,

1103
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:41,111
this,
this and this.

1104
00:48:41,111 --> 00:48:42,190
And I'm like,
well why don't we do that?

1105
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,450
And he goes,
politics,

1106
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:44,201
money,
this,

1107
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:49,201
that could have a baby drill.
start drilling into.

1108
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:51,443
It's interesting though,
it's interesting that we cannot think 

1109
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:57,670
between the two of us have someone who 
could just be,

1110
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,313
you know,
someone is just unbelievable and people 

1111
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:06,221
could just go,
okay,

1112
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:07,280
I get it.
You know,

1113
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,640
someone is really wise.
Someone,

1114
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,790
they don't necessarily have to be smart 
and,

1115
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,660
and also just like they can,
they can convey,

1116
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,070
you know,
this is what we're doing,

1117
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:21,320
this is why we're here because you need 
a communicator because you know,

1118
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,890
taylor and elan are not going to be 
communicating,

1119
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,960
you know,
batteries and,

1120
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,730
and the,
and the physics behind,

1121
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,250
you know,
the little piece and the thing when,

1122
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:31,360
I mean you need someone to say,
this is what we're doing,

1123
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:33,490
this is why we're doing it.
This is why everybody in the world,

1124
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,593
like who is the best,
most believable politician in the last 

1125
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:38,290
50 years?

1126
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,850
Who,
who is going to be that person?

1127
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,410
Jimmy carter globally,
globally.

1128
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,520
It's funny about jimmy carter because 
I've never met anyone as sort of quick,

1129
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,600
you know,
he's so,

1130
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,433
he's like,
I don't know how you'd use it for an 

1131
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,400
hour or so many so fast.
And he's got the stats.

1132
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:53,020
He's got twitter and he's just,
he,

1133
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,120
he looks and he sounds like the perfect 
president.

1134
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,380
He was destroyed when he was empowered.
Like he was just vilified.

1135
00:49:59,381 --> 00:50:01,570
So you're like,
he was a great smart guy.

1136
00:50:01,571 --> 00:50:02,404
He,
he should have been like a secretary 

1137
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:04,660
general,
you understand that you don't know about

1138
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:06,330
president.
He was um,

1139
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,230
as a,
as his character,

1140
00:50:08,231 --> 00:50:10,270
like how he,
how he presents himself.

1141
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,500
He was not like a firm leader character,
you know,

1142
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:18,140
he was a kind gentleman from Georgia 
peanut fall and a smart,

1143
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,670
smart gen,
genuinely genuinely smart dude.

1144
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:24,550
And with a good moral center.

1145
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:25,683
He was worked and he was working towards
the end by the reagan administration 

1146
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:30,734
when they were coming in the reagan 
campaign because they were the first 

1147
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:37,901
campaign to ever use the rights 
connection to christianity.

1148
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,313
This is the first time they had 
organized the hardcore religious base 

1149
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,740
even though,
you know,

1150
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:47,180
he was a pastor.
I know,

1151
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:48,950
it's kind of crazy.
It's kind kinda crazy.

1152
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:55,050
And the republicans connected themselves
to these crazy like televangelists jerry

1153
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,190
falwell and.
Yeah,

1154
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,750
exactly.
Have you got elected?

1155
00:50:59,751 --> 00:51:02,220
Because he could,
he could get the evangelical base.

1156
00:51:02,221 --> 00:51:04,190
So they worked him there.
They worked him there.

1157
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:07,790
And ronald reagan was an actor.
He was a much better public speaker.

1158
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:08,624
He was strong.
He had slicked back hair like god damn 

1159
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:12,260
comic book from the fifties.
I mean,

1160
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:13,280
he was,
yeah,

1161
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:14,323
because he was,
he was like the president and in many 

1162
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:18,230
cases is the queen of england.

1163
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,220
It's a,
it's a ceremonial thing and that's,

1164
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,253
that's why I'm saying you need a 
communicator who can sort of get things 

1165
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:27,410
across and,
but people will believe,

1166
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,273
like nobody really believed carter and 
half the country didn't believe reagan 

1167
00:51:30,981 --> 00:51:32,690
or they believed him after he was gone,
you know,

1168
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:35,390
because everyone's like,
that's convenient to love reagan now.

1169
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,880
But I remember,
and you remember when we were kids,

1170
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:40,160
he was like,
that's what punk rock started in America

1171
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,420
was because right.
And got in.

1172
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:43,880
We all went fucking New York hardcore 
and all that shit.

1173
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,110
But,
you know,

1174
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:45,990
I just,
it's,

1175
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:47,870
it's,
it's a shame that we cannot think.

1176
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,150
It doesn't have to be american.
What about like in the world,

1177
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,540
isn't there somebody in the world and 
the fucking world hard pressed,

1178
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:57,500
hard pressed to find a prominent public 
figure that really stands out.

1179
00:51:57,501 --> 00:51:59,700
That's pretty interesting.
That's oprah.

1180
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,140
No,
no,

1181
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,030
no,
I'm just kidding.

1182
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,660
Um,
yeah man,

1183
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:06,490
it's uh,
it's.

1184
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,323
Oh,
the other thing that carter got fucked 

1185
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:08,954
on was the hostages.
They had negotiated the release of the 

1186
00:52:11,241 --> 00:52:15,740
hostages to make sure that it was done 
once reagan was in office and not before

1187
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:17,990
that,
and they had kept those fucking american

1188
00:52:17,991 --> 00:52:19,450
citizens over there.
They,

1189
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,393
I mean this is a proven conspiracy.
They kept those american citizens over 

1190
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:24,194
there longer than they had to be because
they wanted to make sure that it will 

1191
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,890
all look good.
You had,

1192
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,470
you had that happened,
which was not good.

1193
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,333
You also had,
I mean there's also an economic timing 

1194
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:36,530
issue and you had this oil crisis and 
you had a recession.

1195
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:38,640
You have all these bad things happening 
and you're like,

1196
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,613
well that's carter's fault,
and it was also when they ruined 

1197
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:42,860
american cars.
There you go.

1198
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,810
They all turned to shit.
American cars in 19 sixties up until the

1199
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:48,800
early seventies were fucking awesome.

1200
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,663
They're the best looking cars and to 
this day they're like the biggest 

1201
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:53,174
collector.
Cars like barracudas and corvettes and 

1202
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:58,470
all those old cars.
As soon as that gas crisis hit,

1203
00:52:58,471 --> 00:52:59,900
man,
those cars turned to shit.

1204
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,840
While also same thing.
Every time there's a gas crisis,

1205
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:04,940
so that's when the japanese cars became 
popular.

1206
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:05,774
That's when it's the exact same thing,
you know the suv where the highest 

1207
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,153
sellers before the last oil crisis or 
when the went through the roof and then 

1208
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,500
that's when the prius,
they couldn't,

1209
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:19,334
they couldn't make them fast enough.
It was exactly the same thing that 

1210
00:53:22,251 --> 00:53:24,920
happened in the late seventies.
So I think anyway,

1211
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,010
it was a princess is a

1212
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,150
far better car.
Then the 19 eighties,

1213
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:32,970
the dislike taken.
They took one of the best cars ever.

1214
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,160
Like the from steve mcqueen bullet.
Remember that?

1215
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,860
Fuck yeah.
That was a 68.

1216
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,813
I think it was [inaudible] 68 mustang 
got damn was a gorgeous piece of metal 

1217
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:45,240
and they turned that into these 19 
eighties things that he likes.

1218
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:46,650
Like,
what the fuck happened?

1219
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,530
What did you do?
I look at a lot of stuff and say,

1220
00:53:49,531 --> 00:53:51,210
what the fuck?
What the fuck?

1221
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,280
Like the late seventies mustang.
Find like,

1222
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:54,114
uh,
that's,

1223
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,130
that's the shit.
Come on man.

1224
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,270
That's.
Oh,

1225
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:00,420
I thought was steve mcqueen.
60 eight fastback.

1226
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,890
I like,
I like to block one.

1227
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,530
I like them all.
I love them.

1228
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:05,863
This one of the,
something about american muscle cars 

1229
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:09,470
from the sixties and the early 
seventies.

1230
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:10,380
Mustang there.
Yeah,

1231
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,600
that's it.
Fucking steve mcqueen baby.

1232
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:17,130
Look at that goddamn parker.
So you go from that.

1233
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:22,130
Now type up 1980 mustang prepared to 
throw out to get ready to puke.

1234
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,720
Here we go.
Oh my god.

1235
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,760
What in the fuck is that hunk of shit.
Fuck how the fuck.

1236
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:36,240
NoBody wants that car.
That car is worth three cents.

1237
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:40,230
Nobody wants that fucking car.
I think I actually like,

1238
00:54:40,231 --> 00:54:41,220
uh,
you know,

1239
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:45,150
people who like logan's run and all that
stuff like those old,

1240
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:47,730
uh,
a seventies futurists,

1241
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,560
they would like to know even,
um,

1242
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,263
even those dummies,
they just made some terrible fucking 

1243
00:54:55,711 --> 00:54:58,650
cars in the 19,
late seventies and put that away.

1244
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:01,050
You're making me throw up there you go.
Oh they,

1245
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:02,080
they,
they can't.

1246
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,480
Something happens.
It's interesting.

1247
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:06,060
So on our council of elders,
we don't have one politician.

1248
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:07,620
Okay.
So now we can have one of those.

1249
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:12,100
So we got those people are good doctors.
We got some good scientists,

1250
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:14,110
we got a tech guy,
we got some visionaries.

1251
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,470
Well,
we need more than one tech need.

1252
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,900
Probably gonna need some tech guy to 
balance out.

1253
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,910
Ilan,
ilan might get a little wacky,

1254
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,820
start sending people to mars and shit.

1255
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:24,683
Now here's the other thing is,
is a council of elders for the world or 

1256
00:55:26,841 --> 00:55:29,400
for the country,
because then you also need some military

1257
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:34,640
dudes to say when we can we,
we like the one thing that you know,

1258
00:55:36,631 --> 00:55:37,310
that,
that,

1259
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:42,310
that is sort of whatever a true truism 
is that you have to,

1260
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:46,380
you have to preach that sort of.
There is no democracy without safety.

1261
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:47,410
Right?
Right.

1262
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,243
That's true.
And you and you have to have guaranteed 

1263
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:52,650
sort of protection.
And if you look at europe,

1264
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:54,180
it's quite interesting because when 
they,

1265
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,590
when they sort of said,
okay,

1266
00:55:55,591 --> 00:55:56,390
we've got,
you know,

1267
00:55:56,390 --> 00:56:00,090
we were going to protect this area and 
we're going to.

1268
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,190
There was an economic benefit for this 
area.

1269
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,203
You had all the little groups start to 
say like scotland or the basque 

1270
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:08,280
country's or catalonia or you know,
all these different say,

1271
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:10,530
well we want to split off,
right?

1272
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:15,710
Because it's more democratic to have 
smaller sort of runnable countries that.

1273
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:17,724
And they're like,
well we want to have our own thing 

1274
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:19,980
because we'll be part of this bigger 
thing,

1275
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,203
but we want to be more democratic and I 
think that's quite because you have 

1276
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:24,544
these super national political entities 
that sort of guarantee safety and 

1277
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:30,160
economic security and then therefore 
it's much more democratic.

1278
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:31,630
So you sort of sit there and say,
okay,

1279
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:35,560
well if that's the case then you have to
have that guarantee security.

1280
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,120
So,
so how do you do that?

1281
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,720
Well this is the ultimate goal and this 
is going to take several generations and

1282
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:47,970
all nations treat each other now because
we are so big and we are so connected.

1283
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,660
Treat each other now as one,
one organism,

1284
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,583
one gigantic super organism,
the human race and all this country 

1285
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:57,574
bullshit.
Let difficult to be back and we'll have 

1286
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,850
an insanely it almost impossible to do 
it.

1287
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,693
Look,
I'm saying

1288
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:06,340
unless there's a w,
where was I going to go back to?

1289
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:10,900
It was like we're great at like war.
Like when there's a world fuck we got to

1290
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:14,470
go get them.
You know what if or let's say,

1291
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,360
so I view it like this.
But like,

1292
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:18,820
let's say there's a fucking asteroid 
coming towards us,

1293
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,410
like we're going to put all over the 
global,

1294
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:21,400
you know,
like a movie.

1295
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:23,010
We're going to put everybody,
the smartest guys,

1296
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:23,853
the russian guys,
chinese guys and us and everybody's 

1297
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:28,690
going to go off and do this thing.
So if that's the case,

1298
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:31,390
and I always say humans aren't going to 
move unless we have a gun to her head,

1299
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:35,710
but at some point what happens is,
let's say greenland,

1300
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:40,330
a big chunk about four feet.
Miami goes away and everybody goes,

1301
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,610
oh shit,
now we got to do something.

1302
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,770
At that point,
everybody goes,

1303
00:57:44,771 --> 00:57:46,570
okay,
you know,

1304
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,730
because if,
if miami goes away,

1305
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:49,564
shanghai goes away.

1306
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,480
So then shang shanghai goes away.
It goes away.

1307
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,150
And so if you're sitting there,
you go,

1308
00:57:54,151 --> 00:57:54,984
okay,
everybody's going to get together and 

1309
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:56,374
say shit,
the oceans rise and we got to do 

1310
00:57:58,451 --> 00:57:59,820
something.
We gotta do something right now.

1311
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:02,440
But there's always gonna be people that 
are ignoring that and profiting.

1312
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:03,274
Somebody else can take care of it.
Let's start drilling and they're going 

1313
00:58:04,871 --> 00:58:06,500
to do that.
They're going to do that short.

1314
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:09,880
Don't you think though,
that if mumbai goes away,

1315
00:58:09,881 --> 00:58:11,920
miami goes away in New York,
goes away,

1316
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,170
whatever,
and all the seed,

1317
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:15,910
the big seat next to the cease cities go
away.

1318
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:21,230
Now this is interesting because when we 
were shooting this a doc on on sea level

1319
00:58:22,061 --> 00:58:22,894
rise,
one of the things that's damning to oil 

1320
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:26,340
companies is they're like,
wow,

1321
00:58:26,341 --> 00:58:27,174
I didn't know science has not decided.
We didn't fucking know while this was 

1322
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:31,630
happening.

1323
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:32,463
They raised spending hundreds of 
millions of dollars more billions of 

1324
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:36,483
dollars.
They raised all their oil platforms by 

1325
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,200
eight feet.
Ooh,

1326
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,493
why?
Because they didn't want them getting 

1327
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:47,581
sunk because jesus,
the outside prediction so that they have

1328
00:58:47,681 --> 00:58:49,490
to last 80 years for insurance,
you know,

1329
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:50,343
for the life of things.
So the outside prediction For 100 years 

1330
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:55,030
was eight feet.
That's four feet,

1331
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:57,610
three feet to four feet,
and then the outside is eight feet.

1332
00:58:58,210 --> 00:58:58,961
So they're like,
okay,

1333
00:58:58,961 --> 00:59:01,850
well just do eight feet.
So they know.

1334
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:06,250
So they know if you don't raise 
something and pay hundreds of dollars to

1335
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,280
raise it eight feet by eight feet,
why not four feet?

1336
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:12,040
Why not three feet wide,
12 feet in any case?

1337
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,560
So you this.
The thing is is you sit there and say,

1338
00:59:14,561 --> 00:59:16,660
okay,
eight feet at four feet,

1339
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:18,580
miami's gone.
New york's gone.

1340
00:59:18,581 --> 00:59:20,950
Shane at eight feet were all sitting 
there.

1341
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:26,200
Okay.
It probably gets to paint canyon fucking

1342
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:27,530
eight feet.

1343
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,140
It probably gets.
So at that point humanity goes,

1344
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,350
holy shit,
we need taylor,

1345
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,660
we need ilan.
And we did a.

1346
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:33,943
And so that's an interesting point.
I think that ultimately what is gonna 

1347
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,520
happen and it may take 100 years,
it may take 500 years.

1348
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:41,743
I think ultimately we're going to reach 
a technologically driven state of 

1349
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:49,340
evolution that bypasses our biological 
evolution.

1350
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:52,160
So I've got an answer to that.
I agree.

1351
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,233
Half the world will do that.
Maybe the other half the world goes the 

1352
00:59:57,621 --> 01:00:00,800
opposite way.
Maybe that's what's happening now,

1353
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,840
but it's not happening now with cell 
phones.

1354
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:05,650
Cell phones have gone all over the world
and if this,

1355
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:06,583
if we can achieve a technology that 
allows people to understand each other 

1356
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,830
in a,
in a way that's way more way,

1357
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:18,320
way deeper and more intimate than just 
getting to know somebody.

1358
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,150
They talked to you,
you talked to me,

1359
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:21,440
you know,
like we,

1360
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:24,980
you and I have been friends for a long 
time now and every time I see a give you

1361
01:00:24,981 --> 01:00:25,940
a big hug,
I know,

1362
01:00:25,941 --> 01:00:26,600
I see shane.

1363
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,510
I'm going to give him a hug.
I associate you with my friend.

1364
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,240
It's happiness.
We have a lot of great talks.

1365
01:00:32,241 --> 01:00:34,430
We get drunk together and that's all 
built in,

1366
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,220
but it takes a while to establish that,
right?

1367
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:37,243
It takes a while to make a bond between 
two people who enjoy each other's 

1368
01:00:40,191 --> 01:00:41,024
company.
I think we could all this whole world 

1369
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:46,460
could be a bunch of friends.
It sounds crazy,

1370
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,850
but it can be done,
will be done in small groups.

1371
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,160
It can be done in this room.
It can be done in this town.

1372
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,650
I think it can be done.
If we're facing extinction,

1373
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,240
I don't think it can be done otherwise 
because I.

1374
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:00,390
What I see happening to go back to if we
don't have war,

1375
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:03,650
like global war we have,
we have this eating ourselves.

1376
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:04,880
So again,
if you look at the world,

1377
01:01:04,881 --> 01:01:09,881
you have half the world roughly saying 
technology can fix us.

1378
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,173
We're going to go to mars,
we're gonna have little pellets of 

1379
01:01:13,311 --> 01:01:15,980
things which are going to feed 50 
houses.

1380
01:01:15,981 --> 01:01:16,814
We're going to do this,
and then you have the other half of the 

1381
01:01:19,071 --> 01:01:22,850
world that saying fuck reading.
You know,

1382
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:27,851
fuck technology.
We're going back to another time.

1383
01:01:28,011 --> 01:01:28,844
And not just not just the muslim world.
You have lots of different groups in 

1384
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:34,710
africa.
You have lots of different groups in and

1385
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:35,623
obviously the middle east you have 
different groups who are saying fuck 

1386
01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:38,240
that.
We're not doing that.

1387
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:39,463
And so they're moving away from it.
So you have this sort of duopoly in the 

1388
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:43,244
world of people who are going one way 
and the people who are going the other 

1389
01:01:45,531 --> 01:01:47,840
way.
And I don't think that unless you have a

1390
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:50,120
common goal,
which is by the way,

1391
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:52,640
we're all going to die unless we do 
this,

1392
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,420
that everybody does it and it's like 
star trek and star trek,

1393
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,254
they did this thing where,
where everybody from the world is 

1394
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:00,614
finally together and then we're all 
working together for this great thing 

1395
01:02:02,421 --> 01:02:05,000
which is exploring space,
but they needed that whole,

1396
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:09,110
you know,
focus that goal and I think we need that

1397
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:10,730
focus and that go,
which is why,

1398
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,080
again,
to go back to war zones,

1399
01:02:12,081 --> 01:02:13,340
when you go to war zones says,
oh shit,

1400
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:15,080
we shouldn't be fucking dropping bombs 
on each other.

1401
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,360
And then when you go and talk to 
scientists,

1402
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:17,841
they go,
oh,

1403
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:21,120
it's coming and it's coming fucked.
And now,

1404
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:24,120
yeah.
And that I'm not like this crazy dude or

1405
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:25,440
whatever.
I'm just a regular dude going,

1406
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:26,303
oh shit,
it's because I talk to these scientists 

1407
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:32,160
were like,
we just did this thing in Russia where,

1408
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:34,680
uh,
I don't know if you know about this,

1409
01:02:34,681 --> 01:02:36,630
but the permafrost,
if you heard about the permafrost,

1410
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,493
yes.
All the carbon in the permafrost is 

1411
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:41,610
released.
It's going to be released as melting and

1412
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:45,230
so it releases carbon,
it actually releases methane,

1413
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,073
which is 20 times worse than carbon and 
there's more carbon in the permafrost 

1414
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:55,140
than all of the carbon that we've 
released since the industrial revolution

1415
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,003
started because it's a bunch of dead 
thinGs that have died up there for 

1416
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:01,160
millions of years.
Correct.

1417
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,500
And all that's going to get warmed up.
Correct.

1418
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:08,520
And it's gonna be a bunch of stinky dead
bodies and animal shit.

1419
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:11,010
Do you want to know two interesting 
things about that?

1420
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,950
Well,
I got two interesting things about that.

1421
01:03:13,951 --> 01:03:18,951
One is we went up to lakes in both 
Russia and the arctic and you pop a hole

1422
01:03:20,731 --> 01:03:21,564
in the lake and you put a.
You put a like a torch in and it shoots 

1423
01:03:24,331 --> 01:03:25,890
out like a,
like an oil flare.

1424
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,400
Oh my god.
Oh,

1425
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:30,510
I've seen that because there's methane 
in the lake,

1426
01:03:30,511 --> 01:03:33,540
in the water and it just shooting out 
like an oil flair.

1427
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:34,920
And you're like,
what the fuck?

1428
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:38,070
A b.
This is gonna sound crazy.

1429
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:42,960
But it's actually fucking true in that.
So we go to siberia and we hang out with

1430
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:44,640
this dude who's been living in the 
permafrost,

1431
01:03:44,641 --> 01:03:48,400
he's like the world's biggest expert on 
permafrost and it's scientists,

1432
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,460
scientists,
and there's all these slumps,

1433
01:03:50,461 --> 01:03:52,800
like they have the biggest slump in,
in,

1434
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:53,910
in,
in the world,

1435
01:03:53,911 --> 01:03:54,744
in a slump.

1436
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:59,310
So it's where the permafrost melts in.
The permafrost is like frozen ground,

1437
01:03:59,311 --> 01:04:02,070
like dirt and shit.
It's also frozen water.

1438
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:05,940
And so when it melts,
the water goes away and the ground which

1439
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:09,810
has left sort of slump and it goes down 
like 20 or 30 feet.

1440
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:12,130
And so you just had these all over 
siberia.

1441
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,590
You have these huge,
like two,

1442
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:14,730
three,
four mile wide,

1443
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:17,420
just like craters,
you know.

1444
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,160
And so he's there and he's like the sort
of foremost expert.

1445
01:04:23,161 --> 01:04:25,860
And what's interesting about is he goes,
look in the ice age,

1446
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:27,900
here's what happened.
There were not that many humans,

1447
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,500
but there were millions upon millions of
animals and they were like elk.

1448
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:32,334
And there were,
you know,

1449
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,430
caribou and all this shit.
And the wooly mammoth.

1450
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,293
You know what they did,
they ate all the fucking shrubs and the 

1451
01:04:38,881 --> 01:04:41,010
trees and shit.
Which actually,

1452
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:42,363
you know,
made the ground freeze much deeper 

1453
01:04:45,001 --> 01:04:47,940
because there's a lot of things like 
dark sort of,

1454
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:48,803
you know,
brings in a heat and it takes the 

1455
01:04:52,171 --> 01:04:52,890
installation away.

1456
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:54,280
All theSe stuffs,
the foliage is not,

1457
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:57,480
the sun beats directly down to earth.
And so.

1458
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:00,960
So anyways,
he no because no,

1459
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:04,800
because the trees bringing the heat and 
hold it in the act,

1460
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:08,820
it freezes more in the winter and then 
therefore stays colder in any case.

1461
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:10,231
So he's like,
look,

1462
01:05:10,231 --> 01:05:11,064
here's what we have to do.
We have to put millions of caribou and 

1463
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:18,021
millions of horses and millions of elk 
can stop up in siberia.

1464
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:19,630
But he goes,
that's yeah,

1465
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:21,130
that'll get you 60 percent of the way 
there.

1466
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:25,540
The only thing that'll get us really 
there is the fucking woolly mammoth.

1467
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:27,090
Now this is not a joke.
What?

1468
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:31,990
So ironically they found a woolly 
mammoth,

1469
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:32,943
perfectly preserved in the permafrost.
Like it fell into a fucking lake and 

1470
01:05:36,551 --> 01:05:40,300
froze and never a thought out thought.
So when they,

1471
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:43,600
then they opened it up,
it still had red cells living cells.

1472
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,350
So you know they're doing this is we 
have,

1473
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,880
we shot this and I was watching this 
with my mouth on the ground.

1474
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:54,390
They're cloning the wooly mAmmoths.
Skin found well preserved and permafrost

1475
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:58,150
gives new hope.
a trump look up the trunk.

1476
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:01,060
Look up the show.
They have a trunk.

1477
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:03,610
They have a full jesus look at it,
look it up there,

1478
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:06,230
the image,
but they have a full truck look up.

1479
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,330
Woolly mammoth trunk.
Wow.

1480
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,680
Because they have this full trunk that,
that,

1481
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,020
that there.
That's.

1482
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:15,220
No,
no.

1483
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:18,310
They have a trunk.
Like I have a full trunk.

1484
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:21,460
In any case,
they're trying to clone using tusk,

1485
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,920
tusk.
They go,

1486
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,730
oh,
you're a trunk.

1487
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:27,130
Why did it pull up tusk hunters for the 
first thing.

1488
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:29,290
ThAt's weird.
They're trying to say anyway,

1489
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:31,510
so they're cloning either with the south
koreans.

1490
01:06:31,511 --> 01:06:36,400
They're cloning mammoths in the hopes 
that they're just going to put all these

1491
01:06:36,401 --> 01:06:39,010
clones of mammoths up there and it's 
going to freeze.

1492
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:41,920
The permafrost is just make more shit 
and more dead animals,

1493
01:06:41,921 --> 01:06:44,380
which makes more methane.
I'm so confused.

1494
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,333
Well,
the amount that they would make versus 

1495
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:52,030
the amount of methane that's going to be
released from the permafrost,

1496
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,864
which has been collecting this shit for 
fucking millions of years because 

1497
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:58,900
diminimous.
So the idea is they're going to beat the

1498
01:06:58,901 --> 01:07:02,080
fuck out of all the vegetation that will
cool the area down.

1499
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,580
Correct.
Wow.

1500
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:04,543
Correct.
Why don't they just make ice cubes and 

1501
01:07:07,241 --> 01:07:10,000
just dumped them out of helicopters?
It seems like just as good evaluator.

1502
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:11,263
It'll make fucking.
There's another guy we need for our 

1503
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:15,580
council is this fucking crazy russian 
dude who's just up there saying,

1504
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:17,470
fuck it.
Let's get some mammoths to fix us.

1505
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:18,773
I wonder.
And that'll get you 60 percent of the 

1506
01:07:19,631 --> 01:07:21,490
way there,
but still 40 percent fucked.

1507
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:23,950
No,
with us we Get 90 percent.

1508
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:25,570
Oh,
so the 60 percent.

1509
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:27,490
Sixty percent.
There you go.

1510
01:07:27,491 --> 01:07:28,870
There you go.
There's the trunk.

1511
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,730
wow.
That is so crazy.

1512
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,440
She,
yeah,

1513
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,140
they have a good chance of successfully 
colonial.

1514
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:37,480
They have south koreans and the russians
and the russians are moving very fast on

1515
01:07:37,481 --> 01:07:40,420
this because they realized that if 
permafrost melts,

1516
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:41,254
they're screwed.
So do they keep this thing in a frozen 

1517
01:07:43,121 --> 01:07:44,050
room?
They do,

1518
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,150
we filmed it,
we filmed them trying to clone it.

1519
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:49,840
Wow.
What a crazy time to be alive.

1520
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,083
So amazed.
Because what's amazing about that is 

1521
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:52,691
like,
oh,

1522
01:07:52,691 --> 01:07:54,100
we're fucked.
The permafrost to melt.

1523
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:55,420
We're all doomed.
And then you're like,

1524
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:59,040
but we can get some fucking woolly 
mammoths and mammoths.

1525
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:02,770
You need to make saber tooth tigers to 
just for the fuck of it.

1526
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,110
Well,
there could be an argument there because

1527
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:05,950
you're like,
well,

1528
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:06,813
who's going to eat the mammoth?
Because we actually talked to nasa and 

1529
01:08:08,381 --> 01:08:09,400
said,
is this guy crazy?

1530
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,233
As he liked don quixote tilting at 
windmills and he said actually the 

1531
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,960
environmental or the organic solution 
rather than dropping ice cubes,

1532
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:21,830
that all coverage is the best solution 
because it used to be that 40,000

1533
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:25,220
years ago this shit regulated itself and
this is when the planet was cold.

1534
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:26,054
Now it's too fucking hot.
So this is a way to get back to being 

1535
01:08:28,701 --> 01:08:30,230
cold.
So it actually makes sense.

1536
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,740
So we need that guy really that he's on 
our council.

1537
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:34,903
We need some people from other countries
that they're gonna get mad at us 

1538
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:37,820
because,
uh,

1539
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:41,150
well maybe we shouldn't.
Maybe we should have our fucking country

1540
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:42,720
figure this out.
It's too.

1541
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:45,320
It's too much.
We'll spend into fix the world.

1542
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:47,360
I think you need.
You need,

1543
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,000
you need other people.
Can we need some checks?

1544
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:50,863
Go on,
go get some checks on their chicks are 

1545
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:52,820
going to get pissed.

1546
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:53,900
They're already march.
And dude,

1547
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,270
we need checks in calgary.
Who do we got?

1548
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:58,730
Nobody.
Unfortunately,

1549
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,170
oprah.
Oprah.

1550
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:03,710
Maybe you know what oprah is good at.
You know what?

1551
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:04,544
You just hit the nail on the head 
because she's great at sort of regular 

1552
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:07,971
whether she's.
No,

1553
01:09:07,971 --> 01:09:10,490
she's great at,
at getting a message across.

1554
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,660
She's great at saying,
hey,

1555
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:14,120
this is the thing and this is why it's 
happening.

1556
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:16,610
So taylor goes,
oh shit,

1557
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,870
you know,
we've got this,

1558
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:18,704
uh,
this a reactor that we can do that cost 

1559
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:21,860
10 bucks.
And then she goes,

1560
01:09:21,861 --> 01:09:22,910
okay,
this is why we're doing it.

1561
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,020
Okay.
So who else?

1562
01:09:24,021 --> 01:09:27,290
What other checks?
Oprah is very good.

1563
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:29,870
I like that as our,
as our politicians get mad when you call

1564
01:09:29,871 --> 01:09:32,120
them chicks yet,
so that's still okay.

1565
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,040
When,
when do I become a pig?

1566
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,580
forgotten.
I'm just not good.

1567
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,430
It's not good to call them chicks.

1568
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,033
No.
Why is it good to call joe Biden to 

1569
01:09:40,921 --> 01:09:42,380
dude?
He's a good dude.

1570
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:43,870
Is not all right.
Yeah,

1571
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:44,773
he's a good dude.
So why isn't it okay to call hillary 

1572
01:09:46,131 --> 01:09:46,640
clinton?
Well,

1573
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,473
She's a fiery check.
I think it's good when you're calling 

1574
01:09:49,071 --> 01:09:49,750
people like,
you know,

1575
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:54,270
with their buddies and tHeir friends.
What about getting into.

1576
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:56,230
We call women chicks,
but.

1577
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,570
But I think we need another 
international.

1578
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:03,710
We need an international person.
I end hirsi ali.

1579
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,900
Alright,
that's good.

1580
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:06,980
There you go.
Yeah.

1581
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:07,893
Yeah.
She would be amazing with foreign 

1582
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:13,931
relations and understanding people of 
our religious ideologies.

1583
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,380
Okay.
Who else?

1584
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:23,620
Sitting down the super liberals get mad 
at you for that is not hilarious.

1585
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,170
Have you read any criticisms of her 
know?

1586
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,053
So people that just go so far left,
they spun around and their noses up the 

1587
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,000
rights ass.
There's so confused.

1588
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:34,873
That's the one thing is we're the,
the left goes so far left and the right 

1589
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:39,650
and the rest goes so far as calls it 
out,

1590
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,513
you know,
it's like,

1591
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:44,510
it's like tHis black lives matter going 
after the women's march thing.

1592
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:47,750
Like everybody relax one hand though.
I got to Admit though,

1593
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:48,584
I read the thing and I was like,
why would they complain about people 

1594
01:10:50,901 --> 01:10:51,734
supporting this women's march?
Why would they complain about something 

1595
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,310
good?
And then the other part of me went,

1596
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,380
well,
imagine if you were them manage.

1597
01:10:57,381 --> 01:10:59,720
If you were them,
you're protesting against people getting

1598
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:00,554
shot and killed by cops and you're 
trying to make a movement out of that 

1599
01:11:04,641 --> 01:11:06,350
and you don't get near the kind of 
traction.

1600
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:07,423
Nowhere near the kind of positive press.
Then the other part of me goes back to 

1601
01:11:10,761 --> 01:11:11,594
the women's march and go,
you know what's crazy about the women's 

1602
01:11:12,711 --> 01:11:13,544
march?
Not a single fucking arrest all across 

1603
01:11:15,151 --> 01:11:17,150
the country.
That's good vibes,

1604
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,590
which has done pretty.
Were wearing pink hats with cat ears.

1605
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:24,510
They're called pussy hats.
Get it.

1606
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,970
So they have these fucking cats were 
wearing.

1607
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:31,080
our cops rather were wearing them and 
women were taking pictures because,

1608
01:11:31,081 --> 01:11:32,160
you know,
you sit there and you say,

1609
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:32,880
okay,
look,

1610
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,713
you know,
people can do this and we can do it 

1611
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:38,340
peacefully and we can it rationally and 
we're all at the end of the day.

1612
01:11:38,341 --> 01:11:41,810
We're all in the same boat,
but he was talking the street.

1613
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:42,953
Do you think there's enough people that 
aren't racist that you could pull 

1614
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:47,034
something like that off?
Do you think it's more common to be 

1615
01:11:49,381 --> 01:11:54,381
racist than it is to be sexist?
You know,

1616
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:59,030
I will say the universe does things a,
uh,

1617
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,490
for a reason I think.
And I had a,

1618
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,920
I have two amazing daughters and it 
changed my life and it changed the way I

1619
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:05,843
view the world and it changed the way I 
see things and it's why I look at that 

1620
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,010
march and I said,
that's a great thing.

1621
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:12,480
And uh,
you know,

1622
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:12,781
it,
it,

1623
01:12:12,781 --> 01:12:14,040
it,
it definitely,

1624
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:17,490
you know,
it alters how you think about things for

1625
01:12:17,491 --> 01:12:18,324
sure.
It also alters how you think about the 

1626
01:12:19,651 --> 01:12:21,390
future,
because a lot of people are like,

1627
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:22,343
fuck,
level orange is not going to fucking do 

1628
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:25,710
anything in mind.
When you have kids,

1629
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:27,180
all of a sudden you're like,
shit,

1630
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,313
I want my kid to go swimming.
You don't want a kid to go in a 

1631
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:32,710
nightmare.
The only one.

1632
01:12:32,711 --> 01:12:34,290
And I don't want to.
We're adults.

1633
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,193
You know,
we gotta we gotta pick up her own shit 

1634
01:12:36,361 --> 01:12:38,130
here.
In any case,

1635
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,680
I think it's a good idea.
I think,

1636
01:12:40,681 --> 01:12:41,620
uh,
we should,

1637
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:43,013
we will submit our,
a council of elders idea to the world 

1638
01:12:46,051 --> 01:12:49,320
via the internet and see if we get a 
billion votes,

1639
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:52,200
then I think everybody has to adopt it.
And then,

1640
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,034
uh,
and then we get to sort of be special 

1641
01:12:54,691 --> 01:12:55,524
advisors.

1642
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,650
I seriously think this could actually 
happen one day.

1643
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,180
It might not happen in our lives,
you know,

1644
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:03,480
who's a good politician that people like
and would fucking follow a good vibe.

1645
01:13:03,481 --> 01:13:04,890
Ron paul,
joe biden,

1646
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,470
uh,
maybe you know,

1647
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,313
joe biden.
We used to have joe biden night at 

1648
01:13:08,641 --> 01:13:09,474
stitches comedy club back in boston 
where we would plagiarize each other's 

1649
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:12,534
material because joe biden got busted 
speeches when he was running for 

1650
01:13:15,661 --> 01:13:18,060
president eight.
Really?

1651
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:22,230
Everybody's kinda forgot about that.
He seems like a fairly decent dude,

1652
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:24,300
although a little odd.
Yeah.

1653
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:26,400
You want,
you want a little bit odd.

1654
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,380
But you know what,
whenever vice president,

1655
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:29,031
you're like,
oh,

1656
01:13:29,031 --> 01:13:30,750
it has to do with fucking smile.
Like,

1657
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:31,793
you know,
they don't have to.

1658
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:32,441
They,
you know,

1659
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:35,130
nobody blamed for anything.
Volumes are mainly like,

1660
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,830
to me it's kind of a favorite one.
I think that made him.

1661
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:40,650
If the mems had come out before the 
election,

1662
01:13:40,651 --> 01:13:41,730
he could have won that with,
uh,

1663
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:42,613
the,
my favorite one was biden throwing his 

1664
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:46,170
head back,
laughing is that he goes,

1665
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:48,330
and then I said to hillary,
you did the same thing.

1666
01:13:48,331 --> 01:13:50,010
Monica did,
you blew it.

1667
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,890
And then then obama says,
you know,

1668
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:53,910
she kills people,
right?

1669
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,640
Yeah.
It's that picture,

1670
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:00,653
that picture.
And then they use that with a bunch of 

1671
01:14:01,951 --> 01:14:03,820
them.
I'm so glad.

1672
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,580
So fuck.
Oh my god.

1673
01:14:05,581 --> 01:14:08,430
Oh good.
All right.

1674
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,770
It's uh,
it's interesting.

1675
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:11,823
But I think that what I'm saying about 
technology is I think we're way more 

1676
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:16,384
connected as human beings than we ever 
have been before and I think a lot of 

1677
01:14:19,031 --> 01:14:19,864
this crazy super social justice warrior 
progressive shit that you're seeing 

1678
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:26,290
today where it's getting so far,
far,

1679
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:27,124
far outreaches of it are so out of hand.
I think all of this is possible and all 

1680
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:34,240
of this is because of this new found 
opportunity.

1681
01:14:34,241 --> 01:14:36,720
We have to communicate with each other 
that just previously just.

1682
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,920
I've got a question for you.
Okay.

1683
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:40,323
So you look at.
I agree with you like we have this 

1684
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:46,940
ability to connect all day everyday and 
it's going to be yours.

1685
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:50,540
It's going to get crazier and we are,
aren't connect more and more connected.

1686
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:52,960
Is this is just the beginning.
Have you seen this?

1687
01:14:52,961 --> 01:14:54,520
Augmented reality,
but yes.

1688
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:56,650
Yes.
Like you see that and you're like,

1689
01:14:56,651 --> 01:14:58,150
oh,
what we have now is,

1690
01:14:58,151 --> 01:15:00,550
I mean rudimentary and that's two years 
old,

1691
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:03,610
three years old.
And once people start submitting to some

1692
01:15:03,611 --> 01:15:06,750
sort of a lens in there,
I mean that's kinda goddamn happened.

1693
01:15:06,751 --> 01:15:08,460
People are already gettIng lenses in the
riser,

1694
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,960
repair their vision.
I have friends that have lenses.

1695
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,300
I have a above.
My friend steve,

1696
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:17,260
he just got two friends,
steve that had had had eye operations,

1697
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:19,900
but my friend steve just got to fucking 
artificial lens.

1698
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:23,800
It had a rip cornea and they put an 
artificial lens over a piece on it.

1699
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,140
Look insane.
Yeah,

1700
01:15:25,141 --> 01:15:27,370
I mean he's not even like a martial 
artist anything.

1701
01:15:27,371 --> 01:15:28,204
He's just a regular guy that an eye 
problem and they're starting to do this 

1702
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:32,230
on people and it's going to accelerate.

1703
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:34,420
They're doing all sorts of crazy shit 
now,

1704
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:37,270
but when you see augmented reality,
so augmented,

1705
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:38,800
I don't know if everybody knows what it 
is,

1706
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:42,070
but now,
right now it's glass is and once you get

1707
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:42,904
over the fact,
which is weird that it's like holograms 

1708
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:47,920
inside your eyeball.
Yeah,

1709
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:49,780
like they,
they put them in now.

1710
01:15:49,781 --> 01:15:53,440
I'm like,
I'm a fucking like germaphobe freaking.

1711
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:54,370
I'm like,
oh shit,

1712
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:56,170
that's going to give me cancer the 
fucking eyeball.

1713
01:15:56,171 --> 01:15:58,030
But apparently it's not.
But in any case,

1714
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,800
after you get over that fear,
you're like,

1715
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:01,910
oh,
you put these things on it,

1716
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:02,900
this room,
right?

1717
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:03,850
And you're like,
oh,

1718
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,830
there's a tv and you're watching tv in 
your room.

1719
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:06,813
Okay,
great.

1720
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:07,813
And they're like putting.
It's only a tv because your brain is 

1721
01:16:10,061 --> 01:16:13,270
used to it being a tv.
when you get used to it will just flip a

1722
01:16:13,271 --> 01:16:15,370
button and you're on the 50 yard line,
you know,

1723
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,630
it can be anything.

1724
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:17,600
It can be any size.
Yeah,

1725
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,360
you can do the art and the room,
you know,

1726
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,920
now that's for tv watching it.
It was developed for like a media thing,

1727
01:16:23,921 --> 01:16:26,020
like it could be movies or tv,
but they're like,

1728
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:27,250
oh,
be your phone.

1729
01:16:27,251 --> 01:16:29,140
It can be your computer,
it can be everything.

1730
01:16:29,141 --> 01:16:31,270
So everything is going to be in your 
glasses,

1731
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,830
a camera,
everything.

1732
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,580
You control it with this little thing 
and it's you.

1733
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,530
You're going to be,
you know,

1734
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:38,291
your,
all,

1735
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:40,480
your media is there,
your phone is there,

1736
01:16:40,481 --> 01:16:41,800
your computers there,
everything's there.

1737
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:43,990
and it's just this connectivity that's 
always there.

1738
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:46,150
It's always on.
It's fucking crazy.

1739
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:49,480
Now there's all kinds of ethical things.
And how's that going to change humanity,

1740
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:51,310
all that stuff,
but who cares is going to happen because

1741
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:53,830
the technology's there and fucking 
better than a phone.

1742
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,593
Now once that connectivity happens,
to go back to your point is there's a 

1743
01:17:00,341 --> 01:17:03,250
power in there for positivity and all 
this stuff.

1744
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:05,230
But if you look at,
for example,

1745
01:17:05,231 --> 01:17:07,110
social media,
you know,

1746
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:12,050
one of the things that is destroying 
twitter is they can't keep like the,

1747
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:12,951
and,
and by the way,

1748
01:17:12,951 --> 01:17:14,750
the fake news on facebook and all this 
stuff,

1749
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:18,620
they can't police it is to mom people is
too many people,

1750
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:20,570
too much shit.
And it's like bad people.

1751
01:17:20,571 --> 01:17:22,670
It's just people to.
And everybody's got an opinion.

1752
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:25,280
And by the way,
when you're across the table,

1753
01:17:25,281 --> 01:17:27,070
the reason why we eat,
the reason why we have feast,

1754
01:17:27,071 --> 01:17:29,360
the reason why we do all this shit just 
because when you're eating together,

1755
01:17:29,361 --> 01:17:31,370
you form social bonds and all this shit 
and you're like,

1756
01:17:31,371 --> 01:17:32,950
oh,
I'm not going to kill you because we had

1757
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:33,830
a beer together,
whatever.

1758
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:37,700
But when you don't.
And it's just this anonymous,

1759
01:17:37,701 --> 01:17:39,560
I can say and do whatever the fuck I 
want.

1760
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:44,150
It just becomes like crazy and it 
becomes fun for people there.

1761
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,433
Bob,
fIfty five to two a asshole and then 

1762
01:17:47,721 --> 01:17:49,470
they decided to fuck with,
you know,

1763
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,170
if it's fun for them,
it's a little game,

1764
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:52,160
you know,
it was,

1765
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,310
I was listening to this radio lab pot.
No,

1766
01:17:55,311 --> 01:17:56,720
it was an article I was reading.
That's what it was.

1767
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:01,900
And it was about this,
a guy who had been stalked online by his

1768
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:06,620
friend's son and uh,
they were,

1769
01:18:06,621 --> 01:18:07,454
I mean,
it got to the point where this guy was 

1770
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:10,950
just,
they were doing all,

1771
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:11,863
he was doing all sorts of horrible shit 
and sending them a horrible evil 

1772
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:16,370
messages.
They were terrified.

1773
01:18:16,371 --> 01:18:17,204
They were all having horrible anxiety.
And it turned out that it was his 

1774
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:22,940
friend's son and he called the fbi,
found for fun.

1775
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:24,643
He didn't think about what he broke down
crying when they confronted him and it 

1776
01:18:26,991 --> 01:18:27,890
was,
it was awful.

1777
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:28,970
But it was like,
wow,

1778
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:29,804
there's lIke some sort of weird,
perverse thing that people enjoy doing 

1779
01:18:33,591 --> 01:18:35,600
just fucking with someone as a game.

1780
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:39,070
And that all takes place because of that
lack of social interaction.

1781
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,020
The problem with that is,
is as those tools,

1782
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:47,021
let's say augmented reality get more and
more powerful than that sort of,

1783
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:50,510
unless it's.
Unless we look at that aspect of it,

1784
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,160
we're all fucked.
Maybe,

1785
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:53,053
maybe not though you know it's going to 
be you and I are going to be able to 

1786
01:18:55,491 --> 01:18:59,150
have this conversation where we're 
nowhere near each other exactly the same

1787
01:18:59,151 --> 01:18:59,984
way that we're having it written.
Now we're going to be able to look at 

1788
01:19:01,641 --> 01:19:04,700
each other in the eye and have like this
kind of a conversation and you are going

1789
01:19:04,701 --> 01:19:05,940
to represent you,
you.

1790
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:06,793
There's going to be some sort of A video
version of you that I will not be able 

1791
01:19:09,021 --> 01:19:09,854
to distinguish from you and you'll be 
sItting there right now and it won't be 

1792
01:19:12,021 --> 01:19:13,910
much different other than physical 
contact.

1793
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:14,773
There's an interesting point though,
which is when humans are hungry and 

1794
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:23,420
thirsty,
our immediate reaction is no,

1795
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:27,200
and when we're fed and when we're a bit 
boozed up,

1796
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,093
the reaction is yes,
which is why everyone says let's have a 

1797
01:19:30,081 --> 01:19:31,810
business lunch or a business dinner.
Right?

1798
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:35,600
And also if you look at how we socialize
with the family,

1799
01:19:35,601 --> 01:19:36,434
how we socialize with each other,
if you actually look back at your 

1800
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,561
history and say,
oh,

1801
01:19:39,561 --> 01:19:41,930
I'm that guy buddy or my family,
whatever.

1802
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:45,710
If you look back at the majority of the 
positive memories that you have,

1803
01:19:45,711 --> 01:19:46,544
they're generally at thanksgiving with 
the family or christmas with this or we 

1804
01:19:49,641 --> 01:19:50,474
got drunk with this guy or we at burgers
late at night or whatever it is because 

1805
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:55,910
that's,
you get these sort of endorphin rushes.

1806
01:19:55,911 --> 01:19:56,481
And I,
oh,

1807
01:19:56,481 --> 01:20:00,080
we're bonding.
So I think once you take that out,

1808
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:00,980
and I.

1809
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:04,430
It's interesting because I was taught 
someone the other day,

1810
01:20:04,431 --> 01:20:08,760
I was saying the more gets 
sophisticated,

1811
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:14,430
the more you kind of have to fly because
it's to have that meeting.

1812
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:16,520
Like we have the night and call,
you know,

1813
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:19,840
but now you have to fly and you have to 
have the meal and you have to have to.

1814
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:23,940
Because if you're doing a big deal with 
somebody and you don't do that,

1815
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,220
even though it doesn't make any sense at
all,

1816
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:29,490
it's become a thing.
Everyone's flying way more.

1817
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:33,380
But ironically,
because of the technology is seen as non

1818
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,120
effect,

1819
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,480
so there's that in the world of 
business.

1820
01:20:35,481 --> 01:20:36,740
yeah,
no kidding.

1821
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:38,780
Wow.
I didn't see that coming,

1822
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,470
but it totally makes sense.
Yeah,

1823
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,113
it completely makes sense.
I feel much different about people when 

1824
01:20:43,701 --> 01:20:44,534
I meet them.
Yeah.

1825
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,411
You know,
and,

1826
01:20:45,411 --> 01:20:46,244
and not meeting him even for awhile.
Even being in communication for a long 

1827
01:20:49,191 --> 01:20:51,860
time without meeting them,
they sort of disassociate.

1828
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,690
It doesn't feel the same.
Correct.

1829
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,310
Yeah,
it makes sense.

1830
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:56,950
Totally does.
Because we,

1831
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:57,883
that's how we interacted forever.
I wonder if that same feeling will 

1832
01:21:00,621 --> 01:21:03,620
happen when you're dealing with someone 
in a three d form,

1833
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,960
like a hologram that's 
indistinguishable.

1834
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:08,360
Interesting.
And it's coming rapidly.

1835
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,400
Yeah.
I mean the technology is here now,

1836
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:11,653
it's just how quick can they make it 
into like a thing that everybody can 

1837
01:21:14,421 --> 01:21:15,051
buy.
Yeah.

1838
01:21:15,051 --> 01:21:18,530
How quick can they and what would,
what form will it take?

1839
01:21:18,531 --> 01:21:21,080
Because we're just extrapolating from 
what they have right now.

1840
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:24,110
Who knows what form it's going to be 
available.

1841
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:24,973
Google already has their contact lens 
thing and nobody thought this whole 

1842
01:21:27,651 --> 01:21:29,270
thing was going to happen in the first 
place.

1843
01:21:29,271 --> 01:21:32,450
This augmented reality,
this wasn't something discussed 20 years

1844
01:21:32,451 --> 01:21:34,160
ago,
it was always virtual reality.

1845
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:35,540
It wasn't,
yeah,

1846
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:37,550
it wasn't reality and it might just 
skip,

1847
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,093
might just go to augmented,
it could go to something even crazier 

1848
01:21:41,241 --> 01:21:43,730
than that.
It can go to some sort of a,

1849
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:47,570
some sort of a recreation of life that 
is,

1850
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:50,410
is imparted into your brain.
Yeah.

1851
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:56,170
Literally a hologram that's an 
individualized hologram on the inside of

1852
01:21:56,171 --> 01:21:57,004
your eye.

1853
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:57,863
Yeah.
It's like projecting on your eyelid or 

1854
01:21:59,911 --> 01:22:01,140
on your eyeball.
Yeah,

1855
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,280
but what I'm thinking is something even 
crazier now when you close your eyes and

1856
01:22:05,281 --> 01:22:06,840
you're transported,
you know,

1857
01:22:06,841 --> 01:22:08,160
like what was that movie with arnold 
work?

1858
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:09,053
Total recall style because he just shot 
into this new place that seems to me to 

1859
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:16,320
not be far off.
I just see.

1860
01:22:16,321 --> 01:22:21,210
I see where they're going as far as 
their ability to send signals from brain

1861
01:22:21,211 --> 01:22:22,620
to brain through an annoyance.

1862
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:23,573
You know,
what is being worked on and 

1863
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:30,710
theoretically possiBle what they.
So interstellar space.

1864
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:36,981
Travel is hard and impossible because 
people will die before they get to where

1865
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:39,060
they're supposed to be going and all 
this stuff.

1866
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,680
So theoretically what we can do is we 
can,

1867
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:44,973
you know,
have clones in other places and you 

1868
01:22:49,201 --> 01:22:53,190
download your,
your brain into a,

1869
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:54,293
like a computer,
you send that brain to another computer 

1870
01:22:59,311 --> 01:23:01,470
through laser beam traveling at the 
speed of light,

1871
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,950
and then it gets downloaded into the 
clothing on the other side of the thing.

1872
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,630
Now that's obviously highly theoretical.
What's going to happen?

1873
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,570
You're going to have a whole country 
filled with Donald Trump,

1874
01:23:10,571 --> 01:23:12,010
like 1 billion.
Trump's,

1875
01:23:12,011 --> 01:23:15,280
he's just gonna fucking keep recreating 
themselves over and over and over again.

1876
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:16,743
And you're going to be.
People are going to make more than one 

1877
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:20,590
version of themselves going to be walls 
everywhere.

1878
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:22,090
That's going to be a real problem.
You come home,

1879
01:23:22,091 --> 01:23:24,370
there's 15 of you in your house,
you know,

1880
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:27,310
and they all want to watch the game and 
scream the same things.

1881
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:28,760
And then you're competing to see who 
says,

1882
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:30,183
this is another interesting thing.
This is another interesting thing 

1883
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:32,974
because technology,
when we go back to sanity versus 

1884
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:37,780
insanity.
So for example,

1885
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,950
right now we have crispr technology 
where you can edit the genome,

1886
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:42,870
right?
Right.

1887
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:45,220
And go in and log.
So you can go in and say,

1888
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:46,054
well I don't want to edit out the cancer
thing and like when you were going to 

1889
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:51,370
have a kid and then you can say,
well hey,

1890
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,350
they're not going to have downs.
You're like,

1891
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:54,520
fuck yeah,
that sounds good,

1892
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:58,660
but you know,
putting cancer and make n six,

1893
01:23:58,661 --> 01:24:00,730
four and you know this and that,
the other thing put out,

1894
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:01,540
take out the.

1895
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,373
Right.
Right.

1896
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:04,960
And so because of that,
we said,

1897
01:24:04,961 --> 01:24:05,794
okay,
well we're not gonna what I'm gonna do 

1898
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:09,430
that because we're playing god know 
stuff.

1899
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:12,830
But they have places in China already 
where they're,

1900
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,943
where they're going to do that.
Now if you extrapolate because they're 

1901
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:20,980
already experimenting on human fetus.
But if you extrapolate and you say,

1902
01:24:20,981 --> 01:24:21,814
okay,
they start doing this and everybody 

1903
01:24:23,861 --> 01:24:28,861
comes out genius plus iq and seven feet 
tall and super strong and whatever.

1904
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:31,480
It's kind of an arms race.
Yes.

1905
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:32,800
And you're going to say,
whoa,

1906
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:37,150
gatica be damned like we were going to 
have to compete.

1907
01:24:37,151 --> 01:24:39,370
And,
and that's when you don't see like,

1908
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,233
oh,
this technology where like when your 

1909
01:24:40,841 --> 01:24:41,674
logical said,
well we can't mess with this because 

1910
01:24:43,241 --> 01:24:44,650
it's funny because they,
they,

1911
01:24:44,670 --> 01:24:46,330
they do things like,
oh,

1912
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:48,100
they were checking in on how 
butterflies,

1913
01:24:48,101 --> 01:24:48,934
he called her and they used crispr to 
change like one thing and then all of a 

1914
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:52,984
sudden the butterfly,
a monarch butterfly just became all 

1915
01:24:54,701 --> 01:24:56,060
white and like their,
you know,

1916
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:59,170
things shrunk when her kids were like,
you're playing god and you're like,

1917
01:24:59,171 --> 01:25:01,750
one thing makes all this other shit 
happened.

1918
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:04,270
And so,
but that's happening now.

1919
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:06,910
That's happening today.
They're actually doing it.

1920
01:25:06,911 --> 01:25:07,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

1921
01:25:07,991 --> 01:25:09,310
And what if they deal with wooly 
mammoths?

1922
01:25:09,311 --> 01:25:09,881
TheY say,
you know what?

1923
01:25:09,881 --> 01:25:13,140
We could whack this all the way up to 
$100 super mammoth.

1924
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,970
And they started making superman mous 
with three decks.

1925
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:20,030
It's going to be real strange 100 years.
Really.

1926
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:21,340
We're not going to be able to say,
well,

1927
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,570
you and I are probably less science can.
I don't even know that the live.

1928
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:26,380
Well,
that's the other thing is they're saying

1929
01:25:26,381 --> 01:25:27,214
now with advances in medicine that the 
kids being born today are going to live 

1930
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,260
into their hundreds.
Yeah,

1931
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,030
I've heard that they're going to live to
be 150 years old.

1932
01:25:35,031 --> 01:25:38,680
That's going to be really common,
but the thing is that's just saying that

1933
01:25:38,681 --> 01:25:42,220
today they might come up with something 
five years from now that makes people go

1934
01:25:42,221 --> 01:25:45,460
back like reverse aging.
That's entirely possible.

1935
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,900
I mean,
it's just a process.

1936
01:25:46,901 --> 01:25:47,734
It's a biological process.
If you can stay alive long Enough for 

1937
01:25:51,011 --> 01:25:53,950
them to figure that out,
how to turn it back and you know,

1938
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:56,710
that's the real playing god,
turn you back,

1939
01:25:56,740 --> 01:26:00,000
go back to when you were younger and 
then you're going to have to.

1940
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:03,710
You're going to be a younger.
You dealing with a new super race that's

1941
01:26:03,711 --> 01:26:04,544
been developed

1942
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:09,530
where everyone is 300 pounds of solid 
muscle and every olympic wrestler.

1943
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:10,423
Yeah.
Every olympic wrestling match between 

1944
01:26:12,591 --> 01:26:13,424
two enormous gorillas.
There's no more fighting ai sort of war 

1945
01:26:18,411 --> 01:26:21,800
against the terminator bots.
It's going to be incredibly strange.

1946
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:23,690
What is that?
Aging is reversible,

1947
01:26:23,691 --> 01:26:28,430
at least in human cells and live mice.
Changes to gene activity that occur with

1948
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:31,700
age can be turned back.
A new study shows jesus christ.

1949
01:26:31,701 --> 01:26:34,190
Longevity can be turned back.
I'll tell you what's going to happen.

1950
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:36,890
Old ladies going to be out getting dick 
like crazy.

1951
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:39,830
That's going to be happening.
They're going to,

1952
01:26:39,831 --> 01:26:42,590
they're going to turn 20 and then 
they're going to be on a rampage.

1953
01:26:42,591 --> 01:26:44,870
They're going to just hit the clubs and 
fuck everybody.

1954
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:46,190
Well,
I got to tell you,

1955
01:26:46,191 --> 01:26:47,024
you know this,
that your evolutionary clock stops at 

1956
01:26:49,341 --> 01:26:51,530
40.
Like it just at 40.

1957
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:53,990
You don't,
you don't continue on to,

1958
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:54,853
oh,
we're going to try this and we're going 

1959
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:56,060
to ourselves.

1960
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:58,520
We'll keep on making new shit.
It just stops.

1961
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,640
And if you could,
if you could go in and said,

1962
01:27:01,641 --> 01:27:03,970
I'm going to go to the clinic and keep 
my envelope.

1963
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,270
EvolutionAry clock ticking.
What'd you do it?

1964
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:08,390
Well,
anything that made me feel better.

1965
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:09,770
Yeah,
that's how I feel.

1966
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:10,431
I mean,
you know,

1967
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:11,264
people said,
well that's really selfish and you'll 

1968
01:27:11,991 --> 01:27:14,180
stay around forever and use up all the 
resources.

1969
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:17,090
Uh,
that's not up to you bitch in here.

1970
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:20,900
Here's the other problem with that.
Like when throw 500 years ago,

1971
01:27:20,901 --> 01:27:22,310
everybody died at 20,
you know,

1972
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:26,930
nobody fucking lived to be today.
Like being 49 was impossible back then.

1973
01:27:26,931 --> 01:27:28,610
It was incredibly tiny,
tiny,

1974
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:31,880
tiny people that didn't eat that much.
So yeah,

1975
01:27:31,881 --> 01:27:32,750
I would do it.
Yeah,

1976
01:27:32,751 --> 01:27:34,970
I would do it selfishly or would I do 
it?

1977
01:27:34,971 --> 01:27:38,390
I would do it just because it would be a
better experience.

1978
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:39,523
Like if they all of a sudden gave you 
something and you felt your immune 

1979
01:27:42,021 --> 01:27:43,400
system work better,
your,

1980
01:27:43,401 --> 01:27:43,980
your,
you know,

1981
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:47,390
your body fat was lower,
you had more vitality,

1982
01:27:47,391 --> 01:27:50,480
you've got more things done,
you more energetic and you don't have to

1983
01:27:50,481 --> 01:27:54,080
lose any experience.
You don't have to loSe any understanding

1984
01:27:54,081 --> 01:27:56,210
of the world.
You don't lose your facultIes.

1985
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:57,320
Yeah.
Why wouldn't I do it?

1986
01:27:57,321 --> 01:28:00,530
So that's the famous to students.
The thing with technology is that,

1987
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:03,350
is that there's going to,
they're going to try to hold it back,

1988
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:06,380
but it's just going to get.
They're going to get it back.

1989
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:08,680
I don't think they can hold it back.
Yeah.

1990
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:11,540
Well,
I think the China factor is huge because

1991
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:12,374
I think if China really does start doing
that with crispr and make these super 

1992
01:28:15,201 --> 01:28:16,034
athletes and superhumans and make people
that are just infinitely smarter than 

1993
01:28:18,921 --> 01:28:19,754
what we have today,
that that also plays into my idea of 

1994
01:28:23,361 --> 01:28:24,194
technology induced evolution.
I think symbiotically introduced where 

1995
01:28:28,611 --> 01:28:31,220
it's like human beings interacting with 
technology,

1996
01:28:31,221 --> 01:28:35,090
but I think also that technology being 
applied to our biological being,

1997
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:38,300
all that stuff is going to happen.
Did you ever read neuromancer?

1998
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:40,430
Oh god,
why did I,

1999
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,220
why does that was a while.
Basically he,

2000
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,280
he,
he's was that love prophesied?

2001
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,720
No,
it's a lookup neuromancer.

2002
01:28:48,730 --> 01:28:51,470
It's a canadian guy,
but he's,

2003
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,500
he's a William Gibson gibson.
There you go.

2004
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:56,030
Eighty four,
84.

2005
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:56,970
Wow.
Um,

2006
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,680
but basically he,
he,

2007
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,533
he,
he sort of foresaw all of stuff 

2008
01:29:01,471 --> 01:29:02,304
happening

2009
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,930
and sort of,
by the way,

2010
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:05,003
it's interesting because he gets 
credited with a lot of the tech stuff 

2011
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:13,010
because a lot of people who were in 
college read em and then use those Ideas

2012
01:29:13,111 --> 01:29:14,910
to invent the things that are coming out
now.

2013
01:29:14,911 --> 01:29:15,990
That's cool.
Yeah.

2014
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:17,460
That's amazing.
What a science.

2015
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:20,340
I wonder what drugs he took.
Probably good ones,

2016
01:29:20,341 --> 01:29:21,930
huh?
But if you've ever read it,

2017
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:23,040
you're like,
holy shit.

2018
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,231
Like he,
he,

2019
01:29:24,231 --> 01:29:26,160
he called it all.
I feel like I read it,

2020
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:28,260
but I think I read it like right out of 
high school.

2021
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,200
yeah,
it's been so long distant ones,

2022
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:36,510
but I love the fact that these people 
who are creative people you know,

2023
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,820
are the ones that have come up with a 
lot of these ideas.

2024
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,073
There was a thing of reading she wells 
and all the different things that hg 

2025
01:29:42,661 --> 01:29:46,140
wells predicted and the people will say,
actually that's not so crazy,

2026
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:48,060
but well that's how things get started.

2027
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:49,620
It's just they can't do it,
you know,

2028
01:29:49,621 --> 01:29:50,454
like,
well all the shit we're talking about 

2029
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:51,950
now,
you know,

2030
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:52,783
you just,
you and I talking about potential 

2031
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:55,223
technologies,
those thoughts like between people at 

2032
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:00,960
uni that are not technologically savvy 
at all.

2033
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:06,150
Those thoughts can get into the mind of 
someone who is and then they can project

2034
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,550
that idea in their own way and start 
working on it.

2035
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:12,540
Those are going to be a huge revolution,
and then they'll say,

2036
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:14,670
joe and jane,
the council of elders,

2037
01:30:14,671 --> 01:30:17,940
we made it to imagine if it all boils 
down,

2038
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:20,850
civilization in the future,
after the mad max days,

2039
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:22,590
and it'll pull us down to this 
conversation.

2040
01:30:22,591 --> 01:30:25,370
We'll try and wild stallions.
How's that?

2041
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:26,453
How's it like the.
Whilst I agree with you was thinking 

2042
01:30:27,571 --> 01:30:28,404
about it.
It's a bill and ted's excellent 

2043
01:30:29,251 --> 01:30:30,380
adventure.
Jesus.

2044
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:31,980
They saved the world.

2045
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:38,190
Bill and ted's excellent adventure.
Yeah.

2046
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:40,950
Um,
do we have enough people?

2047
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:43,260
We didn't.
We only picked one woman.

2048
01:30:43,261 --> 01:30:45,090
We need more than women.
Who else?

2049
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:47,100
I like Martha Stewart.
I enjoy her on that.

2050
01:30:47,101 --> 01:30:50,300
Snoop dogg show.
She's a hell of a woman she had.

2051
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:52,530
She also doesn't give a shit.
Put her in coach.

2052
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:53,993
Yeah,
she's good.

2053
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:55,890
She's good.
She doesn't give a shit.

2054
01:30:55,891 --> 01:30:56,724
I like people don't give a shit.
People just through the fucking papers 

2055
01:30:58,411 --> 01:30:59,244
over there.
That's it.

2056
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:02,040
He just fucking elected Martha Stewart.
This guy's an asshole.

2057
01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:04,170
I'm not listening to this podcast 
anymore.

2058
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,390
I liked Martha Stewart because she's 
been to jail.

2059
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:08,460
Yes,
she's fucking down.

2060
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:10,650
I always say like it held her mud.
If you,

2061
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:14,520
if you,
if you've done shit and seeing things,

2062
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:19,500
then you're much better a ruler than 
somebody who's never done anything.

2063
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:21,750
I like her.
Yeah.

2064
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,120
So by that,
by that logic,

2065
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:24,983
who else?

2066
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:28,710
Who else has done shit and seen things 
that you'd like to throw in the mix?

2067
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:32,510
Hmm.
I mean,

2068
01:31:32,511 --> 01:31:35,160
it's hard because you're searching.
Your database is for.

2069
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:40,190
There's a lot of different people out 
there who are sort of admirable.

2070
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:44,340
Again,
I mean there was a lock.

2071
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,560
Yeah,
we'd have to really.

2072
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:48,143
We'd have to really sit down if someone 
was going to really formulate something 

2073
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:52,740
along those lines,
you'd have to really think it through.

2074
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:56,160
Yeah.
But not impossible and,

2075
01:31:56,161 --> 01:31:58,920
and a better solution than this fucking 
mess.

2076
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:01,450
Presidential masses.
Ridiculous.

2077
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:06,550
You know,
and it's also is gonna sound fucked up,

2078
01:32:06,551 --> 01:32:10,210
but I don't think everybody should be 
allowed to vote.

2079
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:12,123
I think you should have to prove in some
way that you have an understanding of 

2080
01:32:15,641 --> 01:32:17,890
what you're saying in order to be able 
to vote.

2081
01:32:17,891 --> 01:32:18,724
The problem with that of course is who 
the hell gets to decide that that's the 

2082
01:32:20,651 --> 01:32:21,370
problem.

2083
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:24,460
But if you have someone who's mentally 
deranged and they just haven't committed

2084
01:32:24,461 --> 01:32:25,294
a crime yet and you,
you read what they have to say about 

2085
01:32:27,701 --> 01:32:30,190
lIfe and about people and they're racist
and sexist,

2086
01:32:30,230 --> 01:32:31,960
but he's lIke,
here's the problem with that.

2087
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:32,581
Right?
And,

2088
01:32:32,581 --> 01:32:37,210
and I agree with you,
but it's also problematic because here's

2089
01:32:37,211 --> 01:32:39,460
the problem that's happening.
It's happening all over the world,

2090
01:32:39,461 --> 01:32:40,294
but let's say In America,
because everybody's up in arms about 

2091
01:32:43,481 --> 01:32:47,380
trump and there's protests and all this 
stuff and all the media is going,

2092
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,273
can you fucking believe this guy?
and you only realize that that's what 

2093
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:55,420
the rest of the country was saying.
Every time obama opened his mouth.

2094
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:58,780
And so you sit there and say,
hold on a second here.

2095
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,540
Half the country believes that,
you know,

2096
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:05,170
people crazy.
People in California and New York voted.

2097
01:33:05,171 --> 01:33:09,460
And then now I in Texas and Oklahoma 
have to fucking suffer on the other.

2098
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:10,960
Half of the people were saying,
hold on a second.

2099
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:15,961
These people in Oklahoma and Texas and 
Ohio voted and now I have to fucking,

2100
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:18,220
you know,
listen to all this shit.

2101
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:22,780
And so that therein lies the rub.
Because to go back to it,

2102
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:23,680
you say,
okay,

2103
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:24,903
if he hear me out,
if you had your security and economic 

2104
01:33:28,931 --> 01:33:30,870
security,
uh,

2105
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,153
like solidified was there,
wouldn't it be more democratic to just 

2106
01:33:38,111 --> 01:33:38,944
say,
okay,

2107
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,100
Texas is Texas and California.
That's what it used to be.

2108
01:33:42,101 --> 01:33:42,934
Anyways.
The United States was the states rights 

2109
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:46,960
and all this stuff because the minute 
that happened to California,

2110
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:47,794
it's like,
fuck it.

2111
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,780
That just split off.
We want our pot.

2112
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:51,070
You know what I mean?
Well,

2113
01:33:51,071 --> 01:33:54,940
it would be interesting because you were
talking about with other countries,

2114
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:55,803
having smaller,
more manageable groups is more 

2115
01:33:57,251 --> 01:33:59,560
democratic democratic.
It's not a democratic,

2116
01:33:59,561 --> 01:34:02,740
not a bad idea in the current state that
we exist in.

2117
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,190
Not a bad idea to run things.
If it's dysfunctional,

2118
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,630
in fact,
it's worse than dysfunctional.

2119
01:34:07,631 --> 01:34:09,370
You're just going back to undo what they
just did.

2120
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:11,050
Why wouldn't you just say,
fuck it.

2121
01:34:11,051 --> 01:34:13,990
California is going to go off and do our
own thing in Texas.

2122
01:34:13,991 --> 01:34:16,030
Going to do its thing in Oklahoma is 
going to do its thing.

2123
01:34:16,031 --> 01:34:18,670
And by the way,
if you don't like it in Oklahoma,

2124
01:34:18,671 --> 01:34:21,430
you can move to California.
And how about less reliance,

2125
01:34:21,431 --> 01:34:22,360
much,
much,

2126
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:23,194
much,
much less reliance on a federal 

2127
01:34:24,521 --> 01:34:26,560
government because it's not necessarily.
It doesn't work.

2128
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:27,970
Yeah.
And it doesn't work,

2129
01:34:27,971 --> 01:34:28,804
but state government does.
So it works better because it's smaller 

2130
01:34:31,281 --> 01:34:32,950
and more and more democratic.
Yeah.

2131
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:36,400
I mean it's sort of tribes,
as long as we can keep from going to war

2132
01:34:36,401 --> 01:34:37,780
with each other,
you know,

2133
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:38,763
but that's what you have to do.
If you guarantee that economic security 

2134
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:42,393
and you guarantee that,
that sort of political and military and 

2135
01:34:45,061 --> 01:34:45,894
security,
then it kind of makes a ton of sense to 

2136
01:34:48,101 --> 01:34:49,180
just say,
well,

2137
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:52,390
if we're like minded people in New York 
or la or like,

2138
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:53,770
okay,
California,

2139
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:54,760
what's the stat?

2140
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:58,100
It's like California would be the eighth
economy in the world.

2141
01:34:58,101 --> 01:34:58,980
Six,
six,

2142
01:34:59,020 --> 01:34:59,853
six largest economy in the world.
Believe that paul shows a third of 

2143
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:03,323
california's favor,
a cal exit from the us and awakened 

2144
01:35:06,290 --> 01:35:07,123
trump's election victory.
And they were just fucking shitting on 

2145
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:12,080
Texas by the way,
years ago for this.

2146
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:14,690
Either way I favor it because I live 
here.

2147
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:18,230
It's god's country,
but all the tech people here smart,

2148
01:35:18,590 --> 01:35:20,840
all the food is here right?
Right.

2149
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:23,720
All the money's here.
It's one of the biggest here.

2150
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:27,700
Kanye west is here and have all of the 
kardashians and fact,

2151
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:30,500
and you can sit here and say it's more 
democratic.

2152
01:35:30,530 --> 01:35:33,590
We can have our.
We'd have cbd.

2153
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:34,850
Fuck it.
Let's just.

2154
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:35,713
Let's.
Let's do the experiments to Italy and 

2155
01:35:37,671 --> 01:35:40,610
France can live close to each other.
Why can't California,

2156
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:42,710
Nevada be different countries?
Right?

2157
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,120
It's basically the same thing.

2158
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:46,850
Fucking same thing.
Goddammit.

2159
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:49,100
We'd like to start today.
The California.

2160
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,900
I guess it's already started.
It's already started.

2161
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:54,920
We didn't even have to do.
We'll run though me and you will run.

2162
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,480
What do you want to ticket?
What do you want to be?

2163
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:59,150
A lot of California.
I'll be vice president.

2164
01:35:59,151 --> 01:36:00,680
You can be credit going to be fucking 
president.

2165
01:36:00,681 --> 01:36:01,514
Every president,
I'll be like,

2166
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,210
oh,
we biden.

2167
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:04,370
I don't even want to be a vice 
president.

2168
01:36:04,650 --> 01:36:09,620
I'll have a sort of legacy.
Will be on the council of elders.

2169
01:36:09,621 --> 01:36:10,454
We're going to have.
I think california's the only one cook 

2170
01:36:13,141 --> 01:36:14,610
enough to actually say,
fuck it.

2171
01:36:14,611 --> 01:36:17,090
We're going to leave my.
Let me tell you something.

2172
01:36:17,091 --> 01:36:21,590
We might win in this new era.
In this new era where you can't,

2173
01:36:21,591 --> 01:36:23,090
you can't be president,
you're canadian,

2174
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,360
you're american.
Now we have to change the laws,

2175
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:27,910
but if you're going to have to battle 
our.

2176
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:28,753
No,
but it's immediately going to 

2177
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:31,070
California,
California.

2178
01:36:31,071 --> 01:36:31,841
We'll,
we'll,

2179
01:36:31,841 --> 01:36:35,650
we'll allow it.
We'll wait as a couple.

2180
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:37,700
You can be governor of California.
Obviously arnold.

2181
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:41,240
I could be governor and then switch it 
over or.

2182
01:36:41,241 --> 01:36:41,931
Yeah.
Well,

2183
01:36:41,931 --> 01:36:43,700
when it becomes a country,
then we say,

2184
01:36:43,701 --> 01:36:45,710
well fuck all this being born here.
It's stupid.

2185
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:47,270
You have nothing to do with where you're
born.

2186
01:36:47,271 --> 01:36:50,930
Doesn't have anything to do with it.
You didn't ask to be born in Canada.

2187
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:53,270
If you did,
if you could take it back.

2188
01:36:53,271 --> 01:36:57,110
Would you be born here in god's country?
If you could take it back,

2189
01:36:57,170 --> 01:36:58,670
if you could denounce your canadian 
birth?

2190
01:36:58,671 --> 01:36:59,504
No.
I'll tell you why I show you my first 

2191
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:02,720
want you to.
Because.

2192
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:03,823
Because I think the.
I think the american experience 

2193
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:10,910
ironically is an immigrant experience.
I am literally the american dream.

2194
01:37:10,911 --> 01:37:13,370
You are.
I came here as an american to me.

2195
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:17,120
I came here as an immigrant.
I killed it.

2196
01:37:17,121 --> 01:37:18,470
I love it.
I love it here.

2197
01:37:18,471 --> 01:37:20,180
I love California.
I'm like stroking.

2198
01:37:20,181 --> 01:37:22,810
Awesome.
I say it to everybody and everyone shits

2199
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:23,181
on me.
I'm like,

2200
01:37:23,181 --> 01:37:24,014
fuck you.
And,

2201
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:25,270
and,
and uh,

2202
01:37:25,370 --> 01:37:27,020
but look,
growing up in Canada,

2203
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,790
I'm going to say it.
Great country,

2204
01:37:28,791 --> 01:37:30,860
clean,
great schools,

2205
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:32,960
nicer.
Nice people are really nice.

2206
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:34,280
Great.
So I look,

2207
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:37,760
but what I believe 20 percent less 
douche bags probably,

2208
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:38,653
I think,
but I believe that it doesn't fucking 

2209
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:42,410
matter where you're born,
like,

2210
01:37:42,411 --> 01:37:43,040
good,
cool.

2211
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:43,880
Like,
you know what,

2212
01:37:43,881 --> 01:37:45,990
if you're good and you're smart and 
whatever you,

2213
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,020
you rise to the top.
You're hard working.

2214
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:49,423
You know,
this was a country built by immigrants 

2215
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:52,820
and then all of a sudden they're saying,
well,

2216
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:54,650
they were the good ones.
Now there's bad ones.

2217
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:56,250
Yeah.
And even better because

2218
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:58,290
you were born in Canada,
you can't be president,

2219
01:37:58,291 --> 01:38:01,590
which is a shit job in the first place.
So it makes you the ultimate american.

2220
01:38:02,410 --> 01:38:03,740
Hey,
I'd love to be president,

2221
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:05,280
fix this mess,
but I can't do it.

2222
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:07,920
Can't do it.
I was born in the wrong piece of dirt.

2223
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:08,963
I can't do it.
You literally could fucking drive in a 

2224
01:38:11,281 --> 01:38:14,700
couple of hours from where you were into
America.

2225
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:15,321
Yeah,
I mean,

2226
01:38:15,321 --> 01:38:16,154
it's ridiculous.
I mean it's like I am connected to 

2227
01:38:19,681 --> 01:38:22,380
Delaware in some way.
We're both in the same country.

2228
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:23,790
Well,
you were,

2229
01:38:23,791 --> 01:38:24,624
you were.
Living in Canada is way fucking closer 

2230
01:38:27,181 --> 01:38:29,460
to the United States than me to 
Delaware.

2231
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:32,150
It's all the same shit.
It's all the same land mass.

2232
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:33,330
And they go,
god damn it.

2233
01:38:33,331 --> 01:38:34,570
We're stupid.
Yes,

2234
01:38:34,890 --> 01:38:36,780
but you're a more american than me,
man.

2235
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:39,540
You are an actual immigrant.
I was just lucky.

2236
01:38:40,410 --> 01:38:42,870
I got lucky that my grandparents,
parents,

2237
01:38:42,871 --> 01:38:45,390
my great grandparents were like,
fuck Italy.

2238
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:49,200
And they moved over with my grandparents
were little and Ireland too.

2239
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:51,750
Same thing.
My grandfather,

2240
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:54,870
great grandfather on my father's side,
same thing.

2241
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:57,090
They all just said,
fuck this place.

2242
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:01,770
And they brought their kids over and uh,
they had to figure out this new thing.

2243
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:04,020
It was a new thing.
Yeah.

2244
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:06,060
Yeah.
It wasn't wide open.

2245
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:08,070
I mean,
it's still kind of a new thing.

2246
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,640
We'll look at the history.

2247
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:10,670
Well,
look at it though,

2248
01:39:10,671 --> 01:39:11,504
like the tech world,
everyone's coming from everywhere to 

2249
01:39:14,901 --> 01:39:18,440
silicone to hear silicone beach.
Everyone's coming and you're like,

2250
01:39:18,441 --> 01:39:20,630
that's a fucking great thing.
It is a great because you're getting all

2251
01:39:20,631 --> 01:39:24,080
the best and smartest people coming here
and giving us their knowledge and you're

2252
01:39:24,081 --> 01:39:24,900
like,
why is that?

2253
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:25,733
Man?
That's fucking great.

2254
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:26,663
You know it's really interesting too is 
they're almost universally leaning left 

2255
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:33,270
if you look at all of these powerful 
tech giants,

2256
01:39:33,330 --> 01:39:34,163
whether it's even like social media 
companies like facebook and apple and 

2257
01:39:38,101 --> 01:39:38,934
they,
they almost predominantly lean left 

2258
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:42,653
despite the fact that they're worth 
billions of fucking dollars and their 

2259
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:48,560
main driving force in our account.

2260
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:50,520
I think that this is,
this is my,

2261
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:54,110
my problem because I don't know if 
they're leaning left necessarily.

2262
01:39:54,111 --> 01:39:59,111
They're backing things that are 
perceived as left leaning like that.

2263
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:01,993
Like for example,
if you have a fucking brain and you've 

2264
01:40:05,151 --> 01:40:08,210
talked to scientists and you've and 
you've read and you're like,

2265
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:09,800
oh shit,
we're up against the wall.

2266
01:40:09,801 --> 01:40:10,634
Like I say,
humans won't do anything until the 

2267
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:14,030
fucking guns to that.
The guns to the fucking head.

2268
01:40:14,290 --> 01:40:15,123
Right?
And so if you talk to any of these 

2269
01:40:16,371 --> 01:40:17,204
people,
it's like,

2270
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:20,180
okay,
yes,

2271
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,100
I fucking,
how do we fucking fix this?

2272
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:25,460
The fact that that's laughed or liberal,
that's stupid.

2273
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:26,900
Right?
And,

2274
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:27,793
and I don't understand it.
The other thing is you go onto like pot 

2275
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:31,790
for example,
we all know where it's going.

2276
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:34,610
Or if you want to talk about,
like for example,

2277
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:38,330
the women's march on civil rights.
We all know where we're fucking going.

2278
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:39,213
Yeah.
If you grew up as we did in the fucking 

2279
01:40:41,330 --> 01:40:43,640
modern age civil rights.
Okay.

2280
01:40:43,641 --> 01:40:45,330
We're not fucking going backwards.
Right?

2281
01:40:45,770 --> 01:40:48,890
How the fuck.
That became a fucking left thing too.

2282
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:50,780
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

2283
01:40:51,490 --> 01:40:53,710
I mean,
how is it not a right thing as it should

2284
01:40:53,711 --> 01:40:54,544
be?
One thing we will all meet in the 

2285
01:40:54,911 --> 01:40:55,744
middle,
one thing where we meet 100 percent in 

2286
01:40:57,131 --> 01:40:57,964
the middle and go,
look,

2287
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:00,190
there can't be racism anymore.
We gotta get.

2288
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,620
This doesn't make any fucking sense.
It's too old.

2289
01:41:02,621 --> 01:41:03,454
It's too stupid.
It's just an archaic monkey way of 

2290
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:09,340
thinking.
It's back to our primal tribal fact that

2291
01:41:09,341 --> 01:41:12,400
it's still on the fucking table.
Is this stupid?

2292
01:41:12,430 --> 01:41:13,720
Yeah,
it's fucking stupid.

2293
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:16,720
I feel the same way about gay rights.
I feel the exact same way.

2294
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,590
If you have a real problem with gay 
neighbor,

2295
01:41:19,610 --> 01:41:21,910
these,
these folks that lived down the street,

2296
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:23,890
they have a kid,
they adopted a kid,

2297
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,360
they have a fucking dog.
They walk by.

2298
01:41:25,361 --> 01:41:26,980
They're the nicest fucking people in the
world.

2299
01:41:26,981 --> 01:41:29,110
I feel like the fuck.
Do you care family?

2300
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:30,220
What the fuck do you care?

2301
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:32,050
Why would anybody care?
Why would anybody care?

2302
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:35,080
Civil rights,
gay rights,

2303
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:39,010
women's rights part of it.
We all know where we're going.

2304
01:41:39,011 --> 01:41:40,450
Exactly.
We all know where we're going,

2305
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:41,383
so why the fuck are we having these 
fights and fucking is because people on 

2306
01:41:44,081 --> 01:41:45,910
one look at mean you were talking about 
earlier,

2307
01:41:45,911 --> 01:41:46,744
the black lives matter.
People upset at the women's rights 

2308
01:41:47,891 --> 01:41:48,724
movement.
The trans community upset the women 

2309
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:53,710
wearing vaginas.
People are crazy for a fractious,

2310
01:41:53,711 --> 01:41:54,820
fractious,
yes,

2311
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,140
that's a good word.
I ever used it,

2312
01:41:56,141 --> 01:41:56,974
but I'm and start fucking thrown it 
around him and I think that this is why 

2313
01:41:59,801 --> 01:42:03,280
we need some sanity and you need some 
common sense and saying,

2314
01:42:03,281 --> 01:42:04,114
look,
people,

2315
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,310
we all know where we're getting this 
stuff,

2316
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:08,890
fighting each other.
We need psychedelic drugs.

2317
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:10,690
That's really what we need.
I mean,

2318
01:42:10,691 --> 01:42:15,691
this sounds stupid,
but mushrooms and ptsd as well also mtma

2319
01:42:18,251 --> 01:42:23,251
and ptsd and I wasa securing a lot of 
people smoking and alcoholism.

2320
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:25,960
Um,
and a heroin.

2321
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:26,920
Yeah.
And that's,

2322
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:27,813
a lot of that is also because they,
they need to get iowasca because 

2323
01:42:29,861 --> 01:42:30,694
dimethyltryptamine,
the active compound of it is illegal in 

2324
01:42:32,601 --> 01:42:34,670
the United States even though your body 
produces it and go.

2325
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:39,690
There's actually a clinics in Mexico 
again,

2326
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:42,673
which is an amazing one for heroin.
Rewires the mind if you have someone 

2327
01:42:46,781 --> 01:42:48,730
who,
you know as an opiod addiction,

2328
01:42:49,030 --> 01:42:51,310
my friend aggregate has a,
my friend ed clay,

2329
01:42:51,311 --> 01:42:52,144
he runs a center down in Mexico and he 
started it out because he had a problem 

2330
01:42:56,231 --> 01:42:58,930
with them.
He kicked them by using ibogaine and now

2331
01:42:58,931 --> 01:43:01,270
he's like,
we did a story on it and,

2332
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:04,800
and it's incredibly successful.
The guy who we follow through that,

2333
01:43:04,801 --> 01:43:06,490
he's still clean.
It's been incredibly.

2334
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:09,110
I mean,
I don't understand why,

2335
01:43:09,111 --> 01:43:10,390
if,
if things work,

2336
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:12,460
why we just can't say.
Okay.

2337
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:14,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

2338
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:14,801
Um,
well,

2339
01:43:14,801 --> 01:43:17,140
because again,
that's not on our team.

2340
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:21,850
Our team is clean and jesus and bibles 
and football and we're not taking trucks

2341
01:43:21,851 --> 01:43:22,684
like a bunch of god damn dirty hippy,
but it's so you want bernie sanders and 

2342
01:43:25,541 --> 01:43:28,780
you want drugs and it's also.
It's also a big pharma.

2343
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:29,670
Yeah,
that too.

2344
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:30,760
It was a lot of money.
Well,

2345
01:43:30,761 --> 01:43:32,980
they need to get high too.
That's part of the problem.

2346
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:36,520
Part of the problem is all these fucking
people that have already made a fuckload

2347
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:38,650
of money and they're trying to protect 
those investments.

2348
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:41,290
They are involved in these gigantic 
organizations,

2349
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:42,124
these corporations.
It becomes this diffusion of 

2350
01:43:43,841 --> 01:43:44,674
responsibility situation where you have 
all of these people acting in the 

2351
01:43:47,951 --> 01:43:50,140
benefit of the group or for the benefit 
of the group.

2352
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:51,213
Not thinking about everybody as 
individuals and justifying what they do 

2353
01:43:54,381 --> 01:43:55,670
by the fact that,
hey,

2354
01:43:55,671 --> 01:43:57,650
this is just business.
This is how it's done.

2355
01:43:57,651 --> 01:43:58,640
This how it's always done.

2356
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:01,950
There's enough fucking profit or 
rhetoric,

2357
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:02,833
there's enough and if you're in a 
business and you're only way to make 

2358
01:44:04,731 --> 01:44:06,950
profit is by eating babies and he go,
well look,

2359
01:44:06,951 --> 01:44:09,170
my country,
we've been eating babies over here for a

2360
01:44:09,171 --> 01:44:11,510
long time and we're not going to just 
stop eating babies.

2361
01:44:11,810 --> 01:44:13,340
No,
you have to stop eating babies.

2362
01:44:13,341 --> 01:44:16,910
We know it's not good now and I feel the
same way about fucking seaworld.

2363
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:21,200
They need to stop having dolphins and 
whales and orcas in captivity.

2364
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:23,600
Cut the shit.
Can't do that anymore.

2365
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:24,630
Like it's the same.
It's.

2366
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:27,350
There's a lot of things that we know are
bad,

2367
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:28,303
but we allow them to go on because 
they've gone on for a long time and I 

2368
01:44:31,551 --> 01:44:34,640
think that's.
I mean that's across the board.

2369
01:44:34,641 --> 01:44:37,100
There's a lot and those.
All of those,

2370
01:44:37,230 --> 01:44:38,063
they're being exposed now.
It's one of the more interesting things 

2371
01:44:39,831 --> 01:44:41,750
about this time is that because of all 
the.

2372
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:45,620
All the information that's out now about
opiate addictions,

2373
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:49,550
that's the reason why doctors prescribed
less and less now.

2374
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,620
That's the reason why they're under more
and more scrutiny.

2375
01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:55,160
It's not because of the doctors wanting 
to stop,

2376
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:57,793
stop.
It's because our information got out 

2377
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:00,133
drug in the last 10 years and it's 
because guys like you and advice got 

2378
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:05,640
fentanyl.
Yeah.

2379
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,610
What?
I know a guy who just died of it.

2380
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:09,081
Yeah,
I know.

2381
01:45:09,081 --> 01:45:10,880
I know.
A a martial arts guy.

2382
01:45:10,910 --> 01:45:12,530
Just fucking crazy.
It's great.

2383
01:45:12,531 --> 01:45:14,930
It's,
it's way more powerful than heroin,

2384
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:15,640
right?
Way more.

2385
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:19,550
400 times more powerful.
That's crazy.

2386
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:22,460
God damn it.
Fuck fucking looked at.

2387
01:45:22,470 --> 01:45:24,980
Oxies went not strong enough,
bro.

2388
01:45:25,670 --> 01:45:27,810
This stuff's for pussies.
Well,

2389
01:45:27,811 --> 01:45:28,644
the thing with fentanyl is you can take 
like one grain of it and then cut it 

2390
01:45:32,011 --> 01:45:35,120
into so and so.
It's just to go back to your point,

2391
01:45:35,121 --> 01:45:35,954
it's pure profit,
but the fact of the thing is people are 

2392
01:45:38,181 --> 01:45:39,710
dying like motherfuckers on it.

2393
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:40,670
Yeah.
And you're like,

2394
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,713
holy shit.
And people didn't know that they were 

2395
01:45:43,881 --> 01:45:47,540
addicted to fentanyl until they went in 
to try to get treated.

2396
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:48,500
And they're like,
oh shit,

2397
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:51,080
you're not addicted to heroin.
You're addicted to fentanyl,

2398
01:45:51,081 --> 01:45:53,860
which is even harder to kick.
God damn it.

2399
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,753
And it's synthetic and it's something 
that human beings have created and 

2400
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:59,070
created over the last 10 years.
Right?

2401
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:02,310
And there's not a lot of data on it as 
far as like,

2402
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:05,210
it's for like a,
you know,

2403
01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:07,610
operating on rhinoceros.
I mean it's,

2404
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:12,910
it's super fucking straw.
It's super strong were assholes,

2405
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:17,870
but to like the opioid overdoses are 
going through the roof.

2406
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:18,704
It's never been higher.
A deaths have never been higher and 

2407
01:46:21,330 --> 01:46:22,400
we're just sitting there going,
well,

2408
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:24,430
we're making this stuff.
Like we can stop making it.

2409
01:46:24,470 --> 01:46:27,200
Whoever is making that stuff is a 
monster.

2410
01:46:27,490 --> 01:46:29,780
If you're making that stuff,
you are a monster.

2411
01:46:29,810 --> 01:46:30,643
Whatever company that's making them.
The fact that the government hasn't 

2412
01:46:32,151 --> 01:46:32,984
stepped in trump immediately steps in 
and fucking stops the protests and the 

2413
01:46:37,161 --> 01:46:37,994
dakota pipeline and start that back up 
again and he doesn't do anything about 

2414
01:46:40,281 --> 01:46:41,840
fentanyl.
One hundred percent on that.

2415
01:46:41,841 --> 01:46:43,940
That's what numbers of deaths.
Jamie,

2416
01:46:43,941 --> 01:46:45,830
pull up the numbers of deaths and you 
know,

2417
01:46:45,831 --> 01:46:48,320
maybe it's not on his table.
Maybe people aren't bringing it to him,

2418
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,220
but goddamn shit.
Huge.

2419
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,083
It's a huge,
huge problem that the opioid addictions 

2420
01:46:54,061 --> 01:46:56,940
are going through the roof and death.
Let's guess,

2421
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:00,600
how many people a year do you think die 
from fentanyl in the United States?

2422
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:01,950
Well,
it just started,

2423
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:03,600
they just started being able to track 
it,

2424
01:47:03,601 --> 01:47:05,700
but I would say 50,000.
Oh,

2425
01:47:05,701 --> 01:47:06,534
I was going to say 19,000.
I don't know why I said I would say 

2426
01:47:08,491 --> 01:47:09,570
50,000.
Okay.

2427
01:47:09,810 --> 01:47:11,010
I'm going low.
He's going.

2428
01:47:11,011 --> 01:47:14,340
Hi jamie.
What are the numbers?

2429
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:15,870
Drum roll please.

2430
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:19,293
Readily pal.
Yet that's because the god damned 

2431
01:47:21,181 --> 01:47:23,390
pharmaceutical companies are fucking 
around with the man.

2432
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:27,000
Let's just see opioid overdoses in 2016.
What?

2433
01:47:27,001 --> 01:47:27,151
No,
no,

2434
01:47:27,151 --> 01:47:28,730
no.
We need to specifically find out.

2435
01:47:28,731 --> 01:47:29,010
Oh,
well,

2436
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:30,450
let's just go.
Let's just see what that is.

2437
01:47:30,451 --> 01:47:31,920
It'll see.
It'll give us ballpark.

2438
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:37,190
That's going to be a lot for opioid 
overdoses in the United States.

2439
01:47:37,561 --> 01:47:39,870
I'm going with $75,000.
When you say,

2440
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:41,980
I don't know,
you don't get you gotta?

2441
01:47:41,981 --> 01:47:43,470
Yes.
Can't say I don't know.

2442
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:44,960
I went,
okay.

2443
01:47:45,070 --> 01:47:47,140
Okay,
so we're fine.

2444
01:47:47,490 --> 01:47:49,800
Because you gotta think like,
oh that's overdose deaths.

2445
01:47:49,801 --> 01:47:51,180
Deaths.
That's a lot.

2446
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:52,770
Like that's a ton.
Right?

2447
01:47:52,771 --> 01:47:53,604
But I bet it's probably accurate.
I mean you think about the $350 million 

2448
01:47:56,611 --> 01:48:00,870
people and I think there's something 
like $39 million that are on.

2449
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,040
Oh,
it's something insane.

2450
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:03,473
Insane.
The number of people that are on 

2451
01:48:04,291 --> 01:48:06,360
painkillers.
It's fucking bananas.

2452
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:07,553
What do we got here?

2453
01:48:08,110 --> 01:48:08,430
Do,
do,

2454
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:09,630
do 50,
$2,000.

2455
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:10,950
Bam.
You're a monster.

2456
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:12,540
You fucking nailed it.
Look at you.

2457
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:14,060
Well I got 52.
I got a.

2458
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:15,700
Hold on.
I had 50,000

2459
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:16,573
on drugs.
Drug over those 15 opioids driving this 

2460
01:48:21,961 --> 01:48:23,550
epidemic with 20,000.
Oh,

2461
01:48:23,551 --> 01:48:25,890
so I was right.
There you go.

2462
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:29,310
That's 20 slash 15 slash 16 I believe.
He was like,

2463
01:48:29,311 --> 01:48:31,710
yeah,
it was close to 75.

2464
01:48:31,711 --> 01:48:32,940
I think.
Jesus christ.

2465
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:35,070
So it ramped up that much.
It's going.

2466
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:37,420
God,
I believe it's doubled in the past three

2467
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:41,140
years in 2016.
Is that maybe it's not open.

2468
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:43,830
It's probably not out yet.
They're still counting up.

2469
01:48:43,831 --> 01:48:45,810
The body's.
She's fucked up.

2470
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:49,050
Fucking crazy.
It's just crazy.

2471
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,180
And um,
find out this,

2472
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:53,070
um,
what are the number?

2473
01:48:53,071 --> 01:48:55,290
They don't give you the number of people
that are on them,

2474
01:48:55,291 --> 01:48:56,124
but they'll give you the number of 
prescriptions for 2015 and 16 for 

2475
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:01,734
opiates.

2476
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,350
No,
I think you get that number.

2477
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:06,900
I think it's $39 million.
Jesus.

2478
01:49:07,110 --> 01:49:07,943
I think that's what I had read,
that there was $39 million 

2479
01:49:09,631 --> 01:49:12,810
prescriptions,
which is one out of 10,

2480
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:17,310
but it's not really because like,
like how many times did they refill it?

2481
01:49:17,490 --> 01:49:18,420
Right.
Is it that,

2482
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,310
is it,
when you say someone has a prescription,

2483
01:49:20,610 --> 01:49:24,180
are you saying you had your,
it's prescribed to you or are you saying

2484
01:49:24,181 --> 01:49:28,890
I write you a new prescription when it 
runs at 39 million people on opioids is.

2485
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,680
I mean that's a large country.
Yeah it is,

2486
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:35,280
but that's one out of 10.
It's more than one out of 10.

2487
01:49:35,310 --> 01:49:36,300
If it's,
um,

2488
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:39,090
if it's,
if it's per person.

2489
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:41,580
Yeah,
I don't think it is per person.

2490
01:49:41,581 --> 01:49:43,020
No,
I think it's per prescription.

2491
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:43,883
So like,
like you might be able to have five 

2492
01:49:44,701 --> 01:49:47,010
prescriptions over the course of a year,
you know,

2493
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,130
but then again they don't

2494
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:53,130
know because a lot of it is illegal.
That's the majority of the problem.

2495
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:53,951
Yeah.
Yeah.

2496
01:49:53,951 --> 01:49:54,784
I mean I would,
I would gather that probably half of it 

2497
01:49:56,651 --> 01:50:00,910
is illegal at least because.
Because you got illegal stuff,

2498
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:05,260
pills coming in from all over the world 
and Mexico and then people.

2499
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:08,590
So the story we did on it was they get 
addicted to oxy,

2500
01:50:08,770 --> 01:50:12,220
then they can't afford it because our 
are more expensive than heroin.

2501
01:50:12,370 --> 01:50:14,290
I don't know how the fuck that happened,
I guess whatever.

2502
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:15,483
And then they're doing heroin because 
it's cheaper than fentanyl because it's 

2503
01:50:19,721 --> 01:50:20,554
cheaper still and stronger.
And there's that whole thing of like 

2504
01:50:23,351 --> 01:50:24,184
when someone dies of a heroin overdose,
everyone goes to their dealer and buys 

2505
01:50:27,161 --> 01:50:28,570
from them because oh,
then it's really strong.

2506
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:32,530
So that's another reason why fentanyl is
going through the roof.

2507
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:33,543
Isn't that amazing?
It's such a bizarre state that we're in 

2508
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:38,793
when it comes to that.
And then there's all sorts of other 

2509
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:41,920
prescription pills that people are 
taking you.

2510
01:50:41,921 --> 01:50:43,690
How many people are addicted to xanax?

2511
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,153
You know,
not a lot of them are dropping like 

2512
01:50:45,801 --> 01:50:47,450
flies,
but it's a huge issue.

2513
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:50,250
And all these wives

2514
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:51,540
is that.
I meet in these,

2515
01:50:51,541 --> 01:50:54,300
like these wealthy communities,

2516
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:58,500
all these people and there like so many 
fucking people are on xanax.

2517
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:00,133
They're laughing about.
I'll just have a xanax on the glass of 

2518
01:51:01,641 --> 01:51:02,474
wine,
like how many of you fuckers are on 

2519
01:51:05,151 --> 01:51:05,984
xanax?
Some lady was at the comedy or at the 

2520
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:10,460
improv the other night and she was so 
comfortable.

2521
01:51:10,461 --> 01:51:11,630
Heckling.
She was in the front row.

2522
01:51:11,631 --> 01:51:13,520
She's an older lady and she was a little
drunk.

2523
01:51:13,521 --> 01:51:14,354
She's tipsy,
but she was so comfortable hecklin and 

2524
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:18,080
chat it up and I go,
let me guess.

2525
01:51:18,081 --> 01:51:18,914
I go,
you had a glass of wine and xanax and 

2526
01:51:20,481 --> 01:51:23,690
she fucking got up and high fived me.
She was laughing.

2527
01:51:23,691 --> 01:51:25,050
Yes,
yes,

2528
01:51:25,150 --> 01:51:26,440
yes,
you're right.

2529
01:51:27,230 --> 01:51:28,640
And I go,
do you take that all the time?

2530
01:51:28,641 --> 01:51:29,570
She's like,
all the time.

2531
01:51:29,571 --> 01:51:30,650
I can't get along without it.

2532
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:31,833
Wasn't there a stat I remember this,
that and hopefully we can pull it way 

2533
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:37,311
too much work.
Right.

2534
01:51:37,311 --> 01:51:38,144
He's confused.
But there was a stat that like 50 

2535
01:51:40,661 --> 01:51:45,150
percent of the country was on 
pharmaceutical,

2536
01:51:45,230 --> 01:51:48,610
some sort of like xanax or this or that 
or whatever.

2537
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:51,760
Booze and the other 50 percent was on,
you know,

2538
01:51:52,150 --> 01:51:54,940
pot or coke or this or that.
Which kind of makes sense.

2539
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:56,230
Yeah.
And so you're like,

2540
01:51:56,260 --> 01:51:57,470
basically,
you know,

2541
01:51:57,480 --> 01:51:58,720
it reminded me,
reminded me of,

2542
01:51:58,721 --> 01:52:01,060
um,
like platoon when,

2543
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:02,313
when elias is dudes were all smoking pot
and they were like the freaks and then 

2544
01:52:05,321 --> 01:52:07,810
the other dudes were drinking whiskey 
and beer and whatever,

2545
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:09,610
and it's like,
it's sort of like,

2546
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:11,343
those are your tribes.
Like the freaks and the crazy guys were 

2547
01:52:14,891 --> 01:52:17,890
smoking the weed and the good know 
hardcore guy,

2548
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:21,070
whatever his name was,
the tom berenger character.

2549
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:23,320
They were the wild Turkey drinkers.

2550
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,930
And,
but if you just look at it,

2551
01:52:25,931 --> 01:52:26,321
you're like,
well,

2552
01:52:26,321 --> 01:52:31,280
everybody in the country in some form or
another is taken some,

2553
01:52:31,670 --> 01:52:33,310
right?
Yeah.

2554
01:52:33,410 --> 01:52:34,243
But if not,
then they're going to aa meetings and 

2555
01:52:35,531 --> 01:52:38,100
smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee 
them.

2556
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,790
That's really what's going on,
man.

2557
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,230
You know,
what do we got here?

2558
01:52:41,231 --> 01:52:44,200
Jamie got some stats.
Fifty two american,

2559
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:45,413
that's even 52 million americans use 
prescription drugs for nonmedical 

2560
01:52:49,701 --> 01:52:50,534
reasons of these once in their lifetime.
So that means people that are 

2561
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:54,380
recreationally taking,
yeah.

2562
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:58,010
Uh,
probably no painkillers.

2563
01:52:58,011 --> 01:53:02,000
Death by overdose is including involving
prescription painkillers quadrupled.

2564
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:04,670
Wow,
that's incredible.

2565
01:53:04,671 --> 01:53:05,504
More than six point $5.
Million people above the age of 11 used 

2566
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:12,290
prescription drugs for nonmedical 
reasons in 2013 more than cocaine.

2567
01:53:14,090 --> 01:53:14,923
Cocaine number looks unbelievably low.
I think that's New York on a friday 

2568
01:53:18,621 --> 01:53:20,360
night.
Santa monica.

2569
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:25,760
There's a liar's total number of retail 
drug prescriptions in 2015.

2570
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:28,430
It's 4 billion.
Sixty $5 million.

2571
01:53:28,431 --> 01:53:30,350
One hundred 75,000.
Sixty four.

2572
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:34,310
Holy shit.
We are fucking.

2573
01:53:34,311 --> 01:53:36,590
We've been evaded.
You're a good researcher.

2574
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:37,970
He's a bad mother.
Good.

2575
01:53:38,570 --> 01:53:40,130
We've been in vico.
Look how.

2576
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:44,510
Look at Alabama who come in strong 
families at the top.

2577
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:45,910
It's just.
Oh,

2578
01:53:45,911 --> 01:53:46,744
I see.
I see.

2579
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:48,470
Oh yeah,
California though.

2580
01:53:48,471 --> 01:53:50,130
Oh my god.
Four hundred $58 million.

2581
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:52,243
We're taking it.
we're taking it out here in Florida is 

2582
01:53:54,061 --> 01:53:56,250
just.
We're number one New York.

2583
01:53:56,690 --> 01:53:57,523
That's hilarious at flora's number two 
because it's way less people in Florida 

2584
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:01,680
and you're just above New York.
Wow.

2585
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:02,691
Wow,
dude.

2586
01:54:02,691 --> 01:54:05,090
We're.
There's way less people in Florida.

2587
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:09,050
Ohio is way up there for ohio's.
You grew up their kid.

2588
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:11,060
You know what's up?
You got to get fucked up.

2589
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:14,070
You fucked up.
You want to get through where?

2590
01:54:14,110 --> 01:54:15,350
We're in Ohio,
columbus,

2591
01:54:15,351 --> 01:54:19,120
Ohio.
a lot of punk bands from there,

2592
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:24,850
a reason why it's fucking blue gray and 
all through winter go outside.

2593
01:54:25,110 --> 01:54:28,070
It's no goddamn clouds,
just a dark roast or no sun.

2594
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:31,310
Just darkness and gloomy and heroin and 
pills.

2595
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:32,930
Pills.
Yeah man,

2596
01:54:32,931 --> 01:54:35,450
it's not good and I don't know how to 
get that out of the system.

2597
01:54:35,451 --> 01:54:36,284
That's like a.
That's like having a computer virus and 

2598
01:54:38,391 --> 01:54:40,280
you bring it to the computer guy and 
he's like,

2599
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:41,830
oh jesus.
It's in everYthing.

2600
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:44,090
That's also another reason why we're all
fucked up.

2601
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:46,060
We said everybody's just,
you know,

2602
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:49,200
drugging themseLves and oh,
fucking opioids in new.

2603
01:54:51,010 --> 01:54:52,410
And the cynics will say,
well you're,

2604
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:55,520
you're a fucking pot hood talking about 
that and you're a pothead.

2605
01:54:55,850 --> 01:54:56,720
What's the difference,
bro?

2606
01:54:57,750 --> 01:54:59,930
That's pot stupid.
First of all.

2607
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:00,681
Second of.
well,

2608
01:55:00,681 --> 01:55:02,090
it doesn't,
doesn't do anything bad to you.

2609
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:03,133
It's already been established.
Obviously know no one's trying to stop 

2610
01:55:06,770 --> 01:55:09,080
whiskey.
No one's trying to stop wine.

2611
01:55:09,230 --> 01:55:13,100
Not trying to stop people from taking 
things that are manageable.

2612
01:55:13,370 --> 01:55:15,350
There is nothing manageable about 
fentanyl.

2613
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:20,510
If you're rolling the dice with death 
every time you're doing something that's

2614
01:55:20,511 --> 01:55:21,680
not good.
And also,

2615
01:55:21,681 --> 01:55:24,110
if you're getting addicted like that and
you just can't,

2616
01:55:24,310 --> 01:55:25,143
you can't do anything about it,
then that's just stupid and it's way 

2617
01:55:27,861 --> 01:55:29,210
harder to kick.
He said,

2618
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:32,180
yeah,
I mean it's,

2619
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:34,670
it's much stronger.
So obviously needed that,

2620
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:36,620
like,
who approved that,

2621
01:55:36,970 --> 01:55:39,230
what was it was for animals.
And then they said,

2622
01:55:39,260 --> 01:55:40,820
oh,
we can just cut this.

2623
01:55:40,821 --> 01:55:42,740
And it's sort of like super strong 
heroin.

2624
01:55:44,170 --> 01:55:45,690
It's like pcp,
right?

2625
01:55:45,691 --> 01:55:48,960
Pcp was a,
an animal tranquilizer.

2626
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:49,943
I know,
but it's just amazing that someone 

2627
01:55:50,821 --> 01:55:53,610
greenlit that,
that they look at goal on paper seems to

2628
01:55:53,611 --> 01:55:55,590
be an order.
Let's go roll it out.

2629
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:56,910
Well,
how many.

2630
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:58,043
This is my thing,
how many hippopotamuses and rhinos are 

2631
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:03,030
we traCking because somebody must've 
looked at at some point and said,

2632
01:56:03,031 --> 01:56:05,480
fuck,
this is a lot of hippopotamus.

2633
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:07,220
Is getting their livers removed here in,
uh,

2634
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:09,720
in New York city.
Jesus christ.

2635
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:11,520
Yeah.
Well,

2636
01:56:11,550 --> 01:56:12,383
once those woolly mammoths start fucking
roman through Russia and chew and 

2637
01:56:14,581 --> 01:56:15,310
everything,
we needed it.

2638
01:56:15,310 --> 01:56:18,840
I'd have to shoot him with darts.
Going to have to try and check them out,

2639
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:20,340
make sure they're not doing anything 
weird.

2640
01:56:20,341 --> 01:56:22,050
We need the mammoths,
we need the mammoth.

2641
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:24,150
Make sure that all evolving.
Honest.

2642
01:56:24,870 --> 01:56:27,270
Yeah,
we're times man.

2643
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:28,321
Really,
really,

2644
01:56:28,321 --> 01:56:29,154
really weird times and more weird I 
think than any other time in human 

2645
01:56:32,251 --> 01:56:34,110
history for sure.
And you know,

2646
01:56:34,140 --> 01:56:38,160
if we believe in moore's law then it's 
going to just go like you're saying,

2647
01:56:38,670 --> 01:56:43,230
we have this technology now.
We can't even like it Used to be like,

2648
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:46,290
oh,
50 years from now we'll write about five

2649
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:47,124
years from now,
we don't know what the fuck's going to 

2650
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,620
happen.
All this shit is just like,

2651
01:56:49,621 --> 01:56:50,820
well,
we can,

2652
01:56:50,860 --> 01:56:51,693
you know,
map the genome and now we can edit the 

2653
01:56:53,281 --> 01:56:53,640
genome.

2654
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:55,620
Now we can reverSe aging.
NOw we can do this now.

2655
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:57,540
And you'Re jusT sitting there going,
holy shit.

2656
01:56:57,541 --> 01:57:00,330
This is hAppening in real time.
So quicklY.

2657
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:01,610
And,
and,

2658
01:57:01,670 --> 01:57:06,670
and because of that and the sort of the 
speed is ramping up.

2659
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:10,880
I kinda like it though,
because you knoW,

2660
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,140
I do a lot of medical research and I'm 
like,

2661
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:14,890
um,
you know,

2662
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:15,733
one of the reasons why I'm not drinking 
here is because I got to go for my 

2663
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:18,533
annual physical and I'm going to go in 
and not have too much booze or whatever 

2664
01:57:21,781 --> 01:57:22,614
my body.
But what's interesting about it is they 

2665
01:57:24,931 --> 01:57:26,760
map your shit and they check out your 
shit and they say,

2666
01:57:26,761 --> 01:57:28,260
well this is going to happen or that can
happen,

2667
01:57:28,261 --> 01:57:30,300
whatever else.
but you sitting there and you go,

2668
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:31,433
in five years,
you're going to have aggressive 

2669
01:57:34,831 --> 01:57:38,520
therapies if not cures for many forms of
cancer.

2670
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:40,380
So you're just sitting there going,
please,

2671
01:57:40,381 --> 01:57:41,214
for fuck's sakes,
just just get me another fucking 10 

2672
01:57:43,201 --> 01:57:44,034
years.
Yeah.

2673
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:44,873
So that I can get to this sort of stage.
And I think a Lot of people with a lot 

2674
01:57:48,181 --> 01:57:52,170
of diseases that hitherto have been 
incurable are sitting there going,

2675
01:57:52,171 --> 01:57:53,004
come on,
come on,

2676
01:57:53,050 --> 01:57:54,330
come on.
Like,

2677
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,530
you know,
beCause it's just,

2678
01:57:55,531 --> 01:57:57,100
it's,
it's going exponentially.

2679
01:57:57,101 --> 01:57:57,934
And when you can map the genome,
then you can figure this out and we can 

2680
01:57:59,581 --> 01:58:00,840
rewire that fucking thing.
And,

2681
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:02,213
well,
there's also more understanding about 

2682
01:58:02,701 --> 01:58:03,534
nutrition now than ever before and the 
causes of all these illnesses and a big 

2683
01:58:06,031 --> 01:58:07,410
part of that is inflammation,
gut,

2684
01:58:07,830 --> 01:58:08,820
gut health,
gut health,

2685
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:09,923
gut health.
And that pertains to a lot of it 

2686
01:58:11,221 --> 01:58:13,110
pertains to your diet,
you know,

2687
01:58:13,111 --> 01:58:13,944
and uh,
also the overprescription of 

2688
01:58:15,091 --> 01:58:16,180
antibiotics.
I was listening.

2689
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:18,520
Posture is your bio.
Yeah.

2690
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:20,730
I was listening to this podcast today 
where they were discussing,

2691
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:23,940
this one was discussing having a.

2692
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,910
She had some sort of a,
an illness and they gave her too.

2693
01:58:27,970 --> 01:58:28,803
Oh,
she had an ear infection and they gave 

2694
01:58:29,761 --> 01:58:34,650
her two big doses of antibiotics and she
was fucked up for a decade.

2695
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:36,990
Just her.
She just had constant pain,

2696
01:58:36,991 --> 01:58:39,330
chronic pain,
all these illnesses and injuries.

2697
01:58:39,510 --> 01:58:44,010
And then finally she went to a 
homeopathic doctor and the doctor sorted

2698
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:47,890
out with probiotics and she'd bullshit.
She was saying like the woman,

2699
01:58:47,891 --> 01:58:50,590
her name was like snowflake and her 
child was moon child,

2700
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:53,120
don't have the exact card,
was not started.

2701
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:54,550
It was a great,
great,

2702
01:58:54,551 --> 01:58:57,730
great doctor called dr lipman.
He's an internist.

2703
01:58:58,270 --> 01:59:02,150
And what happened was I had a stomach 
eating flesh eating stomach parasite.

2704
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:05,050
Oh jesus and dysentery.
You've got an Afghanistan.

2705
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:07,930
I came back and I was in trouble.
I was,

2706
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:11,020
went to the sort of tropical disease 
center and they're like,

2707
01:59:11,021 --> 01:59:12,880
holy shit,
we have to get this out.

2708
01:59:13,650 --> 01:59:15,520
Uh,
and so what did it look like?

2709
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:18,310
Well,
I took super strong,

2710
01:59:18,370 --> 01:59:19,203
super,
super strong antibiotics and afterwards 

2711
01:59:22,841 --> 01:59:24,250
I was like,
I'm fucked up.

2712
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:26,200
Like I'm,
I'm seriously fucked up here.

2713
01:59:26,201 --> 01:59:27,034
I can't get out of bed.
Like I messed up and this guy goes like 

2714
01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:31,540
this internist.
You got to go see him.

2715
01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:34,930
So it goes to him and he's just like,
you need a ton of pro box,

2716
01:59:34,931 --> 01:59:36,970
you need to rebuild your bio.
Right?

2717
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:38,193
And so I did,
I just took a ton of probiotics and he 

2718
01:59:40,461 --> 01:59:43,000
put me on the shit whenever I was a new 
man.

2719
01:59:43,060 --> 01:59:43,590
Right?
Because,

2720
01:59:43,590 --> 01:59:44,423
because all your immune system,
everything is there like the now they 

2721
01:59:46,541 --> 01:59:48,390
found out.
So you know,

2722
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:49,533
what was happening was cdf and crohn's 
disease and all these things were 

2723
01:59:52,301 --> 01:59:53,134
happening because there was super bugs 
and hospitals because they were over 

2724
01:59:55,311 --> 01:59:58,330
prescribing antibiotics,
antibiotics.

2725
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:03,720
And so they started doing a fecal 
transplants,

2726
02:00:05,010 --> 02:00:06,040
have healthy shit.

2727
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:08,360
I tried to explain that to someone they 
thought I was joking and read.

2728
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:09,213
Does your bio,
and by the way it was incurable before 

2729
02:00:11,051 --> 02:00:11,884
people are dying.
And then they do a fecal transplant and 

2730
02:00:14,471 --> 02:00:15,610
they're cured.
Why?

2731
02:00:15,790 --> 02:00:18,200
Because it replenishes your biome,
right?

2732
02:00:18,730 --> 02:00:21,670
And you're completely destroying it with
antibiotics.

2733
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:22,533
We did a piece on it,
the post antibiotic world where they 

2734
02:00:23,741 --> 02:00:24,574
just stopped working.
And if you don't come up with shit like 

2735
02:00:26,501 --> 02:00:28,300
fecal transplants,
you're fucking dead.

2736
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:31,240
So I went through that and I've got to 
say,

2737
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:34,000
you know,
fucking let's spend some money on that.

2738
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:34,893
Look at this.
Autism symptoms improve after fecal 

2739
02:00:36,551 --> 02:00:38,260
transplant.
Small study finds.

2740
02:00:38,261 --> 02:00:38,800
That's.
Yeah,

2741
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:42,040
they're finding out that it has 
something to do with a autistic,

2742
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:44,710
um,
parkinson's and alzheimer's.

2743
02:00:44,711 --> 02:00:45,544
Yeah.
But the severity of autism symptoms and 

2744
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:50,883
all the traits that they exhibit that 
something has to do with their gut 

2745
02:00:53,081 --> 02:00:53,890
biome.

2746
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:56,260
And if you can make the gut biome 
healthy,

2747
02:00:56,350 --> 02:00:58,570
radically improve parkinson's and 
alzheimer's starts in,

2748
02:00:58,571 --> 02:00:59,780
your gut,
moves up,

2749
02:00:59,790 --> 02:01:01,990
starts to plaque.
And that's another thing that apparently

2750
02:01:01,991 --> 02:01:05,560
has a giant effect on people with autism
is medical marijuana,

2751
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:07,930
medical marijuana,
especially edible marijuana.

2752
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:12,070
I have a friend and he moved to 
Washington state particularly because of

2753
02:01:12,071 --> 02:01:12,904
that,
because when they made it legal and 

2754
02:01:14,351 --> 02:01:16,750
another friend who is a kid who's also 
autistic,

2755
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:21,340
moved to Colorado for that reason,
get it easily and people with cancer.

2756
02:01:21,341 --> 02:01:22,174
We have a storY of all these parents who
are like bible thumpers who found the 

2757
02:01:27,791 --> 02:01:29,740
only thing that worked with cbd and 
they're like,

2758
02:01:29,741 --> 02:01:30,574
fuck it,
we're moving from Texas and wherever to 

2759
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:36,070
to Washington and Colorado because it's 
the only thing that helps my kid.

2760
02:01:36,071 --> 02:01:38,980
And Here's my message to them.
If you believe in god,

2761
02:01:38,990 --> 02:01:40,130
you got to believe that god made

2762
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,963
marijuana.
You know it's man that decided it was 

2763
02:01:42,681 --> 02:01:44,900
bad for you.
It's not god.

2764
02:01:45,150 --> 02:01:47,270
It's not logic.
It's definitely not science.

2765
02:01:47,570 --> 02:01:48,403
There's just some bullshit propaganda 
that got stuck to it in the 19 thirties 

2766
02:01:51,831 --> 02:01:55,190
and we're still trying to shake it off.
That's really what's going on.

2767
02:01:55,191 --> 02:01:58,060
It Has nothing to do with what's right 
or what not to do.

2768
02:01:58,061 --> 02:01:59,990
A lot of fun in the thirties.
They didn't want booze.

2769
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:02,330
It was right after that.
Actually.

2770
02:02:02,331 --> 02:02:03,164
It was right after they had gotten 
through the prohibition that they 

2771
02:02:07,101 --> 02:02:10,060
decided to go after marijuana and that's
really what had happened at all.

2772
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:11,840
It all happened because of William 
Randolph hearst.

2773
02:02:12,350 --> 02:02:14,740
You know the whole story behind it?
Oh god dammit.

2774
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:15,593
I've told it a tHousand times,
so I'll give you the abbreviated 

2775
02:02:17,001 --> 02:02:17,834
version.
William randolph hearst owned hearst 

2776
02:02:19,581 --> 02:02:20,690
publications,
newspapers.

2777
02:02:20,691 --> 02:02:21,524
He also owned paper mills and they came 
out with this machine called the 

2778
02:02:24,891 --> 02:02:25,760
decorticator.

2779
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:28,510
That allowed them to much more 
effectively process hemp fiber.

2780
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:30,400
A machine.
That process did hemp,

2781
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:32,930
makes us superior paper and makes 
superior cloth.

2782
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:33,783
It makes appear you can eat it.
The hemp seeds and nutritious as 

2783
02:02:36,171 --> 02:02:39,590
essential medial central fatty acids,
all the amino acids.

2784
02:02:39,591 --> 02:02:41,540
It's this amazing plant.
It's like an alien planet,

2785
02:02:41,541 --> 02:02:45,230
and he decides to demonize it because he
doesn't want to convert his wood,

2786
02:02:45,231 --> 02:02:48,890
his trees that he's turning into paper.
He doesn't want to convert it to him and

2787
02:02:48,891 --> 02:02:49,724
spend millions of dollars.
So instead he starts publishing stories 

2788
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:52,933
about mexicans and blacks that are 
taking this new drug called marijuana 

2789
02:02:56,211 --> 02:02:58,640
and raping white women.
This drug,

2790
02:02:58,641 --> 02:03:00,650
marijuana wasn't even the name for 
cannabis.

2791
02:03:00,651 --> 02:03:04,070
They when they made cannabis outlaw,
when they made it illegal,

2792
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:04,993
when they made marijuana illegal,
they didn't even know they were making 

2793
02:03:06,891 --> 02:03:07,724
hemp illegal.
They didn't know because the general 

2794
02:03:10,071 --> 02:03:10,904
public did not know it was the same 
thing because this word marijuana was 

2795
02:03:13,701 --> 02:03:16,040
never associated with a hamp or with 
cannabis.

2796
02:03:16,250 --> 02:03:20,810
Marijuana was a wild mexican tobacco,
totally unrelated to cannabis.

2797
02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:21,823
They called it marijuana so that they 
could demonize it and that's when they 

2798
02:03:24,321 --> 02:03:25,154
funded reefer madness and all those 
crazy propaganda movies and posters and 

2799
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:29,753
we are still to this day trying to shake
off what William Randolph hearst and 

2800
02:03:33,741 --> 02:03:34,574
harry anslinger did in the 19 thirties.
It's a very interesting anecdote that 

2801
02:03:39,381 --> 02:03:40,214
sort of is very pertinent to what's 
happening today where you can just make 

2802
02:03:44,001 --> 02:03:46,220
up a story about something and then it's
fucking.

2803
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:49,970
It's the truth.
It's really perfect.

2804
02:03:49,971 --> 02:03:52,430
It's the perfect way to connect it to.
I mean,

2805
02:03:52,431 --> 02:03:55,550
we're still dealing with that problem 
from almost 100 years ago.

2806
02:03:55,620 --> 02:03:58,430
It was crazy.
It's bananas and it's a.

2807
02:03:58,670 --> 02:04:01,280
It could happen again.
You know what we're looking at right now

2808
02:04:01,281 --> 02:04:04,640
is not a rigid,
completely rock solid civilization.

2809
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:07,670
All it would take is one asteroidal 
impact,

2810
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:08,713
one killing of the power grid,
one mean what something happens to 

2811
02:04:12,900 --> 02:04:13,160
media.

2812
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:16,640
Shower happens and it kills off 30 
percent of the population and permafrost

2813
02:04:16,970 --> 02:04:17,803
permafrost.
That could happen and there's so many 

2814
02:04:20,301 --> 02:04:22,340
things that could go wrong.
Yellowstone,

2815
02:04:22,730 --> 02:04:25,880
they have thousands of earthquakes in 
yellowstone every year.

2816
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:26,743
It's a giant called dara volcano that at
one point in time blew up and killed 

2817
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:33,590
everything on the continent.
Every six to 800,000

2818
02:04:33,591 --> 02:04:35,870
years it goes and when it goes,
that's a wrap.

2819
02:04:35,871 --> 02:04:36,704
Babies in the last time it went 600,000
years ago and we have thousands of 

2820
02:04:40,801 --> 02:04:41,634
earthquakes every year in yellowstone.
You go there and you watch steam 

2821
02:04:45,210 --> 02:04:49,230
shooting out of the ground because the 
fucking boiling magma is so close to the

2822
02:04:49,231 --> 02:04:53,520
surface that the rivers and streams in 
the underground water runs into it,

2823
02:04:53,521 --> 02:04:56,610
heats it up and shoots it up in the sky 
on a regular basis.

2824
02:04:56,820 --> 02:04:57,653
It's fucking bananas.
What I love about that is everyone who 

2825
02:04:59,811 --> 02:05:01,710
goes and says,
look that that's fucking awesome.

2826
02:05:01,710 --> 02:05:04,170
Yeah,
it's really cool,

2827
02:05:04,430 --> 02:05:05,263
but it's.
It's totally possible that that fucking 

2828
02:05:07,801 --> 02:05:11,190
thing with very little notice could blow
and if it blows,

2829
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:14,490
we were dead because it's too.
Or too close to it,

2830
02:05:14,491 --> 02:05:16,980
which it's in Montana.
That's not far enough away.

2831
02:05:16,981 --> 02:05:19,200
I mean maybe some people in the east 
coast to survive,

2832
02:05:19,470 --> 02:05:20,303
but they're going to go into nuclear 
winter and it's going to fuck up 

2833
02:05:21,991 --> 02:05:24,180
everybody all over the world,
but that's why,

2834
02:05:25,150 --> 02:05:28,230
speaking about technology that you know,
if you ever talked to,

2835
02:05:28,260 --> 02:05:30,420
for example,
our guy on our council of elders,

2836
02:05:30,421 --> 02:05:31,710
ilan musk,
he's like,

2837
02:05:31,711 --> 02:05:35,160
why would be,
why are we a single planetary species?

2838
02:05:35,161 --> 02:05:39,180
Why wouldn't we just hedge our bets and 
have by planetary species?

2839
02:05:39,181 --> 02:05:40,014
Because if something does go wrong,
at least you've got your data and your 

2840
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:46,380
culture and your people and whatever,
and why wouldn't you do that?

2841
02:05:46,381 --> 02:05:47,214
If you could do that?

2842
02:05:47,410 --> 02:05:48,510
When they put it that way,
you're like,

2843
02:05:48,890 --> 02:05:50,070
sort of makes sense because everyone's 
like,

2844
02:05:50,130 --> 02:05:50,963
oh,
you want to live on mars was crazy 

2845
02:05:51,740 --> 02:05:52,573
nurse.
There's no evidence that We can live 

2846
02:05:53,371 --> 02:05:56,550
there though.
The real problem is we can't really stay

2847
02:05:56,551 --> 02:06:00,180
in that atmosphere for very long,
but I mean they can make fucking.

2848
02:06:00,210 --> 02:06:02,100
Yeah,
but even that we're still dealing with a

2849
02:06:02,101 --> 02:06:02,934
lesser gravity.
It's gonna have massive health 

2850
02:06:04,111 --> 02:06:05,940
consequences for the people that decided
to move there.

2851
02:06:06,030 --> 02:06:06,863
Got it.
But I'm just saying that's their 

2852
02:06:08,281 --> 02:06:11,220
argument.
We should argue multiplanetary species.

2853
02:06:11,250 --> 02:06:12,083
It's a good argument and it's also 
arguable that with all this crispr 

2854
02:06:14,461 --> 02:06:15,294
technology,
they might be able to figure out some 

2855
02:06:16,141 --> 02:06:18,860
sort of a medical solution for people 
that do move to a,

2856
02:06:19,060 --> 02:06:21,690
you know,
the moon has one sixth earth gravity,

2857
02:06:21,890 --> 02:06:22,723
you know,
there might be some way that they could 

2858
02:06:23,551 --> 02:06:25,620
figure out a way to colonize the moon 
and you know,

2859
02:06:25,650 --> 02:06:26,483
develop some sort of a new technology.
Have crazy shit about permafrost 

2860
02:06:31,320 --> 02:06:32,730
terraforming and shit.
Yeah,

2861
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:33,750
yeah,
yeah.

2862
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:36,000
Creating an atmosphere.
Why don't they do that here?

2863
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:41,130
You have to use nukes to do it in march.
Oh,

2864
02:06:41,131 --> 02:06:42,930
that's right.
They have to nuke the Polls.

2865
02:06:42,931 --> 02:06:44,020
Right.
They knew couple.

2866
02:06:44,070 --> 02:06:45,810
Wonderful.
What a good idea.

2867
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:48,510
Jesus christ.
Anytime your.

2868
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:50,610
That sounds like something a little kid 
would come up with.

2869
02:06:50,900 --> 02:06:52,860
How are you going to solve this?
What we're going to draw up some fucking

2870
02:06:52,861 --> 02:06:53,694
nuclear bombs on the roof.
It's going to make the thing make an 

2871
02:06:56,191 --> 02:06:58,820
atmosphere too many.
Matt damon.

2872
02:06:58,821 --> 02:06:59,654
I alWays.
What I always just think about that is 

2873
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:04,440
know they get the equation wrong and 
then some like,

2874
02:07:04,441 --> 02:07:05,630
oh fuck it.
It throws the,

2875
02:07:05,710 --> 02:07:06,543
you know,
the gravitational pull off by four 

2876
02:07:08,311 --> 02:07:09,780
centimeters,
which you and then you're like,

2877
02:07:10,110 --> 02:07:11,040
oh shit.
Yeah,

2878
02:07:11,120 --> 02:07:13,060
yeah.
That should have been a carry the two.

2879
02:07:14,180 --> 02:07:16,410
And then aliens land on it and take it 
over.

2880
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:17,273
As soon as the air comes up.
Those like the actual alien from the 

2881
02:07:21,091 --> 02:07:23,430
movie alien with the big fucking head.
Those things,

2882
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:27,030
they just camp out right over there and 
start building spaceships and plan their

2883
02:07:27,031 --> 02:07:29,070
attack problems.
Shane smith,

2884
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:32,370
I don't know if we're gonna solve them 
by moving them or do you see that?

2885
02:07:32,371 --> 02:07:35,070
Uh,
thAt the last movie,

2886
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:36,370
they're a rival?

2887
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:36,941
Yeah.
no,

2888
02:07:36,941 --> 02:07:37,900
I didn't.
I liked it.

2889
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:39,370
I heard it was great.
I liked it.

2890
02:07:39,550 --> 02:07:40,930
I heard it was really good.
I haven't seen it yet.

2891
02:07:40,990 --> 02:07:42,130
I'm going to see it though.
I liked it.

2892
02:07:42,131 --> 02:07:43,540
I thought it was good.
Don't you spoil her?

2893
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:44,433
okay.
I'm not gonna.

2894
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:45,730
I know you wanted to.
Right?

2895
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:47,200
I gotta go man.
Get outta here,

2896
02:07:47,201 --> 02:07:49,050
man.
I love this fun.

2897
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:50,623
Always.
Always,

2898
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:51,800
always.
We did a sober one,

2899
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:55,370
said we couldn't do it.
I'll come back a midseason and I'll.

2900
02:07:55,371 --> 02:07:57,970
I'll be on the piss again.
Oh,

2901
02:07:57,971 --> 02:07:58,804
jesus.
I'm hoping that mayo gives me a clean 

2902
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:03,790
bill so that I can come back.
You'll look great.

2903
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:04,960
I'm sure you're fine.
clever.

2904
02:08:05,010 --> 02:08:05,681
Amazing.
Gentlemen,

2905
02:08:05,681 --> 02:08:10,681
I love you to.
Shane smith was great.
