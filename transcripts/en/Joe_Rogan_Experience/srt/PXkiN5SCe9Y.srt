1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:04,861
Boom,

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:09,861
and we're live with my pal Vinny shoreman
an eight time world Moy Thai champion.

3
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:10,704
Liam Harrison.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,520
Ah Fuck.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:11,821
Fuck.

6
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:12,031
Yeah,

7
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:12,420
Dude.

8
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,080
Great to be here.

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,310
Great to see a little bit.

10
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,510
Um,

11
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:15,961
listen man,

12
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:16,201
I'm a,

13
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:18,030
I'm a big fan of all combat sports,

14
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:20,970
but I really believe that if there's
one sport that doesn't get its due,

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,833
it's Moitai.

16
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,140
I really don't understand why
it hasn't taken off in America.

17
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,280
I don't get it.

18
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,570
I love boxing.

19
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:28,620
Boxing's a lot of fun.

20
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,480
I think moy ties twice as fun.

21
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,171
Yeah,

22
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:32,670
it's twice as odd as well I think,

23
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:36,420
I mean not fault pro box in and
have an over under Muay Thai fight.

24
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,800
It's definitely a lot harder.

25
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,430
I mean he's getting more mainstream now
along with the MMA because most of the

26
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,290
top of Murphy is,

27
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,860
are doing Muay Thai for the standup,

28
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,730
but it's still not where
it needs to be annoying.

29
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,040
Yeah,

30
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,611
it's weird,

31
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:48,360
right?

32
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,571
Yeah.

33
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:53,520
I mean I think what puts a lot
of people off my tie is the uh,

34
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,080
maybe the two minute break and also
the two minute break in between rounds,

35
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,540
traditional music and stuff like that.

36
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,340
People find the arts or take two ready,

37
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:03,174
which is,

38
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,850
I mean I love it so I
don't see that problem,

39
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:07,860
but I can see outside
the box for that as well.

40
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:11,070
So I feel like the two minute break
gives guys more of a chance to recover,

41
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,660
which makes the fights more exciting.

42
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:16,590
You have more energy and I
don't care about the dance.

43
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:17,310
The why crew,

44
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,143
that doesn't bother me.

45
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,140
If you got a finite in martial arts
funding me to sit down to where I am.

46
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:22,060
But once baseball,

47
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,730
baseball is so fucking,

48
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,583
exactly.

49
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,400
It's crazy how boring it is.

50
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,700
A lot shorter than England now
they started to cut out the,

51
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:29,640
all the traditional stuff.

52
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,610
There's no runway to know why crew
did you get in the ring you face off,

53
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,920
bell goes go straight away.

54
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,080
So trying to cook little aspects of
it out just to make it more media fun,

55
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,630
friendly.

56
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,110
Really.

57
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,390
We should probably explain to people
that don't know what we're talking about

58
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:42,680
though.

59
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:42,960
The,

60
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,220
the dance that they do,

61
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,150
it's called the white crew.

62
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:45,984
Right.

63
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,640
And what's,

64
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,380
what does the headband they put on?

65
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:50,370
What does the Mong Kong,

66
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,970
that's the Mong Kong and
when you're doing the dance,

67
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:55,440
the is like to warm up.

68
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,071
Yeah.

69
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:56,341
This,

70
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,660
there's lots of different rate,

71
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,580
lots of different reasons why these
different counts believe different things

72
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:04,180
and study mainly to do with bodies and
you see it in the ring and then take in,

73
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,103
uh,

74
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,570
play in respect to your gym.

75
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,250
Yeah.

76
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,700
You'd coaches your parents,

77
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:09,534
et cetera in Atlanta.

78
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:09,871
Yeah.

79
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,310
I mean I enjoy doing it.

80
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,640
Eight,

81
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,910
eight tall prepares me mentally
for what's about to happen.

82
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,960
Um,

83
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,440
I've done it nearly all my own roommate
fights only the odd one or two where

84
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:21,960
I've missed it when that's wanting to
be in because I've been told by the

85
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:22,411
promoters,

86
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:22,800
right,

87
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,610
no runway,

88
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,361
I enjoy doing it.

89
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,051
But like Vinny said,

90
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,150
like some people will come watch it.

91
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:27,030
They just want to see fights.

92
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,430
They don't want to see the
aspect of the sport as well.

93
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:31,140
They just want to see
people getting torn up.

94
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,500
And in case anybody didn't catch
that through that dance accent,

95
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,870
he just said 108 fights.

96
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,490
That's fucking crazy,

97
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,030
man.

98
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,820
That's a lot of fun.

99
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,230
It is.

100
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,921
For a Westerner,

101
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:42,930
but a lot of the ties I'm coming across,

102
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,180
they're all 200 300 plus.

103
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,420
I remember last year
I fought a tie and um,

104
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,100
they said all Liam's at a hundred fights.

105
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,210
That is a lot.

106
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,811
What do you think?

107
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:52,380
And he said,

108
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,300
I'd hundred fights when I was 15 years old

109
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,000
and I was sick down.

110
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,811
Who said that about it?

111
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,970
So a hundred fights and he's,

112
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,250
how's it even possible?

113
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,113
I'm not sure.

114
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,480
It must be every week,

115
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,120
52 weeks a year.

116
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,141
He said live in,

117
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:05,471
isn't it?

118
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:07,180
So if they don't eat,

119
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:07,511
they don't.

120
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:08,344
If it ends Ireland,

121
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,281
if you don't fight it,

122
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:09,790
don't eat.

123
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,623
So see ya.

124
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,160
There's nowhere welfare
or anything like that.

125
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:16,480
So the half the day that I had a former
UFC champion pat Miletich in yesterday

126
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,960
and we were talking about more Thai
and how crazy it is that this one place

127
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,490
Thailand developed this
completely effective style.

128
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,650
Like they changed the way people fight.

129
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,910
I mean they really did.

130
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,110
Yeah.

131
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,500
Did you look at all
the other martial arts,

132
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,930
whether it's karate or
Kung Fu or anything else?

133
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:33,400
Like they figured it out.

134
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,060
Yeah.

135
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,650
Without doubt.

136
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,230
Um,

137
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,620
but what's happening now is as well the
westerners are starting to catch them up

138
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:38,890
now.

139
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,100
I mean,

140
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,930
remember the first time
I went to Thailand,

141
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,470
not many people will go in and not many
people knew about fighting that tie

142
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:47,290
where more a more Western is
now we're going to live there.

143
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,940
The stay in there for
long periods of time.

144
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,920
The getting it down and we,

145
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:52,750
I can compete with the top level ties now.

146
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,410
Wow.

147
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,020
If all that back in the day or they
might have been like only Ramon Decker,

148
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,321
Danny,

149
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:56,950
Bill,

150
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,701
obviously John,

151
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,310
we empowered them guys will be running.

152
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,350
But now there's a lot,

153
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,130
a lot,

154
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,000
especially around Europe,

155
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:04,781
French fighters,

156
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:06,460
top level British guys.

157
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,570
We've got Daniel McGowan and England.

158
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:08,080
He's doing it.

159
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,200
I mean we are starting to really compete
with people on top of the top level.

160
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,410
Now is more time,

161
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,500
more popular in Europe
than it is in America?

162
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,370
Yeah,

163
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,380
there's massive shows on
in Europe every weekend.

164
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,470
I mean in America there's like
the main ones laying fight.

165
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,080
Um,

166
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,460
yeah,

167
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,940
we've got like two or three
huge promotions in England now.

168
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,863
Jaco,

169
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,353
there's tiger,

170
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,451
the French,

171
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:31,300
they have massive shows
on every weekend with top,

172
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:32,440
top level fighters on,

173
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,383
um,

174
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,610
all over Poland and every,

175
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:35,620
everywhere he's getting it.

176
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:36,430
He's getting huge.

177
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,870
I'm a big fan of lion fight,

178
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:41,890
but it seems to me that there's a lot
of times where these guys come over and

179
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:44,710
they're fighting someone that really
doesn't belong in there with them and you

180
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:47,350
get to see like alert Zillow or something
like that that would be absolutely

181
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,184
ridiculous.

182
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,230
Fight against the guy was at 405,

183
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:54,670
so one of the best Thai champions of
this era and his first ever professional

184
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,310
more to look going back,

185
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,690
ripped off Jaco and everything else.

186
00:04:58,691 --> 00:04:59,524
You know,

187
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,780
you do it in such a way
that the matchmaking Brian
called ridges or matchmaking

188
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:08,140
our friend if I saw like rarely read,

189
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,890
always,

190
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,150
always competitive,

191
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,470
which I really enjoy.

192
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,510
And you've been doing commentary
for them for how long?

193
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,380
I've been Dean Kamen.

194
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,950
She fall y'all cows
since 2011 I met Stefan.

195
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,190
Yeah.

196
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,460
And,

197
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,060
uh,

198
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,150
when I was working for at showtime
and she asked me to work for them,

199
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,040
I still have some of the old,

200
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,600
it's showtime on my old,

201
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,860
I have a Dvr and my gym that's like
fucking 10 years old and I still have your

202
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:30,370
voice.

203
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:30,840
Right?

204
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,673
Yeah.

205
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,001
That's great.

206
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:34,160
Yeah.

207
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,880
You know what,

208
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,410
as I've,

209
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:35,830
as I've,

210
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,120
I was going to say as I've matured,

211
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:41,770
but after the shenanigans we've got
up to in the past you'd be surprised.

212
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:42,130
But you know,

213
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,120
it's eight sad,

214
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:43,991
you know,

215
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:46,120
y'all cows going from strength
to strength and you know,

216
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:51,121
and it showtime off shoots like
glory and [inaudible] work far now,

217
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,340
you know,

218
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,220
it's so healthy at the minute.

219
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,040
So healthy kickboxing
and Muay Thai as well.

220
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,190
So high level,

221
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,240
it's just to me,

222
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:03,620
I mean I've sat down and thought about
this alone by myself for hours on end.

223
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,200
Trying to think like what would
be the way to get more time,

224
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,460
more popular in America.

225
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,850
Cause me as a,

226
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,090
a person who loves combat sports,

227
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,920
I look at my time and I'm like,

228
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:14,750
this is the pinnacle of striking sports.

229
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:15,980
It's the most exciting to me.

230
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:16,910
I liked the clinch.

231
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,841
I liked the elbows.

232
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:18,770
I love kickboxing.

233
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:19,604
I Love Glory,

234
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,680
but I feel like there's
something missing with that.

235
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,030
Like just the stuff that you were showing
me today with all the trips and the

236
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:28,220
sweeps and all that stuff
that's eliminated from glory.

237
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,370
The thing is that gives me it Liam as
well though because he's got such a,

238
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,720
it's got a friend family style,

239
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,261
you know,

240
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:34,500
he's not particularly a clincher,

241
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,630
but it is crushed bang,

242
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:37,370
wallop and 150 mile an hour.

243
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:39,200
And I mean I'm not gonna lie,

244
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,370
I'm his biggest fan.

245
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,990
I mean if he listened
to the common traits,

246
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,490
totally 100% biased and I fucking cash.

247
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,881
You know what I mean?

248
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,910
I've known him since
we 15:00 AM on monarch.

249
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,470
Got flaws,

250
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:49,820
but he's like,

251
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,020
look how well he's laying down

252
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,830
this mash unit.

253
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,040
But you know for me a AC
style that makes it exciting.

254
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,580
Well the TV thing,

255
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,690
I think it's getting more popular.

256
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:05,070
Need to pick and choose what
fights you put it on the TV off.

257
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,220
If you just put like a random show on,

258
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:09,350
we've like free like
fights that are terrible,

259
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:09,681
but ones,

260
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:10,490
okay,

261
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,091
you need to,

262
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,150
instead of it being alive,

263
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,090
maybe like pick and
choose some good fights.

264
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:14,661
Get out there.

265
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:16,490
Get people talking about Michael Vick.

266
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,791
Wow.

267
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,411
Did you see that?

268
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:18,191
They see them elbows,

269
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:19,024
see all that blood,

270
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,090
see them sweeps.

271
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,871
That's what I feel.

272
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:21,150
Yeah,

273
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,660
that's what I,

274
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,610
that's what I do personally,

275
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:27,611
but I feel like if a network like Fox
took a chance and had one Saturday night

276
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:32,270
and they promoted it and then we're going
to show you the most dangerous standup

277
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:33,470
strikers on the planet earth.

278
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,160
Like you might think that professional
boxers are the most dangerous strikers,

279
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,080
but they literally
wouldn't last two rounds.

280
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,880
They'd get the legs kicked
out from under them.

281
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,920
They'd get kneed in the body
and elbowed in the face.

282
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,260
They'd get cut up and clenched
and thrown to the ground.

283
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,620
It's just a better style of fighting and
a guy like you CV would be a whole lot

284
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,070
of fun.

285
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,450
I'm a big fan of the way you fight,

286
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:53,751
man.

287
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:54,110
You've,

288
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,640
you fight like you've got rabies.

289
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,543
It's like,

290
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,443
well,

291
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,210
I've always had that,

292
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,190
that type of style.

293
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:02,420
But you know what,

294
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:05,690
sometimes I've probably lost
fires on points because of going,

295
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:08,420
wanting to go for the kill when
probably I had to change my game plan.

296
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,051
I probably could have won,

297
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:10,280
but that's just not what I'm about.

298
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,270
I get in there,

299
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,820
people coming to watch me fight and
paying their hard earned money to come and

300
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:15,540
watch me fight the Onesie,

301
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,670
me smash someone's leg,

302
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:17,810
don't want to see me knock someone out.

303
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:18,644
They want to see,

304
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,610
even if it goes the distance and want to
see me pour it all in there and people

305
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:23,540
are paying their money for that.

306
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,840
So I feel like I've got
a moral obligation to,

307
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,723
to give them that.

308
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,021
I mean,

309
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,280
I can fight technical as well.

310
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:32,150
I've had lots of fights in the past where
I've just gone in with that game set

311
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,760
and I've won schooled
to top level fighters.

312
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,013
Um,

313
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,700
but I don't like doing that.

314
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,750
I want to get in there and I want to,

315
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,584
I want to,

316
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,540
yeah,

317
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,760
I don't like you doing that either.

318
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,541
I'm not going to be,

319
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,260
you know,

320
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,670
you don't like what he fights technical.

321
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:45,923
Listen,

322
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,970
we can't do any wrong in my eyes.

323
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,890
You know what I mean?

324
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,350
You can't,

325
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,531
you know,

326
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:49,741
I mean,

327
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:49,900
I'll,

328
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,780
Liam Liam's killed a family for nothing.

329
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,070
They must've done something.

330
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:54,601
But,

331
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,080
um,

332
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,321
no,

333
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:55,501
I,

334
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,334
I just,

335
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,061
I just think that,

336
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:57,421
you know,

337
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:00,340
he style the way that
the show that we work,

338
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,470
I work on regularly.

339
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:02,040
Y'all come,

340
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,300
I mean to,

341
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,850
to,

342
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,860
to have that level of ease matchmaking.

343
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,340
See in which I was like anything,

344
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,420
if it's done well,

345
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:09,961
it's beautiful.

346
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:10,591
It was done badly.

347
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,060
It's not,

348
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,893
it's

349
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,260
one of the reasons why we were talking
about the Gennady Golovkin and Canelo

350
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,800
Alvarez fine.

351
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:16,951
I mean,

352
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:18,870
one of the reasons why we're so
looking forward to the fight,

353
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,780
not just because the first fight was so
great because stylistically you look at

354
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:22,830
the way those two guys fight.

355
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,110
Like how could this be a
bad fight and some possible,

356
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,560
okay.

357
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,050
And now the buffalo and the good of both
change different cam plans and stuff

358
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,100
and he's got everyone thinking again,

359
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:29,240
oh,

360
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,551
well what?

361
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:30,480
He's going to happen this time.

362
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,890
There's no change.

363
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,860
Someone's going to get hit and
it's going to be guns blazing.

364
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,030
G,

365
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,310
G.

366
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,310
G.

367
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,310
G.

368
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,330
G.

369
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,930
We've been to haunt him and we were
looking for him over there at big bear.

370
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,201
Yeah,

371
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:41,170
you guys went stock

372
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,250
side restaurant where he is,

373
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,260
where he came out and said,

374
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,850
what would you like about,

375
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,180
oh look what he has police.

376
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,023
Yes.

377
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,520
And when we was in there,

378
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:51,250
we were sat there and,

379
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:51,460
and,

380
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,070
and Liam.

381
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,480
Liam was like across from me and I went,

382
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,460
there's Tom Loeffler and he went,

383
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:57,470
he was Gtt,

384
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,360
his manager and then we get
an old chairs out and stuff.

385
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,370
Sat in these chairs out for an Ifr.

386
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,820
Here's good arrive,

387
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,210
he's [inaudible],

388
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,083
he's going to be here.

389
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,880
And we were sat that phrase,

390
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,540
it didn't turn out well.

391
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:16,310
He met Freddy Roach today before
Freddie Roach is a swat guy.

392
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,940
He's a real sweetheart.

393
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:18,940
And he took us down,

394
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,820
let us watch sparring and
stuff and we were like,

395
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,080
yeah,

396
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,330
he won't even though he's like
stood with his flat half an hour.

397
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,360
We were talking about boxing,

398
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,810
he were like interested in when I
were fighting and stuff like that.

399
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,890
He didn't have to be like,

400
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,461
do you know what I mean?

401
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,050
And I bet he gets people walking in there
all the time like wanting to meet him

402
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:32,730
and stuff.

403
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,430
But he took time out and talking to
Vince about all different other types of

404
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:35,731
fights.

405
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:39,660
Let us watch the some top level fight
a spa and he was like really interested

406
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:41,130
like absolute legend.

407
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,120
He's very genuine.

408
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,480
I got to interview him back when he was
training George Saint Pierre when George

409
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,960
St Pierre was a under him and he's
just as down to earth as you are.

410
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:50,580
You are any and you know just regular guy.

411
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:50,881
Yeah,

412
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:51,714
he's a good guy man.

413
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,620
I mean to me and men talk about a guy
who's been around the world and seeing it

414
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,000
all that guy,

415
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,470
you know,

416
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,960
training pack Yao and fuck man.

417
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,290
You know what I thought he said
something about I don't have a package.

418
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:06,000
I was going to train with him for this
fight and he kind of likes and he was so

419
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,790
engaging and endearing about park.

420
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:08,941
Yeah.

421
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:09,501
Wasn't he saying,

422
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:09,601
oh,

423
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:10,830
pack [inaudible] plays basketball.

424
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,280
Even though he's been with him
16 years and he's just gone.

425
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:16,310
Oh well if he goes and does
something that's already fans of,

426
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:16,860
he was like,

427
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:16,951
oh,

428
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,240
well last basket.

429
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:20,160
It's just that they don't give a fuck.

430
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:20,910
He's got money.

431
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,743
He doesn't give a shit.

432
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,540
And you know,

433
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:22,831
I mean,

434
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:25,530
his health has been such an
issue over the last few years.

435
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,330
He has trauma related Parkinson's,

436
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,020
which has got to be very interesting
when you're training fighters and you

437
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,780
realize like you're suffering
from fighting yourself.

438
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,683
Yeah,

439
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,510
just me and him that that's med.

440
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:38,790
My whole trip meeting him and just
seeing are grounded and down to Earth.

441
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,340
He is.

442
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:39,900
Honestly,

443
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,800
I just couldn't believe it.

444
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,270
Have you gotten a wildcard Jim yet?

445
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,661
Yeah.

446
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,050
That's great.

447
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,883
That's where we

448
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,863
watched them.

449
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,131
What worries them?

450
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:51,120
George Combos or junior at age 14 at all.

451
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,640
Oh yeah.

452
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,473
Oh yeah.

453
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,840
Yeah.

454
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,000
Big Flow from Australia.

455
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,540
Definitely.

456
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,231
It's crazy too.

457
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:57,100
When you go up to that Jim,

458
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,060
you hear so much about it.

459
00:11:58,061 --> 00:11:58,391
You're like,

460
00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:58,690
yeah,

461
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,740
it's about as big as this room.

462
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,011
Yeah,

463
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:00,490
it's true.

464
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,960
It's not a big fucking Jim.

465
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:03,090
He was sweating it all sorts.

466
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:03,924
Where are we on the way up?

467
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,810
Yeah,

468
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,111
no,

469
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:05,370
it's,

470
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,640
it's a legendary spot,

471
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,493
you know,

472
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,570
so your in America doing some seminars.

473
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,120
Yeah.

474
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,650
Yeah.

475
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,100
Um,

476
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,640
uh,

477
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,560
fire fury focused seminars.

478
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,940
Vinnie's doing all his um,

479
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,230
NLP mind coaching stuff
for an hour and a half.

480
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:22,240
And then I take over and do
all the physical aspects,

481
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:22,900
um,

482
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,840
Moitai all the little tricks and sweep
some of this stuff that I was sewing,

483
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:28,900
showing you their stuff that I've used
throughout my career to help me get to

484
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:29,590
where I'm,

485
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,910
where I am in NLP.

486
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:33,070
Is Neuro linguistic
linguistic programming,

487
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:34,700
is that what you're doing it,

488
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,190
but it's mainly to language and things.

489
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,020
Tricks that I've picked
up from over the years.

490
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,873
Not all NLP,

491
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,770
a little bit of hypnosis,

492
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:42,521
hypnotic language,

493
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:42,671
blah,

494
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:42,791
blah,

495
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,560
blah.

496
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,050
Right.

497
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,370
And it gets them into learning state.

498
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:48,460
So what I do is I get a prepared
them in a learning state,

499
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:49,480
give them confidence,

500
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:53,140
build them up so they can start
to take on what Liam teachers.

501
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,220
So they said double whammy.

502
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:54,521
Really.

503
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,740
So he teaches some brilliant
techniques as you are aware.

504
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,070
And then I just do my bit to get
them where they have to get to.

505
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,001
Before I met you,

506
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:03,100
I thought that hypnosis was for idiots.

507
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,000
I thought you'd have to be a dummy.

508
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,860
Am I gay?

509
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,190
Ain't getting me with that shit.

510
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,600
It's him.

511
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:10,960
He said,

512
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,100
and then when you hit with ties me,

513
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:12,521
I was like,

514
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:13,630
wait a minute,

515
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:14,710
this is real.

516
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,670
Wow.

517
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,503
But it's,

518
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,040
I tried to explain it to me.

519
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,030
Oh to people,

520
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,241
you know.

521
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:19,541
I'm like,

522
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,760
it's not what you think.

523
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,500
It's not like you don't
know where you are,

524
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,910
you don't know what's going on.

525
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,080
All of a sudden your parents are off.

526
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,310
It's not like that.

527
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:32,080
It's like you achieve this weird
state of mind that you're aware of it.

528
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,720
Yes I do is guide you to it.

529
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,800
And then the client does it like
whether I do it with year well actors.

530
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,900
We've got an actor friend
called Mike Parr it,

531
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:41,080
we've,

532
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,913
I've been working with.

533
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,940
He loves it and white and Brown
people it now to help his acting.

534
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:46,900
He did,

535
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,450
he mentioned me on a
program called this morning,

536
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:51,520
which is a daytime show in England.

537
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,443
And uh,

538
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,600
he went on in a soap
opera called Emma Dale.

539
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,710
He's normally in a long time and no
need less time because I'm not the your

540
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,700
biggest fan by the way,

541
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,130
say Mike Medis year.

542
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,131
So yeah.

543
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:09,580
And we have done work with him
and since of going on your show,

544
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:10,120
which I have to,

545
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,120
I really do appreciate it because my
work's gone from a businesswoman of the

546
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,100
year CEOs and everyone now been,

547
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:18,671
it's just been,

548
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:22,390
it's just gotten crazy because they
needed to convince her and he was at so

549
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:23,224
thanks very much.

550
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,621
Well,

551
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:24,340
it's legit.

552
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,210
I'll tell you right now.

553
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:25,451
I mean,

554
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:26,380
I don't know about other people,

555
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:27,310
but you know how to do it.

556
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,230
Thank you again.

557
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,390
It,

558
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,980
it gave me some very interesting
understanding about the mind and thought

559
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:37,120
processes and how it works
and that expression that
you look like to use all the

560
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:37,340
time.

561
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,250
Hakalau allow,

562
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,610
I think about that.

563
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:40,870
Explain what that is to people.

564
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,780
I can always,

565
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,610
uh,

566
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,870
increasing your peripheral vision.

567
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:44,770
Um,

568
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,370
it's correct.

569
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,550
It's increasing your awareness just
by basically cutting off your chest or

570
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:49,780
chatter that goes on in your mind.

571
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,440
If you see a Liam when he
fights before he fights,

572
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,240
he pushes his gloves together and
Dawson's Zaha cloud is every single time.

573
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:01,290
What that does when I
am showing you that yet,

574
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,320
I will show you later on if you wish,

575
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,060
is you anchored the gloves.

576
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,410
So you anchor a positive state in the
gloves and you push them together and then

577
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,150
you find Hakalau and
it just gets you in a,

578
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:11,840
well,

579
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,680
you can explain it.

580
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,280
What's unique about these seminars is
I wanted to do with me is because I've

581
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:18,830
worked with miss up before and all
this stuff that he's teaching and not,

582
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:19,890
I know it works myself.

583
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:20,870
Um,

584
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,600
first time I use Vinny is a,

585
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,080
the story are we all started,

586
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,850
I thought a top level ty called,

587
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:28,790
I don't want Carl summary
in nickname was [inaudible].

588
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,960
You had like an 8% Kayla ratio and
I went to fight him in Jamaica.

589
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,250
I knew I could be in,

590
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:36,740
but there are a few aspects that you
think or I would train and it didn't go

591
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:37,574
right at the time.

592
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,450
Threw him off.

593
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:40,811
I say,

594
00:15:40,811 --> 00:15:41,460
look,

595
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,150
I'm not a liar.

596
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,600
Really?

597
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,433
Fuck my shit up.

598
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,900
It fucked you up on Michael Jackson died.

599
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,650
Oh yeah.

600
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,483
Massive,

601
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,043
massive fun.

602
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,080
Not about blaming Michael Jackson.

603
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,531
Massive.

604
00:15:58,531 --> 00:15:59,031
Michael Jackson.

605
00:15:59,031 --> 00:15:59,401
Massive.

606
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:00,100
Massive.

607
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,230
Did you ever come out to his fights?

608
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:01,680
You have no way.

609
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,610
Smooth criminal,

610
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,450
but yes.

611
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,400
I fought this Thai champion in Jamaica.

612
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,040
Like I said,

613
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,630
a few things didn't go right
and he smashed me to pieces.

614
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:13,920
It was the first time I ever got stopped.

615
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,230
I knew I could beat him.

616
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:16,331
No,

617
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:17,450
I'm good at reading fighters.

618
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,480
I knew I could beat him.

619
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:21,720
So I begged and begged and begged for
the rematch and promote Bri about six,

620
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,651
seven months later,

621
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:23,484
brought him to England.

622
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,553
Men Arena,

623
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,471
massive show,

624
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:29,080
big showed the country devacy and
Vinny had spots maybe far in the past,

625
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:30,570
said you don't ever want
to do a little bit of work.

626
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,091
I know it's fine.

627
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:34,590
I'm mentally strong and mentally strong
and I don't need to do to build up to

628
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:35,400
that fight for,

629
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,180
you know what I'm going to train is out
of the August as I've ever done before

630
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:39,481
anywhere.

631
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:40,140
But there's no point.

632
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,090
You can never be too prepared
because they'd all been in.

633
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:42,930
Can we do a little bit?

634
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,160
And um,

635
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,641
we did,

636
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:45,120
uh,

637
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,180
we did lots of different techniques and
we have like keywords like warrior one

638
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,331
of,

639
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:49,800
um,

640
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,450
the worry was the main one here.

641
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,280
Bear in mind.

642
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,461
Now,

643
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:56,520
the reason why I lean was
reluctant to work with me.

644
00:16:56,521 --> 00:17:01,521
It's the first time he met me and
I stole a wheelchair Strunk steel

645
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,070
chapters for everyone.

646
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,083
Fucking Brits.

647
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,980
I was drunk at a show,

648
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:08,880
at least sound all,

649
00:17:08,881 --> 00:17:11,070
I'm sure these cult Richard
Smith or members or Lisa.

650
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:11,671
And,

651
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:12,350
um,

652
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:12,810
anyway,

653
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,190
so it was a reluctant
because I like to mess about,

654
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,441
you know,

655
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:17,850
I like to be silly,

656
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:18,331
et Cetera,

657
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:19,164
you know.

658
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,370
But he came to me and,

659
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,713
and uh,

660
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,920
we worked together and my take on this
story is I was common sane at the time.

661
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,340
We did great guy called Rob
Cox who lives in San Louis,

662
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,880
who knows everything about weight.

663
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:31,830
I rub cocktails,

664
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,700
every food,

665
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,451
everyone eats the gut,

666
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:36,480
the kink simple and it was
calm and sit me meet him.

667
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,870
Now Liam came to me and I wanted
to put a word in that would,

668
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,461
that,

669
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:41,820
would that keep him strong?

670
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:42,670
So it was warrior.

671
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,250
Now what was really weird
is I was commentating on it.

672
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,700
You can watch it on Youtube when
I'm compensating on the fight.

673
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,010
He looks me at round four

674
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,890
cause I can see him and
he looks through his coat.

675
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:56,190
He's trained to Richard Smith and Andy
House and he's caused a news or five time

676
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:56,941
world champion as well.

677
00:17:56,941 --> 00:18:00,570
So it's in a family and he looks
over at me and he goes warrior.

678
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,280
He looked straight in my eyes.

679
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:02,730
I do.

680
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:03,750
I remember doing that either.

681
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,913
They were like the,

682
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,050
the state I was in my,

683
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:06,884
no Phi in,

684
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,000
it couldn't hurt me.

685
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,030
Bearing in mind our bodily smashed
me a piece in the first fight.

686
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,190
I didn't get her with anything.

687
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:14,890
I would just be like her
in some totals there.

688
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:15,920
I was so on point,

689
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,620
I'll make any mess up our school.

690
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:19,850
Them rarely I'll beat him
pretty convincingly on points.

691
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:20,570
That's amazing.

692
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,403
And um,

693
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,530
I went to the after party
afterwards I'd bottle of water,

694
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,641
sat down,

695
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:26,151
passed out,

696
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:27,050
collapsed ambulance,

697
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:27,860
came and got me,

698
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,131
took me,

699
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:30,110
it was bill had a really bad concussion.

700
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,070
Wow.

701
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,080
But did you cause at the state I was in,

702
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,240
in the fight and um,

703
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,380
I didn't feel a thing.

704
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,940
Everything just my eyes
didn't fail and if it were,

705
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:40,390
we're like,

706
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,223
it's absolutely

707
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,530
so emotionally invested in it as well.

708
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,381
But when he kids,

709
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:44,581
you know,

710
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,414
on those biggest fan,

711
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,320
when he came over he said,

712
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:46,741
thank you.

713
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:47,574
I was like

714
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,860
[inaudible] birthday that day as well.

715
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:50,694
So there are a lot,

716
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,720
I know we started

717
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,400
and I was so overwhelmed by it,

718
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:55,940
but look,

719
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,800
I mean it's only one aspect of it.

720
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,710
He's got a fantastic coach in
Richard Smith and Lisa Hall,

721
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,611
Lisa Smith,

722
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:01,940
Lisa,

723
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,120
you should we call hot Lisa
and all the gangs like Jordan,

724
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:05,930
bad chair,

725
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,370
you know,

726
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,390
and everyone,

727
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,131
Steve Campbell,

728
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:08,940
he stone for condition.

729
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,400
He's got so many people around him.

730
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,630
I'm just one little bit,

731
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,390
but it was weird because he went,

732
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:14,430
he went worrier and I said to him,

733
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:15,340
do you remember saying you went?

734
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,830
No,

735
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,290
she had that.

736
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:16,800
I didn't remember.

737
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,030
I'll have to look back at the
video and watch the concussion.

738
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:21,020
Probably had a lot to do with it.

739
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,180
Maybe I'll look back at the video
and is a left doc in round farm.

740
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:25,014
I had nearly like,

741
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,700
Ooh,

742
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,650
spins around and turns
the wind up probably.

743
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:27,950
Yeah.

744
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,550
Yeah.

745
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:28,821
You know,

746
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:31,850
it's interesting that that's
catching on mental coaching.

747
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:32,871
It really is.

748
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:36,230
And there's a lot of fighters that used
to dismiss it that I know now are using

749
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:36,921
mental coaches.

750
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:40,400
I've had conversations with them
before in the past and I was like,

751
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:41,780
what do you think about
sports psychologist?

752
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,480
When you think about mentors,

753
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,313
I don't need that shit.

754
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,350
And then years later,

755
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:45,651
oh,

756
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,910
loss or two later their minds in a
weird place and then they decide,

757
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,391
okay,

758
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:53,300
I need something like
that I think is I think

759
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,170
wouldn't lost in the changing rooms.

760
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,030
I think that in the
locker room as you say,

761
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,020
you know,

762
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,621
one little,

763
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:00,720
it's like a little tiny bit of anthrax.

764
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:02,850
It thrown in in a reservoir of poison,

765
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,630
a whole say.

766
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,351
And I think that's what it does.

767
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:04,760
Men play.

768
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,110
I've seen fires in the dressing room who
I've trained with in the gym and they

769
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:11,170
have been so strong at
so much power in the gym.

770
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:12,070
They've been the best ever.

771
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:15,010
And I've seen him in the changing
rooms and I've seen him start to go out

772
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,140
yourself going to be at of in it.

773
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,690
It's strong in money and I can see,

774
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:24,220
I'm just trying to deflect change and a
lot of fighters do have that problem and

775
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:25,054
um,

776
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,160
served by the moment.

777
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,530
Yeah.

778
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,270
Yeah.

779
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,040
That's a common thing with everything,

780
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,290
with any kind of performance,

781
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:35,130
anything where you're doing something
that's difficult but fighting it has such

782
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:40,131
dire physical consequences that the
overwhelming anxiety and the pressure just

783
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,340
you,

784
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,430
you see it so many times guys
who were really good fighters,

785
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,890
that they have panic attacks in
the dressing room and they just,

786
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,753
they can't handle the

787
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,890
interviews as well.

788
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:50,050
It means guess what,

789
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:50,850
you're uh,

790
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,150
uh,

791
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,070
a diverse mix of clients
that he is everything.

792
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:55,210
It's what it means to you,

793
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:55,571
isn't it?

794
00:20:55,571 --> 00:21:00,010
So that your fight against whoever the
artist fight is tie boxes in the world.

795
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:01,930
Like they keep matching you with and um,

796
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,321
and,

797
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:02,971
and your job,

798
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:06,940
are you your interview or are you like
Mikey that the lines that you have to do

799
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:07,590
while you're showing?

800
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,660
I think it's all relative to you.

801
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,011
You know,

802
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:12,310
when anxiety's a big scourge,

803
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,920
anytime you have to do anything
difficult comes to that.

804
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,660
But it just doesn't come into play
in anything remotely except war.

805
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,850
It's like war is like
the highest level of it.

806
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,430
And then pass you get below.

807
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:28,270
That was like probably police
officers and first responders.

808
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,110
And then it's fighters date and it's like
there's nothing like that that walk to

809
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:33,250
the fucking ring,

810
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,000
you know what I mean?

811
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,800
And you're just thinking
about did I do enough?

812
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:36,941
Did I sleep enough?

813
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:37,774
Did I eat right?

814
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,320
You know?

815
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,970
Yeah.

816
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,370
And it's,

817
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,600
and you see it.

818
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,860
I see so many.

819
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,990
I think that's why I've
kind of got into it as well,

820
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:44,600
you know,

821
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,230
with different things that
I saw so much potential.

822
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:47,910
She,

823
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,250
I,

824
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,083
you know,

825
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,013
the first time,

826
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,220
well the first times I met him I was
training someone to fight him and I was

827
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:54,461
like,

828
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:54,820
right,

829
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,270
listen,

830
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,103
he's only a kid.

831
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:56,921
So what you've got gotta do,

832
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:58,870
get in his face and punch him in the face.

833
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:01,200
Art As often as you can heal suit quit.

834
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,000
How wrong was I?

835
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,680
I wrote 15 who was he?

836
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,680
How old is the other guy?

837
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,510
But at 28 oh Jesus.

838
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,970
Mark has stolen from Liverpool.

839
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:11,570
Yeah.

840
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,250
You find a fucking 28 year
old when you were 15 right.

841
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,190
I find at 65 kilos now.

842
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,660
My first fight,

843
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,480
we're at 60 kilos when I was 14.

844
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,240
So I've always been big for my age and
then when I got to 15 and just stopped

845
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,074
growing.

846
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:24,800
Um,

847
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,840
so when I was 14,

848
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:30,410
I had like a beard and I looked like
a Yeti and also a big in school.

849
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,060
So I'm having a fight older,

850
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,400
a lot older people having
to fight men and um,

851
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,480
so I would like my finger when I 14 when
my first fights without any protection

852
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:39,800
on how to fight 28 year old.

853
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,000
And um,

854
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,350
I went my first 29 pro fights all and
beaten he wanted until the fought a Thai

855
00:22:45,351 --> 00:22:46,970
champion and um,

856
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,200
I got a bit of an IDN call,

857
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:52,090
you call it dwell that I realize all I
have to change up my again plenty here

858
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,650
and have to go to Thailand and like
learn how they are doing it different.

859
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,390
What is the difference when you,

860
00:22:57,391 --> 00:23:01,230
when you train in England versus when
you train in Thailand and how they fight?

861
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,093
What is the difference?

862
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,943
Well over that.

863
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,220
Uh,

864
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,940
I stayed there for about 18 months since
island and I just lived in the gym like

865
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:07,541
the ties did.

866
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,680
So walk up in the morning,

867
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,840
we went running came back pad.

868
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,511
Would it be a clinch?

869
00:23:11,511 --> 00:23:12,760
Not too intense in the morning,

870
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,520
but then the afternoon
session free in the afternoon,

871
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,590
the scorching hot eat free till six.

872
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:18,730
I mean most classes in England,

873
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,151
no matter what,

874
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:20,290
an hour,

875
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:20,710
an hour and a half,

876
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,610
these were free hours.

877
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:22,444
Intense.

878
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,250
You kicked the second workout of the day.

879
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:24,591
Yeah.

880
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:24,761
Yeah.

881
00:23:24,761 --> 00:23:27,340
So you skipped him for half
an hour straight off of that.

882
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:28,061
Straight on the pads.

883
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:28,361
Seven,

884
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:28,900
eight rounds,

885
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,440
straight flat,

886
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
straight and aspiring.

887
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,160
Dreadful.

888
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,540
Straight in a clinch him with the ties
and anyone who knows how strong the ties

889
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:34,680
are.

890
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,513
Clinton as well.

891
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,660
It was absolute torture every single day.

892
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,440
Um,

893
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,030
but I loved it and I don't think without
doing that I would often get to being

894
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:44,080
able to compete with the
top level ties I have done.

895
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,213
Um,

896
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,650
now the arm,

897
00:23:46,651 --> 00:23:48,920
which Richard as projects progressed,

898
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:49,021
we,

899
00:23:49,021 --> 00:23:50,000
my gym in England,

900
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,450
I feel like we've got so many top level
fighters now that the wire at that

901
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:53,781
level,

902
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:55,060
I feel like I don't have to go over there,

903
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,913
do it anymore.

904
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,580
We've got the stable in bad company
now we've got the knowledge,

905
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:02,330
you've got the experience and we've
got the and the house in Jordan Watson,

906
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,040
young Joe Craven coming through.

907
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:07,380
We've got all these strong strong
animals in the gym that am,

908
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,060
we'll probably want to,

909
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,780
well we are,

910
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,240
we have been one at best
engineer for a long time now.

911
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,030
Now do you work out the
same amount of time?

912
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:17,810
Do you do a morning session and then do
a three hour afternoon session to yeah,

913
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:18,830
so what I'll do in the morning,

914
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:22,550
I'll go down and probably to kick pads
with me than my boss Richard and then

915
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,860
maybe a bit of power in
majority than are a run.

916
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,950
So then in the evening I've got
pts all day in between this store.

917
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:29,930
That's the only different
personal trainer.

918
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,540
Yeah.

919
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,320
I teach as well.

920
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,153
Fuck fulltime.

921
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,620
So I might have five hours a
pts to do in between all this.

922
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,020
It's always exhausting.

923
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:37,511
Yeah.

924
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:37,960
Is it,

925
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,080
especially the way you teach?

926
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:39,530
Yeah.

927
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,460
You get very intense.

928
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:40,880
Um,

929
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,820
I like to be hands on and
had to get involved and um,

930
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:44,280
it,

931
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,021
it is tiring.

932
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:45,621
I just have to make sure,

933
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:46,490
let me die at some point.

934
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:47,760
We stopped for that because
if I have a day where I,

935
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,350
where I eat shit and then
I'm exhausted and I'm,

936
00:24:50,351 --> 00:24:52,970
can I get the most out of my second
training session and then I'll get to five

937
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:53,804
o'clock,

938
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,770
I'll go run again.

939
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,720
I kicked pads again and
that's when Richard,

940
00:24:56,721 --> 00:24:57,350
I'll do like,

941
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,700
so your rent twice in a day.

942
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,630
Some days.

943
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,190
Wow.

944
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,070
Adult run father,

945
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:02,630
I'll do my five five k's,

946
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:03,464
but fast.

947
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,700
And the way I see it with Muay Thai,

948
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:05,630
it's explosive stuff.

949
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:06,141
So I do my,

950
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:07,570
I do more hill sprints and more sprints.

951
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:08,930
Works out to a long distance.

952
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,780
The only time I do my
really long distances,

953
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,830
a funny trauma went down drastically.

954
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,610
But we,

955
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,450
when you fight in five,

956
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:15,051
three minute rounds,

957
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:15,840
it's not a long time.

958
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,673
It's like bang,

959
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:16,841
Bang,

960
00:25:16,841 --> 00:25:16,991
Bang,

961
00:25:16,991 --> 00:25:17,630
Bang.

962
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,710
So I do more explosive work like hill
sprints from our strength coach and stuff

963
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:24,230
like that and no plyometric
explosive workouts.

964
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,130
Um,

965
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,870
that's the only thing
that's missing in Thailand,

966
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:28,370
really the strength and conditioning.

967
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,360
But a lot of gyms out there now are
getting hold of that and change it.

968
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,203
Yep.

969
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,140
Robbie,

970
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,790
Tim and Sharon who's trained,

971
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,860
the Alistair Overeem is over there.

972
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,920
Uh,

973
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,700
but uh,

974
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,040
and bad has been there a few times,

975
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:45,810
a lot of the Dutch color in Koh Samui
and that they've got a of crossfit place

976
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:46,470
now.

977
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,420
They've got like a new sort of metaphors.

978
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,520
A lot of them are catching up,

979
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:53,931
you know,

980
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:54,240
and,

981
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,930
and you know,

982
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,010
doing it over there as well.

983
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:57,130
So they kind of catch you up.

984
00:25:57,131 --> 00:25:59,160
I know that Bam Cheer Mackinaw that uh,

985
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,110
well,

986
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,720
cal stock Stradford conditions.

987
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,240
He looks like he does a
lot of it goes opposite.

988
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,083
He's philosophy,

989
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:06,541
um,

990
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,810
against Johnny Risko
when he lost Johnny risk.

991
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:10,050
It was amazing that night.

992
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,190
It was just on him,

993
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,670
didn't give him any respite.

994
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,583
How long ago was this?

995
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,170
Um,

996
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:14,581
about,

997
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:16,230
I want the last week or last week.

998
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,760
How old's book out now?

999
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,810
Maybe five to the twilight now.

1000
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,030
He said let you know I got a chance to
see him fight in La when they had a,

1001
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,300
they've had some fights.

1002
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,480
They tried to do some pay per view
events and stuff like that out here.

1003
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,820
It's just for whatever
reason it never caught on.

1004
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,181
Yeah.

1005
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:35,000
We did time in America and uh,

1006
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:39,060
when I'm before undefault twice on it and
that's how I'm able good shows them as

1007
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:39,894
well.

1008
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,970
Real good fire to wicked child.

1009
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:42,721
That's where I'm at.

1010
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:46,320
Brown lose our friend who's
looked after us here and um,

1011
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:46,951
Fontana,

1012
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:47,761
California in the house.

1013
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:48,110
Yes.

1014
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,040
A double dose.

1015
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,090
That's what our seminar is
on Saturday or last one.

1016
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:51,960
And um,

1017
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,231
yeah,

1018
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:53,064
it was,

1019
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,130
it was a shame because we love it here,

1020
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:56,790
don't we?

1021
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,623
We don't want to go.

1022
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,120
I wish,

1023
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,230
I really wish we could,

1024
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,850
I could figure out a way
to get it to catch on.

1025
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:02,260
I just don't understand what's wrong.

1026
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:02,610
Hey.

1027
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:02,971
Like I said,

1028
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,060
he's getting there with the,

1029
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,090
with the MMA and stuff.

1030
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:09,460
Like I remember the first time I have a
fault man event on a show in England and

1031
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,320
I got like paired like this much,

1032
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,190
but now I'm a headlining shows and
I'm getting paid like they're now.

1033
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,140
So there's a lot of people
are saying going nowhere.

1034
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:17,974
It's going nowhere.

1035
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,150
He's bringing that Mike in front of you.

1036
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:24,040
I've watched it like go from there right
to where it is now in my career and

1037
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,810
where it's come from is massive.

1038
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:29,620
It's massive gap from where it was
and if it does keep going like this,

1039
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:30,880
it will eventually get there.

1040
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:31,960
But he's just slowly,

1041
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:32,321
slowly,

1042
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:33,070
slowly.

1043
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,160
We've always seen much more and more
tight talent come out of England and that

1044
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:37,060
of Europe.

1045
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,220
Then we have out of America
for whatever reason,

1046
00:27:39,221 --> 00:27:41,110
there's been some standout
fighters in America,

1047
00:27:41,111 --> 00:27:43,060
but it's the big shows.

1048
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,940
There's like a lot of big shows in Europe
and that just really never been the

1049
00:27:45,941 --> 00:27:46,690
case here.

1050
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:46,990
Yeah,

1051
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,470
I mean like,

1052
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,730
like Jaco is the one now
everyone wants to fight on Jaco.

1053
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,330
I'm nothing to do with a promotion.

1054
00:27:52,331 --> 00:27:52,551
I'm,

1055
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:55,510
I'm just a young cal fire and I get
people messaging me all the time.

1056
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,160
Oh how do I get to vote on your cow?

1057
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:57,430
Who Do,

1058
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,263
who do I contact?

1059
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:58,801
And I'm on a,

1060
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:02,740
I mean like hundreds of messages all
the time of people asking like everyone

1061
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:02,991
does it.

1062
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:04,780
That's the show that
everyone wants to be honest.

1063
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,930
The biggest outside of the
main stadium ones in Thailand,

1064
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,000
the biggest in the world
by by a country mile.

1065
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,130
Do they do Internet pay per view?

1066
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,441
No they don't.

1067
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,160
And um,

1068
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,890
I think that's something
they should look at the,

1069
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,890
I've said this rage
because I think as as it,

1070
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,870
because even even though it's big,

1071
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:22,530
it's small,

1072
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,260
if that makes sense.

1073
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,710
Even in numbers,

1074
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:26,160
that concert it come to the show.

1075
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,350
So I was like 3000 or something like that,

1076
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:29,310
which isn't massive.

1077
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,750
Bodies always jump at and I think it's
when you're selling tickets for a show,

1078
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:34,410
he would say,

1079
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:34,691
oh look,

1080
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:39,360
come buy it for like a 5.0 and watch
it instead of wearing the national,

1081
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:40,600
there may have been geo block.

1082
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,220
Yeah.

1083
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,590
Geo Block cause another infusion do that.

1084
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,843
I worked for,

1085
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,390
what do you mean that that means that
you can't watch it in your country,

1086
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,760
but everyone else

1087
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:54,330
also that people will go to the to see it.

1088
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,400
So you buy tickets?

1089
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:55,761
Yeah,

1090
00:28:55,761 --> 00:28:55,941
yeah,

1091
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:56,460
yeah.

1092
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,810
So where does it air in?

1093
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,100
Does it air on television?

1094
00:28:59,101 --> 00:28:59,880
Like eight,

1095
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,990
say the deep.

1096
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:01,560
They bring the,

1097
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,610
we do the show and then
they put the fights out and
they kind of feed the fights

1098
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:06,720
are over a youtube.

1099
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,120
I think they may put it on their
Facebook page or that the fight.

1100
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,993
So I'm not sure.

1101
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,100
Every single fight is a war.

1102
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,130
Every single fight could headline any
shore we have go around the world.

1103
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:17,211
We,

1104
00:29:17,211 --> 00:29:17,370
I've

1105
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,720
got some right kids coming through.

1106
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:21,940
I'm a massive funnel or
a boring show is ever,

1107
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,520
and even even when Liam's not on it,

1108
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:24,331
which is uh,

1109
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:24,760
you know,

1110
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,090
it obviously the highlight for me
because to me mate and he brings,

1111
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:27,690
it brings stone.

1112
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:27,991
It doesn't,

1113
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:28,824
he's a storm.

1114
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,910
We've got some new kits coming
through that are just like,

1115
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:35,460
it just mentioned Stuart
Stabler and these gel craven.

1116
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:37,290
And there's these kids
come in through that.

1117
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:41,430
I just watched him take it on his style
and then taken on their own style and

1118
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,040
there's some

1119
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,950
real dangerous kids coming from now.

1120
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,670
I would imagine that with your style,

1121
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,750
it's your style.

1122
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:50,710
So physically intensive and
so aggressive that like your,

1123
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,050
how well do you monitor your diet?

1124
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,453
Um,

1125
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,541
I have to do,

1126
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,201
we've gone,

1127
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:57,160
I'm close to a fight.

1128
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,053
Um,

1129
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,081
if at all.

1130
00:29:59,081 --> 00:29:59,461
Like I said,

1131
00:29:59,461 --> 00:29:59,771
I've got,

1132
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,390
I'm going to have no energy
and we'll cut weight.

1133
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,410
Yeah.

1134
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,880
I used to call it a
lot more than I do now.

1135
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:06,070
I might do about eight pounds now,

1136
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:09,640
but I might start the fight camp
and be on the 10 pounds over.

1137
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,330
Not Nothing.

1138
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:10,720
That's nothing.

1139
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,080
No,

1140
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,321
no,

1141
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:12,154
not long haul.

1142
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,790
Um,

1143
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,220
my last four or five fights the day
before the way and never been on where it

1144
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,770
without getting this song or all blah.

1145
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:19,600
I'm going to go run in the sweat
suit or anything like that.

1146
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,411
As I've got older,

1147
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:21,244
I've got wiser.

1148
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,261
I usually,

1149
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:25,600
I just realized it was draining you too
much because especially as I got older,

1150
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:26,091
when I were younger,

1151
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:26,861
I could get away with it.

1152
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:29,920
I might be getting sauna and lose like
free fall key or the way in and still get

1153
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:32,650
in there and knock someone
out or stop someone.

1154
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,400
But as a,

1155
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,180
I had a few mistakes as I got older as
well growing when I'm missed weight and

1156
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:37,511
like met me,

1157
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:37,871
just think,

1158
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:38,650
what am I doing here?

1159
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,920
Get on point with it because as
soon as you start to do so flat,

1160
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:43,490
promoters don't want to work with you.

1161
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,433
Get a bad rep.

1162
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,011
And I'm this,

1163
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:45,761
we're about seven,

1164
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:46,940
eight years ago now and I had done,

1165
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,370
I haven't done it since I've met you.

1166
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:50,050
I've been on point with
everything to be honest.

1167
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:50,680
It's down to me.

1168
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,820
My misses a lot as well.

1169
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,570
She looks after me.

1170
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,403
Um,

1171
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:53,740
she,

1172
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:53,831
I,

1173
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:55,180
she goes out and works hard all day,

1174
00:30:55,181 --> 00:30:56,860
but whenever I get in from Jim about half,

1175
00:30:56,861 --> 00:30:57,101
seven,

1176
00:30:57,101 --> 00:30:57,610
eight o'clock,

1177
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,500
there's healthy food
there for me and stuff.

1178
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,150
Um,

1179
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:00,410
what,

1180
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,870
what kind of food do you do?

1181
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:05,260
Specify a lot of people
cut out carbs and stuff.

1182
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,980
I'm training so hard and sweating all
day and burning so much calories in the

1183
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:09,641
pts and stuff.

1184
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:10,301
I don't need your car,

1185
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,134
my carbs.

1186
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,490
That's a big factor.

1187
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:15,090
Like people need to understand that when
they're talking about low carb diets,

1188
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:17,270
it really dependent upon
how much exercise you do.

1189
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:17,770
Yeah.

1190
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,700
If you're running twice a day and
you're doing three hour workouts in the

1191
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:21,701
afternoon,

1192
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:22,970
like you're going to
need some carbohydrate.

1193
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:23,140
Yeah,

1194
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,561
exactly.

1195
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:24,430
I don't need to call them out.

1196
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:24,940
Um,

1197
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,810
even in the last week,

1198
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:26,571
a lot of people who say no,

1199
00:31:26,571 --> 00:31:27,730
it's last week fight camp.

1200
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,260
Wayne's coming up and he caught my cows.

1201
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:29,680
I'll,

1202
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,840
I'll still get up in the morning
and have massive bowl of porridge.

1203
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,520
I've still have rice with
my dinner and my fishing,

1204
00:31:33,521 --> 00:31:34,840
my salad and stuff like as well.

1205
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,000
I don't need to cut it out,

1206
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,221
but like I said,

1207
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:39,820
I was down to how much work
I'm doing and stuff like that.

1208
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,230
The amount you're burning,

1209
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,760
I mean Jesus Christ,

1210
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:44,140
the amount of calories
she must be burning.

1211
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,420
Well,

1212
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,620
I have my watch on over
there and I think at them,

1213
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,670
some of my almost nearly
5,000 or something ridiculous
and a 1000 calorie all

1214
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,350
day from betraying and
[inaudible] and stuff like that.

1215
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,140
That's insane.

1216
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,630
Just think about eating 5,000.

1217
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:55,880
Yeah,

1218
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,713
exactly.

1219
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:57,923
Yeah.

1220
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,021
Yeah.

1221
00:31:59,021 --> 00:31:59,854
That's crazy.

1222
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,240
So with you,

1223
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:03,880
do you limit the amount of
personal training you do?

1224
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,840
Because as the fight gets closer,

1225
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,440
if I'm not going to fight the pile on
and train once a day just to keep sharp

1226
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:12,274
and keep on top,

1227
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,323
top of my game,

1228
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:13,900
um,

1229
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,231
I might be,

1230
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:15,550
I do seven or seven hours,

1231
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,480
like no problem.

1232
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,610
And um,

1233
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,050
but as the fight gets closer on cross,

1234
00:32:19,051 --> 00:32:21,400
so I'll cook down and cook down and
cooked down because obviously I don't want

1235
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:22,211
my body being tired.

1236
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:23,044
I need a be,

1237
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,060
I've got a lot to lose there.

1238
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,720
Every time I fight I've
got my mom I can spread.

1239
00:32:27,721 --> 00:32:29,740
This is a brand now with these
seminars and stuff as well,

1240
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:33,430
so I need to make sure I'm going
in there as on point as I can be.

1241
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,200
So you think about it that way.

1242
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:35,860
You don't think about,

1243
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,740
you think about it as like
Europe basically a business.

1244
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,140
Yeah,

1245
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,351
yeah,

1246
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:39,710
of course.

1247
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:39,980
Yeah.

1248
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,813
And um,

1249
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,430
I've got a lot so I've got a lot
riding on it every time I fight.

1250
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:43,730
Yeah.

1251
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,660
I think that has been for a long,

1252
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,471
long time now.

1253
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:46,280
I mean loud,

1254
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,510
all the country gets behind me.

1255
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,080
There's a lot players out there as well.

1256
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:51,130
They want to see me lose and
they love it when I lose and um,

1257
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,553
tell me who they are.

1258
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,280
Well there's no getting around that man.

1259
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,360
If you're doing well,

1260
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:01,970
there's going to be people that it really,

1261
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:02,990
they just hate themselves.

1262
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,093
That's really what it is.

1263
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,890
What it is is they see someone who's out
there as exceptional and it makes them

1264
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:14,210
compare their own life to this guy who's
out there smashing everybody with 108

1265
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:15,044
fights and they go,

1266
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,400
fuck that guy

1267
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,420
kicking the Pudsey of a day.

1268
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,680
I got about four or five.

1269
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,420
I probably got loads
more than that actually.

1270
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,960
But there are four or five comments that
I noticed you said kicking that wrong

1271
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,151
far.

1272
00:33:27,151 --> 00:33:28,100
Would you click on the profile?

1273
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:28,934
Just have a look at them.

1274
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,860
You're all just selfies himself
eating chocolate bar and one of them,

1275
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,713
we have a dog.

1276
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,820
They're all about 175 kilos

1277
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,570
plot of video.

1278
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,010
The other day I was holding butts
in Pottsville and valleys out.

1279
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,000
I just old boxing paths are that

1280
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,960
you're dropping your left hand was like,

1281
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:47,540
all right then.

1282
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,110
Thanks [inaudible].

1283
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,150
If you ever have a fight,

1284
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:51,050
you're going to get knocked out.

1285
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,270
Oh,

1286
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:52,670
if I ever have,

1287
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,770
if I as a hundred knife fight,

1288
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,800
it's just hilarious.

1289
00:33:57,801 --> 00:34:01,220
It's somewhat actually say to
you that are kicking wrong.

1290
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:01,881
Like if anybody,

1291
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:02,930
all my friends out there,

1292
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:05,040
they get flustered by people criticize,

1293
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:05,874
know on social media.

1294
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,160
I want to point them to that.

1295
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,590
Liam fucking Harrison.

1296
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,540
Someone's telling him
he's kicking her are.

1297
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,170
That makes me want to cry.

1298
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,030
Laughing so hard.

1299
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,370
That's how fucking stupid some people are.

1300
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:23,450
But that just shows you that when you
have an open forum where anyone can

1301
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:24,200
comment,

1302
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,730
anyone can say something,

1303
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,550
you're going to run into a
certain amount of those people.

1304
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:28,610
That was just no getting around it.

1305
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,050
Yeah,

1306
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,670
I definitely can't look at the comments.

1307
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:31,971
You know,

1308
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:32,301
you can't,

1309
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:33,230
you can't read that shit.

1310
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,500
Just get assassinated
for from all corners.

1311
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,101
Well,

1312
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:37,671
the thing is,

1313
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:38,331
those people,

1314
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:39,950
they might not even mean
what they're saying.

1315
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,210
They just stood there.

1316
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,620
It's verbal diarrhea,

1317
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,580
they're just black.

1318
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:44,690
They're just angry.

1319
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:46,310
They're upset at the thing is,

1320
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:46,410
no,

1321
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:46,611
I've been,

1322
00:34:46,611 --> 00:34:49,970
if I looked at someone's video and I
fought that technique one on point or

1323
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:50,750
anything like that,

1324
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,501
I wouldn't have gone and,

1325
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:51,801
right.

1326
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:51,891
Yeah.

1327
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:52,280
I mean,

1328
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,860
well of course you,

1329
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,450
it gives you the right to go on
and like try to put someone down.

1330
00:34:55,451 --> 00:34:56,091
It's putting some dinner.

1331
00:34:56,091 --> 00:34:56,301
I mean,

1332
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:56,840
he's just,

1333
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,531
he's 12.

1334
00:34:57,531 --> 00:34:58,900
This is what I'm going to say is,

1335
00:34:59,090 --> 00:34:59,923
hey,

1336
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:01,800
Paul Kane,

1337
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,340
of course it was a competitor
or someone like that.

1338
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:04,861
And you know,

1339
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:07,790
if maybe someone's getting
undue accolades and you know,

1340
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,930
like to stay ain't shit.

1341
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,651
You know?

1342
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:10,071
Or if someone,

1343
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:13,250
you're supposed to know when you're
like 420 pounds sat around just eating

1344
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:14,061
burgers all days.

1345
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:14,640
Ridiculous.

1346
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,151
You know what I mean?

1347
00:35:15,151 --> 00:35:16,190
They can eat more than you though.

1348
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,180
Give a good point.

1349
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,900
Maybe,

1350
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,733
maybe not.

1351
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,473
[inaudible]

1352
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,583
man,

1353
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,950
I've sit down with some fighters
and you watch them eat and you like,

1354
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:26,660
where the fuck is all that going?

1355
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,973
You know?

1356
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,240
I mean there's very few things in life
that burn off more cowers and throwing

1357
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:33,060
kicks,

1358
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,490
you know,

1359
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,760
especially the way you throw them.

1360
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:35,923
And I

1361
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,100
like that this the amount of
fucking energy you're generating.

1362
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,621
Yeah,

1363
00:35:41,621 --> 00:35:43,600
I mean when I'm on the pods and stuff,

1364
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,660
every training session I've dropped
100% and especially when I'm on the Puds

1365
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,420
pads pad work is fucking awesome to watch.

1366
00:35:49,421 --> 00:35:50,530
It's very inspirational.

1367
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:51,310
It's very fun.

1368
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,450
Obviously as well with that.

1369
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,390
That's just a little clipper
while I'm doing on the pads.

1370
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:55,490
I mean my old pod work,

1371
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,373
it just made trap.

1372
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,900
Well sometimes it's just me
trying to smash the pods to pcs,

1373
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:00,530
but obviously it's a lot
more technical aspects of it.

1374
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,920
Not that's just like a little clip rubber.

1375
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,090
I look for what someone's feeling like,

1376
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:03,291
oh,

1377
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:03,761
that was good,

1378
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,594
so I'll put it right.

1379
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,760
But obviously there's bits
where Richard Stop Him,

1380
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,410
him putting me right what I'm doing wrong.

1381
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,860
Technique work in the game
plan is to fly out there.

1382
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,703
Obviously just little,

1383
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,400
little snippets that I just put up
with me doing things wrong apparently.

1384
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,240
But that's obviously there's a spar in
all the different technical side to it as

1385
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:20,074
well as that word.

1386
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,970
I mean that is like my style,

1387
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,760
but I don't fight totally just like that.

1388
00:36:24,761 --> 00:36:25,331
Just smash,

1389
00:36:25,331 --> 00:36:25,601
smash,

1390
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:25,891
smash.

1391
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:26,960
And you've got to be smart about it.

1392
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,210
Especially at the level of fighter.

1393
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,850
If I just started
smashing things like her,

1394
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,100
I'm just going to walk
on a shot at that level.

1395
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:34,060
It's going to be game over.

1396
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:34,631
Yeah,

1397
00:36:34,631 --> 00:36:35,464
there's no way.

1398
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,430
Now do you,

1399
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,690
in between fights,

1400
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:39,010
do you um,

1401
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,240
train with people?

1402
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:41,470
Would that have other styles?

1403
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:42,310
Are different styles,

1404
00:36:42,311 --> 00:36:45,460
like maybe some Kyokushin guys or
someone who's doing something different?

1405
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,650
I create a lot of,

1406
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,030
uh,

1407
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,450
[inaudible] is at the minute.

1408
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,320
Um,

1409
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,900
I've got quite a lot guys
coming to me and we've got,

1410
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,900
I've been doing a bit of work.

1411
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:53,400
We might do Casey from the UFC.

1412
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,070
He's been treating me a little
bit and he's down in Florida now.

1413
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:56,904
Train in there.

1414
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,133
Um,

1415
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,520
there's a gym in Leeds where I'm from
called Davy taste like a real hotbed,

1416
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,150
some topper MMA or guys out there.

1417
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:06,630
I've got a young kid called
Louis got 17 years old,

1418
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,340
seven and o in MMA.

1419
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,450
It'd been doing Muay Thai,

1420
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:12,860
but he's going to be an absolute
superstar in MMA and not

1421
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,391
his style.

1422
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:19,380
What he's got going on is so good because
he's got the standup and that we were,

1423
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,750
we found like a medium to
pull that into the MMA.

1424
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,120
So his eyes are on point,

1425
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:24,030
he's movements on point,

1426
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:26,280
but he still finds himself
in the positions to London.

1427
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,930
Moitai strikes with all that power.

1428
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:32,370
So generate the power and still be out
of there fast enough and quick enough not

1429
00:37:32,371 --> 00:37:32,581
to be,

1430
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:35,460
we're getting taken down and losing
balance and falling all over the place.

1431
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:35,930
Um,

1432
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,810
so I watch out for him.

1433
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:37,400
It's going to be,

1434
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:37,520
yeah,

1435
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:37,881
definitely.

1436
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:41,270
Can you just sign with a empty k Mack?

1437
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,260
The knife global.

1438
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,730
So I'm going to be working with Dave.

1439
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:44,361
Got Boxes,

1440
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:45,920
so I worked with the mind side of that.

1441
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:47,030
So they're getting onto it now,

1442
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,860
but they've also gone into MMA side.

1443
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:51,000
He'll sign with them as well till Sunday.

1444
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,520
They've signed them too.

1445
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:53,691
They've got boxes.

1446
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:57,680
They've got Billy Joe Saunders who I
know you like Tyson fury and Blah Blah

1447
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:57,681
Blah.

1448
00:37:57,681 --> 00:38:01,040
But they've also got an MMA side
run by carrying cattle and um,

1449
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:01,281
yeah,

1450
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:03,050
they've just signed Louis
Louis exceptional more.

1451
00:38:03,051 --> 00:38:05,880
The UFC is now coming to Liverpool
and the air until is going to be,

1452
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,090
but he doesn't have a fight yet.

1453
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,620
Not yet.

1454
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,920
I'm hoping it's going to be
[inaudible] they're talking Kamara.

1455
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,051
Ooh.

1456
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:14,280
Swan Hill and going
back and forth on tour.

1457
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,190
That guy gets no love.

1458
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:16,750
C'Mon what?

1459
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,310
[inaudible] seven and o in
the UFC smashes everybody.

1460
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:20,210
Everybody's scared of him.

1461
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,290
Nobody calls him out.

1462
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,390
I don't think till,

1463
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,870
I'm pretty sure til will be scared of him.

1464
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:25,200
He'd love it till one I love.

1465
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:25,950
So yeah,

1466
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,990
until it tells there've
been going back and forth.

1467
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:34,130
Definitely what filer and the standup
wise till has a massive advantage.

1468
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,210
And then on the ground,

1469
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,371
Ooh,

1470
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:35,731
smudge.

1471
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:36,040
You'd have an

1472
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,491
advantage.

1473
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:36,861
So it's,

1474
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:39,940
it's a very interesting fight
who sponsor fucking tank too.

1475
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,860
That guy's a fucking animal.

1476
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,620
They have not seen too much of him,

1477
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,030
but that's because
everybody's scared of him.

1478
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,060
Get fights.

1479
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,073
Well that day you go,

1480
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,321
Ooh,

1481
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,910
spawn is a fucking stud.

1482
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,650
I mean that guy is no joke.

1483
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:51,643
He like,

1484
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,450
there's very few people
calling that guy out.

1485
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,583
Bit of loving.

1486
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,250
Oh yeah.

1487
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,880
Tills the one that's calling
them out of there you go.

1488
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,880
That he thrives on stuff.

1489
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:02,250
I've known Darren since you were 16 years
old and I'm used to be used to train

1490
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,200
together like Moitai bucking.

1491
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,610
They used to come over my gym
bag company will be his coach.

1492
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,490
He used to work together and then part
of the work came and do bits of him and

1493
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:13,000
he's always had the attitude and I'm
never been scared of anyone always.

1494
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:13,451
I've been like,

1495
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:13,690
yeah,

1496
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:13,991
whatever,

1497
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:14,440
bring it on.

1498
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:14,920
Bring it on.

1499
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,753
I believe him this,

1500
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,450
there hasn't been a single guy in the UFC
with one fight that's got as much hype

1501
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:20,230
as that guy.

1502
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,470
You know,

1503
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,170
I'm fight fights.

1504
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,820
Cowboys smashes it.

1505
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,310
I mean you see what he
did to cowboy and Khalil,

1506
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,540
everyone knows the real deal as well.

1507
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,390
Special.

1508
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,490
It's one of these kids lack.

1509
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,480
When I seen him growing up,

1510
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,760
it's one of these kids that
you just come to any special,

1511
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,560
I mean the city's behind him.

1512
00:39:34,561 --> 00:39:36,030
Everyone cause he comes to our gym,

1513
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,460
what I trained four corners team,

1514
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:37,561
we,

1515
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:41,810
John Kelly's and barley and all
of them and making Allen and HR.

1516
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:42,710
It comes down as tech.

1517
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,760
She's at him but he wasn't
trained but I've changed that.

1518
00:39:44,761 --> 00:39:46,620
But he comes and sees
us and he's a great guy.

1519
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:47,670
But his coach,

1520
00:39:47,671 --> 00:39:48,504
Collin Heron,

1521
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,280
I grew up with kind of,

1522
00:39:50,281 --> 00:39:50,671
cause we,

1523
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:54,240
I was checking my TYC all muster scan
and we used to do demos and stuff cause

1524
00:39:54,241 --> 00:39:54,811
believe it or not,

1525
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:55,800
I used to be all right.

1526
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:56,940
And uh,

1527
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,620
column was always a little bit better.

1528
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,080
And since then he's got Karl Benz Carbon.

1529
00:40:01,081 --> 00:40:03,750
Jim needs a UFC fighters from Liverpool,

1530
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:07,470
but now he's got this star in
Darren and the whole city is,

1531
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,540
it gets,

1532
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,900
it gets a bit like give me leads.

1533
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:10,940
They just get swamped

1534
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,520
by people.

1535
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:11,620
No,

1536
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,411
it was this one,

1537
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,750
Darren was fighting more
tired than it became popular.

1538
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:14,960
Yeah.

1539
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,830
Well by default more tied than he ever,

1540
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:20,090
you were always like one of the most
naturally talented kids would ever see.

1541
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,920
Just Simon oddly that a different coach.

1542
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,280
He used to come down to our gym and
he'd have a fight coming up and um,

1543
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,350
it would just be wiping the floor.

1544
00:40:27,351 --> 00:40:28,070
We worked where everyone,

1545
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,740
it didn't even really train
out about their neighbor.

1546
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:31,760
He used to come down to a
young kid in mess around it.

1547
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,090
Ron,

1548
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:32,950
Ron Ryan,

1549
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,240
the Brailey Alec train was still turn up,

1550
00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:36,980
fight and win since then.

1551
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:37,551
So when,

1552
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:38,480
when that natural talent,

1553
00:40:38,481 --> 00:40:40,610
he's now got that dedication,

1554
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,450
the od.

1555
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,210
So someone who has that naturally
talented I'm doing is going to work.

1556
00:40:44,211 --> 00:40:45,840
The artist is going to be a foster.

1557
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:49,910
The Ralph Paul forced to be reckoned
with when he stepped in and caught cowboy

1558
00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:51,230
with that left elbow,

1559
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,413
stepped in and just,

1560
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,260
just drove up that elbow and
smash cowboys knows you like,

1561
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,251
wow,

1562
00:40:58,251 --> 00:40:59,090
that was fast.

1563
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,830
Close distance.

1564
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,060
Okay,

1565
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,360
quick.

1566
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:00,910
Yeah,

1567
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,620
we'll call him.

1568
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,370
He's trainer.

1569
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,203
He was a,

1570
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,130
it's a motorcar motor.

1571
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,810
Quanta's it Tai Kwon.

1572
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,261
Yeah.

1573
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:10,800
He was like Black Bella 11 or
something like that and you know,

1574
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,960
he's just calling takes no bullshit.

1575
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,243
You know,

1576
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,410
Colin just says that's the
way it's a bit like Richard.

1577
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,543
That's the way it is.

1578
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,480
That's what you gotta do.

1579
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:19,314
That's what you're doing.

1580
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,071
And since that,

1581
00:41:20,071 --> 00:41:22,560
since Darren's had that
influence in his life,

1582
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,390
like Liam said in the LBC,

1583
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:24,811
the story,

1584
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:25,710
but I'm going to Brazil,

1585
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,500
it's just uh,

1586
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,530
it's just been another level.

1587
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,540
What makes a guy naturally talented.

1588
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,010
But you take a guy like Darren till like
when you say naturally talent and like

1589
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:37,070
what is about a god like that
that just picks things up quicker.

1590
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,211
I don't hoists,

1591
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:39,260
it's hard to explain.

1592
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:44,261
Some people just walk in a bad company
gym and they'll have two free lessons and

1593
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:46,130
they'll just be able to delve that floor,

1594
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,701
the movement,

1595
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:47,810
the rhythm and stuff like that.

1596
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,711
More like that.

1597
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:50,190
Ever since I remember
when he first started,

1598
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:51,140
I remember his coach saying,

1599
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,243
I've got this kid you need.

1600
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:52,870
See,

1601
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,930
you need to come and look at him.

1602
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,490
South Park should see him kick.

1603
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:58,430
He's only been trained in a few
months and when I saw him I like,

1604
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,260
it looks like he's seasoned pro five,

1605
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:04,490
six years of training with our plenty
while out walking Najim at bud company and

1606
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:05,180
they'll come in,

1607
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,480
they'll have a few fights and the wow,

1608
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:07,663
so all right this,

1609
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,310
but as soon as it gets hard
and the level steps up in the,

1610
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:13,670
realize how hard they have to work
to actually compete at that level,

1611
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,630
that's the end of them.

1612
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,050
You don't really see him anymore and
it's like the biggest waste of time.

1613
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:17,631
And you've ever see,

1614
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:19,220
we've had plenty law for a ride.

1615
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:19,780
Yeah.

1616
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,260
He's not many times.

1617
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,370
Not Enough.

1618
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,160
No,

1619
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,240
not when you get to that level is to a
certain level when you can get yourself

1620
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:26,810
out of jail.

1621
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:31,220
But when the level of steps
up and everyone's working
hard and people who are as

1622
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:32,870
talented as you are working out,

1623
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,310
then that's when you're
going to be in trouble.

1624
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,280
That's why Darren has gone off and
done what he's done and that's why and

1625
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,570
showing what he's all about.

1626
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,710
There's this kid,

1627
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,540
a class,

1628
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,900
my youngest daughter,

1629
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:42,620
she's seven.

1630
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,970
She takes a martial arts,

1631
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:47,690
Texas mixed martial arts class and there's
this five year old and it's class and

1632
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:51,020
they're doing drills in their bag and I'm
watching this five-year-old kicked the

1633
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:51,710
bag,

1634
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,270
he's got his hands up high,

1635
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,410
he's moving like there's I fang
turns the hip over perfect.

1636
00:42:57,411 --> 00:43:01,010
Even as switch kick and I'm watching
his five year old and I went over to his

1637
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:01,844
parents and I went,

1638
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,530
if I was a strike,

1639
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:05,080
if I was like a us,

1640
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,290
a coach that was looking to
recruit a fighter and a young age,

1641
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,700
I grabbed that fucking kid.

1642
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:12,080
Like that kid's special.

1643
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:17,090
Like there's something that he figured
out at five at five all the other kids

1644
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,410
you're looking at all the
other kids in the class,

1645
00:43:18,411 --> 00:43:20,300
they're flailing their
arms all over the place.

1646
00:43:20,301 --> 00:43:21,230
I paid attention.

1647
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,980
This fucking kid is like this.

1648
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,530
His hands are glued right below his eyes.

1649
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:28,041
A Bang,

1650
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:28,460
Bang,

1651
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,180
crack,

1652
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:29,451
Bang,

1653
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:29,751
Bang,

1654
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:30,290
crack.

1655
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,030
Well I five our kids class it,

1656
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:32,864
bud company,

1657
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,050
I don't like training upstairs at same
time when they're on cause all the

1658
00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:37,040
technique is so good.

1659
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:37,821
It's embarrassing.

1660
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:40,580
Sometimes you look at them all
and you think like from six to 12,

1661
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:41,750
these are amazing.

1662
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,421
But like I say,

1663
00:43:42,421 --> 00:43:45,540
it's only the ones that really want it
or really willing to put the ab working.

1664
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,570
We'll go from the next
level in the next level,

1665
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:49,880
the next level cause a lot drop
off no matter how talented.

1666
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:50,130
Uh,

1667
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:54,410
not a lot of people like having to go to
that place where you need to go to get

1668
00:43:54,411 --> 00:43:55,244
to a good level.

1669
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:55,671
Yeah.

1670
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:58,640
He doesn't like people watching him
when he can't do things well either.

1671
00:43:58,930 --> 00:43:59,820
Like when he's learning thing,

1672
00:43:59,821 --> 00:44:02,300
he likes to go over in the corner
and practice things on his own.

1673
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,440
Like very interesting.

1674
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,680
And you watch like someone who's just
got like a special inclination towards

1675
00:44:06,681 --> 00:44:08,830
something called Shea Williams from uh,

1676
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,220
Liverpool and all the blokes
are talking about is eight,

1677
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,291
eight.

1678
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:13,130
I'm friends with his dad,

1679
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:13,851
MC eight,

1680
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:14,240
six,

1681
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,570
eight.

1682
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,403
Everyone's talking about,

1683
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,130
hey,

1684
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,000
all these guys,

1685
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:17,211
you know,

1686
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:18,140
these big shots,

1687
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,650
strong fall under,

1688
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,091
let me see,

1689
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,140
not a cage for him,

1690
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:21,560
but alien.

1691
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:21,790
Dot.

1692
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:23,360
H eight years of age,

1693
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,321
a lovely kid.

1694
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:27,690
But he's just one of these kids that
can do everything that I can balance.

1695
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,590
I'll tell you a video on youtube.

1696
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,970
We the oven as well then too young.

1697
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:33,211
Uh,

1698
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:36,390
the black American kids boxing coaches,

1699
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,750
that kid's amazing to see that
and the coach and what he was in.

1700
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:40,640
But the one I'll do in the park,

1701
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,000
he knows Marlin,

1702
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,710
most boxing trainers I've
ever seen in my life.

1703
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:43,971
He will,

1704
00:44:43,971 --> 00:44:45,210
he's like five years old.

1705
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:45,770
Exactly.

1706
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,070
Crate in the hand speed.

1707
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:49,883
Amazing.

1708
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:50,880
Brilliant.

1709
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,713
Best Video I've seen.

1710
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,610
Absolutely amazing.

1711
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:54,060
Yeah.

1712
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,100
That whoever fucks with
that kid in school.

1713
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:56,251
Yeah,

1714
00:44:56,251 --> 00:44:56,850
they're in trouble.

1715
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:57,930
That's a big problem.

1716
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:00,300
Maybe it's stopped campus setting
that thing saying you drop your left.

1717
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,213
I'm sorry.

1718
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,503
Sorry.

1719
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,870
You're getting hated on by six year olds.

1720
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:10,140
It's um,

1721
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,310
I think it's interesting today too as
opposed to in the past that you can watch

1722
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,140
videos like that and then you know,

1723
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:20,880
before you'd have to like watch a VHS
tape and sit down and analyze it and pause

1724
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:21,001
it.

1725
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:24,750
Like now you can be at a fucking bus top
on your phone and you could watch world

1726
00:45:24,751 --> 00:45:26,130
class fighters instantly,

1727
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,173
instantly.

1728
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,980
The thing with that is as well though
that with the Internet as well as being at

1729
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:31,441
watch world,

1730
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:32,520
classify it instantly.

1731
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,473
Here's a kid,

1732
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:35,460
that's his,

1733
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,151
him and his dad,

1734
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:36,391
I guess,

1735
00:45:36,391 --> 00:45:36,500
look,

1736
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,660
get out fucking technique.

1737
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:40,670
Unbelievable.

1738
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:41,670
It's incredible.

1739
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,870
He ducks under,

1740
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:43,681
I mean everything,

1741
00:45:43,681 --> 00:45:44,970
blocking punches.

1742
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,050
Fucking amazing.

1743
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:47,720
And look at that.

1744
00:45:47,721 --> 00:45:48,930
He goes through the body.

1745
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,490
That's crazy.

1746
00:45:50,491 --> 00:45:51,870
I mean he looks like he's four.

1747
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:52,920
That's a different kid.

1748
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,330
That's an even Tinier kid.

1749
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,170
Yeah.

1750
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,160
Very impressive.

1751
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:56,461
But yeah,

1752
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:57,750
the thing with eating it as well though,

1753
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:58,940
what's starting to happen now though,

1754
00:45:58,941 --> 00:46:00,600
a lot in especially in the UK,

1755
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,160
people are say,

1756
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,750
right?

1757
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,460
Um,

1758
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,540
we try and match your sure.

1759
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,201
Right?

1760
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:04,861
We've got a guy here,

1761
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:05,581
he's had free fights.

1762
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:06,031
Y'All guys,

1763
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:06,751
I'd free fights,

1764
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:07,381
let's match them.

1765
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:07,660
And they go,

1766
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:07,980
oh no,

1767
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:08,813
give me his name.

1768
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:09,990
I need to search him on Youtube.

1769
00:46:09,991 --> 00:46:11,840
And he searches Facebook
and hit search this.

1770
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,110
So as well as being a blessing,

1771
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:14,490
it's a curse for stuff lab because,

1772
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,120
but when I started fighting everyday,

1773
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,060
Richard had just gotten me,

1774
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:18,894
I'd walk into gym,

1775
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:19,201
Richard,

1776
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:19,440
go,

1777
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,430
you fighting on Saturday,

1778
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,630
this might be a Wednesday.

1779
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:21,860
Right.

1780
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,400
And I go,

1781
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,233
all right,

1782
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,810
and then not what I turned upside down.

1783
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:25,440
You have your fight,

1784
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,100
but now it's like,

1785
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:26,933
I want to know his name.

1786
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:27,780
He's Jim,

1787
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,613
what's his Facebook?

1788
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,060
Isn't that a badge of courage too?

1789
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:31,020
To be able to do that?

1790
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:33,060
Like that's something that
people would always admire.

1791
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:35,610
Like a God that would come into
the gym and someone would say,

1792
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,930
would you like to fight
this weekend and go,

1793
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:37,501
fuck yeah,

1794
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:38,251
Martini man.

1795
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:38,761
Anytime,

1796
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:39,091
anywhere,

1797
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:39,880
any place.

1798
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,020
Yeah,

1799
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,330
I mean that that is what you're here for.

1800
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:42,821
Everyone.

1801
00:46:42,821 --> 00:46:43,001
I know.

1802
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:44,130
Jim's always been like that.

1803
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:44,941
Well,

1804
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:46,290

1805

we've got a big junior circuit now
with Yaka Yaka and next generation.

1808
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:53,580
How do you feel about that?

1809
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:54,570
About little kids fighting.

1810
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,111
They don't fight.

1811
00:46:55,111 --> 00:46:55,944
Had concerns.

1812
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:56,721
No head gone.

1813
00:46:56,721 --> 00:46:57,790
Time kicks,

1814
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,633
body kicks.

1815
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,420
Moskal dessert.

1816
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,430

1817
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,860
I mean some of the kids had got,

1818
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:05,641
we got another kid.

1819
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:06,690
They can't head kick either.

1820
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:07,441
No,

1821
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:08,370
just strictly body.

1822
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:13,450
Some kids from like from Richard's
two sons Finley and forgive Joe.

1823
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,313

1830
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:22,660

1831
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:22,891

1834
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:26,810
Oh my God.

1835
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:27,170
Yeah,

1836
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,003

1837
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,580
do what I,

1838
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:30,871
we've been,

1839
00:47:30,871 --> 00:47:31,511
but this kid is,

1840
00:47:31,511 --> 00:47:32,081
he's special.

1841
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:32,801
He's taller than me.

1842
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:34,700
He's 13 he's taller than me fight,

1843
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,250
so about 59 60 kilos.

1844
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:37,450
I've done a lot of work.

1845
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:38,560
We've been one to one as well.

1846
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,040
He's dad has done an amazing job with him.

1847
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:41,680
Is that about,

1848
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,680
is he on beginning 36 five 36 fights and
he's 13 I think you lost in the f and

1849
00:47:48,621 --> 00:47:49,860
the final Rashi.

1850
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,470
I gaze a kid that was like 16 and
the weight four kilos heavier.

1851
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,240
They got another kid called Riley Smith.

1852
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,860
We've got some kid just in of,

1853
00:47:57,861 --> 00:47:58,540
sorry.

1854
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:58,870
Sorry.

1855
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,830
We got some moving around there.

1856
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:01,480
We've got some right kids
that are coming through.

1857
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:05,710
Jonathan Hogget who's just been on your
couch special and that's 20 years old.

1858
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:10,180
Be a great fire veteran called Keef and
really know what kind of program do you

1859
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:11,440
have for these young kids.

1860
00:48:11,441 --> 00:48:13,720
Do you have classes based on age groups?

1861
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:17,470
Do you have classes based on weight
classes or do you just have kids classes?

1862
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,580
Well Bud company gym,

1863
00:48:18,581 --> 00:48:19,440
the kids classes,

1864
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,190
six to 12 year old.

1865
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,970
There's about 40 or 50 sometimes
in our kids' classes and um,

1866
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,010
there'll be about three or four of the,

1867
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:29,920
the instructors taking it fight is all
I'll be open the ring fight training,

1868
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,200
intermediate three in the
middle of is down at the end.

1869
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,580
So everyone's got someone
care and reinforce,

1870
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:36,580
forum open and bring through all
the fires are working together,

1871
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,781
watching them.

1872
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:40,690
It's just like watching the mini
version of all our fighters upstairs,

1873
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,310
east class to watch.

1874
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:45,250
Sometimes I like just going and watching
them all trained in inspiring reach

1875
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,470
over and clinch in and helping each other.

1876
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,890
And then a lot of them will stay behind
after the class and really not putting

1877
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:52,180
the extra hours in the extra work.

1878
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:53,740
And the is good watching.

1879
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:56,710
Sometimes you'll see someone come
in the gym and they'll walk in,

1880
00:48:56,711 --> 00:48:56,921
right,

1881
00:48:56,921 --> 00:48:57,251
shy.

1882
00:48:57,251 --> 00:48:59,380
And then I look at them again two months
later and I've seen him on the pads.

1883
00:48:59,390 --> 00:48:59,980
Got Wow.

1884
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,340
Wow.

1885
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,000
Bomb.

1886
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,930
And he's like looking around going,

1887
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:02,061
yeah,

1888
00:49:02,061 --> 00:49:02,894
I see that.

1889
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:04,240
That's what's in the APP.

1890
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,200
And see him going through from being
like walking at Jimmy and a shy little

1891
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:08,471
seven,

1892
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:09,304
eight year old boy.

1893
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,620
And then the smashing the pads.

1894
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:12,580
And I've in the first fight,

1895
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,490
our junior team is so good
because obviously we've got
Richard and Lisa training

1896
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:15,940
him,

1897
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,930
but my cousin Andy,

1898
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,260
he's also a five time world champion.

1899
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:19,721
He's doing,

1900
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:20,231
pts,

1901
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:20,770
have a lot of them.

1902
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,660
Joel ribbons only like 19 years old,

1903
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:24,370
but he's so good with the kids as well.

1904
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,010
So they've got a wealth of experience.

1905
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,000
And um,

1906
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,481
like I said,

1907
00:49:28,481 --> 00:49:29,340
they're all just going but,

1908
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,050
but bup and the next minute they were
up there fighting and just smashing it.

1909
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:33,160
And I think we've got,

1910
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,330
we had 18 fights for our junior
team last week and I think we,

1911
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,620
we want someone like 16.

1912
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:41,890
So as to earlier when we
were working out together,

1913
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:42,490
you,

1914
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:44,920
you've never really
considered fighting MMA?

1915
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:45,910
No.

1916
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:46,743
Um,

1917
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:47,831
like I said,

1918
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:50,920
it took me a long time to get where
I am in Moitai and let's be honest,

1919
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,110
it was going to stand up in front of me.

1920
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:52,760
[inaudible]

1921
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:52,990
ring.

1922
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:57,880
I'd have to get my ground game song so
good attacking a long time and to be

1923
00:49:57,881 --> 00:49:58,151
honest,

1924
00:49:58,151 --> 00:49:58,770
I'm really enjoy.

1925
00:49:58,770 --> 00:49:59,990
I love Moy Tai.

1926
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,700
I love,

1927
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,670
I love fighting when we tie and I think
it can only be good at summit that

1928
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:04,540
you're passionate about.

1929
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,300
If I got in there and I thought well I'll
do this because there's a lot of money

1930
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:07,940
involved in it,

1931
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,440
that wouldn't be,

1932
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,800
I wouldn't be where I am.

1933
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,160
I find more time cause absolutely love it.

1934
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,580
Or your style though
was really interesting.

1935
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:20,310
It would apply very well when I'm
teaching the MMFR as I do Trey.

1936
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:23,500
And I think I've got that good medium
of all the striking needs to be.

1937
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:25,520
And without getting taken down and off,

1938
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:26,321
balancing yourself.

1939
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:27,154
Cause it,

1940
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,210
I'm not arrogant enough
to go in there and say,

1941
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:31,880
right Moy Moitai you
need to do this in MMA.

1942
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:32,661
We need to fight,

1943
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:33,500
lack a tie into that.

1944
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:34,311
I'm not arrogant enough.

1945
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:38,000
I know that has to be changes and I think
I do spot that well and it does work

1946
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:38,990
with the fight as a train.

1947
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:39,771
But,

1948
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:40,604
um,

1949
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:41,680
like I said,

1950
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,330
I love fighting.

1951
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:42,471
It's,

1952
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:42,581
I,

1953
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,080
that's where my eyes and um,

1954
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,760
maybe if someone came over it's,

1955
00:50:45,761 --> 00:50:45,981
you know,

1956
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:46,701
there's loads of money.

1957
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:47,534
Do you want to?

1958
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:48,371
Maybe yet,

1959
00:50:48,371 --> 00:50:49,280
but like it,

1960
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:50,140
um,

1961
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,170
I'm a stand fire.

1962
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,440
So have you done any wrestling or Jujitsu?

1963
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:55,310
I haven't,

1964
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:56,143
no.

1965
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,630
I've always been so
concentrated on Memorial Day.

1966
00:50:58,631 --> 00:50:59,090
I fight credit.

1967
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,440
I'm always booked out all year.

1968
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:04,210
I don't really get a fart about it
before doing it a bit wavy tea with Donna

1969
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:04,220
Mitchell,

1970
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,170
but I'm booked out when fights.

1971
00:51:06,171 --> 00:51:07,004
I've got July,

1972
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:07,843
August,

1973
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,200
October,

1974
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,410
November.

1975
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:10,070
You're already booked.

1976
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:10,641
I'm booked out.

1977
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:11,001
All right.

1978
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,060
So I the year that many fights in advance.

1979
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:14,570
Yeah,

1980
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,403
very than,

1981
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:16,431
yeah.

1982
00:51:16,431 --> 00:51:17,930
Year and a half in advance.

1983
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,003
A year and a half.

1984
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,653
Wow.

1985
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,800
Penciled in so I'm not going to have no
time anywhere cause I need to stay on

1986
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:28,340
top of my own train and just so I'm ready
to go from wound fight to the next and

1987
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:30,740
if you get injured I
obviously I have to pull out.

1988
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:31,460
I got to pull off.

1989
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,250
I brought my foot in my last
fight in Paris in December,

1990
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,950
brought my foot split machine and a,

1991
00:51:36,951 --> 00:51:38,180
I couldn't fight in March.

1992
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:39,440
I went to vote two weeks ago.

1993
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,870
Obviously I couldn't do that with
my injuries are part of the sport.

1994
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,280
Are you back to kicking things now?

1995
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,830
I'm back kicking 100% and I'm back.

1996
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,350
As soon as I get back home I'll be
back in camp ready to go in July.

1997
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,161
That's impressive.

1998
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:51,080
Three months later you
throwing hard kicks.

1999
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:51,431
Yeah.

2000
00:51:51,431 --> 00:51:51,890
Yeah.

2001
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,230
Now when you started working with Vinny,

2002
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:55,550
what was,

2003
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,410
what was the big difference?

2004
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:01,430
What's the big difference in doing
this mind coaching and like what,

2005
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:02,300
what have you noticed?

2006
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,400
Improvement in my awareness,

2007
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,600
like the stuff with a Hakalau,

2008
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:08,190
although we're on about
the anchor in it yet.

2009
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,350
Get awareness increases.

2010
00:52:09,351 --> 00:52:10,100
So when you anchor,

2011
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:10,401
what do you,

2012
00:52:10,401 --> 00:52:11,600
what are you thinking when you touch,

2013
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,760
when you smash your gloves together
at the beginning of the fight,

2014
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:14,330
I,

2015
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:15,141
I'm sure everyone,

2016
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:15,974
it will be different.

2017
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:17,660
What I'm doing is that when I'm pushing,

2018
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:18,300
mine goes together,

2019
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,550
all the stuff we've worked on,

2020
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:20,211
like the high cloud,

2021
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:20,751
the awareness,

2022
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:21,920
everything's all just coming in to man.

2023
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:22,540
The warrior,

2024
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,190
he sticks with me.

2025
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:24,440
That word will always stick with me.

2026
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:25,400
After we've worked before,

2027
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,160
I'm sure people have worked with him
and got different stuff that they're

2028
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:28,940
anchoring.

2029
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,920
Well that's what I'm on cream.

2030
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:30,920
When you say anchoring,

2031
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:33,400
what do you bring it in and
bringing it all back in?

2032
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:33,610
We,

2033
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:34,880
all the stuff that we've worked on,

2034
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:36,110
like when we did the,

2035
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,030
I don't know what fight the warrior stuff.

2036
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,820
We also had another fight
against Andre Corbin.

2037
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,280
I got raw off by everyone in this fight.

2038
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,780
You'd been to England twice before.

2039
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:47,150
It knocked out two of our
top guys in the way above me.

2040
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,740
So I stepped up him where to fight him
and I went and did a bit of work with any

2041
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:52,130
then.

2042
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:56,960
Then there were a few keywords that
we said then one of them were visible,

2043
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:00,310
visible damage of what were the
of warm hot knife through butter.

2044
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:01,730
A hot knife through butter.

2045
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,910
Cause I said hot hot knife through butter,

2046
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:06,510
you guys and your God damn accidents.

2047
00:53:06,511 --> 00:53:09,070
Would you learn how to
speak American cheese,

2048
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:10,340
hot knife through butter.

2049
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,440
So what pretty good.

2050
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:15,381
It's pretty good.

2051
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:18,260
I'd said to Vinny is I said I don't just
want to beat these guys and everyone

2052
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:18,770
dragging me off.

2053
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:21,200
I said I want to smash him
to absolute smithereens.

2054
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:22,910
He told me the game plan,

2055
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,770
he told me the game plan.

2056
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,070
He told me what it was going to do

2057
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,100
with ruin our,

2058
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:28,330
we're going to win no one,

2059
00:53:28,331 --> 00:53:28,890
believe me.

2060
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:29,130
Yeah.

2061
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:30,540
And then I obviously,

2062
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,374
because you know,

2063
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:32,640
if you didn't mention it,

2064
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:34,260
I'm his biggest fan and um,

2065
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:34,620
and,

2066
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,431
and what we did,

2067
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:36,450
I did a CD for him.

2068
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,850
So I said listen to this
CD before he goes to bed.

2069
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:40,400
So I recorded this,

2070
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,170
this CD and it was weird because I was,

2071
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:43,441
again,

2072
00:53:43,441 --> 00:53:44,250
I was commentating,

2073
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,930
thankfully on it was on
the main event wasn't yet.

2074
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,860
And I was watching it and it was like
playing a video game cause it's just like

2075
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:50,610
low kick bank.

2076
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:53,700
It was just like and everything that I
and all the thing that I said kind of

2077
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:54,830
kind of cheat in it.

2078
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:55,800
I was like,

2079
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,380
it's like a hot knife
through butter anyway.

2080
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:58,291
Bang.

2081
00:53:58,291 --> 00:53:59,110
And he just,

2082
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:02,620
I mean if you ever see the absolutely
destroyed cooler and cooler been is,

2083
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,690
is a legendary fight from
Bellaruse and it was just,

2084
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,670
it went down.

2085
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,031
Yeah.

2086
00:54:08,031 --> 00:54:12,790
Every time I think that's what we're
coming into my head and the way we vote.

2087
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,051
You're going,

2088
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:13,371
it's weird.

2089
00:54:13,371 --> 00:54:15,480
It's hard to explain unless you
actually do work with humans.

2090
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:16,560
But yeah,

2091
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,220
it worked again.

2092
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:17,740
Perfect.

2093
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,471
[inaudible] perfect.

2094
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:20,810
And that one was the game plan
that people didn't believe.

2095
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:21,350
Um,

2096
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:21,831
I said,

2097
00:54:21,831 --> 00:54:22,551
what everyone has said,

2098
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,560
I'm going to stop him in
three rounds and because he'd,

2099
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:28,220
I will moving up in where and because
he knocked out two of the top fires in

2100
00:54:28,221 --> 00:54:31,880
England from that Web or
Michael Dixon first round.

2101
00:54:31,881 --> 00:54:33,800
And I think he's stopped
in Runcorn as well.

2102
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,060
And um,

2103
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,430
I told everyone I'm going to stop him.

2104
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:37,280
He says,

2105
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,531
I said,

2106
00:54:37,531 --> 00:54:38,210
these legs,

2107
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,800
his legs to stretch
from a smashed his leg.

2108
00:54:39,801 --> 00:54:40,341
I'm gonna stop him.

2109
00:54:40,341 --> 00:54:41,140
A low kicks it will be.

2110
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,100
And I said it'd be like a
hot knife through butter.

2111
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:44,840
And I stopped to being round three.

2112
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:45,683
We low kicks.

2113
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,930
Now when you were creating this

2114
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:49,160
CD form,

2115
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,250
like what was the goal?

2116
00:54:50,251 --> 00:54:51,180
What was your objective?

2117
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,410
You told me what it was going to do.

2118
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,760
So I reaffirmed that.

2119
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:56,160
So we did like a trance thing,

2120
00:54:56,161 --> 00:55:01,161
why you go into lead anyone
into an induction and then
just played out the fight

2121
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:03,144
in his mind,

2122
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,620
telling him the specifics of what he told
me and how he speaks because you have

2123
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:09,090
to use that language back to them.

2124
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:09,601
If I said,

2125
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:13,100
you know something that's not in their
vocabulary of obviously I'm not saying

2126
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:13,993
you think

2127
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,320
smacking.

2128
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,530
Well so he's got to add lots of like,

2129
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,920
you know what he told me into the,

2130
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:22,980
into the CD.

2131
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:24,530
So it eh,

2132
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:25,600
Eh,

2133
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,970
and it went and it works.

2134
00:55:26,971 --> 00:55:27,870
I've never done it before.

2135
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:28,561
It was a gamble.

2136
00:55:28,561 --> 00:55:29,041
I just thought,

2137
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:29,874
you know what,

2138
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:31,720
when

2139
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,291
cause he was like,

2140
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:34,570
you could probably do
that for a lot of people.

2141
00:55:34,571 --> 00:55:34,800
Right?

2142
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,730
Like different things that
you're trying to work on.

2143
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:39,190
If you could just like listen
to it and like in your,

2144
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:41,010
like in your ear buds
or something like that,

2145
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:41,913
you're doing

2146
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:42,540
awesome.

2147
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,373
You know,

2148
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:44,000
I,

2149
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,650
I've been,

2150
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:45,880
I have people now,

2151
00:55:45,881 --> 00:55:47,140
it worked with me for a year,

2152
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,540
like clients that want to work for a year,

2153
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:50,530
they pay me for he end,

2154
00:55:50,531 --> 00:55:53,170
they just want to ring
me and talk about stuff.

2155
00:55:53,171 --> 00:55:56,210
It's become like a real dark sort
of different than hypnotherapy and,

2156
00:55:56,211 --> 00:55:59,890
and just being a therapist in just not,

2157
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,090
so it's that sort of way.

2158
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:02,740
But yay is possible.

2159
00:56:02,741 --> 00:56:04,030
And look,

2160
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:04,900
I,

2161
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:08,280
the reason why we're doing this
is because number one of the sad,

2162
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:09,163
he's my friend,

2163
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,210
but number two,

2164
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,470
what we do works.

2165
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:12,460
There's not,

2166
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:13,630
these are tried and tested.

2167
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,531
He's eight work signs.

2168
00:56:14,531 --> 00:56:15,364
We'll jump in.

2169
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:16,510
I'm his mind coach,

2170
00:56:16,511 --> 00:56:16,751
you know,

2171
00:56:16,751 --> 00:56:16,990
vice,

2172
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:20,860
he's got a great culture and Richard and
everybody bought what we do works and

2173
00:56:20,861 --> 00:56:22,210
people are starting to see the benefits,

2174
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:24,550
the feedback we've got
like San Diego Boxing Club,

2175
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,380
you know [inaudible]
and Jesse and all them.

2176
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,630
It's been mind blowing isn't it?

2177
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:33,730
Well there's definitely good states of
mind to go into anything that's difficult

2178
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,481
and again,

2179
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:34,841
findings,

2180
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:38,170
one of the most difficult things and
then there's bad states of mind and those

2181
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:43,171
states of mind can determine the outcome
and just to have something that you can

2182
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,090
get to in your mind that could
put you on the right path.

2183
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,081
Like what you were saying,

2184
00:56:50,081 --> 00:56:55,030
warrior or hoc allow like are these
anchors aren't doing like these different

2185
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:55,271
things.

2186
00:56:55,271 --> 00:57:00,271
Like I feel like these are applicable
for everyday life to exactly that.

2187
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:02,860
This is something that people
could really benefit from.

2188
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:07,861
Like to just to add to instead of just
being like random and wild with your

2189
00:57:07,871 --> 00:57:09,010
thoughts and your ideas,

2190
00:57:09,011 --> 00:57:12,910
going into something and hoping that
you have a good point of view and a good

2191
00:57:12,911 --> 00:57:17,440
perspective instead of that like have
these clear paths that you've already

2192
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:18,310
thought through.

2193
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:18,710
Yeah,

2194
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:19,543
I mean your mind,

2195
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:23,610
you might have Savak class at
nine a set as to no way to go.

2196
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,230
We think of it like a ton of time.

2197
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,740
I sat know sat nav,

2198
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,830
you plug that in that direction and
that's the role is it's going to take you

2199
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:30,490
to,

2200
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:31,480
if you put in the wrong guy,

2201
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:31,900
I look,

2202
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,260
say you've touched someone in Illinois
and you're driving around Los Angeles

2203
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:35,591
looking for,

2204
00:57:35,591 --> 00:57:36,490
you're not going to find it.

2205
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:40,810
So we have to be specific and what
I do is I try and get my programs.

2206
00:57:40,811 --> 00:57:45,520
I do various programs that I do is I have
to get what the client wants and then

2207
00:57:45,521 --> 00:57:46,331
once they get their client,

2208
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:47,650
once I put that in,

2209
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:50,170
but then to find out what's getting
in their way through the language,

2210
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,730
the kind of language it wrong.

2211
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:52,390
You know,

2212
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:53,770
they say I want this and said,

2213
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:53,921
yeah,

2214
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:54,900
but you're saying none.

2215
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:55,783
And

2216
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:57,910
I love the job.

2217
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:58,340
It's,

2218
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,490
it's such a blessing to
be and are not being,

2219
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:00,910
I'll,

2220
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:01,570
you know,

2221
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:04,630
rose tinted glasses and
I absolutely love my job.

2222
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,550
I love people like the
people with the feedback.

2223
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,310
If I had of getting messages
saying I feel different,

2224
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:10,144
I'm happier.

2225
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,380
There's no bad job in the world.

2226
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,243
Not at all.

2227
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:12,670
Well,

2228
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:13,150
I mean,

2229
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,820
you know better than anybody
that I was a fighter.

2230
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:20,850
The way you think and your mindset that
that affects your training and affects

2231
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:22,201
your outcome.

2232
00:58:22,201 --> 00:58:24,850
It affects how you feel
in between trainings.

2233
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:25,420
It's like,

2234
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,850
and then absolutely
affects the way you fight.

2235
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:28,121
Yeah.

2236
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:28,781
Cause it does.

2237
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:29,530
I mean,

2238
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:30,290
I reckon like a,

2239
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,031
I've mentioned earlier,

2240
00:58:31,031 --> 00:58:33,820
I reckon I've lost fights on points
because my mindset's been wrong.

2241
00:58:33,821 --> 00:58:34,720
Going into it thinking right,

2242
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:36,020
this is gonna be an absolute Wallace.

2243
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,900
And then I've gone in there thinking,

2244
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:38,111
right,

2245
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:38,771
I'm ready for war,

2246
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:41,500
I'm ready for this and I've got alcohol
in it because I've gone in there

2247
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:43,480
thinking that if I in there
may be a bit more relaxed,

2248
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,950
sharper on point,

2249
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,580
I'd been playing the game but
I wonder adjusted and adjusted.

2250
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,100
But then by fault,

2251
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:50,620
you know,

2252
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,360
I mean like you just said it happens.

2253
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,613
But um,

2254
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,740
if you are on point with your mind that
needs to be as strong as your body.

2255
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,331
Like I said before,

2256
00:58:58,331 --> 00:59:00,940
he can never ever be too well prepared.

2257
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,953
That's why I've,

2258
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:02,903
I've gone to Vinay,

2259
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,170
I've used him and it has
worked for me in massive,

2260
00:59:05,171 --> 00:59:05,980
massive,

2261
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,880
massive fights.

2262
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,900
Do you meditate at all?

2263
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:08,830
Um,

2264
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:09,850
I do the Wim Hoff method.

2265
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:11,160
Ah,

2266
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:11,860
again,

2267
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:12,693
Vinny,

2268
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,713
Vinny,

2269
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:14,710
Vinny and Jordan.

2270
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:15,551
Show me about that.

2271
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:18,760
I remember I saw Jordan doing it one
time before our fight and say no,

2272
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:19,181
what you're doing.

2273
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,530
Then it told me where I'm off.

2274
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,990
So out of any white wall.

2275
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,050
And then I started with a
cold showers every morning,

2276
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:25,630
the breathing and um,

2277
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,390
again I've seen massive changes in
that in like my heart rate and that is

2278
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:30,770
absolutely amazing how that works.

2279
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,491
He's resting.

2280
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:34,340
Pulse rate was 31 now
Jordan Jordan's with 30.

2281
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,220
Mine will say to fuck.

2282
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:39,810
Yeah that one beat.

2283
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:40,740
Yeah.

2284
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:41,573
Yeah.

2285
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:44,100
I went to a women's house luckily.

2286
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:44,750
I know,

2287
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,620
cause I worked for infusion and they
did a little bit of a documentary on him

2288
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,220
and I went with Mohammed Kamel um,

2289
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:52,161
who I know really well.

2290
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:52,994
Great Guy.

2291
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,020
And we went to his house and we went in
the frozen water and all that sort of

2292
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:57,291
stuff.

2293
00:59:57,291 --> 01:00:00,470
And then I started following thing and
stuff and a seen him on your show twice.

2294
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:01,863
Um,

2295
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:05,750
he's a slight like a jet
Dyani he's brilliant.

2296
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,890
There's something about him,

2297
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:07,340
his,

2298
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,600
his perspective,

2299
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,210
his and his enthusiasm is not,

2300
01:00:11,211 --> 01:00:12,440
it's not just infectious.

2301
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:13,970
It's like it changes you.

2302
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,390
Qg He changes the way you think about it.

2303
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,090
I want to meet him.

2304
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:17,661
We'll definitely want to.

2305
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:18,440
He's awesome.

2306
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,273
He's all set up.

2307
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:20,143
I'll hook that up.

2308
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,473
Absolutely love that.

2309
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,030
Have you done cryotherapy at all?

2310
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:23,471
I have,

2311
01:00:23,471 --> 01:00:24,270
yeah.

2312
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:25,610
A friend in Liverpool dock,

2313
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:26,781
he's got one.

2314
01:00:26,781 --> 01:00:27,200
I've,

2315
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,910
whenever I've now had a real,

2316
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,530
obviously my body gets
real lot of wear and tear.

2317
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:30,980
Holding,

2318
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,940
holding pads takes a lot out here,

2319
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:36,260
especially when you've got to train
twice as well on top of that if fucking

2320
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:36,801
forearms,

2321
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:37,030
right?

2322
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:37,370
Yeah.

2323
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:38,203
Yeah.

2324
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:41,420
My back and obviously
from spar in my legs.

2325
01:00:41,421 --> 01:00:42,254
A beetle.

2326
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,660
Yeah.

2327
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:46,010
Fucking elbows and forearms.

2328
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:46,171
Yeah,

2329
01:00:46,171 --> 01:00:46,590
exactly.

2330
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:49,600
I get stiff and after an hour we
could train in adweek or teaching.

2331
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,211
I do need that.

2332
01:00:50,211 --> 01:00:52,970
So I go over to Liverpool and I jump in
now and I always come out feeling like a

2333
01:00:52,971 --> 01:00:54,080
million books all the time.

2334
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:54,351
No,

2335
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:54,920
I love it.

2336
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,401
I love it.

2337
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,300
What about a isolation tanks?

2338
01:00:57,301 --> 01:00:59,000
Have you done a sensory deprivation tank?

2339
01:00:59,030 --> 01:00:59,180
Oh,

2340
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,013
I'd never done that.

2341
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,120
We've got one here.

2342
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:01,953
We want to try it.

2343
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:02,451
Hell yeah.

2344
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:03,380
How much time do you get?

2345
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,363
How much turn off

2346
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:10,890
[inaudible] you think that you
go and as long as you want.

2347
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:12,140
All right.

2348
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,100
I have one right over here.

2349
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,750
Fucking love it man.

2350
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:15,584
It's amazing.

2351
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,990
Since we've come to California,

2352
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,790
we've got just feel super aimia mates
from v that might eat Murphy's got him on

2353
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:24,630
CBD oil that's doing all that.

2354
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:28,880
Having all the cool things and
still great with CBD is as Fucking,

2355
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:29,763
I don't have it here.

2356
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,130
I left it in my car.

2357
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,080
I have this lotion,

2358
01:01:33,081 --> 01:01:34,070
CBD lotion.

2359
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:38,890
You put applied topically where you got
like bruises or told me not tried the

2360
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:39,820
great man,

2361
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:40,680
but I got a test.

2362
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:41,840
Yeah,

2363
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,100
I got a test done by um,

2364
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,530
my sponsors like the took all
the hair follicles out in there,

2365
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,620
the tested them all and so they
could test what I should be in,

2366
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:50,130
what food's good for me here.

2367
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,440
Fall Hair follicle test.

2368
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:51,591
Yeah,

2369
01:01:51,591 --> 01:01:53,210
like the proper sending it off to the lab.

2370
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,170
They tested it all and it came back
with that and not blood or I'm not sure.

2371
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,610
I have no idea how it works.

2372
01:01:58,611 --> 01:01:59,600
But the came back in and said,

2373
01:01:59,601 --> 01:01:59,781
right,

2374
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:00,600
this is what you should eat.

2375
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:00,800
Sweet.

2376
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,251
You shouldn't be.

2377
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:02,080
If this is in your diet,

2378
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,880
tragic now because this is causing
some disruption here and stuff.

2379
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:07,010
It really in what kind of
stuff are they saying causes?

2380
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,030
This might be horse shit,

2381
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:09,923
right,

2382
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:13,010
so what about your toenails?

2383
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,350
So certain different fruits and stuff.

2384
01:02:15,351 --> 01:02:15,560
Flat.

2385
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,770
There was saying that rubbery
isn't raspberries and nuts
and stuff were causing

2386
01:02:18,771 --> 01:02:22,880
some sort of disruption in my diet that
it'd be better if I took him out and

2387
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:24,623
almonds.

2388
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,720
I went to one of those places and
they told me to stop eating Avocados,

2389
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:30,680
like get the fuck there's
along with Avocados.

2390
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:31,523
You guys are quiet.

2391
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,453
Avocados.

2392
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:33,750
Oils are great for you.

2393
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,490
Best foods you can eat.

2394
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,121
I'm like,

2395
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:38,850
what avocado fuck out of here.

2396
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:42,030
I just want to say is we've been
there for a couple of weeks now,

2397
01:02:42,031 --> 01:02:42,301
right?

2398
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:45,840
The coolest thing I've seen is how
the fuck did you hit that target?

2399
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,213
My mind,

2400
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,073
I could not believe it.

2401
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:48,830
The archery target,

2402
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:49,980
that was an amazing,

2403
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:50,791
well it was.

2404
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:51,790
I would do it every day.

2405
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,800
You're taught

2406
01:02:55,850 --> 01:03:00,850
sheriff 45 yards and to hit that
little small hole like that is not that

2407
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:01,620
difficult.

2408
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,120
You just don't have
training session as well.

2409
01:03:03,121 --> 01:03:05,100
So you would have had a bit
of a shake or he was sweating,

2410
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:08,070
but I just broke the
record of kicking that pad.

2411
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:08,904
So I was excited.

2412
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:10,093
That's,

2413
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,330
we got an a film.

2414
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,970
Luckily we were a little concerned.

2415
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:18,340
We had a splice sound from
the other one because uh,

2416
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:19,120
yeah,

2417
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,360
we had more than one
recording of it luckily.

2418
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:22,050
But um,

2419
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:23,460
that thing that uh,

2420
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:27,300
Francis and Ghana punched that
almost as hard as I kicked that.

2421
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:28,740
That's how fucking hard that,

2422
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:28,891
oh,

2423
01:03:28,891 --> 01:03:32,550
here it is right here it is
Francis Punch that fucking thing.

2424
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:33,403
That was as hard as,

2425
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,730
where's one 52?

2426
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,793
That's the highest.

2427
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,500
That's the highest anybody's
ever registered on that.

2428
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:44,483
Someone to break it.

2429
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:44,960
Some of them.

2430
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,170
I mean,

2431
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:46,740
I don't think that many
people are kicking that thing

2432
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:49,803
a bitch,

2433
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:52,080
but um,

2434
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:52,321
yeah,

2435
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:53,760
that archery thing,

2436
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:54,060
man,

2437
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:54,241
I,

2438
01:03:54,241 --> 01:03:55,770
it's the same thing as like,

2439
01:03:55,771 --> 01:03:58,470
like today when you were
showing me different things,

2440
01:03:58,471 --> 01:03:58,890
like,

2441
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:02,430
like you guys showing me just
a little bit of an adjustment,

2442
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,900
change the power of that kick.

2443
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,970
Just that little extra salt,

2444
01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:06,804
body mechanics,

2445
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,341
every,

2446
01:04:07,341 --> 01:04:08,071
every strike,

2447
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:08,904
every sweep,

2448
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:11,160
everything I teach is
always body mechanics.

2449
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:12,390
And just like that little bit extra.

2450
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:13,480
We'll get this,

2451
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:14,610
this same thing with archery.

2452
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:15,660
With archery,

2453
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:20,160
it's all about posture and form and
you've got to have your elbow up high and

2454
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:22,800
everything has to be perfect and
you're pulling with your back.

2455
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:23,581
I mean,

2456
01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:26,160
there's a lot of parallels
between archery and fighting,

2457
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:26,880
but you just,

2458
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,080
you just went truth.

2459
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,720
Denay well this was the
outro when he just went,

2460
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:32,971
I thought,

2461
01:04:32,971 --> 01:04:33,421
shit,

2462
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:34,254
you don't need to fight.

2463
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:36,000
But I do like again,

2464
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,070
I do that every day.

2465
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:37,351
I said,

2466
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:37,480
man,

2467
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,290
you know,

2468
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:39,900
I shoot arrows every day and I,

2469
01:04:39,901 --> 01:04:41,400
that's a 45 yards of my house.

2470
01:04:41,401 --> 01:04:42,330
I do 90 yards.

2471
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:43,743
Yeah.

2472
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,600
So that's about as far as it shoot
an animal though was 45 yards.

2473
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:52,530
Like maybe it shoots a pig or something
that nobody gives a shit about.

2474
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,340
Like,

2475
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,690
well shoot it like seven yards.

2476
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:57,600
You lucky you don't have them in England,

2477
01:04:57,601 --> 01:04:57,811
man.

2478
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:59,010
We got problems with them here.

2479
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:00,180
What pig problems are,

2480
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:00,811
they're fucking,

2481
01:05:00,811 --> 01:05:02,010
they're invasive species.

2482
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,060
They're crazy.

2483
01:05:03,061 --> 01:05:03,871
And they breed three,

2484
01:05:03,871 --> 01:05:06,540
four times a year they'll
have like 10 12 pigs,

2485
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:07,920
a litter climate at the pigs.

2486
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,013
Yeah,

2487
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:09,700
fulltime.

2488
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:09,880
Yeah.

2489
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:10,713
Sounds like my life.

2490
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:12,990
Hi,

2491
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:13,261
Beth.

2492
01:05:13,261 --> 01:05:13,870
Knife for tomorrow.

2493
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:14,161
Lisa,

2494
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:14,994
by the way,

2495
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:16,023
sweetie,

2496
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:16,720
you got,

2497
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,230
um,

2498
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:17,890
if there's,

2499
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,660
there's videos of pigs and Texas.

2500
01:05:19,661 --> 01:05:23,100
Texas is so bad that they
opened up a highway and a,

2501
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:24,280
the day they opened it,

2502
01:05:24,281 --> 01:05:26,350
they built this highway
in the day they opened it.

2503
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,140
There was something like
40 car accidents with pigs.

2504
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,130
If people were driving by the pigs run
across the road and they're just slamming

2505
01:05:33,131 --> 01:05:37,840
them into up there millions of pigs and
Texas millions while they're an invasive

2506
01:05:37,841 --> 01:05:38,560
species.

2507
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:42,220
They were brought over here in
California by William Randolph Hearst.

2508
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:45,710
You know that crazy guy that Orson
Welles made that movie Rosebud about.

2509
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,550
He's also the reason why
marijuana's illegal over here too.

2510
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:54,060
He made those propaganda articles blaming
marijuana for causing Mexicans and

2511
01:05:55,781 --> 01:05:57,340
blacks to rape white women.

2512
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,050
It was this crazy propaganda,

2513
01:05:59,051 --> 01:06:02,920
but it was also that he didn't have to
switch his factories over to hemp because

2514
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:05,980
they had come out with a new machine
called the decorticator that allowed them

2515
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:07,510
to process hemp fiber.

2516
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:07,720
Hemp,

2517
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,220
hemp just makes it way better paper.

2518
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:12,880
And he had all these paper mills and
all these forests that were dedicated to

2519
01:06:12,881 --> 01:06:15,250
trees a day they would make paper out of.

2520
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:17,440
And so when they came out
with this decorticator,

2521
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:17,670
you know,

2522
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:18,071
I felt like,

2523
01:06:18,071 --> 01:06:20,530
well hemp is the new industry
is like yet the fuck it is.

2524
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,920
And so he this crazy asshole
like literally is the
reason why marijuana is so

2525
01:06:26,531 --> 01:06:28,060
illegal and demonized,

2526
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:30,130
not just in America but around the world.

2527
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:32,650
And he led a bunch of fucking
wild pigs loose on his,

2528
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:33,130
his,

2529
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,360
his gigantic estate.

2530
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:36,310
These fucking things are everywhere,

2531
01:06:36,311 --> 01:06:36,940
bro.

2532
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:37,810
This ain't shit.

2533
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,351
I mean these,

2534
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:40,850
these look more like fucking
nightclub in leads design.

2535
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:42,740
These are domestic pigs,

2536
01:06:42,741 --> 01:06:43,574
bro.

2537
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,481
Jamie,

2538
01:06:44,481 --> 01:06:45,050
these are not,

2539
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:45,960
these are not wild pig.

2540
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:46,580
Yeah,

2541
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:48,290
it's shut down a freeway in Texas.

2542
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:48,890
Oh,

2543
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:49,700
you know what it is though.

2544
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,290
That's like a truck fell over.

2545
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:51,411
Yeah,

2546
01:06:51,411 --> 01:06:52,220
they were inside it.

2547
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:52,521
Yeah.

2548
01:06:52,521 --> 01:06:53,900
But those are like regular pigs.

2549
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,350
Wild pigs would never be
around a person like that.

2550
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,880
They would fucking be out of there.

2551
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:00,103
In Bhutan.

2552
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,620
Bhutan puts our country called
Bhutan and Yvette that the,

2553
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,270
the feed pigs cannabis,

2554
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,700
the cannabis probably tastes good,

2555
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:09,650
but he'd make them delicious.

2556
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:10,940
Bacon gets you high as fuck.

2557
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:11,783
Yes.

2558
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,640
You get drug tested like Canelo you go.

2559
01:07:13,641 --> 01:07:14,474
It's because

2560
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:18,320
you guys don't believe
Canelo with the Clenbuterol.

2561
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:20,390
I've done a logical of look doorway

2562
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:23,240
that Lord to us.

2563
01:07:23,241 --> 01:07:25,160
You got to appreciate Canelo as well.

2564
01:07:25,161 --> 01:07:25,341
Right?

2565
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,031
I mean the canals,

2566
01:07:26,031 --> 01:07:26,940
if that motherfucker,

2567
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,310
he's a great fire.

2568
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,253
Um,

2569
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:32,840
but I just had the Casie Casie
pastor Gigi when this time.

2570
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:33,681
Yeah,

2571
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:35,390
well I think GGD one the first time.

2572
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:35,631
Yeah,

2573
01:07:35,631 --> 01:07:36,620
I do definitely.

2574
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:38,000
I think by two or three rounds,

2575
01:07:38,001 --> 01:07:41,660
the first fight I think really I think
keeps out first paper view fight.

2576
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:43,131
I'm first,

2577
01:07:43,131 --> 01:07:43,520
you know,

2578
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:43,941
big,

2579
01:07:43,941 --> 01:07:44,301
big,

2580
01:07:44,301 --> 01:07:44,850
big fine.

2581
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:47,340
Or You could tell that he
didn't see me sell fairly tall.

2582
01:07:47,341 --> 01:07:49,070
They took him sort of
three or four to get going.

2583
01:07:49,071 --> 01:07:49,341
But when,

2584
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:52,300
when he did and then found that steady
pressure and got behind his job.

2585
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:52,520
Yeah,

2586
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,150
yeah.

2587
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:53,983
He's brilliant.

2588
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:56,640
And we've seen that little clip that
he said he's going to change something.

2589
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,950
It's going to go to the body more.

2590
01:07:58,090 --> 01:07:58,690
You think you should?

2591
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:01,250
I think you should have done that in
the first fight when he was up on the

2592
01:08:01,251 --> 01:08:01,750
roads.

2593
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,680
Can I little really good at
surveys and he's right underneath.

2594
01:08:03,681 --> 01:08:05,860
If he had gotten to the
body then I think plus one.

2595
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:07,010
I think there's going to be a lot of that.

2596
01:08:07,011 --> 01:08:08,600
And I think there's
gonna be a lot more jabs.

2597
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:14,060
Jab is just so under age like we did
to David Lemieux smashed him a piece is

2598
01:08:14,111 --> 01:08:14,740
where each job.

2599
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:15,280
Yeah.

2600
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,820
What Abel Sanchez said that when you,

2601
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:18,140
when he turns to the right,

2602
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:19,850
what happened was the referee was,

2603
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,850
because he was turning to is ace.

2604
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:22,973
He's left.

2605
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,170
So to get away from the right and yet
it was exposing these back and Gigi had

2606
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:28,004
hit in there.

2607
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:31,460
It was worried about getting a point
taken off so the referee would have called

2608
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:32,180
them on that.

2609
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,013
That's ridiculous.

2610
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:33,710
Yeah.

2611
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:34,543
He should be on punch.

2612
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,350
The referee was as bad as the judge.

2613
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:37,701
Well,

2614
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:40,940
there was one to late but believable.

2615
01:08:40,941 --> 01:08:41,774
Sweet Lady.

2616
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,250
Very nice lady.

2617
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:43,671
Thank fuck.

2618
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:45,730
Like lassie is like that light muscle man.

2619
01:08:45,731 --> 01:08:46,121
She,

2620
01:08:46,121 --> 01:08:48,560
she was responsible for some
wacky ass fucking decisions

2621
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:51,920
and no one does anything about it.

2622
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:55,620
What do you have a man boxing once you
did it in a wholly fully feels cold?

2623
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:56,950
She um,

2624
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,660
a part of the whole package out.

2625
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,260
Uh,

2626
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:01,093
Tim,

2627
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,510
the fuck's his name?

2628
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:03,500
Um,

2629
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:05,020
uh,

2630
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:05,853
oh yeah,

2631
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:07,820
yeah,

2632
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,360
yeah.

2633
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,200
Wasn't she a part of that?

2634
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:10,370
I know she,

2635
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:11,630
I think she was part of the,

2636
01:09:11,631 --> 01:09:16,120
I think she's the one that give Canelo a
draw or against Mayweather when he got,

2637
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:17,103
yeah.

2638
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,090
Really?

2639
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:18,923
Yeah.

2640
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:22,100
I think she should be fired.

2641
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,840
And that was close to the nice lady again.

2642
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:24,763
Very nice lady.

2643
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:29,010
Stevie wonder boiled of Candela.

2644
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:29,680
Dragons,

2645
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,081
Mayweather.

2646
01:09:30,081 --> 01:09:32,510
I mean he got fucking
schools in that fight.

2647
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:32,980
Masterful.

2648
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:33,290
Yeah.

2649
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:34,123
Big Time.

2650
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,091
I'll get along.

2651
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:35,520
They did it.

2652
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,190
Not much,

2653
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:37,190
but not much.

2654
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:38,060
That was an interesting,

2655
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:38,450
well,

2656
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:39,770
in his defense,

2657
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:44,020
Mayweather drained him down to
like have done a one foot two.

2658
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:46,300
They calls that.

2659
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:47,423
Do you know that?

2660
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:48,050
They said,

2661
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,520
well we'll find you at one 52.

2662
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:51,220
Elena Delle everyone.

2663
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:52,093
Okay.

2664
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,210
Cause he said it was going to do,

2665
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:54,150
it won't 54.

2666
01:09:54,151 --> 01:09:54,710
And he says,

2667
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:56,690
we don't care what Gil
downsell bone 52 and they went,

2668
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:57,703
thanks.

2669
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:01,640
He just left herself wide
open to doubt themselves.

2670
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:05,520
It could tell he was
seriously sluggish in mix.

2671
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:06,463
Anyone looks all good stuff.

2672
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:07,303
Don't need to be fair.

2673
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:07,680
Joe.

2674
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,481
He does man.

2675
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:09,380
He's amazing.

2676
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,210
Like what Floyd is able to do,

2677
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:13,050
like his control of distance and his,

2678
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:16,640
his understanding of what you're
going to do next is so incredible.

2679
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:20,390
Like you see him pop jab and then before
the guy even throws the right hand,

2680
01:10:20,391 --> 01:10:23,360
he's like the garden and
the right hand passes him.

2681
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:25,370
He pops with a left
hook and he's out there.

2682
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:25,941
He's like,

2683
01:10:25,941 --> 01:10:26,151
Bitch,

2684
01:10:26,151 --> 01:10:27,020
I knew what you were going to do.

2685
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,460
It did that where it mark
had to do it that way.

2686
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:29,070
They popped him.

2687
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:29,980
Then they were gone.

2688
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:33,780
Right buck of him before I even
realized great things with Roberto,

2689
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:34,850
Roberto,

2690
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:35,810
Roberto Guerrero,

2691
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:39,050
because we've got a boxer in
England called Josh Kelly.

2692
01:10:39,051 --> 01:10:39,860
It'd be seen him.

2693
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:40,340
Yes,

2694
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:41,720
I have with that guy.

2695
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:41,991
Yeah.

2696
01:10:41,991 --> 01:10:43,810
You guys have a lot of
great boxes over there now.

2697
01:10:43,811 --> 01:10:45,410
I mean obviously you have the
world champion and Anthony,

2698
01:10:45,411 --> 01:10:46,090
Joshua,

2699
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:48,320
he hit the UFC is going
to offer him $500 billion.

2700
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:50,080
That is fine.

2701
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,020
And I wonder if that's real.

2702
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:51,740
They wait,

2703
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:53,990
I wonder if it's real Joshua
verse and then garden with them.

2704
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:56,720
So we're going to sleep.

2705
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,190
She's Christ.

2706
01:10:58,210 --> 01:10:58,470
I,

2707
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:59,090
you know what I mean?

2708
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:01,220
Francis is a great MMA fighter,

2709
01:11:01,221 --> 01:11:02,660
but he's been fighting for five years.

2710
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:05,510
He just hits fucking unbelievably hard.

2711
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:09,740
Can't believe that you said he
got under in 2001 20 something.

2712
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:10,610
I think.

2713
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:11,550
Find out what it's playing on.

2714
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:14,580
That's so crazy.

2715
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,080
This is what I get with a kick.

2716
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:17,760
You legs,

2717
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:19,230
it carry you around all day.

2718
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:21,150
I'm only hundred behind him.

2719
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:23,070
Well you know,

2720
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:25,650
in his defense he's a hundred pounds
heavier than maybe with just what in the

2721
01:11:25,651 --> 01:11:27,720
fuck his hands are so big.

2722
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,980
Every time I shake his hands I'm like,

2723
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:30,180
how is that a person?

2724
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:31,620
I mean it's like,

2725
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,420
it's like shaking hands with a brick,

2726
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:34,650
like a giant brick.

2727
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:35,790
They're just so big.

2728
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:38,320
I've got a little baby and as
well they probably crush mine.

2729
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:39,303
Yeah,

2730
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,770
fucking huge dude,

2731
01:11:40,771 --> 01:11:41,490
man.

2732
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:41,851
I mean,

2733
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:43,470
and we were talking before about how his,

2734
01:11:43,471 --> 01:11:43,590
uh,

2735
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:44,341
in his background,

2736
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:46,920
he worked as a child in a sand mine,

2737
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:50,790
digging sand just all day digging sand.

2738
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,421
Like what a,

2739
01:11:51,421 --> 01:11:53,300
what a great workout
that is for your boss.

2740
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,420
Go Star is ridiculous.

2741
01:11:54,421 --> 01:11:59,421
Or let's say we're almost fucked with
five years ago at UFC title and came real

2742
01:11:59,641 --> 01:12:03,560
close if anybody else
other than Steepbanks tpa.

2743
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:06,750
So fucking tough and skilled
and kept away from him.

2744
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,990
But well you saw what he did to
Overeem k one Grand Prix champion,

2745
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:10,801
dream champion,

2746
01:12:10,801 --> 01:12:12,030
Strikeforce heavyweight champion.

2747
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,980
Frances put him into
orbit is Agnelli came off,

2748
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:18,570
he showed his mind were ridiculous
and you could see the way over he was

2749
01:12:18,571 --> 01:12:19,404
fighting him tooth.

2750
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:23,390
It's like Yo,

2751
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:28,390
where the fuck up at any moment is
this it 129,161 I got one fifth,

2752
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:31,891
what was it?

2753
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:34,410
One 50 to two that was today though.

2754
01:12:34,411 --> 01:12:35,810
The other day I got,

2755
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:38,190
I was super fucking happy with uh,

2756
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:39,390
Taiwan spawn.

2757
01:12:39,391 --> 01:12:41,190
What's the former previous record?

2758
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:42,030
One 14.

2759
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:45,930
He's got 1209000100 61 with a punch.

2760
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,340
I got one 52 today,

2761
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:48,303
bitch.

2762
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:51,450
But that's what his arms man.

2763
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:52,040
I mean that is,

2764
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:52,440
it's,

2765
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:57,440
it's possible to really overemphasize
how fucking crazy that kind of power is

2766
01:12:58,591 --> 01:13:00,960
with your bigger than
my legs ought to have a,

2767
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:01,880
Oh yeah,

2768
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,081
no,

2769
01:13:02,081 --> 01:13:02,581
don't pick it.

2770
01:13:02,581 --> 01:13:03,660
The mind like saint my legs.

2771
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,740
Well a guy like that,

2772
01:13:07,741 --> 01:13:10,020
I believe Francis is 33 I mean,

2773
01:13:10,021 --> 01:13:13,240
imagine if they caught him
when he was 24 you know,

2774
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:13,621
I mean,

2775
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:14,640
imagine that guy.

2776
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:15,300
It's like,

2777
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,440
that's what you were saying before.

2778
01:13:16,441 --> 01:13:18,630
It's when you get a real champion,

2779
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,540
what you're getting is the top genetics,

2780
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:22,374
the tops,

2781
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,311
talent,

2782
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:23,791
skill,

2783
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:28,440
mindset and disciplines
and the one in one in it.

2784
01:13:28,441 --> 01:13:29,540
That's the main thing.

2785
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:30,160
Because a lot,

2786
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:30,993
a lot of fighters,

2787
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:32,720
a lot of nod fight and they'll go,

2788
01:13:32,721 --> 01:13:32,941
oh,

2789
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,860
I've seen this again in our gym.

2790
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:35,941
They'll get out,

2791
01:13:35,941 --> 01:13:36,700
they'll have one,

2792
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:37,830
but the fight will have been hard.

2793
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:38,461
And I remember saying,

2794
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:38,581
no,

2795
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:39,414
come backward.

2796
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:40,231
I thought,

2797
01:13:40,231 --> 01:13:43,290
what a hot fucking fight it's
going to be is meant to be odd.

2798
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:43,600
Yeah.

2799
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,091
He's meant to,

2800
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:44,510
you know,

2801
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:45,510
he signed it up for you.

2802
01:13:45,511 --> 01:13:46,321
You know what you do.

2803
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:48,870
And then I've never seen him again.

2804
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:49,853
Yeah.

2805
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:52,410
So that they'll kind of it as well.

2806
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:53,263
I mean,

2807
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,560
certain amount of,

2808
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:59,340
of real sort of you is to be world
champion pretty much straight away.

2809
01:13:59,341 --> 01:14:00,310
Didn't you when you started?

2810
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:00,631
Yeah,

2811
01:14:00,631 --> 01:14:01,320
of course.

2812
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,250
He was 19 when you went,

2813
01:14:02,251 --> 01:14:02,351
you,

2814
01:14:02,351 --> 01:14:02,770
first of all.

2815
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:04,800
So it's crazy.

2816
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,800
First Time I fought Sanjaya we're 21.

2817
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,540
What's going on with Giorgio Petrosyan?

2818
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:10,910
A ace fine and on,

2819
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:12,310
um,

2820
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:12,790
uh,

2821
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:14,080
won championships.

2822
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:14,411
Oh,

2823
01:14:14,411 --> 01:14:16,340
he's fighting now.

2824
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:18,040
They've got to stand up now.

2825
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,013
Yeah.

2826
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:19,400
Yeah.

2827
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,040
Sign like Fabio pinker [inaudible] Cli.

2828
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:23,800
They signed yachts,

2829
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:26,800
yachts and Clyde retirees back again.

2830
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:29,600
Fought last month and he wanted
to him a couple of weeks off

2831
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:32,570
that guy.

2832
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:37,510
Get fucking punch man for south
Florida's we'll call that guy is starches

2833
01:14:37,511 --> 01:14:37,871
people.

2834
01:14:37,871 --> 01:14:38,440
I remember,

2835
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,890
I remember when they
Jordan for him in Thailand.

2836
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:45,640
I went the corner for Jordan and Jordan
came back at the end around two or gum.

2837
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,120
She'll die when I went.

2838
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:47,900
Oh,

2839
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,733
my teeth are in it.

2840
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:49,840
It's not totally deep.

2841
01:14:50,030 --> 01:14:50,863
Wow.

2842
01:14:52,010 --> 01:14:53,410
Jordan and real close fight with him.

2843
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:55,743
He is,

2844
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:57,100
was had the first time.

2845
01:14:57,101 --> 01:14:57,600
I can't,

2846
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:57,760
no,

2847
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,381
I remember Jordan's.

2848
01:14:58,381 --> 01:14:58,780
Yeah,

2849
01:14:58,780 --> 01:14:59,140
yeah.

2850
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:00,040
I mean it's uh,

2851
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:00,980
it did,

2852
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:04,330
the level of talent these days
is just so fucking amazing.

2853
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:07,870
And one is one FC really huge in Asia,

2854
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:09,670
like how they've got,

2855
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,050
and they like UFC level.

2856
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,020
Michael Chavela was doing that.

2857
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:16,210
I love that guy.

2858
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,030
He's now a fitness slide,

2859
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:20,150
like free different,

2860
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,890
they've got the MMA and then they've
got the hybrid or is Moitai in little

2861
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:24,910
gloves in the cage,

2862
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:25,840
like John Wayne Parks,

2863
01:15:25,841 --> 01:15:27,480
the take EMT,

2864
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:32,770
and then they've got just a standup
Moitai with eight ounce gloves and I'll

2865
01:15:32,771 --> 01:15:33,604
raise it cable under the

2866
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,640
cable with the eight ounce gloves.

2867
01:15:36,641 --> 01:15:38,500
So they're gonna freeze separate things.

2868
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:42,760
Now there's certain guys that you
just see a silhouette of them.

2869
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:44,260
Even if you didn't see their face,

2870
01:15:44,261 --> 01:15:45,370
you would know who it was.

2871
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:45,940
Yeah.

2872
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:46,190
You know,

2873
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:48,490
my favorite that is San Chai.

2874
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:51,650
Like if you saw a silhouette
of him just moving around,

2875
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,120
you'd be like,

2876
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:52,530
oh yeah,

2877
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:52,910
fine.

2878
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:53,500
Free Times.

2879
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,180
I'm used to in boot in
me all over the place.

2880
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:57,700
What does that like fighting that guy?

2881
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,470
You know what it wants
so much power or any,

2882
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,440
he's accurate.

2883
01:16:05,441 --> 01:16:06,880
If he wants to hit you
straight on the chin,

2884
01:16:06,881 --> 01:16:07,810
you will hit your stride on the chin.

2885
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,420
She wants to kick you
clean across the ribs.

2886
01:16:09,421 --> 01:16:10,630
He'll kick it clean across the ribs.

2887
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:11,920
The first time I fought him,

2888
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,590
ironic 21 it,

2889
01:16:13,591 --> 01:16:14,860
we're real close fight.

2890
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:17,320
I just showed him a little
bit too much respect.

2891
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:18,161
So again,

2892
01:16:18,161 --> 01:16:19,090
like I was saying about the,

2893
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,200
I don't want to fight
earlier I was saying,

2894
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:21,190
get me pretty much get me really much.

2895
01:16:21,191 --> 01:16:22,420
I could do better than that can do better.

2896
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:24,850
And I honestly believed
going into that fight,

2897
01:16:24,851 --> 01:16:24,921
I,

2898
01:16:24,921 --> 01:16:25,754
we're going to win.

2899
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,920
And in the second fight with absolutely
smashed each of it to smithereens.

2900
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,660
I caught him really bad.

2901
01:16:31,661 --> 01:16:32,171
I rocked him,

2902
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:32,760
appoint cheese,

2903
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:33,480
he hurt me.

2904
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:33,890
Um,

2905
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:35,740
as well of a punch and wobbled Maya legs.

2906
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:37,560
We absolutely buttered each of her.

2907
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:38,620
I remember in round four,

2908
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:41,050
I won the fourth round and
he went grit in the corner.

2909
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,310
I went and sat down and went,

2910
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:42,930
fucking hell.

2911
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:43,750
I'm gonna wind here.

2912
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,910
I'm going to win by the
time around five and up.

2913
01:16:45,911 --> 01:16:46,241
And again,

2914
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:47,470
I'll call her back in skin.

2915
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:49,540
I blinked and he'd
kicked me about 16 times.

2916
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:51,600
And how the fuck did he do that?

2917
01:16:51,601 --> 01:16:55,250
I ended up round to my coach and my
coach went cause he's sunshine and a

2918
01:16:56,290 --> 01:16:57,200
champion for nothing.

2919
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,260
It's his eyes and stuff
like that second fight.

2920
01:16:59,261 --> 01:17:00,970
Even though I lost days,

2921
01:17:00,971 --> 01:17:05,140
one of my favorites because to be able
to push the greatest of all time well or

2922
01:17:05,141 --> 01:17:10,141
at least of the last 25 years into that
deep water and they are really proud of

2923
01:17:10,701 --> 01:17:12,710
that and it [inaudible]
our best moments in spot.

2924
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,540
And even said afterwards
said that one of my,

2925
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:15,650
one of my toughest fights.

2926
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:16,791
But we're good.

2927
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:18,190
We're good friends now and stuff and um,

2928
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:20,390
I'll probably go over to Thailand
and train with him at some point.

2929
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:22,940
What amazes me about him is his movement.

2930
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,990
He's very unusual and the way he moves
around a light on his feet again and out

2931
01:17:26,991 --> 01:17:31,310
and switch the stances constantly and
is very creative with his approaches.

2932
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:32,690
Like he does all sorts of weird shit.

2933
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,100
Like there's one fight,

2934
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:36,020
it's on his um,

2935
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:36,811
San Chai,

2936
01:17:36,811 --> 01:17:37,700
Thailand.

2937
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,150
Um,

2938
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:38,930
Instagram.

2939
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:39,763
He,

2940
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:44,370
he's got a guy up against the ropes and
he steps hard to the right and throws a

2941
01:17:44,371 --> 01:17:46,280
left high cabinet texted me that off.

2942
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:47,990
It's like straight up in the air.

2943
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,990
But if you watch what
he does first like this,

2944
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:54,090
if you watch what I do is first I think
he sets it up by kicking the leg and,

2945
01:17:54,091 --> 01:17:55,350
and bringing me over one over it.

2946
01:17:55,610 --> 01:17:57,310
But you see the master of Arts to Florida.

2947
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,640
I remember the first time I fought him,

2948
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:02,760
he jumped in the air and I looked up
and I got kicked in the leg and I'd fall

2949
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:03,700
the fuck with other dot.

2950
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:05,031
Don't look at him.

2951
01:18:05,031 --> 01:18:05,511
And he had it.

2952
01:18:05,511 --> 01:18:08,120
But I mean like got kicked and
I'm thinking how did they do that?

2953
01:18:08,121 --> 01:18:09,770
And then when I watched
it back I realized,

2954
01:18:09,771 --> 01:18:10,770
and yeah,

2955
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:12,110
some of the stuff that he does,

2956
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:13,460
no one else can do that.

2957
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:14,420
He's so creative

2958
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:19,370
and that's what you get with these
guys as well as sees everything

2959
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,350
that they've said.

2960
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:24,190
Same sorts that he's a
Llama Chenko Muay Thai.

2961
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:24,860
Right.

2962
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:25,300
Definitely.

2963
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,091
The way he even,

2964
01:18:26,091 --> 01:18:27,530
he hits pads are different.

2965
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:28,900
Like the way you hit paths,

2966
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,010
what he's,

2967
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,070
he's just tapping,

2968
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:32,651
he pop pop,

2969
01:18:32,651 --> 01:18:34,690
but he's not hitting it
and now over the last,

2970
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,560
but you don't want to
get hit by any of it.

2971
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:40,310
But he's like constantly moving
when he wants to it hard as well.

2972
01:18:40,311 --> 01:18:43,010
Like kind of like I said a few
times easily clean on chin.

2973
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:44,030
And I remember thinking fucking hell,

2974
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:44,864
I want expecting that.

2975
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:45,261
Yeah.

2976
01:18:45,261 --> 01:18:46,730
Where it's like working the pads,

2977
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:49,010
like when you see the way he throws kicks,

2978
01:18:49,011 --> 01:18:49,844
like he's not,

2979
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:51,013
he's not like,

2980
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,090
and he could probably
do that shit all day,

2981
01:18:53,091 --> 01:18:54,740
just so loose and flexible,

2982
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:54,951
but,

2983
01:18:54,951 --> 01:18:55,310
but,

2984
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:57,860
but he's a fucking tremendous fighter man.

2985
01:18:57,861 --> 01:18:58,241
And he stayed,

2986
01:18:58,241 --> 01:19:00,290
must be faced 7.8 now and he's still,

2987
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:03,980
is he 38 met 37 38
that's why it's amazing.

2988
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:04,310
Yeah.

2989
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:08,470
And he's still wiping the floor with
most of the incredible people who fight.

2990
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:09,141
I mean,

2991
01:19:09,141 --> 01:19:12,170
and just constant movement and attack his,

2992
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,850
his pressure and his,

2993
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,860
the volume of strikes that he throws.

2994
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,030
I mean,

2995
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:18,860
he's a fucking unbelievable fighter man.

2996
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:19,220
Yeah,

2997
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,150
definitely a pro.

2998
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,400
The best of out out
over the last 20 years.

2999
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,890
I mean even did one fight
in the stadiums in Thailand.

3000
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:26,850
Two on one and in this one,

3001
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:27,620
one one,

3002
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:28,071
one one,

3003
01:19:28,071 --> 01:19:28,781
and this was this,

3004
01:19:28,781 --> 01:19:29,810
we're only about five,

3005
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:30,644
six years ago.

3006
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:31,291
Pet Boone.

3007
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:31,770
True.

3008
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:32,603
So I get now,

3009
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:35,240
so essentially we're ranking
board punchy with number two.

3010
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:36,590
So I got no problem number three.

3011
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:39,080
And these weren't like
less fight as an AME.

3012
01:19:39,081 --> 01:19:40,340
He farm two on one.

3013
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:41,420
How the fuck did he do that?

3014
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:42,470
Sag it down.

3015
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:42,770
Got It.

3016
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:47,110
Not a pit bull jewel got him for the
first two rounds fault and he went out and

3017
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,580
we just try to wear him down and
clinch him for the last three rounds.

3018
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:51,950
Saget dodgem team fresh Sanjoy one.

3019
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,083
Wow.

3020
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,650
Paul pet plan.

3021
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:55,483
She's a clincher.

3022
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:58,430
The [inaudible] tried to wear him down.

3023
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:00,080
That is fucking insane.

3024
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:00,943
Oh there we go.

3025
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:04,550
So he fought one guy for two rounds
and then the second guy for him fresh.

3026
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:04,970
Yeah.

3027
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:06,080
Unbelievable man.

3028
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:07,000
That is unbelievable.

3029
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,010
The size difference as well.

3030
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:10,050
The last mile is bigger
than him that he's like,

3031
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:11,870
well he's always fighting bigger guys.

3032
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:12,240
Right?

3033
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,560
He got to do a giveaway in the stadiums
with the other bet in works out there.

3034
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,590
No one had been a bet of.

3035
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:20,550
Sunshine comes in at one three five and
pat Boone trail comes in at one 45 no

3036
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:22,590
one's going to bet because they
know essentially is going to win.

3037
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:27,030
But of sunshine comes in at one fair and
pet boot shoe comes in at one 44 then

3038
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:28,050
he's even any up a little bit.

3039
01:20:28,051 --> 01:20:28,761
Then the gamblers,

3040
01:20:28,761 --> 01:20:29,910
we'll all get on it and he's going to,

3041
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:34,020
that's what's also interesting
about Thailand is that the gambling,

3042
01:20:34,021 --> 01:20:37,800
it's such a giant part of the sport
influences it so big and it influences the

3043
01:20:37,801 --> 01:20:39,690
scarring in the decisions
and stuff like that.

3044
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,770
But what about like guys fixing fights
you whereby [inaudible] you're worried

3045
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:45,150
about fighters,

3046
01:20:45,151 --> 01:20:45,841
froing fights,

3047
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,340
but then they'll get thrown
out steady in the world.

3048
01:20:47,341 --> 01:20:47,841
Be a of fight,

3049
01:20:47,841 --> 01:20:49,200
but can they do hear about that a lot?

3050
01:20:49,201 --> 01:20:52,490
Y'all swear about people dropping stuff
in people's drinks to try and just like

3051
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:54,840
give them a little of bunny
so when they're gamblers,

3052
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:55,340
yeah,

3053
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:56,410
that happens a lot to me.

3054
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:56,971
Got Pies.

3055
01:20:56,971 --> 01:20:58,980
And when he fought Sros
in Chelsea and said to me,

3056
01:20:58,981 --> 01:20:59,601
whether it's true or not,

3057
01:20:59,601 --> 01:20:59,970
don't know.

3058
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:00,751
So don't quote me on it.

3059
01:21:00,751 --> 01:21:00,991
But the,

3060
01:21:00,991 --> 01:21:02,180
he told me that when he fought none,

3061
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,040
Nathan Pauper mock,

3062
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:03,943
he said they gave,

3063
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,050
they gave him a drink and he said he
was dizzy and that because they will not

3064
01:21:07,051 --> 01:21:07,321
fight.

3065
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:10,500
I think the ad about a million bucks
side but so it's about 20 grand side bet

3066
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:11,400
their gym and this gym.

3067
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:12,181
So you do it,

3068
01:21:12,181 --> 01:21:13,510
do Arabic stuff happening like that.

3069
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:14,430
Wow.

3070
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:15,263
That sucks.

3071
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:17,490
That's a wild ass fucking place.

3072
01:21:17,491 --> 01:21:18,210
Thailand,

3073
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:18,451
right?

3074
01:21:18,451 --> 01:21:18,540
Yeah,

3075
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,200
yeah,

3076
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,033
yeah.

3077
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:21,343
I'm sure.

3078
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:22,621
Yeah.

3079
01:21:22,621 --> 01:21:22,981
I love it.

3080
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:23,320
I love,

3081
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,760
I love going to the foods that,

3082
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:25,261
you know,

3083
01:21:25,261 --> 01:21:26,850
especially coastal maybe when I go,

3084
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:28,420
yeah I love Thai food.

3085
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,130
Beautiful coast from HP to fall.

3086
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,133
But you know,

3087
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,280
you know bank cops,

3088
01:21:32,281 --> 01:21:33,230
beautiful thing.

3089
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:34,710
I scratch too much time in Bangkok.

3090
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,060
I lived there for like
18 months to two years.

3091
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,840
So yeah.

3092
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:43,280
So whenever I go now I prefer to go to
the island so I can train and then relax.

3093
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:43,741
Cause when I went,

3094
01:21:43,741 --> 01:21:46,740
I was just living in the gym
all the time and I couldn't,

3095
01:21:46,741 --> 01:21:47,910
I don't think I could do that anymore.

3096
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:50,970
Now it's for to now could
go silk sheets baby.

3097
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:52,500
Yeah,

3098
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:53,580
I can train odd.

3099
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:54,760
And then I come in.

3100
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:55,170
You had the,

3101
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:55,611
I'm fingers.

3102
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:58,700
I were locked in a room in the gym with
nothing but a fun blowing hot air on me.

3103
01:21:58,920 --> 01:21:59,753
No Air Con.

3104
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,011
Oh,

3105
01:22:00,011 --> 01:22:01,800
it ties it all at foster sleep snoring.

3106
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:05,100
And I'm just there sweating me at off
and having two hours sleep a night and I

3107
01:22:05,101 --> 01:22:05,910
couldn't do that anymore.

3108
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:07,200
Now I don't know.

3109
01:22:07,201 --> 01:22:07,531
I like,

3110
01:22:07,531 --> 01:22:08,400
I go to the island,

3111
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,960
I can still train just as art.

3112
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:11,160
There's some great coaches.

3113
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:12,330
I still barren can go to the beach,

3114
01:22:12,331 --> 01:22:12,931
you can relax.

3115
01:22:12,931 --> 01:22:14,790
And it's like [inaudible]
is that where you go?

3116
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:15,410
Uh,

3117
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:18,140
[inaudible] it's um,

3118
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,280
that is put out a safe place to go to.

3119
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:20,911
Yeah.

3120
01:22:20,911 --> 01:22:21,340
You know,

3121
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:21,630
you know,

3122
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:23,760
silence safe everywhere you go.

3123
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:26,820
They used to like seeing junkin
not that I ever drink over that

3124
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,060
stumbling down the road for rangs.

3125
01:22:30,061 --> 01:22:30,570
We'd like,

3126
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:30,901
lady,

3127
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:31,410
please wait.

3128
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:32,243
And

3129
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:36,570
you hear horror stories or stories about,

3130
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:36,930
uh,

3131
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:38,400
Thailand in the media and stuff like that.

3132
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,570
There's horror stories everywhere you go.

3133
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:40,220
Yeah.

3134
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:40,980
Yeah.

3135
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,660
I've all the time I spent there.

3136
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:44,670
I've never seen that one
too odd up and really,

3137
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:45,181
no,

3138
01:22:45,181 --> 01:22:45,690
never.

3139
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:46,420
That's amazing.

3140
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:47,550
Even obviously it does happen,

3141
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:48,390
but it happens everywhere.

3142
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:48,871
John Wayne,

3143
01:22:48,871 --> 01:22:49,800
parts of the same thing.

3144
01:22:49,801 --> 01:22:50,571
So it goes over there.

3145
01:22:50,571 --> 01:22:51,450
Is that everyone's lovely.

3146
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:51,851
Yeah.

3147
01:22:51,851 --> 01:22:52,620
Yes.

3148
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:52,870
Yeah.

3149
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:53,500
Yeah.

3150
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:57,630
And he has happened to where I'd been
serious jam and spent time with him.

3151
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,670
He's another one that if
you saw his silhouette,

3152
01:22:59,671 --> 01:23:00,181
you'd absolutely,

3153
01:23:00,181 --> 01:23:00,331
no,

3154
01:23:00,331 --> 01:23:00,860
it was him.

3155
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:01,890
Cause he's so,

3156
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,200
he's got such an odd style of movement.

3157
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:04,710
You know,

3158
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:06,100
like there's a video of him go

3159
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:06,671
to John Wayne,

3160
01:23:06,671 --> 01:23:07,570
pars Instagram.

3161
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,420
Well he's changed his style a lot now
because obviously when he lived in

3162
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:11,020
Thailand,

3163
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,870
he act to fight the thigh where
[inaudible] but like since he's back in

3164
01:23:13,871 --> 01:23:16,300
Australia now and you can adapt to it
all that because he's such a good puncher

3165
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:16,601
as well.

3166
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:17,650
They can fight both ways.

3167
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,470
I'm sure if we ever fought in time
in which you don't need to anymore,

3168
01:23:20,471 --> 01:23:21,041
he's done all that.

3169
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:21,491
But if he did,

3170
01:23:21,491 --> 01:23:22,680
I'm sure we know to go get this.

3171
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,430
Like the way he moves,

3172
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:27,340
it's a hundred percent John Wayne par.

3173
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,130
You know what I'm saying?

3174
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:28,750
Yeah.

3175
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,610
I mean it's very fascinating.

3176
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,473
Like you,

3177
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,130
if you watched him,

3178
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,170
you would know for sure.

3179
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,030
If you didn't see as if
just saw the silhouette,

3180
01:23:37,031 --> 01:23:37,270
you're like,

3181
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:37,580
oh yeah,

3182
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,413
it's chatwing parks.

3183
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:39,353
Definitely.

3184
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:40,513
He's got some engine,

3185
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:44,470
any fighting or getting
to weekend training,

3186
01:23:44,471 --> 01:23:46,950
like fucking savage
knocking people out as well.

3187
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:50,800
And one of the nicest guys you ever
want to meet just couldn't be nicer.

3188
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:51,040
Yeah,

3189
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,610
his wife's nice and and kit.

3190
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:54,890
Have you seen his son
Jesse doing flips and Chet?

3191
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:55,240
Yeah.

3192
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,290
And His dad was a killer.

3193
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:56,500
Yeah.

3194
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:00,700
We made me and a fault on the same show
in August last year and now she come

3195
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:00,911
over,

3196
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:03,310
she beat a British girl and she's,

3197
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:07,560
she thought this my training in my garage
and just watching him kick the bag,

3198
01:24:07,561 --> 01:24:07,841
I was like,

3199
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:08,980
holy fuck.

3200
01:24:08,981 --> 01:24:09,741
That guy kicked him.

3201
01:24:09,741 --> 01:24:10,020
Right.

3202
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:11,590
He comes down a lot of weight as well.

3203
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:12,370
Wp.

3204
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:12,800
Yeah.

3205
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:13,090
Yeah.

3206
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:16,590
I think I've seen him before in him like
85 kilos and then like two free week

3207
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,080
later,

3208
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:17,351
boom.

3209
01:24:17,351 --> 01:24:19,090
72.5 shredded,

3210
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,380
big fan of Australia.

3211
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:21,800
I'm a big fan of Australia.

3212
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,200
They're just nice people now.

3213
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:24,580
The base never been.

3214
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:25,301
It's fucking great.

3215
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:26,290
Everything can kill you though.

3216
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:30,220
Don't leave to the s shock spider snake,

3217
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:31,113
Sasquatch.

3218
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:33,560
Every that begins with s
in Australia will kill you.

3219
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:33,980
Yeah,

3220
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:36,190
and I don't like any of
them things and crocodiles,

3221
01:24:36,191 --> 01:24:39,140
some season tickets.

3222
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:40,013
Fine.

3223
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:41,440
It's a crazy fucking place.

3224
01:24:41,441 --> 01:24:42,161
But you know,

3225
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:42,680
that's a,

3226
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,170
they're pretty close to Thailand,

3227
01:24:44,171 --> 01:24:44,950
right?

3228
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:45,671
Six hour flight.

3229
01:24:45,671 --> 01:24:46,200
It's a slow,

3230
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:46,660
it's on it.

3231
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:47,500
It's like that Spain,

3232
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:47,801
isn't it?

3233
01:24:47,801 --> 01:24:48,440
I mean,

3234
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,320
when you know,

3235
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:52,810
and they go get John Cargo
and package holidays.

3236
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:53,470
He goes to Spain.

3237
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:54,430
Thailand's the DAS.

3238
01:24:54,431 --> 01:24:54,741
Bain.

3239
01:24:54,741 --> 01:24:55,240
Rarely.

3240
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,021
Is that what you guys do?

3241
01:24:56,021 --> 01:24:56,854
You go to Spain.

3242
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:57,963
What are you going to Spain?

3243
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:58,630
Yeah.

3244
01:24:58,630 --> 01:24:58,920
I mean,

3245
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,530

01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:06,821

a Beazer easy.

3252
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:09,913
You guys say it,

3253
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,920
but it's a z.

3254
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:12,970
How's it a thug?

3255
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:17,100
Semite Chavon it's say a band.

3256
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:17,980
Yeah,

3257
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:18,660
and I dunno.

3258
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,890
A beaver is a weird one.

3259
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:21,780
I've heard people say that.

3260
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:22,031
I'm like,

3261
01:25:22,031 --> 01:25:24,100
where are you talking to beat that down.

3262
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:26,530
That's as a Beazer what did you just say?

3263
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,160
I'm too old to go to a bay for now.

3264
01:25:30,161 --> 01:25:30,630
Just below.

3265
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:31,463
You know,

3266
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:32,860
that's a spinning thing,

3267
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:33,131
right?

3268
01:25:33,131 --> 01:25:34,150
Like they use they,

3269
01:25:34,151 --> 01:25:35,500
there's a lot of thug,

3270
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:36,160
right?

3271
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:36,760
Yeah,

3272
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:37,370
yeah.

3273
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:37,720
No.

3274
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:37,901
Yeah,

3275
01:25:37,901 --> 01:25:38,290
true.

3276
01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:38,800
Yeah,

3277
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,101
probably.

3278
01:25:39,101 --> 01:25:40,210
He's so good.

3279
01:25:40,211 --> 01:25:41,320
Fighters from Spain as well.

3280
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:41,921
Fuck yeah.

3281
01:25:41,921 --> 01:25:45,460
Well Europe is always had
like ridiculous Moitai talent.

3282
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,790
The French are outside time and
I think it's probably France.

3283
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:52,930
Then England was that guy
that went to a John Mark.

3284
01:25:52,931 --> 01:25:54,360
What is his name that got Bosky?

3285
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,233
Yes,

3286
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,880
he would grab fire rock when
it came into the MMA champion,

3287
01:25:59,881 --> 01:26:01,990
a bright man and he was that
drunk and fucked him all up.

3288
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:05,150
It was up night drinking at a bar,

3289
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:06,200
like went to a club,

3290
01:26:06,201 --> 01:26:06,801
was drinking,

3291
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:08,030
came and smelled like shit.

3292
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:13,330
Had a fucking like a glass with him of
alcohol like and then put on the pads

3293
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:16,320
like go put on the gloves and
beat the shit out of here.

3294
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:17,500
We're dropping them all at everything,

3295
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:18,440
but you want him around?

3296
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:21,470
I think you're going to rank number one
at Raj and I'm gonna instead him when he

3297
01:26:21,471 --> 01:26:22,970
were fighting until you were like top,

3298
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:24,220
top level and he's promoting,

3299
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:24,801
I'll put it on that.

3300
01:26:24,801 --> 01:26:25,634
Real good shows.

3301
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:26,510
Really good shells.

3302
01:26:26,511 --> 01:26:27,070
Yes.

3303
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:29,810
Crazy thing about him is he
doesn't look like anything.

3304
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:30,470
No,

3305
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:32,390
he never looked in
great shape or anything,

3306
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:35,870
but when he fought pick up fucks people

3307
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:38,241
like that.

3308
01:26:38,241 --> 01:26:42,750
Then he thought he could catch the legs
and sweep the ties and put you asleep

3309
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:45,900
when he John Wayne puppy even
though didn't he standing on.

3310
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,430
What will great about Skrebowski though?

3311
01:26:47,431 --> 01:26:52,100
It used to fight from one 40 up to one
six five it will no wear close for him.

3312
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,110
When you said there's a fire at
one six five you want to do it,

3313
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:54,350
you go.

3314
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:55,070
Yeah,

3315
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:56,240
and then he'd go fight installed.

3316
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,170
You've got fight two weeks,

3317
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:57,961
one 41 route.

3318
01:26:57,961 --> 01:26:59,540
I've got the work done voice.

3319
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:00,140
So yeah,

3320
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:00,860
that's why you were so,

3321
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:01,693
so good.

3322
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:07,150
Now you see a lot of a traditional
karate style in a MMA now where a lot of

3323
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:12,110
these guys are learning how to fight a
different way and throws people off with

3324
01:27:12,111 --> 01:27:14,000
like front leg sidekicks,

3325
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:15,000
wider stance.

3326
01:27:15,001 --> 01:27:17,840
Is that hopping is it wouldn't
have boy who fights like yes,

3327
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:19,670
but you don't see that in more tie.

3328
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:21,050
We'll talk about tension,

3329
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:21,591
tension.

3330
01:27:21,591 --> 01:27:22,490
The kid from Japan,

3331
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:23,320
the new kid,

3332
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,590
he was really in the south part of,

3333
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:26,990
I love how you say his last name,

3334
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:28,700
not so not so Carla.

3335
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:29,420
Yeah,

3336
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:30,650
fucking amazing.

3337
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:33,320
He meets these two actually these Haman,

3338
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,460
Zachary and the and the,

3339
01:27:34,461 --> 01:27:36,180
they won't let him fight the same way.

3340
01:27:36,181 --> 01:27:37,670
It's was just wanting the k one.

3341
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,571
Thank you.

3342
01:27:38,571 --> 01:27:39,570
60 kilos or something.

3343
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:39,960
He's gone on.

3344
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,050
We showed a video of Taco
respiring the other day.

3345
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:44,300
[inaudible] horrible.

3346
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:44,811
Yeah,

3347
01:27:44,811 --> 01:27:45,381
it's horrible.

3348
01:27:45,381 --> 01:27:45,950
But you know,

3349
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:48,110
tension came from originally from karate.

3350
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:49,970
He's doing karate as a kid.

3351
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:50,571
And the thing is,

3352
01:27:50,571 --> 01:27:53,510
he's been knocking out ties as well
because he's unpredictable and you don't

3353
01:27:53,511 --> 01:27:54,950
know what's going so fast as well.

3354
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:58,550
If you can get that balance
and in Muay Thai he,

3355
01:27:58,551 --> 01:27:59,450
he's going to be a bit difficult.

3356
01:27:59,451 --> 01:28:00,284
But for care one,

3357
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:00,590
yeah,

3358
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:01,423
yeah,

3359
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:02,150
yeah.

3360
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:03,540
But he see so many different kids.

3361
01:28:03,541 --> 01:28:06,560
He's Moroccan kids coming from
infusion at the minute that I just,

3362
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,193
you know,

3363
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:09,081
I'm like,

3364
01:28:09,081 --> 01:28:09,441
wow,

3365
01:28:09,441 --> 01:28:10,050
he's amazing.

3366
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:10,491
He's in that.

3367
01:28:10,491 --> 01:28:11,620
He's just lazy kitchens.

3368
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:12,291
Only 18,

3369
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:12,471
right?

3370
01:28:12,471 --> 01:28:13,101
Maybe 19.

3371
01:28:13,101 --> 01:28:14,110
Now we have a CSA.

3372
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:15,520
We have a fire called uh,

3373
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:16,383
uh,

3374
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:17,593
I really,

3375
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:19,010
uh,

3376
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:19,370
from,

3377
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:22,880
from Holland and he's spot and you're
like kid you see in the 18 year old Tyson,

3378
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:28,270
Tyson [inaudible] and just
knocking blocks spark in them.

3379
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:31,380
It's just like there's some
dangerous boys about it.

3380
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:32,780
I'm so glad I'm old.

3381
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:34,580
I am so glad.

3382
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:35,973
The old fella,

3383
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:36,840
it's a,

3384
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:39,320
it is amazing how our combat sports,

3385
01:28:39,321 --> 01:28:40,700
just like any other sport,

3386
01:28:40,701 --> 01:28:41,121
they just,

3387
01:28:41,121 --> 01:28:44,870
the new talent just learns from the old
ways and they get better and better.

3388
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:45,441
I mean,

3389
01:28:45,441 --> 01:28:46,020
it's just there.

3390
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:50,810
There's better talent today and evolving
and evolving all the time in MMA in

3391
01:28:50,811 --> 01:28:52,880
particular because it's
such a recent sport.

3392
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:57,560
I mean Emma amazed really only been around
like popular since the 1993 somewhere

3393
01:28:57,561 --> 01:28:58,220
around there.

3394
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:02,100
So if you look at like
1993 MMA versus thousand 18

3395
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,130
so it's like fucking the
light years difference,

3396
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:07,680
but Moitai it's more incremental.

3397
01:29:07,681 --> 01:29:07,970
Right.

3398
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:08,760
And it's not,

3399
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,400
it's better but not as much better.

3400
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:12,150
No,

3401
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:13,260
that the westerners are,

3402
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:14,240
they're coming.

3403
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,110
Oh so much quicker out there now.

3404
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:17,003
Yeah,

3405
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:20,160
I just think it's the opportunities
that it again fro and now with like the

3406
01:29:20,161 --> 01:29:21,600
likes of Y'all called the likes of,

3407
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:22,111
you know,

3408
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:23,310
all the promotions,

3409
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:24,091
the upbringing.

3410
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:24,924
I'm free.

3411
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:28,680
I know we've just got some really
good like Daniel McGowan and his last

3412
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:31,740
performance Efr and he's east
going to go and live in patching.

3413
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:33,240
Dino is sponsored by them.

3414
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,040
He was absolutely superb.

3415
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:35,943
We've got some,

3416
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,510
I'm very proud of our country
when it comes to my tie.

3417
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,141
I'm very,

3418
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:43,680
very proud of it because
I've been in the days where,

3419
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:45,000
even before Liam,

3420
01:29:45,001 --> 01:29:46,500
I've been up 34 years,

3421
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:47,430
I've been involved in it.

3422
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,690
And just seeing ties come over and
beat the shit out of people like that.

3423
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:53,660
Oh fuck.

3424
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:54,650
And the game grew up.

3425
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:55,553
I love it.

3426
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:57,960
The likes of this one here
in the likes of other people,

3427
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:58,260
uh,

3428
01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:59,640
have given us a better chance.

3429
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:00,331
You know,

3430
01:30:00,331 --> 01:30:01,101
so it's the fights.

3431
01:30:01,101 --> 01:30:06,101
Some all competitive and ties are starting
to train the train folium like they

3432
01:30:06,181 --> 01:30:06,991
trained for him.

3433
01:30:06,991 --> 01:30:10,700
Like I know that my life
pat trains solidly for him
when he fought him on that.

3434
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:10,961
Yeah.

3435
01:30:10,961 --> 01:30:11,571
It never did.

3436
01:30:11,571 --> 01:30:13,120
It never train trains one week for a fact.

3437
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:13,770
The,

3438
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:14,601
you were telling me before,

3439
01:30:14,601 --> 01:30:17,180
I've trained two months for
this health trend to mumps.

3440
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:18,411
Where'd you find him?

3441
01:30:18,411 --> 01:30:19,490
On what car lion fight.

3442
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:20,570
It was the line of Fire Arb.

3443
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:21,650
You won't be in my points on that.

3444
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:22,190
Yeah.

3445
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:22,341
Oh,

3446
01:30:22,341 --> 01:30:23,030
I saw that fight.

3447
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:23,300
Yeah,

3448
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:24,133
that was fun.

3449
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:25,990
It was good fight sweeping him.

3450
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:26,983
Yeah,

3451
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:27,471
that was good.

3452
01:30:27,471 --> 01:30:27,731
Fine.

3453
01:30:27,731 --> 01:30:28,071
One judge.

3454
01:30:28,071 --> 01:30:28,910
Give it fucking 50,

3455
01:30:28,911 --> 01:30:29,750
46 to him.

3456
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,011
Really?

3457
01:30:31,011 --> 01:30:31,560
Yeah.

3458
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,000
It was at the late bird.

3459
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:38,030
So lion fight hasn't had
a fight in a long time.

3460
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:38,390
I'm a,

3461
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:40,580
I haven't heard anything that they
didn't used to be with access TV,

3462
01:30:40,581 --> 01:30:41,930
but then I don't think they are anymore

3463
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:46,970
that working with the MTG P it's run by
a Karen catalogs with the the one the

3464
01:30:46,990 --> 01:30:47,823
empty.

3465
01:30:49,730 --> 01:30:50,530
Yeah.

3466
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:51,840
Did they have an American outlets?

3467
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:53,740
I actually don't know.

3468
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:54,881
So fuck,

3469
01:30:54,881 --> 01:30:56,120
they need something in America.

3470
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,960
So what big one as well
at one point they were,

3471
01:30:58,961 --> 01:31:01,990
you know like access TV is mark
Cuban's network and it's a,

3472
01:31:01,991 --> 01:31:03,430
they've got a lot of great fights on it.

3473
01:31:03,450 --> 01:31:04,120
It's they,

3474
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:09,120
they've always had like a real good
strong Moitai and combat sports elder

3475
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:09,730
Jacada.

3476
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:10,210
Yeah.

3477
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:11,260
And while they have,

3478
01:31:11,261 --> 01:31:11,530
um,

3479
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:14,380
pat millages is doing commentary
for MMA this weekend with that,

3480
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:16,860
but it's just they're missing the,

3481
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:17,560
you know,

3482
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:22,540
the wide distribution of like a fox or
fs one or things that have gotten the UFC

3483
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:23,374
so popular.

3484
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:24,100
Yeah,

3485
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:24,461
they've got,

3486
01:31:24,461 --> 01:31:25,240
um,

3487
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:26,710
they've got to standout fighters as well.

3488
01:31:26,711 --> 01:31:26,951
Really,

3489
01:31:26,951 --> 01:31:29,650
I think the need mohs timeout fight is
they get their fight is like on big show.

3490
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:30,311
The broaden that they've got.

3491
01:31:30,311 --> 01:31:31,144
Kevin Ross,

3492
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:32,680
obviously the shielding as well,

3493
01:31:32,681 --> 01:31:37,000
but he's more MMA in k one and Anjan
topic and they are like the two that

3494
01:31:37,001 --> 01:31:38,860
everyone says about the
normally tie in America,

3495
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:39,161
right.

3496
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:40,320
Ross topic there,

3497
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:41,210
the tour to come straight up,

3498
01:31:41,230 --> 01:31:42,200
but still Schilling is a,

3499
01:31:42,201 --> 01:31:44,470
they're all fighting Beltour now toxic.

3500
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:46,260
That's jumping,

3501
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:47,863
which is great.

3502
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:48,570
It's great.

3503
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:50,170
I'm a big fan of Bela Tarr kickboxing,

3504
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:50,501
but again,

3505
01:31:50,501 --> 01:31:51,960
it's kickboxing and stumbled on top.

3506
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,650
I prefer to work Kevin Fight.

3507
01:31:53,651 --> 01:31:54,710
Moitai could he cook?

3508
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,250
He likes to go on a wall,

3509
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,840
so it's exciting to watch him do that.

3510
01:31:59,080 --> 01:31:59,410
Yeah.

3511
01:31:59,410 --> 01:31:59,630
Okay.

3512
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:01,600
Won't let you say it limits what?

3513
01:32:01,601 --> 01:32:02,434
A Muay Thai fighter.

3514
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:03,933
Yes.

3515
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:07,790
An English girl called [inaudible]
Barlow is Enfusion champion as well,

3516
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:09,130
and she's a lion fight.

3517
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:09,973
Muy Thai champion.

3518
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:10,850
She's that.

3519
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:11,990
She's won 10 world titles.

3520
01:32:11,991 --> 01:32:15,500
He is at 140 fights and she
fighting since she was four.

3521
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:16,853
What?

3522
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:17,580
Yeah,

3523
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:17,761
yeah.

3524
01:32:17,761 --> 01:32:17,940
The,

3525
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:18,141
yeah.

3526
01:32:18,141 --> 01:32:21,800
She's from DSRC issue in a train
by that man Barlow of clip clipper,

3527
01:32:21,801 --> 01:32:23,060
her offering quality.

3528
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:26,240
Have you seen it when she kicked
and she kicked 10 times girl,

3529
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:28,010
nine times in a row go Bam,

3530
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:28,260
Bam,

3531
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:28,550
Bam,

3532
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:29,383
Bam.

3533
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:30,680
Right,

3534
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:31,040
right,

3535
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:31,370
right.

3536
01:32:31,370 --> 01:32:32,203
What is her name?

3537
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:33,530
Mri in particular.

3538
01:32:33,531 --> 01:32:34,364
Barlow.

3539
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:35,593
Spell that.

3540
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:36,180
Uh,

3541
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:36,820
um,

3542
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:38,660
MRI is a I.

3543
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:40,070
M a n like Iman.

3544
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:41,270
Marlo.

3545
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:42,103
Yeah.

3546
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:45,500
I'm on Barlow for left door

3547
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,270
shifts your battery if you
see her when she sees me.

3548
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:50,790
But uh,

3549
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:51,021
yeah,

3550
01:32:51,021 --> 01:32:52,760
she's a great fighter and you know,

3551
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:53,090
in,

3552
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:53,570
uh,

3553
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:54,560
where's your accent?

3554
01:32:54,561 --> 01:32:55,280
You guys,

3555
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,330
is this Liverpool?

3556
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:57,530
I live in Liverpool,

3557
01:32:57,531 --> 01:32:58,790
but I'm originally from Manchester.

3558
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:02,140
So what does the difference to
your accent and Olivia Talk?

3559
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:03,610
Very posh compared to deliver it.

3560
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:04,523
You tasteless.

3561
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,100
Scousers talk like that.

3562
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:07,220
He talked like,

3563
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:08,053
wait,

3564
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:08,983
it's her luck.

3565
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:09,770
My wife,

3566
01:33:09,770 --> 01:33:10,940
my wife Lisa scale.

3567
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:11,783
So yeah.

3568
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:13,980
Is this the one?

3569
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:14,400
Yeah,

3570
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,233
it's not the fire.

3571
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:17,313
Um,

3572
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:18,233
that's serious.

3573
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:19,081
I think.

3574
01:33:19,081 --> 01:33:20,040
Keeps Marina's waiver.

3575
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:23,730
The bow head kick to the
body and then to the head.

3576
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:24,653
Damn.

3577
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:25,950
Fuck.

3578
01:33:26,610 --> 01:33:26,731
Yeah.

3579
01:33:26,731 --> 01:33:27,870
That's the thing about legs,

3580
01:33:27,871 --> 01:33:28,470
man.

3581
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:29,010
I mean,

3582
01:33:29,010 --> 01:33:33,370
every woman that weighs 130 pounds is
carrying 130 pounds around all day with

3583
01:33:33,371 --> 01:33:34,200
their legs.

3584
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,820
Try walking around in your hands all day.

3585
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:36,250
Yeah.

3586
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:37,083
Yeah.

3587
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:38,900
Women can knock you the fuck out.

3588
01:33:39,630 --> 01:33:40,980
Then when she wished she had one 15.

3589
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:41,590
Yeah,

3590
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:42,423
she's only small.

3591
01:33:42,430 --> 01:33:44,860
She sounds really nice.

3592
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:45,530
He's like,

3593
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:45,860
oh no.

3594
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:48,560
Dot though for a girl
to have 100 plus fights.

3595
01:33:48,561 --> 01:33:49,310
He's,

3596
01:33:49,310 --> 01:33:50,970
it's ridiculous really
when you think about it.

3597
01:33:50,971 --> 01:33:52,940
But she's still smashing
it and she's doing,

3598
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:53,220
she is,

3599
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:54,360
she's one about 95,

3600
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:55,470
96%.

3601
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:55,740
Yeah.

3602
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:56,573
She asked you,

3603
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,131
how old are you now,

3604
01:33:58,131 --> 01:33:58,590
Liam?

3605
01:33:58,590 --> 01:33:59,423
30 too.

3606
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:00,870
So you're still in your prime right now?

3607
01:34:00,871 --> 01:34:01,501
I would think so.

3608
01:34:01,501 --> 01:34:01,860
Again.

3609
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:02,161
I mean,

3610
01:34:02,161 --> 01:34:02,994
um,

3611
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:04,860
my last 10 fights,

3612
01:34:04,861 --> 01:34:06,260
I've probably one eight.

3613
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:06,900
Um,

3614
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:09,450
the two losses have been on
points one to Fabio pinker,

3615
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:10,500
top level operator,

3616
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:11,790
um,

3617
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:14,700
and another one in front of a
French boy rub off on points.

3618
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,590
But all my fights in between that,

3619
01:34:16,591 --> 01:34:17,331
I've even knocked him out.

3620
01:34:17,331 --> 01:34:17,941
I'll stop them.

3621
01:34:17,941 --> 01:34:18,350
And I've,

3622
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:19,440
I feel when I'm trading,

3623
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:21,630
I don't want to fight and
I feel like I'm in prime.

3624
01:34:21,631 --> 01:34:22,740
I feel like I'm stronger than ever.

3625
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,230
I feel like I'm faster than ever and
sharp or whenever I've still got the

3626
01:34:25,231 --> 01:34:25,900
hunger.

3627
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:26,733
Um,

3628
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,370
I'm still really wanting
to fight all the time.

3629
01:34:29,371 --> 01:34:32,340
We saw all I'm concentrating on
as well as training overs as well.

3630
01:34:32,341 --> 01:34:34,620
But my sole intention is still,

3631
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:35,550
I've still got goals.

3632
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:36,631
That's the thing.

3633
01:34:36,631 --> 01:34:38,280
Like I know I've had a
lot of fights and stuff,

3634
01:34:38,281 --> 01:34:40,830
but I've still got goals that I
want to achieve and I want to do.

3635
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:41,730
And I'm like what are the,

3636
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:42,690
um,

3637
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:46,350
well I want to WBC title in 2015 and um,

3638
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:48,150
you can see I've got a metal plate in me.

3639
01:34:48,151 --> 01:34:48,511
I'm there,

3640
01:34:48,511 --> 01:34:52,240
I brought my hand and they didn't even
give me a chance to strip me of the belt

3641
01:34:52,241 --> 01:34:52,601
straight away.

3642
01:34:52,601 --> 01:34:53,401
It didn't give me chance to say,

3643
01:34:53,401 --> 01:34:53,641
right,

3644
01:34:53,641 --> 01:34:54,840
we're a few months defense.

3645
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:58,190
We can defend it then just stripped me
of it and now other people have won it

3646
01:34:58,191 --> 01:34:59,000
and stuff.

3647
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,860
So I want to win that belt buck.

3648
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:01,753
And I've let

3649
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:03,951
in your hand,

3650
01:35:03,951 --> 01:35:04,731
they just stripped you.

3651
01:35:04,731 --> 01:35:05,960
You had to just took it off my hair.

3652
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:06,860
Why they do that?

3653
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:07,341
I don't know.

3654
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:09,440
I think they wanted the French
boy why we went to defend against,

3655
01:35:09,441 --> 01:35:10,041
to fight for it.

3656
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:10,821
Cause it was in front.

3657
01:35:10,821 --> 01:35:13,820
So they'll let him fight for
it and he won it and stuff.

3658
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:16,010
But now I think the title is vacant.

3659
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:17,030
Oh well something.

3660
01:35:17,031 --> 01:35:18,080
I think the champions moved away.

3661
01:35:18,081 --> 01:35:19,070
It's become vacant again.

3662
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:20,420
I probably shouldn't be saying this,

3663
01:35:20,421 --> 01:35:23,360
but I am fighting for it later
on in the year against a real,

3664
01:35:23,361 --> 01:35:25,670
real strong fire as well.

3665
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:26,160
Um,

3666
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:26,570
I,

3667
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:27,530
I don't think he's been released.

3668
01:35:27,531 --> 01:35:28,281
I'm not last say,

3669
01:35:28,281 --> 01:35:31,850
I don't think he's going to be probably
one of biggest vice Britain seen in a

3670
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:32,660
long time.

3671
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:35,630
So obviously I've got that
looking forward to in July,

3672
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:36,681
massive,

3673
01:35:36,681 --> 01:35:37,011
massive.

3674
01:35:37,011 --> 01:35:38,750
I'm defending my UK number one spot.

3675
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,600
I've been looking
forward to this for ages.

3676
01:35:41,601 --> 01:35:44,930
I've been number one in new care for
about 13 years and that was a lot of talk

3677
01:35:44,931 --> 01:35:47,180
about a Guy Charlie p as
number two in the rankings.

3678
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:48,231
Climbed his way up.

3679
01:35:48,231 --> 01:35:49,730
I had some big wins and he shot,

3680
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:51,350
he's got the old country divided.

3681
01:35:51,351 --> 01:35:52,190
It's not fee south.

3682
01:35:52,191 --> 01:35:53,024
I'm from Leeds,

3683
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:54,043
which is up north.

3684
01:35:54,230 --> 01:35:55,011
He's from London,

3685
01:35:55,011 --> 01:35:55,791
which is down south.

3686
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:57,020
He's got the country divided.

3687
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:57,800
Um,

3688
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:58,640
he's R and d shops.

3689
01:35:58,650 --> 01:35:59,900
I'm really looking forward to that.

3690
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,340
That's a bit of a grudge match.

3691
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:02,211
Yeah,

3692
01:36:02,211 --> 01:36:05,100
you could say it not dark
and going on a little bit.

3693
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:05,961
A little bit.

3694
01:36:05,961 --> 01:36:06,794
A little bit.

3695
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:07,910
I'm fucking useless.

3696
01:36:07,911 --> 01:36:08,570
It shits well.

3697
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:09,111
I like it.

3698
01:36:09,111 --> 01:36:10,040
Throw an insole out there.

3699
01:36:10,041 --> 01:36:11,090
They just don't even make no sense.

3700
01:36:11,091 --> 01:36:11,924
And I got,

3701
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:12,611
what the fuck am,

3702
01:36:12,611 --> 01:36:13,444
I just don't know.

3703
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,650
I just look a complete idiot.

3704
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:17,831
Funny marry you.

3705
01:36:17,831 --> 01:36:18,820
They're good at that shit or you.

3706
01:36:18,821 --> 01:36:19,600
Yay.

3707
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,040
Connor's got a gift.

3708
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:22,600
You know Conor McGregor

3709
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,630
good at it as well.

3710
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:25,710
Leo?

3711
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:26,580
I mentioned earlier.

3712
01:36:26,581 --> 01:36:27,420
He's good at he's,

3713
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:28,980
I have no fucking useless.

3714
01:36:28,981 --> 01:36:30,300
So as keep my mouth shut.

3715
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:34,420
So where's the best way that
most people can watch you fight?

3716
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,710
Like a lot of these fights,

3717
01:36:35,711 --> 01:36:38,260
you're going to have to watch
him after the fact in America,

3718
01:36:38,261 --> 01:36:38,970
right?

3719
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:39,400
Um,

3720
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:40,120
yeah.

3721
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:43,840
Most of them do come straight on
youtube or some of the cow puts them on.

3722
01:36:43,870 --> 01:36:45,310
They put them on their youtube channels.

3723
01:36:45,370 --> 01:36:46,450
And is it just your cow?

3724
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:47,370
Why?

3725
01:36:47,370 --> 01:36:50,010
Oh K K A.

3726
01:36:50,010 --> 01:36:50,640
Oh yeah.

3727
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:51,630
I mean that's,

3728
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:54,010
that's the one that Liam
fights on this a lot.

3729
01:36:54,670 --> 01:36:55,350
I comment.

3730
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:56,183
Say on them a lot,

3731
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:57,910
which are very privileged to do.

3732
01:36:57,911 --> 01:36:58,331
But yeah,

3733
01:36:58,331 --> 01:37:01,820
living this other outlets you'd be
typing laymen in Youtube will have it.

3734
01:37:01,821 --> 01:37:02,440
They can watch him.

3735
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:05,410
I love the way you commentate cause you
always say something and you say isn't

3736
01:37:05,411 --> 01:37:06,244
he?

3737
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:07,391
He's winning.

3738
01:37:07,391 --> 01:37:08,650
Isn't he beautiful?

3739
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:12,580
Like that's an English thing man.

3740
01:37:12,581 --> 01:37:16,330
You like you like you say something but
then you also want everybody to agree

3741
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:17,140
with you I think.

3742
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:17,973
I think it's kind of a,

3743
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:22,270
I'm quarter Welsh and the whilst do
that so maybe that's a DNA thing.

3744
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:24,490
It all the time I say,

3745
01:37:24,491 --> 01:37:28,960
Oh you good in one way you're
[inaudible] all the time.

3746
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:29,803
I've got that one.

3747
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:30,180
Just did.

3748
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:32,050
We knew out loud why.

3749
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:33,910
Notice that when I was in England.

3750
01:37:33,911 --> 01:37:37,360
Just having conversations with people
that that's like a speech pattern that

3751
01:37:37,361 --> 01:37:40,080
people do it where I
learn something everyday.

3752
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:42,430
I first heard you when you were doing,

3753
01:37:42,431 --> 01:37:44,080
it's showtime when
you're doing commentary.

3754
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:45,011
I remember hearing that,

3755
01:37:45,011 --> 01:37:46,060
like this guy always does that.

3756
01:37:46,061 --> 01:37:47,920
And he says that after some of the,

3757
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:48,761
some of the things,

3758
01:37:48,761 --> 01:37:49,594
I mean there was,

3759
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:54,300
there was one fight where
Mohammed CML and a Ma sub,

3760
01:37:54,301 --> 01:37:58,650
I'm Ronnie and I got fucking bananas
and looking back at it now I'm thinking,

3761
01:37:58,651 --> 01:38:00,450
but they loved it and so do yours.

3762
01:38:00,451 --> 01:38:02,430
We liked who was screaming like pitch

3763
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:05,160
squeaky voice.

3764
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:06,540
It makes the fight exciting

3765
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,880
then Kabil so I spend that
much time in Holland anyway.

3766
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:12,714
But uh,

3767
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:13,350
yeah,

3768
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:14,220
so thanks for that.

3769
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,510
A real pioneers right when it comes
to like expanding into more Thai and

3770
01:38:18,511 --> 01:38:19,344
kickboxing.

3771
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:19,551
Wow.

3772
01:38:19,551 --> 01:38:20,311
How did that happen?

3773
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,270
Like the Dutch,

3774
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,580
it was a pure Kachin base originally,

3775
01:38:23,581 --> 01:38:23,761
right?

3776
01:38:23,761 --> 01:38:24,240
Yeah.

3777
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:24,511
I mean,

3778
01:38:24,511 --> 01:38:26,330
you've got to thank people like Johan Vos,

3779
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:26,910

3780
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:27,710
Tom Herink,

3781
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:28,450

3782
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:29,410
and uh,

3783
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:30,793
young Plas,

3784
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:32,200
Vuss trained,

3785
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:32,890
uh,

3786
01:38:32,890 --> 01:38:36,500
Ivan hyppolite enesto host a Shakuri Kid,

3787
01:38:36,501 --> 01:38:37,560
dad batter from the beginning,

3788
01:38:37,561 --> 01:38:38,220
prs,

3789
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:38,930
et cetera.

3790
01:38:38,930 --> 01:38:39,061
And,

3791
01:38:39,061 --> 01:38:39,820
and they,

3792
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:43,890
the pioneers and then what now they've
got so many good gyms coming through and

3793
01:38:43,891 --> 01:38:46,040
so many kids that they had,

3794
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,700
it's like the fight,

3795
01:38:47,701 --> 01:38:49,920
like you stole something from them.

3796
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:52,620
They just blitzkrieg each other.

3797
01:38:52,621 --> 01:38:55,020
And the Thai version of
the ties in Thailand.

3798
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:56,133
Moroccans,

3799
01:38:56,570 --> 01:38:57,690
they're like NK one there.

3800
01:38:57,691 --> 01:38:58,490
That version,

3801
01:38:58,490 --> 01:38:59,323
the soul out to beat.

3802
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:02,450
I know Liam Liam loves
Moitai and you know,

3803
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:05,100
I try and talk to Leah about
kickbox and he just gets annoyed.

3804
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,120
But um,

3805
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:06,670
it's true though.

3806
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:08,080
It like,

3807
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:11,970
it just points out you
don't watch kickboxing.

3808
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:12,451
I will.

3809
01:39:12,451 --> 01:39:12,901
If it had been,

3810
01:39:12,901 --> 01:39:13,141
he says,

3811
01:39:13,141 --> 01:39:14,200
watch this fight is amazing.

3812
01:39:14,201 --> 01:39:14,611
I watch it.

3813
01:39:14,611 --> 01:39:15,101
I won't go out.

3814
01:39:15,101 --> 01:39:15,934
I'm aware to watch it.

3815
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:16,430
I don't know.

3816
01:39:16,430 --> 01:39:18,240
I just thought this dog
isn't that interesting.

3817
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:21,720
He likes what he likes and that's it.

3818
01:39:21,721 --> 01:39:22,270
You know,

3819
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:24,720
that's how there's a big
thing with a lot of Americans,

3820
01:39:24,721 --> 01:39:24,931
you know,

3821
01:39:24,931 --> 01:39:26,010
when it comes to like,

3822
01:39:26,011 --> 01:39:29,910
I've tried to show American fight fans
Moitai even like good buddies of mine.

3823
01:39:29,911 --> 01:39:30,744
Like,

3824
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:32,970
how the fuck can you not like this?

3825
01:39:32,990 --> 01:39:33,230
Yeah.

3826
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:34,540
It's what people like.

3827
01:39:34,541 --> 01:39:35,220
And he's like,

3828
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,140
I used to like watch boxing,

3829
01:39:37,141 --> 01:39:38,070
but now I've been watching,

3830
01:39:38,071 --> 01:39:38,904
uh,

3831
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:40,920
like movement specialists,

3832
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:41,280
you know,

3833
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,960
I've been doing all
that movement and stuff.

3834
01:39:42,961 --> 01:39:44,420
I've started doing it and especially

3835
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:49,810
I trained with a guy called dom met and
now and he's a student of Edo puts up

3836
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:54,300
and I like watching that and Simon
self just sat there watching man in men

3837
01:39:54,301 --> 01:39:55,630
swinging it around and rings for,

3838
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:56,610
you know what that's called?

3839
01:39:56,611 --> 01:39:58,530
It's called mental pause ball.

3840
01:39:58,640 --> 01:39:59,630
Certain staff what?

3841
01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:02,190
That's definitely definitely true.

3842
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:07,700
I worked with done not long buck and
some of the stuff he does is amazing from

3843
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:08,940
way Tyler,

3844
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:11,130
obviously you hip flexor and stuff
that are working all the time.

3845
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:13,650
Some of the like the different
stuff that we're doing always.

3846
01:40:13,651 --> 01:40:14,490
I get really tight run.

3847
01:40:14,491 --> 01:40:15,071
We have some stuff on.

3848
01:40:15,071 --> 01:40:16,320
I'm kicking all the time and not,

3849
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:18,820
some of the stuff that he showed me
and we worked with were unbelievable.

3850
01:40:18,821 --> 01:40:20,640
I felt so much looser
and we love that guy.

3851
01:40:20,641 --> 01:40:21,120
Yeah.

3852
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,320
Have you ever done any yoga?

3853
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:23,190
No.

3854
01:40:23,190 --> 01:40:25,260
I did a hot yoga once and I nearly died,

3855
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:30,060
so I'll do that one again.

3856
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:31,170
I should do it to be fair,

3857
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:35,120
but I think now that I've found done and
all the different stuff that he showed

3858
01:40:35,121 --> 01:40:35,221
me,

3859
01:40:35,221 --> 01:40:35,461
I think,

3860
01:40:35,461 --> 01:40:36,770
no blah blah.

3861
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:37,710
It can replace any,

3862
01:40:37,711 --> 01:40:40,080
any sort of yoga I shouldn't be doing
because this stuff is is amazing.

3863
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:44,000
I think you would be a good compliment
to your style cause their stylists.

3864
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:45,380
Fuck yeah,

3865
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:50,130
you're so tense and powerful that I would
think that like maybe that will open

3866
01:40:50,131 --> 01:40:52,890
you up a little bit of
that stuff that Dan does.

3867
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:53,871
Does he like,

3868
01:40:53,871 --> 01:40:55,720
he's opening using
different joints and stuff.

3869
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:59,440
Putting me in positions that I'm not
used to and three Farah is is odd,

3870
01:40:59,441 --> 01:41:01,180
but after you've done it and you,

3871
01:41:01,181 --> 01:41:02,410
after you've done the workout and stuff,

3872
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:03,311
he's join.

3873
01:41:03,311 --> 01:41:03,850
Yeah.

3874
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:06,130
You just feel loose and he feel amazing.

3875
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:06,890
It's brilliant.

3876
01:41:06,890 --> 01:41:07,300
It really,

3877
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:07,990
very good

3878
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:10,210
sell every Wednesday morning
and I don't want to go,

3879
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:11,530
I'll fucking tell you the truth.

3880
01:41:11,531 --> 01:41:13,480
I'm driving down that
it's an hour away from me.

3881
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:16,660
I'm thinking fuck this and
then I get there and it's just,

3882
01:41:17,690 --> 01:41:18,431
it's just a very,

3883
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:18,990
very special.

3884
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:20,760
How illegal is weed in England?

3885
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:23,000
I'm not in sweat.

3886
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:23,220
Me.

3887
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:24,053
Listen Bro,

3888
01:41:24,150 --> 01:41:27,250
take two solid hits and
then go to yoga class.

3889
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:30,480
It's on solid hit from behind in run
back on myself or I'm telling you,

3890
01:41:30,481 --> 01:41:34,920
it's not for me to see American wheat
get ahold of some of this California shit

3891
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:39,000
orbit serious two hits and
then go to a yoga class.

3892
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:40,530
It's like you're on a journey.

3893
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:41,281
You're like,

3894
01:41:41,281 --> 01:41:43,230
you get out of their hour and a half late,

3895
01:41:43,231 --> 01:41:45,450
it's perfect cause an hour
and a half into the sweating,

3896
01:41:45,690 --> 01:41:47,600
the pots worn off and you're like,

3897
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:48,301
you come back down.

3898
01:41:48,301 --> 01:41:49,140
We'll put in the middle of it.

3899
01:41:49,141 --> 01:41:51,870
You feel like the world's going to end
any second now and in the middle of the

3900
01:41:51,871 --> 01:41:52,210
class,

3901
01:41:52,210 --> 01:41:53,970
like there's no way this
could be sustainable.

3902
01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:56,070
There's no way I'm not going to survive.

3903
01:41:56,250 --> 01:41:59,330
Did the whole way you just think about
everything that's going on up in Tracy.

3904
01:41:59,340 --> 01:41:59,510
Again,

3905
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:00,970
I'm a Joe will like a house on fire.

3906
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:02,793
My Dad,

3907
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:04,861
not me.

3908
01:42:04,861 --> 01:42:05,620
I can't do it.

3909
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:06,480
Don't agree with me.

3910
01:42:06,510 --> 01:42:07,470
I love it for Yoga.

3911
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:07,910
Small.

3912
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:10,560
My favorite things ever take
two hits and go to yoga class.

3913
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:11,491
When you stone,

3914
01:42:11,491 --> 01:42:13,170
you can't not be on stone quick.

3915
01:42:13,171 --> 01:42:13,680
He just like,

3916
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:14,480
Oh shit.

3917
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:15,313
Tomorrow.

3918
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:15,661
No,

3919
01:42:15,661 --> 01:42:16,530
there's nowhere enough.

3920
01:42:16,531 --> 01:42:16,910
Quick.

3921
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:17,520
Yeah.

3922
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:18,660
Caffeine helps a little bit.

3923
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:19,220
Coffee.

3924
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:20,910
I remember Jordan give
me a drop of cannabis,

3925
01:42:20,911 --> 01:42:21,421
I will be fine.

3926
01:42:21,421 --> 01:42:24,630
I like melted into we for for about six
hours in a conch move and I'm thinking

3927
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:25,550
I'm dead.

3928
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:25,981
I'm Sam,

3929
01:42:25,981 --> 01:42:26,400
I'm doing it.

3930
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,233
Yeah.

3931
01:42:27,390 --> 01:42:27,870
This time,

3932
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:29,220
last time I was a a high at someone,

3933
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:33,570
I add some cannabis oil and I was sat
there watching TV and then I was like

3934
01:42:33,571 --> 01:42:34,890
fucking hell of those mine.

3935
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:38,850
And then they got the remote control
from the TV and this guy was getting a

3936
01:42:38,851 --> 01:42:40,860
little older and I turned
him over and I went,

3937
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:41,843
Huh.

3938
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:43,860
To me fucking self.

3939
01:42:43,861 --> 01:42:44,880
And then I knew for not,

3940
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,710
it's not for you to as well.

3941
01:42:46,711 --> 01:42:48,450
It's just one of those
things like anything else,

3942
01:42:48,451 --> 01:42:50,040
you've got to ease into it.

3943
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:50,300
You know what,

3944
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:51,620
I don't understand what you're saying.

3945
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:52,980
Yeah.

3946
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:54,930
I'd like that for just relaxation,

3947
01:42:54,931 --> 01:42:55,651
reflection,

3948
01:42:55,651 --> 01:42:56,010
you know?

3949
01:42:56,010 --> 01:42:56,220
Yeah.

3950
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:59,420
I think it's also great for like
pain management and like just,

3951
01:42:59,490 --> 01:42:59,761
you know,

3952
01:42:59,761 --> 01:43:00,840
after you're done training,

3953
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:01,591
everything's sore.

3954
01:43:01,591 --> 01:43:02,221
Your shoulders,

3955
01:43:02,221 --> 01:43:03,054
your elbows.

3956
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:03,933
Well my mom and dad,

3957
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:04,800
they both love it,

3958
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,050
but I've just never been able to me.

3959
01:43:06,051 --> 01:43:09,180
And what I tried to drag before and I
nearly had the fucking paranoid Taco.

3960
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:09,470
Yeah.

3961
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:11,550
Cause he had to go hide to dig a little.

3962
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:12,330
Yes.

3963
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:14,520
But those are those type of guy
that I'm all on north India.

3964
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:14,821
I mean,

3965
01:43:14,821 --> 01:43:15,460
so yeah,

3966
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:20,460
I'm sure every aspect of your approach
where you approach Moitai that could be a

3967
01:43:20,461 --> 01:43:24,050
real fucking child in
Potsdam as all in Potsdam.

3968
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:24,250
Never.

3969
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:24,661
Diana said,

3970
01:43:24,661 --> 01:43:24,871
right.

3971
01:43:24,871 --> 01:43:26,940
Just just bang.

3972
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:27,853
Not just that,

3973
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:30,073
just,

3974
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:30,930
okay.

3975
01:43:30,930 --> 01:43:31,451
Just Bang.

3976
01:43:31,451 --> 01:43:31,660
Get that.

3977
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:34,170
So you're trying to like get
him to settle down and he yeah,

3978
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:36,140
no,

3979
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:36,470
no.

3980
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:39,490
Where near the level of his
coach are just old parts in the,

3981
01:43:39,491 --> 01:43:39,910
in the,

3982
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:40,990
in the way the icon.

3983
01:43:40,991 --> 01:43:45,750
I'm more of a boxing holding pads for
boxing because he's no way he's evil paths

3984
01:43:45,751 --> 01:43:48,310
for Jordan Watson and
I am not holding paths.

3985
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,470
I'm not very experienced in that.

3986
01:43:49,471 --> 01:43:49,870
Again,

3987
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:52,090
I'm an old man and I'm not
old in Potsdam and John

3988
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:53,440
and get twice as out as me as well.

3989
01:43:53,441 --> 01:43:56,930
He's kicks up solutely redeem it probably
breaks straight through that machine

3990
01:43:56,931 --> 01:43:57,190
out there.

3991
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:57,490
Yeah,

3992
01:43:57,490 --> 01:44:00,650
it's an absolute nightmare
holding parts for him,

3993
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:01,651
I'm sure.

3994
01:44:01,651 --> 01:44:01,820
Yeah.

3995
01:44:01,820 --> 01:44:02,653
I've seen him fight.

3996
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:04,490
I saw him fight Georgio too.

3997
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:05,650
Got caught with that critic.

3998
01:44:06,210 --> 01:44:06,730
Look,

3999
01:44:06,730 --> 01:44:11,730
it was a fatal mistake that
[inaudible] has got such good eyesight.

4000
01:44:12,110 --> 01:44:12,591
The East,

4001
01:44:12,591 --> 01:44:13,424
just

4002
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:16,513
before it got off,

4003
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:18,973
50 years ago,

4004
01:44:19,190 --> 01:44:19,671
this kid,

4005
01:44:19,671 --> 01:44:20,061
this kid,

4006
01:44:20,061 --> 01:44:20,630
this kid,

4007
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:24,350
my box of fighting and we went in and
we heard about this kid geology patrol.

4008
01:44:24,351 --> 01:44:24,741
She was like,

4009
01:44:24,741 --> 01:44:25,130
right,

4010
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:25,410
whatever.

4011
01:44:25,410 --> 01:44:25,731
Yes,

4012
01:44:25,731 --> 01:44:26,541
he's on beat and Blah,

4013
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:26,691
blah,

4014
01:44:26,691 --> 01:44:26,931
blah.

4015
01:44:26,931 --> 01:44:27,221
Fuck off,

4016
01:44:27,221 --> 01:44:27,870
fuck off.

4017
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:28,701
They just trying to scare you.

4018
01:44:28,701 --> 01:44:29,510
Don't worry.

4019
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:30,440
My box went out.

4020
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:31,670
He was a great fighter himself.

4021
01:44:31,671 --> 01:44:32,081
Rick Barn,

4022
01:44:32,081 --> 01:44:32,780
a lovely kid,

4023
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:35,660
got his own gym and a fall block by Bam.

4024
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:36,380
Slip,

4025
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:37,400
got cough drops,

4026
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:38,081
body shot,

4027
01:44:38,081 --> 01:44:38,870
and then he got up again.

4028
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:39,411
Body shot,

4029
01:44:39,411 --> 01:44:39,861
leg kick,

4030
01:44:39,861 --> 01:44:40,460
banged,

4031
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:41,300
and he'd come back and he said,

4032
01:44:41,301 --> 01:44:42,590
I call it unethical to them that I said,

4033
01:44:42,591 --> 01:44:43,424
you fucking couldn't.

4034
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:45,130
I'll tell you what the
most of this kid special,

4035
01:44:45,131 --> 01:44:46,280
impressive thing about him as well.

4036
01:44:46,281 --> 01:44:49,130
Here's the watch the videos at ventings
to send men and it looks all right.

4037
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:53,690
I commentated with anyone's live on him
and I just saw the subtle stuff that he

4038
01:44:53,691 --> 01:44:53,961
does.

4039
01:44:53,961 --> 01:44:55,400
Book cloth on the little slips,

4040
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:56,610
the little step off himself.

4041
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:58,160
Softball and I just said to Vinny,

4042
01:44:58,161 --> 01:44:59,200
I'd like took the microphone.

4043
01:44:59,690 --> 01:45:00,830
This is fucking unreal.

4044
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,060
Just a sort of stuff,

4045
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:04,490
which is what makes it a
level above anyone else.

4046
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:08,630
He's the grass k one fighter of all
time and I mean he puts what he does.

4047
01:45:08,631 --> 01:45:09,191
He's in a gate.

4048
01:45:09,191 --> 01:45:09,400
She,

4049
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:13,410
it negates your rhythm so that when the
Dutch fight they don't fight mainly in

4050
01:45:13,411 --> 01:45:14,180
combination.

4051
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:15,590
The Firefox fast hands,

4052
01:45:15,591 --> 01:45:16,400
fast kicks.

4053
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,240
They find him straight away,

4054
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:20,150
but he negates that first
shot and then he'd step off so

4055
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:22,710
he puts that right Paul,

4056
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:24,530
you fight southpaw.

4057
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:24,700
Yeah,

4058
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:24,980
that's right.

4059
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:25,813
Right palm out.

4060
01:45:25,970 --> 01:45:27,500
He throws a lot of teeth,

4061
01:45:27,501 --> 01:45:31,130
kicks off the right front leg is strong
as well as he's deceptively strong as

4062
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:31,641
Armenian.

4063
01:45:31,641 --> 01:45:33,470
He's not actually
Italian is his real name.

4064
01:45:33,550 --> 01:45:34,830
Gleevec is real.

4065
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:36,320
He called him George Arbitration,

4066
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:37,430
but his real name's Gleevec.

4067
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:39,590
They changed it because it's
more palatable for the Italians,

4068
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,083
but he's a,

4069
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:41,391
yeah,

4070
01:45:41,391 --> 01:45:42,051
he's a very,

4071
01:45:42,051 --> 01:45:43,580
very special individual.

4072
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:44,570
So technical.

4073
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:45,010
Yeah.

4074
01:45:45,010 --> 01:45:47,400
In a really interesting
guy to watch him train too.

4075
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:47,720
Yeah.

4076
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:47,931
I love,

4077
01:45:47,931 --> 01:45:48,990
I love watching them on pallets.

4078
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:50,990
Not Nothing's done override or anything.

4079
01:45:50,991 --> 01:45:51,531
It's all just done.

4080
01:45:51,531 --> 01:45:52,364
Perfect.

4081
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:53,510
Every shot the perfect.

4082
01:45:53,830 --> 01:45:54,190
Yeah.

4083
01:45:54,190 --> 01:45:54,861
I mean again,

4084
01:45:54,861 --> 01:45:56,510
like everybody's got their own style.

4085
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,950
So that's one of the beautiful things
about [inaudible] is that like the,

4086
01:45:59,951 --> 01:46:01,610
the art is very straight forward.

4087
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:05,990
You have your eight weapons but it's
like how you apply those is all based on

4088
01:46:05,991 --> 01:46:06,920
creativity,

4089
01:46:06,921 --> 01:46:10,130
your own personal preferences to the
grip thing about like when you watch the

4090
01:46:10,131 --> 01:46:11,120
top ties in Thailand,

4091
01:46:11,121 --> 01:46:11,391
you love,

4092
01:46:11,391 --> 01:46:15,490
I'm a technician but then you'll have
a big clincher and the might be getting

4093
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,180
the floor with them outside the clinic,

4094
01:46:17,181 --> 01:46:19,940
but as soon as they grumbled and they
stopped buying in big needs in and stuff,

4095
01:46:19,941 --> 01:46:21,740
he's going to make the fight a
lot more interest in its end.

4096
01:46:21,741 --> 01:46:23,750
The technician's job to
keep him off the team,

4097
01:46:23,751 --> 01:46:25,090
to move to score your cakes.

4098
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,890
And that's what the great
thing about mortality.

4099
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:27,230
What I'm saying,

4100
01:46:27,230 --> 01:46:28,940
that's why I love it so much.

4101
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:32,600
Well that's why I think it's the best
striking style is because it incorporates

4102
01:46:32,601 --> 01:46:33,740
so much grappling.

4103
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:38,930
There's so much sweeps and clinch and
knee work and controlling the back of the

4104
01:46:39,411 --> 01:46:40,490
neck and you know,

4105
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:41,353
this is just,

4106
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:42,800
it's so effective.

4107
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:44,300
It's to take that out.

4108
01:46:44,301 --> 01:46:46,340
Like when I watch a boxing
match and they're like break,

4109
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:46,911
I'm like,

4110
01:46:46,911 --> 01:46:47,500
why break?

4111
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:48,200
And yeah,

4112
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,100
we'll go back and watch
Jack Johnson place.

4113
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,630
You ever watch old Jack Johnson fights?

4114
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:52,553
I've never seen

4115
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:58,920
the shit out of everybody in clinch skill
where you see that was a heavy weight

4116
01:46:59,101 --> 01:46:59,910
from England knee.

4117
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:00,440
He used to,

4118
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:01,273
he used the clinch.

4119
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:04,230
I was saying it's been working with Liam
and doing the seminars that we've been

4120
01:47:04,231 --> 01:47:05,010
doing.

4121
01:47:05,010 --> 01:47:07,750
I've been doing it a long time
and I'm watching him and I'm gone.

4122
01:47:07,790 --> 01:47:08,610
No,

4123
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:09,443
I didn't know.

4124
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:13,140
And it's been brilliant for me to fall
in love with [inaudible] again because

4125
01:47:13,141 --> 01:47:14,090
you'll see what he doesn't it.

4126
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:15,060
I don't know that I thought,

4127
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:16,230
well,

4128
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:17,940
there's so much to boxing,

4129
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:18,350
right?

4130
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:18,631
I mean,

4131
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:23,130
when you see a guy like a Floyd
Mayweather or a real technician like Loma

4132
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:23,400
Chanko,

4133
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:26,520
just use so much to learn now.

4134
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:28,560
Leg Kicks,

4135
01:47:28,590 --> 01:47:29,340
knees,

4136
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:30,180
head kicks,

4137
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:31,830
elbows clench,

4138
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:33,120
all this other stuff.

4139
01:47:33,121 --> 01:47:35,760
And more tie is almost never ending.

4140
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:37,440
I say all the time,

4141
01:47:37,441 --> 01:47:39,530
I've been trading for 20
years and I learn every day.

4142
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:40,291
Every day.

4143
01:47:40,291 --> 01:47:41,610
I will learn just summit new,

4144
01:47:41,611 --> 01:47:44,610
whether it's from someone
in the gym or be inspiring,

4145
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:45,691
whether it's from a cork,

4146
01:47:45,691 --> 01:47:48,160
Richard Barrett from a youtube video
or watching a fight in Thailand.

4147
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:49,830
Some I'm still learning every single day,

4148
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:52,860
and I remember my trainer from Thailand,

4149
01:47:52,861 --> 01:47:53,161
Jay,

4150
01:47:53,161 --> 01:47:54,180
when I will live in there,

4151
01:47:54,420 --> 01:47:54,901
he was saying,

4152
01:47:54,901 --> 01:47:55,770
I'm 50 years old.

4153
01:47:55,771 --> 01:47:57,420
I've been doing this for years.

4154
01:47:57,421 --> 01:47:57,690
He said,

4155
01:47:57,690 --> 01:47:58,830
I learn every day as well.

4156
01:47:58,970 --> 01:47:59,870
That's never right.

4157
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:00,031
Yeah.

4158
01:48:00,031 --> 01:48:00,680
He's never ending.

4159
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:02,070
That's why I'm in love with it so much.

4160
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:03,420
Jujitsu is very similar,

4161
01:48:03,421 --> 01:48:04,010
I could imagine.

4162
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:04,450
Yeah.

4163
01:48:04,450 --> 01:48:06,780
I can imagine MMA being exactly the same,

4164
01:48:06,781 --> 01:48:07,311
but the rest of them,

4165
01:48:07,311 --> 01:48:08,144
the Jujitsu,

4166
01:48:08,510 --> 01:48:11,190
it's one of those things that
on the outside you don't see it.

4167
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:12,650
The closer you get to it,

4168
01:48:12,651 --> 01:48:13,151
the more you real.

4169
01:48:13,151 --> 01:48:13,471
I was like,

4170
01:48:13,471 --> 01:48:13,591
wow,

4171
01:48:13,591 --> 01:48:14,820
this thing is like never ending.

4172
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:16,173
Yeah.

4173
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:17,513
You know what?

4174
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:18,510
I'll be honest,

4175
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:20,640
I've not met anyone that
had rarely disliking it.

4176
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:22,890
They're all pretty decent,

4177
01:48:22,891 --> 01:48:25,920
aren't they nice people and it
did not fuck out of each of them.

4178
01:48:25,921 --> 01:48:27,120
The light jazz.

4179
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:28,950
Talk about a character developer.

4180
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:31,860
I mean what develops your
character more than combat sports?

4181
01:48:32,990 --> 01:48:34,560
You find out who the fuck you are.

4182
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:34,770
Yeah,

4183
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:35,161
exactly.

4184
01:48:35,161 --> 01:48:36,330
And that's what we'll come back to.

4185
01:48:36,331 --> 01:48:37,470
What I was saying earlier,

4186
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,400
you find out who you are.

4187
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:44,040
Some people think folk lists at that me
over people said fuck yeah let's do that

4188
01:48:44,041 --> 01:48:44,340
again.

4189
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:44,941
That you know what I mean?

4190
01:48:44,941 --> 01:48:45,420
Yeah.

4191
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:49,180
And that's that all the best fighters
are all the most best people you're going

4192
01:48:49,181 --> 01:48:49,741
to meet as well.

4193
01:48:49,741 --> 01:48:50,970
I think like look it up.

4194
01:48:50,971 --> 01:48:52,310
Much of a gentleman petroleum is.

4195
01:48:52,810 --> 01:48:53,643
Yeah it is.

4196
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:54,960
Absolutely.

4197
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:57,690
You know what was funny about the fight
with Jordan Potosi in a very similar

4198
01:48:57,691 --> 01:48:58,560
characters that are very,

4199
01:48:58,561 --> 01:48:59,550
very nice people.

4200
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:01,050
I mean Jordan is an absolute,

4201
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:03,300
you won't think Jordan was a
fire even though when I met him,

4202
01:49:03,301 --> 01:49:04,110
super sweetheart,

4203
01:49:04,110 --> 01:49:04,943
lovely guy.

4204
01:49:05,150 --> 01:49:06,330
But you know,

4205
01:49:06,331 --> 01:49:10,200
and then you then at the end of the fight
with Giorgio Petrosyan Joshi and runs

4206
01:49:10,201 --> 01:49:10,381
over,

4207
01:49:10,381 --> 01:49:12,490
but he's had on him because he helps him.

4208
01:49:13,010 --> 01:49:15,240
Cause I think like a truck,

4209
01:49:15,241 --> 01:49:15,541
like,

4210
01:49:15,541 --> 01:49:19,660
and I think he understood that it was a
fight once it's over the bells ring in.

4211
01:49:19,670 --> 01:49:20,221
I said to him,

4212
01:49:20,221 --> 01:49:21,560
cause I messaged Giorgio patrol,

4213
01:49:21,561 --> 01:49:21,901
she said,

4214
01:49:21,901 --> 01:49:22,380
you,

4215
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:23,190
you know,

4216
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:26,220
punched another one of my friends will
have a congratulations but don't hit

4217
01:49:26,221 --> 01:49:29,970
another one of my friends I love me to
deal with as if he's fucking scared like

4218
01:49:29,971 --> 01:49:30,804
it matters.

4219
01:49:30,990 --> 01:49:31,560
And um,

4220
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:32,010
he said,

4221
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:32,371
oh no,

4222
01:49:32,371 --> 01:49:33,204
he kicked hard.

4223
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:34,140
He kicked really hard.

4224
01:49:34,141 --> 01:49:34,801
It kicked very,

4225
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:35,281
very hard.

4226
01:49:35,281 --> 01:49:36,690
So he was still respectful,

4227
01:49:36,691 --> 01:49:37,524
you know.

4228
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:38,433
And he's a good guy.

4229
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:39,360
Well listen,

4230
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:40,111
let's wrap this up.

4231
01:49:40,111 --> 01:49:40,800
Liam,

4232
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,030
thank you so much for being here.

4233
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:44,250
Thank you very much my honor.

4234
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:45,990
And thank you for training with me too.

4235
01:49:45,991 --> 01:49:46,890
That was an odd problem.

4236
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:48,160
That was awesome for me man.

4237
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:48,870
And uh,

4238
01:49:48,870 --> 01:49:51,860
people could find you on Twitter
at Liam underscore bad code.

4239
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:53,410
Get my on my Instagram.

01:49:53,850 --> 01:49:54,750
That gets updated on a,

4241
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:55,511
and I see Twitter,

4242
01:49:55,511 --> 01:49:56,111
I'm on Instagram,

4244
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:57,800

everything.

4246
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,490
I put up posts on the Alma
fights on my seminars,

4247
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:01,880
Amil comedy stuff that
