1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,390
Represents self
reflexivity or cyclicality,

2
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,020
especially in the sense of something
constantly recreating itself,

3
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,070
the eternal return and other
things perceived as cycles.

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,750
Then begin a new,

5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,830
as soon as they end the mythical
Phoenix has a similar similar symbolism.

6
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,510
So now we know what it's called.

7
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:33,770
We have,

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,600
or Boris.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,120
Yes.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,660
Something along those lines
symbolizes the cycle of life.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,160
It's fascinating shit.

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,610
Now we know and smoked serpent is
the name of your band and it's a,

13
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:44,480
is there a website yet?

14
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:46,160
It's smoke syrup and.com no,

15
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:49,040
but you can hear a couple of
songs on leave that name reverb.

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,421
I should get,

17
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:55,070
I should get on reverbnation.com/smoke
so got a couple of songs,

18
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:55,251
Bro.

19
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:56,750
You better get smoked Turkey dark cloud.

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,890
I might not even be available.

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,560
You better do it for this video.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,470
Thank you very much for
being on the podcast.

23
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,410
Eddie Cooler hanging out with you today.

24
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,160
You're welcome horn.

25
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,740
She always a good time buddy.

26
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,053
Anytime.

27
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,883
Bye guys.

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,030
File 80 on Twitter.

29
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,060
Eddie Bravo and red ban.

30
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,470
Red Bin.

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,390
This is a video of me playing pool.

32
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,620
This is not a dumb man.

33
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,330
This is what I'm interested in.

34
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,580
I'm interested in not
even just playing pool,

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,110
watching myself play pool.

36
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,900
There's a rare video of me running out,

37
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,310
especially when I call it,

38
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,480
and then I had to go to the,

39
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,150
to the other room and deal with the little
ones because they called them in the

40
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:40,521
middle of it.

41
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:41,354
He was like,

42
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,203
that's the role.

43
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,180
It's the Joe Thailand

44
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,840
Very Rachel episode.

45
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,540
Watch that video.

46
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,051
I love that.

47
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:51,690
But when I was days,

48
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,011
by the way,

49
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:52,491
when you left,

50
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:53,370
like where's my phone?

51
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,223
I don't know.

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,690
Ari's last show,

53
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:58,310
he fucking stole my phone for a minute.

54
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,750
He kept going.

55
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,990
I was like this somewhere.

56
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,843
I'm just like showing

57
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,230
me,

58
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,220
I'm terrified.

59
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:07,400
I want to listen to my material and
go over it like a real professional.

60
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,980
But Ari just playing this
a little yucky up game.

61
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,510
Black Cock like same trigger,

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,950
but talk about what you do with Sam,

63
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,823
Tripoli,

64
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:17,861
Tripoli.

65
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:20,000
I in all those guys have
this thing where they,

66
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:22,280
you try to steal the other person's phone.

67
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,521
Yeah,

68
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:22,820
you're right.

69
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,800
I like Black Hawks on your Twitter
and your Facebook and like,

70
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,810
like Jason's mom the other day or get it
to Jason's mom or something like that.

71
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:32,210
They get it to Jason's mom.

72
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,190
Whoa.

73
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,760
She's loving.

74
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,060
She,

75
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,120
she doesn't like Black Hawk at all.

76
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,723
How Liberals?

77
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,340
Mom.

78
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,173
Yeah.

79
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,190
Teams.

80
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,023
Mom's a lesbian.

81
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,093
Yeah.

82
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,211
Wow.

83
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:43,811
That's fascinating.

84
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:44,830
His whole life he knew it.

85
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,580
Did he?

86
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,390
What was it they they adopt
or they find a sperm donor?

87
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,690
I think it's his real mom and then
she just married someone later.

88
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:52,970
Yeah.

89
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,650
I think that's what it is.

90
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:53,960
And his,

91
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,190
he has a real sister too.

92
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,610
Yeah.

93
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:55,791
Yeah.

94
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:56,151
That's it.

95
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:59,390
And show the mother bread
for procreation purposes,

96
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:00,790
but essentially lesbian.

97
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,341
Yeah.

98
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:04,360
What is your take on like
this Chaz Bono situation?

99
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,540
Isn't that fascinating?

100
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,130
Incoming?

101
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,341
Yeah.

102
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:11,341
Becoming a man when he was raised by a
woman who was super duper famous and then

103
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,380
chooses somewhere along the line to to,

104
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:17,200
to change sex and become a man.

105
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,000
When you think about that shit,

106
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,520
I think there are some people with their
mind's fucked up in a way that we don't

107
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,510
understand and I think
some things went wrong.

108
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:24,580
It's the middle of war without thumbs,

109
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,490
so maybe somebody is born with the
wrong sex and you just know it.

110
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,110
Just know it.

111
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:29,590
Right.

112
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,430
I feel like a man.

113
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:31,300
I feel like a man.

114
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,690
You're probably going to
feel like I have vagina,

115
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,380
man,

116
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,830
dog.

117
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,461
I think it's awesome.

118
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:37,480
We can fix that shit now,

119
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,260
man.

120
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,093
Dog.

121
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,350
Yeah,

122
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,183
I think it is.

123
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,993
I heard that sound.

124
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,140
I totally agree with you,

125
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:53,351
man.

126
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:53,681
I think,

127
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:53,881
you know,

128
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:54,840
like we were talking about before,

129
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,900
I have a thyroid problem.

130
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:56,980
My thyroid doesn't work good.

131
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,431
You know,

132
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:59,450
some people's brains firing correctly.

133
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:01,600
Some people were really
probably their chemical makeup.

134
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:03,700
They should've been a boy or a girl.

135
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,790
There's no preconceived derogatory
things that have to do with the fibroid.

136
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,550
Lucky for you to want to go.

137
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:09,761
Yeah,

138
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:10,450
exactly.

139
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,170
Exactly.

140
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,880
If you don't want to go
through a sex change,

141
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:13,130
man,

142
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,440
that's like God damn commitment.

143
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,960
I got to think you're
really telling the truth.

144
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,000
You must be like,

145
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:20,921
I'm not enough.

146
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:21,731
For a long time.

147
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:23,800
It's hacked off and they've
got to grow me a cock.

148
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,310
There'll be eventually they'll be
able to grow your cock right now.

149
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,800
They can't now think grow
an ear on a mice though.

150
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,731
I worked for,

151
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:32,330
I worked for a transsexual,

152
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,173
preop transsexual,

153
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,790
but I was in a law firm.

154
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,673
You work the file room.

155
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,550
Holy Shit.

156
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,530
He only likes fucking straight men.

157
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,850
Whoa.

158
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,780
What did it feel like?

159
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,810
Yeah,

160
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,060
he said he would have to go to face them,

161
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:50,410
so we'd have to put
his leg on top of them.

162
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,083
Oh my God.

163
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,860
How'd you get a straight man to fuck you?

164
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,730
Because I'm a woman.

165
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,223
Why wouldn't they

166
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,460
or they fuck him?

167
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,800
Fuck him in the ass and do
they know they're fucking,

168
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:03,030
I know.

169
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,570
They just like,

170
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:04,871
no,

171
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,560
I know you're real.

172
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,330
You're a woman or your heart or something.

173
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:08,470
Oh my God.

174
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,100
I have a friend who is gay and he
says that gay guys suck his Dick.

175
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,130
All the tar straight
guys rather on silent.

176
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:15,551
Yeah.

177
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:17,200
He says he gets straight
guys to suck his dick.

178
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,040
He says they,

179
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,930
they act curious a bar somewhere and
he'll tell them there that he's gay and

180
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:25,240
then there'll be curious and before
you know they're blowing him.

181
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:25,721
He said,

182
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:26,640
it happens all the time.

183
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:26,921
I'm like,

184
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,990
that's not a fucking straight guy man.

185
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,150
You're saying you've got a
straight guy to suck your Dick.

186
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,640
You got a gay guy who was
in the closet to blow you.

187
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,410
It's not really a straight guy.

188
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,450
You met him at a gay bar

189
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,180
for sure.

190
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,540
There's certain people
have degrees of gay and um,

191
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,170
you know how we talked about yesterday,

192
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,180
this new girl that you're dating,

193
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,700
it's got you so excited and
you could fuck all the time.

194
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,460
It's like you connect to her and this,

195
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:52,750
this straight sex.

196
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,730
It's like there's a vibe
between the two of units,

197
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:56,230
like a powerful straight sex vibe.

198
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,460
I think some dudes can
get dudes to be gay.

199
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,870
Like you might have been really happy
with being straight and having a wife and

200
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,460
children and you know,

201
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,200
and having like some sort of a weird,

202
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,320
none exciting sex life and less,

203
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,400
you met the right gay guy along the way.

204
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,530
It turned your ass and made
you be a super gay freakazoid,

205
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,730
which is very possible.

206
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,210
You know,

207
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,050
if you just,

208
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:19,460
I think part of the right person,

209
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,810
the right stage of your life.

210
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,690
And I'm not saying you cause you
couldn't and I'm not saying you can,

211
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,280
but you can be on the offense.

212
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,320
I think those people are
already like probably bisexual,

213
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:27,950
but hiding it.

214
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,890
Cause it's

215
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,780
like that joke that I used to do about,

216
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,260
um,

217
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,280
about people.

218
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:35,330
There's somewhere out there,

219
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,940
there's someone who could talk
some people into suck in the deck.

220
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,640
That is just the way it is.

221
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,210
And it's,

222
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:41,620
it's,

223
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,453
it's,

224
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,580
it's a fact that some people can just be
tricked and it doesn't necessarily mean

225
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,180
they're gay.

226
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,760
And I think that's one of the reasons
why so many people are afraid of gay

227
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:50,360
people.

228
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,290
What they're afraid of.

229
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,940
It's being tricked by a superior
intellect that happens to be homosexual.

230
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,481
And then actually,

231
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:56,661
you know,

232
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:58,310
that guy is shooting
loads and your asshole.

233
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:58,920
Well,

234
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,960
it's terrifying for,

235
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,853
for retards.

236
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,660
Whoops,

237
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,493
Don people,

238
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,573
it's hard.

239
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,933
No,

240
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,281
ladies and gentlemen,

241
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,360
we need me no harm.

242
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,841
Okay.

243
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:14,150
We're just out here trying to have a
good time and trying to learn and grow as

244
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:14,984
humans.

245
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,670
We're doing a lot together with Brian.

246
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:17,504
Read ballets,

247
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,993
college boy.

248
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,363
Hello.

249
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,563
Hi.

250
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:27,890
Come on man.

251
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,723
What's happening?

252
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,870
This is a gloss my man.

253
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,983
How are you doing?

254
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,600
Do you know what information?

255
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,070
Alien.

256
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,660
So Hey Brian,

257
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,260
video of them quick changes.

258
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,610
The door rep is Veronica.

259
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,050
Giorgio pleasure.

260
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,043
How are you?

261
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,190
You're from ancient aliens.

262
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,053
Yeah.

263
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,710
He never seen the shootout
with the crazy hair.

264
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,200
I have.

265
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,350
No,

266
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,240
but I liked the hair

267
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,050
look so weird that

268
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,570
started rolling.

269
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,680
We got to get the fuck out of here.

270
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:06,730
I'm quite sure it gets weird.

271
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,270
The trick is to

272
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,130
build the city

273
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,540
that's going on right now,

274
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,490
right?

275
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,160
Doug Benson,

276
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,993
am I correct?

277
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,910
I have a feeling it's all in our minds.

278
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,790
I have a feeling of the
whole alien experience.

279
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,050
There's all psychedelic
chemicals including all the
shit that was created and

280
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:45,760
nobody could figure out
what's the pyramids or all
these other crazy structures.

281
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,240
I think that you guys were down on
the money when you talk about ancient

282
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:51,730
civilizations going to talk about
like Graham Hancock can shit,

283
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,890
but there was some super
advanced civilization,

284
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,050
but I don't think they got it.

285
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,640
I think they got drugs and I
think the drugs are the aliens.

286
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,140
And I think when you take those trucks,

287
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,120
you contact alien.

288
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,240
And I'm not bullshitting you.

289
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:04,980
Take DMT,

290
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,400
Bro.

291
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,720
I think you're contacting the elements.

292
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:07,800
I really fucking do.

293
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,940
I felt raped of mentally
but in the best way ever.

294
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:13,080
When I came back to that,

295
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:18,081
like someone just saw through me and sees
me for this really insignificant like

296
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,860
style of creature,

297
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,251
you know,

298
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:23,190
really like mundane and really
easy to solve and figure out.

299
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,740
It just exposed me and um,

300
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,880
expose me to infinite wisdom
that was impossible to grasp.

301
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,410
But it did it all on
some sort of a language.

302
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,730
I think that is the alien.

303
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,770
I think the alien is
psychedelic chemicals.

304
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:38,850
And we know if there's a great history
of human use of psychedelic chemicals

305
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:40,800
dating back thousands
and thousands of years,

306
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,050
mushrooms draw on cave walls,

307
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:43,591
you know,

308
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:44,610
all the evidence of,

309
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:48,810
of ritualistic use of cannabis that takes
thousands and thousands of years BC.

310
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,910
So if we know that they
knew about all this shit,

311
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,460
we know that they knew about the avenue,

312
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,740
the miscarriage mushroom and,

313
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,330
and you know,

314
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:54,510
and,

315
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,321
and the Amazon,

316
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:58,290
they've been doing Iowasca for
thousands and thousands of years.

317
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,480
They don't even know how long because
they don't even write it down.

318
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,710
They just always have done it.

319
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,151
That's the alien,

320
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:03,960
Bro.

321
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,710
That's the alien.

322
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,190
The alien is these compounds and the
aliens are real because these top pounds,

323
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,530
I'll allow you to get to this other place.

324
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,490
They allow you to communicate with
something and that's why all these people

325
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,790
were abducted in the middle of the night.

326
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,330
Man,

327
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,310
they're abducted in the middle of the
night because that's when your brain is

328
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:18,360
producing DMT.

329
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,960
That's when your brain spruce and
psychedelic chemicals and when your brain

330
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:22,950
produces those chemicals,

331
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:25,620
it opens that gateway and you
communicate with these fucking things.

332
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,140
We just want everything real to be,

333
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,920
someone said this,

334
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,060
I think it was Terence Mckenna,

335
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,810
that people have a problem
with something that's real,

336
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:34,140
that you can't hit with a hammer.

337
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,770
Right.

338
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,600
And I think that's a
real way of putting it.

339
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,870
It's a real issue cause
farts are real as fuck dude,

340
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,730
you can't wrap your hands around
them but you know they're real.

341
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,900
Sound is real.

342
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,000
But we accept it because
we're so used to it.

343
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,690
The idea that this is an invisible thing
can can transmit music and harmony and

344
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,480
and beautiful feelings and make you
fucking pumped up and you hear it,

345
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:54,070
your car singing it and what the,

346
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,170
what the fuck is that?

347
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,260
It's invisible shit and invisible
shitting but it's coming for fucking

348
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:59,400
satellites down to us.

349
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,700
We want to think that we've got
the whole world figured out.

350
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,960
We want to think that we know what's
real and what's here and that all the

351
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:08,730
weekends sense is all it is there.

352
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,481
And I say,

353
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:10,171
fuck that.

354
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:11,400
I said that's ridiculous.

355
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,510
And I say if you look at some shit that
your own brain produces and this shift

356
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:16,710
that your own brain producers,

357
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,760
producers,

358
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,660
profound visions and clinical experiences,

359
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,560
I got to think that
that shit is the alien.

360
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,150
That's what it is.

361
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,450
It's not dudes and metal crafts
are coming from outer space.

362
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,660
It's fucking fine that you mix with a
leave and the boil it fire and the Amazon

363
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:40,950
for fucking 10 hours and then you drink
the shit and go on a ride with the

364
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,910
flying serpents fucking twist around
you and they're all made out of light,

365
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,640
you know,

366
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,260
and they teach you about the spirit world
and your ancestors and that everyone's

367
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:50,580
around you all the time,

368
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:51,540
always and forever.

369
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,800
They just move in and out at different.

370
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,420
That's some fucking to the
sticker thing under your ass.

371
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,280
That's all.

372
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,560
Everybody's crazy to all the people
you're talking to you on your show are

373
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:03,394
fucking crazy.

374
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,380
Got To show that everyone's misunderstood
and everyone's crazy and they both had

375
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:09,140
experiences.

376
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,560
But what you need to do is get
them high on DMT and they'd go,

377
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,693
that's it.

378
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,143
That's it.

379
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,283
That's it.

380
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,980
I'll show you a video channel
and just smoke some shit.

381
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:21,820
And when I'm bored,

382
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,350
you understand what's happening here.

383
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,610
It's not here.

384
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,210
That's why you're never going to see
them all that shit flying over London.

385
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,044
You're never going to see him.

386
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,630
So that's what I'm thinking about aliens.

387
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,861
Unfortunately,

388
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:34,090
that kills the whole show.

389
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,050
That was that whole shot.

390
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,560
So let's keep speculating.

391
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,430
Thank you.

392
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,970
I'm coming out before I come up,

393
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,090
I got a bunch of new friends.

394
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,350
I got Doug Benson in their house

395
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,530
and as far as going to
bring up is in my opinion,

396
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:00,510
the funniest human on
the face of the earth.

397
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,730
You might know him from the longest yard.

398
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,650
You might know him from my podcast.

399
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,623
You might know.

400
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,310
Give it up for joing.

401
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,203
Kakoda

402
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,320
no,

403
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,153
Joe

404
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,960
[inaudible] over to you now,

405
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,330
right now,

406
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,163
but sometimes love it.

407
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:24,671
I love that.

408
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,504
This food open.

409
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,570
Fucking ridiculous.

410
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,200
We got to stay here a minute.

411
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,900
So what are you saying that the
turn in the Luxor into a gay hotel.

412
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,140
I'm just saying the last time I
stayed there I started to lot.

413
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,993
I was mad

414
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:45,500
shit.

415
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,230
Joe Login was awesome tonight in French.

416
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,420
He was awesome.

417
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,630
Awesome show.

418
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,680
Pay there tonight.

419
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,970
I'm going to say it on the air
tomorrow now that'll fuck him up on it.

420
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,200
I started singing the shit
during fucking Greenland.

421
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,981
What are you going to do then,

422
00:13:57,981 --> 00:13:58,490
Joe?

423
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,323
Mr.

424
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,970
Seriously,

425
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,960
when we're on game play,

426
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,973
we'll play my own game.

427
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,350
He went,

428
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,390
I want to be motherfuckers.

429
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,233
So just Drake.

430
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,820
Now I don't pee and I steal Joe Spoon
and I text all you fuckers are drinking

431
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,600
shots and I'm not even in the bathroom.

432
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,440
Much more exciting when
that's uncircumcised to how,

433
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,220
Oh,

434
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,053
that's a horse.

435
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,630
That is bad ass.

436
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,860
They sell four sticks.

437
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,480
Did Not want it goes right into your,

438
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:35,790
yeah,

439
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,570
your dirty fucking mouth bitch.

440
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,330
Fucking kind.
