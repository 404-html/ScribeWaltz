1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,770
Boom.
All right.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,100
I love when I see something online where
I see someone who takes the idea of

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:11,360
fixing something or reengineering
something you're making,

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,980
it just goes so far out there.
Something totally irrational. Go.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,950
Who is this fucking crazy guy yet?
I saw,

6
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:24,510
I think the first thing I saw was
your Bronco. Um, the uh, icon Bronco,

7
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:29,180
which is just, you took a car,
which is the Ford Bronco, the,

8
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:33,120
the 60s and early seventies versions,
which are, you know, this kind of

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,170
slight, it's a cool car.
It's a cool old car.

10
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:40,440
A lot of people take the tops off of them
and they're always kind of rickety and

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,760
funky looking and you just
engineered this thing to this,

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,980
to the nth degree with these,

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,430
these billet door openers and the way
you have this step comes out when he's,

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,370
I'm like, who the fuck is this guy? And
I'm so then I started going into your,

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,030
your website and the two
different companies, Tlc,

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,890
where you take old land
cruisers and reengineer those
and put modern engines and

17
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:07,190
suspensions.
And I'm like what the,

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,620
I just love that someone like you
is out there. Sweet. Thank you.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,470
Cause I had no investors
that were smarter than me.

20
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:17,160
They said you're fucked our
don't even do this bad business.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,980
But they were wrong though.
They were wrong obviously.

22
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:23,820
I mean your shop is enormous.
There's like a beehive.

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,220
People were constantly
buzzing around there working.

24
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,340
You've got a hundred different
projects going concurrently. You're,

25
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:32,640
you're the Bronco Build. Would you say
like a three year wait list right now?

26
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,091
Yeah.

27
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:37,610
We've sold 62 of them so far and delivery
dates unfortunately are running like

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,760
late third quarter 2018 which sucks.
It drives me nuts.

29
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,650
Is there anything that you
can do to ramp that up?

30
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,640
You would have to just have like four
or five of those giant warehouses.

31
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,790
That's part of the problem.

32
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,040
So like we're trying to move
and find a bigger building.

33
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:53,970
We're just about 50,000 square now
and it's all ass and elbows like a,

34
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:57,780
I think we could hire maybe three or
more guys before we're out of space.

35
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,070
But more importantly,

36
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:04,071
it's difficult to find those people
because kind of the idiocy of what I do is

37
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:12,300
going against modern trends and
American design and manufacturer.

38
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:17,010
So it's really hard to find people
that have the crazy skillset that,

39
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,450
that we require. Well, that's what really
impressed me about what you're doing.

40
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:21,940
W what,

41
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,140
what impressed me about what you're doing
is not just that you're reengineering

42
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:27,780
things and improving and upgrading,
but there's this,

43
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,140
this ode to craftsmanship.
There's this,

44
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:36,141
this passion in what you're doing where
it might not necessarily make sense.

45
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,250
Oh, everything we do, if you want to just
want to bring up that term practicality,

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,110
it makes absolutely no sense.
Um,

47
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,490
but to me that's kind of why we do it
and why I'm so passionate about every

48
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:54,600
project we do because I've approached
it from the obtuse angle of, okay,

49
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:56,640
that's how it's been done in the past.
And you know,

50
00:02:56,641 --> 00:03:00,040
stock restorations are great and
they fit niche and they're right

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,080
for that guy.
Personally,

52
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,590
I have no patience for
archaic mechanical interface,

53
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:09,580
but I love and to just static. And
then resto shops, hot rod shops.

54
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:10,960
Traditionally they buy this piece,

55
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:14,440
that piece and kind of cobbled together
and that's cool. But I always thought,

56
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,790
well, you've got this convergence
of cad design, you know,

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,800
computer aided design resources and a
convergence of reverse engineering and low

58
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:28,801
volume manufacturing capabilities that
kind of are creating a perfect storm

59
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:33,931
where the stupid stuff we can dream up
an execute and make a relatively viable

60
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:37,960
business model out of it wasn't
even possible 10 years ago.

61
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,410
So I've been lucky enough to find enough
people that Gri with my craziness and

62
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,160
let me not compromise and whore it out,

63
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,210
but to really hold the
line and keep pushing the
boundaries and keep geeking out

64
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,860
further and further.
Well,

65
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,100
it seems like over the last year or so
I've been hearing about you more and more

66
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,520
and more and more. And then Jay
Leno's garage featured, uh, he,

67
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,430
he's featured a few of your cars.
Yeah,

68
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,910
we've been on Jay's show I
think four times now. What
a fucking trip that places,

69
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:11,840
Huh? Off? Just I was just
there on Tuesday. Oh my God.

70
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:16,180
It was just is what I Geek boner I had
walking around that place a willing to

71
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:19,690
keep your Chesney because what's crazy
is a lot of people don't realize the

72
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:23,410
depth of that subculture.
So Jay is wonderful in that.

73
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:28,411
He's almost become sort of a spokesman
for the niches and odd proclivities in

74
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:31,090
mechanical goodness.

75
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,120
But just in La alone there's tons of
dudes with these ridiculous man caves full

76
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:41,200
of wild mechanical
beasts and it is so cool.

77
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,880
And that's another thing like I never
had the intelligence to anticipate when I

78
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:49,570
built the first icon,
which was based on the Fj 40 Land Cruiser,

79
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,690
I just built it because it was keeping
me up at night and I have this idea and

80
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,730
after doing a design job for Toyota,

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,860
I told Mr Toyota about my stupid idea
and he kind of sort of off the record

82
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:02,710
bowed and said, go for it full,
but we won't get in your way.

83
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,510
So I built it to realize that
sort of model I had in my head.

84
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,870
Then I went back and added up
how much it costs and I saw shit,

85
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,970
no one's going to go for this.
This is stupid.

86
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,550
And I talked to some
people smarter than me,

87
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:18,910
really big brand people and
they said, no, keep it pure,

88
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:22,180
keep it what you want and what you're
proud of and you'll build a market.

89
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,630
So I gambled and rolled with them and
now like 30 plus percent of our clients

90
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:33,160
have two or more of our projects where
I was having a hard time getting my head

91
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:35,770
around. People would be able to
justify the expense of one of them.

92
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,450
Well there's so well done.

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,480
And one of the things that I was really
impressed with was just the Fj 62 land

94
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,730
cruiser conversions that you've done.

95
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,180
Like cause that for a lot of people that
aren't fans of that aesthetic or fans

96
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:49,720
of that,

97
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,720
that's just a regular four
door suburban type SUV vehicle.

98
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,040
They just,
you know,

99
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,350
most people would look at
that and they would go,

100
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:02,870
there it is on the big screen when they
would look at that and go, oh that's,

101
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:06,920
you know, that's cool. One of those cars.
But that's part of the appeal though.

102
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,760
Yeah, because it's pure
utility. There's no fluff,

103
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,510
there's nothing superfluous
and people yearn for that.

104
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,040
Cause if you look at modern cars, I don't
care what it is, longevity, simplicity,

105
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,220
durability, no one's thinking
about those things anymore.

106
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,970
They're priorities are totally
different. So a lot of guys go, hey, I,

107
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,690
I used to have one of those land
cruisers, man, I miss that thing.

108
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:31,280
I go to the dealer,
I look at everything,

109
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:35,000
I can buy whatever I want and it's
sucks. Everything's plastic, has no soul,

110
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:37,160
doesn't have that utilitarian route to it.

111
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:42,161
So there's kind of a subculture that'll
gravitate to wanting to go back to that.

112
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,880
And some of them are cool with them stock,

113
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,530
but more and more people
have been perverted by modern
vehicles and like could

114
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:53,120
we make the pedal on the right actually
do something and really do something

115
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,830
well your, your Bronco was like this
beautiful. So I mean that, that,

116
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,410
that shape with the
icon bumper, it's, it's,

117
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:04,490
it's so sexy to the average person
looking at it. It's sexy, but did this,

118
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:09,491
it's like you kind of have to be a fan
of that style of Land Cruiser four door

119
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:11,960
with the hatch and the back Land Cruiser,

120
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,830
but what you've done is like
completely bonkers. This is what,

121
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,960
what this is is an Fj 62 and
you call them a one 42 right?

122
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:25,961
Because you take an FJ 80 and you combine
it with the Fj 62 so what he does is

123
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,210
he takes his fucking thing, strips
it down to nothing. I mean you could,

124
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:35,120
you could do this way better than me.
Paul urea coats it,

125
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,260
media blasts it the that you,

126
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:42,261
you take this thing and make it a
combination of monitored underpinnings

127
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:48,011
completely redone as far as like weather
protection and the moisture protection.

128
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,230
It's like at a level that nobody ever
engineered before and then you took put a

129
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:55,520
modern corvette engine in it,
450 horsepower plus,

130
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,540
I mean this is bananas and you're,

131
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,380
you're taking this car that was
like how much was where these new,

132
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,240
I think they were expensive when they
were new, but that means what? 20 grand?

133
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,860
Probably 25 grand I think,

134
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:11,630
and engineer's him to the point where
they're 160 plus thousand dollar cars.

135
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,770
It's total stealth wealth,
like the natural decline of the appeal.

136
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:19,910
I find like guys will take these on surf
trips down through Central America and

137
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:23,520
not have to stress out or freak
out or worry about, you know,

138
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,460
the other preconceived
notions like you know,

139
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:29,120
people see you're rolling in a
nice modern supercar sports car.

140
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,390
And unfortunately in our culture is
a lot of guys are, I'll look at that.

141
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:37,250
Rich pricking his Porsche, right?
You know, it just gets beyond that.

142
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:40,910
So either totally invisible or you
get kind of warm fuzzy thumbs up,

143
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:43,880
smiles and it's,
it's just a whole different energy.

144
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,650
Well then I started
going into the sub code.

145
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:49,340
I was what wasn't aware that there was a
subculture of people that were obsessed

146
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:52,040
with [inaudible].
It's amazing.

147
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:56,160
There's so many different little
Twitter follower that you can go to.

148
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,350
We could see the images
that they post or Instagram.

149
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,680
These cars have this crazy legendary
following where people just are obsessed

150
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:07,260
with these old, like it was
this, what years are these?

151
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:12,210
These 1989 1900 specifically the ones
with the four rectangular headlights,

152
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:16,620
the Fj six two or [inaudible] 88 to
90 and then the proceeding models,

153
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:21,300
the Fj six D, which looks about the
same, those were from 81 to 87 why?

154
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,300
What gave you the motivation to take this
particular type of car and engineered

155
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,450
to such an incredible degree?
What we started with the older ones,

156
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,660
such a forties right? Yeah, the
forties which are really sexy,

157
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,650
that call, it's tremendous. It's crazy.

158
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,660
But we started with a 40 and then the
45 pickups and wagons and the Fj 55

159
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:43,494
wagons.

160
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,770
So it's just sort of the culture of
evolved in that those were so archaic

161
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,270
because they were earlier
standards earlier. Tokes yeah,

162
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,850
choke and one barrel carb. Three on the
tree and drum brakes. No power. Yeah.

163
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,580
So I think as these got older and the
average conditions of the ones people

164
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:05,160
could find out there
became lesser and lesser,

165
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,210
that market naturally extended into
these models and people say, well, Hey,

166
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:11,250
well what about a 60 what about a six to,

167
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,560
we're even doing the MCJ eighties doing
major rest of [inaudible] 91 to 97

168
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:20,090
versions because again,
there's a certain, um,

169
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,170
attachment that people will have with
them that even though the truck has gone

170
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:28,650
or it had shortcomings that still
holds a spot in their heart,

171
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,480
which is kind of a big part of the 98%
of the battle is already won with icon

172
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,030
because the majority of our projects,

173
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:39,600
we're starting with something that
already gives people warm and fuzzies.

174
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,620
Any of these cars have cult
followings and shortcomings,

175
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,330
which is kind of the perfect formula
to let me revision them and create

176
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:51,960
something like a new option for
people that appreciate it. Well,

177
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,610
I wasn't even a fan of these,

178
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,990
but I became a fan from just going
over your website and then watching the

179
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:58,680
vehicles.

180
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,520
I watched a couple of the videos and
Jonathan has these videos that he puts on

181
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:05,190
youtube. We put sticks, a
couple of Gopros and the cars,

182
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:08,160
and you personally take them out,
which is very good videos to suck. No,

183
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:12,180
they don't. No, they don't
suck it off. They're great.

184
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,870
They're really effective because yeah,
throw one of those,

185
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:17,940
like the second one down the,
that one right there,

186
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,090
they're not even remotely sucky.

187
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,850
What they are is 100% authentic.

188
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,340
Like when you're taking these cars out,

189
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,090
you're going over all the different
upgrades and different things that you've

190
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:33,630
done to them. That's when you
really start getting it. You Go, oh,

191
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,100
this guy's fucking crazy.

192
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,090
And as crazy as me at
$170,000 $20,000 car.

193
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,780
Yeah. And that's been a, cause
I don't have the budget, but B,

194
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,980
because I concur with you
that brands like these,

195
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,440
if they're not driven out of the vision
of the singular lunatic, then they're,

196
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,960
they're not worth doing.

197
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,110
So I wanted to keep that relationship
and personal relationship.

198
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:05,800
So although I just knock the videos
out and edit them real quick.

199
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,060
But I really want people to understand
the level of geekness that we do.

200
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:13,270
And well, you even leave in when you
dropped your Gopro and one of them,

201
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,200
I love that too. Up here it
goes, bump, bump, bump. But this,

202
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:20,830
this is the passion comes through and I'm,
I'm a,

203
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,470
I'm a big fan of contagious passion.

204
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,590
And I mean there's things that I
was never interested in before.

205
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:30,040
Like I never gave a fuck about cooking.
I loved good food,

206
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,550
but I'd never give a fuck about cooking
until I watched Anthony Bourdain's,

207
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:34,510
no reservations.

208
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,950
And I'd see the passion that this guy
has about chefs and about preparation and

209
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:40,000
the, you know, just the,

210
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:43,960
the amount of skill that is
involved in creating a perfect meal.

211
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,840
And then I started to get, I'm
like, oh, this is an art form.

212
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,170
It's an art form that I never
understood. Totally. This is an art form.

213
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,400
Kneeling is an art form. That's the
history of the world in a nutshell.

214
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,140
Anyone who's ever done a great thing,
be it important or not be a he,

215
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:03,460
a chef, a sculptor, a
seamstress, a woodcarver,

216
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,550
a leader,
a political figure or whatever.

217
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,880
It was that inner passion that drove it
and made it distinct and really matter.

218
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,330
So fortunately I'm feeling like I'm not
the only idiot in the last three or four

219
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:23,290
years. It's kind of like this, like
it's like there's a renaissance.

220
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,530
I think consumers are
tired of the big box,

221
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:31,180
luxury branded kind of bullshit marketing
facade and want like we all already

222
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:33,820
have enough crap in the first world,
right?

223
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,050
So if you're going to buy another
something like you with your pool cues and

224
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,260
you're going to buy another pull cue,
there's going to be a story to that.

225
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:41,870
Fuck it.

226
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,070
It's going to mean something in someone's
going to put their heart and soul on

227
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:45,311
that.

228
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:50,300
So I'm starting to see
this sort of craftsmen,

229
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:55,650
collective renaissance of makers of
people creating stuff out of passion,

230
00:13:55,751 --> 00:14:00,751
not out of a spreadsheet and a vcs formula
of how well it's going to do on Wall

231
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:05,910
Street. But product first because I think
we forgot about that as a country we,

232
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,420
we kind of walked away from that
slowly seeing that come back.

233
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,490
Yeah. It seems recently. Yeah. Recently
that's become like all sorts of things.

234
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:19,510
I watched a video on this company
called Brooklyn Cut. It was another,

235
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,520
a manmade. The knives. Yeah, and
I was like, this is fascinating.

236
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,760
I never gave a shit about a guy making
dies and I'm watching this guy make these

237
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,090
handmade butcher knives and
kitchen knives. I was like, ah,

238
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,710
but you could see like the sweat and
dirt in his hands and he's going over the

239
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:40,180
edges and making sure everything's Nice.
Like Ah, there's something about that,

240
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:41,530
that I'm as an adult,

241
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:46,330
just starting to recognize this contagious
aspect and how important it is and

242
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:50,200
how when you see people
that are passionate about
things, no matter what it is,

243
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:52,460
like you said, like, you
know, make making furniture

244
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,120
or anything, it's, there's something
about it that gets you excited.

245
00:14:56,121 --> 00:15:00,620
Like you're almost, you're pulling some
of their energy from their creation. Yeah,

246
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,080
the semi. That's the,
that's the perfect formula.

247
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:06,710
Because then also even if
you don't become a consumer,

248
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:08,540
their price point doesn't
make sense or whatever.

249
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:12,890
Just if you respect it and understand
where they're coming from and you in turn

250
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:16,490
are inspired to do whatever it is that
you know you've been staying in your

251
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:21,140
cubicle and earning your good salary
but your soul is dead and you start

252
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:24,950
tinkering at night, get in the garage
on the weekends or whatever it is.

253
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,750
I think that's key because you know
our government for decades now has been

254
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:33,470
telling us just go to target and
buy something and we'll all be fine.

255
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,230
Which I think is just
asinine because that was,

256
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:41,231
the country was built on people trying
new ideas and taking risk and standing up

257
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:46,460
for what they believe in and if we
just turn into a nation of consumers,

258
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:50,180
then why should anyone give a shit about
our opinion and our nosiness telling

259
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,260
them how to run their country.

260
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,430
This is another thing that I was really
struck by when I was tooling around your

261
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:55,821
shop,

262
00:15:55,821 --> 00:16:00,680
which is insanely impressive and sitting
in your cars is that they'll build

263
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:03,170
quality,
like you're sitting in everything.

264
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,860
Like this fucking thing is
going to last a hundred years,

265
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,360
like all of your stuff.

266
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,980
And then we had that conversation about
planned obsolescence that companies are

267
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:16,610
actually engineering planned
obsolescence into their automobiles,

268
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:17,360
which had business.

269
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,570
A lot of people always think is like some
sort of a conspiracy theory. Like oh,

270
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:21,890
that's, you know, nonsense.

271
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:24,980
They're just trying to do the best thing
they can with modern electronics and

272
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:28,450
some of that stuff breaks. But that's
not really the case. All Shit. Yeah.

273
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,530
Explain to me what you
explained to me today.

274
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,620
Basically I think in the old days you
were dealing with products were designed

275
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:40,520
and manufactured for the sake of the
product, you know, pretty simple, linear,

276
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,600
pure concept.
Um,

277
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:47,390
unfortunately I would blame it on
Wall Street more than anything in that

278
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:52,391
suddenly the product in a product
company was no longer the priority.

279
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:57,680
The priority was the margin,
the scalability, the numbers
for the shareholders.

280
00:16:57,681 --> 00:17:02,681
So the second you take your eye off
of the product being what drives the

281
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:07,070
company, it's going to go to shit one
way or another. So like car companies,

282
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,920
I mean there's stories that uh,

283
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,940
a certain Japanese car company whose
name I will not mention actually went and

284
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:18,140
studied, paid Microsoft
and said, oh wait a minute.

285
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,710
So you're a consumer buys a laptop.

286
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,580
When the battery dies,
you're retaining that client.

287
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:28,310
And the vast majority of those
clients aren't buying a battery.

288
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:31,040
They're buying another laptop.
Oh,

289
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:36,020
this could the business this very good.
So how racist of you by the way,

290
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,770
very racist. You know, I
love the whole world baby,

291
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,530
but it's doing it and I wouldn't,

292
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,720
I don't mean to infer that
this is an Asian dish,

293
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,170
certainly not corporate priority.

294
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,300
It's global is guilty as
anyone American has been.

295
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,330
That's been the one that people
point to because American cars,

296
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:56,730
especially like in the
80s where such shit,

297
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,770
they would just fall apart on a
regular basis. Yeah. So you know,

298
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,280
we could have a long bitch fest about
what unions have done to impact product

299
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:08,700
and viability of American manufacturer
and all that. It's another story,

300
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:12,600
but I think on the product level,
suddenly automotive brands,

301
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:17,580
we're looking at creating a vehicle
that by nature the durability of the

302
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:21,600
components within and the complexity of
the architecture to facilitate all the

303
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:26,601
perversions that we've come to expect
in modern cars automatically set the

304
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:30,300
obsolescence cycle.
So it's much better business,

305
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,280
although much worse for the future
to make a vehicle Wizbang nifty,

306
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:40,430
groovy designed to survive a life cycle
of a lease or warranty cycle and then

307
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,220
it's off to the landfill and then
what happens? Repeat consumer,

308
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:45,870
you come back and yet by another one,

309
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,910
Japan's taken it in other nations to and
even crazier level to promote the GDP.

310
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,410
It's actually hard for you to
own your car the older it gets,

311
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:57,290
your inspections become more routine.

312
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,970
They go from a yearly to
quarterly and on and on and on.

313
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,020
Registration goes up every year,
insurance goes up. This is in Japan.

314
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,260
It goes yearly to quarterly
to what was he goes,

315
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,970
I believe it's yearly to buy annual to
quarterly and then if it's a really old

316
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:15,870
vehicle, it's like monthly and
then the [inaudible] scrutiny,

317
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,830
like you have one little league,
oh and then you can't get your red.

318
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:22,350
You've got to dial that in. So
it's been great for, you know,

319
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,890
domestic manufacturing numbers
and keeping industry propped up,

320
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,920
but it's kind of bullshit and
shortsighted I think on a cultural level.

321
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:34,441
Well,

322
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:38,190
it's fascinating because they're known
for their door ability like Toyota cars,

323
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:42,550
especially. Honda's are the
reliability. Like if you own,

324
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,860
let's say an Lx five 70 which are great
trucks and modern SUV version of the

325
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:51,120
Land Cruiser, they're brilliant. They're
strong. Yeah. It'll run forever probably.

326
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:54,810
And it's super durable. But let's talk
about your touch screen on the dash.

327
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,270
When that bugger breaks,

328
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,350
you can't use your climate control
and a whole bunch of other things.

329
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,640
I already have an Lx five 70 and
it's the touchscreens dog shit,

330
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,350
but really is dog shit. Now let's flash
forward to your, you love your truck.

331
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,530
The warranty has expired and
that screen takes a shit.

332
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,780
Well that the problem is
everything is engineered into it.

333
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:17,130
Like the climate control is my point.
It's part of no labs for it now.

334
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:21,390
That part is available now
and it's federally mandated
that it must be available

335
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:25,260
for a specific window of time.
That part today,

336
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:27,480
I'm going to make an educated guess.

337
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:32,100
It's a $9,000 module for you to buy
that stupid touchscreen. Yes sir.

338
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,690
It's shit though. It's not good.
It's not that responsive. Okay.

339
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,540
So five years from now it dies. It's
out of warranty. You'll love the truck.

340
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,360
It's nine grant. If it is still
available, what do you do?

341
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,470
You likely say I fuck it and you go get
a new one back to their business model.

342
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,060
Yeah,
it's a,

343
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:54,061
it's disturbing that that's actually an
engineered idea that they want stuff to

344
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:57,460
break. That's not what we
want when we want to stop.

345
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,850
What people really appreciate
his stuff that's durable,

346
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,160
but your mass consumers to blame
ourselves because like I dunno,

347
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,980
I get in a modern car like a nice
fancy car. Uh, and, and if people go,

348
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,780
God, it's 140 grand this you
Porsche of blah blah blah,

349
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,050
but I drive it and go man,
hell on earth.

350
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:20,860
Did they get it to do all this
neat shit for only 140 grand?

351
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,830
That's true all the way through to
people go on to box stores and buying,

352
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:24,101
you know,

353
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:29,101
a backpack for the kids for school and
they want in 1995 or 1295 backpack.

354
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:34,020
Now granted they'll replace it four or
five times because it's a heartless pilot

355
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,440
poo that no one cared about
versus buying one from, I dunno,

356
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:41,650
fill center Tanner goods or one of these
upcoming passion-based brands where

357
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:46,540
maybe it's an 80 or $120 bag, but the
kid alone it, you know, for 20 years.

358
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,080
Right.

359
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,080
So I think that's part of the reeducation
of the consumer that hopefully in turn

360
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,900
will insight and motivate manufacturers
large and small to re prioritize what

361
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,460
drives design.

362
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,110
Are they mutually exclusive when it comes
to options like magnetic ride control

363
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:07,150
and all this crazy shit
that they have now,

364
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:11,840
these sensors that adjust to the fact
that one wheel slipping and they counter

365
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:15,520
and all this traction control and
stability management and all this jazz.

366
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,550
Isn't that stuff just going
to break? I mean, yeah,

367
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:22,430
I mean the traditional answer they'd
give you if you asked to, you know,

368
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,200
top ag engineer, he'd say, oh,
but it's all computer based.

369
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:28,210
So as is no veiling pots.
Yeah.

370
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:30,600
But their circuit boards
that take a shit and solders,

371
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,180
that split and code that
becomes corrupted and on and on,

372
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:37,750
a nice tire that you can change in
the side of the road, exact shits out,

373
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:38,290
you're fucked.

374
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:43,290
And the biggest issue is trying to get
those parts to support that vehicle when

375
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,680
you are the last of the Mohicans who's
trying to keep it on the road and keep it

376
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:48,910
going.
You know,

377
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,840
most manufacturers could give it to him
and as soon as they're federally not

378
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:56,110
required to maintain those parts,
they want nothing to do with them.

379
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,010
So it gets to a point where like there's
cars that are classic that you're

380
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,370
always going to get parts for.
Like you're always going to get poor,

381
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:07,090
be able to get parts for like a 70 Chevy
Nova know because people love them and

382
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:11,920
there's a big market for it. But
like a 91 civic, it's like, Ooh,

383
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:16,510
what is that? Your dumpster diving
and that's, yeah, you're fuck kind of.

384
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,450
Yeah, that's a, it's a
weird thing that these,

385
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,580
there's some cars and some vehicles
that attain this classic status and then

386
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:29,140
they'll always be classic.
But like a 2010 Mercedes,

387
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,650
like nobody wants that. They just don't
want it. I mean, you might want it,

388
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:34,120
it's not,
it's not a terrible car to drive.

389
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,120
And you can resell them in Cuba for
big money, right? Yeah. Pretty soon.

390
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:40,150
Emerging market. Yes. But you know,
I think you just got back from there,

391
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,590
didn't you?
I saw some of your photos.

392
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,040
You must have been geeked out and
all those cars down there. Stupid.

393
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,010
I'm surprised I didn't

394
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,010
get arrested though because we went
there officially is like a guest of the

395
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,610
governing family on a arts mission and uh,

396
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,380
cause we sort of anticipated less
scrutiny at customs. I carried,

397
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,210
my backpack had literally about 95
pounds worth of vintage car parts.

398
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,760
So I figured out how to ingratiate myself
with the motoring locals in our hurry,

399
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:15,761
which was amazing because I got taken
to some crazy hoards and fines of really

400
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:19,880
wild early cars because of that.
But yeah,

401
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:24,260
I brought soldering guns,
soldering wire bulbs,

402
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:27,730
relay these,
all sorts of stuff cause they,

403
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,540
the ingenuity,

404
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,350
the resourcefulness of that country
in the spirit of the people is just

405
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:34,130
phenomenal.

406
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,180
We've talked about it a dozen times on
this podcast because I love the fact that

407
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:40,100
they didn't have access to new cars.

408
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,600
So what they did is they just
reconditioned and upgraded
and fixed all their old

409
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:47,810
cars to the point where those
Yank tanks is what they call them.

410
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,470
Those 1950s plus Chevy's and they're,

411
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:53,600
they're just driving them
around all over the place.

412
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,950
The vast majority of the cars on the
road are those or recent import Chinese

413
00:24:57,951 --> 00:25:02,030
vehicles because the Chinese government
kinda got in bed with them and partnered

414
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:04,850
on import automotive
distribution companies. There's,

415
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,290
I just wrote about it for 'em,
um,

416
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,200
the automotive editor for Penthouse in
the article that comes out in the next

417
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:15,260
issue, which I don't think anyone
fucking reads, but I enjoy writing them.

418
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,630
Someone should read a pen
house. But anyway, um,

419
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,090
was about that and the change in
the culture. But it's interesting,

420
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,170
they've actually recently passed a
federal law there that makes it illegal to

421
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:32,171
export any of these vehicles because as
they loosen the restrictions on inbound

422
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:36,950
vehicles, they anticipated potentially
there'd be a reduction in the demand.

423
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,520
But I don't think it's going to happen
from all the people that I talked to from

424
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:45,470
all walks of life there. It's become
like a, it's a cultural icon to them.

425
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:50,360
So, and I think it expresses a lot of
the human spirit and Cuba and how they've

426
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,700
presser veered and managed to make
things work with what they have.

427
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,060
But I mean, most of them that I
drove around in like, you know,

428
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:04,061
you'd be in a 57 Chevy Bel air convertible
and it's running a 70s Russian Volga

429
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,420
diesel. Really? That's actually,

430
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,380
I was in Castro's ex,
uh,

431
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,790
late sixties limousine. We rented
three of his limos and the fleet,

432
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,571
or didn't really rent,

433
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:22,571
but it was a friendly arrangement to
drive out a couple hours out of Havana to

434
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:27,440
go look at a very rare Aston
Martin that I knew about.

435
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:29,750
That's the only one in the country
that had been abandoned there.

436
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:32,210
That's a one of one early Aston.

437
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:37,810
So we drove these crazy old rush and
limousines to go for there and I ended up

438
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:41,730
on the side of the road twice having to
fix them. And then again, like we were,

439
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,580
we were going out to hear drunk at like
two in the morning and our Russian law

440
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:50,460
to taxi cab broke down.
Uh, it was pretty funny.

441
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,790
So I have some pretty funny
pictures of my cabby looking at me.

442
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:57,480
Just completely incredulous.
I'm underneath the car with bailing water,

443
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:03,000
cubing it up, cubing it up. So how
were they keeping these things running?

444
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,470
How they get access to parts?

445
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:09,471
Are they manufacturing their own
parts or they re re anything?

446
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,430
Yeah. I mean if for example, it's a
tourist, if you forget your toothbrush,

447
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,330
you're going to spend three days
trying to find a fucking toothbrush.

448
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,340
So where do you think you're going
to get a brake drum for a 48 olds?

449
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,340
So did you stay at a hotel
when you were at? Yeah,

450
00:27:25,341 --> 00:27:27,000
and some people stay at people's homes.

451
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,230
That's a big new trend and I'd
recommend it. Same with the, uh,

452
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:33,500
the home restaurant industry
that's growing there.

453
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,830
The backstory to that is there was a
recent limited allowance that allowed

454
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:41,370
private individuals to
create small businesses.

455
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,340
So people are opening up their homes,
they're

456
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:50,160
repurposing these beautiful derelict
old buildings and opening magnificent

457
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:52,850
restaurants in them.
And well,

458
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,030
magnificent might be a strong word because
the food kind of sucks, but really?

459
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,430
Yeah. Well cause they can't,
again, they can't get anything.

460
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,650
So like the food that's
imported comes from,

461
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,780
and what the government said they could
import from who they could say it it

462
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:11,710
from. So unless the dude has his own
farm and garden and herb resource,

463
00:28:11,711 --> 00:28:15,540
which a lot of them do, it greatly
limits what ends up on the plate.

464
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,250
But so it looks cool.

465
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,440
They just take people in and they have
like two seats at their kitchen. Yeah,

466
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,630
I think they're called Pella.
Doris I think is the word.

467
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:29,250
And some of the best meals in experience
in discussions in human interface we

468
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:31,590
had were in those
environments is super cool.

469
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:37,010
So are they or do they take like
a broken part and reconfigure it?

470
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:39,240
Did they make a new one or they,

471
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,160
I mean it's everything from Jb weld,
chewing gum,

472
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:49,161
duct tape and corks and coat hangers
through two incredibly gifted,

473
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,650
resourceful,
generally the older generation.

474
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:57,240
And I met one guy in particular in his
eighties who's very well known down there.

475
00:28:57,241 --> 00:29:00,570
There's a big car club called
Friends of fun GL. So fine.

476
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:04,710
Joe was a great racer back in the fifties
who in fact one the first big Havana

477
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:09,480
rally and there's this magnificent poster
that's like the holy grail of Car Geek

478
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,570
posters. I still want one,
can't find it. But anyway,

479
00:29:12,571 --> 00:29:17,010
the second year he went there to compete
again and Castro had him kidnapped

480
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,820
because they didn't want him winning
because he was an Argentinian. Oh.

481
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:22,410
And then they were like,
he can't win.

482
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,320
So they held him captive and apparently
treated him quite well and didn't

483
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:27,000
release them until after the race.

484
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:32,001
But this friends of find Dzhokhar club
is founded by one of the local guys who

485
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:37,521
was on his mechanic team that first year
and he knows everybody with anything

486
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:40,010
that has a motor and wheels and the,

487
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:44,320
he took me to meet this older gentleman
and this guy will not only make the part,

488
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:48,880
he'll make the tool needed to make the
damn part. So they're forging and casting.

489
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,420
Wow.
They're on stuff and it's phenomenal.

490
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:56,860
Like we could learn a lot of lessons
and macgyvering shit back together from

491
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,720
them.
Well that is one thing that we're,

492
00:29:58,721 --> 00:30:01,540
we're missing and we're losing the people,

493
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:06,520
the skilled crafts from that have
the ability to make metal pieces,

494
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,510
which we used to be a big thing. I mean
there are people in the hot rod world,

495
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:11,141
it's a big thing.

496
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:15,460
Fabricators are very high in demand
because they do so much custom work.

497
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:18,910
But it's such a tiny,
tiny fraction. But again,

498
00:30:18,911 --> 00:30:20,830
I think if we step back,

499
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,630
the thing that keeps me from becoming
a depressed drunk is the feeling that

500
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,850
that's changing.

501
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:32,440
It's becoming more important to
the greater general population.

502
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,270
People are more inspired and be
it in metal, be it in leather,

503
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:40,390
be it in soup, be it in cutlery,
whatever the hell it is.

504
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,020
There seems to be a growing trend and
people giving a shit and returning back to

505
00:30:47,921 --> 00:30:48,550
that.

506
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:53,080
And I think also more importantly
perhaps feeling how it changes them as an

507
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:54,700
individual.
So like for me,

508
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:59,701
my past life I had a completely
different career and I wasn't really,

509
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:05,380
I got into it loving it and over the years
like I really didn't have the control

510
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:10,000
and creative input that I thought I did
despite putting my heart and soul in it

511
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,730
or a past a point despite
getting dispassionate about it.

512
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,290
And it starts to kill your soul.

513
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,050
When I was young and dumb
and we didn't have kids yet,

514
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:20,980
my wife and I spontaneously
basically quit our jobs.

515
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:25,810
And started our automotive,
the first one, TLC. I mean,

516
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:29,500
it could have totally screwed up
and not work. I'm lucky that it did,

517
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:33,410
but I think most epically
important, it, it,

518
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:38,200
it reinvigorated me as an individual.
So I am,

519
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,140
I'm more proud and passionate and content,

520
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,200
which in turn hopefully
makes me less of an asshole.

521
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:46,690
The rest of the people that I
interface with him on this planet.

522
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,570
So I think big cultural sense,

523
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,940
that's a wonderful thing that I'm seeing
and it's not unique to America. The,

524
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,640
the ripple effect is really,
yeah. I think around the world,

525
00:31:57,641 --> 00:32:02,080
people are wanting to return to
those values. Well, and it's also,

526
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:06,190
there's something about like if, if
someone drives, like say one of your, um,

527
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,580
Fj forties that you re-engineered,
they kind of,

528
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,010
they're driving around in a piece of art.

529
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:17,280
It's not just a car that like
those volcanic black ones that you,

530
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:22,360
I mean, that's so, it's so, I mean, I
con but it's so iconic. Thank you know,

531
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:27,190
it really is it, it's your thing
like [inaudible] now it's art,

532
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:32,020
man. That's my whole approach is like it
should be, it's a functioning sculpture.

533
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,490
There's art. Even in the way your doors
closed, like I was, I shut your door.

534
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:39,380
I don't if she knows like in your showroom
like four or five times because it's

535
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:40,160
just so

536
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,270
well done. It's not, there's nothing
wonky. It's just clink, clink.

537
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:48,050
It's just you could feel that and like
I think when people drive something that

538
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:52,400
or use that guy's knives or you know,
or this clock that we have here,

539
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,750
it's like you feel the craftsmanship
and in Poughkeepsie on a more important

540
00:32:56,751 --> 00:33:01,190
level. Yeah. Whereas like if you have like
a cool piece of electronic, it's cool.

541
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,930
You know, I love a cool iPhone or a cool
laptop, but I don't, I love this laptop.

542
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:09,140
I write all my jokes on him. I
do it right. All emails and jazz,

543
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:12,800
but I don't feel anything out of it.
This isn't like some guys creation.

544
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,260
It's not a relationship.
Yeah.

545
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,040
Some women didn't carve these keys with
her skilled hands and I feel it when I'm

546
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,370
typing no to this.

547
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:26,240
It's kind of manufacturer and it's cool
that that can be done too. But there's a,

548
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,340
there's another level of stuff.

549
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,900
There's another level of feeling that you
get from functional art. Yeah, totally.

550
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,140
And you know,
like the,

551
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,160
probably the most sort of a two
expression of that brand theology is our

552
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:44,140
derelicts, which some people
like just don't, you know,

553
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:48,470
I had ran into a guy came running
up at a stoplight this morning.

554
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:50,870
I was test driving a 54 desoto,

555
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,270
explain what a derelict is because people
think you're talking about bums kind

556
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:54,530
of.

557
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:59,530
So basically a derelict is where
we'll take a car with epic Patina,

558
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,290
like just timeworn natural decay,
but not a rust bucket.

559
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,570
So like a barn find, we'll take
that car, we'll laser scan it,

560
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:12,770
get it into cad, chuck the original
chassis and mechanical and everything,

561
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,880
and evolve that into a modern,
highly capable daily driver.

562
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,150
But the art is trying to make
it look like we did nothing.

563
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:25,220
So this guy had a light. He's like, you
think you're going to make it? I'm like,

564
00:34:25,221 --> 00:34:29,510
yeah, I'm good because we got to
fix it up. I'm like, Nope, I'm done.

565
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:34,730
Well, what color? You're gonna paint it
red? Nope, I'm done. What? I don't get it.

566
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,130
So, but to me that's kind of
part of the fun. Well what these,

567
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,380
everyone does get it.
They look like an old car,

568
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:46,640
but you put this desoto up on a lift
and showed it to me and it's got this

569
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:51,230
insane, fully independent suspension.
And this is the, that's the icons.

570
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:55,670
But the, if you find [inaudible] are
elected will come right up. Yeah.

571
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,400
Um, or the derelict, not a reformer,

572
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:03,170
but these cars look on the outside
as if it's just an old car.

573
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,620
But then you look down the wheels like,
Hey, wait a minute. What's going on here?

574
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,770
And then he got kind of
like, oh, hold up a second.

575
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,940
You have modern corvette engines in
the just bad shit. Oh, it's insane.

576
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:17,510
Like what is this one right
here? This, that power power.

577
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:21,760
And asked her what a great man. So that
car was inspired by the first derelict,

578
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,390
which is mine, which is a 52
desoto wagon. So like in this,

579
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:27,950
it has a one off chassis.

580
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:32,300
We partner with Art Morrison on most of
our chassis engineering and we gave it a

581
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:36,770
gold tooth, like a crock because it had a
cavity. I was just kind of fun. But yeah,

582
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,310
like five 50 horse, a SRT, eight
Hemi fuel, Lee, five speed,

583
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:45,530
automatic independent suspension,
six piston, hydro boosted breaks,

584
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,020
Modern Climate Control, Bluetooth,
audio, blah, blah, blah.

585
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,560
But all like packaged in head and
so it's totally under the radar.

586
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,850
Totally under the radar to the point where
the knob that controls the old school

587
00:35:56,851 --> 00:36:01,851
radio actually controls the volume on
this Bluetooth enabled system that syncs

588
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:06,120
up with your phone. Yeah, it's,
it's an incredible digital bit.

589
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:10,680
One Addis and not digital to analog,
but pure digital audio.

590
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,603
Kind of love the,

591
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:16,740
it's amazing what you're doing
is so cool because like someone,

592
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,590
if they didn't know and they
looked out on the outside,

593
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,320
they literally have no idea, but then
you would look inside and go, wow,

594
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:27,060
that is a really well preserved
interior by minute. What's that?

595
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:32,010
It just looks off. I like onions,
so if you start peeling back,

596
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:35,380
there's a lot of layers
to the absurdities in,

597
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,150
in building these and then that video,

598
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:41,880
and she gave me a hard time for my
hat after six had, it's all fucked up.

599
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:44,040
I thought it was perfect. That's
perfect. There are assholes.

600
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,480
I'll give you a hard time about everything
you could to save babies all the time.

601
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,420
We have too many babies.

602
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:53,421
A trill trollers used to just rip me a
new one and over the years it's gotten

603
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:57,090
better is I think people have gotten a
more thorough understanding of what we're

604
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:59,820
doing.
Well also trolls are like snake venom.

605
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,710
You'd get a little bit and it fucks
you up, but over time it becomes,

606
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:07,140
you become immune to it
and they actually help you.

607
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:11,700
People were like overly critical and
assholes and they actually help you in the

608
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:14,940
long run. They really do because they
make you understand that. It's just,

609
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:19,260
there's too many people. You can't just
pay attention to everyone's opinion.

610
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,850
There's just too many fucking people.

611
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:24,510
They just remind you that we could use
a little Darwinian trimming of the herd.

612
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,990
There's that, but it's
also, it's really on them.

613
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:32,310
What is this fucking thing you've got
here? This customer total shit like God,

614
00:37:32,311 --> 00:37:36,900
this Si the interior was just nuts. Oh
my God. It's amazing. That's beautiful.

615
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:41,930
So that's that 50 Buick Roadmaster
convertible last on the road in 1958 we,

616
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,020
one of our hunters is
actually a ups driver.

617
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,430
Saw that in some dude's backyard and
had tipped us and we grabbed it back up.

618
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:55,380
Hold on. Or what is that? A ups drivers
to the best hunters. Really? Yeah.

619
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:58,230
We pay finder's fees to them all the time
cause they're delivering packages and

620
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:03,180
they see something covered by
leaves guys, guys, fucking car.

621
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,400
God,
those seats are incredible.

622
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:10,140
That one's now running a about
a 600 horse ls, seven dry some.

623
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:16,170
That card is applied now. Who's got that
thing that's a calling client. Yeah.

624
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,920
Remember the Super Bird, the 70 super
broom guys, former. We're building,

625
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:21,000
this is the same owner.

626
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:25,560
He's taking a superbird which is one
of the iconic American muscle cars and

627
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:30,040
putting completely modern underpinnings
that you were going to do a Hellcat set

628
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,620
up, right? Yeah.

629
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,410
Which is for folks who don't know what
we're talking about cause we're geeking

630
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:36,340
out here. Um, Hellcat

631
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,250
is the Chrysler SRT version,

632
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,850
the newest of their bad
ass challenges beast. Yeah.

633
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:47,740
It's what I drove on my comedy special,
the 707 horsepower red challenger.

634
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:48,760
It's fucking incredible.

635
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:53,761
So after talking to the creative
team in the SRT division at Mopar,

636
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,420
we actually learned that we're not
going to go that route. We'd like to,

637
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,290
but you talk about complexity in modern
vehicles without being too much of a

638
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,960
geek that that runs what's
called a can bus network.

639
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,670
So the electrical network in that car
is no longer yeses and nos x's and o's.

640
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,530
It's constant data stream.

641
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,280
So like even the dam don't light it could
be talking to the brake pedal that's

642
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:16,420
talking to the trainee.

643
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,350
So it makes it very difficult
to really engineer those right.

644
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:23,800
And a non native platforms.
So with SRT support,

645
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:27,400
we're actually going to the company
that builds their race engines and we're

646
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:31,540
going to do our own scratch
built scat 6.4 blown.

647
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,390
So we'll,
that's our performance target.

648
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,470
But we originally were just going to buy
one and disassemble it and repurpose it,

649
00:39:38,471 --> 00:39:42,190
and we got talked out of that.
That's crazy. The all that stuff,

650
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:45,790
but all that stuff has also enabled
them to have two keys. Correct.

651
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,350
Which is hilarious because one of them
that you give to the valet only gives it

652
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:54,700
500 horsepower. It's like, do
you know fucking fast? That is.

653
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:59,050
It's like here, take this tone down
version, and then the other one,

654
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:02,080
the red key gives you 707 horsepower,

655
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:06,130
which is incredibly manageable.
It's really weird.

656
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:08,650
It's so all the electronics
and all the jazz,

657
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,410
even 10 years ago when they
would do a performance model,

658
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,080
they'd just shoe horned in the
biggest motor they could find.

659
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:19,240
That car to me is a great example
of change, good change in Detroit.

660
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,390
It is so engineered to be what it is.

661
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,470
It's not just throw a motor in it and
sell it. No, they, it's really drivable.

662
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:29,980
It's almost like a gt car more than it.
There's a sports car, even a muscle car.

663
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,730
It's like a, it feels like a
big Cadillac your ride there,

664
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,390
but it'll suck it down when you need it.

665
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,140
When you stomp the gas on
its speaking speak epic.

666
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,360
That duality of the two different keys.

667
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,240
There's an engine builder out
near our shop. This guy a motor,

668
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,770
it's like his trainer motor has entry
level motors like Ooh thousand horse if

669
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:53,560
that's the alien import. The alien
a Ma intake manifold guy. Is that?

670
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,420
Yeah, the one that Nelson racing with
her legs open. Is it Nelson? Nelson?

671
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,000
Tom Is evil genius but oh
God, that guy's crazy. Shit.

672
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,150
Dual gastic.

673
00:41:03,151 --> 00:41:07,210
So you've got a toggle switch under the
dash there is dual computer networks,

674
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:10,420
dual tanks,
dual injectors.

675
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:15,310
So you've got your low output at a
thousand hearts and then it flick of a

676
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:16,144
switch,

677
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:20,850
it goes to the jet fuel tank into the
other computer network and now it's like

678
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,090
2000 horsepower. Yeah, that
guy built an 1800 horsepower,

679
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:29,620
69 Chevelle for my friend, the white
one. But no, it's like a light blue.

680
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,900
We did a white one called
on fuck with Hubble.

681
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,970
That's the machine.

682
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:39,380
The badges says unfuckwithable and it's
quite true other than it's probably

683
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:42,780
going to rip itself in half within
five years. Well, it's also, you know,

684
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,060
the first corner on the first quarter,

685
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,750
the 200 horsepower portion is going
to beat you. We try and not do. Right.

686
00:41:48,751 --> 00:41:52,730
So although over the years
I've been pushing the envelope
with more and more and

687
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:55,650
more horsepower and it's hard to
return once you've gone there. I,

688
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,380
we try and never build what we call a
call to sack rides where it's so into a

689
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:05,120
corner of, yeah, wow, let's
2000 horsepower. But it
overheats. If you stand still,

690
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:09,320
it won't idle. The AC won't
work, you know, or so much power.

691
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:10,400
It's not trackable.

692
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,840
Trying to keep everything
we do relatively practical,

693
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,250
so whatever performance we have,
it's in measure with the refinement,

694
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:23,030
the trackability, like the thrift
master pickups we're building,

695
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:25,320
people keep asking for more power.
Well,

696
00:42:25,321 --> 00:42:30,321
447 horsepower is what we have found to
be the maximum amount of power you can

697
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,180
put in it without it just being asinine
and never hooking up and just spinning

698
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:36,290
tires.
Yeah.

699
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:39,290
It seems like they might have painted
themselves into a corner with this

700
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:40,670
American horsepower war,

701
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,120
because when you get things like
the 777 horsepower challenger,

702
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:51,281
and then you've got the Mustang
Shelby that has six 62 and what's,

703
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,910
what are you going to
have five years from now?

704
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:54,860
You're gonna have a million horsepower.
What do you, what do we mean?

705
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,970
Where are you going to take it to? It's
going to, well, kind of like empires.

706
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,740
I think if you look at the history
of automotive design and trends,

707
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:04,250
there's always a kind
of a, a specific, uh,

708
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,640
graph of a rise and fall,
right? So I think, you know,

709
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:11,660
just as emissions laws came
in and impacted the first
air of the muscle cars and

710
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:14,690
the starting in 66 with dod and EPA,

711
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,100
I think you're gonna see the
same thing with these were the,

712
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,560
the corporate numbers will never allow
that kind of output vehicle to be

713
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:25,670
predominant because it impacts the ratio.
So, I don't know the exact numbers,

714
00:43:25,671 --> 00:43:30,140
but I would fathom to say that for
every three hellcats they sell,

715
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:35,530
they would have arguably
had better business selling
26 banger versions and the

716
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:39,350
final corporate fleet,
uh,

717
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:45,330
admissions of it is such that that
thing eats up so much of their allotted

718
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,260
emissions, they're able to
produce that, it limits them.

719
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,620
So I think that should
be a great opportunity.

720
00:43:51,621 --> 00:43:56,480
I think Cadillac is showing early signs
of embracing it correctly, which is,

721
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:58,640
okay, well let's get back
to craftsmanship. So yeah,

722
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:00,710
we can do this motor and
it's super sexy and all that.

723
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:05,360
But what about that plastic ridiculous
dash that we've turned into?

724
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,690
What about all this Foa
would, and like, Whoa, gee,

725
00:44:08,691 --> 00:44:11,180
why don't we start making
more quality materials?

726
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,660
Which I think could be a
really interesting opportunity
because on the other

727
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:15,590
side of the coin,

728
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:19,490
you look at what the Chrysler Fiat
ownership a Ferrari has done to Ferrari

729
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:23,000
product. You'll happen a new
Ferrari. The Nav Systems,

730
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:26,510
the same thing that's in your kids
jeep Rubicon. Are you kidding me?

731
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,620
And the plastic stuff that, oh, it,

732
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,790
well it has a sexy Porsche as
well that looks like aluminum,

733
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,020
but it's plastic.

734
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:37,380
It's just the same thing that's in a
Hyundai or a key or anything else and I

735
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:42,030
think they better be careful to hold the
line of that quality in that tactile,

736
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:45,420
that human interface or what's the
point? It's just a badge car. Well,

737
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:50,421
they've made some pro real errors in
navigation systems and not keeping them up

738
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,880
update and current because if you're going
to have all that electronic jazz hip,

739
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:56,250
better, better be good to go
there. Yeah. Yeah. Like A,

740
00:44:56,251 --> 00:45:00,780
I have a friend who is a Maserati and
this fucking piece of shit. Oh my God.

741
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,970
The navigation things.
Just dog shit.

742
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,210
But it's just Chrysler stuff that
some pencil pusher said, hey,

743
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:08,940
I already paid for this.
Let's stick it in the, no,

744
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:11,850
no traffic doesn't know where
the traffic is. Can Update.

745
00:45:11,851 --> 00:45:15,180
CanNot reroute you like [inaudible]
come on my fucking phone does all this.

746
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:19,290
Was this why like Ferrari and
Porsche to a certain extent as well.

747
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,230
I actually had more respect for them when
they were making less money. You know,

748
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,730
when, when like the era of
the air, it lasted the air
cold like a nine, nine, seven.

749
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,650
Yeah. There's no nav three, right? Yeah,
no, I'm sorry, nine, nine, three. Well,

750
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,920
I can picture some German guy
going via not sat drive his car.

751
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,050
There's no couple to either
fuck you, you know, and like,

752
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,720
but they had the balls to say, Hey, this
is what we are. We're not for everyone.

753
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:47,070
We have a backup camera.
It's a sports car. It is
minimalist. Deal with it. Dig It.

754
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,610
Great. Don't go buy a Miata. We
don't care. We are who we are.

755
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:55,470
Lotus is kind of doing that. They have
because they don't do that anymore. No,

756
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,910
I mean the little tiny,

757
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,660
those little tiny one I've been hearing
is lotus just making so much money off

758
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:05,661
of licensing tee shirts and product and
crap that the cars are kind of a pain in

759
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:11,700
their ass. So the engineering arm
is still alive and somewhat well,

760
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:17,430
but the cars, I mean, they had what,
seven concepts, uh, in the last two years.

761
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,990
And then production viability of
any and all of them is all but gone.

762
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,700
It just takes such deep pockets to get
one of those coach built versions of

763
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:30,430
those cars. Like what
singers doing, singer for it.

764
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,860
I see guys like Robin,

765
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:36,861
I I think it's viable that if we are the
creative sorts who are smart enough to

766
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:43,050
acknowledge that we're dumb enough to
not be the numbers sorts but to build our

767
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:46,200
team and add those people to the team.

768
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,590
I think we can make viable
businesses out of it.

769
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:51,810
Now the second you want to
make 50,000 a hundred thousand,

770
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:53,730
300 half a million of them a year,

771
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,930
I think that is the bigger
struggle because I think there's,

772
00:46:57,931 --> 00:47:02,931
there's conflicts at core with the
efficiencies that those business models

773
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,400
demand in the modern world
to be considered competitive,

774
00:47:08,401 --> 00:47:10,620
et cetera. It's like, you know,

775
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:15,621
with a Ferrari talking about coming out
with an SUV because you know some pencil

776
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:20,100
pusher, stockholder of power somewhere
like we need more market share.

777
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:21,630
You need to come up with something else.

778
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,970
I mean even when Porsche with
the Cayenne and stuff like yeah,

779
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:30,100
it's off core, but I can understand
the business numbers made perfect sense

780
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,720
to grab a Torah egg and package it
up in one of those Cayenne turbos.

781
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,260
They're a fucking spaceship.
Yeah, it's a spaceship.

782
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:41,920
It goes zero to 60 in four seconds and
it's a fucking truck and it handles like

783
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:45,820
it's on rails. It doesn't even make sense.
It defies the laws of physics. I agree.

784
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:50,740
Same with the new uh, turbo.
A Panamera that's, oh yeah.

785
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,980
Oh my God. That thing's in love.
That trainee, that PDA. See,

786
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:55,330
I want to take a car like that.

787
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:59,500
Package that fucker into
an old three split window.

788
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:03,040
Three 56 [inaudible]
has an all wheel drive,

789
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:07,960
like six 60 horse PDK paddle shift.
But what does that thing weigh?

790
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:10,990
Those things didn't weigh 2,500 pounds.

791
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:16,020
So is that the amount of
power for 2,500 pounds?

792
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:19,320
That'd be so crazy. By the time you
stuff all that crap in there, it's,

793
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,720
you're going to be back up to 4,000 but
it's still be a hell of an e ticket ride.

794
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:26,620
It would be insane.
The is there like is there a market,

795
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:31,621
like everyone loves those old cars so
people love like 69 Camaro's and those old

796
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:33,544
school cars.

797
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,690
Do you think there's a market for
someone to come along and do what singers

798
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:41,020
doing?
Cause what singer is doing is taking your,

799
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:46,021
when you buy a singer car it's technically
a nine six four which is like a 1989

800
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:49,090
Porsche.
But it's not really,

801
00:48:49,091 --> 00:48:52,630
it's a carbon fiber body that drive
train is totally re-engineered.

802
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,910
He's using his,
he Cosworth still,

803
00:48:54,911 --> 00:48:59,520
I think you had a Cosworth engine so
he's got a 400 plus horsepower, uh,

804
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:03,880
air cooled like the pre, I mean air
cools kind of a stupid way to do it.

805
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:08,881
But there's the people love that sound
that the air cooled produces and it has

806
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:12,510
such a mechanical sort of
an engaging feel to that.

807
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,580
You know that there's that field that
those engines have that people fall in

808
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,180
love with.

809
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,720
So he's got this kind of like very niche
market or niche market if you don't

810
00:49:22,721 --> 00:49:24,280
like me re butchering that word.

811
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:28,090
But is there a market for someone
doing that with an American car?

812
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:31,420
Like building a 1969 Camaro today,

813
00:49:31,421 --> 00:49:33,910
like a reengineered Camaro?
Certainly.

814
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,470
So I think traditionally there's two
ways it's been done and there's a pending

815
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:40,270
third way it might be
able to soon be done.

816
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:45,010
Traditionally you've got a guy who
doesn't give a damn respects quality,

817
00:49:45,011 --> 00:49:46,180
finds a pro builder,

818
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:49,570
and there's plenty of geeks like us out
there who do exactly what you're talking

819
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:52,720
about.
And they build six digit super freak,

820
00:49:52,721 --> 00:49:56,290
super trick for that dude.
One car and that's it.

821
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,930
Build one and all the engineerings
applied to that one car.

822
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,540
Then you have the professional
quote unquote shops that Cmr kit.

823
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,030
So they see that car on Barrett Jackson
and it sells for two 50 and they'd go,

824
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:10,160
well shit, my friends got some
six to nine in the backyard.

825
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,000
I can put those together, make them
shine, and we'd get some money.

826
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,510
If you're talking about that guy fast
and loud, aren't ya? I don't know.

827
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,000
I have no personal issues
with him. No, but it's,

828
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:23,150
it's just like show people see an opera.
It's, it's more the wolves, you know,

829
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,700
people that see an opportunity.

830
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,400
So then that's like Broncos traditionally

831
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,740
and, and, and it's not to say anything
negative about that community, but the,

832
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,190
the shop owners go,
okay,

833
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:39,260
what is the perceived tolerance of
the guy who might call me and wants a

834
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:44,210
restored Bronco and right or wrong,
that may have been 40 grand, 50 grand.

835
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,500
So then what do they do?

836
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:49,670
They go and they try and make a feasible
business model of delivering whatever

837
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,660
the hell they can at that
perceived market tolerance.

838
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,850
So you either have the guy who won off
builds for the occasional funded guy,

839
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,850
you have the slightly more
commercial versions of shops,

840
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:06,851
which in mass tend to cut corners or
make sacrifices to me to perceive market

841
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:13,870
three, you've got the new breed of
fools like me and robid singer and,

842
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:18,140
and more and more guys who
throw caution to the wind,

843
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,360
ignore the established price tolerance,

844
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:24,890
focus on the quality and
then try and build a market
from scratch. In the future.

845
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,401
There's,

846
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:30,040
there's a house bill that just got
presented that has been promoted by our,

847
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:31,790
our big trade group called Sema,

848
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:36,620
which is going to really work to create
a new federal classification for ultra

849
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:41,621
low volume vehicular manufacturers
will take responsibility for tailpipes

850
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:46,661
emissions but get exemptions from larger
impact mass market vehicle crash test

851
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:50,660
certification, which makes it
impossible. But it look, you know,

852
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:55,310
we can only build 200 a year,
300 a year if that law passes.

853
00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:00,350
I think people are going to be shocked
how many geeks in the fringes like us and

854
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:05,210
like us that are not branded yet that
have the engineering prowess and resources

855
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,280
to do exactly what you're talking about.

856
00:52:07,281 --> 00:52:11,000
Like that body for 69 Camaro and
by that entire body brand new,

857
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:16,070
you can almost buy that whole car via
mail order and Lego together in Boston

858
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,660
over the winter. Like companies
like year one. Yeah. And,

859
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,990
and I think there's issues there
with quality control licensing deals,

860
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:29,020
making the OEMs and forced quality with
the license so that this emerging market

861
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:32,030
doesn't step on its own dick
because nothing fits anything.

862
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:35,930
And there's plenty of concerns there,
but bigger picture,

863
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:41,300
the capabilities of the shops and the
resources and the tooling and all this

864
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:43,580
stuff coming together.
If this law comes into play,

865
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:49,090
you're going to see an immediate new
subculture in custom vehicles built to a

866
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:54,920
very high level at a more and more
feasible price point because we'll all get

867
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:59,240
that, that scale. And like as of
today for me, when I'm these Broncos,

868
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:02,930
I'm paying triple a
day for the old bronco.

869
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:06,770
I need to restore and modify
into my final equation.

870
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,710
I'm paying triple what I paid before I
open my mouth and we came out with them

871
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:15,950
and they're there. It's a shrinking.
So you've kind of fucked yourself.

872
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,080
Totally free market. Oh yeah. Ruined it.

873
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,720
So if I had had the
intelligence and finance,

874
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,090
I would a chip Monck away a
hundred of them. Well, you,

875
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,610
you were talking about this before,
uh, when we were in your lot,

876
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,830
when you were talking to me
about how you got into business.

877
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It's kind of on a bet and you chip Monck
the way a bunch of Fj forties and tried

878
00:53:34,141 --> 00:53:37,620
to create a market. Yeah,
he explained that. Okay.

879
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:42,710
Basically I've always been a big fan
of getting out of my little box and

880
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:46,860
traveling the world and
respecting different cultures
and viewpoints, et Cetera,

881
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:48,090
sides and a lot of traveling.

882
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,480
I found how it was incredible how often
you'd be in a really remote locale where

883
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,260
a vehicle is literally life or death,

884
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:03,150
how much the people loved
the land cruisers on a whole
different level than what

885
00:54:03,151 --> 00:54:05,940
North Americans dig about.
Artek cute. It's Kinda like,

886
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:09,510
it's Kinda like a safari vehicle.
Like no, like life of fucking death.

887
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:14,511
This is what gets you out of the Bush
live and people have such a deep affinity

888
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:19,110
for them. So back here in the states,
all my cars are over restored.

889
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:22,260
I want something for Fun
Dogs, Surfing Beach, whatever.

890
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,700
Bought an old FJ 40 like I had
grown to love on a, on a prior trip,

891
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,800
geeked out and restored it,
et Cetera.

892
00:54:28,801 --> 00:54:31,560
So I was at a business
class extension class.

893
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:35,730
I didn't go to college at USC and we got
into a debate over supply and demand.

894
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:38,250
Me and another student and the professor,

895
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,310
my theory was supply and demands bullshit.

896
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:46,170
Cause if nowadays if you control the
supply you couldn't create the demand.

897
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:50,940
They said I was an idiot back and forth,
turn it into a bat and I was given,

898
00:54:50,941 --> 00:54:55,941
I think it was six months to drive a
trackable market up 30 points and I think

899
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:59,760
it was like a thousand bucks
bed or whatever. So um,

900
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:05,330
although I was still active in my prior
career in my spare time and was spare

901
00:55:06,091 --> 00:55:06,361
money,

902
00:55:06,361 --> 00:55:09,360
I had already invested in
a couple automotive shops
just because I was already

903
00:55:09,361 --> 00:55:13,560
wrenching and restoring stuff in my
garage and helping these guys with their

904
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:17,820
business model but using their resources
cause I didn't have a lift in my shop

905
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,700
and my house.
So yeah,

906
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:23,760
went out and bought every FJ 40 worth
the rat's ass that I could find.

907
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,770
I did find you perhaps through,

908
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:30,480
I think about four 30
probably about 30 of them,

909
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:34,710
30 of them in six months. But
this is like thrifty nickel. No,

910
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:38,130
that was like two months real.
Yeah. Oh my wasn't working.

911
00:55:38,131 --> 00:55:42,180
I would say just road
trips rampage by 12 or so,

912
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:45,510
and then I call the transporter and
coordinate and send the 18 wheeler to go

913
00:55:45,511 --> 00:55:49,740
pick up those 12 and then keep going
called the other transport or pick up the

914
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:53,220
next 12 and then chip might come away.
I didn't geek out at first.

915
00:55:53,221 --> 00:55:54,990
All I did was fixed the problems.

916
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:59,430
They had clean them up really well
and then bring them back to market.

917
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,490
And this is in the day of the recycler
and the thrifty nickel and all that.

918
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,990
And it was like shooting
ducks in a barrel because hey,

919
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,300
culturally people dug them,

920
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:13,740
but there wasn't like a cult around them
and nobody was restoring them worth a

921
00:56:13,741 --> 00:56:14,100
damn.

922
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,150
They would like throw Leftover v eight
and a $20 paint job and chrome rims from

923
00:56:18,151 --> 00:56:20,610
their brothers,
El Camino or whatever.

924
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:24,430
No one was treating them
like conventional classics.

925
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,600
So that was just very simple
premise of give them more respect,

926
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:31,060
represent them better,
bring them back to the market.

927
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:36,210
I betcha there's a bunch of men and
women that dig them who aren't engaging

928
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:38,350
because of the quality level,
what they see.

929
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,720
And then luckily I was right and I went
back for them to pay me on the bet and

930
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,330
no one would pay me. They wouldn't pay,
you know the best. So what did they say?

931
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:52,330
It was just a joke dude. Just a
joke. You 35 cars fun as all hell.

932
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:56,980
I made out like a bandit. I've made,
uh, when you, when in fact those cars,

933
00:56:56,981 --> 00:57:00,670
the profit from those cars let my wife
and I piss off and go to South Africa for

934
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:04,450
like three months and have a killer
vacation when we were young and single.

935
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,890
And that's the vacation where we're
lamenting these dude's never pay it up.

936
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:13,330
But I'm like, but I think
there's something there. And
honey, you hate your job.

937
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,970
I don't really like mine
anymore. Fuck it. Fuck it.

938
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:23,920
Fuck it. I love these stories over hits
low. We get home. Let's just quit. Yes,

939
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,540
we're like, we were in our twenties so
we quit. I took like three credit cards,

940
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:30,520
20 grand,
my quiver of trucks,

941
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:34,480
a wing and a prayer took over my friend's
lease cause he wanted to move his

942
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:38,840
classic car shop to Santa Monica.
And literally like we put a post it note,

943
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:43,180
it was like 1200 square feet. I put
like, I dunno, five or six trucks,

944
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:45,850
glass window in Van.
I put the trucks in the window,

945
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:49,150
put a piece of cardboard on the door,
my cell number,

946
00:57:49,151 --> 00:57:52,390
and I'd carry around my old Motorola,
you know, Tan brick cell phone,

947
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:53,860
just go about my life.

948
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:58,330
And people started calling it
just like third truck we sold.

949
00:57:58,331 --> 00:58:02,140
We sold to a dude who's like, hey, if you
ever heard of the Internet, we're like,

950
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:07,110
yeah, we heard about that. Sounds like
what you're saying, these six, oh,

951
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:11,440
that was barely write and be
like, well, it sounds pretty
wild, man. He's like, yeah,

952
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:14,830
well I designed websites are
like, cool, what are those?

953
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:18,400
So we actually traded the FJ 40.

954
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:22,380
We sold this guy for a website.
Wow.

955
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:24,910
It was just, again, serendipity, uh,

956
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:30,290
has been so good to me that just shows
you how insane technology has changed in

957
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:32,050
just a short amount of time.
We have,

958
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:35,270
one of our sponsors is company
called Squarespace and you,

959
00:58:35,271 --> 00:58:37,960
you can make a website,
no bullshit in about 10 minutes.

960
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:41,470
And it's a bad ass website, drag and
drop. If you have a series of images,

961
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:44,590
it's so easy to do for
building online store.

962
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:49,750
You got to trade a fucking car
for a website nowadays for like I,

963
00:58:49,751 --> 00:58:53,140
we're redesigning the icon site, it's
going to go live in a couple of weeks.

964
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:57,880
And being the geek that I am like,
I'm like didn't want to Redo it.

965
00:58:57,881 --> 00:59:00,580
Our current sites, okay, no one's
pitch and it gets the job done.

966
00:59:00,581 --> 00:59:03,820
But apparently it's written
in some language of some
company that got bought by

967
00:59:03,821 --> 00:59:06,530
someone who got bought or got shelled
by the last guy who bought them.

968
00:59:06,531 --> 00:59:08,940
And then we got a notice that like,
well you know what?

969
00:59:08,941 --> 00:59:11,170
Browsers could be tomorrow.
It could be in a year,

970
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,430
but literally like a light switch,
my site won't be decipherable.

971
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:19,990
I'm like fuck. So if I'm going
to do it, I want to do it right.

972
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:24,991
So my director and I spent like eight
months geeking out and researching all the

973
00:59:25,581 --> 00:59:27,940
automotive sites, which I, you know,

974
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:33,160
got a lot of ideas of what to and what
not to do and my program or I'm like

975
00:59:33,591 --> 00:59:37,310
Mister America for manufacturing,
but my programmers in Afghanistan,

976
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:41,060
so other than my server freaking
out and then wanting to blog,

977
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,570
you're getting hacked from Afghanistan.
Once we got that cleared up,

978
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:49,100
this dude is a rockstar from Afghanistan.
He's got like 20 young employees.

979
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:50,720
He's fresh out of college.

980
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,740
All of his employees are college kids
were paying them way board then they're

981
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:55,880
used to making locally,

982
00:59:56,060 --> 01:00:00,350
but 10% what I was paying the fancy
pants agency in New York that to the old

983
01:00:00,351 --> 01:00:02,180
site. Wow. And overnight,

984
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:05,780
like I'll give them all the notes and
we'll do the layout at like 5:00 PM I come

985
01:00:05,781 --> 01:00:09,590
in at work, like there'll be
an email, it comes in at 5:00
AM boom, boom, boom, boom,

986
01:00:09,591 --> 01:00:10,910
boom, boom, boom. Everything's done.

987
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:14,910
Dude, get me this guy's number rocks
the house. Jesus fucking Christ.

988
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,600
I'm down with hanging out with Afghanis.
I loved that.

989
01:00:18,601 --> 01:00:21,300
I love that kind of strategy.
I love the fact that you just went for it.

990
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:22,680
I love people.
Go for it.

991
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,250
Don't sit around and fucking hate
your life for the next two days,

992
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:30,100
decades and Afghanis just yet again.
Another example of a guy who's like,

993
01:00:30,101 --> 01:00:34,390
there's no opportunity here. Life sucks.
I don't like my job, but wait a minute,

994
01:00:34,391 --> 01:00:36,430
maybe I could do programming for,
for you know,

995
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:38,650
the guy followed his
passion and yet again,

996
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:43,600
he's doing a great job in succeeding
commercially and personally because he put

997
01:00:43,601 --> 01:00:45,220
his heart and what he dies
and it does a good job.

998
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:49,200
Yeah, there's anywhere
it's possible and I love I,

999
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,470
one of the things that's
come out of this podcast,

1000
01:00:51,471 --> 01:00:55,640
it's been a surprising and amazing is
how many people have done the same thing.

1001
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:58,760
How many people that have listened to
these podcasts and God and listen to

1002
01:00:58,761 --> 01:01:02,870
people like you talk and just spread
their passion. Go fuck it. I'm doing it.

1003
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:06,710
And then just figured out a way to do
it on the weekends and nights after work

1004
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:09,140
and then put it together and
then get a viable business model.

1005
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,010
I tell you,
well,

1006
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:15,010
when you and I are 80
and we're not producing,

1007
01:01:16,191 --> 01:01:19,940
maybe we can't do anything anymore and
we sit back and we think about our lives

1008
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:25,310
outside of family and and and the
people in our immediate circle.

1009
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:30,490
I think the thing that we're going to
carry the longest term true pride about is

1010
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:35,831
having in little ways or big inspired
other people and made a positive impact

1011
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,200
and just like that,

1012
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:43,370
like the fact that this
podcast you probably when you
started that cow, whatever,

1013
01:01:43,371 --> 01:01:45,950
okay it will be a side thing on and
get rolling with it but it's turned in,

1014
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:50,450
it's created an entire community and
it's inspired other people like I've,

1015
01:01:50,451 --> 01:01:54,140
we call them our COO, my kudos
emails. So just being a goober.

1016
01:01:54,141 --> 01:01:57,870
If I'm on a blog or I am listening to a
podcast and I hear of another craftsmen,

1017
01:01:57,871 --> 01:01:58,940
I don't care what he's doing.

1018
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,700
Like the dude with the petrified
wood I was telling you about earlier.

1019
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,880
If I find there's somebody out there
following their dream and they're doing

1020
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:09,140
something that I think is killer, I'll
figure out bigger, small who they are,

1021
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:11,930
where they are. Get their email
and I always send out an email,

1022
01:02:11,931 --> 01:02:15,590
my subject lines always
Kudos and it's just dude,

1023
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:20,610
good for you. Well done. Pitch and
go forward. Proudy of that's great.

1024
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:24,120
And they're honest and they have
to be or this wouldn't happen.

1025
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:29,040
But it has turned into so many
friendships, opportunities
and relationships,

1026
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:33,330
collaborative projects like
it just, it's good, warm,

1027
01:02:33,331 --> 01:02:38,100
fuzzy karmic. And for both of you, when
the guy receives that email, that is fuel.

1028
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:41,670
That's the reason I started sending him
is because I started getting them and I

1029
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:46,290
noticed how it impacted and empowered
me to stick to what was important.

1030
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:50,370
And it's everything that, the thing
you were telling me about is that,

1031
01:02:50,371 --> 01:02:53,140
is that going to have a website? The
stools that he makes and the, the,

1032
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,570
the tables in the mix only seen him on
Instagram. And there's another one. Uh,

1033
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:01,920
tell me where it is again. What is the
name on Instagram? This, I got to find it.

1034
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,630
He's using petrified wood,
right?

1035
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:07,590
It takes petrified wood and then through
the cracks and the petrified wood,

1036
01:03:07,591 --> 01:03:11,130
generally like a trunk Helen
bed diodes in the thing.

1037
01:03:11,131 --> 01:03:15,300
So like at night it like bleeds
light and is like organic.

1038
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,930
There's this other dude who's in,
where is he?

1039
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,550
He's pedago way.

1040
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:25,580
I think the guy takes gourds and he carves
them in the most incredible filigree,

1041
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:30,960
intricate way.
Turns them into ceiling lights.

1042
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:36,740
So they broadcast this most incredible
spectrum of shadow and color and like

1043
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,830
it's a,
it's a fucking cord.

1044
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:44,920
The guy turns it into just like out there,
there's the,

1045
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:49,170
the Sanchez brothers or family,
three generations. Okay.

1046
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:53,490
This Mexican dudes in New Mexico
or Arizona and I think New Mexico,

1047
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:58,970
now they have state licenses
to pick up firewood.

1048
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:05,270
So they're out in the old growth areas
in the desert competing with dudes who

1049
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:06,630
are looking for firewood,

1050
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:11,100
but they're looking for fallen old
growth timber or standing dead.

1051
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:16,610
These guys take these pieces of wood and
we'll pick up turquoise and metals in

1052
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:17,760
that same area.

1053
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,290
They literally take them
back to their studio.

1054
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,050
And I don't know about the older
generation, but I've met the youngest.

1055
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:30,530
He'll sit back and stare at that would
roll a fatty and burn it and get intimate

1056
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:32,430
with the shape of the wood.

1057
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:37,230
And it can sit there for an hour or
five years until one day he's like,

1058
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,140
Oh yeah,
a chair.

1059
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:44,010
And he like sees the
vision of the shape in it.

1060
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:49,040
So they do like bowls and trays
and staircases and tables and shit.

1061
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:52,470
Gene of his would take
Fletcher's Instagram page.

1062
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:56,580
He put up this insane table that
someone did along those lines.

1063
01:04:56,581 --> 01:05:00,960
It looks like it was carved out of a
single block of wood and some guy had this

1064
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:05,450
really unique idea for
the side of a table,

1065
01:05:05,451 --> 01:05:10,380
like the front seat. When do it, what
was the guy's name that made those,

1066
01:05:10,381 --> 01:05:14,370
uh, the, the table too. I don't remember
the gourd or the table. I suck with names,

1067
01:05:14,371 --> 01:05:18,190
but I'll, I'll email it to you. I wish
we could pimp them on the show. But

1068
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:23,230
in another guy like that, there's a guy
on disability in Detroit who was, uh,

1069
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,530
increase the most gifted welder.
I've PR. I'm a damn good welder.

1070
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:31,090
And this guy's a rockstar. So his
name's Josh Welton Brown dog welding.

1071
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,700
He no longer can work because of these,

1072
01:05:33,701 --> 01:05:36,880
have these massive surgeries in both arms.
Fuck.

1073
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:40,810
But to just to keep himself
alive like his spirit alive.

1074
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:43,960
He started doing artistic
efforts with as wells.

1075
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:48,910
So this dude literally takes
scrap metal or old shovels,

1076
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,940
hammers them,
messes with them.

1077
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:56,950
Repurposes them and s does
these incredible sculptures
out of scrap metal water,

1078
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,050
no dogs and cars and whoa
that tables the table.

1079
01:06:02,051 --> 01:06:05,710
The kick ass. Yeah it doesn't,
I don't think he put a source.

1080
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,080
No look at that though.

1081
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:13,081
It's like it's all one giant block of
wood and I think it probably is sectioned

1082
01:06:13,691 --> 01:06:17,740
off on the left side that we can't see.
It's hard to tell but on the right side,

1083
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,180
the side that's facing us,

1084
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:22,750
it's sort of like steps like
you know what it looks like.

1085
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:24,620
He took in cuts of posts,

1086
01:06:24,621 --> 01:06:29,621
beams like for buys and sectioned them
in to like a butcher block pattern.

1087
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:34,100
Like guys who are doing that with
walls to where from like a paper,

1088
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,400
it's exactly what it looks like.
Right?

1089
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:39,670
It doesn't fit with your printer hub
of the wood that they don't use for the

1090
01:06:39,671 --> 01:06:44,671
paper pulp and you leave him at dis
similar lengths and you put them at 90

1091
01:06:45,491 --> 01:06:50,491
degrees on a wall and you do a whole wall
of and cut tree limbs look super cool.

1092
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:54,160
We've been doing more and more hardwood.

1093
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:59,170
There's a company called urban hardwoods
that sells tables like that. Jamie,

1094
01:06:59,171 --> 01:07:02,050
she would pull pulled out,
set up and they essentially,

1095
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:07,051
they take really cool old hardwood
chunks and make them these really unique

1096
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:12,340
tables.
They're not perfectly smooth.

1097
01:07:12,341 --> 01:07:15,850
A lot of them have like see if you
go to the gallery, if they have a,

1098
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:19,060
you could see some of their,
some of the stuff that they do,

1099
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:21,590
but then they kind of do this on a large,

1100
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,480
a fairly large scale and they go all over
the world or all of the country rather

1101
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:30,430
to find chunks of wood.
There's also like a auto aero art,

1102
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,980
I think it's called,
or aero art.

1103
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:38,250
The Dude's that take airplanes scrap and
repurpose it into furniture and stuff.

1104
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,020
So cool. Yeah. Well, this kind of, yeah,

1105
01:07:41,021 --> 01:07:44,890
the here you see these guys
actually taking the wood itself.

1106
01:07:44,891 --> 01:07:49,270
They'll have giant cranes carry
these logs. It's brilliant.

1107
01:07:49,271 --> 01:07:52,150
My Buddy Eric is a a
pool cue manufacturer.

1108
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:54,970
He's like one of the most
sought after in the world.

1109
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:58,840
He runs a company called sugar tree cues.
It's all completely handmade,

1110
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:03,430
all his own and he's one of those guys
who will drive around in his truck and if

1111
01:08:03,431 --> 01:08:06,670
he sees a log like off the side,
like he lives in New Mexico,

1112
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:11,820
he'll drive like a mile into the desert
and figure out a way to chop this

1113
01:08:11,861 --> 01:08:14,920
fucking iron wood into the back
of his truck and then make these

1114
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,980
pool cues with it with the most detailed
figures on mother nature has an inland,

1115
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:24,020
just let the natural Turkey,
he'll,

1116
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:28,730
he'll do points like he'll cut pieces
together but he doesn't like inlay.

1117
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:31,310
Like some people they'll,
there's different styles of cues.

1118
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:35,750
Some of them they'll inlay like abalone
are little pieces of bone or what?

1119
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:36,710
Mastodon.

1120
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:41,740
Ivory is one that he uses occasionally
for like the joint like 10,000 year old

1121
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:44,750
mass did it because apparently
that's super prevalent.

1122
01:08:44,751 --> 01:08:48,950
Like you can find a lot of that stuff
and it's actually been growing because of

1123
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:54,430
the crackdown on elephant ivory
that is actually created a,

1124
01:08:55,881 --> 01:09:00,760
a strong market spike. I was just learning
that and Africa last month, you know,

1125
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:04,520
but I used to do fine furniture, um,
as a highlight. I used to sculpt,

1126
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:09,320
paint pre-raphaelite style, do
woodworking. I did leather working,

1127
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:10,310
but these are all hobbies,

1128
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:14,570
just different things I'd explore and I
actually gave a couple minutes thought

1129
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:17,660
of making a commercial go of my furniture,

1130
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:21,470
but it was like add up the hours.
Like no, not going to happen.

1131
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:25,820
Like all quarter Sawn White Oak.
I'd fume it instead of standing at,

1132
01:09:25,821 --> 01:09:29,390
which is like way old school way of
doing it. That makes no sense. Hume,

1133
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:32,630
what does that mean? Fuming? You
basically create like a desiccant chamber,

1134
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:36,320
like a sealed chamber and
you put a desiccant in there
that sucks all the oxygen

1135
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:39,800
out of the year.
So that in turn surface cures the wood.

1136
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,180
And the longer you leave it in there,

1137
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:43,820
depending on the type of wood
and the coarseness of the grain,

1138
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,720
it'll impact and stay in the wood.
So like early Stickley,

1139
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:51,290
Gustav Stickley Furniture, arts
and crafts era stuff, most of that,

1140
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:54,770
a big part of its durability is
not just that it's quarter sawn,

1141
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,050
but that it's fumed ammonia,

1142
01:09:57,051 --> 01:10:00,630
fanny desiccant ammonia is what's
traditionally used. What does the,

1143
01:10:00,631 --> 01:10:02,550
what does desiccant,
what does that mean? Um,

1144
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:07,630
I believe it's the process of extracting
oxygen and moisture and that's what

1145
01:10:07,911 --> 01:10:08,970
ammonia does.
Yeah.

1146
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:13,220
Why you try and take a breath and your
desk and chamber when you're doing

1147
01:10:13,221 --> 01:10:17,570
something you're so unfilmed it looks
like maybe like a white oak and it gets

1148
01:10:17,571 --> 01:10:22,460
down to black at 32 hours.
Yeah. And they're dreaming.
It's not that calculable.

1149
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:25,220
It depends on the size and the grain.
And you literally,

1150
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,160
you put it in there and you make it
clear so you can just check on the bugger

1151
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,660
and let it sit in there and darken up
until you find that sweet spot they need

1152
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:35,540
is take it out and surface,
wax it or wireless and you're done.

1153
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:39,230
And if you get a gnarly,
uh, scratching it,

1154
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:43,580
that's not just on the top of the grain,
it permeates and really nice and deep.

1155
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:48,650
So like that thrift master you saw,
that's old Puget sound,

1156
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,700
sunken logs brought back up,

1157
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:55,970
killed quarter sawn and
processed and fumed.

1158
01:10:56,450 --> 01:11:00,840
But then we do a marine Matt seal for
durability because of that, you know,

1159
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:04,320
being a truck bed. But so I still
get a little bit of time to,

1160
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:08,300
to have fun with hardwoods.
We integrate them sometimes.

1161
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:11,900
Well if you decided to do that and put
the same passion that you put into icon,

1162
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:15,690
I'm sure it would be just as big success.
It's just one of those things. People,

1163
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,720
I mean I have,
the market's not as big I guess.

1164
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:22,890
Is it more people probably buy cars? Does
that make none? Doesn't he make sense?

1165
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,340
People buy tables,
chairs, couches and shit.

1166
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,260
It's just hard finding something cool.

1167
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:32,220
If you want to put like a cool piece
of furniture in your house, good luck.

1168
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:35,250
You'd have, you know, there's
some stuff that you can get it.

1169
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:39,000
Retail stores like restoration
hardware has some pretty nice stuff,

1170
01:11:39,001 --> 01:11:41,940
but it doesn't, yeah, he raised,
you're like someone just farted.

1171
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:46,860
That guy is screwed.
More heritage brands and designers,

1172
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,360
he'll steal your design,
lock,

1173
01:11:48,361 --> 01:11:52,110
stock and barrel and take it to market
weight to come after him and go, yeah.

1174
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:54,360
Sumi real ambig.
Uh,

1175
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:57,900
they did a horrible thing with the guys
that originally designed the famous

1176
01:11:57,901 --> 01:12:02,370
American navy aluminum tall chairs.
They just stole it, went to market,

1177
01:12:02,371 --> 01:12:03,750
had it made in India or whatever.

1178
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,800
But that's actually a very cool story
for people that care about these things

1179
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:12,570
that it's worth looking into. And they
no longer republic lead comment on it.

1180
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,950
But there was a settlement and the owner
of, what is that Navy chair company?

1181
01:12:16,951 --> 01:12:19,050
There's southern cal
company been around forever,

1182
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:23,080
I don't know since like the
forties. But anyway, he said,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1183
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,830
you're not going to screw me. Just
cause you're a big, and I'm little.

1184
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:31,220
And he leveraged everything he had to do
and did a big campaign to be made right

1185
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,753
and protect it.

1186
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,320
So they that the courts
upheld his complaint,

1187
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:40,050
shutdown restoration hardware's effort,

1188
01:12:40,051 --> 01:12:45,051
made them pay damages and they protected
this guys designed and trademark and

1189
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:49,460
brand shouldn't just be damages
when someone plagiarizes
like that or steals it,

1190
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:53,790
don't even get me started. Trademark
infringement, copyright violation.

1191
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:58,410
We go to trade shows and see designs that
I penned and developed and did the cat,

1192
01:12:58,411 --> 01:13:02,280
did everything myself and house.
I've seen the exact product, lock,

1193
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:06,090
stock and barrel on a supplier's
booth at Sema for sale retail.

1194
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,050
There's no way that guy say, dude,
what are you doing when you call me?

1195
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:12,330
You got my cell. Like you can make
that so much cheaper than I can.

1196
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:15,760
That would have given you my files.
We could have worked something out and go,

1197
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:19,440
hmm, yeah, that's business and
this. What do you sue them?

1198
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,950
How do you do deal with that? No, I
licked my wounds and walk away. Fuck.

1199
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:27,300
I just learned a lesson and go fucking
humans in business that but not all.

1200
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,080
Just a few like hunts.
There was,

1201
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:35,110
there's a rickshaw driver in Havana that
I realized after I'd given away all my

1202
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:39,840
car parts,
I had a tire patch kit still my backpack.

1203
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:43,230
And I remember this kid we had, we had
had a conversation, I speak Spanish,

1204
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:46,260
we'd had a conversation early
in the trip and like Ah,

1205
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,500
he'd appreciate that cause he
had been telling me like the,

1206
01:13:49,501 --> 01:13:52,920
the mafioso that you know,
runs the ric shawl rentals,

1207
01:13:52,921 --> 01:13:56,430
just like in the Greek New York cab deal.
If he gets a flat,

1208
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,510
he's got to bring it back there and they
charge him some ridiculous rate to fix

1209
01:14:00,511 --> 01:14:04,230
the flat and it's on him. So I, Oh
this kid will appreciate my kit.

1210
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:07,980
So late at night I find him, I give
him the kid, he's stoked, takes me out.

1211
01:14:07,981 --> 01:14:12,130
We just go for a drive and a
talk and he nailed it in broken

1212
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,680
English. She was saying the
difference between Communism,

1213
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:18,790
socialism and western capitalistic
driven things. It's like, you know,

1214
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:21,310
there's values in them all and
none of them work independent.

1215
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:26,311
And perhaps the perfect cultures of the
future would be a fusion of socialism in

1216
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:28,570
certain respects. Such as, you know,

1217
01:14:28,571 --> 01:14:32,800
education and medicine would have you
and but also the free market capitalist.

1218
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:37,000
He goes, but the end, he was explaining
to failures of each and he nailed it.

1219
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,910
Capitalism has no conscience.

1220
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,740
And to me that that's it.
That's it.

1221
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:49,741
If we can figure out a way to still
have brands and products and consumerism

1222
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:54,640
that has a conscience both to
its consumers, its shareholders,

1223
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:59,560
the environment like just to wake
up awareness, not this me, me, mine,

1224
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:03,350
Mine, mine, then that would
be cool. It isn't it the cat,

1225
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,460
the idea of capitalism is sort of
independent of the human being.

1226
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,990
It's like the idea of capitalism,

1227
01:15:07,991 --> 01:15:11,920
this idea of eternal growth that's
sort of independent of the human being,

1228
01:15:11,921 --> 01:15:14,260
but the human being practices,
capitalism.

1229
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:18,790
So it's up to the human being to have
conscience. So I think it's maybe I'd,

1230
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:23,530
I'd prefer to hope that what you just
described would be corporate TISM if that

1231
01:15:23,531 --> 01:15:26,950
was well, right, like a corporation,

1232
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:30,070
I can understand having no conscience
and then it's up to the individuals to

1233
01:15:30,071 --> 01:15:32,770
hold them to some level of accountability.
Yeah.

1234
01:15:32,771 --> 01:15:36,670
And I also please go just money for
the sake of money and capitalism as a

1235
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:41,020
priority. I think if we could put that
in check and reset those priorities,

1236
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,410
I think it would serve everyone
well on many different levels,

1237
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:48,640
but also I think that but what do I
know? I'm just some fucking mechanic. No,

1238
01:15:48,641 --> 01:15:50,980
don't you dare do that.
You're dead on.

1239
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:55,981
And I also think that it could be taught
whether it's just primary education or

1240
01:15:56,861 --> 01:16:01,750
whether it's being taught at in business
school that when you steal you're not

1241
01:16:01,751 --> 01:16:05,650
going to be happy. You're going to know
that what you did. Is it legitimate,

1242
01:16:05,651 --> 01:16:07,950
you're a fraud totally.
And that these, no,

1243
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:10,330
there's no way to go round
really relevant and important,

1244
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:14,500
which goes back to accountability.
Do you mean do something stupid?

1245
01:16:14,501 --> 01:16:18,040
Now I turn around and sue somebody. It's
like, well you did something stupid.

1246
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:22,450
Whatever happened is saying, oh, I fucked
up it. Just being accountable for it.

1247
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:26,610
Look what happens to authors when you,
you hear about an author or writer,

1248
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:31,620
a plagiarizing and they get caught and
then someone takes their work and shows

1249
01:16:31,811 --> 01:16:33,760
the, the original and like, look,

1250
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:38,761
there's 50 different examples of this
guy taking full passages from these books

1251
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:42,970
and, and repackaging it as his
own. That guy's done. Yeah,

1252
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,110
they're fucking done.

1253
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:47,950
And that's essentially what these people
are doing to do in the same thing when

1254
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:51,670
they get called out, they kind
of, they pay the lawsuits and the,

1255
01:16:51,671 --> 01:16:53,230
but they're allowed to keep practicing.

1256
01:16:53,231 --> 01:16:57,670
And that if we treated those companies
the same way we treat those writers,

1257
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,770
then things would really change.

1258
01:16:59,771 --> 01:17:03,070
And people looked at restoration
hardware and went, oh, you did what?

1259
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,660
Oh fuck. He goes, yeah, I'm going
to design within reach. Yeah,

1260
01:17:07,661 --> 01:17:10,100
it's more expensive.
But they work

1261
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:13,370
with these companies. The problem
is that history, it's a location.

1262
01:17:13,371 --> 01:17:15,380
There's a big building.
You'd go there and you know,

1263
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:18,250
I need a fucking couch catalog and
the like, those aircraft chairs,

1264
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:22,820
I'm damn jumped it. I am too.
But I'm like, not. Once I
heard that story, I'm like,

1265
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,410
I can't do it.
Can't support.

1266
01:17:24,411 --> 01:17:28,570
What you'd need to do is hire someone to
rip off their design of their air craft

1267
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:32,450
chair. There you go. Beat them
at their own game. Fuck. I mean,

1268
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,850
is that real? I mean, can you do that?

1269
01:17:34,970 --> 01:17:38,130
I can't think you can get
tapped though on education. Um,

1270
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,300
I think that's another thing that,
uh,

1271
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,850
is so important and misguided.
You know,

1272
01:17:43,851 --> 01:17:48,580
suddenly blue collar is a bad thing.
Well, I mean, I've got a neighbor who,

1273
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:51,860
a plumber, he's doing fine.
Don't worry about him. Yeah,

1274
01:17:51,861 --> 01:17:53,300
you can meet a lot of money,
blue collar.

1275
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:58,100
And I think that our school system,
not,

1276
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,320
not only not supporting that,

1277
01:18:00,321 --> 01:18:05,300
but not educating kids on the Plethora
of opportunities in the world for careers

1278
01:18:05,301 --> 01:18:09,560
and the importance of loving what you do
versus expecting people to fit in these

1279
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:12,950
silos of doctor or lawyer
or where's she at the,

1280
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:16,520
I'm going to take a two second half
cooked idea and I'm going to sell it,

1281
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,610
become an internet billionaire with
good luck with that. But it's like,

1282
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:23,390
it's like the Palae dreams of the
Brazilian kids. Like, oh, okay,

1283
01:18:23,391 --> 01:18:26,090
but I hope you got another plan.
But we're not even,

1284
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:31,300
we're not even teaching kids how to write
a check and balance personal finances

1285
01:18:31,551 --> 01:18:32,001
in school,

1286
01:18:32,001 --> 01:18:36,350
not to mention showing them the
opportunities the world has and help them

1287
01:18:36,351 --> 01:18:37,910
identify what they care about.

1288
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,050
We just kick them off to college where
they party for two years in a hopefully

1289
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,010
on their own,

1290
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:48,280
find something that matters to them or
they continue doing whatever they thought

1291
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:53,000
they were supposed to be doing and don't
discover what they love until it's too

1292
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:53,420
late.

1293
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:56,420
And if they get any inspiration from
their teachers or professors are going to

1294
01:18:56,421 --> 01:19:00,910
get these little nuggets that they have
to nurture like little embers the night.

1295
01:19:00,911 --> 01:19:04,190
It's not like a constant, not a
cultural education. Yeah, I think it's,

1296
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:09,220
Norway does a kick ass thing where I
think it's 10th grade you do an internship

1297
01:19:10,671 --> 01:19:13,910
with like first they sort of give you
the big picture and then you can pick

1298
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:18,320
where you want to do an internship and
then you do it and then your final year

1299
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:23,350
in high school is preparing you for the
career future that speaks to you that

1300
01:19:25,551 --> 01:19:26,690
you've already identified.

1301
01:19:26,691 --> 01:19:31,691
So when kids go into business right
away or off for further continuing

1302
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:36,290
education, they care about it
and there were already engaged.

1303
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:41,291
They're not just getting kind of churned
through this system where they don't

1304
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:44,150
even know what the hell they want to
do. So. So it's just making money,

1305
01:19:44,151 --> 01:19:48,200
charging them for a debt they'll carry
through their professional career. Well,

1306
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:51,740
it's also hard because the teachers
are so unmotivated here, so it's,

1307
01:19:51,741 --> 01:19:56,660
it's so difficult to get people and pay
them like a poverty wage and expect them

1308
01:19:56,661 --> 01:20:01,190
to be enthusiastic about
presenting limitless
possibilities to these kids. Well,

1309
01:20:01,191 --> 01:20:03,860
they don't even have limitless
possibilities in their
own life. They're fucked.

1310
01:20:03,861 --> 01:20:08,861
And some shitbag $40,000 a year job that
has a complete ceiling on it as far as

1311
01:20:09,511 --> 01:20:13,050
growth potential and as far as the
appreciation that people have for what

1312
01:20:13,051 --> 01:20:15,780
they're doing. And that's
something I struggle with. I mean,

1313
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,840
I pay over market in my world and none
of my people make what I honestly think

1314
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:21,984
they should.

1315
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:27,290
But if you look at the business model of
it and all the ridiculous cost of doing

1316
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:32,230
business and scale in America,
not to mention California it,

1317
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,160
it's like the business that I,
you know,

1318
01:20:35,161 --> 01:20:39,180
I see guys go to China or wherever
they go to make something feasible.

1319
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,950
We can bitch about that all we want.

1320
01:20:40,951 --> 01:20:45,951
But if we look at the entitlements and
taxes and all the crap that's developed

1321
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:49,980
around, it's like I di, I think these guys
should make double what they're making.

1322
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:53,700
Show me the business model.
Like literally I've been searching for it.

1323
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:57,780
I just finished reading a great book
called Spark, which is about Lincoln,

1324
01:20:57,781 --> 01:21:00,990
which is one of the earliest is
still one of the predominant welding

1325
01:21:00,991 --> 01:21:05,991
manufacturers in America and this guy
was doing revolutionary stuff with

1326
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:11,570
employee retentions and like he was
paying out such big bonuses that the bonus

1327
01:21:11,571 --> 01:21:16,571
is generally we're 110% of the
salary to all employees at all level.

1328
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:20,100
He would basically at the end of the year,
look at whatever the,

1329
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:25,440
whatever the taxable profit of the
company was and disburse it as bonuses.

1330
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:29,190
So you have to pay the tax and the IRS
got pissed and investigated them several

1331
01:21:29,191 --> 01:21:32,940
times, but it held up.
But now they have a proud,

1332
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:36,720
educated,
healthy workforce,

1333
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:39,300
some of which had been
there for three generations.

1334
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:43,950
There are multinational company,
they've managed to stay progressive,

1335
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,320
competitive and dominant.

1336
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:51,620
Having this model of this pay structure
in this community that goes against what

1337
01:21:52,231 --> 01:21:56,010
every economist that, I mean there,
this book is still one of the,

1338
01:21:56,011 --> 01:22:01,011
it started as a Harvard case study and
it's become the most common business case

1339
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:06,880
study ever in North American universities.
From what I understand.

1340
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:08,610
And is it duplicated?

1341
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,700
Is anybody tried to replicate what
they're doing and there's been different

1342
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:14,310
efforts but not to the
extent that they have.

1343
01:22:14,311 --> 01:22:18,600
And in fact they failed with it and other
nations because there become cultural

1344
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:24,030
conflicts with the viability.
But like I'm studying that,

1345
01:22:24,031 --> 01:22:29,010
like what could I do that we make
that work. But you know when you're,

1346
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,060
you know, California Shit, we're busy.

1347
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:36,720
We've got a one to five year
backorder on all the different icons.

1348
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:40,650
If I wanted dude's let's work harder.
Let's come in Saturday. Let's,

1349
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:44,100
I'll work Saturday. Everyone
came. It's not mandatory.
It's up to you, dude. I, okay.

1350
01:22:44,101 --> 01:22:46,650
Over time is one thing and
that's fair and reasonable,

1351
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,660
but all your workman's comp and all
your insurance is an everything rise

1352
01:22:51,661 --> 01:22:55,770
exponentially based on you doing that.
So like waiting a year,

1353
01:22:55,771 --> 01:22:59,670
d incentivizing me to
give my guys bonus income,

1354
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,840
increase our productivity and therefore
the productivity of the nation on a

1355
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,040
bigger impact company.
Not My little

1356
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:06,501
stuff,

1357
01:23:06,501 --> 01:23:11,501
but it makes it disincentivize
you to create more.

1358
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:14,080
It's more costs on top.

1359
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:18,790
It's hilarious that they were investigated
by the IRS for generosity. Yeah,

1360
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,900
basically. And it took him years
and years, but they, they want,

1361
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:26,620
hey look, it's so gross. You have
to fight the fucking government.

1362
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:30,180
Like who are you? Who are you? Yeah, you,

1363
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:33,640
you aren't you guys supposed to be
just protecting us from fucking war?

1364
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:38,860
What do you do? What are you doing?
You're investigating generosity. Yeah.

1365
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:42,610
No, nothing but fun. It's so bizarre.

1366
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:47,380
We didn't bore the car geek cannot hold.
No, no. I think you have a wider reach.

1367
01:23:47,381 --> 01:23:50,380
These, these, these people are,
they're, they're, they're loving this.

1368
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:51,910
This is great stuff.
This is fuel.

1369
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:55,270
Do you get a hard time to bring
it back to the car stuff too?

1370
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,360
Like the Desoto that you showed me too,
which is just fabulous.

1371
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:02,380
Do you get a hard time from people
that want to keep everything,

1372
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,840
numbers matching those Fuckos,

1373
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:09,970
those goddamn crazy there,
whatever the world,

1374
01:24:09,971 --> 01:24:14,530
and I'm okay with it. I just, if they
call me, I'm first one to go, dude,

1375
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,600
you're talking to the wrong guy.

1376
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:21,490
There's a desoto specialist in Kansas
that we'll do it down to the factory

1377
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:26,080
imperfections and chalk marks that
you love so much and joy. I mean,

1378
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,540
the way I see it,
Henry Ford was kind of a prick,

1379
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:31,990
but he was a genius and he said a couple
of clever things. My favorite being,

1380
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:33,910
there's an ass for every seat,

1381
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:37,120
so I don't expect what I do
to make sense to everyone,

1382
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:42,070
nor do nor that should be a two way
street. So there there's a place in that.

1383
01:24:42,071 --> 01:24:43,450
I think that's a dying market.

1384
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:46,630
I think that guy's somewhat
of a dinosaur in our market.

1385
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:52,210
People expect it to evolve, but there's
a finite number of those to Soto's.

1386
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:56,950
That's the argument against, but they can
eat me. I mean that's a station wagon,

1387
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:01,270
which traditionally no one's given a
shit about. They were work the hardest,

1388
01:25:01,271 --> 01:25:05,170
thrown away wet. No one cares. They
have the least amount of parts support.

1389
01:25:05,171 --> 01:25:08,710
They're the most expensive to restore
with the least return if you look at it as

1390
01:25:08,711 --> 01:25:11,170
an investment.
Here's a perfect example.

1391
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:16,230
I have a 1965 corvette and my neighbor
has a 1965 corvette and my neighbor was

1392
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:22,621
driving up the hill in his car while my
car was being returned to me from Steve

1393
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:26,770
Strope at a purely shave. Yeah, he's
the one who builds my car. He's nuts.

1394
01:25:26,771 --> 01:25:31,060
I love him. He's the best. Um, Steve, uh,

1395
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:35,620
my car is not stock at all
and this guy is bone stock.

1396
01:25:35,621 --> 01:25:38,420
This guy just ready.
It looks at you like you're just a moron.

1397
01:25:38,421 --> 01:25:43,090
Looked at me like I tried to feed Ted
Nugent a Tofu Turkey. It was a really,

1398
01:25:43,091 --> 01:25:46,570
the look on his face. He goes,
what? He goes, what is that stock?

1399
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:50,620
And it comes out with this fucking 35
series rear tires and like ruined it.

1400
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,610
He looked at me like I was a total,
it's not even nothing stocked.

1401
01:25:53,611 --> 01:25:58,611
I the only thing that stuck is the panels
the the entire frame or at least stock

1402
01:25:58,901 --> 01:26:02,890
anymore either? No, he actually got
it from, I got it from our motors and,

1403
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,580
and then shipped it to him and he did
all the extra work to it, but the,

1404
01:26:07,581 --> 01:26:10,520
the underpinnings and
everything was already done.
He's quite the craftsman. Oh,

1405
01:26:10,521 --> 01:26:13,460
he's a bad motherfucker. He's in it. He's
a mad man when it comes to that stuff.

1406
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:18,710
But the point is this guy,
but those cars are sort of precious.

1407
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:21,860
So 65 Corvettes are precious.
There's a finite number of them.

1408
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:26,180
And he looked at me like, what the fuck
did you do? I've gotten hate mail. Yeah.

1409
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:30,230
I've got a couple cars in the line that
we're going to do soon that are really

1410
01:26:30,231 --> 01:26:34,130
going to piss off the purists. But I
gotta tell Ya, it's part of the fun.

1411
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:38,930
To me that's 63 Ferrari or
we're going to build, oh my God,

1412
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:43,220
the Ferrari East does urgh just
going to lose their shit over it.

1413
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:48,800
Whatever. Yeah. Ferrari. Easters Dana
White, my friend who owns the UFC,

1414
01:26:48,801 --> 01:26:52,160
one of the president of UFC. Dana.
Yeah. He wanted an Fj for a while,

1415
01:26:52,161 --> 01:26:55,440
but he didn't like the wait
time. He disappeared on me.
Yeah, that's Dana Heath.

1416
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:58,760
He wants things guest today. What do you
got? You got anything right now? Let's go.

1417
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:04,460
Um, he has a test to Rosa and uh, he
always wanted a test to Ross and as a kid,

1418
01:27:04,461 --> 01:27:05,840
so he got some money,
got to test throw. So,

1419
01:27:05,841 --> 01:27:10,841
but he had the interior
completely stripped out and
he had everything completely

1420
01:27:11,691 --> 01:27:13,850
redone,
like modern stereo system.

1421
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:17,080
Totally new upholstery and people
who have found out about it,

1422
01:27:17,081 --> 01:27:22,010
but just appalling, I think even
changed the wheels. Just how dare he,

1423
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:25,670
but you can't do that where you can do
it with other cars. It's sort of like,

1424
01:27:25,671 --> 01:27:28,420
even with Porsche's, you
know, the r group, Porsches,

1425
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:31,070
they would take those scaled
out laws have become acceptable,

1426
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:34,670
like Magnus Walker's conditions.
Yeah. I love that guy too.

1427
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:39,290
He's a character he's been on here. Um,
you know what? There's three Ferrari's,

1428
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:41,120
his own for rise.
You don't do that.

1429
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:42,970
They don't do that with
also with Rolls Royces,

1430
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:45,980
which you're going to differ is that I've
done, I've pissed off the rover guys.

1431
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:49,490
This is the best vehicle ever. How would
you've ruined it? I'm like, well you,

1432
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:53,690
what you did unfortunately was get
peoples dick hard for something that you

1433
01:27:53,691 --> 01:27:55,400
don't want to do again because you,

1434
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,820
one of the things I asked you about it
right away, I was like, got defender.

1435
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:01,610
You're like, nope, nope, nope. Don't
do it. That's fucking do it. Don't,

1436
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:04,940
don't fucking do it. Do it.
If I cannot speak reason,

1437
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,120
pull out time defender video.
Put a icon.

1438
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:11,540
Defender one ten one 10 is
colored in the night. Oh my God.

1439
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:15,260
It's a fucking work of art. It's a
beautiful, beautiful cause. Suck.

1440
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:19,400
They're beautiful. But like whoever's
sketched, it was a rockstar.

1441
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:21,320
Whoever executed it was an account.

1442
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,110
Everything that could be compromised
was comparable. But as you said,

1443
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:28,580
in my opinion, these are
essentially, they were,

1444
01:28:28,581 --> 01:28:32,630
they were just utilitary vehicles or
utility vehicles, agriculture vehicles,

1445
01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:37,040
and they get great for what they were,
but they don't line up right.

1446
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:40,190
But it wasn't a priority. What do you
think about like west coast defender,

1447
01:28:40,191 --> 01:28:40,881
you know when he's doing,

1448
01:28:40,881 --> 01:28:45,320
he's taking these things and kind of like
re rebuilding them from the bottom up.

1449
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,760
Um, just a different kind of
thing. Totally different thing.

1450
01:28:49,761 --> 01:28:51,440
He's more respectful of the original.

1451
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:56,420
The most established company with that
approach is called East Coast rover.

1452
01:28:56,440 --> 01:29:00,770
He c. R they're held in the
highest regard with a tradition.

1453
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,040
The the west coast

1454
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,340
dude. I haven't met him. I've seen him
very nice. Got some media, good guy.

1455
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:08,940
But I don't know the
depth of their expertise.

1456
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:13,890
I do know that that car is a disaster
because so many people had been importing

1457
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:16,890
them and calling it
older than it really was.

1458
01:29:16,891 --> 01:29:19,650
And then there's crazy stories out there.

1459
01:29:19,651 --> 01:29:24,400
I mean the federal government has seized,
I think 60 68 of them were,

1460
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:27,500
they destroy the destroyer, which
is fucking crazy. If it's out,

1461
01:29:27,501 --> 01:29:31,440
if it's past like 95 I think
they've been in the right,

1462
01:29:31,441 --> 01:29:36,300
but then it turned into a cluster fuck
because of the story I heard was that

1463
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:40,920
when they were confirming by Vin
number with Land Rover corporate,

1464
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:46,080
they were only for privacy concerns giving
land rover the last six digits of the

1465
01:29:46,081 --> 01:29:50,010
ven. So rovers like, oh yeah, now
that's not an 80 full, that's a,

1466
01:29:50,011 --> 01:29:54,420
that's a 2002 well the repeated the Vin,

1467
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,510
the last six digits cut
repeated through the decades.

1468
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:01,950
So a lot of these cars were
stolen and not stolen, seized.

1469
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:05,460
And in some cases erroneously
scrapped whether they want illegal.

1470
01:30:06,450 --> 01:30:09,010
So I don't know.
The ones that I built,

1471
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:12,630
I'll only use a u s model cause I don't
want anything to do with that shit show.

1472
01:30:12,631 --> 01:30:14,610
But I have to have much important,

1473
01:30:14,611 --> 01:30:19,611
we're actually importing a 1946
[inaudible] from France this week.

1474
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:23,150
What does a Simcoe, it's, it's uh,

1475
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:28,050
wealthsimple Sitka I believe was owned
by Ford and they built all sorts of stuff

1476
01:30:28,051 --> 01:30:30,390
under license.
The car that we're going to do as this,

1477
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:35,810
it's like a funky two door woody version
of the Fiat top Alina that was licensed

1478
01:30:36,691 --> 01:30:41,040
to the French market to be made by
Sim. So, but that thing's so old.

1479
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:45,130
It will be easy to import. This video
just totally gives me a boner. Well,

1480
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:49,170
what you've done is create
like the perfect defender
but you don't want to do it

1481
01:30:49,171 --> 01:30:52,860
again. I mean this means he doing
but it still wasn't perfect,

1482
01:30:52,861 --> 01:30:57,780
which is what bugged me. But it
has a design game. Beautiful Look,

1483
01:30:58,110 --> 01:31:00,100
pray,
but it's not,

1484
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:05,300
it's like it's got this manly
utility that's a lot to it.

1485
01:31:05,371 --> 01:31:06,204
It's just,

1486
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:09,510
it just makes you want to own it and it
makes you want to drive around in it and

1487
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:12,510
deal with all of its quirks.
It's so that means some,

1488
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:17,580
it's the shapes that just become so
satisfying for whatever reason. Nailed it.

1489
01:31:17,581 --> 01:31:21,690
The shape on them is just
magic. Everything. The, the
bulge that the hood has,

1490
01:31:21,691 --> 01:31:25,140
the fender flares. I like how you
have in a different color, like a,

1491
01:31:25,141 --> 01:31:29,410
I like how you repurpose the events
and you know, redesign the site.

1492
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:34,490
Actually work because they didn't
do anything before a whole. Yeah.

1493
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:38,170
And there are plastic and you use
twisted parts too. Right? Okay.

1494
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:42,360
They get some good work to quality. But
which she did, man, this is amazing.

1495
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:46,230
He fucking, you need to do this more. You
do, I'm sorry. You need to make these,

1496
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:50,430
this would be as big of a seller
as those Goddamn Broncos. Yeah.

1497
01:31:50,431 --> 01:31:51,870
But I can't get the bodies.

1498
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,180
And the other issue is the way
the bodies are built there,

1499
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:57,090
their angle iron with
aluminum riveted to it.

1500
01:31:57,690 --> 01:32:01,030
So like boat builders of known not
to do that since World War One.

1501
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,840
So the rest themselves from the inside
out. There's nothing I can do about it,

1502
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:08,850
but can't that be done again, like
the way you do your FJ forties. Um,

1503
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:11,050
so let me explain this to folks.
When I got there,

1504
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:16,230
you have this FJ 40 which is this a Toyota
jeep like vehicle from the 1960s and

1505
01:32:17,831 --> 01:32:22,090
seventies. And what you've
done is, oh actually they
went deep into the 80s right.

1506
01:32:22,091 --> 01:32:24,470
With that shame early eighties the,

1507
01:32:24,471 --> 01:32:27,880
that you've made a
completely new version of it.

1508
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:32,860
So it is sort of an FJ 40 but there's
nothing that's really from an Fj 40 you've

1509
01:32:32,861 --> 01:32:37,861
just got the shape that you've completely
had remanufacturer in a in a beautiful

1510
01:32:38,141 --> 01:32:39,550
new aluminum.

1511
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:44,630
So we keep sort of core components so
that we can still justify an illegal front

1512
01:32:46,081 --> 01:32:50,630
that it is a resto mod but it
has with color resto mod fuck it.

1513
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:54,780
Structural portion of the
firewall, bib, hinge, headlight,

1514
01:32:54,781 --> 01:32:59,040
Bezel, pedal back a couple
of things. It's a joke.

1515
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:03,030
That's why we're hoping to get this law
passed cause cause then you don't need

1516
01:33:03,031 --> 01:33:05,630
the old car. We can purpose build
it. This is so fucking pray.

1517
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:11,430
The fjs traditionally had rust issues
so we crafted out of 60 61 aluminum.

1518
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:18,990
But the way that body shape we can get
away with pretty crude construction

1519
01:33:18,991 --> 01:33:21,300
techniques with the rover,

1520
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:26,220
there's things about it that you couldn't
so you could reinterpret it and then

1521
01:33:26,221 --> 01:33:30,690
you're probably up legal creek with Land
Rover that you'd have to negotiate and

1522
01:33:30,691 --> 01:33:34,170
come to terms with.
The other issue is even the tooling,

1523
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:36,440
as primitive as it might be for the Fj,

1524
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:38,910
if I was the only geek using those bodies,

1525
01:33:38,911 --> 01:33:42,480
I could have never made a business model
for the amortization of the development

1526
01:33:42,481 --> 01:33:47,481
cost of the tools needed to make it so
other companies that run the company that

1527
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:49,980
makes, it's called
rubbish. They're in Canada,

1528
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:55,550
they have a fairly significant market
of which I'm probably a minority too,

1529
01:33:55,651 --> 01:33:58,050
which guys buy them and
build their own thing or

1530
01:33:58,450 --> 01:34:01,020
this thing is so incredible,
which, and looking at the video,

1531
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,460
this defender one 10 with
the internal sub frame,

1532
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:09,230
you're into the edit j video now. Oh, this
afternoon. Okay. Is this the Fj 44 yup.

1533
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:13,370
Okay, so this is a four door, four door
version, which didn't really exist. Right?

1534
01:34:13,371 --> 01:34:15,260
This is also something
that you've created. Yeah.

1535
01:34:15,261 --> 01:34:17,150
It just never made sense
to us that it didn't,

1536
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:21,110
back in those days when Toyota did do a
four door wagon version, Land Cruiser,

1537
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:26,090
the body style had nothing to do with
the 40 I always thought the 40 would be

1538
01:34:26,091 --> 01:34:30,200
cool as a four door and actually
there's a 40 that's a two data.

1539
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:31,910
A client on the phone,

1540
01:34:31,911 --> 01:34:36,020
it was ready to rock and his wife suffers
shoulder saying you can't have it.

1541
01:34:36,021 --> 01:34:38,930
If you can't take the kids with you
on the weekend, you ain't getting it.

1542
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,980
So this is when we were a little bit
hungrier earlier on with the brand.

1543
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:47,510
I did a quick and dirty like South Park
Quality Photoshop rendering turn one

1544
01:34:47,511 --> 01:34:51,890
into a four door, punted it to him and
she's like, you can get one of those.

1545
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:55,220
So I'm like, all right. So I winged
it on what the costs were going to be.

1546
01:34:55,460 --> 01:35:00,380
Lost some money on it, but it took that
design and made it our next new model.

1547
01:35:00,381 --> 01:35:04,010
And then now it's, it's, it's our
most popular cause six passengers.

1548
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:07,940
If this law passes and you can sort
of just build your own vehicles,

1549
01:35:07,941 --> 01:35:12,750
do you anticipate ever just
building something completely
from scratch? Yes. Yeah.

1550
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:13,071
I mean,

1551
01:35:13,071 --> 01:35:18,071
part of me is challenging myself
because like I mentioned earlier,

1552
01:35:18,531 --> 01:35:23,531
a big part of why what I do now is
appealing to people is that people already

1553
01:35:24,381 --> 01:35:28,010
have history and story and
emotions tied to these vehicles.

1554
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:32,750
But I have other stupid ideas that are
like based on theoreticals of like if the

1555
01:35:32,751 --> 01:35:37,190
industrial revolution hadn't happened
when it happened and streamlined art

1556
01:35:37,191 --> 01:35:41,210
moderne continued to prosper
and develop as a design style,

1557
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:46,310
where, what would that final ultimate
vision be? I want to build that car,

1558
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:50,060
but much harder to market it
because no one has an affinity.

1559
01:35:50,061 --> 01:35:54,650
It's called the Helio's, um, based
on the creek God of the wind.

1560
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:58,040
And it's, I would design it to
fit on the new test, the platform.

1561
01:35:58,041 --> 01:36:01,880
And it's like if Howard
Hughes drank too many,

1562
01:36:01,881 --> 01:36:03,140
he didn't drink apparently,

1563
01:36:03,141 --> 01:36:07,100
but if he got drunk with Buck Minister
fueler and Gordon pure record,

1564
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:11,030
two great designers, what would that
Napkin sketch of look like? It's like,

1565
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:16,031
what would he have taken Corella Deville
to the country club in big gnarly

1566
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:20,660
aircraft and the spired burnished
aluminum leather straps,

1567
01:36:20,661 --> 01:36:21,860
a little bit of steam punk,

1568
01:36:21,861 --> 01:36:26,861
a little bit of aerospace hot Rod
Tesla audacious thing to build it.

1569
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:34,640
That sounds awesome. Yeah, I'm, I'm
in. I like it. I love it. These, these,

1570
01:36:34,641 --> 01:36:36,100
these designs,
you know,

1571
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:40,610
I think a big part of what you're saying
is definitely true that people have

1572
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:43,700
this connection to these particular
shapes that they fell in love with,

1573
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:46,220
like the Fj 40 like the Bronco.

1574
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:50,990
But I think that your company
also is developing that on
its own. You're, you're,

1575
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:55,270
you're developing your own sort of
following. Thank you. Yeah, so I set out,

1576
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:59,120
I think you're right. I think long
term that's better. Like right now,

1577
01:36:59,121 --> 01:37:01,520
if I did a vehicle holy of our own design,

1578
01:37:01,521 --> 01:37:05,810
the titling process follows that of
like a kit car, which is not scalable.

1579
01:37:06,290 --> 01:37:11,090
So if, if that law evolves, I'm, I'm
all in. I got tons of stupid ideas.

1580
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:15,950
Yeah, that's a weird thing. Right? Like
the, the kit car thing, that's like,

1581
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:20,840
they would sell a lot of those like the
uh, the noble, the noble, which I sell.

1582
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:22,670
What does that mean? It's
an English car, right? Yeah.

1583
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:27,110
And then they just get the body and you
have to buy a roller and then you have

1584
01:37:27,111 --> 01:37:28,940
to have another duty to
put the drive training.

1585
01:37:29,330 --> 01:37:32,210
Or what's crazier is still is
the way the laws are currently,

1586
01:37:32,211 --> 01:37:35,660
and this bill we're trying to get past
is literally just the combination of

1587
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:38,570
existing laws saying, look,
this is all out there,

1588
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,460
but right now companies can't do it.

1589
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:45,730
So if some dude in his backyard has some
spare two by fours and some corrugated

1590
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:50,210
sheeting and a VA,
he can hack together a death trap,

1591
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:54,440
take it down. If it has turn signals, tail
lights and basic stuff, he's good to go.

1592
01:37:54,990 --> 01:37:59,640
If a company were to build that
same assemblage, it's not legal.

1593
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:03,780
So it's just asinine because the
companies are going to have the technical

1594
01:38:03,781 --> 01:38:07,950
resources, the financial wherewithal,
the accountability, et Cetera,

1595
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:12,360
to create a safer, better, more conscious
product. So it makes no sense to me.

1596
01:38:12,361 --> 01:38:16,050
That's why we're hoping it will make
sense to Congress because we know how good

1597
01:38:16,051 --> 01:38:18,900
they are efficiently
reviewing and passing things.

1598
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:21,330
That'll further our nation's interest.
At least on paper.

1599
01:38:21,331 --> 01:38:22,950
The companies have
enough money to do that.

1600
01:38:22,951 --> 01:38:27,450
There's the the leap right from the
initial investment to putting together an

1601
01:38:27,451 --> 01:38:31,710
actual car, but it's so much cheaper now.
What do you got there? That's the Helios.

1602
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:32,310
Oh,

1603
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:36,960
it's gotten so much more cost
effective and viable to bring out.

1604
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:41,850
Highly engineered, no compromise.
High quality, low volume product.

1605
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,040
Is this anywhere online
where Jamie can pull this up?

1606
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:45,540
This is one of the coolest
things I've ever seen.

1607
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:50,190
Send send this to Jane where which,
where's the Google icon? Helio's, H, e l.

1608
01:38:50,191 --> 01:38:53,490
I. O. S and it'll pop right up. This
is sick. You'd sell a million of these,

1609
01:38:53,491 --> 01:38:56,370
five of the things. You're going to build
that thing and we tried to suicides,

1610
01:38:56,390 --> 01:39:00,090
attention. His engineering team
drafted a letter and send it to me.

1611
01:39:00,091 --> 01:39:04,470
He was so sweet. That title was
like peanut butter for chocolate,

1612
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:09,060
begging Ilan to support this.
Not on a branded level,

1613
01:39:09,061 --> 01:39:12,690
but give us a meal.
Tesla and the technological,

1614
01:39:12,691 --> 01:39:17,691
the the engineering support to repurpose
the Tesla in this unique platform.

1615
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:22,290
But we never got his attention.
Somebody needs to get ahold of him please.

1616
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:23,280
I don't,
I'm not saying Twitter,

1617
01:39:23,281 --> 01:39:28,281
Bama but Twitter but I'm just ready
for whoever wants to support it at this

1618
01:39:28,381 --> 01:39:30,600
point. I'll do it. Electric gas or diesel.

1619
01:39:30,601 --> 01:39:34,350
I just need to see it fucking built
cause it's just keeps me awake.

1620
01:39:34,351 --> 01:39:37,070
That's so beautiful. And
the, again the suicided,

1621
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:43,040
that's Howard's original experimental
planes stunt plane that he built his topic

1622
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:46,320
age. Wine too. I like the
original version of the things.

1623
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:50,280
That's a series of panels
showing inspirations that
we start with a fuselage of

1624
01:39:50,281 --> 01:39:53,640
the plane.
Then we roll it into road going form.

1625
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:58,140
Then we start to do the packaging
factors and the kid kept evolving.

1626
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:01,810
Wow. God this is fucking
crazy. Deal panels,

1627
01:40:01,811 --> 01:40:05,370
Sun roofs that are on cranks with
exposed gear and leather ratchet.

1628
01:40:05,371 --> 01:40:10,371
So there's like that somewhat steam
punk interface of the mechanical power

1629
01:40:10,621 --> 01:40:13,000
windows seem deal. I want
like brass cure. See,

1630
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:16,350
see the gears rotate as well as Dale.
I love it.

1631
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:21,380
I love the little leather covered dash
to the hand stitched dash and the rivets.

1632
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:24,920
If I had the cash, this thing would
already be under construct. Fuck,

1633
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,750
I just built it for myself.
But you know all these rich dudes,

1634
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:30,750
it seems like someone would have
already dove into this. Totally.

1635
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:34,890
This is a no lose. This is gorgeous,
but it's expensive. Oh yeah.

1636
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:36,210
Well no profit.

1637
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:41,930
This thing would still cost me probably
1.31 point 4 million just to deny it

1638
01:40:42,661 --> 01:40:44,280
first right now like yeah,

1639
01:40:44,281 --> 01:40:48,630
I could make it look good and everything
but like engineered finite analyze like

1640
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:49,740
balls out done.

1641
01:40:49,741 --> 01:40:54,280
It'd be at least 1.1 call you Texas friend
that wanted a chainsaw. That Ferrari

1642
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:57,970
in half. Let's see. He only likes Ferraris
because everybody knows what a frog.

1643
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:00,580
So that's another promise.
Some dudes look at this and go yet,

1644
01:41:00,581 --> 01:41:04,180
but it's not the Bentley.
So those people need to eat dick.

1645
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:06,910
They really do all of them.

1646
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:12,280
Why are you being like that all at least
in and my friend, money's no option.

1647
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:15,460
Exclusivity.
I had recently in Encino,

1648
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:20,790
I was driving one of our things and this
like stereotypical Armenian guy with,

1649
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:26,590
you know, the big gold and the loafers
and the whole night. Nice. He leans over,

1650
01:41:26,850 --> 01:41:30,580
he looks in peaks in the
window. It goes props, but all,

1651
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:35,050
I thought that was killer. It
was really cool. Armenians, man,

1652
01:41:35,051 --> 01:41:36,940
I love how they just
wear it on their sleeve.

1653
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:39,580
There's one of my favorite people
and they're like, don't fuck with me.

1654
01:41:39,581 --> 01:41:41,950
I am what I am and I'm
going to protect the baby.

1655
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:46,340
They're not trying to change at all.
Gold chains. Fucking flying high go baby.

1656
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:50,820
Yeah. This is a beautiful thing,
man, to creating things like this is,

1657
01:41:50,821 --> 01:41:54,670
this is beautiful. I love
it. It's a dream. I'm stoked.
I'm glad you're doing it.

1658
01:41:54,671 --> 01:41:56,200
I just think it's so important.

1659
01:41:56,201 --> 01:42:01,090
It's so important that someone out there
is creating these bizarre creations,

1660
01:42:01,091 --> 01:42:04,120
these, these even more important,
someone's buying them. Yes,

1661
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:07,780
but they're gonna be doing it. But I'd
be doing it in my garage at my house.

1662
01:42:07,781 --> 01:42:10,840
And just kind of wanting to tell.
And the fact that you put out,

1663
01:42:10,841 --> 01:42:14,050
like we said early, you put out all these
videos and you put all these, these,

1664
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:17,950
these images, even if people aren't,
they don't have the cash to buy him.

1665
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:22,900
People get inspired. But what you're
doing, oh fucking for sure. 100%.

1666
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:26,880
Tell me how much is it like a
defender to reengineer? Cause I,

1667
01:42:26,930 --> 01:42:30,460
your video is very extensive.
Like you had to reengineer price.

1668
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:34,090
How much is something like
that cost? Ah, the defenders,

1669
01:42:34,091 --> 01:42:37,130
the d 90 and the one time
we've done two so far, uh,

1670
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:41,270
anywhere from 250 to low,
400,000.

1671
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:47,200
And that's a car angel.
And I have to tell somebody that,

1672
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:51,490
but these people that you are building
these nuts, they're just crazy.

1673
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:55,860
And they go, well yeah I've tried it this
way. I one built by and, but these all,

1674
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:59,080
they suck. I get what you do. Just do it.

1675
01:42:59,530 --> 01:43:02,620
So most people who would do a Matthew
Perlman's, great guy, he's a guy,

1676
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:06,310
does west coast defenders, met them,
hung out with them and seen his shop.

1677
01:43:06,311 --> 01:43:11,170
What he's doing is rebuilding
them. Exactly. But brand
new, smarter than me. But,

1678
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:15,190
but what you're doing,
you're reengineering everything.

1679
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:18,310
Is there anybody out there re he
reengineering everything, the suspension,

1680
01:43:18,311 --> 01:43:20,500
the subframe, the, the way the,

1681
01:43:20,501 --> 01:43:25,501
the floor is sealed and polyuria coded
and you're just tying it to a stupid

1682
01:43:26,111 --> 01:43:28,750
level. Um, I guess singer,

1683
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:33,740
singer and then arch motorcycles.
Mm.

1684
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:34,720
Um,

1685
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:39,720
those guys I'd say are on par with
rethinking every little nuance and going

1686
01:43:41,741 --> 01:43:45,430
balls out on it. If you ever heard, have
you met those guys down in Long Beach?

1687
01:43:45,431 --> 01:43:49,960
And it's a Keanu Reeves
and um, um, ah, man,

1688
01:43:49,961 --> 01:43:52,160
I can't remember his name.
He's a sweetheart, um,

1689
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:57,230
guard, guard, guard and Kiana, his
company. And they're doing a lovely,

1690
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,650
lovely, lovely job. Now
it's to a guy like you,

1691
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:05,480
Google auto drive cars have to be the
devil. Yes. That's the devil. It is.

1692
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,710
What's going to happen?

1693
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:09,530
Are we gonna we're gonna not be able
to drive our own cars in the future.

1694
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:11,030
Is that a possibility?
You know,

1695
01:44:11,031 --> 01:44:14,870
I've been thinking long and hard about
that and it's been something that um,

1696
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:20,470
different people in my sub culture have
openly been concerned and discussing and

1697
01:44:21,711 --> 01:44:25,430
there's many different takes on it,
but I think I'm pretty centered on it.

1698
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:30,290
I think actually it's a positive thing
and that cars is like the Prius and

1699
01:44:30,291 --> 01:44:31,280
stuff,
you know,

1700
01:44:31,281 --> 01:44:35,480
started the generation where people
don't have an emotional relationship with

1701
01:44:35,481 --> 01:44:38,990
their vehicle. It's a tool. It's
literally like an APP on your phone.

1702
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:43,400
It gets you from a to B or even
more dispassionately. Screw it.

1703
01:44:43,401 --> 01:44:46,910
You Uber around and you don't care.
You don't have that relationship.

1704
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:51,830
So I think culturally as autonomous
vehicles and all that continue to grow and

1705
01:44:51,831 --> 01:44:54,770
evolve, you are going to see them
eventually become predominant.

1706
01:44:55,130 --> 01:45:00,130
And I think we're going to start to see
lobbying and federal support of that

1707
01:45:00,471 --> 01:45:04,970
direction because there's
a lot of rational reasons
behind it. That being said,

1708
01:45:04,971 --> 01:45:09,440
I think it will further strengthen the
demand for the freaks and the Geeks,

1709
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:15,220
the outliers such as my brand because
people are going to yearn for that

1710
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:20,210
relationship, that attachment, and I
think there's always going to be people.

1711
01:45:20,211 --> 01:45:24,010
Even the guy who's got the autonomous
Mercedes at that says commuter,

1712
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:26,220
but on the it's like, oh no,
I mean this thing's got to,

1713
01:45:26,490 --> 01:45:30,470
it's caught a manual transmission
and there's, there's,
there's pedals by the way,

1714
01:45:30,471 --> 01:45:33,800
and there's three of those pedals and
you have to push that one down to get it

1715
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:35,330
to, you know, I think there,

1716
01:45:35,331 --> 01:45:40,331
there's that visceral relationship that
is always going to be part of mankind

1717
01:45:42,110 --> 01:45:45,920
and I'm not worried about it. If I
was trying to start a big car company,

1718
01:45:45,921 --> 01:45:47,150
then I would be worried about it.

1719
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:51,590
American muscle cars are one of the
only companies that are sticking to that

1720
01:45:51,591 --> 01:45:53,780
manual transmission model.

1721
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:58,980
I mean some cars like the z 28 and
the like up until this version of the

1722
01:45:59,511 --> 01:46:00,200
corvette,

1723
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:03,980
you couldn't get the high end corvette
and anything but a manual like the Zr one

1724
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:08,150
admissions laws are screwing that pooch
because it's so much harder for them to

1725
01:46:08,151 --> 01:46:11,630
certify a manual car than an
automatic cause. The automatic,

1726
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:16,640
the shifts cycles and efficiencies are
much easier to track and to regulate and

1727
01:46:16,641 --> 01:46:20,890
pretense for in the programming
and engineering dynamics
of the car. So that's,

1728
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:25,580
it's an emissions issue more
than anything. Also nowadays,

1729
01:46:25,581 --> 01:46:28,650
the odd today's automatics are
quicker than of course, man.

1730
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:32,550
Well that's the Porsche deal. I mean
the, the version of what that car public,

1731
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:33,650
sure.
As to why,

1732
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:38,980
but the real answer is based on emissions
and efficiency as far as gas and fuel

1733
01:46:39,561 --> 01:46:44,561
consumption control over efficiency
more than honest efficiency because you

1734
01:46:45,501 --> 01:46:48,530
manual driven, right?
You can make it work.

1735
01:46:48,531 --> 01:46:50,640
I mean the CVT train constant velocity.

1736
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:53,760
Everyone said how amazing they were
going to be for efficiency and there's,

1737
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:57,030
you know, they work with the snowy
tears. Yeah, it's an automatic,

1738
01:46:57,031 --> 01:47:00,900
but it's like if you picture a cone form,
it's spins out.

1739
01:47:00,901 --> 01:47:04,410
So the ratio is constantly changing
as you go through your speed cycles,

1740
01:47:04,411 --> 01:47:08,640
but seemed like a great idea, but at
the end of the day and true world use,

1741
01:47:08,641 --> 01:47:11,130
they realize, oh yeah, no,

1742
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:15,180
it was incredibly inefficient
just to spoil the fucker.

1743
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:18,600
You were deficit of 10%
and your fuel economy.

1744
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:20,890
So I think it'll,

1745
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:24,540
it'll hopefully shift back and like how
many more gears can they shoved in our

1746
01:47:24,541 --> 01:47:27,180
automatic to try and meet
emissions as well. Yeah,

1747
01:47:27,181 --> 01:47:32,130
they're going to eight now and they're
doing seven, seven with manuals now too,

1748
01:47:32,131 --> 01:47:36,480
which is weird. Pain in the ass. It's
just, it's an awkward pattern, but again,

1749
01:47:36,481 --> 01:47:39,960
it's a business case, right? It's
a hell of a lot easier to add.

1750
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:44,190
Shove a couple more gears to keep that
motor in it tighter, more controlled,

1751
01:47:44,191 --> 01:47:49,191
more predictable rpm band than it is
to evolve and keep engineering internal

1752
01:47:49,291 --> 01:47:53,870
combustion.
Make it better for all of your motor runs.

1753
01:47:53,871 --> 01:47:58,200
So hesitant to do that until it's
regulated or competition forces that

1754
01:47:58,201 --> 01:47:59,520
transition.
It's just,

1755
01:47:59,521 --> 01:48:03,660
to me it's a bummer that a lot of these
sports cars at the very least are going

1756
01:48:03,661 --> 01:48:08,661
by Norberg ring times and there they want
zero to 60 times and not how they make

1757
01:48:09,151 --> 01:48:11,700
you feel. Yeah, but that's what
a sports car, it's always been.

1758
01:48:11,701 --> 01:48:15,380
Most of the Times driving, you're not,
you're not counting laps when you're a,

1759
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:19,440
you're on little by little to hunger.
Rather, you're not looking for laptops.

1760
01:48:19,441 --> 01:48:23,220
You're looking for pure enjoyment
and if you're shifting the gears,

1761
01:48:23,221 --> 01:48:26,010
you're going to get more enjoyment because
you're going to be more connected to

1762
01:48:26,011 --> 01:48:28,920
the experience. Totally.
But, and more than that too,

1763
01:48:28,921 --> 01:48:33,921
like drove a 97 nine nine three 12 turbo
to a friend's House to drive his new

1764
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:41,250
50th anniversary,
nine 11 sexy car bitch and colors,

1765
01:48:41,251 --> 01:48:45,480
beautiful tactile surfaces.
Cool tweet. You tried it.

1766
01:48:46,830 --> 01:48:48,180
It doesn't feel like a Porsche to me.

1767
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:52,320
There's so many distractions and knobs
and widgets and Gizmos and switches and

1768
01:48:52,321 --> 01:48:56,800
alarms and babysitters and lawyers on
board versus that nine, nine, three yet.

1769
01:48:56,801 --> 01:48:58,980
It's radically, yeah. Can
shake your teeth. Yes.

1770
01:48:58,981 --> 01:49:03,540
It can blow your eardrums out when you
drunk Indian nail it, whatever it is,

1771
01:49:03,541 --> 01:49:08,100
what it is. It had purity of
purpose and I think many brands,

1772
01:49:08,101 --> 01:49:13,020
but most notably automotive brands have
fallen prey to focus groups where they

1773
01:49:13,021 --> 01:49:18,021
try and create a product that appeals
to this mythical large demographic of

1774
01:49:18,901 --> 01:49:23,740
everyone's going to love it, which in
turn I think they step on there we we,

1775
01:49:23,741 --> 01:49:27,060
because it doesn't speak to any one,

1776
01:49:27,830 --> 01:49:32,160
it doesn't have clarity,
purpose in its engineering and design.

1777
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:34,770
It doesn't have the balls to say,
I'm not for everyone.

1778
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:37,860
This is what I do and I do it damn well.
Not only that,

1779
01:49:37,861 --> 01:49:41,490
it doesn't appeal to automotive
enthusiasts. It appeals to people.

1780
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:46,190
That might not be the same thing. The you
could say the same thing about sitcoms.

1781
01:49:46,191 --> 01:49:47,800
You could say the same thing.
Movies.

1782
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,440
When someone creates
something odd and unique,

1783
01:49:50,441 --> 01:49:52,870
it's very difficult for
other people to agree to it.

1784
01:49:52,871 --> 01:49:56,440
If they give it to a focus group or a
heart for the poor bastard producer,

1785
01:49:56,441 --> 01:50:00,370
writer it actually sell it
because everyone wants to
dumb it down to the largest

1786
01:50:00,371 --> 01:50:04,330
common denominator, the formula
they were able to sell to the ads.

1787
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:09,580
You know the advertisers last season
or what that company's doing a whatever

1788
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:15,880
catwalk show. Well let's do a dog
walk, whatever it is and yeah,

1789
01:50:16,330 --> 01:50:20,770
well isn't that the case Wa or one of
the best examples for why a business like

1790
01:50:20,771 --> 01:50:25,170
yours works is it's you and your wife.
I mean it's you, it's you and your,

1791
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:30,510
and I think that singular vision is
consumers are ganging up to demand that

1792
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:32,920
thank goodness,
but I mean you tick,

1793
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:37,060
I've always said you take like
every modern four door sedan,

1794
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:41,230
car paying all of them black,
take all the fucking emblems off,

1795
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:44,200
put them on a big empty airplane hangar,

1796
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:48,820
bringing it thousand of the general
public car geeks and not ask them to name

1797
01:50:48,821 --> 01:50:51,850
all these cars. Well who makes them,
which brand they are. But you know,

1798
01:50:51,851 --> 01:50:56,800
one would get better than a d plus
because they're all copying each other and

1799
01:50:56,801 --> 01:51:01,270
all trying to not be too out land issue.
Too unique or too different.

1800
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:04,420
All they're doing is making their
blink bigger. The grills bigger,

1801
01:51:04,421 --> 01:51:09,310
the emblem larger, and it's like
there's a loss of, of, of, uh,

1802
01:51:09,311 --> 01:51:10,600
of individualism.
Well,

1803
01:51:10,601 --> 01:51:15,250
there's only a few that you
could recognize based on
sort of the iconic grills

1804
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:19,510
like BMWs. They have those too. Like
jeeps, you can kind of recognize those.

1805
01:51:19,511 --> 01:51:22,990
But boy, there's a Hyundai that looks
just like a fucking Mercedes now. I mean,

1806
01:51:23,170 --> 01:51:26,260
I've seen it many times.
I thought it was a Mercedes and it's hard.

1807
01:51:26,261 --> 01:51:29,320
It's that look like Aston Martins
and on and on. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1808
01:51:29,321 --> 01:51:32,380
There's a lot of that going on right
now. There's a lot of like, boy,

1809
01:51:32,381 --> 01:51:36,560
if this was the music business,
you might get fucking sued. You're,

1810
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:40,000
you're stealing notes.
Right? Totally. Do you,

1811
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:43,300
is there anything that excites you
about modern automobiles that they're

1812
01:51:43,301 --> 01:51:46,540
creating now? Is there anything
that you find that it is a positive?

1813
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:47,291
You had a lot of them.

1814
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:52,291
Mechanical engineering is mindblowing
electromagnetic suspension system.

1815
01:51:52,841 --> 01:51:57,841
I'm finding quite interesting
and hoping to start dabbling in.

1816
01:51:57,851 --> 01:51:59,230
Yeah, constantly. What did,

1817
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:03,610
I just think a lot of it's superfluous
and promoting self obsolescence.

1818
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:06,970
So I'm like always cautious, but
I mean, I'm not immune to it.

1819
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,930
So like I'll lease a crazy
new car once in a while,

1820
01:52:10,931 --> 01:52:13,800
but I'll do a one year or
two year leash and I'll,

1821
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:17,980
I'll put it in its place like
it's so complex. It's Asinine.

1822
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:20,980
It's going to fall apart. But
right now is really fun, you know?

1823
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:25,240
But usually like within six months I'm
bored because it has no soul and then I

1824
01:52:26,110 --> 01:52:30,340
lose my ass and move on. Well, we'll
hop back in my desoto what I, yeah,

1825
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:34,750
well there's a total difference in the
what? That you're aware you're doing it.

1826
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:39,070
Whereas like the Lexus,
I love my big Lexus truck because it's,

1827
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:43,750
Oh yeah, it's floats over
everything and it's just bone quiet.

1828
01:52:43,751 --> 01:52:45,740
It's just woo smooth.

1829
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:49,550
But you're not experiencing
it the way you experience,

1830
01:52:49,551 --> 01:52:54,050
say like one of your fjs or
something like that. So, I mean,

1831
01:52:54,051 --> 01:52:58,430
I've got a lot of clients who maybe
daily they're going to hop in that Lx for

1832
01:52:58,431 --> 01:52:59,360
the boring commute,

1833
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:04,280
but then when they really want to engage
or with the themselves, the vehicle,

1834
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:07,250
the family of the hobby,
the locale,

1835
01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:09,860
then they're going to hop in the
icon and they're going to be,

1836
01:53:10,010 --> 01:53:11,450
it's more of an experience.

1837
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:14,000
One of the things that I like about you
and what you're doing with your company

1838
01:53:14,001 --> 01:53:15,020
is you as a person,

1839
01:53:15,021 --> 01:53:19,970
you have this broad variety of interests
and respects for cultures and various

1840
01:53:19,971 --> 01:53:22,790
things, and I noticed the from
following your Instagram, but you,

1841
01:53:22,791 --> 01:53:26,630
you do a lot of trips and he'd take a
lot of trips to these different cultures.

1842
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:29,570
Are you doing this because this
is something you personally enjoy?

1843
01:53:29,571 --> 01:53:32,690
Are you like consciously trying
to enrich yourself like, yeah,

1844
01:53:32,691 --> 01:53:35,810
it's always been priority number
one. I think as a, as Americans,

1845
01:53:35,811 --> 01:53:40,811
we have a bad habit of having blinders
on and not understanding there's the shit

1846
01:53:41,391 --> 01:53:46,391
that we get all es or panties in a
knot about mean absolutely nothing.

1847
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:48,800
On the opposite side of the coin.

1848
01:53:48,801 --> 01:53:53,390
I think progress is a
misrepresented benefit to mankind.

1849
01:53:53,391 --> 01:53:57,860
I've been to some remote cultures where
I think those people are a hell of a lot

1850
01:53:57,861 --> 01:54:02,840
more balanced and centered and
family focused and healthy.

1851
01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:08,020
Um, then we are in our
progress. So I liked,

1852
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:12,470
I love traveling. It's super
important to me. And as a designer,

1853
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,710
um,
understanding different cultures,

1854
01:54:15,711 --> 01:54:20,711
approaches to solutions complex or
simple or use of color and texture and

1855
01:54:20,901 --> 01:54:25,520
materials. It just enriches
what I do to, to no end.

1856
01:54:25,521 --> 01:54:29,710
But I think it's, it's really a much
bigger picture life thing. Like, um,

1857
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:32,420
it's gotten more expensive
now I have two teenage signs,

1858
01:54:32,421 --> 01:54:35,560
but like we'll travel less but we'll,

1859
01:54:35,561 --> 01:54:40,220
we'll still make sure that to do those
trips and bring the kids at least half

1860
01:54:40,221 --> 01:54:44,570
the time. So you know, we, they
have that, that perspective.

1861
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:48,410
Yeah. Then the enrichment is sort
of, it's not like calculable,

1862
01:54:48,411 --> 01:54:50,150
you can't like put it
on a scale. Like, Hey,

1863
01:54:50,151 --> 01:54:52,280
we should go to Africa
because it's worth this.

1864
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,520
It just changes the way you
see the world and how you,

1865
01:54:56,570 --> 01:54:58,400
when you make eye contact with someone,

1866
01:54:58,730 --> 01:55:02,510
what you're expecting out of that person
or what's your open to experiencing

1867
01:55:02,511 --> 01:55:03,410
from that person.

1868
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:09,100
I think travelers open themselves up to
such a crazy greater level to be able to

1869
01:55:11,510 --> 01:55:16,190
embrace and experience and you just
never know what's going to happen.

1870
01:55:16,191 --> 01:55:21,191
And what one trip or handshake or
eye contact will turn into them.

1871
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:25,430
I'm on the board of this kickass
charity called go campaign.

1872
01:55:25,431 --> 01:55:29,030
You should come one year. We do a really
fun cars and casino night at the shop.

1873
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:33,570
When do you do it? Joel Mchale
was our host this year. We
do it the first weekend.

1874
01:55:33,650 --> 01:55:36,860
Amaze us. We love him to one
of my favorite humans. Um,

1875
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:41,990
so you know we were in,
in Africa a couple of weeks ago and yeah,

1876
01:55:41,991 --> 01:55:44,790
we were doing the safari
camping glamping thing,

1877
01:55:44,791 --> 01:55:47,690
but we were in Tanzania because we're,

1878
01:55:47,691 --> 01:55:50,870
we're starting a big fundraiser
this year with go, um,

1879
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,740
to create a new center like
children's center. Cause, um,

1880
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:59,640
if you have physical or
mental disabilities in many
African cultures, it's,

1881
01:55:59,641 --> 01:56:02,770
it's frightening what
happens. So there's, um,

1882
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:08,390
there's ways to impact the
world outside of buildings,

1883
01:56:08,391 --> 01:56:13,080
silly cars for rich guys. But
both experiences, you know,

1884
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:18,270
doing something for a children's
center, Tanzania, those relationships,

1885
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:21,810
those experiences all helped
me gain a different and better,

1886
01:56:22,290 --> 01:56:26,310
hopefully more valuable perspective on
everything down to how I'm going to build

1887
01:56:26,311 --> 01:56:27,900
a car or what material we're going to use.

1888
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:32,040
So I think what we were talking about
earlier about teaching inspiration in

1889
01:56:32,041 --> 01:56:35,550
school and you know, teaching people
how to think and how to fall passion,

1890
01:56:35,551 --> 01:56:37,020
that it's a lacking component.

1891
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:39,870
I think you could also say these sort
of the same thing about traveling and

1892
01:56:39,871 --> 01:56:43,800
experiencing different cultures
exchange program. It's not richer.

1893
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:47,200
It's not as appreciated.
Or as, as, as um, uh,

1894
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:52,860
what's the word? Um, it's not as
encouraged, you know, it's what it is.

1895
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:57,750
Well and sadly enough to, unfortunately
nowadays a lot of your global travels,

1896
01:56:57,751 --> 01:57:02,751
you might as well be at the third street
promenade in Santa Monica or Paris or

1897
01:57:03,061 --> 01:57:08,061
Barcelona or wherever because this big
box commoditize the tourist experience

1898
01:57:09,181 --> 01:57:14,181
has become this kind of homologated
experience that's one size fit on you.

1899
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:20,940
It's the gap or whatever. It's the same
box stores and think more and more.

1900
01:57:20,941 --> 01:57:25,530
It's like Disneyland travel unless
you really work hard at it to find the

1901
01:57:25,531 --> 01:57:28,110
culture in the people, so
that's kind of scary. Yeah,

1902
01:57:28,111 --> 01:57:32,460
you got to really go looking
for it. I found all of
garden, the Sao Paulo airport,

1903
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:36,770
so they go, sorry, olive garden,

1904
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:39,180
but you see like what Detroit
is doing in the airport.

1905
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:41,460
They did a great example of this hopeful,

1906
01:57:41,461 --> 01:57:46,461
this renaissance I speak of and hope
they kicked out all the generic bullshit,

1907
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:51,060
typical airport concessionaire
food, Chili's, brands,

1908
01:57:51,570 --> 01:57:52,600
all that crap.
Right?

1909
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:57,990
Then they invited in local
restaurant tours, local chefs,

1910
01:57:57,991 --> 01:58:02,220
local craft beer makers, gave
them all killer deals. He said,

1911
01:58:02,221 --> 01:58:05,880
come and rich,
our airport communicate Detroit,

1912
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:10,020
why people should be in Detroit.
The Passion, the craft of Detroit.

1913
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:12,930
Be a part of that,
which is just killer.

1914
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:17,990
It's my friend's restaurant just got put
in there and he's super stoked. It's,

1915
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,060
it's, it's, it's a win win. Detroit
was depressing when I was there,

1916
01:58:21,061 --> 01:58:23,610
but one of the things that was kind
of cool was that I was seeing like a

1917
01:58:23,611 --> 01:58:27,990
resurgence of all these very small sort
of craft businesses and that'll be the

1918
01:58:27,991 --> 01:58:31,460
only thing that'll ever save Detroit,
in my humble opinion. And he has,

1919
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:35,970
you get past the topical depression.
It's a very inspiring place.

1920
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:37,260
Yeah. There's, there's,

1921
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:42,040
there's opportunity because the real
estate is insanely cheap and there's, you

1922
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:45,010
know, there's young people and young
people or young people everywhere,

1923
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:47,200
they have hopes and passions and they,

1924
01:58:47,201 --> 01:58:49,110
they have the internet and
they look around, they go,

1925
01:58:49,111 --> 01:58:53,070
that's a fucking building right here,
man. Let's just do this. And boom. Yeah.

1926
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:56,640
Let me look what Shinola is done. Am
I, I dunno, which I know have done. Oh,

1927
01:58:56,641 --> 01:59:00,280
should I know this is cool brand that
does watches and I thought it was like,

1928
01:59:00,281 --> 01:59:02,770
Shit. I know. I thought what
it's like a term that's,

1929
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:05,050
that's where they got the new shoe Polish.

1930
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:08,740
It was back a pre World War II and
that's where they got the name from it.

1931
01:59:08,741 --> 01:59:10,210
You don't know shit from Shinola.

1932
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:15,010
They're parallel being more
product with purpose and story.

1933
01:59:15,430 --> 01:59:19,570
So like, Oh, you bought that, you don't
know shit from Shinola. This is Shinola.

1934
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:24,280
A watch. Oh, it started as a watch.

1935
01:59:24,281 --> 01:59:26,770
Then they own Filson.

1936
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:32,460
Then they've got a wonderful
American northwest cultural icon,

1937
01:59:32,981 --> 01:59:37,490
leather goods outdoors company.
So yeah, they, they do, uh,

1938
01:59:37,630 --> 01:59:42,630
bags and watches and bicycles and
leather goods and they're getting into

1939
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,290
notebooks and all sorts of stuff.

1940
01:59:47,291 --> 01:59:52,291
But their whole thing is the cultural
renaissance of Detroit supporting Detroit.

1941
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:58,660
They're opening up facilities in old worn
out industrial buildings, re-purposing.

1942
01:59:58,661 --> 02:00:02,800
I'm training local kids to
build it like their watches.

1943
02:00:02,801 --> 02:00:06,940
They're assembling their own movements
in Detroit and training people because

1944
02:00:06,941 --> 02:00:08,140
there wasn't a skillset for it.

1945
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:13,680
So it's those efforts times a
billion at companies large and small,

1946
02:00:14,350 --> 02:00:17,290
that are the future of our
country. And I think, uh,

1947
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:20,260
most poignantly with Detroit near term.
Well.

1948
02:00:20,261 --> 02:00:22,580
It's one of those things
I think that when you,

1949
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:24,970
you see like a lack of opportunity.

1950
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,890
You see people sort of try to
create their own opportunities.

1951
02:00:27,891 --> 02:00:30,670
He engineered by either stealing
the copper out of your building

1952
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:37,420
Sao Paulo style, steal your
car, redistribute wealth
problem solved or yeah,

1953
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:42,220
like stopping and thinking and engage.
You can't find a job. Make a job. Yeah.

1954
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:46,290
Well Detroit has a real problem with them
stealing pipes and stuff that they're

1955
02:00:46,300 --> 02:00:47,680
doing that from a lot of buildings,
rain,

1956
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:51,430
but I just do love the fact that
when you've, you find a dip,

1957
02:00:51,431 --> 02:00:54,550
like we were talking about with
Cuba where they don't have any cars,

1958
02:00:54,551 --> 02:00:57,550
so let's just figure out a way to make
these fucking cars weren't making it work

1959
02:00:57,940 --> 02:01:01,240
and what you're seeing in a lot of these
other places where there's not a lot of

1960
02:01:01,241 --> 02:01:02,620
great jobs,
there's not a lot,

1961
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:05,180
so they're creating their own
possibilities and creating that.

1962
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:10,210
It's happened for so long that it's become
a source of pride for their culture,

1963
02:01:10,690 --> 02:01:15,280
which then makes it that
much more important. Exactly.
Exactly. Exactly. Listen man,

1964
02:01:15,281 --> 02:01:17,830
you've got a busy company
to run and I really,

1965
02:01:17,831 --> 02:01:20,470
really appreciate your time and I'm sure
you have a lot of stuff you have to get

1966
02:01:20,471 --> 02:01:20,711
done,

1967
02:01:20,711 --> 02:01:24,940
but it is important to do and I really
appreciate you taking the time to really

1968
02:01:24,941 --> 02:01:29,640
come to the shop and kind of
really understand or lunacy and uh,

1969
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:33,920
it's an awesomely impressive, awesomely
impressive and inspirational. Uh,

02:01:33,921 --> 02:01:38,500

02:01:59,931 --> 02:02:03,200
