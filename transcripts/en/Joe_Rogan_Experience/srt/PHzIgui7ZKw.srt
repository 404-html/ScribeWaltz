Enjoy comedic stylings of crystally.
Somebody.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,660
What's up,
man?

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,640
Dude,
your shit is out right now.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,790
It's actually done so happy.
I'm doing this and we're going to talk 

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,180
for a few hours because I can't stop 
checking my fucking phone on twitter.

10
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:28,500
Like an asshole.
I know,

11
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,320
I know it.
I,

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,690
I think I think,
oh,

13
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:32,460
I won't do it.
And then I'll be like,

14
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:33,360
don't do it.
Don't do it.

15
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:35,520
And as I'm doing it,
I'm thinking I better not be doing it.

16
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:37,080
And I'm like,
I'm doing it fucking right now.

17
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,450
You got to have other activities.
No,

18
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,430
I know I work out,
but then and then I,

19
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:44,310
I,
I do stand up and I know it's a problem.

20
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,540
It's a problem.
You know what I mean?

21
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,710
Yeah.
Well you're,

22
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:48,720
you're very dedicated to it.
You love it.

23
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,580
And when you love it,
you think about it a lot.

24
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:51,620
When you think about a lot,
and little.

25
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,630
Let me check twitter.
I know it's also such a safety kind of 

26
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,880
just move that you,
you,

27
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,040
you,
I mean we talked about this before.

28
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,860
It's just like fucking you put up,
put your phone down for a day.

29
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:02,370
So I'm,
you know,

30
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,930
what I've been doing lately that has 
been more productive when I know I can't

31
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:10,200
give in to go over my notes.
That's good.

32
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,630
What I find man,
I find that like what I'm,

33
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,800
what I'm doing is just distracting my I,
I was talking about this on my podcast,

34
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:17,640
man.
I used to,

35
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,850
I used to think I used to just spend 
time thinking like just spend time in my

36
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:26,430
house or apartment,
just thinking about things.

37
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,540
I don't do that as much anymore because 
I just think what's,

38
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,220
what did this fucking guy stay on 
twitter?

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,470
It robs you of your creativity.
So it's like,

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,840
I mean it's hard to be prolific when 
you're just looking at your phone and it

41
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:43,920
does something to you when you just get 
mindless tweets and you're still looking

42
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,570
at them.
It's just,

43
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,140
it's like a numbing agent.
Yeah,

44
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:47,380
it's weird.
It's not.

45
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:48,450
I mean,
because what are you going to see?

46
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,040
Somebody likes your special.
Okay,

47
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:50,730
good.
Well,

48
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:55,731
I do follow a lot of cool people that 
will post up some cool shit and some 

49
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:57,270
articles and shit.
When people send me those,

50
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:59,520
I try to retreat the ones that I think 
are interesting.

51
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,960
So there's a benefit to it there.
But sure.

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,280
The real you get lost.
Like checking how people like things 

53
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,260
that show.
Was that a good channel Sharon?

54
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,350
My tire now.
I know.

55
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,510
Yeah.
But you're right.

56
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:19,740
Like your time is better spent trying to
do more stuff,

57
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,980
do more comedy,
but it's a thief of your time really is 

58
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:24,980
really.
Is,

59
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,690
is it really is designed for them?
No,

60
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,350
I,
I,

61
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,720
you know,
I,

62
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,960
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.

63
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,050
I ever see a person who's got epilepsy 
where they can't watch one of those 

64
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,261
animated Gif files.
I had a buddy of mine and I thought he 

65
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:40,530
was joking.
I didn't know was being honest.

66
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:43,290
I had this message board and on my 
website,

67
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:48,291
a message board.
Someone made me like this really flashy 

68
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,200
image for the face where it's like it 
turns on and off.

69
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:54,201
You know,
pulsates if an my friend's wife has 

70
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:54,600
epilepsy and he's like,
dude,

71
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:57,480
you got to take that down because of my 
wife looks at it.

72
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,640
She'll have a seizure.
Whoa.

73
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,010
Like a

74
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,360
Jeff?
Yeah,

75
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,770
like an animated Gif or Jif or Gif or 
Jif.

76
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,580
I don't know.
I had a big debate,

77
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,080
jeff slash Gif,
but he can't.

78
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,010
She can't even look at it.
Looks at it.

79
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,100
She will go into an epileptic seizure.
Well,

80
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,270
how do you police that?
You just don't look online ever.

81
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,170
I guess they have to be real careful of 
like what she sees.

82
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,020
I guess like maybe if she turns away 
real quick,

83
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,380
maybe she'd be okay.
I don't.

84
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:32,381
I really don't know how it works.
Maybe she has to wear special glasses 

85
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,490
when she looks at a online,
so I don't know what's like.

86
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,610
Could you imagine you've got some sort 
of a weird misfire were just lights will

87
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:42,460
make your body shut off.
It's like someone hacked your brain.

88
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,970
He could shut it off with some light,
some flashing shit.

89
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:47,410
That's like some.
Yeah,

90
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,300
that's like the superheroes weakness 
where you're like,

91
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:50,710
well,
get with flashing lights,

92
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,700
crypto new.

93
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,030
Right.
Because Kryptonite doesn't even work on 

94
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,030
us.
No,

95
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,180
it doesn't do shit.
I'm such a pussy.

96
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,070
I ain't no.
And in one of the superman movies,

97
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:03,460
they didn't even have Kryptonite in the 
one in the one superman movie was.

98
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,650
But before the one before it superman or
Batman,

99
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,980
I saw it and the bad guy didn't even use
Kryptonite.

100
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:12,660
So you couldn't destroy Superman.
So is this what the fuck is this movie?

101
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,740
Even a movie because people are stupider
now.

102
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:17,740
They had to tone it down to like back in
the Christopher Reeve days,

103
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:20,020
you need to have like an antagonist and 
protagonist.

104
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,670
He didn't have a lot of people today 
like,

105
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,990
Oh,
don't want super cute.

106
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,830
Because then there'll be some sort of 
group that finds it offensive.

107
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,930
Oh,
that's true too,

108
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,980
right?
Yeah.

109
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,400
So these flashing things,
when I found out about it that flashing 

110
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,451
animated files and then I found out 
there was a television show in Japan 

111
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,560
that they had to take off the air.
No,

112
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,070
because all these people were watching 
it and having seizures in Japan.

113
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,130
Yes.
I feel like every show in Japan is 

114
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,531
flashing lights.
I feel like they have a show called 

115
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:52,531
flashing lights.
They have the flush with athlete network

116
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:53,810
and they're just can't.
I mean,

117
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,950
isn't it every every clip I've ever seen
in Japan is like pink and blue and like 

118
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,400
what if all they saw us as fear factor.

119
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,130
That's probably what they would choose 
to watch,

120
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,920
but maybe they have some cool shit over 
there,

121
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:07,210
but we're only seeing,
you know,

122
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:10,050
like when,
how many donkey Dick Kenya smiles.

123
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,560
True what,
what is this?

124
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,830
And poking a band pokemon episode that 
gave children's seizures.

125
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,800
I mean I thought the whole point was of 
Pokemon was to give people seizures.

126
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,840
My God,
700 children were on their way to the 

127
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,050
hospital.
After watching that,

128
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,170
30 minutes after the show,
700 children went to the hospital for 

129
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,970
seizures.
Is that what it's really saying?

130
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,280
That's incredible.
Could you imagine a room of 700 people?

131
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:36,430
It's like you're killing,
right?

132
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:37,850
If you have a stage.
Oh yeah.

133
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,050
If you had a stage.
I always think of it in terms of that 

134
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,301
dude,
I always think of how many people in 

135
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,221
terms of like how big of a room with 
that Phil as a standup to say I got 

136
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,520
already should fear to feel really good 
about his twitter following back when he

137
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:49,330
only had 2000.

138
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,020
I go,
dude,

139
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,960
you have a fucking sold out theater.
Totally.

140
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,520
He was like,
yeah,

141
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,710
you got to sold out theater.
People are paying attention to you.

142
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:57,470
I was like,
yeah,

143
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,000
well what am I do?
I go,

144
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,400
yeah.
You say,

145
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,660
well,
you're looking at Britney spears.

146
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,230
She can't do that man.
Fuck your head up.

147
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,550
She has $100 million.
Right?

148
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,870
But uh,
yeah,

149
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:08,840
there's something about that is crazy 
man.

150
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,210
700 people having a seizure in front of 
you.

151
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,970
Imagine if you are on stage and the 
whole audience just seizures.

152
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,410
I would just be like,
Whoa,

153
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,440
I'm next level band from New York 
seizure and people,

154
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,980
we should have taped this one too to 
Leanne's this pit.

155
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,520
He strips down to his underwear.
It's underwear,

156
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:29,170
a bright silver and started doing 
cartwheels and people seizure.

157
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,710
I've never seen anything like it.
Yeah,

158
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,380
that'd be a hell of a claim.
Well,

159
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:35,450
you could probably pull something like 
that off.

160
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,060
I wonder if you could make someone 
seizure with comedy.

161
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,290
You would have to imagine if you have 
like some sort of back screen on your 

162
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:43,400
punchline,
your punchline,

163
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,210
you rip your track suit off like one of 
those velcro things.

164
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,090
Those basketball players have terrible 
and they pull their tear away.

165
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:55,091
Yeah.
And underneath it you have strobing 

166
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:55,091
lights on the punchline.

167
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,780
The punchline.
I said,

168
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:57,550
yeah,
there is.

169
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,310
And just everyone with epilepsy just 
falls to the ground.

170
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:09,311
I wonder if it would be silent though.
I like to hear the noise whenever we 

171
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,250
would certainly hear thoughts.
Imagine that a group thought that 

172
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,990
crosses across the city here the fuck 
was.

173
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:18,470
That would be 700 people falling down 
their heads.

174
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,730
I'm terrible for you.
Definitely don't want to flesh that out,

175
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,560
but I don't like,
you know,

176
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,230
flashing lights anywhere.
There's flashing lights.

177
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:25,880
I'm not epileptic anywhere.
There's flashing lights.

178
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:27,520
I tend to avoid that place.
Yeah.

179
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,730
I wonder what that's doing to you.
We May.

180
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:32,990
Maybe if it's a person like you or 
doesn't have epilepsy,

181
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,340
maybe it's just a certain amount of 
time.

182
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:35,990
Maybe you could only endure a certain 
amount.

183
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,860
I would think so.
Right?

184
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:39,380
Because when they torture you seen those
videos and shit.

185
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:44,381
Where do they like,
I mean not torture videos but like re 

186
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,020
reenactments or like things in movies 
where they're flashing lights and 

187
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,020
torturing the guy.

188
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,020
That's part of it,
right?

189
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,000
The senses.
Sensory deprivation,

190
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,870
the water,
Chinese water torture.

191
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,990
Every would just little drips drips.
Yeah.

192
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,630
Have you read that Jon Ronson Book?
Men who stare at goats?

193
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,010
Yes.
You've had them on here,

194
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:58,650
right?
I have.

195
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,390
That book is crazy.
How they would torture people by playing

196
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,530
like hip hop music or whatever the fuck 
it was.

197
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,980
There's been a well with Panama.
What the fuck is that guy?

198
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,450
Manuel Noriega what they.
I think they used to play death metal.

199
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,870
I think they used to pay them.
They like that kind of shit,

200
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,290
but I get that because if I'm in 
anywhere and then that happens.

201
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,870
I leave.
I think they played uptown girl too from

202
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:28,480
Billy Joel and I'm not kidding.
Really.

203
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,110
I think that was one of the things they 
did.

204
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,180
They played uptown curl and bring beer 
song too.

205
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:37,160
I think that's a bad pr.
Good pr for them.

206
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,680
One side.
Good.

207
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,540
One time you hear that song,
you're like,

208
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,620
oh,
I remember this song is good.

209
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,770
I have a theory about that song.
What billy Joel is an incredibly 

210
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:52,961
talented musician,
but not the best looking guy in the 

211
00:08:52,961 --> 00:08:52,961
world.
Can we agree on that?

212
00:08:52,961 --> 00:08:52,961
Oh yeah.
Yeah,

213
00:08:52,961 --> 00:08:53,930
of course.
Sure.

214
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,100
Right.
He's.

215
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,610
I'm Josh Duhamel.

216
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,430
Yeah,
right.

217
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,520
Who is another one that's like perfect 
to mount a Chris Pine.

218
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,240
Chris Pine.
Yeah.

219
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:04,470
He's a good looking guy.
There is a good one.

220
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,150
And Chris Pratt.
There's another one,

221
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,050
but he's a good looking guy.
Yeah.

222
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,780
Great looking guys.
You just Elba.

223
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,610
Perfect.
You added a little diversity.

224
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:13,060
I want it to go a little too.
Good.

225
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,370
Mood enhancer.
Bastard.

226
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,910
Billy Joel is an average looking fella 
and then he hooked up with arguably one 

227
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:21,540
of the hottest woman that stuff.
Christie Brinkley.

228
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,950
Yeah,
and that just fucked him up.

229
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,070
What do you mean?
Oh yeah.

230
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,290
That's where it is.
He was chilling.

231
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,280
Love.
He wanted to tell everybody this story.

232
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:37,500
Uptown girl,
he's downtown guy,

233
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,680
he says he wants to think of themselves 
as like this rugged,

234
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,920
attractive,
rebel bad boy motorcycle and she's this 

235
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,000
perfect featured supermodel with him.
Impossibly valuable eggs.

236
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,270
That's interesting.
Yeah.

237
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,250
Rectal couldn't handle it,
but.

238
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,970
But he got even bigger after that.
That doesn't matter.

239
00:09:57,971 --> 00:09:59,670
I,
I hear what you're saying and she was so

240
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:00,760
hot,
but he's not.

241
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,550
She's still hot.
She's like 17.

242
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,640
My favorite is her in the Chuck Norris.
What do you call it?

243
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,540
Total gym.
Oh,

244
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,520
that's right.
When they would do the little dude,

245
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,230
I,
I would watch that info.

246
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,410
I love infomercials.
I watched them late at night and that 

247
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,050
was my favorite infomercial and then 
they remade it.

248
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,110
Oh yeah.
And I didn't like it as much as the 

249
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,661
original.
That's how much I watch because the 

250
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:23,661
original was so good because Chuck 
Norris was like,

251
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:28,160
let's just fucking get through this.
And Christie Brinkley was doing it 

252
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,311
really well,
but it was just so funny to see Chuck 

253
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:31,311
Norris has faced during that and then 
read did it and he figured it out.

254
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,150
He figured out how to do a little better
and I didn't like that dude.

255
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,460
I met Chuck Norris.
I met him a couple times.

256
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,240
This was the proudest moment in my life 
and Chuck Norris knew who I was.

257
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,070
Oh Wow.
For Real.

258
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,110
For real meat.
And Chuck Norris,

259
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:44,520
he comes and gives you a big hug.
I was like,

260
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,670
Holy Shit.
Chuck Norris from just the UFC.

261
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:50,760
I'm sure you know,
this was not that long ago.

262
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,810
No.
Oh Wow.

263
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,020
My first met him,
I think maybe it was 10 years ago.

264
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,430
Wow.
Okay.

265
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,840
And then I met him again,
I think about two years ago.

266
00:10:57,841 --> 00:10:59,220
I met him again.
That's funny.

267
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,730
I wish I was thinking about guys like 
that that were like big that got big off

268
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:07,710
of martial arts in the eighties and 
nineties and then the UFC came along and

269
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:09,900
like kind of made those martial arts,
you know,

270
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,430
fighting sense,
obsolete,

271
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,300
right.
You know,

272
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,410
like if they would be that.
I guess that's not gonna happen anymore 

273
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:17,410
really.

274
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:17,410
I mean,
I don't know.

275
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,320
It is know what you're saying,
but like Kung Fu movies are obviously 

276
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,070
more beautiful than a.
what's that movie that Calvin did?

277
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:23,960
The play.
Don,

278
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,570
what was that?
Yeah.

279
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,610
Well,
the thing about Chuck Norris though is 

280
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,441
that he stayed current.
Chuck Norris is a black belt in 

281
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:33,441
Brazilian Jujitsu.
Oh,

282
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:33,441
he is?
Yeah.

283
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:36,690
He's legit under the Machados and on top
of that he was a world champion.

284
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:37,740
Kickboxer,
right?

285
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:42,741
Yeah.
It was like he could grapple at a very 

286
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:42,741
high level and he can.
Oh,

287
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:47,211
I was a world champion striker.
Chuck Norris has a bout as legit as any 

288
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:51,000
like movie character,
tough guy about as legit as they've ever

289
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:56,001
been.
Especially a guy who went on to do all 

290
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:58,651
these great movies like Bruce Lee was a 
phenomenal martial artists in a 

291
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,130
brilliant guy in terms of how we put 
things together.

292
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,570
But as far as like actual competition,
Chuck Norris is the man.

293
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,430
I mean he was.
He was the guy.

294
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,780
Like when I was a kid,
dude like Chuck Norris movies of the 

295
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,790
reason why I got into martial arts 
really too.

296
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,560
He was huge and jeans on with a special 
crotch jeans.

297
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:21,561
They had a special crotch cutting the 
jeans so I can fucking side and cowboy 

298
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:22,180
boots on.
I saw the,

299
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,180
I found out about action jeans a late in
life and I was like,

300
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:27,490
that was a fucking thing,
dude.

301
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:32,491
I W I basically wear them.
I mean w what I wear now is more 

302
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:34,670
ridiculous than Chuck Norris is actually
tells.

303
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,120
The Times have changed.
I mean I have jogged genes which is like

304
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:42,121
fucking.
They're strengths what I'm talking 

305
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:42,121
about.
Yeah.

306
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:42,121
That's what I'm wearing to.
It didn't sound much more comfortable.

307
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:42,430
Way more comfortable.
Yeah.

308
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:44,790
These were bullshit.
Like when you had a stroke,

309
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,300
kick blind your legs.

310
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,030
When we would get pants,
if I got pants,

311
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:52,180
I always got pants that were too big for
me just so I can kick people.

312
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,110
Oh,
a quarter.

313
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:57,040
Make people just in case it never 
happened.

314
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,200
Never happened.
Ever.

315
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,760
My,
my buddy,

316
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:02,020
when I was,
when I used to train,

317
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,160
you know,
I trained when I was like 20 to 26 and 

318
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,160
my buddy was like,
why do you do that?

319
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,690
And I was like,
I don't know,

320
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:09,250
just to like protect myself.
He was like,

321
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:10,540
yeah,
but what's happening to you?

322
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,220
And I was like,
well,

323
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:13,570
you never know.
And he said,

324
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,940
yeah you do.
And I was like,

325
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,650
yeah,
you're kind of fucking right man.

326
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,380
Most of the time you do.
He's kind of writing in these.

327
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:25,381
Definitely not right all the time 
because obviously people get fucked up 

328
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:25,381
all the time of course,
but he was like,

329
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:30,001
you kind of know where you're always 
going to be and it's going to be fine 

330
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:30,001
and it Kinda time.

331
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:30,130
Most of the time I know you just meet 
General.

332
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:31,510
Obviously you never know what's going to
happen,

333
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,370
but.
But he's right in the sense that you put

334
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:37,380
so much effort into self defense and it 
almost never comes up.

335
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:37,630
Right?
Right.

336
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,620
Like eating like,
wow,

337
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:40,870
your whole life is preparing for 
something that never took place.

338
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:43,150
And then you get to a point where if 
you're known for it,

339
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,890
like you,
like nobody's gonna fuck with you.

340
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:49,891
So it's like den,
it's definitely never going to have 

341
00:13:49,891 --> 00:13:49,891
true.
No,

342
00:13:49,891 --> 00:13:52,591
you're right.
You probably got fucking assholes that 

343
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:52,591
want to fuck with chocolate Dell.
That's so great.

344
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:53,500
That's so insane to me.
Yeah,

345
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,550
I mean chocolate,
Dell,

346
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:55,610
if you ever look in his eyes,
he,

347
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,660
the eyes of a leopard seal,
like you look in his eyes fucking 

348
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,880
straight up like anybody who talks shit.
And by the way,

349
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,060
Super Nice Guy,
like,

350
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,940
don't get me wrong if you met him on the
street,

351
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,900
he's the nicest guy.

352
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,700
He's super friendly.
Saw his thing with,

353
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,850
uh,
like undisputed or whatever the hell 

354
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:14,850
that show's called with A.
Yeah,

355
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:14,850
you seem like a nice guy.
Anyway,

356
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,050
dude,
I was at a club with chocolate though,

357
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:22,000
way back in the day when chuck was the 
UFC light heavyweight champ and some guy

358
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,960
said something to one of his friends and
it was like some douche moment who knows

359
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:29,630
what was going on.
Just a bunch of silly pizza,

360
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,340
you know.
And um,

361
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,660
his buddies,
everybody's meatheads meatheads on both 

362
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,901
sides.
This guy came over and said something 

363
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:41,680
and Chuck Odell stood up,
turned around and looked at him and this

364
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:45,850
guy looked like he saw a fucking ghost.
He looked into chuck's eyes.

365
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,200
There's like a,
there's a,

366
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,470
there's a type of dude that you don't 
start fights with,

367
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:50,880
right?
Yeah.

368
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,790
But meanwhile still people fuck with 
them.

369
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,500
To this day,
people fuck with that.

370
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,490
I guess it's kind of the equivalent as 
somebody going up to a comedian thinking

371
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:03,491
that they're funny and doing a job,
they will walk up to the scariest 

372
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:06,200
motherfucker on the face of the planet 
and start shit with them.

373
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:11,201
I'm afraid you bitch.
There's got to be guys who do that to 

374
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,110
allister or brock lesnar people are 
retarded.

375
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:17,170
So weird.
All you gotta do is shake one of these 

376
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:17,170
guys' hands and you're like,
oh,

377
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:17,580
you're a tree.
Unbelievable.

378
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,540
Good tape.
Fletcher's hand.

379
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:21,650
You're like,
oh,

380
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:25,430
you're a fucking your cattle.
Do you know what I mean?

381
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,600
He's,
yeah,

382
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:28,440
he's a small moose.
I mean even you do it.

383
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,170
I honestly,
one of the times we've said,

384
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:35,171
hi,
I s I shit you not and I'm not blowing 

385
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:35,171
smoke.
We said,

386
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:38,741
hi,
we did one of these and one of those 

387
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:38,741
fucking side hugs you my jaw hit your 
fucking shoulder.

388
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:43,480
And for two days I was like,
I think it's okay to kind of get out 

389
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:44,370
more.
You get it,

390
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,260
it's good for you to get that.
But like,

391
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:49,850
it just hit the wrong way,
you know what I mean?

392
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:53,540
It was like John's or weak man.
Just stupid design.

393
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,180
It's the unfair part of the human body 
besides Dick and balls.

394
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,350
Yeah.
Have you ever been dropped?

395
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:00,140
You ever been punched and dropped in the
balls?

396
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,990
No.
No children?

397
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,670
No.
No,

398
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:02,860
no.
It's the weirdest thing,

399
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,490
man.
I've been rocked before,

400
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,780
but I got dropped once in a kickboxing 
fight and my legs just gave out.

401
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,840
We're like,
it's never happened like that before 

402
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:13,850
where it's like a switch shut off.
I was totally conscious.

403
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:18,851
I could see the guy.
It clipped my chin and my legs just 

404
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:20,360
stopped working so it just went out from
under me and I see.

405
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,540
I feel like if I,
if I got hit in the jaw with a foot,

406
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,160
I.
my job would just break.

407
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,180
Yeah.
This was a punch.

408
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:29,750
I got hit with a left hook and a I just 
dropped.

409
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,810
But it was,
it was weirder than anytime I've ever 

410
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:34,810
dropped before.
It was just,

411
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,550
it was a everything shut off like.
But my brain did,

412
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,920
but my legs just stopped working.
And so did you remember?

413
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:43,310
It totally went unconscious.
I was totally conscious.

414
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,650
It just my body went.
Once he clipped me,

415
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:50,420
my body just wasn't working anymore.
It was like,

416
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,030
took a break.
I tried to get up,

417
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:56,300
my legs were rubber and I got up to my 
feet and I covered up and he hit me with

418
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,250
a couple of upper cuts and drop me 
again.

419
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,500
Um,
but the whole time,

420
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:02,110
like my body was just not working 
anymore.

421
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,160
Once he clipped me.
Oh really?

422
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,480
Like,
even,

423
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,900
even,
even minutes afterwards for sure.

424
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,780
Wow.
I couldn't move.

425
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,840
Like I was trying to get up and just 
wasn't working.

426
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:12,590
Right.
Oh my God,

427
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:14,390
that's got to be frustrated.
Well,

428
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:17,210
if you get hit really hard there,
then the whole thing just shuts off.

429
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,380
It's such a stupid design.
Yeah,

430
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,220
I think it's relatively hard to knock 
someone out unless you hit.

431
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,420
Oh,
that's weird.

432
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,560
Like people get caught in strange ways 
and they get not like there's no science

433
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:30,260
to when you get knocked out.
Well also you've got to worry about like

434
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,680
when you're hitting the ground too,
like that could fuck you up.

435
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,830
Well,
there was a UFC fighter named Tim Hank 

436
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,380
who just died a week,
a week or so ago,

437
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,480
about a week ago,
um,

438
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,510
he was in a boxing match and apparently 
it's suffered quite a few knockouts in 

439
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,150
the last uh,
year or so,

440
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,320
and they really probably shouldn't have 
been fighting it all.

441
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,630
And he got knocked out and as he got 
killed,

442
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:54,630
his head hit the ground hard because he 
was out cold.

443
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,500
He bounced off the canvas of the,
a boxing ring and it sounded horrible,

444
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,710
but it was even,
even though it was Kansas,

445
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:01,770
I mean that's hard,
but still,

446
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,800
I think it's canvas over wood though.
I mean they have like thin,

447
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,670
like a UFC belt.
You got a good thick,

448
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,390
fairly thick canvas because there's so 
many take downs and you know,

449
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,710
broader slams and stuff like that just 
to give to that floor.

450
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,100
But on boxing rings it can be 
considerably stiffer.

451
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,740
And there's different schools of 
thought,

452
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:27,741
like some people like a really soft 
floor because it makes it harder for 

453
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,160
guys to run.
Like it's almost like running in sand,

454
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,540
you know.
And then,

455
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,670
and also safer if you get more of a 
matte.

456
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,780
Yeah,
more of a matte.

457
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,140
Yeah.
But the UFC is like,

458
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,680
it's like a matte surface,
but it's covered in canvas,

459
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,270
which is kind of fucked up because you 
never grapple on canvas until you fight.

460
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,700
And occasionally you'd get ripped up.
Everybody gets torn apart by the canvas.

461
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,440
Yeah.
I went back rough.

462
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,500
I went back and did a,
uh,

463
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,760
you saw the video I did with the Joe 
Garcia.

464
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:51,830
You Know Joel?
Yes.

465
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Yes.
I don't know if you guys met but we 

466
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:56,840
never met.
But uh,

467
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:56,840
I was big fan of his.
Yeah.

468
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,710
He um,
he submitted.

469
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,640
Fuck.
Who Was it?

470
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:00,660
Was it saccharide?
No,

471
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,220
it wasn't soccer.
I Asian guy.

472
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:04,770
Right.
A room in a though he submitted to pen,

473
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,220
Ya know,
I don't know,

474
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,970
think it was.
Maybe it was in Japan.

475
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,160
He went overseas.
I know,

476
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,560
but it was a huge deal because Rwanda 
Sato at the time was one of the biggest 

477
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,840
mma fighters in the world.

478
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,140
Pull that up if that's what it was.
Mostly that I think it's ruined.

479
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:27,141
I believe it's sotto.
Sotto was like a super high level 

480
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:29,280
Jujitsu competitor as well as a mixed 
martial arts fighter.

481
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,430
Yeah,
because Joel said that he.

482
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,120
It was like the.
I can't remember he was saying he wasn't

483
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:41,121
sure how practical his knowledge of 
fighting was until then.

484
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,210
Huh?
That's interesting because he got the 

485
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,210
guy in an arm bar,
um,

486
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,570
after going right to the ground and he 
was like,

487
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:50,630
it was over right then,
you know,

488
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,730
you know what man,
there's dudes out there that you don't 

489
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,221
know the fucking world class.
The thing about Jujitsu is there's guys 

490
00:19:58,221 --> 00:19:59,190
out there.
Yeah.

491
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:00,270
That was.
This is it.

492
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:01,410
Is this it?
Yeah.

493
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:01,840
This is it.

494
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,170
Um.

495
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,260
Oh,
this is good down.

496
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,960
It's not long.
I guess it's four minutes,

497
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,660
but I feel like this is the second 
fight.

498
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:19,020
I think this is the one and he gets him 
down on the ground and that doesn't 

499
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,150
honor bar.
Yeah,

500
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,570
yeah,
yeah.

501
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,950
I don't know dude.
Didn't they fight twice?

502
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:24,190
Didn't I?

503
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,030
Once.
Oh,

504
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,840
this is it.
Yeah.

505
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,270
Yeah.
I think he fucked his arm up and 

506
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,720
obviously.
Oh Dude,

507
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,370
that is incredible,
man.

508
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,370
Oh look,
look how bad it's been.

509
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:41,410
Mash.
That is death to look how he squeezes 

510
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,521
with his calf against the Chin and Tuxes
foot under the shoulder that that dude 

511
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:48,140
is submitted a lot of fucking people.
Guy Was a big

512
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,320
Jujitsu guy that he fought.
I didn't know that.

513
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:54,100
Sato Sato is a big MMA fighter,
but known for his grappling.

514
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:59,190
Really.
I think they fought again in a straight 

515
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,500
grappling thing,
if I remember correctly.

516
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,870
But anyway,
that was a giant wind for that dude.

517
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,850
Yeah.
So you did something with him?

518
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,420
No,
I went to his class because I was in 

519
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,120
Toronto for like five weeks doing a 
movie and was the movie.

520
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,400
It's called life in a year and it's a 
drama.

521
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,120
I don't know if you plan it drugs.
Are you being serious?

522
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:17,980
Yeah.
I don't even know which will probably be

523
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,480
funnier.

524
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,520
Was it weird?
You know what's weird about it is like,

525
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:30,030
you know,
I do so much comedy that it's so fun to 

526
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,080
do comedy because even in between your 
takes,

527
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:34,010
you're still in that mood where you're 
fucking around.

528
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:39,030
And I was doing this movie where 
literally I'm taking care of Cora 

529
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:44,790
Delavan who is dying of cancer and it's 
like so heavy and then in between takes 

530
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:50,860
or like sad.
Oh yeah.

531
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,410
Yeah.
So it's like it was work.

532
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,790
I mean it was,
it was definitely,

533
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,830
I definitely wanted to do it.
Um,

534
00:21:56,831 --> 00:22:01,831
it was just,
you want to do it because it's a new 

535
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:01,831
thing.
Yes.

536
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:01,831
I want it to do it because dude,
I,

537
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:03,550
especially after my third,
I had just filled my third special and I

538
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:08,551
was like,
what the fuck am I going to do another 

539
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:08,551
special,
you know what I mean?

540
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:08,551
Like I want to do something else.

541
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:09,760
I didn't want to do another sitcom 
because I did two of those,

542
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,590
you know what I mean?
And it just,

543
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:13,960
I don't want to do the same thing over 
and over and over again.

544
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,060
And so that's why this even on this 
special that just came out today,

545
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:24,061
it's like I talk more about myself than 
I did in my first two just because it's 

546
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:24,130
like,
I don't want to teach.

547
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:26,380
You keep making fun of the same shit.
Right?

548
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,520
Yeah.
I hear you man,

549
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,870
I hear Ya.
Yeah.

550
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:32,350
And like doing different things is where
you get new ideas from.

551
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,400
But yeah,
that acting things,

552
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:35,980
that grind.
Yeah,

553
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,020
I know,
I know

554
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,500
you complained about acting and I work 
in a coma.

555
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,860
Know it's,

556
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,940
it's uh,
it was,

557
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,540
it was,
it,

558
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,380
it was just boring.
I mean,

559
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,220
I don't want to disrespect it like that,
but it's like,

560
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:55,390
not that you're disrespecting you,
but it's just like the shit we do is so 

561
00:22:55,431 --> 00:23:00,431
exciting going on stage for an hour and 
everyone's listening and you're in 

562
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:03,830
control of what the fucking mood.
But then when you're just like the fifth

563
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:08,831
lead on a movie and you have one really 
great scene and the other scenes you're 

564
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:13,520
just kind of in with four characters and
you say shit like,

565
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,290
Oh yeah,
I remember that or something.

566
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,300
Do you know what I mean?
Oh,

567
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:18,950
well she was always a wild one.
You know what I mean?

568
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,980
When you say it's like that,
and you had to do that 19 times in a row

569
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:23,390
because I got to shoot it from different
angles.

570
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:28,870
And even though Cuba,
Cuba gooding junior's in the movie and 

571
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:28,870
you're like,
oh,

572
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:28,870
it's quite good to work with Cuba 
gooding Jr.

573
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,750
That's cool for like four takes and then
you're like,

574
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,840
I'm fucking hungry.
Where's my phone and why is There no 

575
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:34,840
wifi in this bullshit?
Do you know what I mean?

576
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,290
Yeah.
So yeah,

577
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:40,330
when people get bored working with Cuba 
gooding jr,

578
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,090
by no means am I complaining,
just like I realized doing standup is 

579
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,090
just such a fast paced,
fun lifestyle.

580
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,000
I mean,
and it's worked too,

581
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:52,880
but you know,
it's like we know it also.

582
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:55,520
It is standup as you like,
it's just you,

583
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:58,400
you do what you want to do.
Whereas these other things is.

584
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,650
And that's a weird thing to say.
People are like,

585
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:05,651
whoa,
you should enjoy work with other people 

586
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:05,651
and sure and career to have it.
And that's great.

587
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:09,401
But there's something about like knowing
that you put together your whole set 

588
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:13,751
beginning.
Then you figured out which way the shit 

589
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:13,751
should go.

590
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:13,940
And then like you go do somebody else's 
stuff,

591
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:14,690
you're like,
eh,

592
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,280
this isn't as engaging unless you're 
playing for me.

593
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:24,281
unless you're playing like a real 
character or like a or something that's 

594
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:24,800
funny and you get to ad lib and fuck 
around,

595
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,650
right?
Yeah,

596
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,480
yeah,
yeah.

597
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,120
It's a bit like some people thrive on 
it.

598
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,670
Some kind of thrive on it.
To me,

599
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,890
I know I've been,
I mean you lose a lot of them.

600
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,410
They start to just go to acting,
stay over there.

601
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,870
Somebody was telling me recently that 
they were bummed out about how and they.

602
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:44,660
And it was a good point about how,
you know,

603
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,020
people like fortune feemster who's 
hilarious,

604
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:53,050
like she doesn't have an especial yet 
because she's doing so much acting work 

605
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,060
and she's like a true comedian.
I think she's really fucking funny,

606
00:24:56,061 --> 00:25:01,061
but It's like,
well duncan trussell doesn't have a 

607
00:25:01,061 --> 00:25:01,061
special.
That's insane.

608
00:25:01,061 --> 00:25:02,120
There's another one that's insane,
but does he act?

609
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,620
No,
he just does.

610
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,730
What the fuck's he doing?

611
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,290
Yeah,
he's funny as shit though.

612
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,780
He's hilarious.
He's also nice as shit,

613
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:12,600
man.
It's the best.

614
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,150
But I mean for a guy that is as advanced
as he has,

615
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,690
he should absolutely have a special day.
She'd have another special for sure.

616
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:23,420
Especially because everybody has a 
special now.

617
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,260
Yeah.
I mean they're not even.

618
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:25,790
Especially when you call them specials 
anymore,

619
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,670
they're hours thing.
Yeah.

620
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,150
Maybe it's an hour.
Just call it an hour.

621
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:32,420
Yeah.
Diaz is going to do on netflix.

622
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,090
Oh yes.
You know that fucking guy.

623
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:36,530
Joey diaz coming in?
Netflix.

624
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,720
That guy is so funny.
I wonder if I'm not supposed to say 

625
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,250
that.
I might've made a scoop.

626
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,720
Well,
maybe you're wrong.

627
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,670
I fucked up.
Maybe I'm wrong.

628
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,820
Maybe you're Wrong.
Maybe I just made it up.

629
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,940
Maybe you just fucking saying shit.
Maybe I'll just talk it out of my hands 

630
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,260
were high.
Could be um,

631
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,140
yeah.

632
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,910
Uh,
that guy's so fucking funny.

633
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:57,950
I mean,
I think in burst,

634
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,980
no one's ever been funnier.
The burst of joy diaz can create 

635
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,290
onstage.
I've never heard anybody funnier.

636
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,460
Yeah.
It hurts my,

637
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,490
my cells.
Bone cells,

638
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:09,680
her laugh and he's like,
like him.

639
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:15,940
Brody makes me laugh hard just because 
he's ultimately holtzman is.

640
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,430
I mean that guy has killed me.
There's unknown ones.

641
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,320
Ones though.
It will.

642
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:26,840
They're free and they're the people.
Yeah.

643
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:28,670
People don't know what to make of him.
You know what I mean?

644
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,070
Yeah.
Yeah,

645
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,140
but the unknown ones,
man,

646
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,630
there's like a ton of those guys.
There was that one guy from long island?

647
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:41,180
what the fuck was his name again?
Bob?

648
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,900
Didn't we do this already?
Did we do this before where I was trying

649
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:48,180
to figure it out.
No,

650
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:49,350
not bob nelson.
Nelson.

651
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:50,900
Wasn't that guy with the boxing gloves?
Yes.

652
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,510
Jiffy.
Jeff's.

653
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:52,590
Jim.
Yeah.

654
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,220
He would hit himself and I mean,
how much comedy has changed.

655
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,110
Imagine doing that now.
I like 10,

656
00:26:58,111 --> 00:27:03,111
15 after you or me.
You can't even have props anymore about 

657
00:27:03,111 --> 00:27:03,510
this.
The other day With judd apatow,

658
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:08,511
we were like,
it used to be like a legit form of 

659
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:08,511
comedy,
like prop comedy.

660
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:12,600
I even feel like guitar,
you can't even bring a guitar nowadays.

661
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,430
There's a few of those guitars.
There's out there,

662
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:16,470
right?
There's a few.

663
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Yeah.
It used to be a fucking hard thing to 

664
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,430
follow on some different thing.
Yeah.

665
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Yeah.
If someone killed with a dirty song and 

666
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,360
then he had to go on after him,
I'm like,

667
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,360
damn,
all this dirt.

668
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,360
He's han.

669
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,850
But those guys,
uh,

670
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,090
they were like a bunch of those guys 
that would do shit like,

671
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,670
like harry bazell with,
with the movies and.

672
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,060
Yeah.
Um,

673
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,000
yeah,
yeah.

674
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,140
That shit killed back in the day.
I mean,

675
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,790
dude,
why up until 2010?

676
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,050
I woulD say the guy that left after I'd 
be like,

677
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,890
these people are dying.
I haven't seen them recently,

678
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:57,891
but no new kids coming up have a big bag
of fucking santa claus bag of props.

679
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,660
Like grant during some cringe when the 
grinch stole all the toys from the town 

680
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,990
and having to brIng a bunch of shit 
though.

681
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:09,270
That's one of the things I love about 
not being a musician.

682
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Yeah.
You know how people say like comedians 

683
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:14,480
secretly want to be rock stars.
Dude,

684
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,980
I couldn't think of.
I'd rather be a fucking crack dealer 

685
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,670
than a rockstar.
Anybody who says that has never killed.

686
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,620
Maybe like,
what are you talking about?

687
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,410
MaYbe the rockstar.
Get out of here.

688
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,480
I don't want to do that.
That Seems like a lot of work.

689
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,920
yeah,
it does.

690
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,770
Plus you got to be like with your 
bandmates all the time.

691
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,970
That nerves,
like you can't work with other people.

692
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,040
We can work with other people.
Like we know what the neighbors would 

693
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,070
get together on the road and the next 
week you could do a good gig with 

694
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,330
someone like you and no one goes,
hey,

695
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:43,890
what the fuck bro?
We're a team.

696
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,010
It's no like comedy teams like that.
I know.

697
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,080
That's good.
Oh,

698
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,660
that's just like the movie thing.
Plus you're on your own.

699
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:54,670
It's nice to deal with other people's 
bullshit.

700
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,910
Yeah.
It brought a new drummer bro.

701
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,280
We'll take a chance to san francisco 
with mike.

702
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,620
Man.
I always play the drums bad.

703
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,880
You know?
It's fucking bad.

704
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,830
As a single unit man,
you would have to be like a singer,

705
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:16,310
singer songwriter.
Like a Gary Clark junior hires his own 

706
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,581
people.
Like if gary Clark's juniors drummers 

707
00:29:19,581 --> 00:29:19,581
like,
fuck this,

708
00:29:19,581 --> 00:29:19,581
I'm out of here.
People were like,

709
00:29:19,581 --> 00:29:20,640
all right man.
Yeah,

710
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:22,560
you have to show your good.
but uh,

711
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,140
it's all,
it's all about the lead singer though,

712
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:29,170
because I mean,
unless you become like maybe the lead 

713
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,451
guitarist or something or like the 
violin player and the dave matthews 

714
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:32,451
band.
Yeah.

715
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:32,550
Like he was kinda see then even there 
though,

716
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:36,230
it's still the mother fucking david.
No problem with that son.

717
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:36,720
No,
I know.

718
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,430
But when it,
that's when it gets deep.

719
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,100
That's like a dictatorship when it's 
like the dave matthews,

720
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,820
tom petty and the heartbreakers.
Right.

721
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:45,460
Right.
But when it's like rush,

722
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,140
right then the rolling stone kiss.
Yeah.

723
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,440
Kiss every people in there.
Yeah.

724
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,840
No,
no,

725
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,010
no,
no.

726
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:56,470
You can't.
Can't switch the cat out for fox.

727
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,600
Okay.
That's not cool.

728
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,420
Oh man,
that's true though.

729
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,420
I never thought about that yet.
Name.

730
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,950
It's something.
Then everybody's kind of the group.

731
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,770
Everybody's in there.
If you're a heartbreaker though,

732
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,860
you're gone.
You're gone.

733
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,090
You know what you are.
You're a guitar and not get by.

734
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,520
Anyway.
Charlie daniels band.

735
00:30:16,521 --> 00:30:18,020
Motherfucker.
What does it say?

736
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,410
What does it say?
Steve miller as a site?

737
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,940
Charlie wilson says charlie fucking 
daniel's dryly because it's my band.

738
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:27,140
You piece of shit.
Yeah.

739
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,110
Nwa.
You can't get rid of fucking guy.

740
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,240
You can't get rid of any of those guys.
Yeah.

741
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:36,241
And all those guys became.
Except for maybe one when David Lee roth

742
00:30:36,891 --> 00:30:41,891
let fan,
halan and van hale was named after van 

743
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:41,891
halen.
How bout that shit?

744
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,860
Fucking van halen is the lead guitarist 
David Lee roth left and everybody went.

745
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,100
God damn crazy.
Yeah.

746
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,330
Cause it's van halen.
It's too of a name.

747
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,380
Even though it's your last name.
It's not the eddie van halen band.

748
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,570
Because if that was the case I'd be like
okay cool.

749
00:31:00,571 --> 00:31:01,680
I get it.
Different people.

750
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:06,681
It's like carlos santana.
Different people sing for them 

751
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:06,681
sometimes.
Right,

752
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:06,681
right,
right.

753
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:06,880
But it's still the carlos santana band.
Yeah.

754
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,120
Just don't be a fucking heartbreaker 
man.

755
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,180
But van halen seems like a like a thing.
Yeah,

756
00:31:12,181 --> 00:31:12,840
it is.
Yeah.

757
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:13,590
I didn't know.
I didn't even.

758
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,010
I guess I didn't even think I even put 
it together that it was his last name,

759
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:18,840
even though I knew that it's like a 
vehicle,

760
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,400
like a van halen.
It's a strong.

761
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

762
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,910
So it's like a hindenburg.
yeah,

763
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,150
it is.
Yeah.

764
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,660
Yeah.
You rogan.

765
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,680
That's good.
Delete is not a good one that got the 

766
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:33,680
apostrophe.
Fucks it all up.

767
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:33,720
The apostrophes are weird.
Why are we still using?

768
00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:34,980
No,
do we forget how to talk?

769
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,870
It's okay.
It's very weird.

770
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,570
I used to.
Yeah,

771
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,660
you don't have to tell me how to fucking
pronounce it.

772
00:31:42,661 --> 00:31:47,661
Just drop it by the way.
It makes it worse because people are 

773
00:31:47,661 --> 00:31:47,661
like leo,
leo,

774
00:31:47,661 --> 00:31:50,130
add fucking ells and shit.
When you go to like a restaurant,

775
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,190
you know what the worst is is when I 
pull into a gate,

776
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:56,500
you have a meetIng anywhere and you've 
got to give everybody that's thing.

777
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:01,740
And,
and I sit and then they say you're not 

778
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:01,740
in the system.
And I'm like,

779
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,220
try a with or without the apostrophe.
Whichever one you didn't do.

780
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:03,670
And then they're like,
oh,

781
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,730
there it is every fucking time.
Every fucking time.

782
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,350
You should change your last name 
spelling to de d,

783
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,690
h a h l e a h.
I don't know if the,

784
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,460
uh,
the uh,

785
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,690
I was little when I was little.
I told my dad,

786
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:30,170
I was like,
can we get rid of the apostrophe was 

787
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:30,170
young.

788
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:30,900
I was like 12.
And he was like,

789
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,990
huh.
And I was like,

790
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,610
it just sucks.
like why?

791
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,850
LIke,
what is it?

792
00:32:35,851 --> 00:32:37,230
Like people always mispronounce it and 
he's like,

793
00:32:37,231 --> 00:32:38,880
you should be proud of that.
And I was like,

794
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:44,110
I'm not.
And then I remember thinking I'm not,

795
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,990
it's just 13.
That's rough.

796
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,850
Yeah.
And then,

797
00:32:48,851 --> 00:32:50,990
and then,
and then I started to like it,

798
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:51,740
you know,
because I'm like,

799
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:52,730
yeah,
I guess it is my name.

800
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:53,450
Fuck it,
you know.

801
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:58,790
Um,
but when I was little I wanted to 

802
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:58,790
change.
I remember,

803
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,440
I remember asking my parents if I could.
I mean,

804
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:05,441
this is embarrassing.
I remember telling my parents that I 

805
00:33:06,231 --> 00:33:11,231
wanted to change my name to damien 
monroe.

806
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Yes.
You want to change your kristala to 

807
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,240
damien?
Damien,

808
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:20,800
the monroe.
Imagine.

809
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,070
Imagine if my name was damian.
We're enrolling.

810
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,470
You would have hated me immediately.
No,

811
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:26,880
I wouldn't.

812
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,200
I know.
Because you're open minded.

813
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,080
Yeah.
But feel von [inaudible] name ever.

814
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:34,850
My name is theodore theodore.
But think about it.

815
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,450
But think about.
This is why you didn't even know why,

816
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:42,510
why I wanted to do this,
because this is so embarrassing.

817
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,950
I'm whatever.
But because damien was is the devil,

818
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,920
right?
Okay.

819
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,000
And then Marilyn Monroe was pure in my 
head,

820
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,780
so I was like,
you have both this.

821
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,260
This was like a showbiz name id.
I don't know.

822
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,480
I didn't get very far with it.
Obviously this time.

823
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,030
Yeah,
same age.

824
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:02,300
Like young.
What am I was like,

825
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,450
well I could call.
My name is damien monroe.

826
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,360
Oh my god,
I would hate that.

827
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,010
Hilarious.
I mean,

828
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,690
you all do stupid things as a kid.
I didn't get to do that.

829
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:12,070
Obviously my parents would have let me 
do that.

830
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:16,090
Thank god I was a fucking weirdo man.
I would ask them my parents.

831
00:34:16,091 --> 00:34:21,091
I would,
I would ask my peers because I always 

832
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:21,091
sat like this at the dinner table and I 
asked them,

833
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:21,091
I was like,
I was like,

834
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:22,090
can you call me crazy legs?

835
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,800
And I remember thinking like,
oh,

836
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,880
that would be cool.
Like if my family called me crazy legs,

837
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,680
hey,
it's damien crazy legs.

838
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,070
And then they were like.
And my dad was like,

839
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:37,300
no.
And I was like,

840
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,700
but just like maybe just at least at the
dinner table,

841
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:42,010
I remember saying that.
And you will be like,

842
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:44,860
I'm not fucking calling you crazy.
Like you need to chris.

843
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,560
Oh my god.
That's so funny kid shit.

844
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,410
That was even younger.
the crazy legs thing was like,

845
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:52,390
it was probably like nine god.
Kids.

846
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,910
Ideas are so stupid.
They're so dumb.

847
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,650
They're so fucking funny.
I remember,

848
00:34:57,651 --> 00:35:02,651
uh,
these women laughing in my face once at 

849
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:03,840
me trying to be cool.
And I was like 12.

850
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,750
I had these fucking sneakers on.
I don't know,

851
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:15,751
like they were like these brown suede 
sneakers and I went through a period of 

852
00:35:15,751 --> 00:35:16,180
time.
This is very embarrassing.

853
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,480
And I went through a period of time when
I was like 12,

854
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:24,570
12,
13 inch where I got really into tom 

855
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,000
sawyer and huckleberry finn.
Oh boy.

856
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:31,050
I even tried chewing tobacco.
Oh geez.

857
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,210
They would tell you chewing tobacco when
you were a little kid.

858
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,800
You can be 12 inches bite.
Chewing tobacco for whatever reason.

859
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,620
That wasn't like cigarettes.
Right,

860
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,110
right,
right,

861
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:42,060
right.
you could just by chewing tobacco,

862
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:43,970
like I bought it.
I didn't have to hide.

863
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,020
That's so weird.
It's fucking crazy me let you.

864
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,200
But you would come in this wallet 
looking brick and you opened it up and 

865
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,870
you break a piece off like real old 
school.

866
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:57,630
Lee fucking clinics would style chewing 
tobacco.

867
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,910
I was retarded.
Okay.

868
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,160
So I had these,
these shoes on that were like a brown 

869
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,430
suede that were really goofy looking.
And these next door neighbors in this,

870
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,780
we rented a house.
It was me,

871
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,190
my sister,
my parents.

872
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:16,370
And then one of our friend's friend of 
my dad's rented one of the rooms in the 

873
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,781
house upstairs and the next door is like
a very small house and next door was 

874
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:22,650
another small house.
And these young kids lived there.

875
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:27,651
Like the downstairs people,
they had a band and they were fucking 

876
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:27,651
horrible.

877
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:29,550
But they were like super committed.
So they practice all the time.

878
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,930
And they had,
they had carpet everywhere man.

879
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:39,140
Like you'd go down in the basement and 
what they had done is taken like 30 or 

880
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,771
40 sheets of carpet and like made doors 
and pack the walls.

881
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,740
And they essentially turned the basement
into like a practice soundproof thing.

882
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,960
But you could,
you could hear them super clear and 

883
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,600
okay.
I remember they're,

884
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,510
the band's name was death in the 
shopping mall.

885
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:02,430
Oh my god.
And the song called my baby is a mutant.

886
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,510
You remember this?
Yeah,

887
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:04,020
yeah,
yeah.

888
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:07,790
I got a crazy memory man.
And so these guys like

889
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:12,890
the baby is.
But that's okay.

890
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,730
I love my baby.
It's crazy.

891
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,210
I can't even remember this shit.
Fucking practicing below in their ear.

892
00:37:23,211 --> 00:37:25,130
Jumped out there were cool as fuck 
though.

893
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,830
They let me go over there and watch when
I was 12,

894
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,690
let me go and hang out with these guys.
One of them scooped ice cream.

895
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:32,690
He a giant forums and everybody was 
like,

896
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:33,890
look at his forearms.
Managed scoops,

897
00:37:33,891 --> 00:37:35,750
Ice cream scoops,
ice cream all day.

898
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:40,751
So these jack forearm and all the young 
kids like 12 would be like scared of 

899
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:45,521
this 19 year old dude with his giant 
forums because he'd scooping all the 

900
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:45,740
time,
but they were all super friendly.

901
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:48,710
But there's these two freaky looking 
girls that would hang out with them.

902
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:49,360
And I,
you know,

903
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,350
when you're 12 years ago,
can you believe group?

904
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

905
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,860
So I have these stupid sneakers on.
I say the girl I go,

906
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,350
she goes nice sneakers,
like she's kind of mocking me.

907
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,010
I go,
yeah,

908
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:03,220
I don't like codes and my sneakers.
It turns me off and they burst into 

909
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,340
laughter.
Not laughing existence,

910
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,160
but like,
look at this fucking dork and I'll never

911
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:11,980
forget the feeling when I said it.
Like,

912
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,850
yeah,
I don't like colors in my sneakers.

913
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:15,860
It turns me off like the feeling of 
like,

914
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,040
oh,
you fucking moron.

915
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,060
You thought you were being cool and 
quickly while you were saying this and 

916
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,060
you're like,
oh,

917
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,060
this is not utilized.
That's hilarious.

918
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,490
I was 12.
I realized as you're saying like how 

919
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,250
stupid are you really get checked by the
opposite sex when you're that age.

920
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:33,270
I mean there was one time I kept like,
I remember heisey yeah,

921
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,140
I was probably still around.
I don't know,

922
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,040
but obviously I don't

923
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,320
drink it,
but there was great pets them.

924
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,780
Oh my god.
Wow.

925
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,730
Whoa.
They have a youtube video.

926
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,140
Definitely shopping malls.
This was a five year,

927
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,990
four years ago that these guys are 80.
Oh no,

928
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:59,820
it says that this was in 1981.
They recorded it and 81.

929
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:04,890
Wow.
So that was right around the same time 

930
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:08,400
because 81 was where I went to high 
school in 81,

931
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,440
so that would make sense.
That was like,

932
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,500
so I was.
I guess I was 13 and in a little later 

933
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:15,500
in the career,
but dude,

934
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,360
that's two years later.
We're talking about [inaudible] 79 in 

935
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,220
1979.
I'm pretty sure that was the age I was 

936
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:24,220
pretty crazy because I was 13.

937
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:31,230
Yeah,
because it was right when I first moved 

938
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:31,230
to boston.
We were living in Jamaica plain.

939
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:36,450
We were living on a god damn.
I don't remember the name of the street 

940
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,420
for remember the name of the street.
It would help,

941
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,330
but anyway,
I'll.

942
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,350
That haunted me.
Those girls laughing in my face.

943
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:43,970
Funny haunted me for years.
I still think about it.

944
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,580
It's interesting.
I think about.

945
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,660
I think about shit like that.
That's I think about shit like that that

946
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:54,050
like you carry with you like you know 
how sometimes it's just.

947
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,510
Yeah,
but sometimes it's just like that's.

948
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,280
I mean nothing it.
But what happened was you were too young

949
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,920
to have dealt with a situation like that
yet.

950
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,960
Yes.
So that was why you remember it,

951
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,980
because you're still,
oh,

952
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:07,390
this is new.
Oh god.

953
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:12,420
you know what I mean?
I was aware of personally aware of how 

954
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:12,580
we're stupid.

955
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,230
I sounded right.
Which,

956
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,230
but as a kid you don't have that.
Right.

957
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,420
You knoW.
So the first few times you,

958
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,910
you changed your name to damien monroe.
so were both forgiven.

959
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,910
I remember that I had to.
Yeah.

960
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,030
I feel like it was a different version 
of that.

961
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,380
I had,
I had a,

962
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,730
I see,
I was in kindergarten.

963
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,310
Yeah.
Kindergarten I think.

964
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,190
And um,
it was before first grade,

965
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:44,170
wherever that is,
kindergarten and I'm the high c straw.

966
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,260
It wAs great.
Paicey I remember and I squeezed it 

967
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,741
wrong and it shot up on my face and I 
was with a table where there were girls 

968
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:56,170
there and it was lunchtime.
And I remember thinking,

969
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,020
oh,
it's probably purple on my face,

970
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,900
around my eye,
like kiss or something.

971
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:04,010
Cool.
Yeah.

972
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,300
And,
and so I was like,

973
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:10,180
kisses cool.
Like I'm going to just chill with it.

974
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,940
And just because it happened by 
accident,

975
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:18,330
so it's not like I tried to do it so 
these chicks are just going to see me 

976
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,990
with this cool purple thing on my face.
I mean god,

977
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,770
I mean,
same age,

978
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,390
no kindergarten.
Oh,

979
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:30,391
so however old that jesus christ.
So youngest shit and thinking all these 

980
00:41:30,391 --> 00:41:32,590
thoughts and then thinking,
oh my god.

981
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,590
And then thinking,
ah,

982
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,780
I can't wait to like mac on these girls 
like young girls.

983
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:41,450
And I mean it was whatever.
But it was before first grade.

984
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,140
That's kindergarten.
Yeah.

985
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,030
Kindergarten,
yeah,

986
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,610
mrs antoine's.
And so say you got graPe soda.

987
00:41:47,611 --> 00:41:48,590
So I got great,
great.

988
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,690
Not even soda juice,
you know what I mean,

989
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:51,770
on your face.
And um,

990
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:57,490
I remember thinking like I remember 
leaving it there and it was very sticky 

991
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,330
because it's high c and it's candidate 
basically.

992
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,440
So.
And was,

993
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,260
I believe it though because it's cool.
I remember thinking like,

994
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,310
just stick with it because it's very 
cool.

995
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,520
And finally it was so sticky that I was 
like,

996
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,630
I hope that this is like paying off 
because I got to wipe my face.

997
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,100
And so I asked the girl like really 
insecurely,

998
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:14,990
like next to me,
I Was like,

999
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:15,890
hey,
uh,

1000
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,600
I was like,
is it like all purple on my face,

1001
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,550
but like wanting it to be purple,
you know?

1002
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,640
And she goes and she just goes like 
this.

1003
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:23,540
No.

1004
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,140
And then I was like,
can I go to the bathroom?

1005
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:29,570
And I washed my face,
like what in the bathroom?

1006
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,000
And then I looked at my face.
It was just my face,

1007
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,740
zero purple.
But,

1008
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:38,790
but that was like an,
those were actual thoughts that this 

1009
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,630
idiotic fucking kindergarten or had I 
was like,

1010
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:46,631
oh,
I look like a rockstar is what I 

1011
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:47,741
thought.
This moments you can remember when 

1012
00:42:47,741 --> 00:42:48,440
you're just a little kid where you're so
fucking stupid,

1013
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:51,320
they will haunt you deep.
think about that all the time.

1014
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:55,190
I think about all the time it's probably
shaped me,

1015
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,120
you know,
it definitely has like one ass kicking 

1016
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,260
in highschool could turn you one way or 
the next left or right.

1017
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:09,030
Like people have been,
some people have been bullied in high 

1018
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,030
school and it fucked him up for the rest
of their life.

1019
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,760
Well yeah,
they a lot.

1020
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,370
Yeah,
I mean and even before high school,

1021
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:13,760
like junior high in grammar school and 
shit,

1022
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,710
some people just never recovered from 
it.

1023
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:21,190
So weird inclination that people have 
bullies in schools like to find one kid 

1024
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:25,040
who fucking nervous and start fucking 
with them.

1025
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,450
YeAh.
That's very normal to me.

1026
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,190
Where you going after school?
Nelson?

1027
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:30,380
Besides sucking my dick in the woods.

1028
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:38,150
I never understood that big giant gay 
dude wants you to suck his dick in the 

1029
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:41,090
world.
You got to go to high school with him,

1030
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,100
fight him off every day.
Parents don't believe you.

1031
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,150
Yeah,
I mean I,

1032
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,710
I loved always making fun of people but 
not bullying.

1033
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,090
Yeah,
no.

1034
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,380
Well I think there's a lot of kids who 
get physically abused at home.

1035
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:59,410
Yeah,
I think that's a Big fan and they get 

1036
00:43:59,410 --> 00:43:59,410
their power back.
Yeah.

1037
00:43:59,410 --> 00:43:59,600
And then there's physical bullying that 
way,

1038
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:04,601
but then the psychological bullying too,
and then there's a certain amount of 

1039
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,020
natural pecking order shit that kids do 
to each other.

1040
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:11,210
They're competitive with each other and 
one will say something shitty and the 

1041
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,380
next will say something shitty back and 
then they form teams,

1042
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:13,670
cruz,
chris,

1043
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,530
piece of shit.
Right.

1044
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,010
You know,
and then you're like,

1045
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:18,110
you know what man,
mike and I were just fucking.

1046
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:22,250
You guys get to pick a team going team 
chris for Mike Lyons,

1047
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:23,390
bro.
Yeah.

1048
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:28,391
there's a lot of animal behavior.
Like I have chickens and one of my 

1049
00:44:28,391 --> 00:44:28,400
chickens,
like one of them,

1050
00:44:28,401 --> 00:44:33,401
something goes wrong,
like the other ones start fucking with 

1051
00:44:33,401 --> 00:44:33,401
it.
They peck at it.

1052
00:44:33,401 --> 00:44:33,401
Really?
Yeah.

1053
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,100
Yeah.
It's weird.

1054
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,830
You know,
I don't eat the chicken.

1055
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,730
Just eat their eggs,
which are non fertilized.

1056
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,180
Ladies and gentlemen.
All you crazy vegans out there.

1057
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:47,520
Not getting enough protein in the eggs 
from chickens.

1058
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,170
Throw your pets.
They're going to run around.

1059
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,960
You can even if you want to,
you feed them vegetarian diets,

1060
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,040
which you really shouldn't because 
they're not vegetarian is little fucking

1061
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:01,100
dinosaurs bro.
But the thing is when they see like 

1062
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:01,100
something wrong with one of the other 
ones,

1063
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,400
it's a real problem.
One of them gets injured,

1064
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,560
the other ones start pecking at it.
Weird.

1065
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:09,650
Yeah,
iT makes you think that that's how we 

1066
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:09,650
are secretively.
Well,

1067
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:09,660
I think at our base level,
no,

1068
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:14,870
but I think what is so like one,
it's interesting about all these anti 

1069
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:18,381
bullying campaigns is that they didn't 
exist when we were younger and whether 

1070
00:45:18,381 --> 00:45:21,890
or not you make an argument for people 
figuring out how to get along through 

1071
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,280
the natural methods that we've 
encountered,

1072
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:27,090
like finding good people and bad people 
and finding who you like and finding out

1073
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,340
about your own behavior and how it 
affects other people.

1074
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:32,070
Either way it's a w,
w,

1075
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,680
w.
What I think's going on is we don't want

1076
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:39,681
people to fuck with people anymore and I
think in the old days everybody just 

1077
00:45:39,681 --> 00:45:44,331
accepted that people fucked up people 
and now we realized we're going older 

1078
00:45:44,331 --> 00:45:48,321
were really.
But what's crazy is that we're figuring 

1079
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:48,480
this out as a culture in the last 20,
30,

1080
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:51,990
whatever the fuck years it's been human 
beings have been around now for.

1081
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,940
But it's,
it's,

1082
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,470
it's social media though.
That's what it is because now everything

1083
00:45:55,471 --> 00:45:57,180
is exposed.
It is thAt.

1084
00:45:57,181 --> 00:46:02,181
But I think it was on its way there just
through traditional methods like books 

1085
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,340
and regular media and colleges and 
universities.

1086
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:10,610
That's one of the reasons why college 
and universities are so important for 

1087
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:13,401
changing thought,
especially were there kind of in a 

1088
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:16,101
fucked up place now,
but there was a thing where you would 

1089
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:17,520
leave your environment and go to this 
new environment,

1090
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:21,520
right in this new environment would be 
filled with intellectual,

1091
00:46:21,521 --> 00:46:22,850
right,
filled with people,

1092
00:46:22,851 --> 00:46:27,851
they're trying to change the world and 
you'd be exposed to ideas you never got 

1093
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,741
before and so through those ideas,
then you learn about your shit and then 

1094
00:46:30,741 --> 00:46:34,731
you'd go out with this idea that you're 
going to go do this or you're going to 

1095
00:46:34,731 --> 00:46:37,401
go apply your knowledge now there,
or get a degree here and everything 

1096
00:46:37,401 --> 00:46:41,751
would sort of compound in your 
understanding of the world would be far 

1097
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:41,751
better than the people that came before 
you.

1098
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:44,760
Because just the fact that humanity's 
accumulated 20,

1099
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:48,060
30 plus years of information since the 
time your parents were in school.

1100
00:46:48,061 --> 00:46:48,570
Right?
Right.

1101
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,540
so all that aside,
as that goes by,

1102
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:56,541
that gets you a certain way.
It gets you a certain amount of steps 

1103
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,410
past the barbarians and the fucking 
romans,

1104
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:02,820
all the psychopaths of our history,
but now once social media kicks in,

1105
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:07,970
now everything's accelerated in a way.
We can't even control completely out 

1106
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:12,030
everybody's hands.
that's why trigger words and safe spaces

1107
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:15,870
and everyone's going fucking crazy.
It's too fast for us to catch up with,

1108
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,450
you know,
but it's moving in the right direction.

1109
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:21,630
like even all the ridiculous like 
trigger word safe space and stuff.

1110
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:25,410
All that stuff is like,
it's in thE inclination is to be nicer.

1111
00:47:25,411 --> 00:47:27,000
Yeah,
that's a good thing for sure.

1112
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:28,710
Yeah.
So some of it's ridiculous.

1113
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,860
It's not well thought out,
like you're better off having people 

1114
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,450
communicate and having safe spaces.

1115
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,450
You better off figuring out a way to 
bake people just not shitty to each 

1116
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:39,450
other and screaming and yelling at each 
other,

1117
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:41,490
like find a better method of 
communicating now.

1118
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,320
But uh,
the point is,

1119
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,210
it's like they're moving in that 
direction.

1120
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:47,590
They're moving in a really good 
direction.

1121
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:52,591
Even these ridiculous like liberals at 
shut down that evergreen college and 

1122
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:56,041
they're going nuts and they didn't want 
white people to show up for work for a 

1123
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:57,160
day.
Their inclination is probably correct.

1124
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:59,920
I just want to balance things out and 
when things are right now,

1125
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:04,921
they feel like black people are still 
like in a bad position as far as like 

1126
00:48:04,921 --> 00:48:08,571
racial injustice and by pushing white 
people down they're going to bounce a 

1127
00:48:08,571 --> 00:48:10,330
black people out,
but they just don't understand humans.

1128
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,380
Right.
It just doesn't.

1129
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:12,610
It doesn't work.
Like that works.

1130
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,720
You know what?
We're breaking it down crystal.

1131
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,200
I know man on fire.
Is it hard picking a name

1132
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,100
for your special or this one?
It was not because you have a bit.

1133
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:23,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

1134
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,590
But uh,
yeah,

1135
00:48:25,591 --> 00:48:26,760
I find it difficult.
Yeah,

1136
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,050
they do.
Yeah.

1137
00:48:28,051 --> 00:48:30,240
I was actually before yours came out,
I was like,

1138
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:35,241
man,
somebody should do like trigger warning 

1139
00:48:35,241 --> 00:48:35,241
or something.
Yeah.

1140
00:48:35,241 --> 00:48:37,671
I jUst did a great title.
I did it because I knew what they were 

1141
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:37,671
upset some people,
but that's.

1142
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:38,340
But that's.
But that's who you are though.

1143
00:48:38,341 --> 00:48:39,570
And that's what that.
I mean,

1144
00:48:39,571 --> 00:48:42,940
you talk about all the things that would
trigger somebody well,

1145
00:48:42,941 --> 00:48:47,070
like just talk about what's ridiculous 
about those things and with that special

1146
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,050
particularly I knew like the bruce 
jenner bit,

1147
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,000
I'm like,
oh this is,

1148
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,240
this one's coming home heart is it?
They need a trigger warning.

1149
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:56,880
I don't even know.
I'm a physical comedian.

1150
00:48:56,881 --> 00:49:00,300
I don't even know how you made that fit 
work chair and all that shit.

1151
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:01,660
No,
but I mean not even just that,

1152
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:02,480
the,
the,

1153
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,430
the,
the build and everything.

1154
00:49:05,431 --> 00:49:08,390
It was just like he became a bunch of 
different things.

1155
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,190
Like it started out,
it started out a little different.

1156
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:16,191
It started out,
it was a little more calm and then I 

1157
00:49:16,191 --> 00:49:16,191
realized like,
you know,

1158
00:49:16,191 --> 00:49:18,840
the only way this is gonna work,
like worth people gonna really think I'm

1159
00:49:18,841 --> 00:49:23,010
a demon because I try to think this is a
fucking goofy thing to admit,

1160
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:28,250
but when I'm doing that bit,
I used to do this bit about tigers 

1161
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,611
fucking.
And one of the key that I figured out 

1162
00:49:31,611 --> 00:49:33,441
the key to the bit.
At one point the key to the bit was to 

1163
00:49:33,441 --> 00:49:33,720
think like a tiger and to move like a 
tie.

1164
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:38,780
Not think of myself as a comedian.
When I did that bit I was thinking of 

1165
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,960
myself as a demon.
Like I was thinking of myself as a card.

1166
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,330
It kicks off.
So then my inclination was to just climb

1167
00:49:45,331 --> 00:49:50,331
on the stool and just like in getting 
this weird sort of gollum hunched over 

1168
00:49:50,431 --> 00:49:55,431
stance because.
And plus I figured because I'm really 

1169
00:49:55,431 --> 00:49:55,431
flexible,
it'll look weird.

1170
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,600
strange,
you know,

1171
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,640
that's funny.
My son was,

1172
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:04,650
my opener is like,
how do you do like to act out like that 

1173
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:06,771
and I'm just like,
you just believed that that's what you 

1174
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:06,771
are for a little.
But

1175
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:07,000
it's so dumb.
But.

1176
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,210
But if you could do it,
if you could pull it off,

1177
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:16,650
you know,
you ever see jimmy schubert's bit about 

1178
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:16,650
eagles meeting?
No,

1179
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,890
it's a hilarious bit.
But when schubert's doing it,

1180
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:23,891
it's becAuse eagles have this crazy 
thing where they fuck while they're 

1181
00:50:23,891 --> 00:50:24,410
flying.
When they fuck,

1182
00:50:24,411 --> 00:50:28,100
they stay connected untiL to come.
So like they don't make it.

1183
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:29,900
They fucking crashed into the ground and
die.

1184
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,050
Which is hilarious,
but his bit,

1185
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,970
you know,
he's like got like while he's doing it,

1186
00:50:37,971 --> 00:50:41,090
even though you know what you're 
thinking about,

1187
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,730
thinking like an eagle.
It's funny.

1188
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,290
He's,
he's an eagle right now.

1189
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,830
He's in his.
He's in his element.

1190
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,540
That's funny.
It's have a truck back now,

1191
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,320
that's for sure.
Not too loud,

1192
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:54,840
right?
I mean that's so core and doors.

1193
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:02,530
We're nowhere near that truck because 
they say you get your money pages back 

1194
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:02,530
up,
bro.

1195
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,790
Yeah.
Not everything has to be white,

1196
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:05,680
white,
white,

1197
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,960
white,
white sox.

1198
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,560
Someone new sneakers every day.
The sun,

1199
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,550
the wrapper.
I saw a rapper the yesterday,

1200
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:17,180
got a papa smurf,
a diamond encrusted chain man.

1201
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:22,330
They're just trying to outdo each other.
You know what I've been thinking to 

1202
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,200
doing.
I've been thinking of live in two 

1203
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,141
separate ways.
Thing going to get into a cabin in the 

1204
00:51:26,141 --> 00:51:26,141
woods,
right where I live.

1205
00:51:26,141 --> 00:51:29,570
Like I have a well solar power.
Just chill out there for half the year.

1206
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:34,690
The other half of the year I get the 
dopest house I can afford in beverly 

1207
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:35,450
hills.
Just walk around and furs everywhere.

1208
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:40,190
I like how it might be a lineman.
So you glasses outside at night?

1209
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:41,110
Always.
Yeah.

1210
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,100
That's great.
Yeah.

1211
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,470
So you have to.
You're your one half year.

1212
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,730
You give the other a limo with my face 
on it.

1213
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,900
You make the driver wear a mask of you.
I'm going to get a a grill that I could 

1214
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,990
only put on for six months,
a year.

1215
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:59,890
So after six months they take the grill 
off and then I go back to being the 

1216
00:51:59,890 --> 00:51:59,890
woods guy.

1217
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:05,570
Board being one person.
I think you know,

1218
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,370
I mean to that.
Well,

1219
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:08,030
yeah,
because look,

1220
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:13,031
tupac had the songs about how lyft are 
women up and then he would be the other 

1221
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:13,031
guy.
Be like,

1222
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:13,980
fuck bitches too.
Yeah,

1223
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,320
it's very confused.
Figured it out.

1224
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:20,590
Yeah.
Well he was a poet and also he was a 

1225
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:23,231
reporter.
He was reporting on what's going on in 

1226
00:52:23,231 --> 00:52:23,231
the streets.
Are you not?

1227
00:52:23,231 --> 00:52:23,231
No,
no.

1228
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:28,900
Bipolar.
I just want to do it for six months out 

1229
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,740
of the Year.
he's just fun outside of the.

1230
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,240
Oh this is what I'll do.
I'll get a crib in downtown la,

1231
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:34,730
like one of them penthouse cribs.
We're overlooking the city.

1232
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,710
Yeah.
What a pool on the deck.

1233
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,590
Would your family be with you both 
times?

1234
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,720
Fuck you talking about bro.
One of the half of the year.

1235
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:42,890
No,
I'm a different dude,

1236
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:47,230
but I'm a different dude.

1237
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,200
Okay.
I got it.

1238
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,730
Yeah.
I don't even have a family anymore.

1239
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:54,800
Let me look.
I saw a video of a guy where they were.

1240
00:52:54,801 --> 00:52:59,240
This guy said he was a trans age.
He was a young girl.

1241
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:01,970
He was like,
he identified with being a young girl.

1242
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:07,630
He was like a 50 something year old man 
and the identify with being a young 

1243
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:10,631
girl.
He has children and they let this guy 

1244
00:53:10,631 --> 00:53:10,631
dressed up like a young girl and people 
are accepting it.

1245
00:53:10,631 --> 00:53:12,170
It's family's accepting it.
He was talking to people.

1246
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:17,171
He's saying how he really feels.
What's to stop you from being a totally 

1247
00:53:17,171 --> 00:53:19,670
different person.
I get it to identify as like a korean.

1248
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:24,080
Just identify as a different guy.
Like right now you identify as kristala.

1249
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,960
Yeah.
I'm wondering now

1250
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,050
host out of the character.
What's damien?

1251
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:29,270
What damien?
Yeah.

1252
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,720
Dude,
was I ahead of my time.

1253
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,670
You might've been ahead of your time.
This is what I'm thinking.

1254
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:35,520
You could be this as the guy trans woman
lives her life as a six year old.

1255
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,380
Yeah.
Has a family.

1256
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:40,270
Has children at someone's daddy.
She decided.

1257
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,700
What is the girl that he thinks he's so.
What was he doing for six years ago?

1258
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,250
It's still the guy six years ago.
He hadn't been born yet,

1259
00:53:47,251 --> 00:53:47,970
bro.
So can he.

1260
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,820
Does he ever.
Was he ever turned seven?

1261
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:51,310
No.
No,

1262
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:51,750
no,
no.

1263
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:56,751
And there's always.
This identifies age is irrelevant dude.

1264
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,880
Okay.
You can't age someone just like you 

1265
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,080
can't gender someone a piece of shit.
Shit right now.

1266
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,020
I am.
God.

1267
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,870
That's him as a woman.
But what am I going to get one day?

1268
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:10,580
A incorrect.
He will forever called it.

1269
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:16,970
So there was,
he had a gang of kids and then fell on 

1270
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:16,970
his head or something.
What?

1271
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,360
What caused it?
I dunno.

1272
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,190
Maybe just decided.
Well,

1273
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:22,110
so what's.
If you can do that,

1274
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,330
you can do that.
That's who you identify with.

1275
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:25,050
Now.
You're a girl.

1276
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:26,970
You could change your name.
You can change your name,

1277
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,410
your becky.
Now I'm becky.

1278
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,120
I'm caitlin,
I want you to be.

1279
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:31,320
I'll be nine said,
well,

1280
00:54:31,321 --> 00:54:33,720
I don't mind going to six,
so I've been six ever since.

1281
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,780
Well,
whoa.

1282
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,420
Wow.
I don't know what to make of that.

1283
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:47,340
Jesus christ.
Listen to this nonsense.

1284
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:53,290
Well,
I have a mummy and daddy and adopted 

1285
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,911
mommy and a daddy who are totally 
comfortable with me being a little girl 

1286
00:54:55,911 --> 00:54:59,280
and their children and their 
grandchildren are totally supportive.

1287
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:02,280
In fact,
her youngest granddaughter,

1288
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,770
when I was eight a year ago,
she was eight,

1289
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:06,930
so she's getting older.
When I waS eight a year ago,

1290
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:09,390
I was eight and she was seven and she 
said to me,

1291
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:13,040
I want you to be the little sister so 
I'll be nice.

1292
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:13,980
Oh wow.
I said,

1293
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:15,930
well,
I don't mind going to six,

1294
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,180
so I've been six ever since.
Well,

1295
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:23,181
so now he's just changing it though we 
are living in a world of nonsense.

1296
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:30,170
I mean,
you can't just change it so that he 

1297
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:30,170
doesn't identify with it if he just 
keeps changing it.

1298
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,260
I'm not even going to have real diamonds
on my grill.

1299
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:32,760
I'm going to tell everybody they're 
real,

1300
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:37,970
but they're going to be cubic zirconias 
because food's going to get caught in 

1301
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:37,970
man,
who gives a shit.

1302
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:41,130
It doesn't have to be real like they 
identify as real diamond platinum on the

1303
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:42,570
outside though,
for sure.

1304
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,610
Wow.
For sure.

1305
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:48,630
Platinum and then I'd get it taken off 
every six months and I become a words 

1306
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:48,630
guy.
What's guy?

1307
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:49,770
Yeah,
I'm into it,

1308
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:51,420
man.
I'll vouch for you.

1309
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:51,790
I'd be like,
no,

1310
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:56,791
he sTill people did.
You keep telling me you can't be a 

1311
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:57,060
different person.
You could totally be a different person.

1312
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:59,610
You feel different a lot during the day.
You feel like one way.

1313
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:03,150
Some morning you're sad and then at 
night you're like,

1314
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,260
oh,
thIs is a great life.

1315
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:06,390
You know?
Remember that bIttersweet symphony song.

1316
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,050
A million different people from one day 
to the next bit.

1317
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,320
Probably symphony this.
Remember that.

1318
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,210
Not the way you're saying it,
but maybe.

1319
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:24,730
But there was a band called the verve 
and it was a great song.

1320
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,410
I know.
Yes,

1321
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,120
I know the song,
the verb,

1322
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:30,400
but they lost all the money because the 
opening riff,

1323
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:35,020
santa just stones.
Remember that I heard something recently

1324
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,400
similar to this.
Did you know that?

1325
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:38,140
Uh,
that song I'll be missing you.

1326
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:43,141
That puff daddy mad about that has made 
all of the money from that song.

1327
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,440
Yeah.
Every breath you take $166.

1328
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,380
Million dollars or something like that.
How much?

1329
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,120
Like 60 or $70?
Million dollars.

1330
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,670
Just that one song that doesn't share 
with the police.

1331
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:56,671
It's just his money,
but also the police see that's way 

1332
00:56:56,671 --> 00:56:56,770
fucked up the police.
But he wasn't,

1333
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,460
it wasn't stinging the on the edge.
No,

1334
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:01,960
dude,
you can't be the edge.

1335
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,000
That's what youtube,
right?

1336
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:05,530
Youtube is good.
The edge.

1337
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:06,940
What's the edge,
bro?

1338
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,430
What's that band?
One of the guys in the band.

1339
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,380
But he calls himself that he's a white 
guy.

1340
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,990
He's a whiTe guy and he calls himself 
the edge.

1341
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:15,620
Hey.
No,

1342
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,140
definitely.
No.

1343
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,110
Yeah,
don't be a thing.

1344
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:22,270
I just love.
I just love when rappers are like,

1345
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:24,370
that's why they call me fucking the 
edge.

1346
00:57:24,371 --> 00:57:26,620
And you're like,
you asked people to call you that dude.

1347
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,470
That's why people call you that.
You can't do that.

1348
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,900
They call me the love professor.
No,

1349
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,400
no they don't.
They call me.

1350
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,890
When you say they call me,
I stopped listening.

1351
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:41,010
Yeah,
they call me the psychological 

1352
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:41,010
coordinator.
That's a good one.

1353
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:44,020
That could be one of your guys.
Guy psychological coordinator.

1354
00:57:44,021 --> 00:57:47,920
I just sit and write books on people.
This is what I think of a few of them on

1355
00:57:47,921 --> 00:57:49,560
television.
Yeah.

1356
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:52,930
I mean why can't you be a different 
person if you can identify as being just

1357
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:54,640
decided I'm nine or I'm six.

1358
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,790
Did you see the one about the guy who 
identifies as an alien or.

1359
00:57:57,791 --> 00:58:01,990
No,
he wants to have his because he wants to

1360
00:58:01,991 --> 00:58:02,830
be an.
Well,

1361
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:06,070
he's done his whole body.
He's a ton of money.

1362
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:09,310
Is he not allowed to say he?
Can we say z,

1363
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,560
z,
z.

1364
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:16,560
Z has spent a ton of money,
has fake lips and done some petty shit 

1365
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:21,520
to z xyz.
That's $50,000

1366
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:23,410
at over a 100 procedures.
First of all,

1367
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,780
stop.
Stop right there.

1368
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:31,500
That's not true because that means each 
procedure is how much you've done 100 

1369
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:35,680
procedures.
50 divided by 100 or 50,000

1370
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:37,000
divided by 100.
How cheaper?

1371
00:58:37,001 --> 00:58:38,920
These fucking procedures.
$14 each.

1372
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,510
Yeah.
This is ridiculous.

1373
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:44,890
100 procedures will go down as the 
seizure is a thousand dollars.

1374
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:49,930
It would be $100,000.
So you've done 100 procedures at $100 

1375
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,310
each.
Five for one dude.

1376
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:55,240
That plastic surgery is fucking 
expensive.

1377
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,860
That's one of those things.
It's like a burger.

1378
00:58:56,861 --> 00:58:58,540
You want to pay the most?
Yeah.

1379
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:01,570
Yeah.
I mean unless he's got a friend,

1380
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,420
it's hundred.
Just $100,000

1381
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,940
or $50,000
on a ledge right there.

1382
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,390
That's from taking so much dick that 
your,

1383
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,400
your,
your cave caves in.

1384
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:18,330
But,
but he's slick when they drilled for 

1385
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:20,650
cold,
they don't do the proper seismics 

1386
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:20,650
studies.
So he doesn't have a uh,

1387
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:21,500
uh,
exactly.

1388
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:22,300
Jina aura.

1389
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,130
A peanut or she's an alien.
Whatever is.

1390
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:30,170
He's an alien that's.
She's trying to become a genderless 

1391
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,610
alien.
It's an interesting look.

1392
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,180
I mean why not man,
you know,

1393
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,170
people want to get their face tattooed.
Why not get wacky and do this?

1394
00:59:36,171 --> 00:59:38,690
And who the fuck am I to judge?
My arms are covered in tattoos.

1395
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,120
No,
I mean it fucking.

1396
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:45,170
If it makes the person happy or the 
alien who got art all over my arms,

1397
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:46,880
but keep that picture up,
man.

1398
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:48,440
What you doing?
you want to keep it to yourself.

1399
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:49,290
By the way,
do you.

1400
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:52,010
Do you.
let me see the top one.

1401
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,940
The top one with the face one is the 
weird face one.

1402
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:56,890
No,
no,

1403
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,640
no.
The one like the top.

1404
00:59:58,641 --> 01:00:00,530
Top one.
That one is fucking trippy.

1405
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,990
What was he doing?
What is he doing?

1406
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,070
Twosies eyes.
Well,

1407
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:06,770
vinny is makeup artist vinny.

1408
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,420
Oh,
22 from los angeles,

1409
01:00:08,421 --> 01:00:13,421
California.
It has plans costing over $160,000

1410
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:17,330
to become genderless alien.
He's already spent $50,000.

1411
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,550
those were probably 10 photos.
Yeah.

1412
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,440
Jesus raise.
Is that the other's contacts?

1413
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,160
Contacts.
Oh,

1414
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,330
those are the contacts,
but it might also be.

1415
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,110
Oh,
he looked kind of normalish,

1416
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,750
right?
That that is normal.

1417
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:37,751
Osha.
What kind of pain you have to be in to 

1418
01:00:37,751 --> 01:00:38,720
want to be genderless,
genderless alien.

1419
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:42,290
Who,
but who am I to judge?

1420
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:48,100
Who is anybody to judge kristala?
Wouldn't this world be better if we 

1421
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:48,100
didn't?
A judge.

1422
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,190
We didn't exist.
You and I wouldn't exist.

1423
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:51,640
We wouldn't have a job.
It's a problem.

1424
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:53,420
That's like that brethrens joke when he 
was like,

1425
01:00:53,421 --> 01:00:55,970
who could only god can judge me.
He's like,

1426
01:00:55,971 --> 01:01:00,971
no,
a judge can judge you because funny 

1427
01:01:00,971 --> 01:01:00,971
joke.
thank god he does.

1428
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:09,200
Stupid tattooed on shit.
You're right,

1429
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,710
judge can judge god dammit.
I know you fucked up.

1430
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:14,140
That's why.
by the way,

1431
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:16,370
I'm like,
before I get this done,

1432
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,450
is there anybody else who could judge 
me?

1433
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,480
Put me.
hey bro.

1434
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,890
Nobody can judge you.
But god,

1435
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:26,440
nobody.
Nobody judges and occupation.

1436
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,210
Um,
what it is.

1437
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:32,590
Did you know that a chiropractor is not 
even at,

1438
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:37,760
did you?
I,

1439
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,630
I love tattoos.
I always wanted to get that to us.

1440
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:41,570
But like I just don't be scared of.
Well,

1441
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,220
it's just,
what if I don't like it late.

1442
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:44,900
Exactly right.
ThAt's the fear with it.

1443
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,720
So let's go to a good tattoo artist.
Yeah.

1444
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:49,490
But what if I'm like,
oh,

1445
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:51,980
I love what I got super lucky.
The guy who did amaze,

1446
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:56,981
a gentleman named aaron dasilva dova 
from guru tattoo in san diego and he's a

1447
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,450
world renowned tattoo artists.

1448
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,210
Does the style of tattoo that I like,
like big,

1449
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,220
bold,
lots of colors and stuff.

1450
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,050
He's just.
I got lucky that I got.

1451
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,960
It took a long time now I had to get,
I got to wait and get an appointment and

1452
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:14,350
this one took like,
I don't want to say this one took like 

1453
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:14,930
50 hours.
This one took like 40.

1454
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:16,430
So you got that done.
Done.

1455
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:20,250
You got that all done in pieces and 
pieces,

1456
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,670
but eight hours.
then I come back again and they would do

1457
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:26,040
like one part for eight hours.
I understand that.

1458
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:28,530
But you,
that whole thing was a design.

1459
01:02:28,531 --> 01:02:29,560
It wasn't like.
Oh wow.

1460
01:02:29,561 --> 01:02:30,220
Actually.
Yeah,

1461
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:32,010
because usually a lot of people just add
to it.

1462
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,300
Started small,
right?

1463
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:35,100
I had this little idea and he was like,
yeah,

1464
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:38,490
it's like you have too much shit you're 
trying to do in this one little thing.

1465
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,080
I was like,
hm,

1466
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:42,330
so what should I go like half sleeve?
He's like,

1467
01:02:42,331 --> 01:02:43,980
well,
it's make your dry up a half sleeve,

1468
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:45,600
and then I'm like,
fuck it.

1469
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:50,660
Let's just go all the way in.
So all of a sudden then you were 

1470
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:50,660
tattooed?
Yeah.

1471
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,850
All of a sudden,
well took no more than a year,

1472
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,200
but it seemed like when people like sort
of piece them together like one little 

1473
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,010
tattoo at the time,
there's something about big pieces,

1474
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,520
like when someone has a big flowing 
piece,

1475
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:06,000
like if you're going to get something 
done,

1476
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,200
it's all personal choice and like,
um,

1477
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:10,570
you just have your arms.
Yeah.

1478
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,700
Yeah.
I like them.

1479
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:13,680
They don't bother me.
I always think they look cool.

1480
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:14,220
Like,
you know,

1481
01:03:14,221 --> 01:03:16,140
even conor mcgregor and shit like that 
looks cool.

1482
01:03:16,141 --> 01:03:19,080
He's got and wacky carrillo on his neck,
on his neck,

1483
01:03:19,081 --> 01:03:20,610
you know,
girl with a crown.

1484
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,020
But it's like cool.
It's him.

1485
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:27,080
You know what I mean?
Are you going to pay money to see that 

1486
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:27,080
fight?
I got,

1487
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:27,080
I,
I got to see that.

1488
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,170
I mean,
I don't really follow it too much,

1489
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,880
but I got to see that.
Right,

1490
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:30,990
right.
Yeah.

1491
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,490
I wouldn't see.
I would say yeah,

1492
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,100
I would definitely watch it.
I'm working that night.

1493
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:37,680
I'm trying to figure out how I'm going 
to avoid finding out about the.

1494
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:39,030
Yeah,
let's take your chicken.

1495
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:39,630
Watch it.
Yeah.

1496
01:03:39,631 --> 01:03:41,490
I mean there's no.
I'm in.

1497
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:46,600
I'm in dc that night,
so I got to figure out how I can watch 

1498
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,340
it without finding out what happened,
if that's is a possible way.

1499
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:52,140
But what about,
what do you think you do?

1500
01:03:52,141 --> 01:03:54,870
You have an idea what's going to happen?
I think floyd mayweather.

1501
01:03:54,871 --> 01:03:57,090
It was going to win a boxing match.
That's what I think.

1502
01:03:57,110 --> 01:04:02,110
It's like how he's going to win and 
whether or not he's he's challenged and 

1503
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:03,750
whether or not he's put in danger.
He could be put in danger for sure.

1504
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:09,200
If connor puts,
connor's got to put himself in danger 

1505
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,830
and he's got to be confident enough to 
like he's got to get ahold of them.

1506
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:15,890
I think he's got a rough him up and he's
definitely not going to win a straight 

1507
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,400
boxing match against the best boxer 
ever.

1508
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,910
Right.
and uh,

1509
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,580
I don't think he thinks he would do that
either.

1510
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:25,581
I think what he wants to do is clip him 
just like go after him making big sprint

1511
01:04:25,831 --> 01:04:27,300
right away.
Try to clip.

1512
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:29,610
I'm trying to hurt him.
Try to rough him up.

1513
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:34,950
The more time goes on.
What happens with a guy like floyd is he

1514
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:37,250
starts,
I mean he's been boxing for so long,

1515
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,660
he starts doing things.

1516
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,220
Then anticipating your reaction to those
things.

1517
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,190
Timing,
yeah,

1518
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,700
she'll do things not even so that he 
could hit you,

1519
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:49,850
but to see how you react and how fast 
you are and maybe if he did this and 

1520
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:54,681
then came over the top or maybe he did 
this and stepped over here and hit you 

1521
01:04:54,681 --> 01:04:58,221
with a left hook and he gets it in his 
head and he starts moving around and he 

1522
01:04:58,221 --> 01:05:01,200
puts you in like he sort of has these 
parameters for your movements.

1523
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:04,770
Almost like he's a super computer.
You'd see like anderson silva used to do

1524
01:05:04,771 --> 01:05:07,470
that too.
You could see him like measured timing.

1525
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:12,650
He would see how you react that he would
just drop that front kick on your face 

1526
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:16,731
or something like that.
He just sees that there's an opening 

1527
01:05:16,731 --> 01:05:19,311
there.
He knows how fast he can execute a 

1528
01:05:19,311 --> 01:05:21,321
technique.
He how fast after watching a move for a 

1529
01:05:21,321 --> 01:05:21,790
while that you can move and he knows 
whether or not you can get them.

1530
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,590
Whether you can get to her like how 
fast.

1531
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:28,591
All right,
so once floyd has those numbers in his 

1532
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:29,050
head,
then you just get your face boxed off,

1533
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:34,890
then you get your face.
It's interesting that a guy can be so 

1534
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:35,850
good at that and,
and,

1535
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
and work so hard and not get brutally 
ruined it to the point to become a and 

1536
01:05:43,901 --> 01:05:45,460
then become a champion.
You know what I mean?

1537
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,350
there's a bunch of faculty,
the training and shit.

1538
01:05:47,351 --> 01:05:50,230
I mean obviously guys get hurt and then 
can become a true champion.

1539
01:05:50,231 --> 01:05:55,231
Yeah.
To be that guy that's gotten to that 

1540
01:05:55,231 --> 01:05:55,231
point.
It's just amazing.

1541
01:05:55,231 --> 01:05:55,600
Floyd's got a bunch of factors on the 
side.

1542
01:05:55,930 --> 01:06:00,930
One,
his uncle is a fantastic former 

1543
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:01,600
professional boxer.
Roger may,

1544
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:03,940
whether the black mamba corner guy,
he was a world champIon.

1545
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:07,120
He was a bad motherfucker and he would 
start guys with one punch,

1546
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,950
but he had a totally different style.

1547
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,400
And then his dad,
floyd made with their senior phot sugar 

1548
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,880
ray leonard and had a really good fight 
against sugar ray leonard,

1549
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,400
if I want to remember,
he was stopped,

1550
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,620
laid in the fight.
I don't remember when.

1551
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:24,760
But um,
so his dad was an outstanding box or his

1552
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:29,790
uncle was an outstanding boxer and he 
grew up boxing,

1553
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,460
so he grew up knowing technique at a 
very early age when,

1554
01:06:33,461 --> 01:06:35,230
you know,
at a really early age you can get really

1555
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:37,720
good at it because you can get good at 
it later.

1556
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,050
There's a lot of fucking unicorns,
like people that don't make any sense,

1557
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,020
but when you're young you don't hit that
hard.

1558
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:49,070
Yeah.
So you and your buddies and hit each 

1559
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:49,930
other and you don't hurt each other.
So you'll learn how to box and you don't

1560
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:54,931
have the consequences.
If you learn how to box and you're 180 

1561
01:06:54,931 --> 01:06:57,640
pounds and you're boxing other dudes 
that are 180 pounds,

1562
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,260
you're fucking savages.

1563
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:02,380
And you throw in lead at each other.
We're boxing scary and dangerous.

1564
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,120
But when you're a little kid,
he can't even hear each other.

1565
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:09,300
Huh?
That's what actually joel carson was 

1566
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:09,300
saying that,
uh,

1567
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,420
it's way easier to teach kids how to 
like throw.

1568
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:13,400
Oh yeah.
Because you know your,

1569
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:16,840
your body fucks up when you're a 100,
200 pounds trying to throw somebody else

1570
01:07:16,841 --> 01:07:17,770
200 pounds.
Yeah.

1571
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,800
When you're 40 pounds,
you throw in another 40 pound or no one 

1572
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:22,800
gets hurt.
Yeah.

1573
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,990
Yeah.
Floyd's just as good as they've ever 

1574
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:27,010
been in.
In terms of boxing.

1575
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,950
He's got a unique style.
He doesn't take a lot of damage.

1576
01:07:29,951 --> 01:07:32,500
He's the best defensive boxer of all 
time.

1577
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:34,630
In terms of the amount of time that he 
gets hit,

1578
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,570
nobody gets hit less.
Yeah.

1579
01:07:37,571 --> 01:07:40,330
I don't know much about boxing or 
fighting at all,

1580
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:42,080
but the I,
I have.

1581
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:43,810
I mean I got to see that.
That's a freak show.

1582
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:48,190
It's not a boxing match because connor 
doesn't have a lot of boxing matches.

1583
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,640
It's not like we're looking at canelo 
alvarez when he was challenging floyd.

1584
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:53,710
We're going home.
You think canelo can get to them?

1585
01:07:53,711 --> 01:07:55,140
Well,
we can go back and look at this fight.

1586
01:07:55,141 --> 01:07:57,030
He did really well.
You can't look at anything.

1587
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:57,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

1588
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:01,180
AnD also look at anything.
Doesn't the wind the stamina?

1589
01:08:01,181 --> 01:08:03,970
I mean like a box or stamina.
He's got to go 12 rounds,

1590
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:05,650
right?
True she is what,

1591
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:08,110
a five rounds for championship fight,
but right.

1592
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:13,350
It's five,
five minute rounds with kicking and 

1593
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:13,350
wrestling.
Right.

1594
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:16,950
Fucking way easier to go.
Three minutes boxing than it is to go 

1595
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:20,891
five minutes of mma fucking ways.
I guess I didn't know that.

1596
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:23,810
I'm done grappling and shit.
No comparison.

1597
01:08:23,811 --> 01:08:25,670
Now that I've done either one of them 
professionally,

1598
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:31,120
but I'm just telling you as far as the 
amount of work that you put out in a 

1599
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,900
three minute round with just using your 
hands versus wrestling,

1600
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,810
fighting off submissions,
getting your legs kicked,

1601
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:41,200
kicking,
all those things require tremendous 

1602
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:41,200
amounts of energy.

1603
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,040
I think ufc athletes are some of the 
most conditioned athletes in the world.

1604
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:44,660
Oh yeah.
The high level.

1605
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,520
Like when you get to like a mighty mouse
level,

1606
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,830
when you know he's that guy can go five 
rounds,

1607
01:08:48,831 --> 01:08:50,640
full clip and never get done.
Guy.

1608
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:55,460
I mean we were talking about that guy 
who knows how much he gets hit.

1609
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:58,040
Don't nobody hits my new mouse these 
days.

1610
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:03,160
He's on such another level right now.
He's already several levels pass mighty 

1611
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:03,680
mouse,
demetrius mighty mouse johnson,

1612
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:08,681
who you talking about the asian guy know
who was the asian guy that kept getting 

1613
01:09:08,681 --> 01:09:09,130
punched in the face?
We talked about them.

1614
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:11,550
We Talked about,
uh,

1615
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:13,760
the korean superboy joy.
Yeah.

1616
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:15,950
that was the crazy fight with cubs wants
totally different.

1617
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,640
Mighty mouse is the pound for pound.
Best fighter in the ufc.

1618
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:20,600
Flyweight champion.
Okay.

1619
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:21,250
Do.
Whoa.

1620
01:09:21,251 --> 01:09:25,010
Joy is one of the most exciting 145 
pound contenders.

1621
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:28,190
And he had a fucking crazy fight with 
cubs won.

1622
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,720
It was crazy.
Oh my god.

1623
01:09:29,721 --> 01:09:32,240
It was just,
that was the blood and guts fight of the

1624
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:36,440
year because they were playing at the 
comedy store when it was on onto the.

1625
01:09:36,441 --> 01:09:38,270
Yeah.
That was a crazy fucking fight.

1626
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:40,330
Yeah.
It's um,

1627
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:45,730
it's,
it's all about like whether or not 

1628
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:46,370
connor could hit him and he probably 
can't hit him.

1629
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:46,970
I mean,
just,

1630
01:09:46,971 --> 01:09:48,530
you've got to be honest.
Probably cannot.

1631
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,720
We cannot,
we cannot.

1632
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:54,460
I mean,
floyd has been doing This for so long of

1633
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,050
boxer.
Yeah,

1634
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:57,440
it's a different.
It's a different world,

1635
01:09:57,441 --> 01:10:00,440
man.
It's a different world is no leg kicks.

1636
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:03,170
There's no take downs.
There's no.

1637
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:08,230
It's a different world.
Was it you that was saying somebody was 

1638
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:10,280
saying something about I'm connor has 
something.

1639
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:15,310
Has the one thing over floyd that 
nobody's ever had over him and that's 

1640
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:18,890
that he can say I can kick your fucking 
ass.

1641
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:19,670
Yeah,
I can fuck you up.

1642
01:10:19,671 --> 01:10:20,660
Is that you a chance?
Yeah,

1643
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,730
it is me.
If there was an mma fight,

1644
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,880
it would be.
Connor has a chance in a boxing match 

1645
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,840
because he knows that a poach.
Hansen zero,

1646
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:34,660
zero.
Its leg kick to take down to smash to 

1647
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,200
strangle every day,
all day for the rest of your life.

1648
01:10:36,201 --> 01:10:37,900
A baseball player in the octagon.
Yeah,

1649
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:41,770
because for sport even can't even punch 
him if conner's kicking them.

1650
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,600
Like if they just let connor kick.
If they said,

1651
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:45,740
okay,
listen,

1652
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,750
you can't do mma,
but you can kick.

1653
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:50,450
Oh my god,
I'm putting all the money on con.

1654
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:51,500
Really?
ONe hundred percent of it.

1655
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:55,130
100 fucking percent.
You let them kick jesus christ.

1656
01:10:55,190 --> 01:11:00,190
How?
How many leg kicks you think floyd 

1657
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:01,931
mayweather jr can take even if he's 
blocking to and he'd connor's going to 

1658
01:11:01,931 --> 01:11:01,931
sidekick his knees.
The legs.

1659
01:11:01,931 --> 01:11:02,750
Yeah,
that's the worst county.

1660
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:07,900
Fuck his legs up.
It's never going to get close enough to 

1661
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:07,900
hit him.
He's going to side kick his legs.

1662
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:08,330
He's gonna sidekick.
His body.

1663
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:11,180
He's gonna.
I mean there's no chance.

1664
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:16,240
No chance,
but first take the legs away and no 

1665
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:16,240
chance for conner.
Not no chance for connor,

1666
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,790
but boy,
if you have money,

1667
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:19,340
you know,
boohoo.

1668
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,770
You bet.
I remember the first time I,

1669
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:27,570
I felt a kick to my leg.
I couldn't believe how hard I bad at.

1670
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,590
Horrible.
Yeah,

1671
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:29,760
it's horrible.
Yeah,

1672
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,860
dude,
there was this guy named pedro.

1673
01:11:31,861 --> 01:11:36,861
His was a one of the top ufc 
heavyweights fought all over the place 

1674
01:11:36,861 --> 01:11:39,570
and um,
he used to leg kick guys and he was this

1675
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:42,400
big fucking brazilian dude.
This was a long,

1676
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:48,070
long time ago.
Back then he would submit guys just by 

1677
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:48,070
kicking their legs,
break your leg.

1678
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:52,120
He'd break his leg kicks were so heavy.
You would hear them like ring side.

1679
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:53,970
It Would just sound different to say,
oh no,

1680
01:11:53,971 --> 01:11:56,670
this guy's going to let him kick him.
No,

1681
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,100
this is not always going to low kick a 
journalist.

1682
01:11:59,101 --> 01:12:00,320
he's going to hold the pad.
Yeah,

1683
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:01,170
that's pedro.
His.

1684
01:12:01,171 --> 01:12:02,700
Oh no,
don't do it.

1685
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,610
He's going to let him kick his leg.
Now look at the size of pedro.

1686
01:12:05,611 --> 01:12:06,810
He's giant,
huge.

1687
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:10,440
Don't journalist.
This guy's going to let them do that.

1688
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,030
come on.
They're not going to do it.

1689
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:17,040
Did he get just.
That's not even an exaggeration.

1690
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,490
He touched you like that with his leg 
and you have a charlie horse.

1691
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:23,040
I'm not kidding,
dude.

1692
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:26,010
He was a gorilla.
he's the hardest,

1693
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:29,400
hardest leg kicks I've ever seen because
he was a big ass heavyweight.

1694
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:32,010
Is this guy going to hold a pattern?
What was going to go flYing?

1695
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:36,440
This is going to be awful for him.
Even with the pad here goes.

1696
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:40,620
No,
come on son.

1697
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:46,100
That dude just flew through the air and 
flipped and landed on his face and it 

1698
01:12:46,471 --> 01:12:48,780
didn't look like it was nothing for him,
for the other guy.

1699
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:50,130
Dude.
That's how hard pedro,

1700
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:55,131
his own kicks.
You got to understand that there's no 

1701
01:12:55,131 --> 01:12:55,131
way that was 100 percent either.
Oh,

1702
01:12:55,131 --> 01:12:56,730
probably was really.
You want me to say it again?

1703
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,310
The dude flew through the air.
that was 170 pound man.

1704
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,840
He went flying through the air.
THat guy flew.

1705
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,520
He was terrified.
At least he went with it.

1706
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:13,950
He fought rigo rodriguez.
Rico was one of the top,

1707
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,030
uh,
ufc heavyweight.

1708
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:20,031
So at the time.
And he hit him with a leg kick and he 

1709
01:13:20,031 --> 01:13:21,960
could see the look of rico was like,
what the fuck is that all about?

1710
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:25,410
He just had a different amount of power 
like that.

1711
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:30,540
It was like George Foreman punches,
but with the legs just had a totally 

1712
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,910
different thing going on.
You were you a big fan of boxing back?

1713
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,180
Yeah.
Huge ufc and all that.

1714
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:36,990
Oh yeah,
man.

1715
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:39,180
I still am.
Still am a big fan of boxing.

1716
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:44,210
I love boxing is exciting because like 
when you see a guy like a sergei kovalev

1717
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:48,870
first versus andre ward looked last 
fight,

1718
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:54,620
you're seeing like the margin of error 
that each guy is operating in is so 

1719
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,280
small and it's just two things.

1720
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,220
It's just left hand right hand.
These are two weapons,

1721
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,770
right,
and the margin of error that you have.

1722
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:06,800
One,
one guy's an expert and punching people 

1723
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,541
in the face and the other guy's an 
expert at punching people in the face 

1724
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:11,150
and you're moving around trying to find 
your openings and these like world class

1725
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:17,160
top of the food chain guys are trying to
smash each other with their punches and 

1726
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,560
that's all they have to rely on.
So in making sometHing like very limited

1727
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:25,890
to me,
especially because I've watched so much 

1728
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:25,890
mma,
it becomes interesting because I'm like,

1729
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:30,031
okay,
now I don't have to think about leg 

1730
01:14:30,031 --> 01:14:30,031
kicks.
You don't have to think about takedowns.

1731
01:14:30,031 --> 01:14:30,850
All I have to think about is which guy,
you know,

1732
01:14:30,851 --> 01:14:32,620
like which guy is gonna be able to solve
this puzzle.

1733
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:35,290
And it's very fascinating to me to the 
point where people.

1734
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:37,620
I like fights that people get mad at,
like they get,

1735
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:38,600
they go,
that fight suck,

1736
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:41,440
excited because they thought it wasn't 
exciting or whatever.

1737
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,080
Yeah,
exactly.

1738
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:47,220
Exactly.
Well that's why I've always been a fan 

1739
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:47,220
of floyd mayweather.
Yeah.

1740
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:47,220
Because of what he's able to do,
defensive,

1741
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:49,150
like nobody can do what he does.
That's cool.

1742
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,300
Yeah.
He saId he's an amazing defensive boxer.

1743
01:14:52,301 --> 01:14:56,050
I mean every fighter should watch them.
Everybody should learn it.

1744
01:14:56,051 --> 01:14:58,660
Just like how he could stand right in 
front of you too.

1745
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:01,180
I mean we stood right in front of guys 
just fucking.

1746
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:04,420
There was a video on youtube.
I was watching where the guy was like,

1747
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:09,421
I want to show you guys that had moved 
that I'll just make sure you don't want 

1748
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:09,430
to even block,
but that's how I'll never get hit in the

1749
01:15:09,431 --> 01:15:10,170
head.
And,

1750
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:12,250
and he goes up to random people on the 
street and he's like,

1751
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:13,650
hey,
I've seen that guy.

1752
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,920
It was like go ahead and try to punch me
for like a minute and I'm not going to 

1753
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:18,920
block.
I knew the guy was like,

1754
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:23,491
okay,
and then he just never gets hit in the 

1755
01:15:23,491 --> 01:15:23,491
face because you're doing this fucking 
head bop.

1756
01:15:23,491 --> 01:15:24,670
Yeah.
But he's got to fInd the right guys.

1757
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:29,920
Well,
I mean he's not finding professional 

1758
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:29,920
boxers and you roll up on deontay 
wilder.

1759
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,180
Alright,
I'll do it.

1760
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:32,680
But still,
I mean,

1761
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:34,270
you know,
that's interesting.

1762
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,950
I wouldn't have thought about that.
Yeah.

1763
01:15:35,951 --> 01:15:40,951
A guy who could move his head like floyd
mayweather or wassily loma chenko like 

1764
01:15:40,951 --> 01:15:41,440
that,
that kind of guy.

1765
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:44,830
The guy who can stand right in front of 
you and you can't hit them.

1766
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:46,570
That's one of the most terrifying guys 
to face.

1767
01:15:46,571 --> 01:15:51,571
Fucking crazy.
You can't hit them like it's just not 

1768
01:15:51,571 --> 01:15:52,690
there.
And then he's hitting you all the time.

1769
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,280
He's sending,
getting frustrated and getting your.

1770
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:58,970
When you're getting winded or missed a 
punch and you realize your spiderweb.

1771
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,880
Yeah,
you're slowly getting lit up.

1772
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:02,360
That's what's going to be interesting 
too,

1773
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:06,730
to see what happens to connor.
If he does find himself in the web,

1774
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:12,040
he finds himself in a web,
whether or not he tries to distance 

1775
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:12,820
himself with floyd,
floyd and stay on the outside.

1776
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Whether or not he tries to clinch up 
with them and bullying or whether he 

1777
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,610
does something like really confusing the
floyd doesn't expect like it's like his 

1778
01:16:21,341 --> 01:16:22,690
coach,
john cavanaugh,

1779
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:25,300
the guy who's coached him in mma.
Very,

1780
01:16:25,301 --> 01:16:29,730
very smart guy and a brilliant tactician
and together their team is.

1781
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:31,250
I liked their approach,
they're very,

1782
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:36,270
very unique approach and one of the 
things they do is they come up with 

1783
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:39,241
these really unorthodox training 
routines because his statement that 

1784
01:16:39,241 --> 01:16:43,210
really rings true with me is he says we 
want to upgrade the hardware,

1785
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,760
upgrade the software without damaging 
the hardware.

1786
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:46,120
Kevin.
Oh,

1787
01:16:46,121 --> 01:16:51,121
says yeah.
So they do a lot of drills instead of 

1788
01:16:51,121 --> 01:16:53,251
like constant hard sparring.
And the idea is that when you do hard 

1789
01:16:53,251 --> 01:16:56,431
sparring all the time,
the problem is like it's hard for 

1790
01:16:56,431 --> 01:16:59,251
experimentation because punished if you 
fuck up and it's hard to download new 

1791
01:16:59,951 --> 01:17:00,940
stuff.
And then the other,

1792
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:05,260
the other hand doing things like just 
doing drills over and over again,

1793
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:10,340
it can get kinda boring.
so they come up with all these 

1794
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:13,110
innovative cool to incorporate new kinds
of movements and a lot of it's weird,

1795
01:17:13,191 --> 01:17:18,191
like they throw throw cards at him.
He's got this guy throws cards out of 

1796
01:17:18,191 --> 01:17:18,191
many punches.
The cardS.

1797
01:17:18,191 --> 01:17:20,480
I've seen that effective if at all that 
is,

1798
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:23,780
but it's a freak show.
That's what's.

1799
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:27,530
I mean,
the crazy thing is what a fucking connor

1800
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:28,640
when.
Yes,

1801
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:31,670
that's,
that's,

1802
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,770
that's like kind of bad for boxing.

1803
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:35,510
So awesome for conor mcgregor.
Oh,

1804
01:17:35,511 --> 01:17:40,511
it's great for him.
I don't think it's bad for boxing 

1805
01:17:40,511 --> 01:17:40,630
because conor mcgregor can box.
I mean he really can boxer.

1806
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,410
The question is can he box man?
Right,

1807
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,030
right,
right,

1808
01:17:44,031 --> 01:17:44,840
right.
Big difference.

1809
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:48,590
You know,
conor mcgregor is the biggest star ever.

1810
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,870
Oh yeah.
never if he knocks out.

1811
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:54,830
Floyd mayweather.
He's the biggest athlete of all time.

1812
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:56,870
He becomes,
first of all in europe,

1813
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:01,900
he becomes the king of europe.
They just give him crowns and they make 

1814
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:05,300
a castle forum as crazy did.
If he,

1815
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:10,360
if he knocks out floyd mayweather.
He is like literally probably the most 

1816
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:11,690
popular athlete of all time.
HE might surpass like,

1817
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:14,300
he's like in muhammad ali levels,
right?

1818
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,490
I mean he's already,
he's already.

1819
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:19,500
Yeah,
I think mohammed ali was probably,

1820
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:22,610
it wasn't our time,
but I think he was probably at a totally

1821
01:18:22,611 --> 01:18:27,611
different level because muhammad ali 
also represented the civil rights 

1822
01:18:27,611 --> 01:18:27,611
movement,
right.

1823
01:18:27,611 --> 01:18:30,470
Represented the bigger than just the 
resistance to the Vietnam war.

1824
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,810
He lost his license to fight for three 
years.

1825
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:34,100
It's a story.
Yeah.

1826
01:18:34,101 --> 01:18:34,850
He's,
he's a,

1827
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:39,710
he's a symbol of a generation.
connor is just an amazing fighter,

1828
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,940
so takeaway muhammad ali,
and I think he's probably on his way,

1829
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:47,150
but if he loses and he gets embarrassed 
by floyd,

1830
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,520
even still,
it's not a sport.

1831
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:52,610
He's got nothing to lose.
I mean he's making $100,000,000

1832
01:18:52,611 --> 01:18:53,780
anyway.
Who the fuck knows?

1833
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,510
I'm sure it's a ton.
Okay,

1834
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:59,690
so many people are gonna be watching.
How could it not be.

1835
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,840
The craziest thing about connor is that 
four years ago he,

1836
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:04,650
nobody knew who the fuck he was.
Yeah,

1837
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,260
I mean that's,
that's crazy.

1838
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:11,261
That's like there's no profession where 
like all of a sudden you're that big of 

1839
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,820
a star,
but it doesn't even exist in mma.

1840
01:19:13,821 --> 01:19:14,570
You to understand.

1841
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:16,550
Nobody else does that.
It's just him.

1842
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:17,780
So.
So what happened?

1843
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:19,040
He's,
by the way,

1844
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:20,970
he's like 28.
Jesus christ.

1845
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:21,830
Twenty eight,
29.

1846
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:27,130
I tweeted him when he won the cage 
warriors title or you made it might've 

1847
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:29,270
been defending his title.
I think it was cage warriors,

1848
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,080
but he flatlined some doodles like this.
Kids fucking really?

1849
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,460
Yeah,
and I tweeted them,

1850
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:35,780
congratulations.
And I said,

1851
01:19:35,781 --> 01:19:40,280
I hope to see in the ufc some daY and 
that was like 2013.

1852
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:45,790
Wow.
That's because the access tv shout out 

1853
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:45,790
to access tv,
formerly hd net.

1854
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:48,230
They had so many good fIghts online.
Actually.

1855
01:19:48,231 --> 01:19:53,231
maybe it was the internet.
I might have been on the internet 

1856
01:19:53,231 --> 01:19:54,200
actually now that I think caught your 
eye just looks sensational.

1857
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:56,990
Hope to see in the ufc someday.
That's cool man.

1858
01:19:57,410 --> 01:19:59,750
God that's crazy.
Two thousand 13.

1859
01:19:59,751 --> 01:20:04,751
January of 2013.
But to think that he tweeted that then 

1860
01:20:04,751 --> 01:20:06,950
and then and then now the biggest 
fighter on the planet.

1861
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:08,030
That was

1862
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,010
before he even came there.
That's just prEtty dope.

1863
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:16,690
so basically you're saying he rose so 
quickly because he's just something 

1864
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:16,690
special.
Yeah,

1865
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:20,811
I got you.
He's something special and he knocks 

1866
01:20:20,811 --> 01:20:20,811
people dead.
you know,

1867
01:20:20,811 --> 01:20:22,830
he's except everybody except nate diaz.
Nate diaz.

1868
01:20:22,831 --> 01:20:24,800
That just shows what a bad motherfucker 
he is.

1869
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:27,810
He's the most underutilized fighter in 
mma period.

1870
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:30,990
In terms of like his star power,
like capitalizing on it.

1871
01:20:30,991 --> 01:20:34,940
I don't think the ufc even knows how 
fucking huge nate diaz is.

1872
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,480
And nick his brother,
nick.

1873
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:41,620
Branding wise.
you're saying and just everybody loves 

1874
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:41,620
those guys.
They're fucking characters.

1875
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:44,010
Yeah.
like an american version of snatched.

1876
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:46,650
That's fucking funny,
right?

1877
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:48,440
Is it snatched or snatch?
Snatch.

1878
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,570
Movie snatched.
Was the goldie hawn?

1879
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:56,610
Yes.
Amy schumer talking about snap get 

1880
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:56,640
confused and there's another snatched.
The snake.

1881
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:59,360
Snatched is maybe like a tv show on the 
id channel.

1882
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:03,420
Should,
I mean I always snatched.

1883
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:08,370
It'd be great if it was either alien 
abductions or a guy works on supposed to

1884
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:11,610
see dr.
I like to trim them.

1885
01:21:11,611 --> 01:21:16,611
Extra.
Snatched your cleaning up this wider 

1886
01:21:16,611 --> 01:21:18,560
pussy.
You know who dr.

1887
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:19,800
Yeah.
No.

1888
01:21:19,801 --> 01:21:21,660
Uh,
yeah.

1889
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:26,520
But that guy to me,
nate diaz looks like a fucking a guy you

1890
01:21:26,521 --> 01:21:27,630
don't fuck with.
Oh yeah,

1891
01:21:27,631 --> 01:21:29,100
for sure.
He's huge.

1892
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:31,590
People don't realize how he is.
Nate is in between fights.

1893
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:34,470
motherfuckers walking around like 200 
pounds is huge.

1894
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:37,710
It's big fella.
Big and super good.

1895
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:38,610
So how did he.
Oh,

1896
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:40,550
he just leaned out to fight conor.
Yeah.

1897
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:43,170
Just.
Well they fought at one 70 both times.

1898
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,040
That's so much weight to lose as a 200 
pounds.

1899
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:46,670
But,
uh,

1900
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,260
you do it slow,
you know,

1901
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,110
you do it over the course of a,
you know,

1902
01:21:50,111 --> 01:21:52,050
like,
I'm sure he's carrying some body fat now

1903
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,810
when he got down to 1:50
5:55

1904
01:21:54,811 --> 01:21:57,750
before when he fought at 55,
before the conor fight,

1905
01:21:57,751 --> 01:22:01,350
he fought Michael Johnson,
one of his best fights at 55 and 1:55

1906
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:03,050
dude shredded at the weigh ins.

1907
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,800
Insane in that fight for the weigh ins.
He was obviouslY in like crazy,

1908
01:22:11,881 --> 01:22:14,070
crazy shape.
SMokes weed by the way,

1909
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:15,960
hollow.
Well,

1910
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:18,360
now everybody thinks that weed makes you
lazy.

1911
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:19,740
Come on.
Well,

1912
01:22:19,741 --> 01:22:21,320
no,
I mean lazy makes you lazy.

1913
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:23,760
He smoke weed like that.
Shredded.

1914
01:22:23,761 --> 01:22:25,470
Wow.
Is that from that fight?

1915
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:27,530
That's it right there.
Look at that.

1916
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:29,750
Boom son.
That's our cuts.

1917
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:34,430
Mean looking motherfucker.
He doesn't have no fat that uh,

1918
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:37,380
he's had some sensational ufc victories 
to,

1919
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,750
um,
well,

1920
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:41,610
I mean the guy should be.
I mean,

1921
01:22:41,611 --> 01:22:44,490
he made a shitload of money on the conor
fight and the rematch.

1922
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:48,240
I'm sure we've made a shitload of money.
But now what though?

1923
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:51,990
What's he going to do right there?
Jesus christ body.

1924
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:53,700
You could set him up with some good 
fights.

1925
01:22:53,701 --> 01:22:56,010
That was when connor was severely 
dehydrated.

1926
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,600
That's a 1:45
pound picture,

1927
01:22:57,601 --> 01:23:00,420
I believe.
Yeah.

1928
01:23:00,421 --> 01:23:01,440
It's fight night.
Yeah.

1929
01:23:01,441 --> 01:23:03,140
So that was a 1:45
pound picture.

1930
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,670
That was before you had the notorious on
his abs.

1931
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:07,390
Fucked up,
man.

1932
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,560
Do that.
Vicious abs.

1933
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,100
Just scribbled on them.

1934
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:16,600
But Yeah,
when you see him at one 70,

1935
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:19,480
like when you fought eddie alvarez at 
1:55

1936
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:21,240
or a genius.
Yeah,

1937
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:23,290
he's the 1:55
champ now.

1938
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,080
What's really fuckeD up because he was 
the 1:45

1939
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:28,880
pound champ.
And then he just left the title one,

1940
01:23:28,890 --> 01:23:33,890
155 pound title.
So now he had two world titles in the 

1941
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:37,831
ufc and then he just sort of take the.
See that picture right there is way 

1942
01:23:37,831 --> 01:23:37,831
bigger there.
Yeah.

1943
01:23:37,831 --> 01:23:39,310
Jacked.
Wow.

1944
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,890
That's the nate diaz rematch.
He was jacked.

1945
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:44,200
But how tall is he?
Tall,

1946
01:23:44,201 --> 01:23:45,330
right?
Um,

1947
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:46,390
he's five.
Nine.

1948
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:50,040
Yeah.
Nate diaz is what's assets to it too.

1949
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,330
So that's the alvis fight.
Okay.

1950
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:53,680
So that's one.
That's him at 1:55

1951
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:55,450
actually to nate diaz fight.
Well,

1952
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:58,030
I bet they're were real similar in 
sizes.

1953
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:02,840
That's the nate diaz fight his lat.
Now that's alvarez because it's a.

1954
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,030
He's jacked,
isn't mcgregor.

1955
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:05,720
oh,
does it?

1956
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:06,430
Oh,
you're right.

1957
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:07,240
Oh yeah,
that's right.

1958
01:24:07,241 --> 01:24:08,680
Ufc 202,
right?

1959
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:09,570
Yeah.
Okay,

1960
01:24:09,571 --> 01:24:10,690
so that's.
That makes seNse.

1961
01:24:10,691 --> 01:24:13,110
Because he's won 70 in this picture.
Yeah,

1962
01:24:13,530 --> 01:24:15,570
that's incredible.
That's not not.

1963
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:16,600
I would have said,
hey man,

1964
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,720
put that somewhere else.
Put that shit on your back or something.

1965
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:26,760
fuck up your abs on a.
But you know when it comes to 

1966
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:29,320
personalities,
personalities and finding.

1967
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:30,510
See this.
See the difference.

1968
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,410
He looks.
He looks different,

1969
01:24:32,411 --> 01:24:32,890
huh?
Yeah.

1970
01:24:32,891 --> 01:24:34,990
He was so sucked in for that first 
fight.

1971
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:41,550
Jesus christ.
He looks like he looks at the on the 

1972
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:45,841
top.
He looks like a guy that will like yell 

1973
01:24:45,841 --> 01:24:45,841
at you on the street corner like a crazy
person.

1974
01:24:45,841 --> 01:24:46,690
You're on the bottom of his faces.
Nice and full.

1975
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:48,070
It looks so.
He's going to kill you.

1976
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:50,440
He's.
I'm going to make a lot of money.

1977
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:52,760
Whether or not he could beat that guy 
either way.

1978
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:55,230
It's going to be fascinating to see.
It's going to be fast,

1979
01:24:55,650 --> 01:25:00,650
isn't it?
Isn't it not to talk about this too 

1980
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:00,650
much,
but it isn't it,

1981
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:03,280
isn't it like soon to have the,
like they didn't have time to train.

1982
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:06,520
Exactly.
Which is why I think what flOyd wants,

1983
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:11,440
like floyd was probably in great shape 
and I think I'm actually.

1984
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:15,130
It's probably good to do it this way.
I think they prepared for it for quite a

1985
01:25:15,131 --> 01:25:17,080
long time before they actually committed
to it.

1986
01:25:17,081 --> 01:25:21,610
I hope at least I know he was preparing.
He didn't take anY mma fights.

1987
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:24,880
Didn't even think about it.
This kind of soon though.

1988
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:26,260
August.
Just around the corner.

1989
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:28,010
which she wasn't working well,
so can't,

1990
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:31,390
can't.
They make so much money if they waited.

1991
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:32,440
I don't know,
man.

1992
01:25:32,441 --> 01:25:35,020
This is such a freak show.
I think it might be playing it,

1993
01:25:35,021 --> 01:25:35,680
right?
Yeah.

1994
01:25:35,681 --> 01:25:36,370
Maybe.
Yeah,

1995
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,700
because this ain't some thing like 
you're gonna plan out for six months.

1996
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:41,860
People might lose steam.
Yeah.

1997
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:42,980
Maybe you're right.
Yeah.

1998
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,390
Yeah.
Maybe.

1999
01:25:43,391 --> 01:25:48,391
Right.
You know what's the most dragged out 

2000
01:25:48,391 --> 01:25:50,401
fight of all time?
John claude van damme was going to have 

2001
01:25:50,401 --> 01:25:50,401
a,
a.

2002
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:55,500
Was it a kickboxing fight?
I think it was a kickboxing fight with 

2003
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:58,351
some cat,
some thai guy who won the gold medal in 

2004
01:25:58,351 --> 01:26:02,521
the olympics and they went around for 
years and never deposing having like 

2005
01:26:02,521 --> 01:26:03,170
offs and shit.

2006
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,400
Yeah,
I never did it.

2007
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:05,450
Never did it.
Yeah.

2008
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:06,540
That's hilarious.
Oh,

2009
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,900
he had the best reality show.
John clark.

2010
01:26:08,901 --> 01:26:09,980
John danny.
There was my favorite.

2011
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:15,040
I love that Dude.
That volvo commercial or whatever the 

2012
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,040
fuck it was.
It was.

2013
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,040
And he's got his legs spread between the
two trucks.

2014
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,740
It's real.
I mean,

2015
01:26:17,741 --> 01:26:22,741
you definitely do the splits,
but I really don't think they want to 

2016
01:26:22,741 --> 01:26:22,741
rescue this way.
It's ridiculous.

2017
01:26:22,741 --> 01:26:25,160
I mean,
is it god that guy.

2018
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,870
I remember I watched street fighter 
twice in one day.

2019
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:32,000
Who was he in streets as the guy?
A guy.

2020
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:32,690
Old guy?
Yeah.

2021
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,690
I'm going to kick that son of a bitch.
Bisons his sword.

2022
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:40,550
He would say,
so the fucking killed me.

2023
01:26:40,551 --> 01:26:41,620
I said,
he's an award.

2024
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:43,380
What is this?
Oh,

2025
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,620
I'm a statue in brussels.
Wow.

2026
01:26:45,621 --> 01:26:47,180
Powerful.
John claude van damme.

2027
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:50,900
Look at him.
So happy sunglasses doesn't give a fuck.

2028
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:56,030
I know what a character.
He's got Russia.

2029
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:59,090
He has people,
he just looking at john claude van damme

2030
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:04,460
has to have like you can,
it looks like a guy who would have the 

2031
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,490
darkest sexual life,
who,

2032
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:07,790
you know what I mean,
like,

2033
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:12,870
like,
like has a white cottony blah blow 

2034
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:12,870
security right now.
Oh,

2035
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:14,760
it makes the life cycle of security 
guards too.

2036
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:16,160
Sucky.
Stick.

2037
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:17,210
Wow.
No doubt.

2038
01:27:17,211 --> 01:27:22,211
I don't think so man.
Well that's how he looks and he has his 

2039
01:27:22,211 --> 01:27:22,820
sunglasses on.
It's nighttime.

2040
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:26,690
That's it.
You're telling me.

2041
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:27,470
Come on,
I look at.

2042
01:27:27,471 --> 01:27:29,360
I'm looking right there.
Boom.

2043
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:32,810
Security right now.
That's it.

2044
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:37,900
I know guys who've had that happen where
they were with a guy and the guy wanted 

2045
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:45,550
his wife to suck their dick.
A friend of mine said that this guy was 

2046
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:49,910
coaching his wife through sucking his 
dick and he had just met the two of them

2047
01:27:49,911 --> 01:27:50,420
that night.

2048
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:52,870
That's some different.
Uh,

2049
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:56,930
I don't.
I mean like what does he get?

2050
01:27:56,931 --> 01:27:59,090
Bored or what a.
Yeah,

2051
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:04,180
something like a thing that is with you 
before that and then it just comes out 

2052
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:04,180
or.
Because that's.

2053
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:05,590
What is that like?
That's like that.

2054
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:06,860
Yeah.
I don't know.

2055
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,170
It's a good question,
like it can't be,

2056
01:28:09,171 --> 01:28:12,740
it can't be one day or just like,
you know,

2057
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:15,620
suck his dick,
you know,

2058
01:28:15,621 --> 01:28:20,270
it's not like that.
It has to be when with you before that.

2059
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:21,520
Yeah.
I would imagine.

2060
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:22,820
Has to be.
Yeah.

2061
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:25,480
Who knows?
I don't know.

2062
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:28,670
Might be.
I don't know though,

2063
01:28:28,671 --> 01:28:30,350
you know,
it's one of those things we got to think

2064
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:33,800
why does it bother us?
Well here's the deal,

2065
01:28:33,801 --> 01:28:38,801
man.
Being being in an open relationship is 

2066
01:28:38,801 --> 01:28:38,801
different than watch.
Well yeah,

2067
01:28:38,801 --> 01:28:39,860
but still why does it bother us?
I see what you're saying.

2068
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:40,640
Why does it bother us?

2069
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,830
But it does like you.
Like for the most part.

2070
01:28:42,831 --> 01:28:47,831
Yeah.
The idea that somehow or another you 

2071
01:28:47,831 --> 01:28:48,220
could blow a fuse and then you're right 
next to a guy going,

2072
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:48,820
you liked that?
Huh?

2073
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:52,100
Honey work the balls.
I suck.

2074
01:28:52,101 --> 01:28:53,730
I suck.
One was balls in your mouth.

2075
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:55,940
Do the thing.
I like put your hand to him.

2076
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:58,490
Jerk your hand off.
Like where your fingers are facing him.

2077
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:04,330
But it's,
it's a fucking weird thing man.

2078
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:08,150
It's super weird because I was like,
what?

2079
01:29:08,151 --> 01:29:09,570
What do you.
It's a power thing right?

2080
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,940
It's a power thing,
I guess.

2081
01:29:11,941 --> 01:29:16,941
It's also like I'm a freak thing.
It's like we're being naughty or doing 

2082
01:29:16,941 --> 01:29:17,490
something dangerous.
We're,

2083
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:22,491
we're rebels were something,
what are we going to get?

2084
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:24,600
Some weird stuff.
But I've had a,

2085
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:28,020
I had a fan once their driver came up to
me and he was like,

2086
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:28,680
hi.

2087
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31,380
Um,
I was instructed to come over here and I

2088
01:29:31,381 --> 01:29:36,381
want you to meet this guy wants you to 
meet his wife and sleep with them.

2089
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:39,490
It was in chicago with her.
You mean to hurry?

2090
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:43,410
Either way I'm not doing it for all,
but I really wanted to fuck him.

2091
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:45,270
That was the thing.
This face.

2092
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:50,840
Imagine if there was like a guy out 
there sort of how that like picture 

2093
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,640
makes epileptics have seizures.
Yeah.

2094
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:55,350
There was a guy out there that makes 
your dick hard and just didn't expect it

2095
01:29:55,351 --> 01:29:56,910
at all.
out of nowhere.

2096
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,610
Like you might not even have to like see
them in person,

2097
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:05,090
but if it's a god that's so pretty,
like they figured out a way to have the 

2098
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:06,510
perfect amount of masculine but not even
pretty.

2099
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:08,970
Just the kind of vibe you like,
his vibe,

2100
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:14,660
like a bear,
like a John Hanson crystal guy because 

2101
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:14,660
like I'm not gay.

2102
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:14,660
I was like,
look,

2103
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:15,510
I'm not gay.
I never had sex with a guy,

2104
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:19,290
but if I was going to I think I would 
pick like a big guy.

2105
01:30:19,530 --> 01:30:22,530
A nice looking guy.
Not like a pretty guy,

2106
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:26,550
right?
Like tom selleck aNd it's prime shoes.

2107
01:30:26,551 --> 01:30:28,330
No socks.
Red car.

2108
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:33,910
Chris,
what's up with the flowers and your 

2109
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:33,910
shirt,
bro?

2110
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:34,350
That's how you hit on it.
Hey man.

2111
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:35,700
What's up with the flowers and your 
shirt?

2112
01:30:35,701 --> 01:30:38,250
What are you doing later?
How come you were a socks?

2113
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:40,590
You feet stink.
Don't lie to me bro.

2114
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:44,910
He's a handsome guy.
Guy in white man right there in Hawaii.

2115
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:47,670
I always used to think when tom selleck 
was in Hawaii,

2116
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:49,980
magnum pi was in Hawaii.
I would always think like,

2117
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:51,800
does he hate being in Hawaii?
After awhile?

2118
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:56,890
You get to about like [inaudible],
like last and then they do who I follow 

2119
01:30:56,890 --> 01:30:56,890
there.

2120
01:30:56,890 --> 01:30:56,890
By the way,
that guy.

2121
01:30:56,890 --> 01:31:00,990
There's a guy,
there's a guy that was on both lost in 

2122
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:00,990
Hawaii.
Five o.

2123
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:01,420
Well,
he probably loves it down there.

2124
01:31:01,421 --> 01:31:03,810
It must listen man.
People who lived down there,

2125
01:31:03,811 --> 01:31:06,690
you're living in paradise except for the
occasional hurricane.

2126
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:08,550
OTher than that,
you live in paradise.

2127
01:31:08,551 --> 01:31:09,210
Yeah,
but it's also.

2128
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:10,180
I mean,
dude,

2129
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,130
it's so humid,
man.

2130
01:31:11,131 --> 01:31:16,131
I mean I was in,
I was in west palm beach this past 

2131
01:31:16,131 --> 01:31:16,710
weekend.
I was like,

2132
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,000
yeah,
it's beautiful,

2133
01:31:18,001 --> 01:31:21,540
but like it's too hot.
Ninety two degrees feels like 4,000

2134
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:22,770
degrees.
yeah.

2135
01:31:22,771 --> 01:31:25,560
it gets funky and then you close it out 
to la and you're like,

2136
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:26,820
oh,
this is the best.

2137
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:28,230
It's dry.
It's dry.

2138
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,150
It's the best.
Yeah.

2139
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,950
Like phoenix.
Phoenix can get hot as fuck.

2140
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:33,300
Phoenix is just.
Yeah,

2141
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:35,730
but you're landlocked too.
I feel like nice.

2142
01:31:35,731 --> 01:31:37,590
If you're a true right,
you just get in a boat.

2143
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:40,860
If shit gets rough and I have a load on 
your deck,

2144
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:46,190
like tie it down.
Even if you're just in santa monica or 

2145
01:31:46,190 --> 01:31:48,711
like the valley as a tsunami hits,
you get indexed and you always like 

2146
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:52,380
freeze dried foods.
Would you want to be the guy gets hIt in

2147
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:57,381
the head by the asteroid or would you 
want to be the guy that has to figure 

2148
01:31:57,381 --> 01:32:00,921
out how to rebuild civilization again 
because they get hit in the head.

2149
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:05,340
The nice and quick view,
if you got to rebuild civilization,

2150
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:07,390
count how many moving in,
how many?

2151
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,500
Forty,
40 people.

2152
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:09,700
That's it.
Yeah,

2153
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:11,650
that's it.
I probably won't get hit in the head.

2154
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:13,900
Then you have to fuck your sister in 
order to make people.

2155
01:32:13,901 --> 01:32:14,700
I don't have one.
thank god.

2156
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:22,050
What do you do?
If it's just you and your sister and 

2157
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:23,230
you're the only two people that want to 
get hit and head for sure,

2158
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:28,790
but if you are alive right now and she's
alive and she wants to stay alive and 

2159
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:28,790
you're like,
look,

2160
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:30,340
there's only one way you can make more 
people and just have people with that.

2161
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:31,750
Don't you have kIds with down's syndrome
and shit?

2162
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:33,540
Not yet.
I think it takes a while.

2163
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,710
Takes a few generations,
but even worse than that,

2164
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:40,920
you bang each other and then you have to
bang your kids or the kids have to bang 

2165
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,990
after because otherwise that's it.
It stops right there.

2166
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:49,140
So then it has to be,
it's got to get to a certain point with 

2167
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:52,170
30 or 40 people.
Everyone's fucking their kids and then 

2168
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:52,170
you have to make new rules.
Okay,

2169
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:53,860
let that planet people who can't fuck 
your kids.

2170
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:56,800
And right now your kids,
by the way,

2171
01:32:56,801 --> 01:32:59,050
this is how it used to be guys.
We can do it.

2172
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:00,370
Well,
that's when was this?

2173
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:03,120
Four hundred years ago before the big 
rock from the sky.

2174
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,830
Shut off the power.
I can't fill the Wifi,

2175
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:09,700
but my sister's hot.
They'd be shit like that.

2176
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,970
I know you mentioned like he forbid 
bidding now,

2177
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,860
but your mom and dad were brother and 
sister.

2178
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:20,110
you guys are fucking hypocrites.
That sounds like a fucking hulu series 

2179
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:25,360
that I was thinking the hallmark channel
now hulu.

2180
01:33:25,631 --> 01:33:27,130
Then you get to see like tits and shit 
in it.

2181
01:33:27,131 --> 01:33:29,530
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

2182
01:33:29,531 --> 01:33:30,170
You remember that?
Uh,

2183
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:34,180
do you remember that movie brown bunny?
Where vincent gallo the theater,

2184
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:37,300
and I brought my ex wife,
uh,

2185
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:39,880
you know what it was since she didn't.
And she was like,

2186
01:33:39,881 --> 01:33:40,480
what is it?
I was like,

2187
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:41,380
it's going to be good.
Want to go?

2188
01:33:41,381 --> 01:33:46,360
Because I love vincent gallo and uh,
I went to and when she sucks his dick in

2189
01:33:46,361 --> 01:33:48,880
the movie,
my ex goes like this.

2190
01:33:49,210 --> 01:33:50,440
Oh,
it's a porn.

2191
01:33:53,030 --> 01:33:54,880
And I left.
I left.

2192
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:59,120
what's crazy is it's a whole movie kind 
of one scene at the way.

2193
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:00,430
It doesn't matter.
I know.

2194
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:03,130
I know.
Isn't that hilarious?

2195
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:05,380
Yeah.
I like big vincent gallo,

2196
01:34:05,381 --> 01:34:06,940
does it?
He's so fucking weird.

2197
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:08,950
That's really kInd of crazy though,
right?

2198
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:14,410
Like if you have a movie one six,
if you have a movie where everything is 

2199
01:34:16,241 --> 01:34:21,241
like hilarious,
but then someone dies like a lot of 

2200
01:34:21,241 --> 01:34:21,850
comedies,
like someone dies.

2201
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:24,790
You don't say it's still a still a 
comedy.

2202
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:27,850
It's a comedy.
But if you had harrison ford,

2203
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:33,150
cate blanchette in a gripping thriller 
and then at the end they fucking,

2204
01:34:34,421 --> 01:34:37,260
you see in anodic shots like that.
It's a porn.

2205
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:40,040
You can't,
you can't not call it a port.

2206
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:42,340
That's hilarious.
It's weird,

2207
01:34:42,341 --> 01:34:44,530
right?
It's funny that like no Matter what else

2208
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:49,240
happened and like coming on her chest,
you can't do that.

2209
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,570
You can have a scene where like you see 
them,

2210
01:34:52,571 --> 01:34:57,190
like there's curtains you see is as you 
can sees,

2211
01:34:57,210 --> 01:34:58,220
right?
Her legs

2212
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,590
wrapper as long as it's tastefully done,
she's kissing.

2213
01:35:00,591 --> 01:35:05,591
but if you actually see a prIus and a 
vagina or a penis and a mouth or it has 

2214
01:35:06,321 --> 01:35:07,280
to be in it though.
Right?

2215
01:35:07,281 --> 01:35:09,140
Even if your penis and vagina is not 
porn,

2216
01:35:09,141 --> 01:35:10,820
do you ever see house of cards?
No.

2217
01:35:11,010 --> 01:35:13,050
There's a scene in house of cards where 
the president,

2218
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:16,070
spoiler alert is going down on a 
reporter.

2219
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:17,360
He's,
he's eating.

2220
01:35:17,361 --> 01:35:21,950
This report is box and like his face is 
right on her box,

2221
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:25,070
but it doesn't show us on the phone with
her dad.

2222
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:28,310
It's rough.
Netflix will fucking show whatever.

2223
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:34,080
There'll be like,
you'll watch the fucking the ranch with 

2224
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:34,100
ashton kutcher and you'll be like,
you have to stick.

2225
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:36,560
It's just like weird.
Yeah.

2226
01:35:36,561 --> 01:35:38,390
You can do anything.
I just showed my dick and my special.

2227
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:40,880
Did you how many times?
Just for.

2228
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,400
Wow.
That's all in the beginning though.

2229
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:46,460
That's a lot for you for an hour staring
at the coMedy store.

2230
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:48,860
I guess once you get ramped up,
you know you're doing a special.

2231
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,500
It probably should have done it,
but I was excited.

2232
01:35:54,501 --> 01:35:55,700
I was in Canada.
Oh,

2233
01:35:55,701 --> 01:35:57,530
in Canada.
you could show your dick freely.

2234
01:35:58,340 --> 01:36:00,030
There was a french.
Yeah,

2235
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:03,260
you can apparently walk around toronto 
with your breasts out.

2236
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:08,860
So there was this video that was 
released online earlier today of this 

2237
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:12,280
woman activist who was being interviewed
by this guy and she says it's totally 

2238
01:36:12,471 --> 01:36:17,270
legal to take your top off.
So she takes her top off and you know,

2239
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:19,910
she's a feminist almost immediately 
after she takes her top off.

2240
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:25,210
This dude is black guys think,
I don't know why I have to say black 

2241
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:25,210
guy,
but it's headed to there.

2242
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:25,210
Brazen.
When they hit on,

2243
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:27,050
girls sneaks behind her and grabbed her 
tits.

2244
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:28,410
No behind.
Yes.

2245
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:33,640
Yes.
And she screaMs at him and they scream 

2246
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:33,640
at them and they blurred the black guy's
face out,

2247
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:38,021
whIch is kind of funny,
but they didn't blow the titties outta 

2248
01:36:38,021 --> 01:36:38,021
that.

2249
01:36:38,021 --> 01:36:38,021
Didn't blow them titties out.
Interesting.

2250
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:40,400
That's very racist.
So the black guy's face,

2251
01:36:40,401 --> 01:36:43,970
but not the titties,
because whoever doesn't want that guy to

2252
01:36:43,971 --> 01:36:45,860
get implicated in a crime,
it's.

2253
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:48,680
I mean,
even though he just found it.

2254
01:36:48,681 --> 01:36:49,910
Yeah,
I want to see it here.

2255
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:52,010
Watch this.
So she's yelling at this dude.

2256
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:55,310
So she's yelling and she takes her top 
off.

2257
01:36:55,311 --> 01:36:57,200
Look,
see your full full breasts.

2258
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,060
Now watch this dude with the blurred out
face.

2259
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:00,860
He comes up behind it.
Oh shit.

2260
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:03,360
Oh wow.
Everybody's like,

2261
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:04,910
no,
no,

2262
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:08,180
you do not.
You do not do that.

2263
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:10,160
And they,
they even lose track of him.

2264
01:37:10,190 --> 01:37:13,220
He sort of lingering in the background 
there in fighting with each other.

2265
01:37:13,221 --> 01:37:14,990
Now tim,
he was so confused.

2266
01:37:14,991 --> 01:37:16,540
I got to tell you,
he was smooth as fuck away.

2267
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:17,420
Did that shit?
Well,

2268
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,040
he's probably met girls like that 
before.

2269
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:20,400
Next thing you know,
old jeddah,

2270
01:37:20,401 --> 01:37:22,930
Millionaire gobble,
gobble switches.

2271
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:30,810
And she's like pointing her finger at 
him like he was using the body's 

2272
01:37:30,810 --> 01:37:34,100
natural.
but what are they arguing about?

2273
01:37:34,101 --> 01:37:36,110
What the fuck's going on here?
Who cares?

2274
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,330
They're arguing because they were poorly
parented.

2275
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:43,550
They never learned how to phone.
The whole thing's ridiculous.

2276
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:47,060
These are just people today,
people losing their fucking minds.

2277
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:52,270
This is the shit that they will play for
future generations when they talk about 

2278
01:37:52,270 --> 01:37:56,021
the downfall of modern western society,
they'll play this kind of shit when 

2279
01:37:56,021 --> 01:37:56,070
young kids

2280
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:59,780
were just so soft and living a life so 
easy.

2281
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:04,800
Look for microaggressions at every turn 
and then also girls puller to these are 

2282
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:07,380
guys grabbed him because that's what 
some dudes do.

2283
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:12,930
You know,
you can't just pull your titties out in 

2284
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:12,930
front of soMe dudes that girls still 
walking around with their titties out,

2285
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:13,170
right?
yeah,

2286
01:38:13,171 --> 01:38:13,560
yeah.
Yeah.

2287
01:38:13,561 --> 01:38:14,250
I think so.
Yeah.

2288
01:38:14,251 --> 01:38:15,690
Super impressive.
So far,

2289
01:38:15,691 --> 01:38:17,540
only one grab.
Yeah.

2290
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:22,550
That's amazIng so far,
but that's just because there's always 

2291
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:24,740
other people around.
Realize the danger people will make act 

2292
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:26,670
different.
Isn't that the thing in New York city?

2293
01:38:26,671 --> 01:38:28,350
You can walk out with your.
I think you can.

2294
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:33,420
They had a gender thing.
You can walk around with top of the 

2295
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:33,420
shirts off.
Women don't.

2296
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:34,080
Most places.
Most places for women.

2297
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:39,081
Yeah.
Where do you think it's illegal to go 

2298
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:39,081
topless?
If you had to guess.

2299
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:39,480
Well you can't do it in la.
Wouldn't be funny if it was vegas.

2300
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:43,140
Can't do it in la.
I don't think so.

2301
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:45,360
Hmm.
I wonder if you can.

2302
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:50,130
I mean if they can,
they can breastfeed so they can.

2303
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:55,160
But that's different.
It's like a guy can pretty much 

2304
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:55,160
everywhere.
Everywhere.

2305
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:59,280
Plus yeah.
I can walk down the street wondering 

2306
01:38:59,280 --> 01:38:59,280
what like if there's a certain time at 
night with arrest you,

2307
01:38:59,570 --> 01:39:04,570
like if you're.
If you have no shirt on and it's 

2308
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:04,570
midnight in la.
Yeah.

2309
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:04,570
The cop might arrest you.
I'm like,

2310
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:04,920
dude,
what are you doing?

2311
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,540
Like why don't you have a shirt on?
Right.

2312
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:09,180
But if it's like noon and you have no 
shirt on,

2313
01:39:09,390 --> 01:39:10,320
you're sunbathing.
Yeah.

2314
01:39:10,321 --> 01:39:12,000
You just hanging out.
Just trying to catch some rays.

2315
01:39:12,001 --> 01:39:12,870
This is chili dude.

2316
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:17,550
But if it's like 7:00
AM,

2317
01:39:17,551 --> 01:39:19,560
like what's this derelict dealing with 
no shirt.

2318
01:39:19,561 --> 01:39:21,900
They would definitely keep an eye on you
unless you're jogging.

2319
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:23,910
Then you're like,
this guy's an athlete too.

2320
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:26,250
That's really funny.
That's like a carlin bitter some shit.

2321
01:39:26,251 --> 01:39:31,251
Probably a certain amount of time to 
have a shirt off at 7:00

2322
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:33,380
AM.
Yeah.

2323
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,660
As long as yo running.
Yeah.

2324
01:39:34,661 --> 01:39:35,910
It's.
If it's 5:00

2325
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:37,590
AM,
you probably should put a hoodie on just

2326
01:39:37,591 --> 01:39:40,470
to let people know you're serious 
because if you have no shirt on at 5:00

2327
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:45,470
AM,
like did you just have no shirt on and 

2328
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:46,881
start running?
If you're running with no shirt on a 

2329
01:39:46,881 --> 01:39:46,881
5:00
AM,

2330
01:39:46,881 --> 01:39:46,881
someone's chasing you.
Yeah.

2331
01:39:46,881 --> 01:39:51,150
And probably running at 5:00
AM and keep running to 7:30.

2332
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:53,360
If someone sees you at 7:30,
they assume you just started.

2333
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:56,580
Didn't assume you've been running sinCe 
like left the club.

2334
01:39:56,581 --> 01:40:00,590
Right.
So basically we'll try to marathon right

2335
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:04,830
out of sobering up as you're running.
I looked down at his shoes.

2336
01:40:04,831 --> 01:40:09,831
He's got fucking loafers on what is 
going on here is the got is brighton 

2337
01:40:09,831 --> 01:40:11,220
drink ticket?
Racialist is.

2338
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:16,350
I showed my id bracelet and then he 
still has his sunglasses on from last 

2339
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:16,800
night to be cool.
But now they're functional.

2340
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:22,890
That's so perfect.
That was good.

2341
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:24,900
Had the what?
A douche.

2342
01:40:24,901 --> 01:40:27,060
Move wearing sunglasses outside at 
night.

2343
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:29,160
Nothing worse bro.
Fashion wise,

2344
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:30,230
nothing worse.
It is.

2345
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:31,310
So douchey.
Yeah.

2346
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:33,150
And black gUys can pull it off so much 
better than.

2347
01:40:33,151 --> 01:40:33,720
Well of course.
Yeah.

2348
01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:37,080
I'm not even offended when I see a black
guy at a basketball game.

2349
01:40:37,081 --> 01:40:40,060
If he's like ll cool j and he's got 
sunglasses on,

2350
01:40:40,061 --> 01:40:41,850
this bothers me.
It doesn't bother me,

2351
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:46,210
but if it's a white guy like take those 
fucking things off you.

2352
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:50,400
It doesn't matter the race to racist 
when it comes to sunglasses.

2353
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:54,910
When it comes to sunglasses white here,
you're fucking real racist against white

2354
01:40:54,911 --> 01:40:59,911
dudes.
You've always been racist against white 

2355
01:40:59,911 --> 01:41:02,431
dudes.
White dudes and sunglasses and like he 

2356
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:02,431
nef.
Yeah,

2357
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:07,080
it's dark out.
You could see fine if you're doing tv 

2358
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:11,011
shows and shit.
you know what do you sit on the tycho 

2359
01:41:11,011 --> 01:41:11,011
and they have a sunglasses.

2360
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:12,460
I,
yeah,

2361
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:13,990
I've seen people do that.
Yeah,

2362
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,930
sunglasses on.
Tough crowd.

2363
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:22,620
He did a show about comedians.
That's ballsy.

2364
01:41:22,781 --> 01:41:23,980
Dude.
Didn't work out well.

2365
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,120
Would they made fun of him,
rIght?

2366
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:30,150
Well greg geraldo shit all over him 
because they were going back and forth 

2367
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:30,640
and every time greg would say something 
funny,

2368
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:33,100
dennis would like mock the fact that he 
was saying something funny.

2369
01:41:33,101 --> 01:41:34,150
It was.
He never seen this.

2370
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:39,210
No.
It's one of the weirdest interactions 

2371
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:39,210
between two comedians ever.
It's very odd.

2372
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:40,520
Yeah.
Between geraldo and lyric.

2373
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:42,340
Oh man.
A classic.

2374
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:44,310
I gotta to watch.
Yeah.

2375
01:41:44,311 --> 01:41:45,180
No,
that's weirdly.

2376
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:47,030
Or we will get yang yang,
right?

2377
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:49,810
Probably right.
Has that anymore?

2378
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:50,890
That show was funny,
man.

2379
01:41:50,891 --> 01:41:52,810
It's fucking great.
Did you do it?

2380
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:54,760
Yeah,
I think I did it twice.

2381
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:59,470
It was great fun show colin quinn's 
shit.

2382
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:01,820
Yeah,
it was just a great idea.

2383
01:42:01,821 --> 01:42:04,210
I mean he's basically like a podcast on 
comedy central.

2384
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:05,230
It was before podcasts,
right?

2385
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:08,080
I mean it really was kind of in some 
ways like.

2386
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:09,660
Well the,
I think the original podcast,

2387
01:42:09,661 --> 01:42:14,661
the stern show,
and then once the stern show went to 

2388
01:42:14,661 --> 01:42:17,251
satellite radio,
then it became an uncensored and then 

2389
01:42:17,251 --> 01:42:18,310
opie and anthony sort of.
Same thing,

2390
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:23,580
but I'll open anthony even more like a 
podcast because you just shoot the shit 

2391
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:25,990
and then tough crowd came along and now 
it's on comedy central.

2392
01:42:25,991 --> 01:42:27,580
I have no idea why they stopped doing 
that.

2393
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:29,170
Must have been a.
Because that was.

2394
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:30,630
It wasn't.
It was kind of short lift.

2395
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:31,660
Oh,
was it?

2396
01:42:31,690 --> 01:42:33,550
I thought it was.
Maybe not.

2397
01:42:33,551 --> 01:42:34,480
Maybe not.
Maybe there's a few.

2398
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:37,120
Maybe was like four or five.
Colin quinn's and interesting dude,

2399
01:42:37,121 --> 01:42:39,570
he might've just got tired of doing it.
I meT him in,

2400
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:42,670
um,
where the fuck was I?

2401
01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:47,730
Vancouver actually that night I did my 
special afterwards and he was just the 

2402
01:42:47,730 --> 01:42:47,950
nicest guy,
man.

2403
01:42:47,950 --> 01:42:51,610
My dad loves him and he was like,
can I be colin quinn?

2404
01:42:51,611 --> 01:42:52,390
And I was like,
yeah,

2405
01:42:52,391 --> 01:42:55,030
like my dad never.
so I got a picture of them two together.

2406
01:42:55,031 --> 01:42:56,740
It was like a really sweet fucking night
would call him.

2407
01:42:56,741 --> 01:42:57,850
Was the nicest.
He's a,

2408
01:42:57,910 --> 01:43:02,910
he is one of my best examples that I 
personally use when I say you have to 

2409
01:43:02,951 --> 01:43:07,951
see someone to stand up in the flash,
live in the flesh to understand how 

2410
01:43:07,951 --> 01:43:09,810
funny they're like.
He's one of those guys,

2411
01:43:09,811 --> 01:43:12,820
just him because his act is so.
It's so absurd.

2412
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:17,920
It's so silly and odd.
Like you almost have to see him live and

2413
01:43:17,921 --> 01:43:20,680
then you want to see a long set,
you want to say like a headline set.

2414
01:43:20,681 --> 01:43:25,681
We see it filled up and get weirder.
Well he got a lot of attention for the 

2415
01:43:25,681 --> 01:43:25,681
last specialty you did.
I know.

2416
01:43:25,870 --> 01:43:26,580
He's funny,
man.

2417
01:43:26,590 --> 01:43:28,510
It's a funny fucking dude.
He's always been funny,

2418
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:31,510
but that show was a great show.
How long was it on for jamie?

2419
01:43:31,590 --> 01:43:34,120
Over?
Just under two years to see.

2420
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:40,140
Wow.
I would've thought it was like four 

2421
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:40,140
years.
Wow.

2422
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:40,750
That'd be a cool show to do.
Well,

2423
01:43:40,751 --> 01:43:42,730
what the fuck happened?
Is there a wikipedia and that?

2424
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:46,000
She must've been.
How is it not a hit?

2425
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:48,400
Maybe it was just too many shows back 
then.

2426
01:43:48,401 --> 01:43:49,940
They were like a lot of shows though.
Yeah,

2427
01:43:50,270 --> 01:43:52,010
and like pits too.
I

2428
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:54,320
feel like.
I guess there's more shows now than ever

2429
01:43:54,321 --> 01:43:54,800
though.
Right?

2430
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:59,860
Well,
but only because of probably the 

2431
01:43:59,860 --> 01:43:59,860
internet and shit,
but there's too many channels.

2432
01:43:59,860 --> 01:44:01,430
Like when you found out something that's
not true tv,

2433
01:44:01,431 --> 01:44:02,240
like wait,
what?

2434
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:03,470
Right.
Or is that right?

2435
01:44:03,471 --> 01:44:03,730
Right,
right.

2436
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:05,090
How do we even find them in?
I know.

2437
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,560
What is that the,
the tv land channel.

2438
01:44:07,630 --> 01:44:11,660
Do you watch tv?
You don't watch netflix and hbo.

2439
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:14,870
Right.
And occasionally I watch hunting shows.

2440
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:16,100
Right.
What do we got here?

2441
01:44:16,101 --> 01:44:17,910
What does it say?
Does it say why it,

2442
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:22,930
why it ended up notes from comedy 
central at the same time the chappelle 

2443
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:22,930
show was on and.
Oh,

2444
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:24,750
no demographic.
I don't know.

2445
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:25,970
Oh,
so they fucked it up.

2446
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:28,940
The executives fucked it up.
How we went and wrote a blog about it.

2447
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,020
Oh,
okay.

2448
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,850
Makes sense.
Executive fucked it up.

2449
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:37,810
The last show contained a monologue by 
quinn's who attacked his distractors,

2450
01:44:38,410 --> 01:44:43,410
uh,
such as the New York times for being 

2451
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:43,670
hypocritical and elitist for their 
negative reviews.

2452
01:44:43,670 --> 01:44:48,670
He also defined comedic integrity is the
ability to critique the hypocrisy of 

2453
01:44:49,011 --> 01:44:54,011
society.
But to be honest enough to admit that 

2454
01:44:54,011 --> 01:44:57,170
you are just as guilty of it as anyone 
else.

2455
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,870
Yeah.
Well they fucked up.

2456
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:05,010
That was a great show and it could have 
been an amazing show,

2457
01:45:05,011 --> 01:45:06,230
but they just bring it back.
Bring it back.

2458
01:45:06,231 --> 01:45:08,840
Comedy central.
You need to hit cancel the show.

2459
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:14,350
And also also you can just make a.
Well he probably didn't want to do it 

2460
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:14,350
now,
but yeah.

2461
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:19,510
Well it's just weird man.
They like got rid of moshe kasher shaw 

2462
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:19,510
already.
I did.

2463
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:23,630
I heard.
Might have fucking jumped the gun on 

2464
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:23,630
that one too.
I think actually,

2465
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:24,110
I don't think they.
This is what I think.

2466
01:45:24,111 --> 01:45:26,720
I think it was like somebody else's show
and that exec,

2467
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:30,260
whoever was running things is gone.
Oh yeah.

2468
01:45:30,261 --> 01:45:31,880
That shIt is be talking shit.

2469
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:33,920
I don't know anything about show 
business anymore.

2470
01:45:33,921 --> 01:45:37,340
I'm barely in show business.
I'm a non showbiz entity.

2471
01:45:37,460 --> 01:45:42,460
I have no idea what's going on except of
getting fired from comedy central with 

2472
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:43,890
the show.
The story telling you.

2473
01:45:45,310 --> 01:45:47,330
Well maybe you're wrong.
No,

2474
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:48,860
he's definitely not nine.
I'm just saying.

2475
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:50,930
Did you do that show you were.
No,

2476
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:51,890
no,
this is not happening.

2477
01:45:51,891 --> 01:45:53,870
He always asks me to do it and I always 
wanted to do it,

2478
01:45:53,871 --> 01:45:56,630
but I never had a story that fit the 
theme and then I was just like,

2479
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:58,940
I don't know how to do it and I just 
never ended up doing it.

2480
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,620
That's the problem.
I think it's a great.

2481
01:46:00,621 --> 01:46:02,930
I think it's a great fucking awesome 
idea.

2482
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:05,510
It's a.
It's a show designed for joey diaz.

2483
01:46:05,810 --> 01:46:10,810
Yeah,
because joey diaz has more stories than 

2484
01:46:10,810 --> 01:46:10,810
any human being that's ever walked the 
face of the planet.

2485
01:46:10,810 --> 01:46:10,870
Yeah,
yeah,

2486
01:46:11,210 --> 01:46:13,340
yeah.
But he was special.

2487
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:16,240
He is out.
Oh,

2488
01:46:16,290 --> 01:46:18,440
you excited man on fire?
I am,

2489
01:46:18,441 --> 01:46:19,490
yeah.
No,

2490
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,470
the brazen attempt to craft a new hour,
you know?

2491
01:46:23,410 --> 01:46:23,930
Oh yeah.
It's like,

2492
01:46:23,931 --> 01:46:28,931
You know,
when you start a new one and then it's 

2493
01:46:28,931 --> 01:46:28,931
like I have like 25 new minutes and I'm 
like,

2494
01:46:28,931 --> 01:46:30,620
is this stuff really though going to be 
in my hour?

2495
01:46:30,621 --> 01:46:32,420
I don't know what I mean.
Yeah.

2496
01:46:32,421 --> 01:46:33,770
You don't even know gettIng,
you don't know.

2497
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:37,760
Do you write down physically do right.
Physically never.

2498
01:46:37,761 --> 01:46:40,490
And I know it's a good idea to do that.
I just,

2499
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:41,240
it's,
it's,

2500
01:46:41,570 --> 01:46:46,570
it's so much less.
It's so much more work for me to know 

2501
01:46:46,570 --> 01:46:49,560
what I'm going to say and get up there 
and it

2502
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:55,070
than it is to go up with an idea and 
work it out on stage and I have so much 

2503
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:55,330
more fun doing that,
you know?

2504
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:58,380
And,
and for me,

2505
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:00,060
I,
you know,

2506
01:47:00,850 --> 01:47:02,940
I,
I like am able to,

2507
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:08,060
not to get too heady but like explore 
that bit way more onstage because I 

2508
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:11,070
fucking have to in that moment.
Because you're trapped.

2509
01:47:11,071 --> 01:47:13,980
Yeah.
There's 250 people there for seven.

2510
01:47:13,981 --> 01:47:15,210
Even if there's a few.
But like,

2511
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,040
um,
yeah,

2512
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:19,030
I just liked doing that and that's how I
get,

2513
01:47:19,031 --> 01:47:21,120
like,
I get like I have really long bits,

2514
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:22,990
you know.
So that's how,

2515
01:47:23,070 --> 01:47:25,050
that's how that happens.
A lot of people do.

2516
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:30,070
I mean everyBody's got their own style.
I think the only thing that's really 

2517
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:31,770
consistent is that you need to pay 
attention to it.

2518
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:33,670
You can do like really focused on stand 
up.

2519
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:34,980
Oh yeah.
That's the only thing.

2520
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:39,980
That's really how you do it.
Like whether you do it like in your car 

2521
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:43,911
while you're driving,
you shut the radio off and just think 

2522
01:47:43,911 --> 01:47:46,251
about it.
But whether you do it in front of a 

2523
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:46,251
computer or whether you,
you know,

2524
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:47,040
whatever,
whatever you do or you do a lot of sets,

2525
01:47:47,041 --> 01:47:49,980
you do a set of the improv instead of 
the store and the set of the factory.

2526
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:53,100
It's all just about how much,
how much energy,

2527
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:55,320
how much focus put on it.
Well,

2528
01:47:55,321 --> 01:47:56,220
yeah,
because if you think about it,

2529
01:47:56,221 --> 01:48:01,221
really the only time,
the amount of time that you're actually 

2530
01:48:01,221 --> 01:48:01,221
doing standup.
Yeah.

2531
01:48:01,221 --> 01:48:02,880
An hour and a half at night.
Unless you doing two sets a night,

2532
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:04,560
you know,
that's why weekends are so good.

2533
01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:06,340
Right.
You get to do two on friday,

2534
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,530
two on saturday and do an improv 
somewhere or something.

2535
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:12,210
But then like I came up with a new bit 
two weeks ago.

2536
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:15,500
That's like a six minute bit.
Oh and,

2537
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:16,290
but it's,
you know,

2538
01:48:16,291 --> 01:48:21,291
it's fun finding.
I know something happened and now I'm 

2539
01:48:21,291 --> 01:48:23,940
talking about us.
The universe opened up an idea for you.

2540
01:48:23,941 --> 01:48:25,050
I know,
I know.

2541
01:48:25,051 --> 01:48:26,450
It's so awesome when that happens.
Right.

2542
01:48:26,610 --> 01:48:31,610
And then so I've been working it but 
I've only been really working it on the 

2543
01:48:31,610 --> 01:48:32,520
road so I in my head I'm like,
I have to get to the comedy store to see

2544
01:48:32,521 --> 01:48:33,940
if it actually works.
Right.

2545
01:48:33,950 --> 01:48:34,710
You got it.
That's how I feel.

2546
01:48:34,711 --> 01:48:35,880
Oh,
on tuesday night.

2547
01:48:35,881 --> 01:48:36,800
Yeah.
Yeah,

2548
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:41,810
the oh,
on tuesday nights a perfect defining my 

2549
01:48:41,810 --> 01:48:41,810
percent Because people are like,
first of all,

2550
01:48:41,810 --> 01:48:44,230
it's still tired cocaine,
they did on saturday.

2551
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:46,070
They're there,
they're there.

2552
01:48:46,071 --> 01:48:50,250
They're unimpressed waiting to see if 
they pass the audition.

2553
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:54,090
One hundred percent or a lot of them are
fucking russian.

2554
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:57,450
You know what I mean?
Just a lot of people have been flying to

2555
01:48:57,451 --> 01:48:58,890
the store.
Why wouldn't they?

2556
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:00,960
Just to check out the line to why 
wouldn't they?

2557
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:03,690
Yeah.
Those lineups are fucking unbelievable.

2558
01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:04,620
It's crazy,
right?

2559
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:06,090
Yeah.
It's kind of confusing.

2560
01:49:06,330 --> 01:49:08,520
It is confusing.
I remember how it used to be.

2561
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:09,450
Yes.

2562
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:14,580
When I first got there,
nobody was.

2563
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,920
Was hit.
They were doing well,

2564
01:49:17,310 --> 01:49:19,170
but they,
they would do well on stage,

2565
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:24,230
but nobody knew who they were.
We got to show more love to the laugh 

2566
01:49:24,230 --> 01:49:26,751
factory.
We've got to keep that fucking place 

2567
01:49:26,751 --> 01:49:26,751
alive.
It will be alive.

2568
01:49:26,751 --> 01:49:26,751
Yeah.
I mean I,

2569
01:49:26,751 --> 01:49:27,360
I like going there.
I go to.

2570
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:29,150
I'm there wednesday,
wednesday night meeting.

2571
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:30,060
We'll plug.
Oh,

2572
01:49:30,061 --> 01:49:30,650
that's right.
Yeah.

2573
01:49:30,860 --> 01:49:33,060
Ten pm.
Wednesday you,

2574
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:34,210
kristen,
leah.

2575
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:38,860
Who else was on that show?
I don't know.

2576
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:40,920
It's a good show though.
A lot.

2577
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:42,270
A lot of fine people.
Yeah.

2578
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:46,020
What else going on?
I think I have a pitch up.

2579
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:46,970
Should we keep going?
I don't.

2580
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:47,860
That's up to you,
man.

2581
01:49:47,870 --> 01:49:49,330
Huh?
How long have we been doing it anyway?

2582
01:49:49,331 --> 01:49:50,510
Two hours.
Really?

2583
01:49:50,511 --> 01:49:52,140
That wasn't quick.
Come on dubar.

2584
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:53,040
Fuck.
What are we?

2585
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:57,860
Professional talk knows what we.
What we do bro.

2586
01:49:58,450 --> 01:50:00,850
Fucking allows.
As I was saying,

2587
01:50:00,851 --> 01:50:04,870
it is good to come back because when I 
first did the first one I fucking barely

2588
01:50:04,871 --> 01:50:07,690
knew you and I was intimidated and now 
at least we're friends and shit.

2589
01:50:08,190 --> 01:50:10,060
Then the baby jesus,
we could just bullshit,

2590
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:13,030
but I still get people that are like,
hey man,

2591
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:16,510
sewing on rogan and I'm like,
jesus christ.

2592
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:21,540
That's fucking awesome.
Do you ever think when a guy's talking 

2593
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:21,540
to you like that,
they're really just doesn't know what to

2594
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:21,540
say and he really wants to blow you.

2595
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:27,640
Maybe actually explains a lot what 
happened afterwards?

2596
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:31,170
Like,
hey girl,

2597
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:34,240
hey,
I saw you on two broke girls.

2598
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:39,810
Fucking funny.
I would love if you did an episode of 

2599
01:50:39,810 --> 01:50:39,810
two broke girls by the way.
I would do it.

2600
01:50:39,810 --> 01:50:40,090
That's whitney show.
Well,

2601
01:50:40,091 --> 01:50:42,130
it's not on anymore,
but uh,

2602
01:50:42,190 --> 01:50:47,190
you know,
it literally got canceled like two 

2603
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:47,190
months ago maybe.
What was it like?

2604
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:49,270
I don't even know what it was about two 
broke girls bro.

2605
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,780
But why would it be funny if I did an 
episode two?

2606
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:53,560
Because why the fuck you would never do 
that?

2607
01:50:54,370 --> 01:50:56,620
What do you mean?
Be like joe rogan did that.

2608
01:50:56,621 --> 01:50:58,390
Why?
For goof?

2609
01:50:58,570 --> 01:50:59,680
Yeah,
I'd do it for whitney.

2610
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:00,420
Yeah.
Yeah,

2611
01:51:00,421 --> 01:51:02,320
he would.
But then you still tight with her?

2612
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:03,100
Yeah,
she's great.

2613
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:06,670
But that then you should do the not,
not you should,

2614
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:09,430
you should ask your agent.
You don't even have one right?

2615
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:10,660
I haven't eaten.
Okay.

2616
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:13,360
So you should ask your agent.
You one of those guys would be like,

2617
01:51:13,361 --> 01:51:13,990
nah,
fuck agents.

2618
01:51:14,030 --> 01:51:18,430
I still get rid of one eventually.
So you should ask your agent to find one

2619
01:51:18,431 --> 01:51:23,431
episode to do one.
Like I would love it if you did one 

2620
01:51:23,431 --> 01:51:24,050
episode of csi,
like the,

2621
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:28,150
the new orleans one,
like not even the one that's like,

2622
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:30,730
you know what I mean?
Not even like the one but like,

2623
01:51:31,030 --> 01:51:34,840
but one episode in like three scenes.
That'd be fucking hilarious.

2624
01:51:35,170 --> 01:51:36,640
Being interrogated,
interrogated,

2625
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:42,370
and not even like promote it and then be
like,

2626
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:45,220
what the fuck is joe rogan doing?
And you're like,

2627
01:51:45,221 --> 01:51:46,220
I don't know where I,
you know,

2628
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:47,590
I didn't mean to.
I hit her too hard,

2629
01:51:47,591 --> 01:51:48,050
you know,
like,

2630
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:53,940
be fucking hilarious.
How many of those fucking crime shows 

2631
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:56,140
can they have one point of time the 
network executives go,

2632
01:51:56,490 --> 01:51:57,100
we got to stop.

2633
01:51:57,130 --> 01:51:58,690
I don't know.
I don't know.

2634
01:51:58,870 --> 01:52:01,810
I don't know.
On believable.

2635
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,470
When did we get this murder fetish?
This,

2636
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:07,390
this fucking crime scene.
Investigation fetish.

2637
01:52:07,810 --> 01:52:09,580
The only ones I like are the forensic 
files,

2638
01:52:09,581 --> 01:52:11,730
the ones where they reenact it and they.
And they show.

2639
01:52:11,870 --> 01:52:13,210
Yeah.
Those are real stories.

2640
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:18,240
I watched so many of those when marvin 
hutchinson came home early evening to 

2641
01:52:19,541 --> 01:52:22,720
find his girlfriend in bed with his 
brother.

2642
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:27,780
Yeah,
just always arrest the spouse because 

2643
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:28,240
it's them always.
And they always go to like the,

2644
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:32,740
the most extreme lengths where it's like
just arrest that person and then check.

2645
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:35,530
Sometimes it's the creepy guy at work 
that's in love with a woman,

2646
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:37,930
but very rarely.
Yeah,

2647
01:52:37,931 --> 01:52:38,950
you're right.
But,

2648
01:52:38,951 --> 01:52:40,990
but,
but those,

2649
01:52:40,991 --> 01:52:43,030
I've,
I've watched so much forensic because by

2650
01:52:43,031 --> 01:52:45,890
the way,
when you're on the road hln the network,

2651
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,450
it's just forensic files all day long.
Yeah.

2652
01:52:48,450 --> 01:52:50,120
It's like.
And then nancy grace for an hour.

2653
01:52:50,210 --> 01:52:51,920
What did it used to be?
Headline news.

2654
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:53,450
I don't know.
I guess.

2655
01:52:53,451 --> 01:52:58,451
Is that what that stands for?
Because they give up on whatever this 

2656
01:52:58,451 --> 01:52:58,451
format is.
Like country music,

2657
01:52:58,451 --> 01:53:02,501
television.
We're going to do fucking drag races 

2658
01:53:02,501 --> 01:53:06,401
now.
We're going to have a bass fishing 

2659
01:53:06,401 --> 01:53:06,401
competition.
What?

2660
01:53:06,401 --> 01:53:07,110
Wait a minute.
I thought you were guitar.

2661
01:53:07,370 --> 01:53:07,720
No,
no,

2662
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:09,830
no.
I'm going to give josh wolfe a show.

2663
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:13,180
But he's not a country guy.
Yeah.

2664
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:18,260
Uh,
I've watched so much of that that all 

2665
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:18,530
see the same murder on the different 
episodes,

2666
01:53:18,531 --> 01:53:23,531
like forensic files.
We'll do it and then I'll be watching 

2667
01:53:23,531 --> 01:53:23,531
snap and I'll be like,
oh,

2668
01:53:23,531 --> 01:53:23,531
I saw this one on forensic files.
We'll get different reason.

2669
01:53:23,531 --> 01:53:25,850
They all have their own reenactment of 
that because it's the new.

2670
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:27,070
Because this topic,
it's like,

2671
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:29,000
it's not their subject.
It's not like they wrote it.

2672
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:29,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

2673
01:53:29,841 --> 01:53:32,600
They have to allow another guy to do 
another recreation.

2674
01:53:32,930 --> 01:53:37,930
They probably cheat like gold,
like what'd you get some of your 

2675
01:53:37,930 --> 01:53:38,030
footage?
Well,

2676
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:39,940
they did that with.
I don't like the angle they,

2677
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:41,180
yeah,
show the murder.

2678
01:53:41,210 --> 01:53:44,390
Like there's a really good one.
There's a really good one on,

2679
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:47,960
I don't know what child part of the id 
channel,

2680
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:52,990
but uh,
see no evil and they go through like 

2681
01:53:52,990 --> 01:53:53,670
with forensic files,
all they do is um,

2682
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:59,240
they,
they work out who did the crime with 

2683
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:01,301
forensics,
but on this one they find out who did 

2684
01:54:01,301 --> 01:54:01,301
the crime only using the security 
footage.

2685
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:06,520
And it's really creepy and really 
interesting because like you'll see a 

2686
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:10,421
guy walk into the elevator and then 
leave with a briefcase and shit or like 

2687
01:54:10,421 --> 01:54:11,120
a suitcase and the bodies in there and 
you're like,

2688
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:16,150
oh,
it's really great because it's real 

2689
01:54:16,150 --> 01:54:16,150
footage.

2690
01:54:16,150 --> 01:54:17,750
Yeah.
See no evil when you see a real body,

2691
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:21,590
even if it's through a security camera,
so clubs somebody over the head and drag

2692
01:54:21,591 --> 01:54:22,470
them backwards.
Like,

2693
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,870
whew,
that's a real body man.

2694
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:30,220
Like what I don't understand is I like 
heat of the moment.

2695
01:54:30,741 --> 01:54:35,741
Murderers.
I guess I can wrap my head around 

2696
01:54:35,741 --> 01:54:35,750
because it's like you just got so mad at
the person and it happened,

2697
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:39,320
but like to plan it and,
and think,

2698
01:54:39,470 --> 01:54:44,470
oh good,
I'm going to make 20 grand off this or 

2699
01:54:44,470 --> 01:54:46,631
the for the life insurance and to think 
you're not going to get caught is like 

2700
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:50,020
you're going to get caught.
Yeah.

2701
01:54:50,090 --> 01:54:52,190
People get caught,
but people are stupid as fuck.

2702
01:54:52,191 --> 01:54:57,191
Dude.
There's a lot of people out there that 

2703
01:54:57,191 --> 01:54:59,180
lie so much that they don't have a 
connection to reality.

2704
01:54:59,190 --> 01:55:04,190
Yeah.
They've severed their tether to reality 

2705
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:07,510
so they think they can bullshit people 
all the time and they think that they 

2706
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:09,590
can sort of con artists people all the 
time.

2707
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:10,880
I knew a guy like that.
Brian kelly.

2708
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:11,820
No,
I'm kidding.

2709
01:55:11,830 --> 01:55:12,890
I'm kidding with you.
I'm completely crazy.

2710
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:16,580
This guy was a fake brazilian jujitsu 
black belt.

2711
01:55:16,930 --> 01:55:19,630
What have been fake fake wasn't really a
brazilian jujitsu black belt.

2712
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:24,670
Told everybody he was.
And this is the early days of brazilian 

2713
01:55:24,670 --> 01:55:24,920
jiu jitsu black belt where there weren't
a lot of them,

2714
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:28,850
so you could almost kind of get away 
with it like people didn't know.

2715
01:55:28,851 --> 01:55:29,880
And then he said like,
oh,

2716
01:55:29,881 --> 01:55:32,350
it was like a japanese jujitsu brazilian
does.

2717
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:34,340
I'm not really like a black belt.
Black belt.

2718
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:40,680
Change his name,
I forget his real name was because he 

2719
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:40,680
got caught.
No,

2720
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:40,680
no,
no.

2721
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:42,740
Oh me a fake name.
And a fake brazilian name.

2722
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:43,760
Be a pro

2723
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:46,050
referral.
Tory close.

2724
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:51,080
So he was friends with eddie and he was 
banging this married chick and killed 

2725
01:55:52,831 --> 01:55:57,831
her husband,
brought them to the gym and strangled 

2726
01:55:57,831 --> 01:55:58,440
her.
Killed her,

2727
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:00,720
killed him,
brother killed him.

2728
01:56:00,810 --> 01:56:02,610
So I say her,
I didn't say fake black belt.

2729
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:07,760
He killed the fake black belt,
killed the husband of the wife that he 

2730
01:56:08,011 --> 01:56:13,011
was banging and killed him and then got 
caught and he tried to get this other 

2731
01:56:15,271 --> 01:56:18,030
dude that I know that it's an mma 
fighter to try to get him to kill him.

2732
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:23,540
I Tried to offer them some money and he 
was driving the dude's car round after 

2733
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:23,550
he killed him.
What a micron do.

2734
01:56:23,551 --> 01:56:28,551
Drove the dudes got seen driving the 
guy's car in a small town after he 

2735
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:31,410
killed him.
Yeah.

2736
01:56:31,411 --> 01:56:34,950
So he's in jail now,
but he went to the woods and,

2737
01:56:34,951 --> 01:56:35,880
uh,
with,

2738
01:56:35,900 --> 01:56:36,900
uh,
a bag,

2739
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:40,050
like a big ass fucking duffle bag and 
told his friend,

2740
01:56:40,051 --> 01:56:41,130
hey man,
drop me off.

2741
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:45,660
I'm gOing to a secret no rules.
Kuma tay karate tournament in the woods.

2742
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:47,250
And his friend's like,
oh,

2743
01:56:47,251 --> 01:56:52,251
okay.
So this fucking dude goes into the 

2744
01:56:52,251 --> 01:56:52,251
woods.
Okay.

2745
01:56:52,251 --> 01:56:55,880
WIth a bag,
with a bag that like you would fit a 

2746
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:57,720
trophy in uk.
Comes ouT of the woods the next day with

2747
01:56:57,721 --> 01:57:01,500
a trophy.
So he opens the bag,

2748
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:03,720
pulls his fucking trophy out and says,
hey man,

2749
01:57:03,721 --> 01:57:05,250
I want this karate tournament in the 
world.

2750
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:09,190
Oh my god,
this guy is insane.

2751
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:10,000
That's.
I mean,

2752
01:57:10,010 --> 01:57:12,420
he's literally,
he's in jail for being insane.

2753
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:15,420
Yeah,
dude.

2754
01:57:15,421 --> 01:57:20,421
He went.
He could put a fucking trophy in the 

2755
01:57:20,421 --> 01:57:22,611
bags.
Like no one's gonna suspect this to 

2756
01:57:22,611 --> 01:57:22,611
totally gonna.
Forget about this.

2757
01:57:22,611 --> 01:57:22,611
That's one of those.
Yeah,

2758
01:57:22,611 --> 01:57:24,000
that's what it was like.
This is so crazy.

2759
01:57:24,001 --> 01:57:25,390
There's no,
no one's going to believe it.

2760
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:27,930
Everyone's going to believe it because 
why the fuck would I make it up?

2761
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:29,880
He says,
drop me off in the woods,

2762
01:57:29,881 --> 01:57:32,250
bro.
Because secret karate in the woods.

2763
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:34,300
This is back in the day.
like so.

2764
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:39,310
What did You said in the early nineties?
And he just leaves that out in the 

2765
01:57:39,310 --> 01:57:39,310
woods.
Probably camped paleo.

2766
01:57:39,310 --> 01:57:43,970
Maybe this trophy.
Just a bunch of all the noodles.

2767
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:45,750
Can't wait to show this to my friend.
Oh,

2768
01:57:45,751 --> 01:57:47,320
it's a famous story.
Whoa,

2769
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:49,380
I haven't heard that.
So check this out.

2770
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:53,730
I was talking to this guy,
gerald,

2771
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:57,690
my friend gerald,
who was the guy that wound up testifying

2772
01:57:57,691 --> 01:58:00,960
against him that he tried to pay him to 
murder them.

2773
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:05,130
I was talking to him about it on the 
phone and the phone was being tapped.

2774
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:07,890
So then the cops called me up and they 
say,

2775
01:58:07,891 --> 01:58:09,510
hey,
what do you know about this?

2776
01:58:09,710 --> 01:58:10,740
And I was like,
I'll tell you everything,

2777
01:58:10,741 --> 01:58:15,741
I don't know shit.
But he'd already been arrested and it 

2778
01:58:15,741 --> 01:58:15,741
was already like a thing where they're 
going to trial,

2779
01:58:15,870 --> 01:58:20,870
but I'm like,
all I know is that he was a fake black 

2780
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:23,001
belt who lied about a lot of shit and 
god at the time I didn't even know 

2781
01:58:23,001 --> 01:58:23,430
whether or not he really killed the guy.

2782
01:58:23,710 --> 01:58:25,050
Right.
So full of shit.

2783
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:28,590
If he told You that he killed his wife's
husband,

2784
01:58:28,591 --> 01:58:30,460
you'd be like,
yeah,

2785
01:58:30,570 --> 01:58:33,800
just like you won the karate kuma tay.
Just like you're a brazilian black belt.

2786
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:35,370
It's so hard to tell with a guy like 
that.

2787
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:39,780
But then to do turned out to present,
I was like,

2788
01:58:39,781 --> 01:58:44,781
wow,
I'm pretty much never can somebody who 

2789
01:58:44,781 --> 01:58:44,781
brings a trophy out of the woods.
I mean,

2790
01:58:44,781 --> 01:58:47,680
can you imagine the idea that you're 
going to take this fucking duffle bag,

2791
01:58:47,681 --> 01:58:52,681
put a trophy inside of it and no one's 
gonna notice when you jump back to the 

2792
01:58:52,681 --> 01:58:53,170
duffle bags missed.
That's really funny.

2793
01:58:53,950 --> 01:58:57,710
It was this big map.
It's shaped like a trophy.

2794
01:58:58,070 --> 01:59:00,460
She the fucking fence,
like the rocky statue,

2795
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:03,850
this fucking guy.
Wow.

2796
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:06,130
But there was a lot of that back then.
Man.

2797
01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:09,430
There was a lot of fake martial artists.
It was like super common.

2798
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:14,610
They still to this day,
they'll catch a guy who's a fake black 

2799
01:59:14,610 --> 01:59:14,610
belt.
Yeah.

2800
01:59:14,610 --> 01:59:15,010
White belt,
like put a black belt on and go to a new

2801
01:59:15,011 --> 01:59:16,390
school and.
But he really doesn't know anything.

2802
01:59:16,391 --> 01:59:18,100
I can't go.
But you're going to get exposed.

2803
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:19,510
Why would you do that?
In jujitsu?

2804
01:59:19,511 --> 01:59:20,920
Yes.
But in other martial arts?

2805
01:59:20,921 --> 01:59:22,360
No,
it's because they're mentally ill.

2806
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:23,620
It's alwaYs because they're mentally 
ill.

2807
01:59:24,070 --> 01:59:26,890
And this guy,
rafael torres actually had a fake fight.

2808
01:59:27,070 --> 01:59:32,070
He had a fixed fight.
I'm king of the cage with one of his 

2809
01:59:32,070 --> 01:59:35,011
students.
So he actually had a professional mma 

2810
01:59:35,011 --> 01:59:37,771
fight.
And you know how my friend eddie knew 

2811
01:59:37,771 --> 01:59:37,771
that he was full of shit?
No,

2812
01:59:37,771 --> 01:59:41,190
any new associate because eddie taught 
them this super complicated move called 

2813
01:59:41,190 --> 01:59:45,991
the twister twister is eddie's signature
move and it's basically the guillotine 

2814
01:59:46,550 --> 01:59:49,470
or the guillotine from wrestling with,
uh,

2815
01:59:49,710 --> 01:59:52,200
an added,
a couple of added twist in the way.

2816
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:57,210
Secure as the finish.
Eddie has like a very specific way of 

2817
01:59:57,210 --> 02:00:00,120
escripting the top of the head and also 
locking down the opposite pharcyde leg.

2818
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:05,730
So when he does it,
it's like a terrible position to be and 

2819
02:00:05,730 --> 02:00:08,491
he's crushing your fucking neck,
you're getting all yanked up and it's 

2820
02:00:08,491 --> 02:00:11,491
really rough.
It's really hard to deal with and it's 

2821
02:00:11,491 --> 02:00:12,580
hard to pull off on people super hard to
pull off,

2822
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:16,190
like to just even to set it up and then 
to roll into it you have to be a,

2823
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:20,170
you could get a brazilian jiu jitsu 
black belt who's a high level black belt

2824
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:25,320
and you could teach them how to do it 
and you could probably pull it off on 

2825
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:27,661
someone just because you understand how 
to move his body and the grappling 

2826
02:00:27,661 --> 02:00:27,661
scenario.
But for a guy like him,

2827
02:00:27,661 --> 02:00:28,330
it wasn't really a black male was 
really,

2828
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:29,200
really clunky.

2829
02:00:29,350 --> 02:00:32,490
he went to Thailand and and fought in 
some mma fighters.

2830
02:00:32,491 --> 02:00:33,460
That dude,
hey man,

2831
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:38,640
one in Thailand.
I pulled off the twister and eddie hung 

2832
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:38,640
up the phone.
I was like,

2833
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:39,220
why?
He's like,

2834
02:00:39,970 --> 02:00:41,650
what?
He's like,

2835
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:46,651
dude,
I think something's got to be full of 

2836
02:00:46,651 --> 02:00:49,231
shit.
And he was high as fuck what we're 

2837
02:00:49,231 --> 02:00:49,231
saying having this conversation.
He's like,

2838
02:00:49,231 --> 02:00:49,231
dude,
you can't.

2839
02:00:49,231 --> 02:00:52,330
You can't tell me he did.
I can't believe he did that and so I was

2840
02:00:52,331 --> 02:00:57,331
with eddie in the car when he confronted
him about being a fake black belt.

2841
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:01,330
He confronted the three of you in the 
car?

2842
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:02,710
No,
eddie was on the phone.

2843
02:01:02,711 --> 02:01:07,711
Oh,
I was driving and eddie was right next 

2844
02:01:07,711 --> 02:01:12,061
to me in the passenger seat and he was 
confronting him about it and the guy,

2845
02:01:14,510 --> 02:01:15,340
the guy was like,
no,

2846
02:01:15,341 --> 02:01:16,660
I really am.
I really am.

2847
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:21,580
And Then like cut to six months later 
the dudes in jail for murder.

2848
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:23,800
It's crazy.
So here's him.

2849
02:01:23,890 --> 02:01:25,630
So by the way,
this is a fake name,

2850
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:27,260
right?
Because real.

2851
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:28,170
That's him.
Yep.

2852
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:32,020
That's him.
So the other dude was like his student.

2853
02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:34,120
So this is the fake fight.
Yeah,

2854
02:01:34,121 --> 02:01:35,700
this is a fake fight.
So he,

2855
02:01:35,830 --> 02:01:38,320
he organized this.
I mean this guy had gotten deep into the

2856
02:01:38,321 --> 02:01:39,040
world,
man.

2857
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:42,080
How does it break?
I mean he had a few martial arts skills.

2858
02:01:42,081 --> 02:01:43,940
He wasn't totally unscheduled.
Right,

2859
02:01:43,941 --> 02:01:44,390
right,
right,

2860
02:01:44,391 --> 02:01:45,170
right.
This is it.

2861
02:01:45,230 --> 02:01:46,040
Yeah.
This is it.

2862
02:01:46,041 --> 02:01:50,180
So he's on the bottom here and this 
dude's already tell that he's not,

2863
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:52,040
but they're not really hurting each 
other,

2864
02:01:52,041 --> 02:01:52,720
you know,
they're just like,

2865
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:55,880
he's just pushing them.
It's really funny man.

2866
02:01:56,120 --> 02:02:01,120
Like these guys are acting here.
Like he hits him with a couple of 

2867
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:01,910
punches but not hard,
you know?

2868
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:04,550
I mean this is like some pro Wrestling 
shit.

2869
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:09,910
So he takes him down steps over the leg 
and the guy's punching them.

2870
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:12,110
But I think these are nothing punches 
man.

2871
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:14,140
It's like nothing to this.
And this is,

2872
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:15,320
you know,
for a fact this was.

2873
02:02:15,330 --> 02:02:15,750
Okay,
fine.

2874
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:16,170
Yeah,
yeah,

2875
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:18,830
yeah.
Everybody knows this is like,

2876
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:22,340
they tried to make it what we would call
a hard shoot,

2877
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:27,700
you know,
where you make it look real like pro 

2878
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:27,700
wrestling style.
So then he just drops down,

2879
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:29,420
it gets out leg and he's tapping these 
tap in like right away,

2880
02:02:29,670 --> 02:02:34,670
go,
go back up a little sick and see the 

2881
02:02:34,670 --> 02:02:34,670
setup.
Because it's set up is like what?

2882
02:02:34,670 --> 02:02:35,000
Like here,
he just grabs it.

2883
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:37,460
That is so bad.
It's so bad.

2884
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:41,090
He's so high up on the knee that he 
wouldn't even be putting pressure on the

2885
02:02:41,091 --> 02:02:44,060
knee because he's not controlling the 
lower leg or the upper leg.

2886
02:02:44,061 --> 02:02:45,740
Rather.
He's pulling on the lower leg,

2887
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:48,800
but watch that again,
like when he's pulling on the upper leg,

2888
02:02:48,830 --> 02:02:49,820
look at the gap.

2889
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:55,100
Watch when he goes out.
You could tell he's not a black belt 

2890
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:55,100
doing no.
No.

2891
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:55,100
Super sloppy.
Big,

2892
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:59,780
big,
big giant gap and see where he's 

2893
02:02:59,780 --> 02:02:59,780
yanking.
The dude's already tapping.

2894
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:01,400
He doesn't have control of the upper leg
at all.

2895
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:05,860
He's just pulling on the shin like 
literally his ass is with the knee is in

2896
02:03:05,861 --> 02:03:06,890
his.
He's pulling on the shin,

2897
02:03:06,891 --> 02:03:08,750
which means you wouldn't be putting 
pressure on the knee.

2898
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:11,600
It's such horseshit and it's guys like,
oh my god.

2899
02:03:11,601 --> 02:03:15,260
He wrecked my knee.
It was a total fake fight.

2900
02:03:15,810 --> 02:03:17,690
Yeah,
so that guy went on to be a murderer.

2901
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:20,780
I think he might be up for parole soon 
or something.

2902
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:24,470
Do it.
People are horribly murdered.

2903
02:03:24,471 --> 02:03:26,240
Somebody too.
That's the crazy thing.

2904
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:31,300
People get out of jail for murder to go 
to jail for murder and you're in the 

2905
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:31,900
back by the way.
No,

2906
02:03:31,950 --> 02:03:32,600
that's a new one.

2907
02:03:32,630 --> 02:03:34,490
That's what males got to.
It's got to now,

2908
02:03:34,491 --> 02:03:36,230
bro.
That one he did on tv.

2909
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:37,070
Oh,
crazy man.

2910
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:38,150
Yeah,
that's crazy.

2911
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:43,630
I mean,
people have pulled off some sloppy ass 

2912
02:03:43,630 --> 02:03:43,630
knee bars.
Don't get me wrong,

2913
02:03:43,630 --> 02:03:43,630
but I know for a fact.
That's fact.

2914
02:03:43,630 --> 02:03:44,790
Yeah,
yeah,

2915
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:46,520
yeah.
Dude.

2916
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:52,240
Not people do,
but that's the real nutty things like 

2917
02:03:52,240 --> 02:03:55,550
people trying to concoct an artificial 
identity.

2918
02:03:55,850 --> 02:04:00,350
Like my dad's brazilian,
my name is damien monroe.

2919
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:05,410
People are just as people are just so 
afraid of being nothing.

2920
02:04:08,241 --> 02:04:13,241
You know what I mean?
Is that it or does he identify with a 

2921
02:04:13,241 --> 02:04:13,540
half Brazilian,
brazilian jiu jitsu black belt?

2922
02:04:14,570 --> 02:04:19,400
Maybe we let them just with.
How much different is that than identify

2923
02:04:19,401 --> 02:04:24,401
with being a six year old girl?
It's only Different when you get your 

2924
02:04:24,401 --> 02:04:24,401
ass kicked.
Well,

2925
02:04:24,401 --> 02:04:29,200
if you're a six year old girl and you go
to school with my kid and it turns out 

2926
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:29,200
you're 50,
I might beat your ass.

2927
02:04:29,610 --> 02:04:32,300
I'm going to be a black belt.
I might not trust you.

2928
02:04:33,370 --> 02:04:38,370
Maybe I might start asking you some 
questions like he has adopted mommy and 

2929
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:38,370
do you see that?
Yes,

2930
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:38,820
I saw that.
Yeah.

2931
02:04:38,821 --> 02:04:40,320
I'm just trying to think.
We're getting trolled.

2932
02:04:40,590 --> 02:04:42,060
Maybe trying to think.
That's not even real.

2933
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:43,950
It's just everything's a south park 
episode now.

2934
02:04:44,700 --> 02:04:47,010
That's what it feels like.
It feels like it's right in itself.

2935
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,150
It does.
It does.

2936
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:52,190
Who'd you vote?
Do you vote?

2937
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:56,310
No,
I honestly couldn't do it.

2938
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:57,120
Couldn't do it.
Yeah.

2939
02:04:57,250 --> 02:04:58,220
Yeah.
I'm hoping to.

2940
02:04:58,230 --> 02:05:00,030
Al franken runs saying they're here 
right now.

2941
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:05,090
Really you think?
I think al franken can be the best 

2942
02:05:05,090 --> 02:05:05,090
president we've ever had.
I really do.

2943
02:05:05,090 --> 02:05:07,260
I think he's gotten tremendous ethics 
and he's a comedian.

2944
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:10,530
That will be amazing if is a true 
patriot.

2945
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:12,270
really is that guy.
Can.

2946
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:17,320
You know al frankin can draw the United 
States and draw all the boundarIes for 

2947
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:18,030
all the states by by memory.

2948
02:05:19,230 --> 02:05:21,900
He actually can draw the outlines of 
each state.

2949
02:05:22,350 --> 02:05:24,720
All 50 of them.
I've never seen him do that.

2950
02:05:24,721 --> 02:05:26,070
No,
that's crazy.

2951
02:05:26,071 --> 02:05:27,420
Pull it up.
There's a video of it.

2952
02:05:27,421 --> 02:05:32,421
It's fucking amazing.
He walks up to a whiteboard and just 

2953
02:05:32,421 --> 02:05:33,030
draws the United States and the right 
shape,

2954
02:05:33,031 --> 02:05:36,180
like he could be a match.
If he was living in the 15 hundreds,

2955
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:37,800
you will be.
He'd be the guy,

2956
02:05:38,130 --> 02:05:40,050
he'd be the most famous guy in the world
to be the map maker.

2957
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:42,780
I would maybe be able to do califorNia 
and that's it.

2958
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:46,360
I think I could get the line right.
Yeah.

2959
02:05:46,650 --> 02:05:48,780
Oh yeah.
The inside line.

2960
02:05:48,810 --> 02:05:50,070
Watch them do this.
This is beautiful.

2961
02:05:50,071 --> 02:05:51,180
Go full screen.
It's crazy.

2962
02:05:52,470 --> 02:05:54,030
Well,
that's already crazy,

2963
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:54,810
dude.
He's amazing.

2964
02:05:54,811 --> 02:05:59,811
He draws the great lakes in the right 
size and shape and he does this all By 

2965
02:05:59,811 --> 02:06:03,150
hand seat because a lot of people think 
of al franken as you know,

2966
02:06:03,151 --> 02:06:06,180
he was a comedian and he's on saturday 
night live people.

2967
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:08,720
Uh,
I don't think they truly appreciate his,

2968
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:11,160
his intellect.
He's a brilliaNt guy,

2969
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:16,400
but he's also to self deprecating and 
too wise,

2970
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:21,180
too humble to want to be the president.
He just doesN't have that desire in him.

2971
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:24,840
That's such a shame because to be a 
president,

2972
02:06:24,841 --> 02:06:28,500
like you almost have to be the type of 
person who would never.

2973
02:06:28,830 --> 02:06:31,200
Who should never be president in order 
to run?

2974
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:33,140
Yeah,
yeah,

2975
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:38,180
I hear that.
But like if he wanted to be the 

2976
02:06:38,180 --> 02:06:41,721
president,
I think he could be like our best 

2977
02:06:41,721 --> 02:06:42,630
president ever.
Who the fuck else could do this?

2978
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:45,870
You want to talk about patriotism?
It's fucking guy.

2979
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:48,120
Really.
that would be a good thing to run on.

2980
02:06:48,121 --> 02:06:50,190
It'd be like,
I could draw the pitch.

2981
02:06:50,250 --> 02:06:53,290
Hey Donald Trump draw.
But that's crazy though.

2982
02:06:53,291 --> 02:06:58,291
What?
He must have practiced this or he's got 

2983
02:06:58,291 --> 02:06:58,291
to have a crazy mind.
That's just like.

2984
02:06:58,291 --> 02:06:58,291
That's what I'm saying,
man.

2985
02:06:58,291 --> 02:06:59,880
He just drew Alaska son.
Now he comes Hawaii.

2986
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:02,850
Get the fuck outta here.
Are you crazy?

2987
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:05,730
back that up to the 2009,
Minnesota state fair.

2988
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:06,900
First of all,
he loses points.

2989
02:07:06,901 --> 02:07:09,440
We're going to the Minnesota state fair.

2990
02:07:11,970 --> 02:07:13,780
That's amazing.
Yeah,

2991
02:07:14,610 --> 02:07:19,610
but also my views is that if I was to 
have a billion but it probably has a 

2992
02:07:20,050 --> 02:07:20,940
million,
2 million,

2993
02:07:20,941 --> 02:07:23,140
$300,000,
that's more than one video.

2994
02:07:23,210 --> 02:07:24,560
I'm doing this to.
He it,

2995
02:07:24,790 --> 02:07:25,790
it doesn't like a lot.
Oh,

2996
02:07:25,791 --> 02:07:30,791
so it's a lot of tricks.
Cool parlor trick and he gets pushed 

2997
02:07:30,791 --> 02:07:32,760
here for that.
Probably drives it all up,

2998
02:07:32,761 --> 02:07:34,690
but then this one is on me to draw 
America.

2999
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:36,150
I have to go,
oh,

3000
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:37,990
he's doing this one on a piece of 
cardboard.

3001
02:07:38,010 --> 02:07:39,250
Oh,
you could do it on any surface.

3002
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:40,600
Crazy,
bro.

3003
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:42,640
I wonder if he does it on the sidewalk 
with chalk.

3004
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:45,850
Can you do it in the sand?
And that would be.

3005
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:49,300
Yeah,
it's a,

3006
02:07:49,330 --> 02:07:52,030
it's amazing.
We definitely need a better president.

3007
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:54,760
You know,
we definitely need something new.

3008
02:07:55,350 --> 02:07:55,920
This,
uh,

3009
02:07:56,330 --> 02:07:58,260
this system we've got going on right 
now,

3010
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,570
just everybody hates each other.
So that's a bad thing.

3011
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:05,600
It's terrible.
Everybody on the left and everybody in 

3012
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:05,600
the right,
everybody's at each other's throats.

3013
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:07,320
I used to think it was the right that 
was the dangerous,

3014
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:12,340
but now the left is so they're so mad 
and shit and they're responding to the 

3015
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:13,180
right.
It goes this way.

3016
02:08:13,181 --> 02:08:14,650
And then it goes that way.
You know,

3017
02:08:14,651 --> 02:08:17,710
people get super fucking angry when 
obama's,

3018
02:08:17,711 --> 02:08:22,711
the president as the right you have to 
worry about and then try it comes the 

3019
02:08:22,711 --> 02:08:25,591
president.
Everybody gets super aggressive on the 

3020
02:08:25,591 --> 02:08:25,591
left.
What's interesting is they said that gun

3021
02:08:25,591 --> 02:08:27,520
sales go up when a democratic president,
because they get scared.

3022
02:08:27,970 --> 02:08:29,470
People get scared.
They're going to take your guns.

3023
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:31,900
What's crazy,
as trump was a lifelong democrat,

3024
02:08:32,260 --> 02:08:37,260
I know life long democrat,
but if anybody's ever had like the back 

3025
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:38,000
of gun owners,
oh,

3026
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:41,950
trump above all a lot because his sons 
sons are hunters,

3027
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:45,970
especially donald jr.
Big time sportsmen.

3028
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:50,110
Conservationists very much into animals 
hunts a lot.

3029
02:08:50,590 --> 02:08:52,150
Like legitimately he's,
he's,

3030
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:54,760
you know,
like a respected hunter.

3031
02:08:55,930 --> 02:08:58,060
But uh,
the um,

3032
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:01,930
the doesn't shock me that people buy 
more guns,

3033
02:09:02,850 --> 02:09:04,240
but I guess I didn't think of it like 
that.

3034
02:09:04,241 --> 02:09:05,020
And then once I heard,
I was like,

3035
02:09:05,021 --> 02:09:05,680
yeah,
that makes sense.

3036
02:09:05,770 --> 02:09:10,770
If that's the big fear that people have 
is that one day the government's going 

3037
02:09:10,770 --> 02:09:14,571
to step in and they're going to take 
your guns away and they're going to 

3038
02:09:14,571 --> 02:09:14,980
control you with an iron fist and tell 
you what to do.

3039
02:09:15,310 --> 02:09:16,330
And people say,
no way.

3040
02:09:16,331 --> 02:09:21,331
That's never gonna happen.
But I'm not advocating everybody go out 

3041
02:09:21,821 --> 02:09:22,470
and get a gun.

3042
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:24,550
But if you say,
that could never happen,

3043
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:27,280
what's happening right now with people?
If you go to North Korea,

3044
02:09:27,281 --> 02:09:28,330
it's happened.
Right.

3045
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:29,170
Okay.
How's it?

3046
02:09:29,230 --> 02:09:30,430
How's that going on?
Right now?

3047
02:09:30,431 --> 02:09:32,110
In 2017.
First of all,

3048
02:09:32,111 --> 02:09:34,150
you don't have an armed population.
You don't.

3049
02:09:34,151 --> 02:09:36,040
You know,
you don't have a free press.

3050
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:38,140
There's a lot of factors,
right?

3051
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:43,260
Yeah.
But the government could take it over 

3052
02:09:43,260 --> 02:09:45,901
anyway.
The problem with saying that is we are 

3053
02:09:45,901 --> 02:09:48,751
the government,
so if you say the government can take 

3054
02:09:48,751 --> 02:09:48,751
over the United States of America with 
soldiers,

3055
02:09:48,751 --> 02:09:51,310
those soldiers are citizens.
They might be soldiers,

3056
02:09:51,311 --> 02:09:52,810
but there are people that like you and 
I,

3057
02:09:52,900 --> 02:09:53,970
they're not global.
Gotcha.

3058
02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:55,850
Yeah.
Not one percenters who own a,

3059
02:09:56,140 --> 02:09:58,080
like it's going to be very fucking hard.
Right.

3060
02:09:58,120 --> 02:10:02,560
Some young guy from Kentucky to pull a 
gun on his neighbors because in America,

3061
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:07,620
dickhead in a suit that,
you know as a senator or whatever the 

3062
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:07,620
fuck it is,
tells them what to do.

3063
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:10,360
There's just a fine line of control that
you have some really good.

3064
02:10:10,361 --> 02:10:12,010
When you say the military will take over
the country,

3065
02:10:12,011 --> 02:10:14,410
the military is us.
They're just regular people.

3066
02:10:14,470 --> 02:10:15,040
Right?
Right.

3067
02:10:15,390 --> 02:10:20,390
It's when they get to the highest levels
of government that gets weird when 

3068
02:10:20,390 --> 02:10:22,150
they're completely set,
when they were in a war room and they've

3069
02:10:22,151 --> 02:10:26,200
never actually been in a war and making 
politically based decisions,

3070
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:31,680
that's when shit gets squirrely.
It's the network as the executive 

3071
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:33,200
network executives because getting a guy
to do that though,

3072
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:35,090
like getting.
Especially in America,

3073
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:37,110
I mean this is not North Korea,
man.

3074
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:41,330
We we have a way different attitude 
about each other and about human beings.

3075
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:46,720
It would be incredibly difficult to get 
some regular kid from northern 

3076
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:51,191
California to join the military.
I just shut down schools and take away 

3077
02:10:51,681 --> 02:10:53,330
people's guns in a door to door raid.

3078
02:10:53,390 --> 02:10:57,350
I guess I just always feel that people 
are such followers that it would happen,

3079
02:10:57,351 --> 02:10:58,690
but yeah,
you're probably fuck it.

3080
02:10:58,700 --> 02:11:03,700
Hope you're right.
People are followers until some shit 

3081
02:11:03,700 --> 02:11:06,371
goes down and if some shit goes down,
people will rise to the occasion like 

3082
02:11:06,371 --> 02:11:07,660
that.
That is what happened after september 11

3083
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:12,680
when they woke up a sleeping lion and 
people were excited about going to war 

3084
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:16,151
again.
It gets real dangerous when something 

3085
02:11:16,151 --> 02:11:17,930
happens because people love like there's
a great book that I just read from,

3086
02:11:17,931 --> 02:11:22,931
I'm sebastian younger,
it's called tribe and it's all about 

3087
02:11:22,931 --> 02:11:26,860
bonding during war time and now people 
are losing their connection to each 

3088
02:11:27,111 --> 02:11:32,111
other by not encountering difficulty and
not struggling and that he lives in a 

3089
02:11:33,501 --> 02:11:38,501
poor neighborhood.
This guy's like a super world famous 

3090
02:11:38,501 --> 02:11:40,841
writer and he lives in a poor 
neighborhood and the lower east side 

3091
02:11:40,841 --> 02:11:41,510
because he likes being around like 
regular people.

3092
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:44,210
I mean,
his books are very successful.

3093
02:11:44,211 --> 02:11:49,211
I got to imagine he makes a good living 
and he's a very famous war journalists 

3094
02:11:49,211 --> 02:11:51,470
and correspondent and just,
uh,

3095
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:52,760
he's,
he's got.

3096
02:11:53,260 --> 02:11:58,260
It's his idea is that the,
the people that live soft lives and the 

3097
02:11:58,260 --> 02:12:00,080
people that like,
your body's on designed for it.

3098
02:12:00,081 --> 02:12:05,081
It's not good.
It's not healthy and that's why people 

3099
02:12:05,081 --> 02:12:06,971
feel like shit and that the happier 
people are the people that are under 

3100
02:12:06,971 --> 02:12:08,540
stress and that if something did happen 
to us,

3101
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:11,360
we would probably feel better.
And really they say,

3102
02:12:11,361 --> 02:12:16,361
yeah,
they say that their guy more likely to 

3103
02:12:16,361 --> 02:12:16,361
kill himself as the businessman who was 
on the top floor,

3104
02:12:16,361 --> 02:12:20,510
that fucking lost it all.
Then the guy who just kinda has had a 

3105
02:12:20,510 --> 02:12:22,130
rough life because it did not deal with 
it.

3106
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:25,460
There was this bernie made off episode 
of radiolab,

3107
02:12:25,610 --> 02:12:30,590
radiolab where he's talking to this guy 
and this guy made like a.

3108
02:12:30,590 --> 02:12:33,920
I think he made like $9,000,000,000
with bernie.

3109
02:12:34,130 --> 02:12:36,020
And he had a gift.
He had a giveaway,

3110
02:12:36,170 --> 02:12:39,020
gives 7 billion of it back and burning 
was trying to get him.

3111
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:40,990
Not bernie sanders.
Bernie madoff.

3112
02:12:41,010 --> 02:12:42,210
Bernie madoff.
Say bernie sanders.

3113
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:44,420
I was thinking bernie sanders for some 
reason.

3114
02:12:44,421 --> 02:12:46,190
I think he fucked his name up.
Anyway,

3115
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:49,250
I'm bernie madoff was telling this guy 
that he had to give the money back.

3116
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:52,010
You know what you did right now.
We were in this were caught.

3117
02:12:52,011 --> 02:12:54,410
We've got to give this money back.
And the guy killed himself.

3118
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:58,040
So he's got 2 billion.
He's like not enough.

3119
02:12:58,850 --> 02:13:00,710
What they found on the bottom of the 
pool,

3120
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:05,950
$2,000,000,000,
not enough wonder if it was the shame 

3121
02:13:05,950 --> 02:13:07,510
that made him kill himself.
A clang.

3122
02:13:07,550 --> 02:13:08,450
Clang.
Clang.

3123
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:11,360
Shay,
that'll make you kill yourself,

3124
02:13:11,361 --> 02:13:11,960
man.
Well,

3125
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:16,250
I think if you have $9,000,000,000
and you're a guy that is just constantly

3126
02:13:16,251 --> 02:13:21,251
obsessed with money,
you're probably bawling,

3127
02:13:22,340 --> 02:13:27,340
bawling,
out of control and maxed out across the 

3128
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:27,340
board.

3129
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:27,650
You probably got multiple ferrari's on 
their way to you right now.

3130
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:30,110
I need a bigger jet,
you know?

3131
02:13:30,111 --> 02:13:31,680
Oh,
how much the island.

3132
02:13:31,710 --> 02:13:33,170
I'll take it,
right?

3133
02:13:33,210 --> 02:13:36,180
You have 9 billion and then you're like,
you say,

3134
02:13:36,181 --> 02:13:41,181
okay,
I got an I need to make 300 million a 

3135
02:13:41,181 --> 02:13:41,181
year just to pay my bill.
Right?

3136
02:13:41,181 --> 02:13:44,310
Imagine let me scale back,
and then all of a sudden someone says,

3137
02:13:44,311 --> 02:13:46,020
hey man,
you got to give seven of it back.

3138
02:13:46,050 --> 02:13:46,860
Like,
I don't have it.

3139
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:50,850
I don't have to be how it was.
Well,

3140
02:13:50,910 --> 02:13:55,020
I think the shame too,
dot maybe Just died of a heart attack.

3141
02:13:55,380 --> 02:13:56,830
Maybe I didn't fell in the pool.
yeah,

3142
02:13:58,410 --> 02:14:01,410
that's a tough way to kill yourself.
Jump in and start breathing through.

3143
02:14:01,411 --> 02:14:03,930
They need to make this a fucking 
forensic files episode,

3144
02:14:03,990 --> 02:14:04,500
man.
We'll find it.

3145
02:14:04,501 --> 02:14:06,540
We'll get it.
Probably exists on the hallmark channel.

3146
02:14:06,541 --> 02:14:06,990
Probably does.

3147
02:14:08,130 --> 02:14:12,720
Yeah,
so he's like a some study ex spouse,

3148
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:14,250
right?
Sometimes a woman.

3149
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:16,200
Yeah.
Well they have that show for that.

3150
02:14:16,201 --> 02:14:18,210
They have like sinful woman or whatever 
the hell it's called.

3151
02:14:19,230 --> 02:14:21,330
They call it a scorned.
Good.

3152
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:22,890
Get wives are.
You know what I mean?

3153
02:14:22,891 --> 02:14:24,540
It's always.
Yeah.

3154
02:14:24,690 --> 02:14:25,980
When,
when is it going to happen?

3155
02:14:25,981 --> 02:14:28,200
I'm one of those reality shows like 
those real housewives.

3156
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:33,500
When is one of those bitches?
Someone ax murder one of those other 

3157
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:33,500
chicks.
I mean it will happen.

3158
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:35,880
How has it not already?
They fight.

3159
02:14:35,940 --> 02:14:37,200
They claw each other.
Right.

3160
02:14:37,470 --> 02:14:40,320
I fucking hate that.
That's a show.

3161
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:42,900
Even Just so they're so popular.
I know.

3162
02:14:42,901 --> 02:14:45,110
It's crazy.
A friend of mine went to a,

3163
02:14:45,490 --> 02:14:50,490
just one of the real housewives ladies 
has a restaurant in beverly hills in 

3164
02:14:50,490 --> 02:14:52,590
front of mine.
Went to the restaurant and she said that

3165
02:14:52,591 --> 02:14:55,950
when the ladY walked in that everybody 
treated her like royalty.

3166
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:57,270
WHen she's here,
she's here,

3167
02:14:57,271 --> 02:15:02,271
she's here so crazy just walking in with
their dog and you're famous for being a 

3168
02:15:02,271 --> 02:15:04,650
piece of shit.
I mean you,

3169
02:15:04,660 --> 02:15:05,700
you,
you are though.

3170
02:15:05,730 --> 02:15:08,250
like they,
they glorify at least in my show.

3171
02:15:08,251 --> 02:15:10,230
I'm not saying the person actually,
but like yeah,

3172
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:13,290
those people are a piece of shit.
Yeah.

3173
02:15:13,291 --> 02:15:16,140
You piece of shit and they're like,
oh that's.

3174
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:18,570
But she wasn't on the show.
That's one of the things.

3175
02:15:18,571 --> 02:15:20,370
She was like one of the more good one 
side.

3176
02:15:20,730 --> 02:15:21,150
Sure.
Yeah.

3177
02:15:21,151 --> 02:15:26,151
I mean I don't know much.
I don't know enough about the shit I'm 

3178
02:15:26,151 --> 02:15:26,151
being.
It's just bizarre that you would have so

3179
02:15:26,151 --> 02:15:29,520
much money and still want to expose 
yourself to that because like the amount

3180
02:15:29,521 --> 02:15:34,521
of nuttiness and hate,
but maybe It's just more exciting than 

3181
02:15:34,521 --> 02:15:35,910
whatever else they're doing and maybe 
when you're on xanax it's not so bad.

3182
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:40,980
Maybe just pop a few xanax every day.
Cameras are going off.

3183
02:15:41,980 --> 02:15:43,820
You don't even seizure.
Yeah.

3184
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:46,510
Anybody ever sees you from the 
paparazzi?

3185
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:50,820
Find google pop razzi causes someone to 
seizure.

3186
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:55,350
Guaranteed.
It's happened a lot of flashes.

3187
02:15:55,351 --> 02:16:00,351
If for some maybe wacky dude was screw 
loose and then started spasming to 

3188
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:05,880
famous,
we would've heard about it.

3189
02:16:06,430 --> 02:16:08,160
Right.
But if it was a famous person,

3190
02:16:08,161 --> 02:16:13,161
who would you imagine like johnny depp?
Like he does coke everyday for a month 

3191
02:16:13,161 --> 02:16:17,720
and then,
or like the cameras go off and it's just

3192
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:23,010
whatever the fucking fine wire in that 
field is in his brain,

3193
02:16:23,011 --> 02:16:24,390
blows out like an old light bulb.

3194
02:16:31,590 --> 02:16:36,590
You find something.
And the only person I could find is a 

3195
02:16:36,590 --> 02:16:36,590
david beckham's son.
Oh,

3196
02:16:36,590 --> 02:16:39,400
the 10 year old kid.
And he started freaking out.

3197
02:16:39,800 --> 02:16:41,680
So we just freaked out.
But he didn't have a seizure.

3198
02:16:41,681 --> 02:16:42,150
Did he?
Well,

3199
02:16:42,310 --> 02:16:43,780
I don't know if it led to nashville 
seizure.

3200
02:16:43,781 --> 02:16:44,910
It says,
uh,

3201
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:46,570
he says he's got epilepsy.
Leave him alone.

3202
02:16:46,650 --> 02:16:47,890
Oh,
he does have epilepsy?

3203
02:16:47,891 --> 02:16:49,940
Yeah.
Might be what?

3204
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:54,490
Find out google that why two flashing 
lights cause people to have seizures.

3205
02:16:55,070 --> 02:16:56,230
Hmm.
What do you think?

3206
02:16:56,231 --> 02:16:57,410
Crystal?
You know,

3207
02:16:57,430 --> 02:17:00,130
but I think that I would never think 
about that in my life.

3208
02:17:00,250 --> 02:17:03,160
You wouldn't think about that because it
would never affect me.

3209
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:08,220
So I'd be interested in how the human 
mind works and the flaws of the 

3210
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:08,220
operating system.
I am a little bit.

3211
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:09,100
Not that much though.
Huh?

3212
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:11,440
Well I want you to tell me,
but I don't want to have to look it up.

3213
02:17:12,250 --> 02:17:17,250
It says it's from epilepsy.com
for about three percent of people with 

3214
02:17:17,471 --> 02:17:22,471
epilepsy.
Exposure of flashing lights as certain 

3215
02:17:22,471 --> 02:17:22,471
intensities.
Slow.

3216
02:17:22,471 --> 02:17:22,471
Yeah.
So it's not even.

3217
02:17:22,550 --> 02:17:27,550
I didn't know that.
Well that makes sense because I would 

3218
02:17:27,550 --> 02:17:27,550
have heard of it.
Right.

3219
02:17:27,550 --> 02:17:28,960
You think you would have heard of it,
but for my friend it was his wife.

3220
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:30,670
He's got the thing to you remember?
Shit.

3221
02:17:30,671 --> 02:17:32,650
I don't remember shit.
So I'm just gonna forget this anyway.

3222
02:17:32,651 --> 02:17:33,730
Which sucks.
You don't remember.

3223
02:17:33,790 --> 02:17:35,150
Definitely shopping mall from when I 
was.

3224
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:37,120
That's what I'm saying.
I can't believe you remember that.

3225
02:17:37,330 --> 02:17:41,170
That's ridiculous.
That's really impressive.

3226
02:17:41,380 --> 02:17:44,230
If you're out there boys.
Thanks for having me in your basement.

3227
02:17:45,630 --> 02:17:48,700
It was cool to think that maybe their 
fucking incubus now you have no idea.

3228
02:17:48,701 --> 02:17:49,870
You know what mean?
I don't think so.

3229
02:17:50,590 --> 02:17:51,820
Yeah.
They're probably not around anymore.

3230
02:17:52,810 --> 02:17:54,020
Du du du du,
du,

3231
02:17:54,030 --> 02:17:57,570
du du du du.

3232
02:17:58,090 --> 02:17:59,090
I think chris,
leah,

3233
02:17:59,110 --> 02:18:04,110
check down traffic.
He's like,

3234
02:18:04,300 --> 02:18:08,650
it's fucking 4:00.
Broken lives in the fucking suburbs.

3235
02:18:09,150 --> 02:18:11,370
It wasn't as hard as I thought.
Did it?

3236
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:17,520
Yeah.
You gotta stick to the roads still the 

3237
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:17,520
muellers ways.
That's the way it's the best.

3238
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:22,440
Oh,
that's the boob you drive to some weird 

3239
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:22,440
neighborhood.
It's people are so pissed.

3240
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:22,570
People that never had any new 
neighborhood.

3241
02:18:23,150 --> 02:18:25,600
It's be.
How does it not catch on more dude?

3242
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:28,210
Because people don't talk about it that 
much.

3243
02:18:28,211 --> 02:18:32,500
And chris lee a check though.
I check out too bad.

3244
02:18:32,501 --> 02:18:34,320
Sometimes.
Podcasts or where you got to?

3245
02:18:34,321 --> 02:18:37,360
It's a sustained.
I can do like an hour and a half.

3246
02:18:37,420 --> 02:18:39,460
We're like two and a half hours in now.
Wow.

3247
02:18:39,461 --> 02:18:39,870
Really?
Well,

3248
02:18:39,871 --> 02:18:42,040
that was quick though too.
We're friends.

3249
02:18:42,530 --> 02:18:44,950
Chad was the last time we did two years 
ago.

3250
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:49,030
The first one we may be even more.
We've become good friends.

3251
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:51,580
We see each other all the time.
Yeah,

3252
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:54,070
we're colleagues.
We're out there in the battlefield,

3253
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:59,250
the pedal field of jokes.
It's so cool to do the fucking comedy 

3254
02:18:59,250 --> 02:18:59,560
store man and like to be.
I just,

3255
02:18:59,600 --> 02:19:04,600
I trY to think about like,
I'm so fortunate to be a part of that 

3256
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:08,310
like ever since you came back and like,
you know,

3257
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:13,980
it's just so and it was always cool,
but like I loved the club always and I 

3258
02:19:13,980 --> 02:19:14,790
think you did too,
you know,

3259
02:19:14,910 --> 02:19:19,910
always.
But then like you came back and then 

3260
02:19:19,910 --> 02:19:20,220
like other guys kept,
other guys came up and they,

3261
02:19:20,221 --> 02:19:21,130
they,
you know,

3262
02:19:21,220 --> 02:19:23,320
they let.
It's also eric and adam too.

3263
02:19:23,650 --> 02:19:24,150
Yeah,
they're.

3264
02:19:24,250 --> 02:19:24,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

3265
02:19:24,881 --> 02:19:29,881
Eric and adam,
they've changed the atmosphere of the 

3266
02:19:29,881 --> 02:19:32,020
place.
It's now super comedian friendly and 

3267
02:19:32,020 --> 02:19:32,020
supportive.
It's just,

3268
02:19:32,020 --> 02:19:34,310
it's different place.
Crazy how great it is now.

3269
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:36,140
Yeah,
and everybody enjoys it too.

3270
02:19:36,140 --> 02:19:37,970
Like everybody,
like we look at each other,

3271
02:19:37,971 --> 02:19:38,670
we're like,
whoa,

3272
02:19:39,370 --> 02:19:40,710
know,
you know,

3273
02:19:40,990 --> 02:19:45,990
it could have been born in Afghanistan,
could have been living in the middle of 

3274
02:19:45,990 --> 02:19:47,840
the mountains somewhere in Nepal.
We without sucking go tits,

3275
02:19:48,020 --> 02:19:49,760
trying to get some moisture.
We could've been all.

3276
02:19:49,761 --> 02:19:52,190
We all could have been trying to win 
trophies in the forest.

3277
02:19:52,191 --> 02:19:55,010
Men win Trophies in the roads,
in the forest,

3278
02:19:55,011 --> 02:19:58,010
the coma,
no rules come back.

3279
02:19:58,370 --> 02:20:00,080
Hands are perfect.
No cuts,

3280
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:05,500
empty duffel bag maybe rubs on his face.
I want dude killed them all on the first

3281
02:20:05,901 --> 02:20:06,800
round.
Everybody did.

3282
02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:12,800
Something gets seven year old would come
up with,

3283
02:20:13,550 --> 02:20:14,570
hey,
this is what I'll do.

3284
02:20:14,690 --> 02:20:19,690
I'm going to get a trophy.
I want to write deadliest man the world 

3285
02:20:19,690 --> 02:20:19,760
and I'm going to put that trophy and a 
duffel bag.

3286
02:20:19,790 --> 02:20:24,790
Then I'm going to go gently expand in 
the world around the world.

3287
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:28,550
I never forget when I was first starting
to take martial arts.

3288
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:32,160
There's this kid who came to my high 
school and he's with this girl and uh,

3289
02:20:32,300 --> 02:20:35,540
the girl was like really pretty and she 
didn't talk much.

3290
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:40,560
Yeah,
she was like in my class and he wasn't 

3291
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:40,560
like,
he was from like another school and uh,

3292
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:42,500
he had a Jean jacket on.
He looked like fucking billy jack.

3293
02:20:42,501 --> 02:20:45,450
This guy was like real skinny and like,
why are we looking at.

3294
02:20:45,710 --> 02:20:50,710
And someone sAid he did karate.
I did karate and he was smoking a 

3295
02:20:50,710 --> 02:20:51,270
cigarette and I remember he had a.

3296
02:20:51,770 --> 02:20:56,770
He had someone hold their hand up so he 
could demonstrate as moves in front of 

3297
02:20:56,770 --> 02:21:00,911
everybody.
Everybody scared and he did it inside 

3298
02:21:00,911 --> 02:21:02,700
crescent kick swag swag.
That guy's hand and there,

3299
02:21:02,701 --> 02:21:03,590
but it's like,
ooh,

3300
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:06,050
that's the real shit.
That's the real shit.

3301
02:21:06,480 --> 02:21:11,480
I'll never forget that.
I remember thinking that guy was 

3302
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:11,480
watching them going,
I think that guy's full of shit,

3303
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:14,790
but I didn't know anything back then.
It was now here.

3304
02:21:14,970 --> 02:21:15,860
Oh,
100 percent.

3305
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:17,540
Oh he was.
Now it'd be laughing,

3306
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,460
but I looked in it back then.
I was like,

3307
02:21:19,990 --> 02:21:24,990
something wrong.
I think that guy just knows how throw 

3308
02:21:24,990 --> 02:21:24,990
his leg in the.
I don't know if it's a real kick.

3309
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:27,530
It was something that bad.
I was like,

3310
02:21:27,531 --> 02:21:30,230
that is not a real kick.
You could just lie man,

3311
02:21:30,470 --> 02:21:31,790
and just.
I'm a fucking,

3312
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:32,660
you know,
pilot.

3313
02:21:33,230 --> 02:21:34,400
The way he drew it,
it was like,

3314
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:39,420
it was so stupid.
His leg fucking went up in the air.

3315
02:21:41,510 --> 02:21:44,390
It just was so ineffective in a real 
life scenario.

3316
02:21:45,050 --> 02:21:47,570
Not that the crescent kick doesn't work,
it's just the way he did it.

3317
02:21:48,410 --> 02:21:51,230
Something my brain read,
but I didn't know anything back then.

3318
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:53,690
You can remember I told you about that 
book.

3319
02:21:53,691 --> 02:21:55,490
Gift of fear.
Yeah.

3320
02:21:55,540 --> 02:22:00,540
Yeah.
About how you can send shit like that 

3321
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:00,540
and then you know,
you know what,

3322
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:00,540
even though you don't know.
You know what?

3323
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:04,850
That's blink malcolm gladwell's blink,
blink st,

3324
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:08,110
but blink malcolm gladwell's book thing 
about that.

3325
02:22:08,130 --> 02:22:08,780
Got it.
yeah.

3326
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:10,070
Just read it.
It's um,

3327
02:22:10,310 --> 02:22:15,310
it's all essentially about how there's 
certain things where you know 

3328
02:22:15,310 --> 02:22:15,310
immediately.
Yeah,

3329
02:22:15,310 --> 02:22:20,050
yeah.
I just finished the audio but we're 

3330
02:22:20,050 --> 02:22:20,050
conditioned to cover it up and be like,
no,

3331
02:22:20,050 --> 02:22:20,210
that's not right.
But it's like,

3332
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:22,010
that's why you talked to all these women
and they were like,

3333
02:22:22,011 --> 02:22:24,260
I knew something was wrong before,
you know what I mean?

3334
02:22:24,261 --> 02:22:24,780
Yeah,
yeah.

3335
02:22:24,860 --> 02:22:26,130
A lot of times you know something.

3336
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:31,400
And there's one great story in the book 
where they were talking about this 

3337
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:34,641
statue that was this incredible ancient 
roman stat from roland or ancient greek.

3338
02:22:35,220 --> 02:22:37,020
I forget which one,
but um,

3339
02:22:37,050 --> 02:22:40,470
it was a forgery and,
but it was perfect,

3340
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:42,240
like the way it looked,
it was amazing,

3341
02:22:42,241 --> 02:22:47,241
but they brought in front of these art 
collectors and they looked at it for a 

3342
02:22:47,241 --> 02:22:47,241
second and went,
this is not,

3343
02:22:47,241 --> 02:22:48,450
this is not good,
is not good.

3344
02:22:48,451 --> 02:22:50,640
ThIs is fake.
Like the immediately there was something

3345
02:22:50,641 --> 02:22:55,641
about it,
like they had done testing on the 

3346
02:22:55,641 --> 02:22:55,641
surface of it and know what,
what it was.

3347
02:22:55,641 --> 02:22:55,950
They knew,
they felt it.

3348
02:22:56,340 --> 02:23:01,340
They knew that the stone came from a 
certain part of the world is ancient 

3349
02:23:01,340 --> 02:23:04,710
part of the world that was ancient stone
by the amount of some sort of a mineral.

3350
02:23:04,770 --> 02:23:09,770
While on the outside of it they realized
that it had been sitting in the ground 

3351
02:23:09,770 --> 02:23:10,320
for thousands of years.

3352
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:12,330
They thought turned out bullshit.
They just do.

3353
02:23:12,480 --> 02:23:15,480
There's a method that they use to create
this artificial surface.

3354
02:23:15,481 --> 02:23:18,180
And the whole thing was a fraud.
It was all fake and they,

3355
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:23,240
you know,
they put it in like famous museums and 

3356
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:23,240
shit.
It's a fascinating story.

3357
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:25,110
But the art experts,
just whatever the fuck it was,

3358
02:23:25,111 --> 02:23:30,111
they just knew immediately and they 
called bullshit on it when all these 

3359
02:23:30,111 --> 02:23:33,741
other people had already signed off on 
it and even paid for it and even asked 

3360
02:23:33,741 --> 02:23:33,750
one of the experts asked,
can you get your money back?

3361
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:35,460
Oh,
well now like what?

3362
02:23:35,670 --> 02:23:36,300
Blink,
huh?

3363
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:38,340
Yeah,
I definitely would like to read that.

3364
02:23:38,341 --> 02:23:39,180
That's interesting.
Yeah.

3365
02:23:39,181 --> 02:23:42,480
It's really interesting about split 
second judgements,

3366
02:23:42,481 --> 02:23:47,481
like weird things that you make.
Like you think you know something they 

3367
02:23:47,481 --> 02:23:47,820
ever tell you the counts story.
But this one,

3368
02:23:47,821 --> 02:23:49,230
one of the craziest girls you ever 
dated?

3369
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:54,150
I don't think so.
I meet calvin at the ones that place the

3370
02:23:54,151 --> 02:23:57,640
irish pub pub that was onsite dublin's 
dublin's taste to stand up.

3371
02:23:58,070 --> 02:24:00,570
I meet carolyn at dublin's and he's 
like,

3372
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:02,760
I want you to meet this girl I'm dating.
He brings a girl over.

3373
02:24:02,761 --> 02:24:04,470
The girl says hi to me.
I look at her and I go,

3374
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:06,570
come here.
And I pull them aside and go,

3375
02:24:06,571 --> 02:24:07,500
dude,
listen to me.

3376
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:09,780
She's fucking crazy trainer.
And he's like,

3377
02:24:09,781 --> 02:24:10,260
what?
I go,

3378
02:24:10,261 --> 02:24:11,340
she's crazy.
He goes,

3379
02:24:11,341 --> 02:24:11,990
how do you know?
I go,

3380
02:24:11,991 --> 02:24:13,140
I know.
I go,

3381
02:24:13,141 --> 02:24:14,520
I know crazy.
You gotta listen to me.

3382
02:24:14,550 --> 02:24:16,110
I go,
that's a fucking insane person.

3383
02:24:16,111 --> 02:24:17,180
That's a dangerous person.
Yeah.

3384
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:18,660
Nah man,
she's cool.

3385
02:24:18,661 --> 02:24:21,030
She just gets nervous around you.
Cut too.

3386
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:23,850
She's doing math.
She's a prostitute.

3387
02:24:25,890 --> 02:24:28,090
She has a pimp.
He finds her like,

3388
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:32,930
like after a breakup he runs into her 
street walking she street walking.

3389
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:35,610
He sees her in front of the coach and 
horses walking the street.

3390
02:24:36,060 --> 02:24:38,850
She's like,
lowest level of prostitute you can get.

3391
02:24:38,851 --> 02:24:42,070
Right.
How did he not come on time,

3392
02:24:42,090 --> 02:24:43,230
but yeah,
that it's that first,

3393
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:46,200
that first reaction,
whatever the fuck it is.

3394
02:24:46,201 --> 02:24:48,870
That guy that never done that before.
I've never done that ever.

3395
02:24:48,871 --> 02:24:50,970
I've never looked at someone really said
to my friend.

3396
02:24:50,971 --> 02:24:51,820
That girl's fucking.
Yeah.

3397
02:24:51,821 --> 02:24:52,630
Yeah,
it's a,

3398
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:55,140
it's a bit of a stretch because with 
callan,

3399
02:24:55,470 --> 02:24:58,080
almost every girl he dated was nuts 
until he met his wife.

3400
02:24:58,350 --> 02:25:03,350
There were all out of there.
It collins off to me about how he's 

3401
02:25:03,350 --> 02:25:03,350
like,
you gotta meet my friend.

3402
02:25:03,350 --> 02:25:04,140
Yeah.
And I'm like,

3403
02:25:04,170 --> 02:25:09,170
oh cool.
Like four times I did it and then I'm 

3404
02:25:09,170 --> 02:25:09,170
like,
like a fucking.

3405
02:25:09,170 --> 02:25:09,690
LiTerally at like a turtle will show up 
and I'll be like,

3406
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:11,520
you know a turtle.
He's too nice.

3407
02:25:11,730 --> 02:25:12,930
Yeah,
fucking counting.

3408
02:25:13,590 --> 02:25:15,510
Just likes everybody.
Oh my buddy.

3409
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:18,810
And now you fucking texted me all the 
time because buddy's crazy math.

3410
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:21,170
It's trying to get you in the olympics.
I'm like,

3411
02:25:21,480 --> 02:25:24,340
I'm working out too hard for this shit.
I don't like stretching.

3412
02:25:26,590 --> 02:25:30,250
Oh,
that's my favorite blink story though.

3413
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:32,100
I knew someThing about it.
I'm like,

3414
02:25:32,110 --> 02:25:33,820
what?
I just looked at him like,

3415
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:35,320
oh,
this is not good.

3416
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:37,270
Yeah.
I believe in that shit for sure.

3417
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:39,100
Especially with women.
Women's intuition,

3418
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:41,810
but haven't you been called?
I've been fooled before that rough tour.

3419
02:25:41,890 --> 02:25:42,480
Yeah.
Yeah,

3420
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:43,240
yeah,
of course.

3421
02:25:43,310 --> 02:25:44,680
Let's see with him.
But in this,

3422
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:49,800
in the book a gift of fear,
they say that like you always knew 

3423
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:49,800
somehow though.
Yeah.

3424
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:50,860
But I think you always think that when 
shit goes wrong.

3425
02:25:50,861 --> 02:25:51,820
True retrospect.
You're like,

3426
02:25:51,821 --> 02:25:53,390
god damn fucking.
No,

3427
02:25:53,630 --> 02:25:55,180
no.
I knew it.

3428
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:58,690
Didn't follow my instincts.
Could be some fill in the blank.

3429
02:25:58,700 --> 02:26:01,270
Bullshit.
Speaking of fill in the blank.

3430
02:26:01,271 --> 02:26:02,260
If you're looking for something to do 
tonight.

3431
02:26:02,350 --> 02:26:04,560
Chris delea is new.
Netflix special.

3432
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:09,520
That's how you should do your podcast,
man.

3433
02:26:09,540 --> 02:26:14,540
Shit.
Do just a bunch of random plugs out of 

3434
02:26:14,540 --> 02:26:14,540
nowhere.
It is.

3435
02:26:14,540 --> 02:26:17,420
It's on netflix.
Is this your second or third one on 

3436
02:26:17,420 --> 02:26:17,420
netflix?
Special.

3437
02:26:17,420 --> 02:26:17,930
Second one on neTflix.
What was the other one comes centrally.

3438
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:18,830
Centrally?
Yeah.

3439
02:26:19,810 --> 02:26:23,650
Netflix don't take over the game.
I did my first one on comedy central and

3440
02:26:23,651 --> 02:26:25,330
it was,
it was still.

3441
02:26:25,331 --> 02:26:26,880
That was still the place to be.
Yeah.

3442
02:26:26,890 --> 02:26:31,890
And then my second one I was like,
I'll do it on netflix and now it's just 

3443
02:26:31,890 --> 02:26:33,790
like,
you're pretty prolific too.

3444
02:26:33,791 --> 02:26:38,791
Like when did you do your first one?
I was 33 and then that's no 31.

3445
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:42,100
Uh,
so four Years ago.

3446
02:26:42,101 --> 02:26:43,100
So 2013?
No.

3447
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:45,370
So what wIll be my last one came out in 
2014.

3448
02:26:45,670 --> 02:26:46,120
Oh,
okay.

3449
02:26:46,121 --> 02:26:51,121
And then my,
the one before that came out when I was 

3450
02:26:51,121 --> 02:26:51,121
31.
So 2012.

3451
02:26:51,121 --> 02:26:52,480
Yeah,
I did kinda to back to back.

3452
02:26:52,510 --> 02:26:54,700
Right.
And then my agent was like,

3453
02:26:54,790 --> 02:26:55,510
I was like,
I want to do.

3454
02:26:55,511 --> 02:26:57,760
I wanted to do this one last year.
And he was like,

3455
02:26:57,860 --> 02:26:59,770
my agent was like,
how many specialists do you want to do?

3456
02:26:59,771 --> 02:27:01,090
And I was like,
that's a really good point.

3457
02:27:01,330 --> 02:27:02,890
I'll wait.
That's not a good point.

3458
02:27:02,891 --> 02:27:04,630
fire fucking agent.
Listen,

3459
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:05,680
listen,
fuck face.

3460
02:27:05,681 --> 02:27:10,681
You tell me what I'm working in toledo.
Don't tell me he wasn't telling me what 

3461
02:27:12,101 --> 02:27:12,900
to do,
but I was like,

3462
02:27:13,210 --> 02:27:15,300
he was making you as bitch.
That's what I think.

3463
02:27:15,301 --> 02:27:16,460
I'm his bitch.
Well,

3464
02:27:16,480 --> 02:27:20,760
the way I feel about dalea is he says 
agent,

3465
02:27:21,070 --> 02:27:24,160
he's the dude is fucking hilarious.
He's a great guy.

3466
02:27:24,161 --> 02:27:26,810
But he is his age.
They were.

3467
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:29,940
What's a collar on him just to keep them
in when,

3468
02:27:30,690 --> 02:27:33,130
when he goes to his office and the puts 
it,

3469
02:27:33,320 --> 02:27:34,250
call him.
He's asked me,

3470
02:27:34,251 --> 02:27:34,930
we want a glass of water.

3471
02:27:34,930 --> 02:27:39,930
It gives them a bowl bowl on the ground.
